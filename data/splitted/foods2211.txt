review/summary: Gojis are good but not from Navitas
review/text: The Goji is no doubt a 'superfood' and I've been having them for a long time and so may have become a goji connoisseur. The last time i bought these from Navitas and they just weren't good. They didn't taste good, very dry and worst of all they had a lot of fungus/yeast growing in them. Usually all dried fruit will have some yeast on them but these had just a lot of it, to the point that it made me sick despite of throwing away the ones that had turned black due to it.<br />I gave a bag to my boss since i wanted him to try the goji, which he had previously liked, but had to take it back from him for the reason.<br />Navitas is perhaps a good company and gojis are not made in a factory, but so is a lot of other packaged food and the seller needs to QC the product they sell.<br />Long live the Goji!

review/summary: Don't get hyped up by the name Tibet.
review/text: When I first wrote this review, the product description had "Tibetan Plateau", "Tibet", and "Tibetan Goji Berries" all over the place. I'm glad to see it has been corrected just for the sake of consumer accuracy, although the product picture still shows "Tibetan Goji Berries" at the top.<br /><br />I think this is a great product - my wife and I both like the taste and will continue to buy. I have purchased several different products from Navitas and have never had an issue (other than the product description on this item when I first purchased).<br /><br />Don't buy into the marketing hype of a company that says their Goji berries are from the Tibetan Plateau. First off China has control of Tibet. So Tibet = China. Second the Tibetan plateau where all these berries were supposedly grown is too cold and too dry for a berry producing plant. Search it for yourself. All Goji and Wolfberry products are "Imported from China".

review/summary: Extremely disappointed, dry and brittle compared to other brands I've tried
review/text: I'm extremely disappointed with these berries.  I gave them a 1 star, however, if I was allowed I wouldn't have given any stars.  I usually get Heaven Mountain berries and thought I would try these because they can be included as part of a free shipping order.  Big mistake on my part.  These berries are dry and brittle and have a slightly bitter taste.  The others that I usually get (heaven ones) are moister plumper and have a sweeter flavor.  Do yourself a favor and get something other than these.  You can get the Heaven Mountain ones from a partner company with Amazon - Vitacost.  It would be nice if they were listed here.  Anyway, be forewarned.<br /><br />Cheers

review/summary: made me sick!
review/text: I have purchased these a couple times from whole foods and decided to purchase on the internet due to lower price, however when I received them I took a handful and went to work, 20 minutes later I was struck with nausea and lower back pain..(kidney pain maybe?) I drank a lot of water and a couple hours later it went away. I didnt think it had anything to do with the berries then and a couple days later I was snacking on them and was struck with intense nausea and ill feeling all over, I was very close to vomiting for most of the day I felt AWFUL. These were without a doubt the culprit, I am very healthy and didnt change anything else in my diet at the time :( unfortunately I have a huge bag left to go to waste. After researching I found this brand to be inadequate in quality control and similar issues with their goji berries since they are grown in china and the quality control is sub par. It is very disappointing because this brand has an image that you think you can trust..ahhh it is a shame.

review/summary: AWFUL-Moldy and poor quality
review/text: This was my first experience with goji berries so I was excited to try them.  I actually spit them out they were so bad.  Tasteless except for a moldy/salty taste!  Thinking that maybe this is how they are supposed to taste, I asked a coworker about them.  He had a bag and let me try his...they taste NOTHING like what I got.  HIs actually had a flavor that was berry like.  I looked at the product I received closer and can see mold growing on the berries.  Also the berries in the bag are mostly just hacked up pieces-not a lot of whole berries.  I will steer clear of Navitas brand from now on!

review/summary: Great daily morning snack
review/text: This product was recommended by my sister's OBGYN.  She found that these berries helped relieve her heat flashes and night sweats as going through "the change".  I began taking a handful of these each morning over a year ago.  Since then I have had only a few minor heat flashes, have had rare instances of waking at 4 AM as was usual, and less mood swings.  Being an elementary teacher I am exposed to many germs. As a benefit of taking these I have noticed that I jump back more quickly when sick, and am not sick as often.  The dry bitter taste doesn't bother me as I take them while eating breakfast.  My sister mixes them with craisins and other dried fruits.  Several friends have also seen the benefits of these berries.

review/summary: These Goji Berries Tastes Like Dusty Old Paper
review/text: I just received my goji berries. They taste awful and "old." Not good. They taste like cardboard. And I think the berries have been collecting dust in some storage bin somewhere in China. The only redeeming factor may possibly be that I can at least use some of the seeds of the berries and plant them. Maybe not though, since these berries seem to be old and dusty.<br />What I got was crap. Maybe I'm the exception. Though other people had a similar experience from past reviews.<br /><br />Be Warned!

The berries are moldy & lots of bits & pieces of seeds, stems, & half eaten parts of berries from insects or worms perhaps. It tasted like mold.  I checked the stale date, 9/26/13.  Yikes!  I can't imagine eating these a year and a half from now.  The item is not returnable.  It says USDA organic on package.  It's a product from China. Very poor quality.  I don't trust it, & will never buy it again.

review/summary: Top quality at a great price
review/text: Whether you believe the goji berry hype or not, Navitas Naturals goji berries are USDA certified organic and are of a high quality compared to bulk goji berries available in asian markets. I would be very concerned about pesticide content in bulk berries. Amazon's price for this size package is amazing; my local health food store charges $23.99 for this exact product. If you can use the occasional Amazon coupon with your purchcase then the per bag price is even lower. These berries taste great added to oatmeal just before finishing cooking, added to a cup of tea, or just out of hand like a raisin.

review/summary: Pretty good gojis
review/text: I must admit I bought this with a little concern, because even of the great price Amazon offers to subscribe and save users, some of the negative reviews below made me wonder of the quality of this berries. I trust in Navitas because earlier I have bought Navitas Maca and Acai and to my personal taste both are very acceptable.<br /><br />When I recieved the gojis, I carefully open the bag and at the smell of the product is not very pleasent but it is not adverse also. I bought them not to eat them right out of the box as a snack but as part of my morning smoothies, so I just put a tablespoon of berries in water for 5-10 minutes to hidrate them and then to the blender.<br /><br />I have not notice the mold nor the stomach problems some people have written about before, so for me this product is very good and made a great addition the the nutrition factor to my smoothies.

review/text: I first read and heard about the benefits of Goji berries, while vacationing on the island of Mallorca two years ago.  I immediately went to the local market and found them being sold in pre-packaged bags and also loose.  I have been taking one teaspoon of Goji berries softened in a little water every day ever since and have not had one single cold in two years.<br />I guess everything that is written about its amazing benefits is true.  An amazing product, which my family and many of my friends have been taking with the same positive effect.  However, I was told that the goji berries imported from Nepal are much better than the ones from China.  Not sure why, but I have taken both.

review/summary: It is decent Goji but not premium product
review/text: This is a one pound of dried Goji berries that are smaller than I am used to. It is also drier than other Gojis I tried. That could be an advantage since the product is sold by weight, you do get more product than if it was moist.<br /><br />Other reviewers have noted moldy gojis in their bag and I did notice my bag having the same issues. I just picked them off.<br /><br />Other reviewers have noted that in Chinatown you could get goji berries cheaper. I have gotten them in Chinatown and I noticed they came with warning that it has to be rinsed and cooked. I guess it would be good to be used in cereals or in homemade granola where you can use wet cooked gojis. In this day of instant gratification, I do not see myself reaching out and snacking on the Chinatown version of goji that I have to rinse it.<br /><br />Will I continue to get this Navitas product from Amazon ? Yes as it has been certified to be Organic and Kosher (meaning clean). The price is decent. So I can snack on them and get the nutritional benefits. Goji is said to have one of the highest concentration of Zeaxanthin, an antioxidant important for vision and it is being studied for prevention of Macular Degeneration. Note that Goji juice does not have a measurable amount of Zeaxanthin. You have to get it from dried fruit.<br /><br />I bought a container of Goji berries in a reputable Chinese Medicine Pharmacy in Beijing and that was like the best Goji berries I had. It was larger in size and they were evenly the same size. I paid nine dollars for the half pound container. I find that getting a regular shipment from Amazon to be a  tad more convenient than going to Beijing to get Goji berries.<br /><br />4-15-11 Addendum.<br /><br />I got my second bag of this product and it was a much greater improvement over the first bag I received. The berries were actually larger (just like the ones I got in Beijing!) and it was more moister. And it actually tasted sweeter. Looks like they may have gotten a different supplier and this bring closer to the premium grade. One colleague of mine who is the head of Nutrition Society for Optometrists tells me that a store in Pasadena, California sells Goji berries that are moist like raisins. I have not seen those but sounds good and sounds expensive! Anyhow, the second bag of this specific product shows a much greater improvement and I am very happy!

But my husband has a extreame sweet tooth & he seems to like them just fine!  They are slightly hard but they are chewy.  You can eat them alone, add them to a trailmix, oatmeal, breads, muffins, veggies, I think you get the idea!  A great way to nourish you body!  I will buy these again!

review/summary: IMPORTANT INFO!
review/text: OK.  I got these berries very quickly.  They taste a little dry, like tea bits really.  You can reconstitute them in water very quickly, but remember to drink whatever juice is leftover to get all of the nutrients.  They have a very distinct taste: some will like it, some won't.  But, here is the *IMPORTANT INFO*  Goji berries should not ever be eaten when you are having intestinal problems.  My husband caught an intestinal bug from our daughter, and then we received the berries, which he LOVES and ate in huge handfulls; well, goji berries should NEVER be eaten when you have diarreah, ever.  I found this information on several websites because we were wondering what was causing him so much pain.  Well, he has a bug, but it was made much worse by the large amount of dried berries he ate.  ****NOW, on the other hand, these berries are GREAT for constipation, and are good for just snacking on in moderation.  I wouldn't go and eat four huge handfulls in two days like my silly husband did.  No doubt, they are great for you.  So, this is a good review with just one caveat.  It's not listed on this page, so I thought it was important for you all to know when not to eat this superfood.

The only good part about it was that they sorta tasted ok after chewing on them a while.<br /><br />If you want really, really good goji berries get Heaven Mountain brand.<br /><br />They cost twice as much as these, but these aren't really worth anything, in my opinion.<br /><br />These are the best and well worth the price:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010EBEKU">Bija  Heaven Mountain Goji Berries 8-Ounces</a><br /><br />Do it right or don't do it!

review/summary: Comparison Video. Navitas Vs Himalayan
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>I did a taste test with The Himalania 8oz <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013KTNP4">Himalania 8 oz. Dried Raw Goji Berries - The Most Famous Berry in the Himalayas - Himalayan Goji Berry</a> vs the 16 ounce Navitas.<br /><br />The Himalania are MUCH better. But they cost almost twice as much, so if I had to buy again, which one would I buy? I'm not sure. The Navitas brand was crunchier (like a stale raisin. Not sure if I even like them. The Himalania were VERY good and addictive (which might be bad since you might eat too many).<br /><br />Check out the video, you can see I can even crack the Navitas brand in half. Sorry for the bad sound!!<br /><br />I rated it a 3 of 5 since it is "just ok". If you are buying them for power and nutrition, then they are fine. If you want the taste , then they are not worth it.<br /><br />Frank

review/summary: Quality going down hill
review/text: Each bag I've received has gotten drier and less appealing.  The last bag I received was mostly crunchy, so after a call to Navitas, they sent me a replacement of another item.  I've been ordering another brand that is pesticide free and about as juicy as rasins - I love them!  I still love Navitas' chocolate products.

review/text: I was surprised to see that I purchased these less than two weeks ago. They're GONE, all gone!<br /><br />I thought I would put them in granola, yoghurt, etc and I did ...once or twice... but I just ended up eating handful upon handful.<br /><br />I like to chew ;) And after a friend of mine asked me if I'd ever had "Jolly Ranchers' jelly beans -- which I am sure are great -- I declared that these are nature's jelly beans!<br /><br />And boy nature done good.<br /><br />Thus I am here to purchase more and am subscribing for them monthly for now... at least until my addiction slows and I can make these last more than a couple weeks!

review/summary: Goji berries, huh?
review/text: This is my first time trying goji berries, so unfortunately I can't speak for the quality of this product compared to others. I can say that the product arrived fast, well-packaged, and that all the berries are bright orange with no sign of mold/spots/nastiness so far. That's probably a good sign. ;)<br /><br />I'm not really wow-ed by these, though. I mean, they're little dried orange berries. Not a lot of flavor, especially when pre-soaked. They're aight, I guess. I might experiment with a couple other brands to gain perspective, but maybe some things aren't meant to be dried out and shipped halfway around the world.<br /><br />No complaints with the condition or quality of the product itself, though.

review/summary: A Great Additive to Cereals
review/text: Goji berries are an excellent source of Beta Carotene, Vitamin C and Anti-Oxidants.  They may not be big on flavor,(they don't taste bad - the taste is very subtle), but they make a great addition to hot cereals.  I use these as part of my own mueslix mixture, primarily for the C and Beta-Carotene, along with dried berries, a mixture of grains and some Grape Nuts and sunflower seeds.  They're not readily available in conventional stores, and health-food stores frequently carry just the goji extract.  The price may seem high, but a little goes a long way - and Amazon's price is very good, considering these are organic.  And they come from the Himalayas - how many of your nutritional supplements can make that claim?

review/text: I bought two bags of these so I could get free shipping.  I am glad I did because they are great!  I have been eating them everyday and would buy this exact kind again!  I am hooked.  I use the goji berries with fresh ginger ground up in water as an anti-inflammatory and they work.  I have a lot of inflammation and drinking this goji drink keeps it down.  I have to drink this drink throughout the day everyday as prescribed by my accupuncturist doctor.

I enjoy the taste and texture straight from the bag. The berries are not too sweet.  I did not find them too dry because they soften and become chewey, not tough. I have never tasted the fresh berry. I will buy more of these dried berries for a satisfying snack option.

review/text: This is the first time I purchased Goji Berries after reading all of the health benefits they have. The Navitas Naturals Brand through Amazon was the lowest priced I found on the web.  I really like the fact that there are no additives at all. They don't taste like any berry I've eaten. They are surprisingly moist and sometimes slightly sweet and other times a bit bitter (if you pop a handful into your mouth.) I found a small amount does satisfy your hunger quite well I eat them by themselves for lunch. They are really good mixed with chocolate chips, thrown in a salad even baked in cookies. I would certainly buy them again.

review/summary: Great Goji, Batman!
review/text: I am a believer in healing with nutrition, and the Goji Berry is key to a really healthy diet.  I use these in my oatmeal (Coaches Oats--steel cut oats--from Costco).  Just drop them into the oatmeal when you add it to the boiling water and they are perfect when the oatmeal is done.  I have also used them in oatmeal cookies.  I soak them for about an hour before mixing them into the cookie batter.<br /><br />Even  my boyfriend eats them :)  They are super sweet and a little bit tart.<br /><br />Some trivia on the Goji Berry:<br /><br />The Goji Berry is also called the Wolfberry. It is a bright orange-red berry that comes from a shrub that's native to China.<br /><br />They are touted to increase overall longevity, treat diabetes, high blood pressure, fever, and age-related eye problems. Goji berries are eaten raw, cooked, or dried (like raisins) and are used in herbal teas, juices, wines, and homeopathic medicines.  They say that they may prevent cancer and heart disease.  They increase the immune system and lower cholesterol.  It is said that they can even prevent against Alzeimer's.  They are full of antioxidants.<br /><br />Eating foods high in antioxidants and Vitamin A (such as the Goji Berry) may slow the aging process. It does this by minimizing damage from free radicals that injure cells and damage DNA. When a cell's DNA changes, the cell grows abnormally. Antioxidants can take away the destructive power of free radicals. By doing so, antioxidants help reduce the risk of some serious diseases.<br /><br />Other studies using goji berry juice founds benefits in mental well-being, and calmness, athletic performance, happiness, quality of sleep, and feelings of good health.<br /><br />Possible SIDE EFFECTS/contraindications:<br /><br />There may be some possible herb-drug interactions with goji berries. If you take warfarin (a blood thinner), you may want to avoid goji berries. Goji berries may also interact with diabetes and blood pressure drugs.  (interesting, as they are touted to help these maladies)<br /><br />Also, if you have pollen allergies, you may want to stay away from this fruit.

review/summary: Captain, there be nuts here!
review/text: Many nutritionists suggest that, rather than three squares, people should eat multiple small meals spread out over the course of the day. Among the many alleged benefits of this regime is an increased metabolic rate - which fosters weight loss by overcoming the body's tendency to slow the metabolic rate of starvation diets. Over the years, I am sure that many have read that a daily nut snack is a good thing (Google "nuts and your heart" and you will be returned an edifying page from the Mayo Clinic).<br /><br />Although I still extol the virtue of donuts, I decided that nuts might be a good alternative for my between meal snacks. Searching Amazon revealed this outstanding buy: 40 pounds of roasted/salted Spanish peanuts for $27 or about $.68/lb. A mistake - possibly since a 20 pound package sells for $69 and the 5-pound package sells for $19!?<br /><br />What I received was a box, in which was a plastic bag/liner, unceremoniously filled with peanuts - all 40 pounds! These jumbo (about 1/2 the size of the typical peanut and only slightly larger than the usual Spanish peanut) are roasted and salted. I observe a no-salt-added diet so I place a few pounds in a colander and rinse off the salt, placing the rinsed nuts in a warm oven (I use a convection over) to quickly dry the batch. I then consume 1/4 cup of nuts twice a day: between breakfast and lunch and between lunch and supper. A word of caution: 1/2 cup of Spanish peanuts contains about 425 calories: I have reduced the caloric content of my other meals accordingly (an alternative would be to have only 1/4 cup per day).<br /><br />After all is said and done, I received 40-pounds of great peanuts for $28 and free shipping (which cancelled the $30 shipping charge). As of this writing, this item is not available, although the 20-pound/$69 is.<br /><br />As an aside, for those of you who do not regularly visit Amazon, my experiences urge regular visits to all departments. Be it foods, clothes, car parts, electronics - you name it, I have saved thousands by thinking outside the box (stores); add the free shipping and no-sales tax benefits and you cannot beat Amazon. I would also note that I find Amazon customer service outstanding - fully supporting the refund/return policies.<br /><br />One final note: I did not judge the plastic bag sufficient for long-term/air-tight storage.

review/summary: RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: "DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT THEM!"
review/text: First of all these things taste delicious. They really taste like there is milk in your cereal. When in the office I have one every day for breakfast. I do a lot of coast to coast air travel and I never leave home without a couple of Cheerio's Milk 'n cereal bars in my carry on bag. They're life savers when you're stuck in the airport or on a long flight, since the airlines have cut down on their snack service. My local Safeway never has them, so I've started ordering them by the case from Amazon. I wish I would of thought of this long ago!! P.S. The servings are larger than the average snack bar, and I've proven they stay fresh, even when left in my bag, during a coast to coast to coast round trip!

review/text: I love all the Fiber One cereals.  I look at the fiber range which seems to go from 35 to 51 or 57. I will usually opt for<br />the most high fiber content. I have also started eating Fiber One bars.  They have low calories, lots of nutrients,<br />are delicious and low priced.<br /><br />Buying Fiber One for $12.95 at Amazon is almost criminal.  This past week many CVS stores sold 2 boxes for $6.00<br />Walmart, Publix and other grocery/supermarkets have lower prices. I haven't checked warehouse clubs. There is<br />no Costco in my area.<br /><br />If far away from any store, trying buying by contacting their websites.  In this tough eocnomy every penny saved now = a dime tomorrow.<br />I buy many other things from Amazon. But based on these prices,  food will not be included.

review/summary: Excellent source of fiber
review/text: This is one of the tastier high fiber cereals on the market. A single serving will give you a whopping 13g of fiber, but only 6g of sugar, which is just the right amount to have a "lightly sweetened" cereal as the box says. The whole grain flakes have a nice texture that I much prefer over bran flakes, and do not get soggy in milk. The little honey clusters are crunchy but very easy to chew.<br /><br />While this cereal is a good source for fiber, a single serving has only 3g protein. Therefore I eat this together with Special K Protein Plus, which has 10g protein per serving. Add a banana, apple, blueberries, etc. and you have a hearty breakfast that will last you to lunchtime.<br /><br />Shop for price. I bought this at my local Costco for about a third of the price on Amazon.

review/text: FYI: The "Natural flavors" claimed on the container appear to be "dust" and "all-purpose flour," and they completely overpower anything you add it to. The serving size (in order to achieve the nutrition it offers on its label) is 3 scoops, not 1 as it claims on this page. But it doesn't matter if you choose to add 3 scoops or 1 scoop, or whether you add it to skim milk or juice - as the container recommends - the powder will never "mix" with any liquid. It just floats on top and clumps together in little flour-like balls, which may be pleasing to a starving person in Ethiopia, but not so much to someone who has the option of eating real food instead of this junk.

review/summary: If you like figs, you'll love these
review/text: I've bought five different growers' figs from Amazon - though I suspect it's one big Fresno cooperative that separates by type and dryness. For sweetness, freshness, and just overall taste, the Sun Maid Calimyrna win hands down, BUT they are the most expensive. They come in a 6-ounce bad instead of everybody else's 8. And be careful: Sun Maid also has the darker figs in 8 ounce packs, and they're plump and sweet as well, but I can only get those in the market right now.<br /><br />The best buy is Blue Ribbon Orchard Choice Figs. They're quite a bit drier, but taste as good. They're also smaller, so watch the calorie count. There's a tendency to east 8-12 of these little ones without thinking that you're going through 240 calories fairly quickly.<br /><br />I see no difference between organic and ... what, inorganic ... except that organic costs more. All five that I've bought run between $2.50 and $3.00 a pack, about 60 cents less than market price. But all five have exactly the same calorie count, vitamins, and additives or lack thereof. All come from Fresno, and the two differences are in size and mositness.<br /><br />If I were a rich man (play Fiddler in the background), I'd buy a truckload of the Sun Main. Oh, yeah, most of the Sun Maid Calimyna don't have stems to worry about. On the other hand, sometrimes stems make for good "handles."

review/text: I was disappointed that the figs were very dry.  I used to be able to find this product locally, and I preferred Calimyrna to the Mission figs that are available locally, so I went on line to find a source.  I have opened only 2 packages.  In the first, they were all dry; in the second, the last 2 figs were moist and sticky, the way I like them.  I had left the package in an air tight container for several days - maybe that softened them.  Or, it may be that this was last year's crop, since I know that this is a seasonal product.

review/summary: Dry as Shoe Leather and Tasteless -- AVOID!
review/text: Received these figs from Amazon and was horribly disappointed.  They are almost inedible.  They are extremely tough and as dry as shoe leather.  There is very little fig "meat" inside the leathery skin.<br /><br />I will look elsewhere from now on.  I have had Calimyrna figs before and know what to expect.  These "figs" from Sun-Maid are only fit as a food source for starving cattle!  Where is the quality control at Sun-Maid?

review/summary: Too expensive
review/text: Give me a reason to buy from you? Nespresso website is half the price. 0.57/caps and 6.95 for shipping.<br />Total is .70 per caps shipping included and yours is 1.22 per caps for the same quantity!<br />I usually buys on amazon because I find good deals.<br />You should revise your pricing or change business.<br />I'll update my review if you change your prices to be at least cheaper that Nespresso themselves.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I have been using flax seed for several years.  I usually buy a major brand.  This time I thought I would try a different seller.  It was shipped promptly.  However, it contained a lot of stem pieces and other debris.  Because it would have cost as much to return it, I decided to clean it.  It took abouit three hours and I got most of the debris out.  Having been raised on a farm, I know how grain looks when it is harvested.  However, I have never had this trouble with the main supplier.

review/summary: Celestial Seasonings in K cups
review/text: I really love the lemon zing of this tea when brewed in the Keurig K cup brewer.  It seems to have more flavor than it does when steeped in the regular way.  I only wish more of Celestial Seasonings herbal varieties were available in K cups.  I'm hooked on K-cups for tea as well as coffee and hot cocoa is also excellent.

review/summary: A super-great tea!!
review/text: This is a great deal for the 2-pack of lemon zinger tea.  I'm a big coffee fan so the tea has lasted me for a while but is awesome for those cold nights - it's also decaf so you're not left wired!  It's strong enough that I keep it in the Keurig to 'top-off' my current cup of tea and it still has a great strong flavor.  You won't find a better price than here on amazon, especially if you add coffee and get free shipping!
