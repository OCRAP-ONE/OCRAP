review/summary: Love these!!!
review/text: When I bought these online I was hoping they would be delicious. I got them in and immediatly made hot dogs for the family. With these buns I found they needed to be microwaved to really get a hot dog bun taste to them. However, what I found to be even better is that with the size they looked more like hoagies to me, so of course I had to make hoagies and steak and cheese sandwiches with these!!! I made the steak and cheese, then I put the sandwich together and into the oven. OMG!!! I will never buy anything else again!! I know some people just want hot dog buns, but I found a better use for them. My kids still love to have their hot dogs on these buns, but I prefer them for steak and cheese. I am happy and the kids are happy. Some people complain because these are not precut, ummm, so what!?! if you have a knife you can split them the way you want:) these are also great for making pizza. I know these are  hot dog buns, but I really dont like hot dogs so found other uses. again my kids love them with hot dogs!!

review/summary: Multiple Allergies
review/text: I have multiple food allergies, i need gluten free, egg free & soy free foods. I think these are great and have a good soft texture unlike most gluten free breads.  I am so happy that I can still eat  gluten free breads without soy & egg in it.  For me these are awesome.  Much better than even GF bakery stuff I've tried in the past.  But then again, for me it's hard to find gluten free, egg free, soy free things.  Ener-G & Enjoy Life goods are a god-send!!  Thank you!

review/text: I have tried several different brands, and these are my favorite by far! Many are too hard to wrap around the hot dog. I microwaved one of the EnerG Hot Dog Buns for about 15 seconds, and that made it better.....Still VERY GOOD though, much better than any other I have found!

review/summary: Awesome, and do your homework.
review/text: These buns are spectacular, and I feel sorry for anyone who just rips the package open, slaps a hot dog in, and takes a bite. To be edible, they *must* be heated in the microwave until they're hot to the touch. Be careful not to burn yourself, but if you don't heat them enough, they're very dry and unsatisfying.<br /><br />It can also help to get a tiny bit of moisture into the microwave with them. I usually heat mine on a plate I've splashed with a tiny bit of water. Or sometimes I'll try flicking just a bit of water onto the buns themselves before heating (you can easily overdo it).<br /><br />Done properly, they're awfully close to the real thing. Which is an amazing treat if you can't have gluten.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />I've found that if you *really* want these to turn out well, steaming them is the way to go. My current favorite approach is to put a layer of water in a big pan, put the hot dogs in the water, stick a steaming insert above the water, put the buns in the insert, and then simmer everything for about ten minutes. The buns can get a bit *too* damp on the outside, but they'll be soft and tasty. Play around with it, experiment a bit, and you should be able to find the softness/moistness balance which makes you happy.

review/summary: As close as I've found....
review/text: Although I'm not a big fan of Ener-G products overall, their hot dog buns are as close as I've found to regular wheat buns.  Like most gluten-free items they need a little heating first to improve texture: I microwave them in a damp paper towel for about 35 seconds before eating, but they hold a hot dog/brat with condiments without either breaking apart in the middle or crumbling.  And, they have a neutral flavor which does not detract from the meat.

review/text: I have not been able to find a bun that was edible until I tried these. They are  much better after being warmed in a microwave for about 25 seconds.

review/text: These were okay. I didn't like that they weren't presliced. They were VERY thick & heavy. My daughter liked them for the novelty of eating a bun again... but finished the hotdog by itsself after trying half of this.. (She threw the rest away.) You have to microwave or cook these first. They were more trouble than they were worth.<br /><br />I wish they'd make them with the same recipe as their "light" white rice bread loaf... they'd probably be really good...

review/summary: Ener-G Hot Dog Buns Not Just for Hot Dogs
review/text: I have purchased these locally but recently had a hard time locating them. These are the closest thing to a sub roll that I used to enjoy before my Celiac Diagnosis. I Wrap one in a paper Towel and microwave on low power to soften up and give it the fresh baked softness. I was missing my favorite sub of Ham and Cheese with my favorite toppings so I used this as a sub roll instead of just for hot dogs. GREAT!! For some reason this small bun fills me up like the old regular 8 inch large sub roll I used to be accustomed to. Absorption of food for Celiacs when following diet, multiplies significantly as your brain gets the signal that you are being nourished thus having your appetite being satisfied sooner. I recommend freezing the remainder of buns once the seal has been broken to maintain freshness. Actually freezing helps the steaming process in the Microwave. ENJOY. I want to try making a garlic bread or Bruschetta with these. I bet it will be great.More suggestions. Toaster oven pizza....

review/text: A bit too much bread for me for a hot dog bun but it tastes good and does the trick! I may try making a hot dog sandwich (slicing several pieces of hot dog into the roll) to make it a bit more substantial and less bready. Another reviewer commented that these are great for hoagies and I totally agree! Looking forward to making some sandwiches too. I will continue to buy these for special occasions but they are a bit pricey. I will stick with their light tapioca bread (you can purchase here on amazon.com too) for every day use!

review/text: My family is gluten intolerant. Was hoping for a roll that replaces the good old one made from wheat flour. Has the same shape - albeit larger -  but the bread overpowers the taste of a hot dog..<br /><br />I did find that if you remove most of the inside part of the bun and put in two hotdogs that the taste improves and its not so "bready". Was not overly impressed but since we cannot eat wheat this so far is the best I've found.<br /><br />"in the valley of the blind, the one eyed man is king".

review/text: This flavor rocks, as a Blueberry flavor lover this product is entirely up to par, the flavors as rich as blue candy. There is a stigma with this product that it is to be used with lower quality herbs, but i find it is best used to add a fruity blast to already amazing smelling herb blends.<br />If you want to smoke Tasty Puff on a cigarette I would not recommend the flavor Blueberry Thrill, i would recommend the "Convicted Melon" flavor. The blueberry IS delicious, but on a cigarette you have to use a lot to get a strong flavor. the watermelon is the strongest of the fruit flavors ive tried, and its amazing at mixing with tobacco flavor; seriously, try it.<br /><br />If you are thinking about getting some Tasty Puff, you HAVE to pick up BlueBerry Thrill, it will blow your mind.

review/summary: The best red beans & rice mixture available and it cooks well in the rice cooker too!
review/text: Vigo knows how to combine flavors.  Living in the South, we have occasion to eat "real" home made red beans and rice fairly frequently.  Vigo, by far, makes the best store bought variety on the market.  Cook it up and add some hot sausage to it and you've got a meal that will be devoured in no time flat.<br /><br />We been long time fans of their Red Beans & Rice and Black Beans & Rice mixtures and I was delighted to find that they easily cook in our rice cooker by following the following steps:  I measured the contents of the package and then simply added an extra half cup of water.  Even if you're cooking 2 packages you only add an extra half cup of water more than the contents.  For example, if there is 1 cup of rice & seasoning, I'd use 1 and 1/2 cups of water in my rice cooker.  It never fails to come out perfect every time!

review/summary: Finally got the job done!
review/text: We have been using the older wooden box traps (same mechanism feature) successfully for years, so when my dad began having big problems with gophers in and around the garden on their property, I sent him these, figuring he could put them to use before the weather got too much towards winter and the ground began to freeze (he's in Colorado).  Within 2 days he called, delighted that he had already removed one gopher, and the next day again called that he had caught a second.  He was also able to see if the trap had sprung by using binoculars, a nice benefit. If there are any more gophers to get, I haven't heard, but these traps paid for themselves immediately with the results!<br /><br />Made of plastic, I believe they will last much longer than our wooden ones, and we still repair our wooden ones successfully, enough to get the occasional mole.<br /><br />All in all, if you have problems with pocket gophers, I highly recommend these to remove them.

I think one of the reasons this design works so well is the trigger mechanism is far enough into the trap that by the time the gopher pushes enough dirt into the trap to trigger it, the gopher is well into the trap and gets caught.

review/text: I only bought this trap after i could no longer find the "Black Hole" (which worked every time). I must have set this trap at least 30 times and never once caught anything. Finally found the "Black Hole" gopher trap again, bought a couple of 'em and been killing gophers without fail ever since. By the way the only reason i needed more in the first place is because I would get lazy and fail to stake the trap down- next day, it would be gone courtesy of a coyote or fox. There's a reason for the different pricing- one works , the other doesn't

review/summary: 40+ years of Success!
review/text: My dad started selling these traps in the 1950s. They originally were a treated wood but eventually they would get chewed on by gophers (revenge motivated), stolen by fox, or decayed by weather (forgotten for months). They sold for $3 each or so much a case. In our area a bounty was paid for the tail (today its at $3 each). I had at one time 12 traps and made some good money trapping gophers. Over the years, I've trapped hundreds of the little bastxxs. Why the hatred? Pocket gophers will eat your garden alive, drop 8' Norway pines, ruin your lawn and destroy underground electric wires. What's worse, if you let them be, the fox and badgers will come in to get them and then you'll see what real dirt moving and destruction means. A war zone!<br /><br />This new plastic version works as well and doesn't get damaged by weather but costs significantly more than other open trap types. However, they work better than any other trap I've used as they are easy to set, no wounded gophers (never seen a live one yet)and will get the gopher 4 out of 5 times. That said, here's some observations:<br /><br />1. To find a gopher run, take a pointed steel rod (I have one with a cross handle on the top and a stepping bar on one side toward the bottom). Go around the outside of the latest gopher mound inserting the rod 6-12" into the ground and about 12" apart. When the rod "falls" through the ground after initial insertion, you've found the tunnel. Take a square head spade and dig a square hole , flat bottom, with the tunnel at either or both ends. (Use two traps or seal one tunnel if your in the middle of a run). Butt the set trap up tight against the tunnel. Lightly cover the top of the trap with dirt (grass over the tiny gaps where the metal parts enter the trap, then dirt). Not too much as it will eventually interfer with the spring strength. Leave the hole open at the end (I've caught many gophers with the air hole closed too, especially if the trap is in a runway - tunnel going both ways).<br /><br />2. You may catch the gopher fairly quick but I leave traps overnight before moving them. If the trap doesn't get tripped after a day, there is a 90% chance its plugged with dirt. If full of dirt, reset. However, each time its plugged, the chance of trapping the gopher (they get smarter each time) is significantly reduced. After plugged twice, your chance of catching him there is near zero. Move the trap to another portion of their maze and try again.<br /><br />3. Wear old, worn gloves so you leave no scent. I've never washed a trap after a dead gopher though.<br /><br />4. To remove a dead gopher, take the box trap, turn it on end over the garbage, hold the spring bar down and shake hard. The gopher will pop out. (A little messy but it works in rural areas...Take the dead gopher and fling him in the middle of the yard. I've never had a gopher still there the next day as many, many other animals love gophers for a decent meal. Is this green or what??)<br /><br />5. Don't settle for just one gopher. I always reset the trap into the same hole and its 50/50 you'll catch another. If you think you have them all, remove the trap and leave the tunnel open. If it fills back up after a day, there's more in the maze.<br /><br />6. Gophers love easy digging so they will follow easy digging directions. Unfortunately underground electric wire make for easy digging and a gopher will follow the wire. For some reason (revenge again?) they will chew on the plastic wire coating as the enjoy the easy digging. Weeks or months later when a wire nick corrodes and when the lights go off, you'll know they were busy.<br /><br />7. If you have fox, coyote or badgers in the area, stake your trap down with chain and an anchor. If not, a predator will gladly remove the dead gopher but unfortunately with your trap. And you'll never see the trap again.<br /><br />8. With minimal care (flag so you don't forget where your traps are and anchor when necessary)these traps will last almost forever. I'm still using an original wood box trap from the 1960s. All beat up but still catches gophers.<br /><br />If catching gophers with minimal effort is the goal, you can't go wrong with this proven box design. Good hunting!

review/summary: Free lunch is over ...
review/text: I usually do not write reviews on Amazon (or anywhere else for that matter), but I really have to make an exception in this case because of how well this device works.  It is rare for any device to work exactly as expected, but the Victor Blackbox Gopher Trap works above and beyond any expectations that I had for it.  I do not work for the Victor company, and I have no financial stake in the sales of their products.  I am simply an exasperated homeowner who got fed up wih gophers tearing up his property and decided to give this device a try.<br /><br />I had used poison pellets, smoke bombs, water hose, and those silly sonic devices... nothing worked and those gophers were probably laughing at me.  With the Blackbox, it's nearly a sure thing.  Also, you actually get to see the results with a dead gopher right in front of you, unlike smoke bombs and poison which are always a guessing game as to whether or not they actually did their job.<br /><br />Within 2 day of getting this product, I had already caught 3 gophers.  One of those gophers was caught less than 1 hour after I set the trap.  Free lunch on my property is now officially over.<br /><br />The key to the effectiveness of this trap is to find a freshly dug up gopher mound.<br /><br />My sure kill method:<br /><br />1) Find a freshly dug up gopher mound.<br />2) Dig out the mound until you find the tunnel.<br />3) Place the activated trap flush with the entrance of the tunnel, with the small round hole (on one side of the trap) facing outward.<br />4) Cover up the gaps at the top, sides and bottom of the trap with dirt so that it looks like the tunnel extends into the Blackbox, but make sure the opening to the trap is unobstructed from inside their tunnel.<br /><br />The idea is to make the trap seem like an extension of the gopher's tunnel, and by instinct the gopher will head towards that small open hole on the other side of the trap to plug it up (they don't like any openings into their tunnels).  Once he enters the trap, it's goodnight Gracie.  This trap is so strong that the gopher will be nearly snapped in half.<br /><br />Before getting the Blackbox, I had also tried using a "Macabee" gopher trap (the one with the 2 pincers that snap together) but the gopher simply pushed that trap out of his tunnel.  The Macabee is also a lot more risky to use and harder to set (in terms of triggering it accidentally on your hand).  The Blackbox is safer to use and much easier to set because the trigger mechanism and the killing device is contained fully within the box itself.  The Macabee trap can also be dragged away by a dying gopher if it is not properly secured.  There is definitely no chance of a gopher dragging away a Blackbox.<br /><br />In summary, I wish I had used the Blackbox from the beginning.  It would have saved me a lot of time, money, frustration and parts of my yard.<br /><br />UPDATE Aug-17-2011:  I have just posted some pics as proof of the effectiveness of this device.  After 13 captures within the first 4 months of use, I have not seen any more gopher activity since April 2011. I guess word got out in the gopher community that there is now a steep price of admission onto this property.

review/summary: 100% kill rate
review/text: I had struggled with gas bombs, flooding & metal traps.  These work....in time.  I'm far too impatient & frustated by seeing my yard destroyed while gophers out smart the above methods.  The Victor black box has been great!  I have a 100% kill rate for the last 2 weeks and generally get my gopher within 4 hrs of placing the trap.  Also, you can see if the trap has been tripped without disturbing the trap.  Unlike the metal jaw style trap, where I had to trip it when pulling it out of the hole (because most of the time I had nothing.)  I put a little bit of carrot in the bait hole in the back of the box & so far, I'm very happy.<br />This trap appears more humane in terms of a rapid kill (snaps the spine) & it less messy as the gopher doesn't have any wounds to deal with.  It's worth the money.  There is no way you are going to lose this thing underground either.

review/summary: Works GREAT - you HAVE TO follow the instructions - read on
review/text: Have had serious gopher problems for YEARS.  Most effective up to this point have been (for me) the "smoke bombs".  those cost about $7 for 4 of them, and for them to be successful I needed to locate about 10 or so holes, make sure they did follow a tunnel and them bomb them all at one time.  It was somewhat effective, and with no bodies to account for you never really knew.<br /><br />THESE TRAPS HOWEVER:  WORK GREAT<br /><br />Ive never liked traps because theyd say something like "find the main gopher tunnel, and then place it in there...etc"  And Id think "ya right, point ONE out to me and Id be GLAD to do just that..."<br /><br />Ive killed 4 gophers so far using these traps.  Two yesterday, and one so far today (=3 dead gophers) and one a couple days ago...<br /><br />What I have found effective SO FAR (still getting the "hang of it") is to EITHER:<br /><br />1) find an OPEN HOLE and use a stick and "TRY TO" determine which direction it leads, and THEN dig an opening in that direction about 1-2 feet AWAY from its opening large enough to put TWO of these traps inside it BACK TO BACK.  THEN (set the traps) put them inside, cover up ALL the holes so NO LIGHT PASSES INTO the tunnel.  And WAIT - come back in an hour Im sure MOST LIKELY you got one!  no kidding, see my uploaded pictures.<br /><br />Ive gotten 1 this way<br /><br />2) IF YOU FIND A HOLE THAT IS CLOSED / PLUGGED **AND** THE DIRT PLUGGING IT IS "POWDERY" (is literally the consistency of powder) THEN (most likely) a gopher is INSIDE THAT TUNNEL.<br /><br />In THIS SCENARIO put ONE TRAP facing INTO the tunnel, cover up all holes so NO LIGHT can enter.  Come back in about an hour, or the next day (for me 1 hour is suffice) AND *ALMOST CERTAIN* YOU CAUGHT ONE!  no kidding, Ive gotten 3 this way (1 yesterday, one today within 1 hour of setting this trap this way).<br /><br />ONE THING TO CONSIDER ALSO: THREE GOPHERS SO FAR were not dead when I pulled the traps out of the ground so I had to kill them myself... they were hurt but no way dead - all others were dead (fyi)<br /><br />AND A NICE POINT / IN ADDITION:<br /><br />IF you see the spring portion UP IN THE AIR when you approach your trap after youve set it in place, this means 100% you caught a gopher.  SPRINGS UP = CAUGHT GOPHER<br /><br />FINAL POINT / IN CONCLUSION:<br /><br />GREAT TRAPS! THEY WORK BY FAR THE BEST OUT OF ANYTHING IVE TRIED SO FAR... BY FAR<br /><br />GREAT GREAT TRAPS!<br /><br />remember find and ACTIVE HOLE, and set them in there using the methods above and YOU WILL kill gophers!<br /><br />GREAT TRAPS, wish I knew of them 15 years ago!<br /><br />I hope this review helps! I think these traps work GREAT<br /><br />**update**<br />killed 22 gophers so far (as of 06-29-12)<br />1 4-5-12 gopher leaving tunnel<br />2 4-8-12 (one of these was killed using 2 traps back to back when gopher was re-entering the hole, the other gopher leaving tunnel)<br />1 4-9-12 gopher leaving tunnel<br />1 4-10-12 gopher leaving tunnel<br />1 4-11-12 gopher leaving tunnel<br />2 4-12-12 gophers leaving (separate) tunnels<br />1 4-14-12 gopher leaving tunnel<br />2 4-21-12 gopher inside tunnel / leaving tunnel - one was caught in SAME TUNNEL as previous caught 4-12-12.  The second today was caught in a different area of the yard when my foot sank into the ground, I dug the area and found a large "fresh" looking tunnel - within 2 hours I checked back (daily routine) and caught a gopher - took pictures and uploaded them, set the trap and within 2 hours caught a gopher<br />1 4-25-12 gopher inside tunnel / leaving tunnel - one trap near opening, inside tunnel<br />1 4-28-12 gopher leaving tunnel<br />1 4-03-12 gopher leaving tunnel / 2nd kill SAME tunnel - took about 7-8 days, left trap in tunel, surprised to have caught another in the SAME tunnel (about 7-8 days later)<br />1 5-05-12 gopher leaving tunnel - saw a fresh / new hole back filled with LOOSE / POWDERY dirt, set trap, about 6 hours later (I check every couple-few hours regularly) CAUGHT GOPHER #15<br />1 5-6-12 (same tunnel / hole as #15... there was no other hole to set this trap in, so I reset it in the same hole<br />2 5-9-12 gopher within tunnel AND the second gopher THIS day was same tunnel as #15 and #16 (3rd gopher in SAME TUNNEL) 18 gophers so far<br />1 5-12-12 gopher inside tunnel - used two traps<br />1 5-18-12 GOPHER #20!!!  :-)  gopher inside tunnel... was walking and heel sank, dug into ground and found hole, set ONE TRAP, a few hours later was on the computer looked out window and saw the spring was up in the air (only means ONE thing) = caught gopher #20 - happy happy day (see uploaded pic)<br />1 6-3-12 gopher inside tunnel - was leaving tunnel - saw a new / fresh powdery dirt plugged hole and set trap - next day spring was up<br />1 6-29-12 OLD TUNNEL, two traps had been in their for a couple weeks and I never took them out, today ONE of the springs was up, caught another one a small one but a dead one (gopher #22)<br /><br />WHAT IVE LEARNED AFTER KILLING 22 GOPHERS:<br /><br />It *SEEMS* as if each gopher has its own set of tunnels which ARE NOT shared by other gophers... (W/ FEW Exceptions that is).  Gophers went unchecked / ignored and RUINED our entire yard, and front of house - HUGE "gulleys and VERY uneven ground is what remains, you walk around out there and sometimes your entire foot sinks to your ankle...<br /><br />After having caught a gopher in pretty much most of the tunneled areas, NONE have come back so far... SO FAR<br /><br />BUT:  IT DOES SEEM as if each gopher has its own tunnel system.  I have ONLY caught gophers in different tunnels areas, NEVER in the same tunnel system / area.<br /><br />It just seems this way, and like mentioned none have come back as of yet, and I am going to be digging into ALL tunnels and back filling them with dirt... of course THEN EVEN MORE SO a new opening / entrance will mean an active tunnel - this was how I caught my 9th gopher... it dug a hole and then back filled its opening, then later below it on a hill, it dug another and I could see its head shooting in and out throwing out dirt - I stood over witha shovel and made eye contact... I then came back in about 10 min and set a trap in the FIRST backfilled hole, about 45 min later I checked and the spring had popped up - caught that gopher #9<br /><br />ALSO - and END OF THIS POST (for now) - 8 of 9 gophers only ONE TRAP was used, saw a fresh hole which was plugged from the inside, which I also now know / feel means it is an active hole / tunnel - set ONE TRAP FOR WHEN IT LEFT - 8 out of 9 kills went THIS WAY<br /><br />I CAUGHT ONLY ONE GOPHER USING TWO TRAPS BACK TO BACK:  gopher hole was OPEN, I dug infront of it about 1-2 feet, set TWO traps and the gopher was caught on the way back in<br /><br />MY CONCLUSION:  if a hole is OPEN set two, and youll most likely catch it upon its re entrance<br /><br />If a hole looks fresh, and plugged, dig it open wide enough to set one trap, then WAIT, just go about your day, and come back later, almost certain you caught one if its an active hole<br /><br />"ACTIVE HOLE" = a hole that is OPEN or PLUGGED FROM THE INSIDE and the dirt that is plugging it is POWDERY *NOT* compacted like the desert ground all cracked looking, it will look like fresh dirt was used to plug it VERY RECENTLY meaning that SAME DAY<br /><br />take all of this info and use it, it worked for me!  8 out of 9 were killed using ONE TRAP when the gopher was LEAVING its tunnel - I literally destroyed its opening by digging it open with a shovel, the felt for a hole, found the tunnel using a stick made sure it went on for some ways, then I set a trap butted up against the opening that I widened - used some leaves to cover the holes in the set trap, sprinkled loose dirt lightly and MADE SURE NO LIGHT ENTERED FROM OUTSIDE INTO THE TUNNEL - then waited / went about my day - EVERY TIME SPRING WAS UP = caught gopher.  3 of 9 werent dead had to kill myself, but they were caught in the trap.  The sprung trap makes a very nice and ironically convenient handle to just grab and removed the whole thing from the ground with the butt of the gopher staring you in the face when you pull it up - you NEVER even have to touch the gopher, I never cleaned mine off, just reset the spring and reused the trap - if it was an "active hole" I caught another<br /><br />SIMPLE SIMPLE SIMPLE<br /><br />good luck!<br /><br />***ALSO see my uploaded pictures

review/summary: works great for Florida Pocket Gophers
review/text: My first suggestion is to make sure of what exact pest is digging up your yard. My husband and I had first thought these mounds or hills were made by moles, or maybe armadillos, and after research for local yard problems, found they were made by the Southeastern Pocket Gopher. We have the other 2 pests here too, but their habits are different, and we'll have to get something else for the moles.<br />We had tried everything to repel or remove this critter, and finally ordered one of these traps after reading good reviews here. To my great surprise, we got the pesky Pocket Gopher the very next morning after setting the trap. We did use the carrot trick at the back of the trap, as shown on the instructions.<br />So much damage was done to our yard and shrubs, and it appears it was just this one pocket gopher all along. But if another one moves in, we will be prepared with this Victor Black Box trap. Very satisfied customer!

review/summary: Gopher Getter
review/text: I remember my dad using a similar item (made of wood) years ago to keep our yard gopher free. The new generation Black Box is plastic, but works just as well. The snare is very strong and seems to do its job very quickly (at least none of the gophers have been alive when I've gotten to them). Once tripped, it requires a bit of muscle to release the spring and a little shaking to get the gopher out, but that's just a testament to its effectiveness. I hate to kill these little guys, but they're destroying my yard! The Black Box is a a definite Gopher Getter.

review/summary: Best Gopher Trap!  (When set properly)
review/text: This trap works the best, built very well and solid.  Just make sure you set the trap at the last or most recent gopher mound.  Once set, the gopher is usually trapped within the next 12 - 48 hours.  If it doesn't, then you probably didn't get the right gopher mound or the trap was not in the proper direction.  The trap with the little hole at the end, needs to be like an exit, as if the gopher was trying to push the dirt out to close the hole.  Once the gopher goes into the "Black Box" and tries to push dirt up into the little hole...  "SNAP!" the trap grabs the gopher and holds it in the trap.  Good luck!

So I've been trying to find the best trap for him to use. I came on Amazon to find some and just bought a bunch. One of them my father said worked relatively well was this one. It has a good design and an alright killing speed. Though he said the absolute best was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007O24US">Black Hole Rodent Trap</a>. He says it's definitely worth the extra dollars. He absolutely loves it.

review/summary: Very effective trap; caught one in less than 30 minutes
review/text: This year we have rodent problems, mice in our front lawn and a pocket gopher in our backyard.  The backyard is where we grow vegetables and it has become our pocket gopher's heaven!  The mouse traps are pretty effective in catching mice in the front lawn.  But for the resident in our backyard, we've been outsmarted in more ways than one.  The gopher came out to munch on my plants at night and each morning I found another dead plant.  We've tried everything under the sun including a professional exterminator but all to no avail.  I wanted to get the Black Hole traps or Macabee traps but they were not available in this part of Canada.  I was about to throw in the towel when I saw this BlackBox.  I was very skeptical at first but I really didn't have anything to lose so I decided to battle the gopher one last time.<br /><br />I got two traps in a local store yesterday then came here to read the reviews.  Thanks to those reviewers who shared their experience in such detail that I was pretty confident when it came to to setting up my trap.<br /><br />I found a new mound and a new hole in our vegetable garden this morning, blood went straight to my head and I began to dig down like MAD.  I found a one-way tunnel that came from outside our fence.  I set one single trap there, following the directions of a couple of reviewers here (big thanks).  I covered the trap with loose leafs and a bit of dirt then I went to plug the mouse holes in the front lawn.  When I was still plugging holes I heard a "thud" and my heart jumped!  It was not even 30 minutes after the trap was set, could that be??<br /><br />When I got to the trap I found the trigger lever up and something was struggling inside the housing!  I didn't want to pull it up immediately hoping the rodent would die in a few minutes.  Unfortunately the spring was not strong enough to kill the gopher at first snap.  To me, digging the tunnel was work, setting the trap was easy, but killing the gopher was difficult.  But I really had no choice.  If I let that thing go it would come back and tear up the rest of our garden.  So it got to die!<br /><br />The pocket gopher was not very big, about 6.5" in length tail not included.  It got tiny eyes and very long teeth and claws.  The gopher got cheek pouches to store food and there was still a bit of green left in one of its cheeks when it was killed.<br /><br />Since the tunnel came from outside our fence I reset the trap just in case someone else decides to move in.  Overall I am very happy with this trap.  The design is simple but this little trap performs better than those exterminators come with big price tags.<br /><br />My only complaint about this trap is the instruction, or the lack of it.  There is a  brief instruction printed on the box without details.  If Victor could provide one single sheet with printed diagrams to go with written instructions that would be nice.<br /><br />This trap is pretty safe to use and there's very little chance to catch a finger inside the housing.  However, once the trap is set you must be very careful when moving it around. One of my traps is more sensitive than the other. The first time I set up the sensitive trap and tried to move it inside the tunnel, I was not paying attention and the spring was trigger.  The metal lever sprang up and hit my ring finger! Fortunately nothing was broken, just a big bruise.  I have uploaded a few pictures of the captured gopher.  Revenge is sweet!<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this product.  This trap definitely deserves 4.5 stars!

review/summary: Finally, A GOPHER BE GONE!
review/text: For over 20 years we have tried traps and at first when we moved out here we were new to these things and I tried running water to drown them. (LOL) Well, we all know that is just costly at the end of the month. Then I ran across a person on here 88Ronin who had detailed, step by step instructions on how to do it and he had me convinced that even I could do it. I was petrified to set the trap and asked him questions, (several) and he walked me through it. I have successfully caught 5 gophers within 2 weeks. I had to get my husband to remove the carcass. I bought poison too, but I have four dogs and one of them likes to hunt the gophers, so I was a little worried about poisoning my own pets. And this is way less inhumane. AND It is quick. So all of you that are against killing these over-sized rats, they are not only pests, they make huge holes in your yards, land, and garden. So if you have horses, animals, or kids that like to run and play, get ready to either shoot them or take them to a ER. Their legs to go through the holes and they will snap. They also tear up your lawn, and eats up your food in the garden.<br />I can tell you what I did. Found the freshest hole and I ran water to get the hole opened. I peeled back our grass to make the hole bigger and placed the black box down inside and sprinkled dirt back on top of it and left just the little hole at the end open. They will come through to start covering that hole up. But, I suggest you to look up the reviews on here and find 88ronin's review. He has a detailed excellent way to get'em. I wouldn't have got even one without his help.<br />Goodluck

review/summary: Death Comes Quickly to the Pesky Gopher.
review/text: This gopher trap was effective.  I placed this in a tunnel the day I received it and when I checked the tunnel 24 hours later the gopher was dead in the trap.  You will need to do some personal preparation before you place the trap. I first watched some videos on youtube on how to find gopher tunnels and then how to place the trap and then made sure I knew where the gopher tunnels were at.<br /><br />To find the great videos by UC San Diego on how to do this, go to youtube and search "pocket gophers finding tunnel systems".  It should be the first video.  Watch the other video they have on how to place a trap. Once you've done this you are ready to go kill the gopher.  While others have said to handle it with gloves, I did not and the trap was quite effective anyways.<br /><br />One warning, when using a trap you need to know that the death of the gopher is not sugar coated as with poisons.  You will see the dead gopher up close and personal and will have to release the trap to get the gopher out of it.<br /><br />However, if your goal is to get rid of a gopher as soon as possible, you can't go wrong with this trap.

review/summary: Black Box Gopher Trap
review/text: We live in the country where there are a LOT of gophers, moles, voles, etc. I have tried several gopher traps and had a success rate of about 1 in 5 settings.....and with a lot of work trying to fool the critters. But, the Black Box caught 2 of my problem gophers (they were killing our trees) in 3 settings. And I didn't have to try to fool the trap shy beasts. The Black Box gopher trap is a fantastic tool for getting rid og gophers.

review/summary: AMAZING!
review/text: Yeah, this gopher trap is pretty amazing!<br /><br />I have a terrible gopher infestation and I had been using the wire Macabee style traps for about two months. I had been using the Macabee traps exactly as instructed but the success rate was very low with them. If I was lucky, I might catch one or two gophers a week.<br /><br />I would spend a ridiculous amount of time every day setting up the Macabee traps just to find them buried by gophers the next day. It is incredibly frustrating because you can't just look at a Macabee trap to see if it has been sprung. You have to completely pull them up and check everything and then reset everything all over again.<br /><br />With the blackbox I've had a 100% success rate so far! I've caught a gopher every single day for the past four days and I suspect that I'll keep up this pace until I've decimated the gopher population for my entire neighborhood!<br /><br />This trap is WAY BETTER than the Macabee style traps. The Macabee traps say "easy set" on them. HA! What a joke! The black box is much easier to set and is much more powerful so it kills more humanely. I've had Macabee traps complete eviscerate gophers but somehow leave them alive to die painfully. I've had nothing but quick and clean kills with this blackbox.<br /><br />It is also much easier to "release" the dead gopher from the blackbox than with the macabee traps since the blackbox always leaves the rodent in one piece.<br /><br />Oh and my favorite part of the blackbox is that you can actually walk right up to it and look at it to see if it has been sprung, unlike the macabee traps which requires them to be pulled out to check on them.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br />On Day 5 of owning this trap, I killed 4 gophers in a single day with a single trap!

review/summary: Gopher Coffin
review/text: These traps are the best.  I used to have a wooden one but kept losing the trigger wire.  When I did use it I used it in combination with one of the little metal spring traps (putting one each direction in the runway).  This was a successful means of killing gophers until one day the metal trap disappeared into the ground and I never have found it.  I even had it tethered to a stake.  This was one tough gopher.  The nice thing about the box trap is that it stops them cold and they don't move after it is triggered.  They are toast.<br /><br />I purchased two of these Victor 0625 Blackbox Gopher Traps.  They are very durable, made of very heavy, dense plastic plastic.  I put one in each direction in the runway and catch them every time.<br /><br />This is a very effective gopher trap and I highly recommend it.

review/text: My boyfriend set up the traps in the backyard, two traps back to back (like the box recommends), and we caught one 3 hours later. He said the gopher didn't look very happy when he took care of the trap, so these are probably not what you are looking for if that bothers you. I let him do it, and try not to think about it too much.<br /><br />They work though!

review/summary: Finally!!!!! it's dead!
review/text: It was a LONG battle with gophers in our backyard.<br />Trust me I'm all for repellents and humane methods of prevention. But just as one reviewer said, you'll end up with "big fat organically fed gophers". If you have gophers it's a WAR, and don't take hostages, you want them dead!<br />1. We'd tried spinners(the guy in the nursery had sworn by it) but as my husband said "the only way this might work is if gophers die of laughter". Well, they didn't die or left the yard but I'm sure they laughed at us, because we would find two new mounds every morning. At least kids enjoy having noisy spinners in the yard:)).<br />2. Step two was "The Giant Destroyer Gas Bomb" which seemed to work for a few days. Then we would find another mound, not so big though! We tried to smoke them again, making sure we put a bomb in each hole in the ground we could find. Then quiet for a few days, yet again a tiny mound appeared one morning. That was it.<br />3. My husband put this trap in the ground and.... the very next morning I was happy as any predator can be. I didn't know I'd be so excited to see a dead creature.  At the same time I was happy I didn't have to deal with the trap and dead gopher, my husband disposed it. Hopefully it was the only one that was left. We'll keep the trap for a couple of days, to make sure nobody comes back.<br />Some details on how we set the trap. I thought it wouldn't be trivial but to my surprise it was.<br />If you have a mound on your lawn, using a flat spade cut out a square peace of the  grass with roots about 6 inches deep and a bit over 1 sq.foot right where the mound is. You'll see a little tunnel, set the trap in the tunnel and cover with the grass. Check it daily.<br />Good luck!<br />Usually I'm a very peaceful person but when your garden is being destroyed right in front of you..., sorry, no mercy:  !

review/text: I'm not agriculturally proficient at all, and rather not deal w/ dead critters. But I just couldn't stand the backyard full of gopher hills, and wanted to give this a try. I've been flooding the holes, and noticed one hole that kept on getting filled back up every day or so. So I set the trap (i still wasn't sure it I followed the directions or not), and the next morning... Let's just say that I haven't seen any new hole for the past week or so. This one really works well, just follow one of the reviewers directions, and you'll get you yard and sanity back in no time.

review/summary: These traps work better than expected
review/text: After reading other articles on gardening forums regarding the difficulty of getting rod of gophers I was not sure of how effective these traps would be. I learned of them through a gardening forum post.  I thought I'd give them a try.  I nailed three gophers out of 4 trap sets in my first two days! Using only two traps. The only trap set that did not catch was set back in the same hole as the first catch. Package instructions say to try placing back in the same hole as a kill for up to 3 more days to catch others.  I have so many mounds I'm just moving to fresh ones each day. Low-hanging fruit, so to speak. The traps are very sturdy and well made, and I like the very quick kill.  I'm not interested in poisoning animals or slow kills.  These work so well I am buying 2 more for a total of 4.  I have 2 acres which are gopher ridden.  Soon they will be rid. Highly recommended!

review/summary: the ONLY thing that has worked fo rme
review/text: I had just moved into my new home, only to find that there were some pests waiting for me. Within a couple of weeks the new lawn was being dug up like crazy by moles.  Like most people, I went the non-lethal route of sonic spikes, pellets that are supposed to make the dirt smell/taste bad, etc etc.<br /><br />After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to give it a try and purchased 2 - one for the front yard and one for the back.  Within a day, I had already caught the first mole in the back.  Thankfully, it appears that was the only one.<br /><br />In the front yard, it took a little more effort. The mole would keep pushing dirt into the trap and setting it off. Based upon a recommendation from a friend, I smeared some almond butter (any nut butter would work) on the inside of the back of the trap.  The next morning, the only thing the trap was filled with was dead mole.<br /><br />I highly highly recommend these traps. They are literally the ONLY thing that has caught and killed the pests. Don't waste your money on other traps or oils or pellets or spikes.

review/summary: It works!
review/text: I've tried gopher gas bombs and water hose down the hole (neither worked).  I just used the Black Box for the past 24 hours and I've killed 3 gophers so far.  I found the most recently dug holes, dug it out a bit more so I can place the black box into the hole.  Make the box flush and semi-level with the tunnel so it seems like it's a part of the gopher tunnel, then place soft dirt around the edges so the main light is peaking thru the hole in the box.  I placed baby carrots near the hole in the box to entice the gophers to move fully into the box.  This contraption isn't for the squeamish.  You'll have to handle the box with the dead gopher, but if you press the metal handle back down the gopher falls out.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a gopher problem.

review/summary: Didn't work for me - useless instructions
review/text: I live in southern california and my yard is over-run by gophers. I bought this trap first from amazon as it supposedly is meant for novice users who are just beginning their gopher-eradication journey.<br /><br />The trap arrived in a paper box, which had pretty much no useful instruction in placing the trap. Should you place one trap in each direction of the tunnel? Should you cover up the end hole? the top opening? Should you place bait? Should you wear gloves? Should the joint of the trap and the tunnel be air tight? Should you use it in the main run? Or can it be used in the lateral openings? No help on any of these items in the instructions.<br /><br />Anyway, I set the trap 3 times, and each time the little critters filled them up with dirt. I finally got fed up and bought a couple of the victor easy-set traps. With those, I have had good success after placing them in the tunnels. This one is a waste. I don't know how it got such high reviews.

review/summary: KINDA SMALL TRAP- APPROX 3.5 or 4 opening X 7 inches long
review/text: This trap is made for "minnie mole", or "Geo the gopher". You know the tiny chevrolet Geo?<br />Honestly, don't think it will work for me 'cause I actually saw the one that has taken up residence in my front, and back yard, and he aint that small. I should refer to him as a ground hog instead :) Maybe this trap will catch something roaming around, that doesn't belong.... If it does catch gargantuan gopher I'll report back.<br /><br />Sorry to say the lever let me down. The lever on the trap has to be set on the edge of the hook for it to work. I even decided to dig the trap up, because I noticed that overnight, still had no catch, but the bait was gone. I wiggled the hook, this thing did not even budge. So I am assuming that the hook on my trap is bent too far closed. Washed it, and disinfected it, and sent it back. I am trying the huge rat trap with bait, then I'll report back with my results.

review/summary: Mixed feeling, effective but not as easy as people describe
review/text: I really don't like how everyone makes it seem so easy to use.  This box is large.  You have to dig a sizeable portion of dirt to make a flat area that fits the whole box.  Due to this, you are going from a small tunnel size hole to a giant hole.  It takes practice to carefully flush the front of the box to the hole and then gently pack dirt in the gaps to close the light.  Even when I thought it was perfect, I had gophers pack them a few times even when a carrot piece was in the back.  I have been using them for a few weeks and got 2 gophers and 1 mole.  With each kill, they are definitely dead so I didn't have to worry about one squirming.  Also, finding the hole and ensuring the gopher has easy access into the box is not easy!  The tunnels are at angles or are not clearly defined even with using a long stick or some type of rod to probe around.  The boxes do work but don't expect this to be a cake walk.  It takes around 10-15 minutes to find the tunnel, dig the hole and put the trap in while wearing some type of gloves.  Also, if you have dogs, good luck trying to keep them away.  I have to cover the holes with stepping stones to avoid my dogs digging down while still allowing light to get in so the gopher sees the light in the back of the box.  I have a terrier that wants to find out what is going on all the time.

review/text: Watching helplessly as our backyard lawn being decimated by gophers, I googled for video tutorials on how to set gopher traps.<br />Most seemed to me complicated and even overwhelming. I am an engineer, and you heard the joke on how many engineers it takes to change the - you know...<br />Using poison was not an option because of nearby vegetable patch.<br />But, one day, looking at our lawn in sorry state, I knew that the gophers left me no choice. It was time to shop for the very first gopher trap in my life.<br />I picked Victor Blackbox, not because I knew anything about it, but the reviews were favorable.<br />The order was delivered, and I opened it up.<br />It had a small piece of paper purported to be an instruction manual, which did not make sense to the novice of novices.<br />I visited their website, but there was really not much info there either.<br />Why not just 2 minute YouTube video on how to use it...<br />My problem was that I could not make which way to place the trap in gopher's tunnel because one end was closed. Of course, I now know with my newly gained skill having caught 5 gophers so far how to dig and expose the tunnel and place the trap in which direction.  But, it was just all unexplained and was indeed a blackbox to me.<br />Anyhow, I managed to set the trap after learning how to do it from Amazon's product review(!) and within a few days, I caught 5 gophers.<br />I like Victor Blackbox because it is designed with safety in mind for users, and reusable again and again.<br />It works each time, and because of strong and quick snap, it is humane kill for the rodent.<br />I highly recommend it - if I can handle it, you will be able to.<br />Lastly, I hope the manufacturer puts up a 2 minute instruction on  YouTube.

The fastest kill was under 5 mins.  Barely had my tools put away before the trap was sprung.  This trap is based on the behavior of the gopher.  When properly set as the other reviewers have described, the fresh air and light that comes in the little hole at the end of the box triggers the gophers natural behavior.  They have a keen sense of smell and the smell the fresh air and sense the light coming into the tunnel triggers the gopher into action.  The gopher simply feels compelled to fix the situation and seal off the tunnel.  Next thing you know the gopher is pushing a dirt plug to close the hole.  The box is large and deep enough to let both the dirt plug and the gopher to enter the trap before the trigger is sprung.  There you have it - 1 dead gopher.  I have tried everything over the years and now would not recommend anything else but this trap.

review/summary: Unfortunately it works
review/text: Well, this trap is extremely effective. I bought 2 and set them up back to back, as is recommended. I also found some videos on YouTube that helped me find their many tunnels, I believe I searched  for "gopher tunnel system" and it was a UC Davis video. In addition I bought the gopher probe on Amazon. It is designed to apply poison, which I don't do, but it makes the tunnel finding task so much easier.<br /><br /> First day I caught the real trouble maker who was literally destroying my lawn and inflicting major damage on my beds, too. Since then activity has been minor, and when I see a new mound I immediately set the traps up and the problem is taken care of, sometimes within an hour or two. My yard is on the mend, I wish I hadn't waited so long to start using these.<br /><br />So, what's the "unfortunate" part? For me, it is hard to remove the gophers. Not physically, but emotionally. They are actually really cute. I really would have preferred a non lethal solution, but in my experience there are NONE that work. I spend 15-20 hours a week working in my garden, and hundreds if not thousands of dollars, I just couldn't bear to see it destroyed.

review/summary: Seriously Good Product
review/text: This is a seriously good product.  I live in a very rural area which is plagued by moles and pocket gophers. This year has been especially bad, as evidenced by literally hundreds of fresh soil mounds each week in my pasture and garden.  Like other reviewers, I tried a number of other products in an attempt to avoid the dreaded trap.  And nothing worked.  The gassers were useless, and although the poison was effective, I worried constantly about my dog and (for those who think poison is a nice and tidy solution), encountered trails of bloody mucus and entrails on my concrete walkways as evidence of what must have been a prolonged and horrific death.<br /><br />Enter the Black Box.  First, I want to make the point that I'm a woman, a bit squeamish (actually, a lot squeamish when it comes to things rodent), and I have no mechanical aptitude at all.  I was absolutely sure that I was not going to be able to set the trap (or that I would lose a few fingers trying) and was similarly certain that I would not catch anything.  Stuff like this just doesn't work for me.<br /><br />Well, to my amazement, I had an instant success.  It couldn't have been more than three or four hours after I (successfully) set the trap that I had snagged my first mole.  And I have been trapping them daily every since.<br /><br />Let me begin by stating that there is nothing at all difficult about setting this trap.  It sets just like a mouse trap, but with two important exceptions:  First, the metal arm that holds the spring-loaded killing bar down is very easy to set in place and, unlike a mouse trap, does not tend to spring loose while you're setting it.  Second, the killing bar is INSIDE the box, so even if the bar were to snap back while you're setting the trap, your fingers would not be in harm's way.  Yes, it takes considerably more muscle to set than a mousetrap, but it is nothing that this 120-pound woman can't easily do.  I use one foot to help, and I can set the thing in a matter of seconds.  No sweat.<br /><br />Finding the tunnel and placing the trap has been a no-brainer.  I simply dig a hole where the mound is, then feel around its sides with a gloved hand to locate the tunnel opening.  Once located, I scoop out the loose dirt to clear a good-sized opening, then butt the trap right up against the tunnel opening.  Other reviewers have stated that they pack dirt tightly around the sides of the trap, but I've had equally good luck simply setting the trap in the hole and covering the hole with a piece of heavy cardboard (making sure that no light comes through around the edges).  Normally, within a half-day I have either caught something or the trap has been packed with dirt by a mole or gopher trying to close off the tunnel.  In the latter event, I simply reset the trap and try again.  Baby carrots stuck part-way into the air hole do seem to improve the chances of success.<br /><br />Disposal of dead catch has not been all that bad.  I dig a grave, and, using the toe of my boot to hold the bar down, simply knock the dead critter into the hole with a trowel.  Don't have to touch anything.<br /><br />In summary, this product really works.  The only criticism I have is that the instructions on the box are not at all helpful.  However, by reading the reviews on Amazon, a first-time user can get a complete how-to and be up and running in minutes.  The poor instructions notwithstanding, I give this product five stars.

review/summary: Great for murdering gophers
review/text: I bought this contraption after a savage group of gophers was ravaging both my front and back yards.  I caught two gophers in about a week.  It is kind of a pain to dig and set it in the ground but it certanly works.  I did not use any bait. There are good videos on youtube on how to set this kind of trap.

review/summary: Awesome trap
review/text: I tried poison, hose down the hole, gassing...all of which gave no dead body in return, and mounds kept showing up regularly.  So after some research and a word of advice from a friend, I found these traps.  I read the reviews and ordered two.<br /><br />I set one on early Friday morning in my front yard, following the instructions given by one of the posts.  Woke up this morning, checked it, and caught that sucker.  I checked the backyard after feeling victorious and noticed a fresh mound.  So, feeling confident, I dug around a bit, found the tunnel, set the second trap. Caught the second one within an hour.  I live in regular ole suburbia with a normal size front & backyard. So these can work just fine without tearing up your grass too bad.<br /><br />These traps are fantastic.  HIGHLY recommended.

review/summary: Works great if you like death (to gophers)!
review/text: I use this one and the black hole trap. They both work well and I think it is good to switch off. One old geezer had packed two of my black hole traps with dirt so I switched off to this one and caught the old guy, a big, wise old grandpa type. Great big teeth and claws, been around a while. Kindof sad but it's them or my manzanita.<br /><br />The killing never ends. I clear em out but they come back in waves and I have to put the traps out again, sometimes I get them before they damage a plant, sometimes I am too late. Someone told me to plant garlic around, I don't think it is a CA native like the rest of my garden but I will give it a try, I hate so much killing. I think their tunnels extend under the asphalt road to the park across the street. They even come in the house sometimes, waddling across the Pergo looking for a tunnel...

review/summary: It works, got gopher #1 on Day 2
review/text: Bought two traps to set in various pocket gopher holes. I found the holes by poking around the mounds with a bbq skewer until it was met with little resistance, then opened the hole with a shovel and my hand (wearing garden gloves). On Day 1, the gopher(s) plugged the two traps 2-3 times, so I moved the traps to other parts of their maze. Sure enough, got one this morning. And to my surprise, the other trap was not plugged and the open holes where the traps had been set previously were not plugged either. I wonder if it was just the one gopher? Either way, I reset the traps and will wait a few days. If the traps and open holes aren't plugged over the next few days, I'd say I'm good.<br /><br />Needless to say, these things do work. Just be sure to block out all light, except the small hole on the end. And set the traps in a different place if the gophers keep plugging the traps.

review/summary: Excellent after adjustment
review/text: My first Black Box worked very well, so I bought three more. Some of the new ones didn't work; the gophers filled them with dirt without springing them. I tested the triggers with a postal scale and found that the good traps would trigger with less than two ounces of force, while the bad ones took up to six ounces. I bent the hooks on the trigger wires (the wire the gopher pushes) until I got them all to trigger at under two ounces. I also filed some down a little. Now they all work very well. I am catching a couple of dozen gophers a year. These traps don't work on the moles in my area, because the moles go under them instead of entering. The traps are durable. The wire is either stainless or some rust resistant alloy. As others have said, you have to dig a significant hole to set these. If you are trying not to disturb a lawn, it is best to dig out chunks of sod and keep them cool and damp until the gopher is caught. Then you can replace the chunks in the hole.

review/summary: gophers' bane
review/text: If you have pocket gopher problem, get this trap.  Set it up correctly and you will catch your enemy.<br /><br />I was so frustrated with my big-box-store-bought "wire jaw" type of traps.  For<br />three days straight, those traps were tripped and buried by the pesky gopher without catching it.  Everyday I woke up in the morning and only to see the holes<br />got plugged up.  Talking about feeling helpless...<br /><br />Then I found this wonderful device.  That smart gopher is now a dead gopher overnight.  Looking at its dead body in the trap this morning, I felt like at the top of the world...maybe a little exaggeration but I did smack the corpse with my<br />shovel to let out some last bit of hatred toward this pest.<br /><br />Get it now if you have gopher problem!  It's THE gophers' bane.

review/summary: Great Trap
review/text: I purchased this trap 2 months ago after my old wooden trap had caught its last gopher. With all the construction going on in the field behind my house, it was driving the gophers out and into mine and the surrounding yards. Well, no worries. So far five for five on traps set and gophers caught! Heck, I may even hire myself out to the neighbors! GREAT TRAP

review/summary: Worked brilliantly.
review/text: This is the first encounter I've had with gophers, let alone gopher traps. When I received the BlackBox, I took a couple of minutes to figure out how to set it, but it was very easy once I figured it out. Smaller, than I thought (turns out, gophers are smaller than I thought as well). I dug up the freshest hole, revealing the pests tunnel, as the instructions described on the box. I placed a single box inside the ground, put a carrot through the vent hole and set the trap.<br /><br />No telling when it was caught, but I let the trap sit overnight and when I came back in the morning to investigate, the box was tripped, and the gopher was dead inside. Clean, kill, not messy. As humane as you can be, killing an animal. Not something I wanted to do, but can't have the little bugger wrecking my yard. Set it again this morning, just to be certain there are no more. However, if there are, I trust BlackBox to catch them.<br /><br />Very pleased with the product. Well worth the low price. I would recommend it, for the sake of your lawn.

review/summary: This thing really, really works!
review/text: I want to express my profound thanks to the many Amazon reviewers who helped me find and decide to purchase this product.  The positive reviews are stunningly correct.  I'm a life-long city dweller, recently moved to an area that borders on wide open spaces.  When the gophers invaded the yard, I went to the big-box home store, bought the usual poison granules, smoke firecrackers, etc.  with no luck.  Enter the Victor BlackBox trap.  I'd never seen one of these things, let alone used one, and the instructions on the box were minimal.  No problem!  I studied the excellent detailed information provided by Amazon reviewers.  Thanks again.  I did what they said, setting the trap under a fresh dig the same day it arrived.  Next morning -- a small funeral for one dead gopher.  Enough said.<br /><br />Addendum:  I've had my traps for several months now (I bought 2).  They continue to amaze.  As of today, I've dispatched six gophers.  Whenever I see a new dig in the yard, I grab my trusty Victor BlackBox traps and go to work.  They just get the job done.  I can't remember being this satisfied with another garden product.  Thank you Victor!

review/text: I read the reviews.  I wanted a solution that did not use poison due to our pets.  I bought two.  The directions say to place two of them back to back in the trench.  I am glad I followed directions. Berfore sundown, I placed both in the trench I dig out in the gopher path under a very thin layer of dirt, and waited.<br />Four hours later, the first one was packed full of dirt by the gopher.  The second one was tripped. I found large gopher.  See my photo.  It barely fit into the trap.  Note the first trap still hidden in the trench to the upper right.<br />No blood or mess.  I could not be happier.

review/text: At first I thought I was doing something wrong.  It took about two months before I got my gopher.  I would give this item 4 stars but the instructions on usage are very sparse and caused me to do a lot of trial and error before I finally got him.  However, the trap worked well and I can reuse it now.  Reset it and forget it so I would recommend it.

review/text: Tried poison bait for a few weeks, no dice, even when I used a screw driver to poke it into their main tunnels from above.<br /><br />Tried the victor blackbox and caught a gopher in about 30 minutes.<br /><br />Pretty easy to use too - all the killing bits are inside the box so it's 100% safe to handle. Digging the hole took a few minutes, but the results were worth it! No blood an guts to clean up either, at least on my first time around.<br /><br />It's made of plastic, but feels very heavy duty.

review/summary: Death from below...
review/text: I hate gopher.  My front yard is infested with these critters.  Pincer traps are good, but quite difficult to set if the hole is too wide.  These beautiful toys fit the bigger tunnel very nicely.<br /><br />I disagree with the other reviewer regarding to the trigger position.  With the factory set position, the bigger gopher will be choked, while the little one will be crushed at the mid section.  The key to successfully use this trap is how to set it.  You have to think like a gopher, and construct this unit into the gopher's existing tunnel.  Then, leave a little opening a bit further down the tunnel.  Gophers' instinct will be to close the opening further down the tunnel, thus activate the trigger.  I have caught gophers 3 hours after the traps were set.  2 from 1 trap in the same day.<br /><br />If you are afraid to dig a big hole in your yard, this is not a unit for you as it requires some space to construct an elaborate trap.  However, if the gopher is already destroying your yard, why not just do it yourself and rid of the problem once and for all.

review/text: This trap worked for me.  A major feature of the trap is that it is enclosed, so as long as you don't put your hands inside the enclosed area, it shouldn't bite you.  When setting, I added a carrot as a little incentive for the gopher to check things out.  Box recommends that you have 2 -- I think this is because you can put the opening in either direction to get them running both ways.  Also -- make sure you see Caddy Shack again before use.

review/summary: Worked in less than 24hrs!
review/text: Once you learn the correct way to set this trap it works! The first time I set this trap I had it turned the wrong way in the gopher hole (it was a large hole with multiple entrances). The gopher stuffed it full of dirt. After seeing this, I turned the trap so the opening faced a different tunnel. I also made sure I covered the hole and area around trap so no light or air would get into the gopher hole. I was careful about not putting too much dirt on the trigger mechanism. I also put baby carrots and peanut butter in the back of the trap. In less than 24hrs (I set it at night and rechecked in the morning) I had 1 of the critters that has been destroying my yard for the last several months. This trap works well if you take your time setting it up. You need to find a fresh hole and make sure this trap is flush with the gopher tunnel. You do have to dig a bit in your yard as this larger then some of the other traps on the market.  Also, a word of advice, make sure you know the critter type you are trying to trap. At first, I thought I had moles because I had piles of large dirt mound around my yard and the holes under the mounds were plugged. From what I read I thought it was a mole but I received some good local advice and they said I had gophers. Don't buy into the horseshoe shaped mounds theories about gopher holes. None of mine were horseshoe shaped and I caught a gopher. Hope this helps!

review/summary: The only one that has worked!
review/text: This is the only trap that has worked WELL in our yard in our battle with gophers. I didn't want to use poison because of the environment and potential danger to predator birds, so we started using at the recommendation of a friend who claimed "The Black Box is the ONLY thing that really works".<br /><br />We tried something called "The Black Hole" which definitely was not as effective and it may be because the animal has to walk on plastic, or that it actually has to fit into the round contraption, whatever - it definitely wasn't as effective as "The Black Box". I believe The Black Box works the best because the animal is "still feels dirt under its feet and is not alerted.  We simply place a fresh carrot piece in the back of the trap and it seems very effective as bait. As an animal lover, I was also concerned about being humane and this trap I believe kills instantly by snapping the spine so there is no suffering. Removal of the carcass is also simple and not messy (no blood).<br /><br />At times the gophers may fill the trap with dirt and it has been our experience that the trap sometimes needs to be set elsewhere in the tunnel system, BUT sometimes they can be "enticed" by placing a smaller carrot morsel or two further into the hole and "lead into the trap". We think they bury the trap because they are just plugging the hole, they don't even realize the food is available.<br /><br />I'm ordering more as it seems that it is the season for them and they have been popping up in different places on our property.

review/summary: Did not work for my gopher
review/text: This is the first set of traps I used for my gopher problem in my yard.  It came with instructions on only how to set the trap, not where to place it in regards to the gopher hole/runway.  After researching how to set box-style traps, I tried for a week in various locations throughout my yard where there was recent activity.  The problem wasn't finding the gopher, but it was that the gopher would push dirt into the trap and not set it off.  He was essentially pushing about three inches of dirt into the trap and sealing off himself from the plastic intrusion. The lever to set off the trap is even further back from that, so he never got far enough in the trap to do what it's supposed to do.  I finally purchased a two-pack of Victor Easy Set metal traps, and caught the sunofagun on the first setting of the traps.  Other people have had success with this type of trap, but not me. Hope this helps people in the future.

review/text: Got this to get rid of a family of gophers that was tearing up my yard. We tried everything, but nothing worked, even our dog seemed to be getting exasperated. The trap arrived the next day (thanks Amazon Prime!) and caught 3 of those annoying gophers in 4 days! I'm going to leave it out a few more days to make sure, but I dare say this trap cleaned house! Don't waste your time and money, and risk your health on poisons and other methods that claim to work. Buy one, you won't regret it. Think of it as an investment for your home!

review/summary: Finally Got Them
review/text: We just got a new house last year. It came complete with a large yard and pocket gophers. I spent 9 months trying different poisons always following the instructions. All it did was make them stronger as I saw more and more of my yard destroyed. Based on reviews and research, I chose the Blackbox trap. It came quickly and I read the directions and suggestions of other reviewers. I did not get a chance to set it for a couple of weeks, but I set it out about noon and came back a couple hours later and found the trap had sprung. I had seen some birds in the area and thought they might have tripped it. Nope, I had caught my first gopher. A big fat one. I dumped it and reset the trap, leaving it there for 3 days. No hits, but no more mounds in that area. I reset it in another area and within a couple of hours, bam another one. This trap works well and is worth the effort.<br /><br />Suggestions: Follow the directions. I picked mounds at the end of the tunnel with only one way out by using a metal rod to probe the ground. I dug out a lot of dirt to get the trap to match the hole properly. I used baby carrots as bait and carefully used dirt clods over the top hole and rear air hole to allow air flow but block light. Make sure you cover what you can to block the light. I have not washed the trap yet as there is not mess and it doesn't seem to prevent their buddies from joining them.

review/summary: Worked Quickly
review/text: I set the Victor version of the Macabee traps in opposite directions in a burrow.  I found one of the traps triggered, buried in dirt, but no gopher.  After four days of the same thing happening, I tried this box trap and got him.  However, it trapped the back end of the gopher and didn't kill it.

review/summary: Works great with a little creativity
review/text: My father is a bail bondsman with a lot of free time so he chooses to work in the yards of our roughly one acre of land. We have always had gophers around and my father has tried countless ways to get rid of them and never had much luck until a friend lent him a wooden version of this product. The friend's suggestion was to dig a small hole where the gopher's tunnel is, place the trap inside, cover the top with a leaf, and check back in a few hours. It worked so well that my father had to have a couple more. I found this one here on Amazon and ordered two. Thanks to Amazon Prime it was at my door in two days and within a week my father had captured four gophers and we noticed the lack of gopher activity for a few days. He has been giving them to good friends and we keep ordering more since more gophers show up every once in a while. The other day I visited a friend's house and noticed that he had 4 of these in his back yard and he mentioned that he spends a little more buying them locally but to him they're definitely worth the price. He puts a potato at the end to attract the gopher, so there are probably plenty of clever ways to trap those pesky gophers, it just takes some effort. I can say with certainty that this is an excellent product based on my father's and friends' successes.

review/summary: Winning at the Gopher Game - Gotcha!
review/text: Such satisfaction to win over these critters that have destroyed my previous yard and now the freshly layed sod after just spending $3000+ refreshing.  I caught one within minutes, yes minutes, thanks to the other generous reviews, directions and aid in finding videos to help in the setting of the trap.  Ahh, now I can sit back and know the next mound of freshly churned soil will be mine for the attack.  Gophers watch out, here I come with my Victor BlackBox Gopher Trap --- Ha, Ha --- Gotcha!

review/summary: Killed 2 moles  - N. California
review/text: Although described as a gopher trap, I have killed 2 moles in my yard with the black box.  It doesn't involve any chemicals or pesticides, is sturdy and can be re-used year to year, a great product.<br /><br />It takes a little learning and patience.  I tried 2 end-to-end but ultimately both my kills involved a single box at the end of a tunnel. Watch where they mound frequently and set it in that spot.  Take the time to dig out a hole with a flat compacted bottom, big enough for the black box.  Cover the holes at the top of the box with patties of damp soil so light will not enter.  Good luck!

review/summary: Good product
review/text: The Victor Black Box gopher trap worked for me the first day I used it. I tried other methods without success- the Victor Out-of-sight Trap was a total bust, and, yes, I followed the many directions for its use. I thoroughly and heartily recommend the awesome Black Box!
