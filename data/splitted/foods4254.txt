review/summary: Blech!!
review/text: Oh sweet mother...this is the worst tasting low-carb bread I've ever tried!!  This reminds me of the nasty low-carb bread they made way back in the day when they didn't know how to make it GOOD yet! I tried making LC versions of french toast, toast with jelly, and a breakfast sandwich with bacon, egg, and cheese..but the nasty taste of the bread just overpowered everything.  It's like eating rubber.  I'm going back to what I was using before which is Julian's Bakery low carb bread.  I get it at a health food store here.  It's definitely more caloric and it has 1 net carb per slice(the cinnamon has 2)..but is so delicious!!!  Please take me back Julian's Bakery...I'm sorry I cheated on you! lol

review/summary: I tried it regardless of reviews
review/text: I saw all the negative reviews but decided to try this bread anyway.  When you first get it, it looks great.  It's soft and smells good.  It behaves as slightly thicker white bread.  However, once you go to eat it, the problems begin.  It absorbs all moisture in your mouth and is so tough that it's like eating meat.  You can hardly tear the crust with your teeth, and then you end up with what feels like a sponge in your mouth.  It takes forever to chew it, the whole time it's tasting worse and worse.  When you finally swallow it, it's like you ate a cue ball.  I had to drink water while chewing multiple times just to keep from choking.<br />I would definitely not recommend this bread, and instead would recommend one of the Health Express breads.  I got both on the same shipment and it was definitely the winner compared to this bread.

review/summary: I love this bread!
review/text: Toasted, the flavor is terrific!  I store mine in the freeze, and just pop out a slice or two whenever I need it.  There's a lot of fiber in the bread, which may make it seem dry.  In fact, it just makes you take a little more time eating it -- and it fills you up!  I've been making my own low carb bread, but it's never turned out like this.  I've missed toast SO much since going low carb, and this completely fills the bill.  It's more expensive than grocery store wheat bread, but well worth the price!

review/summary: this is really bad
review/text: I bought this flavor along with the highlander grogg.  The grogg was fine but the almond amaretto is really bad.  It has a very nasty chemical taste.  I wish I could return it.  I spent $30 plus dollars for 4 12-ounce packages and can't send it back.  Also, it would be better if the company sold just one package or a variety pack but 4 packs of one flavor is too much, especially when it tastes so bad.  I will not buy Coffee Masters coffee beans (of any flavor) again.

review/summary: Great Tangy Flavor, Low Cal, but with Aspartame and a High Pricetag Here..
review/text: I get this at my local supermarket for less than this price buying only one canister at a time. So no discount for buying the two at a time here, and I was actually checking Amazon hoping for a better price than I'm getting at Giant.<br /><br />I love the very tangy flavor, and especially like to freshen and spike the flavor a little more by squeezing a half of a lemon into a 18 oz. glass of it over plenty of crushed ice.<br /><br />It's a pretty good tasting sweetener, but I'm still not convinced Aspartame is harmless. I think some people are sensitive to it, and I may be one, especially since I like this flavor more when using about a third more of the powder than is suggested.

review/summary: Sweet, calming, watch out for the licorice
review/text: Caffeine Free Herbal Tea Sampler, 9 flavors, 2 prettily-colored bags of each. I've tried each flavor at least twice, I always like to put a little bit of sweetener in, the best way is to use about a half-teaspoon to a teaspoon of honey.<br />Purchased in 2010, the Best By date on the package is 2013.<br /><br />I drink a lot of green tea, but I grew up on herbal teas such as Chamomile, Peppermint, and Sleepytime. This was my first time trying Stash herbal tea. I dislike Licorice tea and most of the time all licorice flavor. Be warned: most of these teas contain licorice powder... but -- thank goodness -- I could not taste it in most of the teas, and ended up liking most of them.<br /><br />Wild Raspberry (Hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid, contains soy). At first I found it rather weak, even after steeping for longer than 5 min, but adding honey really brought out the flavor. Nice aroma.<br />Cinnamon Apple Chamomile (Cinnamon, hibiscus, chamomile, and apple flavor).  Really nice smell, the flavor was good and delicious with honey.<br />Lemon Ginger (Ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, and citric acid, contains soy). I was not expecting anything, I haven't liked ginger teas in the past, but in this one the ginger is not so strong. It could still use more lemon but I found it a nice calming flavor. Really nice aroma. Good for at least 2 cups.<br />Blueberry Superfruit (Hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, chicory root, blueberry flavor, blackcurrant powder, citric acid, and licorice powder). Don't be dissuaded by the smell! I thought the licorice in this would overpower me, but on tasting the tea I found it [the licorice] wasn't that strong. I don't really like blueberries or blueberry flavor, but I can enjoy this tea.<br />Mango Passionfruit (Rosehips, orange peel, safflower, hibiscus flowers, lemongrass, mango flavor, citric acid, passionfruit flavor and licorice powder). Nice flavor. Again, I can't taste the licorice powder, it may just add a sort of background flavor to make the teas stronger. Mango is yummy!<br />Acai Berry (Hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, orange peel, chicory root, blackberry flavor, blackcurrant flavor, ace flavor, ace fruit powder, and licorice powder, contains soy). Despite all the ingredients, to me this tasted like a watered down version of the wild raspberry. Boring.<br />Chamomile (hey -- chamomile flowers). I love chamomile tea. This is some of my favorite!<br />Peppermint (Northwest peppermint leaves). I suppose Northwest peppermint is just that much better *shrug*. I love peppermint tea. This tea was nice and strong, real lovely especially with honey. One bag didn't go as far as I thought it would but very good.<br />Licorice Spice  (Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange, cinnamon, clove and cardamom flavors -- I guess it needs extra mention of the cinnamon :p). I do not like licorice, and did not like the smell when I opened this tea bag. I thought for sure I would hate it. Well, it's not so bad. I could stand about 2 cups before it made me feel sick. It doesn't help it's really sweet, I recommend drinking this without any added sweetening.<br /><br />Before getting the Stash pack, I tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LME">Celestial Seasonings Fruit Tea Sampler</a>, and much, very much, preferred the Stash teas. I would like it even better if the Licorice and Acai flavors were swapped out, but I enjoyed trying the variety of teas.<br /><br />**Update**:<br />I noticed that the picture of the packaging changed since I bought the tea -- and there's been a flavor change as well. Instead of the Acai Berry, according to the Product Information on this Amazon page there is now Orange Starfruit (chamomile, orange peel, starfruit flavor, orange oil, safflower and citric acid). Now that sounds good!<br />Also, the Peppermint now is said to be made with Oregon peppermint leaves (is there a difference or they are just being more specific?).

review/summary: Enjoyed most flavors
review/text: We really enjoy Stash teas and saw the sampler as an excellent way to try new flavors, most of which are not available in any of our local stores.  We enjoyed most of the flavors - and have found a new favorite, blueberry.  The aroma and flavor is just like fresh blueberries!  The flavor intensity varies greatly between flavors, which can be a good way to find a flavor to suit your mood.  The ginger, however, was just too strong and burned my taste buds.  I also enjoy Bigelow teas and would agree with another reviewer that some of the Stash flavors (little under half) are mild in comparison.  However, there are times when a gentle chamomile is just what I need.  I probably won't purchase another variety pack, but will purchase our new favorite flavors separately.  I recommend this to anybody looking to experiment with new flavors; Stash has some wonderfully original tastes.

review/summary: Really Pleased
review/text: I was highly pleased with this variety pack.  I had tried the acai berry tea and really wanted more of that, but was hoping to try other flavors and not just buy 6 boxes of one tea.  I was sad the herbal sampler didn't contain acai berry, but I ordered it anyway.  Imagine my delight when it arrived and I realized the orange starfruit tea had been replaced in the sampler by acai berry!  My happiness was complete.  The teas are super flavorful, you just need to know they aren't overly strong, so a smaller serving size is necessary.  They can easily be diluted.  The flavors are fantastic when you steep it correctly.  I had no idea I would love the apple cinnamon chamomile as much as I did.  I've also really enjoyed the raspberry, blueberry, and licorice spice.  It's a great way to get to try so many of the great caffeine-free herbal teas Stash has to offer.

review/summary: Half with licorice flavoring ruins it for me
review/text: I hate licorice flavor.  Half the teas in this pack include licorice powder in them, which ruins it for me.  Why would you add it to the otherwise lovely, fruity flavors of blueberry, mango or raspberry tea? I'm surprised others find these teas to be weak.  As one reviewer pointed out, maybe they were diluting it with too much water.  I love ginger in cooking, and I even like eating pieces of it in dried form.  But in a tea, you expect a hint of it's flavor, not the full strength of the spice. The ginger tea was just too overpowering to the point of being unpleasant.  Although I like the other teas in this box without licorice flavoring, I would not bother buying this sampler box again to get them.

review/summary: Good for Beginner or Novice Chili Heads
review/text: This is a decent hot sauce; mid-to-high level heat. The burn is slow, it builds up for a minute or two, then it's gone. The heat can get intense if you are liberal with your application, but in my opinion, the bark is louder than the bite.<br /><br />The taste leaves a lot to be desired - it's pastey and you taste more soy than tomoato or pepper or vinegar. This sauce is probably best for sandwiches - I wouldn't use it on much else.<br /><br />I recommend this sauce to begineers or novices who are just starting to experiment with real heat. This sauce will bring that heat without being as ruthless as some of the other brands (Dave's and Blair's come to mind). If you love soy sauce, you'll probably like this product as well.

review/summary: Ok, but far from the best
review/text: Hot? Yes.<br /> Tasty? No.<br /><br /> Endorphin Rush is an intense sauce, but it's not one of the better ones.  It's ultra hot, but unlike it's contemporaries (such as Blair's Jersey Death or 357 Mad Dog), the tongue's trip to Hell is short lasted.  The heat doesn't linger as it does with most other hot sauces, almost as if the Endorphin Rush heat factor is an employee being paid for a few meager seconds before punching out and leaving.  Intense, but not malicious.<br /><br /> As for flavor, this is where Endorphin Rush drives off a cliff.  There is no flavor.  It tastes like hot and nothing more (which is a problem I have with Dave's Insanity as well, although even Dave's is tastier than this Tie Dyed stuff).  Other sauces which bludgeon Endorphin Rush in the heat department can also succeed in adding a deep and complex flavor to their burn.<br /><br /> Hotter and better sauces include: Blair's Mega Death, Dave's Ultimate Insanity, Blair's Jersey Death, Black Widow, and 357 Mad Dog.  Go for them Instead.<br /><br />  BTW, I don't ever remember giving this item 4 stars.  I'd give it either 2 or maybe 3, so disregard the 4 stars.  GRRR!

review/summary: Unrelenting Heat
review/text: If tragic events in your life have brought you to such a point where you would actually consider eating this stuff, do yourself a favor and try only a single drop on a chip first (though using even this much is not recommended). If, after enduring heat that transcends time and space, you manage to survive, then you can up the ante.<br /><br />This is not to be confused with your average "hot sauce." This is capsaicin oil, which is the pure extract of the hottest chilis. If you do not respect this substance, it will end you.<br /><br />That being said, I love this stuff. You can add a drop or two to a pot of chili and it spices it up perfectly. Many people are discouraged by the price tag, but this is extract and it will last you a long time (even if you eat spicy food often).<br /><br />The menacingly dark bottle itself comes with a little eye-dropper. This bottle is also put in a mock-prescription bottle (complete with a functioning child-safe push/twist cap). Overall I find this to be a great value, and I'm on bottle #2 now. The first one lasted over a year.

review/text: I bought this to make my own pepper cream for the wifes arthritis. Not to consume. Rub on affected areas, knees, back, elbows etc... I used 20% Pure cap in a mixture of baby oil. 3 oz of baby oil to be exact. Shake well and use where needed for pain relief. Rubbing only a small amount of this provides instant pain relief and LASTS for hours. You can decrease the amount of purecap to your liking. In our case we wanted strong and long lasting. No worries about that. 8 hours later you could still feel the burn. The arthritis pain was totally gone. We used so little of the mixture that the 3 oz of baby oil is going to last months. No more drugs, no more drug expense, no more drug side effects. This is a God send. But.... be real careful! Do not get mixture in your eyes or open wounds. You will be bad shape if you do. Always wash your hands in cold water and have lemon juice ready afterwards to remove residue from your hands or treated areas.<br /><br />I'm sure this product is great in cooking. However since we do not eat peppers I have no idea. Long live natural remedies!

review/summary: Not THE hottest thing out there, but very good and useful
review/text: At 500,000 Scoville, this is not the hottest thing out there but it is very hot. Don't be stupid and put this stuff directly in your mouth, it's pointless. I love using this stuff for cooking because one to three drops goes a long way. I used to have to dump spoonfuls of chili flakes or sauce to get my food to the right heat level, with this, I save a lot of time and money by not having to use peppers as much.

We add 3-6 drops in our sauces and enjoy pure heat without changing the taste! We love it and recomend it to anyone who loves spicy foods!! We use it in everything!

review/summary: Not that hot; not worth the $
review/text: Reading all the reviews, I was pumped for this product. I love hot sauce and make a lot of very spicy food.  I grow hot peppers and have a fridge door full of different hot sauces.<br /><br />Upon arrival the little eye dropper was intimidating.  I poured some salsa into a bowl and daringly added 3 drops and stirred it in.  I started eating the salsa with chips and I couldn't feel the heat at all.  I added another 5 drops, stirred it in, and then i would only call it 'moderate' heat.  All the reviews had me thinking that just a few drops makes a whole pot of chili spicy.  8 drops in a small bowl of salsa was not very impressive.<br /><br />I guess if this stuff was only $5 - $10, i would have given it a more positive review.  But $35!?  it does add heat without any flavor, but nowhere near what i was expecting. My wife put ate a drop a chip said it was nothing even close to the likes of Dave's Insanity or Da Bomb hot sauce.  she didn't even break a sweat.<br /><br />Save your money.

review/summary: LOVE THE HEAT
review/text: I make my own hot sauce and a few drops of this to the gallon adds that extra little "kick" I love so much.  Hell in a bottle is the best way I can describe it.  This is not a sauce, it is a food additive and a little goes a very long way!<br /><br />WORDS TO THE WISE:  If you eat or cook foods containing this stuff be careful at cleanup time.  Rinse your pots, pans and dishes with cold water first.  If you go rinsing with hot water, what you'll get is Capsaisin charged steam which will hit your eyes, throat, nose and lungs like a freight train, making you feel like a mugger on the losing end of pepper spray.<br /><br />Also you'll want to keep this stuff away from children and pets.  I am NOT kidding.  That skull & crossbones on the container is no joke, this stuff could make your child or pet seriously ill if they ate it straight or got it into eyes.

review/summary: Fraud
review/text: I have just received this product and find that it doesn't come close to meeting the claims made on this website. There are warnings about using rubber gloves when handling the product. I intentionally applied a couple drops of the product to my skin and ... NOTHING! No burn, no heat, no pain. I put a drop in a glass of water and it floated on top. I stirred it and drank a little. There was a very slight burning but I've had Chinese food that was a lot hotter.<br /><br />Another unusual observation. This liquid is dark brown in color. I have extracted the juice from a bag of Habanero peppers using a power juicer and the liquid was clear and at least a hundred times hotter than Pure Cap. If this is pure capsicum extract, why is it brown.<br /><br />My advice is to stay as far away from this product as possible. I have totally wasted my money.<br /><br />I have always been very happy with my purchases from Amazon but this product is a rip-off.

review/summary: OMG these are awesome - WOW!
review/text: I was diagnosed with Celiaces about 6 months ago and I've been on a quest to replace some of my most beloved snacks.  I've tried every cheese cracker (and general cracker) that is gluten free with VERY mixed results.  I thought I'd take a chance on these as I had not seen them in stores.  I popped open the bag as soon as they arrived and WOW, these are fantastic, I'd never know they were gluten free. They are triangular in shape and "puffed" not as in puffed rice but just blown up like a hollow pillow so they are very light and crispy and taste EXACTLY like Cheeze-Its which I've been eating for 20+ years.  Totally normal texture and flavor, none of the weirdness you find with other gluten free foods.  I HIGHLY recommend these if you're a CHEESE-IT lover.  These are a permenant on my amazon.com list from here on out.  Thanks Wellabys!

review/summary: Great Taste but Poor Packaging by Amazon
review/text: The snacks are great tasting (according to my daughter who was a fan of cheezits).  However, the box of six came in a larger amazon box with only some paper filling between the tops of the boxes - no padding around the rest of the interior of the box.  Most of the crackers are broken and in crumbs.  Disappointed in the packaging but the product is great.

No grittiness or other negative sometimes associated with GF.  Good source of calcium.  Our whole family enjoys them, even those that eat gluten.

review/summary: Only Gluten Free Cheese Crackers Worth Eating
review/text: I was skeptical when everyone said Cheese Ups taste like Cheeze-Its.  It has been years since I had Cheeze-Its, but I would have to say that this is as close as you can get to those shockingly orange snacks, in a gluten free cracker.  Unlike Cheeze-Its, these have a light airy taste and  a light natural color.  They are crisp, delicious and delightful.  They are puffy and cute like tiny elf hats, and aren't full of unpronounceable ingredients and they taste like real cheese.  They are just the right size to grab, and they have a satisfying taste and crunch.  The thing I really like is that they are delicious and satisfying enough that you won't feel like you need to eat the whole bag.  This is the first gluten free snack cracker that I have had, that I really liked and that's a good enough reason for me to buy them again!  The downside, as almost everyone has noted, is the packaging.  The top of the bag that I opened had very few broken crackers, but the middle and bottom were full of broken shards.  The box they came in was flimsy and crushed in spots.  This is an issue that the manufacturer needs to address.  There is no additional packaging: just six bags packed in a substandard box.  It looks like a display box, and should not have been used for shipping.  That little box should have been packed inside a heavier shipping box,  and had some kind of packing materials to help  prevent the breakage, or at least restrict it.  My box arrived two weeks after the estimated date, and almost a month after I first ordered it, so the next time I order these, I will know not to expect them until I see them.  The vendor couldn't have been nicer when I contacted them, and helped provide the tracking information for me.  I was happy with them and the product, and I will definitely purchase these again.  Definitely worth five stars, but I hope the next batch comes in a heavier box, and with fewer broken pieces.  With gluten free products, breaks are inevitable,  but with some forethought the breakage could be managed, or at least minimized.

The thing about this bottle is that after you've had it for a while, then you switch back to another brand, you'll realized that almost all the other brands have a little (or a lot) of a sour/dry aftertaste.<br /><br />This has none of that, so be careful because it's easy to 'gulp' this thing down!

I had become addicted to drinking Dunkin Donuts vanilla chai when I was working there everyday and I discovered this David Rio vanilla chai and decided to try it. Yum! I recognized the flavor... They used to sell David Rio at the coffee cafes on campus at my old school and that is where my love affair for vanilla chai began. Yes, this stuff is that good -- it's what turned me onto chai tea. I like the smooth flavor of vanilla chai the best. The Elephant Vanilla has a little bit of spice to it but it's creamy and smooth with a bit of sweetness. Other brands I've tried do not compare, this is the best chai out there.

review/summary: 0 cal lifewater is the best
review/text: I can't find enough of this stuff... It's either becoming very popular or is very under stocked, since I find myself cleaning out the entire stock of the two stores nearest me on a weekly basis.<br />You should be able to find this for 99 cents.... beware, some places charge significantly more.<br />Great for diabetics like me, and very refreshing after a swim or hockey game. I like all the flavors except the red colored ones, acai, and yum berry, which remind me too much of hawaiian punch.<br />I have a lot of food allergies too, but haven't had any problem with any of the 0 calorie lifewaters.<br />I'm a natural skeptic and had to look up the ingredients before adopting something that seemed too good to be true. The sweetener used in this stuff is called Erythritol, which from what I've read is a natural substance from fruit and doesn't have all the side effects other sweeteners do, like promoting cavities, obesity, diabetes, or diarrhea.<br />I took it easy at first because i have sensitive bowels, but have found that i can drink this stuff from morning to night and not have any trouble. Although as with anything I eventually get bored and have to switch back to ice tea for a while.<br />I can't say the same for the regular lifewaters or any other beverage except unsweetened ice tea, and water, which get a little boring after a while.<br />This stuff has helped me kick the soda habit and reduce my appetite... thank you sobe!<br />It would be wonderful if I could have this stuff delivered by the case instead of having to go hunting for it a few bottles at a time.

review/summary: Price on SoBe Fuji Apple Pear Lifewater
review/text: I would love to be able to buy SoBe Fuji Apple Pear by the case for my husband.  He has completely given up soda and now drinks Lifewater...however, I pay $1.00 per bottle at our local Wal-Mart Store and would be crazy to spend $125.00 for 24/ 20 ounce bottles...this is outrageous!  Why would anyone want to pay 5 times the price?  I love shopping on Amazon, but on this item you will not get my business!!  Why is it so high?<br /><br />Disappointed

review/text: I have been searching for flavored water that does not have aspartame and was so happy to find this. The apple/pear flavor is very nice, but there's such a strong bitter aftertaste that I just don't care for this water. Perhaps it's the sweetener that's in it. If it was just water and flavoring w/out the sweetener I would give it 5 stars.

review/summary: Decent training treat, as long as your dog isn't super picky!
review/text: Cloud Star's Tricky Trainers are bite-sized, palatable, chewable treats that are approximately 0.5 inches big. They come in three main flavors: cheddar, liver, and salmon. I sampled (well, JP, my dog, sampled) two flavors: cheddar and liver. These treats were perfect sized for putting into a Kong treat dispenser, and were generally palatable (JP finds them much more palatable then dry treats). I found the Tricky Trainers surprisingly more "dry" than most pocket-sized treats, however. In other words, they don't seem to be oily to touch, aren't excessively moist, and have a high anti-squish (i.e., firm) factor. This is beneficial if you're using them as true training treats to reward your dog (i.e., storing them in your pocket). Their con: I found the cheddar smell to be repulsive - it has a really strong smell, so if you're cheese shy, avoid. Cheddar is the 5th ingredient (remember, ingredients are listed in descending order of predominance (from most to least). For the other two flavors, chicken liver and salmon are listed first. The other con: the number of calories per treat isn't listed, so we don't know exactly how "low fat" or "low calorie" they truly are. The final con: if you have a super picky puppy that you are trying to train (and are using these as food motivation rewards), these may not work as well as small pieces of hot dog or pieces of freeze-dried liver treats. When it comes to puppy training, finding a treat that your dog can't resist is imperative to get them to train correctly!<br /><br />These products are listed as wheat and corn free, which is good if your dog has these specific food allergies. That said, if your dog doesn't have these specific allergies, not a big deal. The good news: all ingredients are natural, made in the USA, and the products contain no artificial favors or colors. Overall, a pretty good training treat!

review/summary: Runa Tea
review/text: After you read the label and realize that it has more antioxidants than ANY green tea, and THEN read how much calories it has (only 50), and THEN realize how its caffeine level is just that as much as coffee, you will taste it- and then after you finish the whole serving you will realize how much more awake and refreshed you feel. It's kind of crazy, I was in denial myself. You feel as if you can write a 20 page paper. When it says "focused energy" on the label- you better believe it. The Guayusa tea leaf from the Amazon is something that most beverages have not realized exists, so get on it before some other brand does- because I could imagine if another brand gets on this niche, they're definitely going to mess it up- whether that be via too much added sugars, or artificial flavor. Just do it.

review/text: I am giving this tea a rating of 1. I have not tried it yet, so it may actually be the best tea in the world, HOWEVER, no where in the general or the technical description does it say that this tea INCLUDES Sage and Lavender. If you blow up the picture of the product, it does say in the small print on the label that these two ingredients are included. That being said, I wanted 100% pure Guayusa tea -- which was implied by the written descriptions -- not Guayusa with other ingredients. It would cost almost as much to ship it back as was paid, so I will keep it, but please, Amazon, update your description showing the added ingredients!

review/text: Here is my dual rating based on 2 different shipments:<br /><br />5 Stars -  1st shipment - The best, strongest, most delicious coffee!  My go-to coffee when I want extra bold with a great flavor.  Full-bodied and robust, it is strong enough to brew on the largest setting, and then tweak another brew on the smallest setting.  Absolutely love it!<br /> (These k-cups had solid dark blue tops.  This, apparently, is important.  Read on.)<br /><br />1 Star -  2nd shipment - NOT THE SAME COFFEE AT ALL!!  When I brew it on the largest setting, it is NOWHERE NEAR as strong as the last shipment.  It is totally average, not full-bodied, and the flavor is weak and on the bitter side.  Forget about tweaking another brew - I can't even get 1 large brew with this k-cup!  WHAT GIVES???  I am so disappointed because I thought I had found my perfect coffee, but it is not reliable.  As much as I adored the first shipment, I am now afraid to ever order it again!<br /> (The k-cups this time had the dark blue tops with a RED border, which is different from the first shipment.  They both said Midnight Magic, Extra Bold on them.  I don't know if this detail has anything or everything to do with the strength, but BEWARE!)

I have to say being from New Orleans I LOVE a strong cup of coffee can't stand any bitter aftertaste - and I will tell you fellow "coffee lovers" it did have a little bite to it. If you have been to New Orleans you probably are familiar with coffee and chickory coffee which is very strong but not bitter tasting - I will have to say Timothy's Midnight Magic Decaf is very strong for a decaf & very rich & dark but have come to really like it and will re-order it again. I believe if you give it a try you will not be disappointed in the strong rich flavor. Also put your water setting on the largest setting of water & even if you normally drink it black add some half & half. I believe you will really enjoy this coffee. I gave it 4 stars out of 5 - but it really deserves a 4.5 out of 5. ENJOY!

The only reason I give a 4 star rating is because I did come across a couple k-cups that had a burnt, bitter taste to them. I give it 5 stars on flavor, but 4 due to inconsistency.

For the price, it has no equal.<br /><br />I'm not a heavy coffee drinker, but I am a devoted one. One cup in the morning, every morning.  This coffee does not taste burned in any way, although those who enjoy weak coffee like Dunkin Donuts, McDonalds, or any of the mainstream grocery store brands (Folgers, etc) may disagree (a little extra milk might help them appreciate the richness of this coffee).  I do not feel the caffeine content is too high, and I find the taste to be nutty, earthy, and slightly smoky....just right.  Compared to a cup of bold or extra bold at a local starbucks, this is nowhere near as ashy (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). It holds up to some milk and sugar, and after six months I have not grown tired of it.

review/summary: i love it, but!
review/text: I love this coffe,you have to like stronger coffee to buy this one.I use to live in France and they all drink expresso all the time.I would like it even stronger. This coffee is strong And not bitter.The only thing that upset me was I order the two pack for 17.95 every 3months to block the price. and then went to update to every month,but they put the price up to 19.95?

review/summary: A great way to purchase good coffee
review/text: I enjoy receiving coffee K-cups through Amazon.  The coffee is very good, the delivery is very convenient and the price is the best I have found.  I will most likely continue to purchase my coffee this way from Amazon.  Pat Schwartz

review/summary: Good but too strong for me
review/text: We have the Breville brewer and find that this coffee is just too strong for our tastes. If you use the large cup setting, it is e a slightly strong version of french roast at Starbucks and if you use the travel mug setting, it is like a slightly weaker version of the same but quite frankly too strong to me. I gave it a good rating because it is exactly what is says it is, a really strong coffee, just be aware that they are not lying when they say it is extra bold! If you like starbucks french roast though, you have found your coffee.

review/summary: robust and satisfying!
review/text: This is one of my 2 fav. coffees. It is flavorful and intense. My husband likes his fairly weak, so I brew a small size for me and a large size for him from the same K-cup; works perfectly!

review/summary: Love's this coffee
review/text: I was trying to pick out some new coffee for my husband.  He likes bold flavors; so when I saw this coffee had so many positive reviews I decided to give it a try.  He now has a new favorite coffee.  I love the review system.  It makes buying or not buying items so much easier.

review/summary: I'm hooked
review/text: What can I say - this is good stuff. I bought Timothy's to brew when I couldn't use my coffee press - then the convience along with the great flavor of Midnight Magic religated my press to occasional use. In fact, I'm going to brea a cup right now!
