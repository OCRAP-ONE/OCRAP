review/summary: Life saver food
review/text: My little guy suffered two urinary blockages. For anyone who has gone through this knows how scary it is and EXPENSIVE it is to treat. My vet told me I could keep him on his regular food as he mainly eats wet food but I started feeding him Halo's cat food- the wet chicken formula since it's not as high in protein which caused part of his problem. This dry food is excellent for urinary health issues. My cat has not suffered another blockage since I have had him on this food regularly and he hasn't had anymore UTI's either which I am happy about and hope it continues. And the best part is he loves the food so I didn't have to worry about that either. They use real chicken in this food and there is no by product or fake crap. If you have a cat who suffers from FLUTD or UTI- give this food a try- it works geat!

review/summary: Wrong Item sent....can't figure out where to deal with this issue.
review/text: Ordered six "hairball formula" bags of cat food. Received "Adult Formula."<br />Sorting through the multitude of areas is mind boggling. There must be a simpler way to notify that you've received the wrong item.<br />Usually Amazon is much more responsive.<br /><br />Also...the packaging is awkward. I ordered small packages to make them easier to handle and store but they come packed together and are awkward to handle until the wrapping is removed.

review/summary: My two kitties love Purina One.
review/text: I have two cats.  They have eaten Purina One for six years now. Their coats are shiny and they both look healthy and have lots of energy. They are both eleven years old.  I started feeding them Purina One because the first ingredient on the label was chicken. There are also no artificial colors or flavors and unlike some pet foods it is manufactured in the United States. Those are enough reasons for me to choose this particular food. I think that even though Purina One is not the best of the best of cat foods, it is a good value for the price, and the cats love it. My male kitty will not eat anything else. A tip for anyone just introducing a new food to your kitty:  Introduce the food slowly by mixing just a little of the new food with the old food.  Increase the amount each time you feed the kitty eventually eliminating the quantity of the previous food.  This will help to alleviate any stomach upset that your kitty may experience from a new food.

review/summary: My cat's favorite dry food
review/text: I have a very picky older cat. She is probably extra picky because she's old and has trouble digesting some cat foods. This one though is her favorite dry food. She begs for it and waits by her bowl one hour before dinner. My other cat also gets very excited about this food. I've found with other foods that they get occasional hairballs, but with this one it's a very rare occasion for either of them to have a hairball- maybe once a year. Previously when I fed them the cute cat foods (like Meow Mix) half of the food would stay in the bowl and the older cat was particularly adept at separating out the shapes she didn't like.<br /><br />Although the price on Amazon is very competitive to buying single bags at the grocery store, I found that the 16 pound bag at Pet Smart goes on sale for $18.99 and the last bag I bought included a $5 Pet Smart gift card. If I only had one cat though I would definitely buy from Amazon for the convenience factor and the price is competitive with Tar get and other grocers.<br /><br />Both of my cats got shinier coats as well since making the switch to Purina One a few years ago. There are several formulas (in addition to this one) to meet your particular cats needs:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BEXBCS">Purina One Cat Food Sensitive System, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br />Purina One Cat Food Vibrant Maturity 7+ Senior Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BEXBAK">Purina One Cat Food Advanced Nutrition Hairball Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDI0QQ">Purina One Cat Food Salmon & Tuna Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDEI7G">Purina One Cat Healthy Weight Management, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDI0RA">Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BETMEO">Purina One Cat Food Chicken & Rice Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDI0RK">Purina One Cat Food Urinary Tract Health Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: The vet made me get the expensive food his office pushes on everyone and I'm sure gets paid to sell to his patients. I fed this to my cat and he went from a healthy 12 pounds up to 20 pounds.  I went right out and got the Purina food and began feed it to my cat. That was 4 months ago and now he is back down to 15 pounds and I am NOT getting any more expensive vet food.

review/summary: Advice
review/text: Please make sure you buy this food in small quantities at first if you are unsure that your cat will like it. Our Russian Blue treats it like medicine because he hates the taste of it. He only eats it because we have been strict with his diet and refuse to give him much else besides the urinary formulated foods. We intend to stop buying this product completely.<br /><br />Our most effective food for him has been the Royal Canin Urinary Formula (you can only get it from the vet), as he loves it and it keeps his pH in check - however, it's $50 for a 7 lb bag. Not too pretty.<br /><br />We also tried the more expensive "Pro Plan" equivalent - and it is the same product in a different bag, which made it even worse. Both products do work (this one and the Pro Plan) but good luck trying to feed it!<br /><br />We now feed wet Friskies "Special Diet : Urinary pH" and our cats love it! It comes in beef, chicken, or (the best one) ocean whitefish. It's very affordable as well. Check it out.<br /><br />If you still decide to try this out, please please please buy a small bag first so you know your cat will not hate it!

review/summary: Saved my carpets and possibly my cat
review/text: For years my cat has had digestive issues no matter what food I've given her.  I've spoken to the vet about this a few times and more than one vet simply told me "Some cats throw up more than others".<br /><br />I tried a few other sensitive stomach-type cat foods, including Eukanuba, which is considered one of the best on the market.  Not only did the Eukanuba not work, but because the fiber content in it was so high, I had to change my litter boxes twice as often as I had to previously.<br /><br />This cat food has been a life saver for both of the cats I have with digestive issues.  It has reduced the number of times my cat throws up significantly, from a few times a week, to once or less (outside of normal hairballs).  The other cat with some litterbox issues have cleared up almost entirely.<br /><br />Well worth the money (which is far less on Amazon than any local pet store I've found).<br /><br />If you have a cat with a sensitive stomach, this is the answer.

review/summary: Kitties love it and a lot less expensive than the vet's
review/text: One of the kitties has a very sensitive tummy, and I had been spending quite a bit of money, not to mention the inconvenience of running to the vet's every couple of weeks to buy their "special" brand.  One day I noticed that Purina made the vet's brand, and started to wonder if they made a version sold in the grocer.  Sure enough, Sensitive Systems from the Purina One line was in the store.  I slowly transitioned the kitties to it without any ill effects.  Purchasing this on the regularly scheduled delivery not only lowered my costs, it is so convenient to come home and find it waiting on my doorstep!  I am really pleased with the Purina One brand.  The cats are healthy, and can't wait for me to get up in the morning to bring it to them.

Purina has changed the recipe, and its hard to find the old formula that was made with yogurt. My cat has a sensitive stomach and has thrown up all foods we have tried besides the type made with yogurt. Now that the recipe has changed, he is throwing up daily again. I was so excited to see I could buy the yogurt version on AMAZON in bulk... till it arrived. This is not the product I wanted, the picture is very misleading considering their disclaimer says that all ingredients may not be listed on the site. Its on the picture so I thought I would get what I saw.

review/text: Don't be dissappointed in your machine if this is the first T-disc flavor you've tried. It's not your Tassimo, it's the coffee blend. I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic "coffee". The "crema" is not much more than window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino.

review/summary: We know it we love it..but the hidden sugar....................
review/text: Wheat Thins have been a favorite snack cracker for me for many a year past.However until  this shipment--I have been foregoing crackers a lot over the last three years or so.<br /><br />They taste as good as I remember...and I loved snacking on them...<br /><br />My only  problem with these crackers is what I discovered as I read the box after finishing the contents off. It has 4 grams of sugar per serving. This small box has 3 servings. This makes  12 grams of  sugar per box....so only eat  a portion of it.<br /><br />Still...I will enjoy them occasionally !

review/summary: Wheat Thins are the CHEESE!!!
review/text: These are the best crackers available on the market, and that's a fact!! I love these things. They're soooo good, and packed with tons of sodium and other nutritious ingredients such as Riboflavin. Riboflavin rocks!! Riboflavin is an ideal source of B12, which helps make red blood cells. And who doesn't love red blood cells!!! Also, Wheat Thins have monoglycerides, which improve loaf volume, and create a smooth, soft crumb. I love high loaf volume!!!<br /><br />The best thing about this cracker is that it's indestructible. Seriously, you take one of these babies to a tub of the creamiest cheese spread around and they ain't crackin'. They hold up to abuse nicely. Snack with confidence!!!<br /><br />The second best thing about this cracker is that it will last forever, which I'm pretty sure is 100% true. You can stock up on Wheat Thins and not worry about them going bad. It's probably because Butylated hydroxytoluene is added to preserve freshness! If you don't know what Butylated hydroxytoluene is, look into it!! It's awesome!!!<br /><br />Did I mention that Sandy Duncan loves Wheat Thins?? If not, Sandy Duncan loves Wheat Thins! She eats them right out of the box!! She starred as Sandy Hogan on the Hogan family!!! Have you seen the Hogan Family? Me neither!!!!<br /><br />In conclusion, Wheat Thins are the best ever!! You should buy a box. Giddy up!!

review/summary: Intense product
review/text: I found it to be a very sharp, raw product. Works very well on its own, but difficult to combine with other ingredients. The chocolate is just too overpowering. I tried infusing it with herbs and spices, but none of it showed up. The chocolate is tight and composed, with earthy tones. Somehow anything you add to it only serves to bring out more of the chocolate's textures and flavor; I found it hard to tone it down, much less balance it out. Works very well as a base for chocolate souffle.

review/summary: Gypsy Moth Trap
review/text: Gypsy Moth larvae devestated a spruce bush in our garden early this summer (2010).  Anticipating that we did not manage to collect all of the caterpillars (we tried - by hand) and therefore some would become moths, we ordered a trap from Amazon.com.  They arrived within 5 business days as promised.  The BioLure scent strip design no longer has an adhesive backing to attach it to the trap's top - it is now supposed to adhere via static cling (cost reduction?), which worked initially.  While hanging the trap on a tree branch, a pair of Gypsy Moths appeared out of nowhere and fluttered manically at and around the trap, trying to reach the seductive source inside.  They figured out how to get inside after a couple of minutes, and then knocked themselves silly in a mating frenzy, finally dropping into the poly bag, along with the scent strip which they had dislodged.  So I disassembled the unit, disposed of the moths, and reattached the scent strip with a piece of clear tape.  Much better!  Feedback to Safer - please go back to the self-adhesive strip design or change your instructions to use tape to attached the strip.  Over the course of three weeks, we removed a dozen or more moths (emptied from the bag into a jar of soapy water to drown them).  Watching the trap closely, we noticed that some of the moths exit the trap as easily as they enter it - they got their fill of pheremones and then went on their merry way.  Conclusion is that these traps will reduce the population of Gypsy Moths, but will not capture every one that stops by for a sniff!  After 3 weeks, there were no more takers.  Impression is that the scent strip lasts about half the duration that is advertised on the package.

review/summary: Best Energy Drink on the planet; just a word of advice
review/text: Monster Energy gives you the buzz and kick you need to keep you going. I have been drinking these for almost 3 years now and they are great. I ordered my first 24-pack case of these yesterday on Amazon with $3.99 Prime overnight shipping and now they're in my fridge cooled and ready to drink :D<br /><br />Just a word of advice, though. Drink these energy drinks in moderation. Even though the label states to limit 3 cans per day.. just drink 1. Really, you'll feel a lot better drinking one for the day instead of going all out and chugging half the case. There is 80mg of caffeine per serving, 160mg if you drink the entire 16oz can. If you really need two, spread them out hours apart.. one in the morning, and one in the afternoon. The maximum caffeine any person should take in a day is 300mg, but try to keep it at 200mg and lower at most occasions. And if you can, drink one every 2-3 days.. be strong of yourself and avoid the addiction of caffeine this product brings you. This way, you can still enjoy the biggest, baddest energy drink on the planet without risking you with health effects that occur when taken in excess.<br /><br />Don't believe all the hype that energy drinks are truly bad for you. I call any energy drink a "neutral beverage", because it's not good for you, but it's also not bad for you. You'll get it :)<br /><br />Also, if you're looking on cutting down on sugar and carbs, try the Lo-Carb Monster (blue)... it has a more sweet taste than the regular one and you'll feel guiltless drinking one. I believe it doesn't contain the evil "aspartame" from diet sodas and such, so try it :)<br /><br />Unleash the Beast!!!

review/text: Love alimentum. It helps my colicky baby digest the formula better than any other we've tried.  The price breaks the bank though, so we try to buy it in larger quantities to save on the costs. I am highly disappointed w/ this seller, Marble Med Supplies. They sold the formula w/ an inaccurate description regarding the quantity, then claimed I was getting a deal when I was paying more than double what I would pay at any national drug store. They have this listed as 5 packs, but are apparently trying to break packs up and just sell five individual cans. Save yourself the hassle and don't buy alimentum formula f/ this amazon seller. Paid $80 for what is apparently two 6 packs of 8 oz cans - $30 at any CVS. And then this seller has the nerve to tell me I'm getting an extra can as a deal? What a joke!

review/summary: You can't under estimate yucca and tapioca flour!
review/text: As a celiac, I've struggled to find good bread products. I can confidently says that Yoki provides the best (and easiest) Brazilian cheese bread mix. Chebe is another great brand for this food, but they require you to grate and mix in your own cheese (which can be good if you're looking to be creative). My one suggestion: The more homogenous your batter is, the smoother and crispier the rolls will be. Mix that dough to death! You'll get a much better end product.<br /><br />Also, if you're new to Gluten Free cooking, make use of flours like yucca and tapioca. They provide an elastic quality similar to gluten. My favorite baking flours include mixes like tapioca, potato starch, and almond or fava bean flour. You don't have to fight with those icky, dry rice flours anymore!

review/summary: Great authentic Brazilian product and great for gluten free!
review/text: This brings back so many memories from living in Brazil. Pao de queijo is often eaten as a breakfast food along with coffee or hot chocolate. I've been having to travel up to Toronto to find my stash and it costs me $2.50-2.75 per box, so it's actually cheaper to have Amazon send it to me. I love it!<br /><br />When I make mine, I add a little extra cheese to it - usually grated parmasaen that I have in the fridge. Also, to make your little balls, a medium cookie scoop works well for the amount of dough you will use. Keep a little cooking oil by you because you will want to form the balls with your hands. A little oil on your palm between each ball will keep it from sticking too much and it helps them cook up nicer. The box says to let them get golden, but I find that the tops don't turn very gold in color. As they start to crack as they expand, you know you are close. I usually go about a minute longer than the time says. When you pull them out, you'll notice the bottoms are nice and golden.<br /><br />Make sure you eat them all. Pao de queijo doesn't reheat very well. Try them the Brazilian breakfast way with your favorite coffee or even better, hot chocolate - you'll love 'em!

review/summary: It's not Fogo de Chao cheese bread, but it's good
review/text: The product comes with straightforward and clear instructions.  It's not as good as cheese bread I've had in my favorite Brazilian steakhouse, but this product is a very reasonable substitute when I have a craving for cheese bread yet don't want to spend the $50/person price to eat out.  Like other reviewers indicate, the cheese breads turn out best when the dough gets worked thoroughly into the smoothest possible consistency.

review/summary: REAL Maple Syrup
review/text: I thought maple syrup was maple syrup but, apparently things have changed over the last several years.  I noticed a while back that the maple syrup I purchased in the store (even organic) had an "odd" taste.  It just didn't taste right.  I tried several types but, with the same result.<br /><br />Then I read a review on here about Vermont having tougher standards for maple syrup.  As in something about not allowing other sweeteners or something, don't remember exactly.<br /><br />Anyway, I decided try Brown Family Pure Vermont Maple Syrup.  Wow, major taste difference, even the after taste lingers and is very nice.  I also bake bread with maple syrup, the smell of the baking bread, and the bread flavor are much more distinct maple.

I was pleasantly surprised at how thick this syrup is--my husband had to check to make sure it was just maple syrup (I've been buying our maple syrup at Sam's Club & I guess we didn't realize just how runny that syrup is)<br />This has a rich amber color and great maple flavor that you can still taste even with a whole lot of butter on your pancakes or waffles (my son likes lots of butter)<br />My only complaint is that it is messy to pour. I have had other bottles of syrup with similar shaped spouts that have not been messy whereas with this spout the syrup glug-glug-glugs out.

review/text: I just ordered a second jug of this syrup after finishing off my first jug yesterday.  There are some things upon which one cannot skimp, and real maple syrup is one of them.  I grew up with Mrs. Butterworth's, but now that I'm older (and buying my own groceries!), I've found that there really is no comparison between real maple syrup and the other stuff.  A 12-oz container of maple syrup is $7.99 at the grocer in my area, so this 32-oz jug is easily a better deal (and it tastes great).  Unlike the stuff from the store, this syrup is from Vermont!  Overall, I highly recommend this syrup on the bases of price and taste.

review/summary: Fake maple syrup is a crime against food
review/text: When the food packaging laws were revised back in the 90s, the word "maple" disappeared off a lot of syrup bottles because they had no maple in them. Thankfully, this is the real stuff. It has a delicate maple flavor. Great for icing, maple cookies and breakfast for those who prefer a hint of maple taste. If you want a stronger maple taste, go with a grade B syrup.<br /><br />Real maple syrup is thinner than the flavored corn syrup you may be used to. It's also a lot more expensive. You can get the most out of it by pouring the syrup into a small bowl, cutting the pancakes/waffles/French toast into pieces and dipping them in the syrup with a fork. That way it doesn't get wasted when you wash the plate.

We use very few sweeteners, but when I need something really special for a fruit and nut bar treat I add a bit of this syrup and WOW! the flavor explodes.  We sometimes use it on blueberry buckwheat pancakes also and that makes a breakfast from heaven.  There may be better maple syrups out there somewhere (or not?) but at this price I think the Brown Family brand should satisfy most anyone.

review/summary: TOTALMENTE NATURAL Y DELICIOSO
review/text: Lo compre para hacer la famosa dieta de la limonada, y el sabor es excelente , se nota que es totalmente natural el unico contra que le veo es ke no es un litro completo sino 946ml que en mi caso para la dieta son necesarios por que uno se alimenta de esto solamente por minimo 10 dias. por otra parte a quien le interese estaba comparando con la miel de abejas natural y creo que esta seria un sustituto perfecto para la dieta tienen muchos minerales y viaminas en comun, asi que la proxima vez ke haga la dieta la hare con miel de abeja, pero insisto en que este producto Maple Syrope es excelente.
