review/summary: Perfect pasta, healthy choice
review/text: This orzo is absolutely delicious, with a firm bite and an astounding 9 g of fiber in every serving (and when it comes to pasta, that's what you should be looking for on the package). This is the healthiest and most delicious choice I've found in whole grain pastas, bar none. The orzo shape is great for cold salads and hot dishes alike -- I really like making a hot caprese-style pasta dish with this stuff. I don't buy anything else ... and you can't beat Amazon's price for the 4-pack, particularly if you select the automatic shipment option (I get a new pack every 3 months).

review/summary: ECONOMICAL WAY TO BUY A HARD TO FIND PRODUCT
review/text: After searching unsuccessfully in many grocery stores for whole wheat orzo, I was delighted to find this product at Amazon.  Although you have to buy a lot, the shelf life is excellent, and the price is quite reasonable.  I prefer the taste and texture to regular orzo, and the health benefit of whole grains is a plus.  Although the directions tell you to boil and drain it like pasta, I cook it like rice.  Simmer 1 cup orzo in 2 cups liquid stirring occassionally until liquid is absorbed and pasta is tender.

review/text: Dieting since mid-May using whole grains in pastas, rice, etc, and this orzo in whole wheat is just not able to be found anywhere but here--so happy to find it. (Now if I could also find whole grain orecchiette too, hint). With 9 grams of fiber per 2oz serving, this orzo delivers high fiber, just what I wanted.  Use it in rice dishes like pilafs and stuffed peppers, add to soups, or just serve as a side dish on its own w/butter and sage, etc..no need to go back to white orzo anymore.

review/summary: Great food
review/text: We've been looking all over for a wheat orzo and decided to try this. It has worked very well in all our orzo recipes, hot and cold, save for one that was just OK. It has a stronger flavor than regular pasta made with bleached flour, so it does best in recipes with bolder flavors. Like most wheat pastas, it needs to be boiled for just the shortest amount of time, so that it remains very firm. We haven't overcooked it yet, so I can't say if it will get mealy and mushy like a lot of wheat pastas do. Highly recommended.

In the second receipe I didn't have the seasoning quite like it should have been but both recipes I tried were good.  I will work on the seasoning.  I liked the idea of having something that cooked so quickly, was whole wheat, organic, etc.

Since I switched over to whole wheat pasta and had so many recipes that called for orzo, this was a problem.  Yes, you buy a few jars at a time, but they keep forever, and the jars are small, so I am not worried about the product being on my shelf past the expiration date.  Very tasty, too!

review/text: Ever wonder why veggies at restaurants taste better than they do at home? Vegetable Magic may be the reason. We eat a lot of catered foods and are always asking for recipes and Chef Paul's name comes up a lot.

review/summary: Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning Blends
review/text: I have been using different seasonings for years. I have found that with this seasoning, Vegetable Magic, that I do not have to use anything else when seasoning my food. It has just the right amount of spiciness to it. We use it on everything, including meats, soups, etc. Not only vegetables. I would give this 5 stars and would recommend it 100%. We tried it about a year ago for the first time. We went through a whole canister in a year and there are only 2 people at home. It goes far, but we love it!! I just got another one!!

review/text: I've been using this for at least 15 years.  Started when I did "Fit for Life" and was stir frying veggies.  My family loved the veggies, they were finished every night.  I've been using it ever since, on veggies and meat.  Great in hamburgers, on pork chops, chicken, etc.  It's our favorite of all the seasonings that Chef Paul sells. My grown children with families of their own are using it too.  I've also used it in some of my home made salad dressings.

Ok, not really.  But broccoli, asparagus, pizza, chicken, toast and eggs.  Even better, when you mix veggie magic w/ olive oil, you are an instant gourmand.<br /><br />Guests always ask why our food is so delicious (no matter what we serve) and the answer is always "chef prudhomme's veggie magic".

review/text: I like this version of the crystal light lemonades the best. It has more of an authentic taste to it. The only problem is that when I compare the flavor of the canister pack product to the on-the-go packets, the canister seems a little weaker and more acidic. Maybe it's just my imagination, or it could be the concentration although I follow the directions for both products. I would recommend this product for lemonade lovers above any others though. It is tangy, not syrupy sweet. Yum.

review/text: First, I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate. I'm not really a huge chocolate fan in general - but I've preferred milk chocolate over dark. This chocolate is does not taste anything like other dark chocolates. I find the flavor robust, but in a subdued way (a contradiction, I know). It is hard to describe, but this is one of the best chocolates I've tasted. It has a unique grainy texture that is fabulous. The price (currently $5.99 here at Amazon) is very high though. I pay about 4.59 at a local grocery store (and no shipping charges). I buy at least one per week to feed my addiction.

review/text: I love chocolate with cinnamon in it, and artisan chocolates in general, so i had such high hopes for this product. It disappointed me.<br /><br />First off, it was grainy, in a too-much-sugar way, not a coarsely-ground-cacao-way. If you break off a piece, you can see the sugar crystals glinting in the chocolate.<br /><br />Second, it had almost no flavor. I couldn't taste the cinnamon at all, and the even chocolate itself was weak.<br /><br />It smells wonderful, but tastes like grainy nothing.

review/summary: The truth in verjuice
review/text: Acid is, oddly, the most benign of flavor amplifiers.  Think about it.  Sugar? Salt? Alcohol? Fat?  I do not mean in any way to be a food fear monger. I merely point out that first glance, acid seems more menacing than any of those.  For kitchen magic, acid rules mine.  A splash of lime, coffee in my red-eye gravy, all those wonderful vinegars are lining my shelf.<br /><br />Now the resurgence of an ancient and feisty acid, verjuice.  It has largely been neglected outside of wine country.  Most of mine comes from odd places in Bordeaux.  But you can get this fine find from Fallot, a most reliable maker from Burgundy.  You may know their fine mustards.  This is one verjuice which you may confidently measure others against.  Why?<br /><br />Verjuice had not had modern marketing to spread its unique quality and flavor.  Sour grapes, you say? Exactly.  What do you do when the weather is so crumby that the grapes are not sweet enough for wine?  A good excuse to press verjuice.<br /><br />Now for the bad news.  Verjuice is in resurgence.  As with all things rediscovered, many are busy "helping" its image with a facelift.  Culinary botox.  From California to Australia, everybody is getting into the act; thin or flabby faux verjuice is hitting the shelves.  All cute and flouncy, it has not the backbone and courage to do the heavy lifting in the kitchen.  You might as well pour lemonade over your grilled salmon.<br /><br />But here is the acidic glory.  Taste it alone.  Now you can compare anything you might run across.  Some vineyards make the veritable verjuice.  Next, try poaching gently some fresh and really ripe fruit.  It loves to be swirled into your beurre blanc.  Whip some into your best cream.  Deglaze the roasting pan for some old time gravy.  Nutmeg and a nice five pepper blend (don't forget the allspice) are all you need for your steamed vegetables.  "What did you do?"  And you can tell the truth.

review/summary: fly trap
review/text: When i received my fly trap all of the traps were closed so i called the "help line" and asked the guy if that was normal. the man on the other line spoke such poor english i could hardly understand him, i had to get him to repeat everything he said. he told me that the heads closed were ok that they would open in a few weeks i was like well ok, so about a week passes and the traps still are closed and they begin to get black spots on them so i call the help line again and he says oh thats normal  it should go away in about a week . so time goes on and still the traps remain closed and the black has completely covered two of them. so i read online that if they get black spots on them to immediately pop the head off and a new one should grow back, so i did but the rest of the leaf just got really black and began to limp over.  ive had my fly trap for about 3 and a half weeks now  and they still haven't lost the black on them, one of the heads have opened but it is dead. i did EXACTLY what the instructions said to do but still no luck. dont be fooled by the photo on this item it is NOT ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE SIZE IN THE PHOTO. it is maybe a third of the size in the photo. very disappointed!

review/summary: Have't killed it yet
review/text: We've had this little plant for about 2 months now and it trucks along.  It is relatively low maintenance.  We just have to add water to it every now and then.  It needs to sit in about 1" of water and stay virtually swampy, but that's it.  He sits in the window sill and catches unlucky flies that happen his way.  The plant is constantly dying on one head and producing another one.  (That seems like a healthy plant to me).  I have 8,6 and 4 year old boys and they love to watch him catch things.  Every now and then we'll kill a fly with a fly swatter and hand feed the plant.  :)

The plant arrived with 6 TINY traps of which 3 were in dormancy (fully black and dried out - but hey I live in VA so it's cold here).  So you can imagine I was somewhat disappointed at first.  Then I stuck with it and kept raising it for 3 weeks.  New traps grew and the plant seems to be doing fairly well.  The traps are also looking bigger.<br /><br />I would recommend this purchase, but buyers should not expect a PERFECT plant to arrive.

review/summary: Perfect
review/text: This is the second 6 pack I am having. I am used to having my tea with milk since childhood but wanted to turn vegan. If I follow the same process to make tea with same ingredients and leave out milk, it will be too bitter. I went all over the place and tried a zillion different kinds of tea and this one is the best. I am a 100% vegan now.<br /><br />I travel a lot. The coffee at gas stations and hotels is usually cheap and I hate it. I carry a handful of these and use it in hot water at gas stations or coffee maker in hotels.<br /><br />At home - I drink a LOT of tea. Lot of the spices listed on the packet are readily available at affordable prices at Indian grocery stores but they will be non organic. I have experimented with boiling those with fresh ginger root and long leaf black tea leaves. The output I get is different from Good Earth but inspired by them and equally flavorful. Over few attempts, I learned the proportions and boiling time to perfection. You got to be tea lover to do so much.

review/summary: My favorite black chai
review/text: This tea actually tastes less 'spicy' than other chais, so the name is almost a bit misleading.  It could be described as more mellow than bold.  But, don't let this deter you if you favor bold teas. The complexity of this tea really works!! It has a wonderfully well balanced and pleasing flavor.  The additional herbs give it an added complexity not found in most chais and even a hint of sweetness. For maximum flavor I recommend steeping this for the full 6 minutes suggested. And, be sure to use two teabags if you're using an extra large mug. Love it!

I think it is mellow all on its own but could understand the appeal for some to use milk.  I'm not a fan of sweet teas so I wouldn't want the sugar or honey traditionally served with chai.  I've even used one tea bag with a bunch of regular tea bags to make some iced tea that's quite nice in the summer.  Folks who have tried it who often want sweetener in their tea tell me it's not necessary with this combination.  Hot, it makes a great mug to hug.  Yumm!

review/summary: Best Granola Bars from Kashi
review/text: This is, by far, the best granola bar I've tried from Kashi. The bar is chewy and you can really taste the fruit/nuts. It has 4 grams of fiber, 6 grams of protein and whole grains. I feel like I'm eating something good for me! The sugar is 6 grams and I don't find it too sweet at all.

review/summary: Great Granola Bars
review/text: I wasn't sure when I ordered these if I would like them or not.  (Especially after reading the product description and being someone who is practically scared of the words "fiber, "wheat", etc., basically anything that could be considered "good" for me :).  I was pleasantly surprised.  They are not too sweet, just sweet enough, and they are delicious.  So many different flavors and textures all at the same time.  I would buy again.

review/summary: Too sweet for my taste
review/text: I tried this as an alternative to Kashi's Honey Almond Flax (Chewy Granola) bars, which I love almost as much as the Roasted Almond Crunch (Crunchy Granola) bars. It's possible I'd like the Tail Mix bars when I'm in the middle of a long, strenuous hike, but it could be months before I test that hypothesis. Simply put, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, and these are overly sweet for me as a mid-afternoon snack at the office.<br /><br />However, after trying this and that without much satisfaction, I've found a solution that will help me get through all these bars rather than having to ship them back. I bought some Uncrystallized Candied Ginger at Trader Joe's, and the heat of the ginger--plus a few almonds--is a perfect foil. (For those of you wondering, the sweetness is from dried cranberries and raisins.)

review/summary: The least grossly sweet energy bars I've found.
review/text: They're still sweeter than I'd like, but they taste less like candy than any other bar I've tried, so they're my favorite. They store well, too - you can carry them around in your bag or car and the constant temperature changes aren't a big problem for them.

review/text: i guess its because i LOVE sugar that this particular item tasted only a little bit less than cardboard! YUK! sure, i will eat the entire 2 boxes i got for FREE but i wont be enjoying it though. these needed just a bit more sweetness, so i suppose i can always dip them in honey to get the flavour i want. other than that they have a lot of good stuff in them thats good for you, but i like what goes in my mouth to have some flavour to it as well

Fruit Medley is a mix of peaches, grapes, pineapple, banana, and orange.  A great start for babies beginning to eat more solid foods!

review/summary: Good but old
review/text: I think if I had received fresh crackers this rating would have been a five.  Purchased off the discount deal last month and the Sell By date was June 2012.  Got a case of 6 and got rid of 3 due to opening the first box and the oil was going rancid. I was really disappointed because the cracker was, even with the off taste, one of the best I have had Gluten Free.  So now I open the package and leave it open two days and then the taste is not bad with cheese or some topping.  So I am going to try some fresh ones when I have some extra cash or can buy them at the local Whole Foods to see if they are better.

review/text: My grandfather owned a small bakeshop in Scotland and I remember that Nairns oatcakes were the most popular with his customers.<br />As a kid oatcakes did not appeal to me but I subsequently developed a taste for them and like most of my grandfather's customers found that Nairns were the preferred brand. They were fired a little longer than other manufacturers oatcakes producing a crispier bite.

review/summary: Excellent oatcakes
review/text: As others have said, these are a little dry, but they have a very nice flavour, and they are very healthy. Other brands of oatcakes can contain sugar and more fat, these contain no added sugar. The organic oatcakes can be eaten on their own, but they are excellent with a thin slice of cheese, or spread with a little hummus. I prefer Nairns Cheese Oatcakes for eating on their own, but because they contain cheese they do have more fat and less fiber than the organic variety.

review/summary: Excellent organic white flour - No more bloating or puffiness after eating flour!
review/text: I've been using Hodgson Mill Organic Naturally White Flour for about a year now. One of the first things I noticed after baking with this flour is that I no longer "bloated" or had intestinal distress after eating the foods made with this flour. Soooo nice! My doctor recommended this flour to me, and I'm glad I followed his recommendation. I did an experiment to make sure that it wasn't a coincidence that after eating the Hodgson Mill Organic Naturally white flour I didn't bloat, become puffy, etc. I made some cookies and muffins using the Hodgson Mill flour, and I made the same cookie and muffin recipe with typical white flour (all the rest of the (organic) ingredients were identical). I had intestinal distress, bloated, and had facial and hand puffiness after eating the desserts with the typical flour. When the bloating subsided, I waited an additional 6-8 hours, and I ate the desserts made with the Hodgson Mill flour....nothing happened - no bloating, no puffiness, and I felt great. The Hodgson Mill flour makes you feel good after eating it. I'm delighted to find a flour that doesn't have an adverse reaction on me. ALSO! The flour bakes and cooks great. The texture is wonderful - actually better than typical flour. My cookies, breads, muffins, pie crust, brownies, gravy, etc come out wonderful with this flour. I receive a lot of compliments on my desserts when using Hodgson Mill organic flour. Sometimes people find it hard to believe when I tell them that the flour is organic and naturally white. They can't believe the flour produces such great results.<br /><br />The flour ships quickly and stores well on your pantry shelf. I keep it in the refrigerator after opening it. I like that it comes in two pound bags - very convenient for me. I definitely recommend this flour.

review/summary: Truly fantastic
review/text: I make my own bread, we also have a weekly pizza night, and I do a lot of baking besides. I am seriously surprised at how much a difference this flour makes. Everything is just better. The flour is very fine, lite, soft, and powdery. I don't consider the cost to be too high compared to the average price I would pay for the "Gold" stuff I usually buy on sale at the grocery store. I don't see any other unbleached all purpose flour that is that much difference of a price, at least not here on Amazon. With subscribe & save, i consider thise a good deal. I just wish it were in larger bags, and came in 20lbs. I have to double my order since we go through so much in a month.

review/summary: Dang It.  It's Really Good.
review/text: Ugh.  This flour is really good.  I was hoping there was not much of a difference compared to the other organic flour I buy because these little 2 pound bags are expensive.  It makes my pizza dough so good that my brother, the pizza connoisseur, said it was the best he had ever had.<br /><br />The bread I make is better too with Hodgson Mill Organic White Flour, but there is not enough difference in my bread to justify the cost for me.  I make lots of bread because I don't buy store bread.  I live in the boonies.<br /><br />I mention my brother's comment about the pizza dough because I have been growing my own organic produce, baking bread, drinking raw milk and more for about 4 years now making me suspect for a normal review because I am a tad more sensitive, I think, than many with the differences in food and, in particular, how food makes me feel after I eat it.<br /><br />So, yeah, dang it, it's really good.

review/summary: The Vermont difference
review/text: This syrup is delicious, 100% natural and organic, and a great deal, even when compared against Costco or other warehouse stores.  Most importantly, this is Vermont maple syrup, which is required by Vermont law to be produced with a higher level of purity and less water than maple syrup from elsewhere in the US (e.g., New York) or Canada.  Vermont maple syrup is as good as maple syrup gets, and this brand is good Vermont maple syrup.  When comparing this product against other syrups from New York or Canada, keep in mind that you're getting more syrup and less water, since Vermont maple farmers boil it down more to give you a more concentrated flavor.<br /><br />It's worth pointing out that Grade A dark amber is probably your best bet for pancakes, waffles and the like, having more flavor than the lighter Grade A syrups (light amber, fancy), and being a cleaner taste than grade B syrup.  The difference in grades and colors is based on which part of the short maple harvesting season the syrup is gathered in: Grade A dark amber comes in the heart of the season, later than the early-season lighter syrups, and before the trees are really warming up, when the baking-quality Grade B is harvested.

review/summary: Great Organic Maple Syrup
review/text: This is the first time I have tried an organic maple syrup.  Being a Grade A Dark Amber already promised great taste, but being organic added to the expectations.  The product has surpassed what I expected, with the warm, mellow taste that reminds me of northern woods, campfires, and the tingle of frost in the air.  After being raised on the authentic flavor of real maple syrup, artificial syrups are a big disappointment; this product enlivened the taste of my Saturday morning pancakes.
