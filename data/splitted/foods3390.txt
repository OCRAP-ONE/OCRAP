review/summary: Great cereal choice for the gluten intolerant
review/text: Quinoa is not only a fantastic whole grain and complete protein, it is delicious.  For those who love cereal, but are unable to eat wheat gluten, this is perfect.  The order arrived as requested, on time.  The packaging is minimal, which is a big plus for the environment and another indication of the attention to detail.  The bags are remarkable durable and the grain is fresh and wonderfully aromatic.  It has many uses and is good sweet and salty, spicy and even plain.  It is hard to find a multi purpose grain with no drawbacks I am aware of at least.  All good!

review/summary: Quinoa is Nutty (Yummy) like Barley; Sage like Ancient Vines Lost from Long Ago Times.
review/text: Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa), on a Super Saver Shipping.<br /><br />The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.<br /><br />In that maiden purchase (which included a novel, of course, Cleo Coyle's latest coffeehouse mystery, MURDER MOST FROTHY), I also added lavender and clove essential oils to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, and lavender tea.  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here.<br /><br />I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment.<br /><br />If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, "nutrition" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of "yummy.").<br /><br />Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.<br /><br />The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to "gourmet it" accordingly.<br /><br />-- As "rice" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with "noodle heaven"; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).<br /><br />-- As "oatmeal" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, creme, that type of thing.<br /><br />As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:<br /><br />- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid ( water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa.<br /><br />-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12-15 minutes.<br /><br />-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Normally, a microwave cooks 4 times faster than "outside-the-waves" cooking, but, of course that time varies with larger amounts of food.  For example, 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8 -16 minutes.<br /><br />-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (ï¿½) cup liquid.<br /><br />I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate "lid"; zap it for another minute or half, then let it "steep" in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)<br /><br />In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.<br /><br />But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate "lid" I can just place it on the table for family style "digging in."<br /><br />I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!<br /><br />Regarding having the saponin rinsed off at the "factory" like Bob's Red Mill does, I'm anxious to see how that works long term.  The price doesn't appear to be any higher (even with shipping added) than the Quinoa I've previously used from White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area.<br /><br />Even though it takes only a few minutes to rinse the saponin off the grain, that extra step can set me back from cooking Quinoa when I'm in a rush, or feeling low-energy, which is too often.  So, I was delighted when I saw that Bob's Red Mill does the pre wash.<br /><br />Regarding the saponin:<br /><br />--  The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment's, like worms or parasites.<br /><br />-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.<br /><br />-- I had a fleeting question about pre-washing: How long would the "naked" grains be able to protect themselves against parasitic invasions, once the saponin is removed.  Certainly, Quinoa (being such a strong, wise-old-grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so much longer than other similar, eons-younger food offerings.<br /><br />(Added at a later date: I relish having Quinoa pre-rinsed from Bob's Red Mill, and hope that vender continues to offer the grain that way.  I have seen no problems with parasites, even after having the grain stored in a cupboard for many months.  When given the option, I will buy Quinoa pre-washed.)<br /><br />Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Luckily for me, some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).<br /><br />Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.<br /><br />I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of "health"?<br /><br />Here's an interesting question to ponder:<br /><br />Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had "lived" long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?<br /><br />For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024CW1O">Virgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.oz</a><br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books, including:<br />Molasses Moon

review/text: This is a great source of protein if you are trying to get protein but want to avoid chloresterol.  you might find it needs a little salt but that is typical of beans.  It also reheats well in the microwave but use a cover incase they pop and make a mess. - The subscription plan is  convenient but be careful because they can really start to pile up and be a hassle if you arent using them fast enough.  It is easy to find receipies for this and hard to find in the stores.

review/summary: Delicious, nutritious, fantastic...and very easy to prepare
review/text: I provided some images of what it looks like for those who don't know and might want to try.<br /><br />Quinoa is such an easy thing to prepare.  I haven't tested it in a rice cooker and am not sure if you can but it's easy enough in a sauce pan.  2 cups of water and 1 cup of quinoa.  I'm not sure if you need to bring the water to a bowl first then add the quinoa, or if you can add all, bring to a boil, reduce heat and let it cook at medium heat...but it doesn't seem to matter as I have done it both ways.  The "all in one" shot is the easiest of course ;).  Seem pretty easy right?  Bring to a boil, let it cook at medium heat for 12 minutes, and then let it sit after you fluff it.<br /><br />To me, this has a texture that is firmer than rice, even for the folks who like their rice dry or firm.  It could just be that these grains are small and round and so give the impression of being firmer, but nonetheless, it's perfectly fine with me.  And if you are familiar, again in my own opinion, it has a texture that I can best describe as closest to caviar (this coming from a current vegan who has experienced being a carnivore previously in my younger years).  It also has pleasant a nutty flavor.<br /><br />A very healthy alternative to rice or as an addition and supplement to a healthy eating lifestyle.

review/summary: Bobs Red Mill quinoa
review/text: The price is very reasonable.  I really love my carbs, while not low carb, is definitely better than the empty and processsed stuff that I used to eat. If you're looking for a low carb option that's similar to rice, check out TVP granules. Only 3 effective carbs per serving and even easier to make than this stuff! I've really tried with efforts to eat good but I am not always a disciplined as I should be and, let me tell you, ALL of Bob's Red Mill products are money well spent. Quinoa is simple to make, versatile, and packs some nice health benefits. The package it comes in doesn't look like much but the seeds cook up to 3 times their size, easily. So a little goes a long way both in that sense and that it's pretty filling too! I use it as a side dish, in soups and stews, and I imagine that with the right ingredients it could be used for breakfast as well!

review/text: I tried Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill for the first time looking for gluten-free alternatives as well as good source of fiber. I prepared the Taboule recipe on the bag.  It is simply outstanding. It is mild in taste and takes up the complimentary flavors quite nicely. Ingredients in the Taboule are Quinoa, lemon juice, olive oil, parsley, basil, onion, salt and pepper. I can't wait to try it in other recipes or just by itself.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill products are first class. It is inappropriate not to give this product a perfect review because someone feels they can get a better price elsewhere other than Amazon.

review/text: I tried quinoa after a doctor told me it has the highest complete protein of any grain.  Bob's Red Mill is excellent, and I use it frequently in the same way I'd use rice.  By subscribing to regular delivery I am assured of always having it at the best price I can find, as well as having the reminder to use it.  I cook it by putting a 1/2 cup quinoa in a preheated wide mouth thermos and adding 1 cup of boiling water.  In a couple of hours it will be perfectly cooked and warm all day. This method makes it a favorite for camping trips.

review/text: Pros:<br /><br />- Low glycemic carbs, fiber and protein all in one!<br />- Compared to pricing on other brands this one gives you the most. Of course this can change over time. But at the time of writing this review, it had the best price.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- There is still a mild bitter taste. This is easily mitigated with a pre-wash. If you are still bothered by this I recommend Roland instead. There is absolutely no bitter taste.<br />Small tip on how long to prewash: keep washing until most of the bubbles are gone. The saponin is what gives it the bitter taste and the bubbles when you wash with water.<br />I generally put water in the pot, slosh the quinoa in the pot with my hand, pour off most of the water and repeat until most of the bubbles go away.<br /><br />2 Quick Recipe ideas:<br /><br />1. Cook along with rice in a rice cooker to add a bit of crunch to rice.<br /><br />2. Cook with chicken broth and olive oil, and afterwards garnish with olive oil roasted pine nuts, and yellow raisins, cilantro, or parsley. Can also add curry powder during cooking.<br /><br />Last tip:<br /><br />Yes you can cook this in a rice cooker.

I decided it was well worth the money to pay a little extra for already washed Quinoa. I was SOOO pleasantly surprised that my six year old daughter LOVED this stuff. NEVER has she asked for seconds on rice. She did on this. I have done everything from added cajun spices and shrimp to putting in chicken and craisins. It is incredibly versatile and has an awesome texture and taste. I recommend this product to everyone!! Plus the health benefits are reallly good, and I feel good serving it to my family.

review/summary: The Mother Grain
review/text: I discovered quinoa while in the throws of P90X.  It is indeed the mother of all grains.  Full of protein, low in cholesterol and fat, high in fiber, and great tasting, quinoa is the perfect accompaniment to all your meals.  This grain originated in South America where it was a staple of the Incas.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill Natural Foods has an extensive line of quality gluten free products, many certified organic. I have tried a wide variety of their products and I have been impressed with them all.  While they are on the pricey side, I'd rather pay a bit more for quality.  Their quinoa does not come out bitter. Cooked like rice (it can even be made in your rice maker), it is fluffy, textured (read, slightly crunchy) and nutty in flavor.  Quinoa makes a great alternative to rice or pasta.

If you are not familiar with quinoa, it is a mildly nutty-flavored, chewy and hearty grain that makes a great rice substitute.  It's pretty versatile, as you can use it to make soups and salads as well.  Bob's Red Mill products, while not cheap, are universally high quality.  With one cup of dry quinoa making enough for a side dish for 2-3 people, a 26-ounce package goes a long way. If you are a rice fan, give this product a try: I guarantee you will like it.

review/summary: Good nutrition and easy to prepare
review/text: I just received this today and started cooking with it.  I've used other brands of quinoa and Bob's is as good as any I've ever used, if not better.  The flavor is plain and you can add your own spices.  This could be used as a breakfast cereal or as a dinner side dish.  I am on a diet to avoid the white stuff - white potatoes, white rice, white pasta, and white flour because of health concerns.  This is a welcome tasty addition to my new diet.<br /><br />I cooked mine in the microwave like I do with rice, but it did not require as much time to absorb the water.  One cup quinoa with 1 cup water, and less than 10 minutes on high with cook it up nice and fluffy.  Microwaves are all different, so your timing will depend on your microwave's power.  Mine is a low 800 watt compact microwave, and like I said, it was done in less than 10 minutes.<br /><br />My local market carries Bob's products, but not this quinoa.  One small box of quinoa costs about 2 times what I paid on subscribe and save.  I've stored the unused unopened bags in my freezer for save keeping so they don't turn rancid before I use them, but I think I will be eating a lot of this, so I don't think it will have a chance to get rancid anyway.  It tends to fill you up, so a little goes a long way.

review/summary: Well done
review/text: This is quality quinoa, a perfect ingredient for gluten-free diet. Although these are pre-washed to remove the bitter taste, there's still some of it left. Not much, so you can cook these without washing, but we prefer rinsing them once for a slightly better taste. Packaging is reasonable too, although it is not resealable. (but it is cheaper this way)

review/text: Sadly I found lots of tiny stones in the batch of quinoa I received. Other than the stones that order was perfect, fast shipping, great packaging and fresh looking quinoa. But I will not be eating any more of this quinoa for fear of chipping a tooth. It's not a pleasant eating experience when every few bites you get that awful crunch from a stone.<br /><br />I'm going back to the 'Ancient Harvest' brand. I've never had such quality issues with Ancient Harvest.

review/summary: Not as washed as you might like
review/text: The quinoa itself doesn't stand out, but it isn't really bad. However, anyone who is picky about washing it beforehand may be disappointed. After reading previous reviews, I expected to be able to cook it without washing, and did so. Just as background, the bitter saponins that get washed off are also surfactants like soap, and will result in foamy water. I definitely noticed much more foaming and bubbles during cooking than with fully washed quinoa, and the result was noticeably more bitter.<br /><br />This could potentially be a batch issue, given others comments. As I received four packages, I'll test them as I use them and update my review.<br /><br />------<br /><br />Update: I've continued to use my remaining stock of this brand. Again, the taste is fine, but it definitely requires significant washing for all the bags I've had.

review/text: Quinoa is an excellent substitue for rice and pasta. The slightly 'nutty' flavor adds rather than detracts to any meal. I have used it with pasta sauces, gravies and to make stir frys. Thank goodness Bob does the washing for you! I stock up and use it more than I do brown rice because it cooks faster when I want a quick meal.

It has great quality and it arrived within 3 days of order placement, even though we didn't expect it until a week after it's arrival. It was packaged well and is rinsed thoroughly, with no random odd bits mixed in. It has good flavor and cooks up just fine, great for an alternative granola. Will definitely continue purchasing as long as it remains as reasonably priced, for my area, as it is.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: I was hooked on quinoa a couple of years ago, then migrated to the Lundberg brown rice blends for a change and stayed with them.  Someone gave me a bag of quinoa at Christmas and after preparing it I became hooked on it again.  I discovered that quinoa has twice the protein and fiber than the whole grain rice blends for around the same calories.  Also quinoa cooks in fifteen minutes as opposed to fifty minutes for the rice blends, making it a better option for the summer months.  I tried the microwave directions on the bag, attempting to cut down on electricity use and to lessen the heat in the kitchen, but it did not turn out as good as pot-prepared.  In conclusion - I'm currently doing both quinoa and rice blends, one batch of each per week, and the variety keeps things interesting.

With gas prices getting higher everyday, the shipping is reasonable.<br /><br />This 4 pack had almost a full year fresher 'sell buy' date than my upscale fresh food grocer.  This is very important.<br /> For those unfamiliar with Quinoa, the fresher it is, the sweeter the flavor.<br />It is such a healthy, energy boosting cereal in the mornings.  But also wonderful in cold salads with Greek yogurts, Feta cheese , green onions, etc.<br />Or a hot vegetable with cheese.  Add more protein in soups.  A big plus is that is GLUTEN FREE.<br />A wonderful food with endless possiblities.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: Quinoa is the most user-friendly grain I've ever found.  It cooks in the same amount of time and same liquid to solid ratio as white rice, but it has a flavor and a little crunch that's not as bland as rice.  Cook it in water or broth; add some sauteed onion and garlic or some ratatouille and it's a wonderful quick lunch.  Serve it as a bed for salmon or chicken and it's an equally delicious and fast dinner.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill Quinoa is my first experience with this ancient grain, and I'll be a fan for life.  Although I've read that quinoa should be washed before cooking to eliminate a bitter flavor, I've not had to do that with this brand.  It does have a bitey quality, but I happen to like it.  Even my meat and potatoes husband likes quinoa!

review/summary: Grit in quinoa.  Bob's Red Mill Over Charges
review/text: 5/05/2010  Update.  I am sorry but I have to down grade my review yet again.  I found grit in this quinoa for the third time while eating today.  I am shocked, I have never had this happen with quinoa before.  Very unpleasant experience to be chewing and get that awful gritty sensation and sound between your teeth.  It doesn't happen every time so I guess there are clumps of it in areas of the bag of quinoa?  Now I'm stuck with the remainder of this bag plus the three remaining bags I don't know what to do.  It's too bad because the flavor of the quinoa is really good.<br />  *********<br /><br />I am on a gluten free, vegan, nut free diet and Quinoa is a very easy way to get protein so I eat it a lot and can not afford to pay a high price for it so, originally, I was so happy to find it here at a more affordable price than at Meijer.  Quinoa is NOT cheap to buy anywhere that I can find here.  When I bought this the other day I thought that it was a good deal but was disappointed to find that I had over paid.  I will be going to Trader Joe's in future where I have found quinoa that is just as good as Bob's Red Mill and just as well washed but is over one dollar a pound cheaper.  I might try the Eden Organics brand that Amazon carries, it is almost a dollar cheaper per pound, hopefully it won't have grit like Bob's Red Mill.<br /><br /> Bob's Red Mill is really over charging on all their products.  No need to be so greedy Bob's Red Mill.  So many products they sell, like dried chickpeas and chickpea flour, I can get for half the price or less from Patel Brothers Indian Grocers.  Even Meijer has dried chickpeas for less than half the price of Bob's.  I will be canceling my Subscribe and Save on this product.

review/summary: The best...
review/text: I have an extremely healthy diet and few years ago I used to consume brown rice heavily but no longer since I discovered quinoa. This is what vegans consume instead of beef. It has all nine amino acids, organic, whole grain which is very fulfilling, vitamins, minerals, and all... Obviously it can not compete with the amino acids of the organic yoghurt that I make myself and consume but an extremely healthy product in my diet list. Cooks in five minutes then I add different dishes that I have cooked with olive oil like eggplant, onion, okra, organic beef, smoked hearings, etc. on the top and enjoy my dinner... Bob's Red Mill has the best since I never ever have to wash and rinse before cooking. I know many people do rinse but I never saw the need for it since it comes clean and that is why Bob charges more. Others claim that their quinoa is clean but it is not true. I keep the unused portion in a zip lock freezer bag in the freezer and take what I need on weekly basis. I consume so much that I never have to worry about it going rancid and unlike brown rice which looses its oil in six months and has starch and goes rancid, quinoa will go for years. Obviously I never ever do that with any food since I only purchase what I need in order to get the nutrients which a healthy diet is all about. It is great with salads as well and is gluten free. I fix very hot and spicy dishes which go great with quinoa. Bravo.

review/text: I've recently made efforts to eat better and, let me tell you, ALL of Bob's Red Mill products are a godsend. Quinoa is easy to make, versatile, and packs some serious health benefits. The package it comes in doesn't look like much but the seeds cook up to 4 times their size, easily. So a little goes a long way both in that sense and that it's pretty filling too! I use it as a side dish, in soups and stews, and I imagine that with the right ingredients it could be used for breakfast as well!<br /><br />I'm a carb addict and this, while not low carb, is definitely better than the empty and processsed carbs that I used to eat. If you're looking for a low carb option that's similar to rice, check out TVP granules. Only 3 effective carbs per serving and even easier to make than this stuff!

review/summary: Eating better is easy with this stuff
review/text: Quinoa is one of the healthiest foods you can eat, and this is a great way to buy it.  Bob's is pre-rinsed and nicely packaged for storage in the cupboard. Shipping was very prompt from coast to coast (two days). Finding quinoa in the grocery store has been difficult, and when I do find it, I have a hard time buying a little 8oz box for $5.50-ish. I prefer bulk, a reliable brand name, and super fast shipping. When ready to buy quinoa again, I will come to Amazon. Please note that the pre-rinsing factor is a big deal. If I had to do that part myself, I probably wouldn't bother with quinoa at all (the seeds are so tiny). As it is, preparing the grain is actually very fast and convenient, and I am therefore inclined to consume more of it! Highly recommend.

I put it in health bars (with pine nuts, molasses, dates, rice puffs, sesame seeds, powdered milk, almond butter, vanilla, and whatever), or cook it up just like a cereal, or put some in the bread recipe, or in the waffles.

review/text: I love this stuff.  Mild nutty flavor, chock full of good nutrition.  Try a bowl with a pat of butter, with soy sauce and honey to taste.  Also swap the honey for maple syrup (real maple syrup, not that pancake sauce they sell.  I recommend this to all.  It's actually the only hot cereal I can stand, not slimy at all, and still great for keeping you regular.

review/summary: A+++ for Quinoa
review/text: It's no wonder the Incas ate quinoa!  It's a powerhouse of healthy vitamins & minerals, high in fiber, tastes good and cooks up much faster than rice.  I am glad to keep this in stock in my kitchen, especially since it is gluten free.<br /><br />Since first reviewing this product I've seen more press on this amazing grain.  It is being touted as a superfood and rightly so.  I recommend keeping opened bags of quinoa in the refrigerator.  I had learned the grain contains oils, thus you want to be sure to keep the product chilled to be sure it doesn't become spoiled.  Enjoy this delicious and healthy grain in soups, salads, under chicken or seafood.  There are so many great uses to incorporate quinoa into a balanced diet.

review/summary: Super, Super Delicious Miso Paste
review/text: My wife and I decided that we wanted to begin having miso soup for dinner on a more regular basis, so purchased this miso paste as an essential ingredient for my miso soup recipe. I was totally impressed with the amazing taste and overall product quality. Needless to say, I am reordering and will continue to do so. I want to say that my picky kids love my Miso soup as well -- for kids that seem to only want mac & cheese, they are gorging themselves on (much healthier) miso soup now. This makes me happy. By the way, I also highly recommend the Morinu firm silken tofu and the Ajinomoto Hon Dashi Soup Stock which I both purchased from Amazon.  If interested, my Miso Soup recipe is as follows: 1 package of Morinu firm silken tofu, 2 tsp Dashi soup stock, 3 Tbs white miso paste (this stuff), 4 cups of water and 2 chopped scallions -- we also reconstitute shitake mushrooms, add dried wakame seaweed (highly recommend either Eden or Emerald Cove from Amazon as well), add shaved daikon, etc. However, this recipe is awesome just as is... We live in Northern California with some of the best Japanese restaurants in the world, but this recipe blows away (or at least equals) what you can get from any restaurant. I have also made an amazing miso salad dressing from this miso paste as well! But I digress... I highly recommend this miso paste!

review/summary: A great value and it makes a perfect miso soup!
review/text: This miso is a tremendous value and it makes a wonderful broth for miso soup.  To make a mug of miso broth, I simply boil water and add about 1 tbsp. of Maine Coast of Sea Vegetables Dulse (dried and minced) and a very generously rounded teaspoon of miso.  I pour boiling water (very warm water would work fine also) into a mug, then I use a whisk to blend the miso in the water.  It tastes outstanding, it's healthy (dulse has 330% of DV of iodine) and it really staves off hunger for a long time!  Enjoy!  Add small cubes of tofu and the chopped ends from scallions and you have an authentic miso soup.  I also found that adding a few drops of toasted sesame oil to the broth adds some "complexity" to the flavors. Don't boil the miso in the water.  It needs to be added afterward in order to maintain it's nutritional value.  This miso will last for a very long time stored in the refrigerator.  You'll probably want to put the plastic package in an airtight container.

review/summary: Great for cooking!
review/text: White miso is my favorite; its sweet qualities make it perfect for braising vegetables.  I used to purchase Miso Master and Eden white miso.  However, the cost for each was typically ten dollars for ten to sixteen ounces of product.  Since I primarily cook with miso, I was looking for bulk product that still had a good flavor profile.  I was so happy to find the Roland white miso on Amazon.  Roland white miso is flavorful and economical.<br /><br />When you order from Amazon, you get two substantial bags of miso that are each 35.3 ounces.  Once opened, Miso really doesn't go bad so I didn't fret about ordering this large quantify.  I use some types of miso less frequently, such as red miso, and from personal experience I know it can keep for over a year or more.<br /><br />As I frequently cook with my miso, I wanted to make sure that the Roland miso could be substitute for Miso Master and Eden without impacting the end flavor of my recipes.  I'm happy to report that I have not noticed any substantial flavor differences in my dishes since switching from the Eden and Miso Master brands for most of my cooking:<br /><br />Nutritionally, Roland's white miso has more calories, more fat, more sodium, and more protein than the other brands of white miso that I have used.  Here is the nutritional profile of Roland white miso:<br /><br />Serving size: 1 tablespoon<br />Servings per 35.3 oz bag: 62<br /><br />Calories: 35 per serving<br />Fat: 1 gram per serving<br />sodium: 740 mg per serving<br />Total Carbohydrates: 4 grams per serving<br />Dietary Fiber: Less than 1 gram per serving<br />Sugars: 4 grams per serving<br />Protein: 2 grams per serving<br /><br />The ingredients and prominence of certain ingredients in the Roland miso differ from the Eden and Miso Master products.  Miso Master and Eden do not put alcohol in their white miso.  Additionally, Roland uses a lot of water in the composition of its product -- water is the first ingredient.  In the Eden product, rice is the first ingredient.  In the Miso Master product, soybeans are the first ingredient.<br /><br />Ingredients: Water, soybeans, rice, salt, alcohol.<br /><br />If you are looking for a white miso with less sodium, Eden's white miso has 330 mg. per tablespoon.  Miso Master has about 540 mg. of sodium per tablespoon.<br /><br />For cooking, this product has served me well. Health wise, it may fall behind other white miso brands out there but for my purposes it works well.<br /><br />This product is made in Japan.

I'm a miso noob, so I don't have a lot to say beyond that. :D<br /><br />UPDATE: I wasn't sure how white miso is supposed to look, but I've been checking out images online, and what I got is a dark red color, despite the packaging claim that it is white. It doesn't look anything like the white miso images I've seen (light yellow color). Is it spoiled? I called Amazon and they are going to send me a replacement. I'll update again, when I receive it.

review/text: Ordered from Amazon because product unavailable at local market. Had a great recipe which called for 6 Tbs of White Miso. Never used miso before, so I ordered this mainly because of the reviews. Excellent product. Recipe came out perfect. However, this is really a lot of miso!! Six Tbs didn't even make a dent in it. Not being familiar with miso, I didn't know what approximated the amount I actually needed. When I received the package, I really had to laugh at myself. What will I do with all this miso? Well, now I'm exploring miso soup, miso fish, etc. Quite a useful (and tasty) product. When the time comes, I'll buy more!!!

review/text: As a long-time green tea (and coffee) drinker, I was much pleased with this Genmaicha Tea.  The brown rice is roasted sufficiently and in sufficient quantity to give a nice balance to the green tea, both sharpening the flavor while sweetening it a bit.  But don't get confused: it is not a "sweet" tea.  The brown rice gives the tea a sense of "hops" as one would find in a quality brown beer.  If you are a fan of the style of Genmaicha tea, I heartily recommend trying this brand.  I'll be back for more!

review/text: Since I'm from Michigan and quite familiar with Biggby coffee shops, this review may be a bit biased. Biggby's Michigan Cherry is my absolute favorite coffee. It has a nice aroma and just enough of a hint of black cherry to give it a flavorful yet full-bodied taste. The cherry flavor is by no means over-powering but it provides a unique flavor that makes drinking a cup of this coffee enjoyable. As an added bonus, it doesn't taste too bad once it has cooled off and makes a good iced coffee. I would definitely recommend trying Biggby's Michigan Cherry and, thanks to Amazon, you don't have to live in Michigan to enjoy it.

review/text: This Imagine Organic Vine Ripened Tomato Soup is really delicious!  It actually does taste like the tomatoes were just picked and canned.  There are a few, though not as many as I had hoped, of solid tomato pieces amoungst the tomato soup base.  The picture of the can makes one think there are chunks and chunks of solid tomato pieces but that's not the reality!  The acidity tastes low and the sodium level (1220mg/can) doesn't over whelm the taste buds either.  And it's ORGANIC.  The sixth item on the ingredients list is 'evaporated cane juice'  which is a shame because, for this reason alone, I will not be buying this item as often as I would normally.  I still don't know why manufacturers haven't figured out that ECJ is BAD for one's health!!!  But despite the flaws, this is a very flavorful tomato soup.

review/summary: My Cat Went BERSERK When I Opened These
review/text: Our cat is pretty picky.  He eats a raw handmade dinner at night and a high quality dry food with water in the morning.  He is an outdoor cat.  When I get something new to give him, he often will look at me partially interested and then take a sniff or a lick and want to go outside.<br /><br />When our cat is hot, he often is not very interested in food.  He flops down and complains all day when it is hot, but does not like much of anything- food included.  The day I got my package of these treats in the mail, our cat was flopping underneath some planters on the porch.  He was not overly interested in me when I came out the door, other than to give me a tiny "Mew" to let me know he was there.<br /><br />I walked over to him with the box of sealed treats and told him I had a treat for him.  He began to sniff the air.  He almost never does that- especially with a sealed bag in a box!  I opened the box and then struggled with the bag as the peel off top which leads to a zip lock back inside did not come complete off.  The cat jumped on my leg and began to help me open the bag.  Clearly he was interested.<br /><br />Then I finally managed to get the bag open, and I broke one of the thick cakes of treat in half and held it up to him.  He leaped in the air and grabbed it with his paws like hands, and forced it on the ground where he held it in place with both hands and claws.  He held it and chewed on it with passion until it was all gone.  He even licked little crumbs up off the floor, something he almost never does.<br /><br />I decided to give him the other half and told him that it was all he would get.  He jumped in the air and begged until he got the cake from me.  He did things he rarely does when I offer him anything to eat.  Then he polished off that too.  When he was done, he went back to being the ultimate cool cat and adopting his sense of boredom at my existence he went back to flopping under the planter.<br /><br />These treats smell delicious, stay fresh in the bag, and I have to say that these treats bring about such a passion and excitement in our cat that he gets all happy and really into the process of eating a treat, licking it all up until it is gone.  I rarely see him get this excited over any food item except his homemade dinner at night.  I can not recommend these highly enough.  I am thinking these will be a regular feature at our house from this point on!

review/summary: Anyone remember dissecting owl pellets in grade-school?
review/text: That was my first impression of these treats out of the bag...  dried up owl pellets (yick).  Not that appearances matter all that much if your pet loves the taste but these are big treats and for my small sized dog, that meant I had to break it apart with my hands which was a touch bit unpleasant for moi.<br /><br />As for my dog, he simply didn't care for these at all.  I really wanted him to like them since he turns his nose up to nearly every treat imaginable (including bits of people food, which I don't consider a bad thing) and I'm always looking for ways to create a little variety for him.  Aside from his dog food, the only treats I've found he likes are the soft/chewy Buddy Treats in chicken flavor and dried chicken cutlets (kind of like chicken jerky) which I stopped giving him after an incident last year where he nearly choked on one.<br /><br />I thought these might have been a good replacement for the dried chicken cutlets that he liked so much because I assumed that these would primarily contain one ingredient (chicken) that had been formed into easier to chew treats.  Of course, this is in part my fault for making such an assumption but I'd like to point out there wasn't and currently isn't an ingredient listing available on this product.  The closest reference to what these treats contain are in the following descriptions "Your dog's instinctive nature is to eat more meat, poultry, or fish protein and less grain... Instinct Raw Boost Bites are grain-free and gluten-free - perfect for satisfying your dog's carnivorous cravings and nutritional needs...  Raw Boost Bites are a pure and healthy treat made from minimally processed, freeze dried raw ingredients..."  For those of you who may be interested, here is the actual ingredient listing in order as they appear:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkinseeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flaxseeds, Montmorillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin, Sage, Clove.<br /><br />Looks like they're really trying to appeal to a 'natural/holistic' audience and I for one am okay with that - in fact, I try and avoid treats for my dog (and myself!) that contain ingredients I don't know to be 'real' however... had I known these to be the ingredients up front, I'd probably have passed knowing that my dog already turns his nose up to the following food items (turkey, apples, carrots, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, blueberries or persimmons).  There are also quite a few ingredients that I never thought about seeing if my dog would enjoy as well as a few 'questionable to me' ingredients (cloves??)<br /><br />I gave this at least three stars because the ingredient list isn't bad per se, but they should update their product description to include this information and although my dog didn't care for them and I couldn't coax him into a second bite - he did manage to eat a first bite after lots of encouragement.  That's a pretty big deal coming from a dog with as fickle a palate as his.

review/summary: 4 Out of 4 Dogs Enthusiastically Approve
review/text: OK, I have to say this is an expensive doggie treat, but my dogs practically steamroll one another to get to the treats. The circular disks of freeze dried chicken are rather big- bigger than a silver dollar and more than a half inch thick. They are very light because of the nature of the treat, and the dogs practically inhale them despite their size. I have 4 dogs and one is somewhat picky, but they all love these treats.<br /><br />There are under 20 treats in the package, so for $10-13 per package and with 4 dogs, they get about 4 treats a piece per package. And since these are treats, not bones, they don't last very long. I think these might be the "Doggie Christmas Stocking" type treat for special occasions, not an everyday treat due to the expense. But nonetheless, the dogs LOVE them!<br /><br />**4 stars due to price, but product gets 5 stars!

review/summary: Great ingredients, dog can't resist!
review/text: My dog is getting a little picky in her "old age" and doesn't usually like treats anymore.  The Natures Variety Raw Boost Bites though, she couldn't resist.  I actually caught her trying to get the bag open after it was left on the ground by the kids!  I love that you can actually read the ingredient list.  First several ingredients include Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkinseeds, Apples, Carrots... the rest of the list is just as great.  Only ingredients that aren't "real food" are Montmorillonite Clay and Mixed Tocopherols with Citric Acid (a natural perservative)<br /><br />Great for pets with allergy problems!

review/summary: Strange stuff, but the finicky cat likes it.
review/text: I don't know what I was expecting with these, but I guess I was thinking the "bites" would be cat-sized, not Great Dane-sized. The "bites" are about 1.75" in diameter and look like miniature hamburger patties. They are very light weight and are easy to break into pieces.<br /><br />We've got two cats, the finicky one, and the one who will eat anything.<br /><br />After breaking one piece into about 5 smaller chunks, I gave a chunk to each cat and was pleasantly surprised to see them both eating them, and actually chewing - they usually inhale smaller treats, so it's nice to see them actually put their teeth to use!<br /><br />I'll definitely continue to purchase these, as it's tough for me to find anything the finicky cat will eat, I just wish they came in a smaller size.<br /><br />I've added some images of the product so you can actually see what you are getting. This 4-ounce package contained about 18 pieces.

review/summary: Large and awkward size for cats, might be better for dogs
review/text: Another reviewer said these looked like "hairballs that have been compressed into cookie shapes", and aside from the color, I'd have to agree.  Each bite is far too large for an ordinary house cat, and the directions say "Treat your pet with 1 to 2 Boost Bites per day per 20 lb of body weight."  My cat weighs much less than 20 pounds, so I cut one of these up into quarters.<br /><br />Well, I tried, anyway.  They don't cut, they crumble.  They seem to have a texture like a fibrous insulation I'd used for soundproofing.  I picked a piece out of the crumbs and dust and fed it to my cat.  He swatted at it a few times then swallowed it whole, even though it was twice as large as his usual treats, which he normally chews.  He wasn't interested in more.  I scooped together a pile of crumbs, added a couple of drops of water, and molded them into a lump.  Wet, he loved it, first chewing up the lump then snuffling up the escaped crumbs.  Right now he's trying to convince me that more testing is needed.<br /><br />The packaging hints at mysterious and wonderful benefits, but I'm a bit doubtful.  It suggests:<br /><br />"Instinct Raw Boost Bites may help promote:<br />*Vitality & energy<br />*Digestive health<br />*Lean muscles<br />Give your pets Instinct Raw Boost Bites and boost their health with the purity of raw food."<br /><br />The raw ingredients, after chicken and turkey parts, include fruits, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, montmorillonite clay, lettuce and spinach, and dried kelp and sprouts, among other things.  The package goes on to claim:<br /><br />"Our purpose is to empower people to transform the lives of pets.  Freedom from allergies, improved skin & coat, weight loss, reduced incidence of ear infections, and healthier teeth and gums are just a handful of the amazing pet transformations that Nature's Variety customers experience."<br /><br />If there's an amazing pet transformation I'll update my review.  Personally, I'm hoping for an amphibious vehicle, but I'll settle for a dog.<br /><br />These are too large and messy, they require added water to really get the cat interested, and this is a pretty hefty price tag for high maintenance treats, but he does seem to like them once they're wet.

review/text: These are dry but not hard, slightly crumbly, small cookie-sized treats. When my husband is having a cookie, he gives one of these to the dog rather than the people cookies he shared with her previously. She doesn't feel deprived, and her health and our vet thank him!

review/summary: My Cats Love These
review/text: We have 3 cats and 2 will eat almost any treat, but one is very picky. It was around noon, so my one cat was  in the kitchen, looking for "lunch". I had just fed them an hour earlier, so there was no way I was opening another can of food.  I thought this would be a good time to try out the New Raw Boost Bites.<br />I took one of the pieces (they are quite big and look like a bite-size cookie) and broke it into smaller sizes. For dogs, I imagine you would not have to do this.<br />Well, they gobbled it right up! I had to break apart another for them right away. Then satisfied, they forget all about lunch and went to go relax. I guess these are a satisfying enough treat to tide them over until dinner.<br />Knowing these are not only tasty (at least from watching them eat them) but also good for them makes me feel good about feeding them to my cats.  You get about 18 in a pack, so I will be saving them for rewards or special treats.

review/summary: Strange treat
review/text: This was listed as a cat treat. On the package it is stated to be for cats and dogs. I got them for my cats and thought it strange that the treat itself was the size of an oreo cookie. It is kind of crumbly like a stale cookie, but filled with real ingrediants like chicken and turkey. I had to crumble it into bite size pieces for my cats. They did eat it, but were less than enthusiastic. They prefer Temptations treats apparently. This would probably work better as a treat for dogs.

review/summary: Both cats liked them
review/text: I have used this brand for my cats and they have liked it (different flavors of wet food including rabbit and duck). When it comes to treats, my two cats tend to have different taste. I got them these treats and they both liked them. The treats are about the size of a chicken nugget but they are very light and almost crumbly. They smell fishy to me but they are chicken. The directions say they are treats for dogs and cats and to give 1-2 for each 20 pounds. Since my cats are about 10lbs each I decided to split 1 between the two.<br />I have had a good experience with this brand and I recommend it.

review/summary: Our Dogs Love Them
review/text: We have two dogs, a chihuahua and a beagle.  Both of them love the Boost Bites Treats.  As soon as they see the bag, they come running for their "cookie".  The treats are shaped like little cookies and are light brown in color so they actually look like gingersnaps.<br />The nutrition data and info on the label is impressive regarding how these treats can help your dog's digestion and provide other health benefits.  That's always nice to know - that you're giving your furry babies something that they love and it's good for them as well.  The treats are pretty soft so easy to chew for both dogs although I have to break up the one that the chihuahua gets - the cookie is a bit too big for her mouth.  Overall, I think this is a wonderful product to pamper a beloved pet.

review/summary: Probably better for cats and small dogs
review/text: For those who like are feeding their dogs the raw food diet, these bites may something you could use for treats.<br /><br />There's nothing artificial in the ingredients. As listed on the box: chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkinseeds, apples, carrots, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, ground flaxseeds, montmorillonite clay, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, dried kelp, apple cider, vinegar, parsley, honey, salmon oil, olive oil, mixed tocopherols with citric acid, rosemary, blueberries, alfalfa sprouts, persimmons, inulin, sage, and clove.<br /><br />This treat is labeled for dogs and cats but I have large dogs (80+ pound Labs) and these treats were finished in less than 5 seconds. For large dogs, I think this may work out better as a training treat - they are easy to break into pieces.<br /><br />There are 18 in a package, about the size of a silver dollar, and about 1/2 inch thick. They have the  consistency of freeze dried food and were very quickly eaten by my Labs.  All loved it but for the size of my dogs, it's an expensive treat.

review/text: I have a box of Milk Bone flavor snacks, a box of Beneful Baked Delights and one of Raw Boost Bites, lets see how they stack up with the first few ingredients.<br /><br />Milk Bone: Wheat flour, wheat bran, wheat and bone meal, poultry by-products, beef fat, wheat germ, salt---and then a list of ingredients that no one can pronounce.<br /><br />Beneful: Wheat flour, ground corn, glycerin, sugar, corn gluten, water, chicken by-product, preserved animal fat----and then to the food color dye etc...<br /><br />Raw Boost:  Chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkin seed, apples, carrots, butternut squash, flax-seed, montmorillonite clay, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, dried kelp, vinegar, parsley, salmon oil, citric acid, rosemary, blueberries etc.  No food color, preservatives that are difficult to pronounce.  They are made by a small company in NE that obviously care about the health of our pets.<br /><br />Another interesting comparison is the amount moisture and protein.  Milk Bone: 12% moisture, 15% protein.<br />  Beneful: 20% moisture, 14% protein.<br />  Raw Boost:  4% moisture 40% protein.<br /><br />Rather interesting I thought, we usually don't have time to check out what's in our pets food at the store, always in a hurry.  I just thought you might like look at this too.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the treats!  We have two min. schnauzers who always love their "goodies"----and they are rather picky about their food.  The Raw Boost Bites passed with flying colors, so I (with tongue in cheek) think these are the ones that picky pets would choose.<br /><br />Would recommend this product to any pet lover.

review/summary: Tasty but expensive freeze dried pet treats
review/text: My dog is a 62lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially food allergies. He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his treats so finding the right mix can often be difficult. I always have reservations about trying new treats as a large majority of popular dog treats today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new treats so here are my thoughts on Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ High in protein, 40%.<br /><br />+ Minimally processed and freeze dried raw ingredients.<br /><br />+ Dog loved them.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Expensive.  $10 for four ounces is a lot.<br /><br />- High in fat, 34%.<br /><br />- Messy and crumbly texture.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats.  Despite being extremely high in fat content the freeze dried raw ingredients are quite healthy compared to many of treats on the market.  Unfortunately, the high price tag on these treats would make me hesitant about purchasing them on a regular basis.

review/summary: My Cat and I Share a RAW FOOD Diet
review/text: NATURE'S VARIETY INSTINCT RAW BOOST BITES FREEZE-DRIED TREATS (aka "Boost Bites") provides a little treat for my cat, that isnt the JUNK FOOD normally found in name brand cat treats. The Friskies cat treats contain Brewers Rice, chicken meal, corn meal, animal fat, animal liver, malt, artificial flavors, brewers yeast, and a chemistry lab of various preservatives, and artificial colors.<br /><br /> Compare that to the RAW ingrediants of BOOST BITES: Chicken, Turkey, Turkey liver and heart, Pumpkin Seeds, Apples, Carrots, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, ground flaxseed, clay (for natural vitamins), broccoli, lettuce, spinach, kelp, vinegar, parsley, honey, salmon oil, olive oil, Vitamin E, Rosemary, blueberries, Alfalfa sprouts, permissons, sage, and clove.<br /><br />The BOOST BITES are a RAW FOOD. For years I've been eating a raw food diet for dinner, consisting of MUESLI. Muesli was invented by a Swiss doctor, consisting of various raw grains, dried fruit, and unbaked seeds and nuts, soaked in soy milk. The concept behind raw foods, is that cooking destroys the enzymes in food, as well as many vitamins, which our body requires. If I'm going to eat a raw diet for my health, I might as well share that benefit with my cat. Our pets arent that different than us, and i'm NOT anthopomorphizing. They require these raw enzymes just like we do, and our pets are healthier with them. If I didnt believe in the health benefits of raw food, I wouldnt spend the extra money for Muesli.<br /><br />Needless to say, a raw food diet means nothing to my cat. He eats Boost Bites cos he thinks they taste great. In fact, I gave him a taste test, placing a bit of BOOST BITES, next to his Friskies treats. He goobled down the Boost Bites, and left the Friskies Treats lay there untouched. (Tho he ate those too, when he figured out he wasnt getting more Boost Bites.)These cost a bit more than the treats from the grocery store, but they are his vitamin suppliment. Along with the EFA fish oil capsels I squeeze on his food, my cat's recieving an excellent diet. His digestion is good, and his coat doesnt flake off all this excessive dander, that used to cause him to scratch himself raw. A healthy cat is a happy cat. And a happy cat, is a happy cat owner.

review/summary: Three cats said Neooooooow
review/text: I sure liked the ingredients, the description and even the smell of these treats. But my three cats weren't even intrigued enough to taste them, so regretfully they have given these treats one star. The treats are really large and probably more suitable for a dog. Of course, I broke the treats up into manageable sizes for cats, still no luck. Well, cats are known to be finicky and mine are no exception. One day they love something and the next day they could not care less. I will give the remainder of these treats to my daughter who has three dogs and will update my review if, in fact, they shed a different light on Raw Boost Bites.
