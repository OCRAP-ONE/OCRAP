review/summary: Misleading on size/price
review/text: I ordered three bags, not realizing they were 4 lb. bags.  The add made me think it was a 33# bag because the price of 50 something dollars was slashed through like this was some big sale.  I fell for it, but you can believe I will be a lot more careful in the future.  I have bought quite a bit from Amazon and it makes me unhappy that they would let this go on.  If someone would mislead on size/price, what else would they mislead you on.

review/summary: Misleading pricing -Beware!
review/text: The seller claims that they give huge discount on the over 50$ item. However if you look closely they sell the smallest package (4 Lb) at a typical retail price(around 10$). The largest bag of the brand typically cost around 55$ not the small one!<br />Such prectice of traiding partners poorely reflects on Amazon's brand.

review/summary: It used to be good but not anymore!
review/text: UPDATE!<br />My guess is Natural Balance has recently changed their Chicken & Pea L.I.D (Limited Ingredient Diet) formula, or their factory has been using different replacement or substandard ingredients! I have been feeding the Chicken & Pea L.I.D to my cats for months now & they have been doing great off of it as you can see from my previous review on this product. Then, in mid February 2012, I opened a new bag for my cats and the coloring of the crunchies were a much darker color than they used to be & my cats wouldn't even eat it! So I went and purchased a new bag from a different store to see if the 1st bag was just a bad batch & this time the crunchies looked normal, however within a week, one of my cats got blood covered stool (which took 3 months to go away!), and my cat with the sensitive stomach started acting mopey & sick. After 2 weeks he would barely walk around. Several tests later the vet found that his intestines were swollen along with his stomach lymph nodes & he had developed pancreatitis. He's off the food now but still recouping. Apparently my cat isn't the only one with problems recently with the Limited Ingredient dry crunchies according to reviews on consumeraffairs.com! Customers on there have the same complaints with the cat & dog dry L.I.D food over the past few months of it doing the same thing to their animals too! Natural Balance doesn't have my business any more, that is until they no longer have Diamond Pet Foods package their products. After doing some background research on Natural Balance, Diamond Pet Foods (who packages for them) has constant recalls & complaints. They have one going on right now actually & were one of the biggest culprits during the 2007 major pet food recall.  Just keep an eye on your pets if you purchase this, and also watch for a runny nose or sneezing, my cat no longer does either since taking him off of this food.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />Five Stars!!!! One of my cats has a very sensitive stomach but does VERY well on these crunchies! And my other cat had bad dandruff but after a couple of months on this food its completely gone! Her coat looks beautiful and she doesn't frantically lick her back anymore! Both of my cats seemed to prefer this flavor over the salmon L.I.D but all cats are different. So glad Natural Balance makes this!

review/text: My kitty has IBS and we had to take her to the vet to get special food for her to eat. Well, she downright refused the prescription food. So, the vet recommended that we try a few different limited ingredient food brands until we found one that she would eat. And....BINGO, this was it. It is great for her sensitive stomach and she just loves the food. Her coat condition has also improved. Great product.

review/summary: So glad I tried this food-cat allergy problem improving
review/text: My 12 year old cat has been suffering a skin allergy that began last January. After hundreds of dollars, half a dozen prescriptions, skin scrapings, blood work, several injections we found this food. Her next step was either a biopsy ($400) or a trip to the veterinary allergist ($1000) First I decided to do an 8 week food trial to rule out food allergy. After pricing the food the Vet wanted to put her on at $43 for a 6 pound bag, I decided to do some research. I looked at food ratings, ingredients, customer reviews. I came across this food & decided to give it a try. After 2 weeks her hair is growing back. The "lesions" she had are healing and no more scratching them open. Her coat looks great & she even looks like she is slimmimg down. It stands to reason that cats should be fed meat, not corn and fillers. What a relief.

review/text: I've been feeding my little guys Natural Balance for a while now and they love it. Their coats have never been shinier and meal time is always a breeze. They're not huge fans of NB's wet food, but the dry is at the top of their list. I love the fact that it's grain-free and the price is very good for what you get. A 10-lb bag usually lasts me about a month since I mix it with wet food. Definitely worth it for your furry friend.

review/summary: The Only Solution for my Cat's Sensitive Stomach
review/text: I adopted a kitten last year, and from at the start, he had a sensitive stomach.  I feed all my cats high quality food, and tried a couple different kids, but nothing seemed to work.  Everything ended up in the litter box in a extremely less than solid form and smelled like toxic waste.  I finally tried Natural Balance Green Pea and Chicken, and got amazing results.  I tried the Green Pea and Duck kind, and things regressed, but as I switched back to the Green Pea and Chicken we were good again.  I'm never going to feed him anything else!

He had a cat with a grain allergy and had good success with the Limited Ingredient Diet.  Within a few day of using this, my kitten was able to keep his food down and started putting on weight.  Now, several months later he is healthy, has put on weight,his hair is beautiful and he has lots of energy.  I think this food saved his life.  My other cat who doesn't have any issues likes it and looks great, too.

review/summary: Terrific for my fish-allergic cat
review/text: Who'd think a cat would be allergic to fish???  That's what I thought when my vet suggested the idea about our orange tiger, who was suffering from a persistent redness to his stomach and gums.  But after experimenting with different types of food to pinpoint the allergen, fish looked like the culprit.  Thus the search for fish-free dry food, which was a LOT more difficult than I'd imagined.  Many (most?) of the grain-free varieties, even those labeled "beef," "chicken," "turkey," etc., still contained fish meal or fish oil, so you usually need a "Limited Ingredients Diet" food.  I like Natural Balance because (1) the cats like it (good reason); (2) they have at least two flavors, green pea/chicken, and green pea/duck; and (3) for a "premium" brand, it's still reasonably priced.  FYI, for those who have fish-allergic cats, for dry food I've found Natural Balance, Holistic (duck), Basics by Blue Buffalo, and Instinct (turkey) -- out of those, our cats have liked the NB the best.  Love to hear if anyone has any other fish-free dry food recommendations.

review/summary: Wanted to try something new, but eh...
review/text: We are very careful about which foods we buy anymore, avoiding anything with grain in it.<br />Cats don't eat grains in their diet on any regular basis, but it is a cheap filler for many<br />manufacturers of pet foods. We found that our male cat gets itchy hot spots is he eats<br />corn or wheat, so we look for things without that.<br /><br />We normally buy Blue Buffalo, but I was looking for another type of healthy food that we could<br />use for their treat balls <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CG40O">PetSafe SlimCat Food Distributor Ball, Blue</a>.<br />(We used to feed them Temptations, which they go crazy for, but also makes our male cat very itchy.)<br /><br />Thought we'd try this. I thought the pea protein was a little weird, but male cat loves peas already,<br />so why not. Chicken is the preferred flavor by both cats (neither of whom like fish flavors. It's really<br />a stereotype that cats and fish are a dream team!), so this should work out well.<br /><br />I should have looked for a smaller bag to give this one a try! Geesh - it's large. I am used to cat foods<br />being packaged in a more verticle-oriented package. This one is large and flat, more like dry dog food<br />packaging.<br /><br />Both cats were very interested as soon as I took it out of the shipping box (of course, they<br />think every box coming in to the house is surely something wonderful for them anyway!).<br />I cut the top open, and fed them a handful. It was inhaled! While I am not overly impressed with the<br />ingredients (they could do a lot better), it isn't the worst by a long shot, and I don't think it will<br />bother either cat. If it does, I'll come back and update my review.<br />Would I buy it again?  Maybe - but right now, I have three gallon-size zipper bags full of it, so it'll be<br />a while! Glad they like it! Otherwise the strays would be eating really well around here! Ha!<br />Not horrible, cats both like it, not full of grain meals, not much smell at all to it, and the pieces<br />are a really nice size/shape for cats. They look like a pencil eraser cut in half horizontally! : )<br /><br />Update as of May 20:  Neither cat is very impressed. They don't really care one way or the other over this one.<br />One kitty has a lot of tummy bloating with it, so not sure what to think, except that this was my first and last purchase<br />of this particular product. I'll stick with Blue Buffalo.

review/summary: Buy it!
review/text: Ok so in case you didn't know, the regular price for a 5 pound bag of this stuff at most petstores is around $16. For just $4 more, you're getting twice as much on Amazon. And it's Prime eligible which makes it an even better deal.<br /><br />Moving on to food quality. I had recently considered switching my cat over to Blue Buffalo, which I know is a better food, so I bought a small bag to test it out. I poured her Natural Balance in one bowl and Blue Buffalo in the other and to my surprise, she ignored the BB and continued to eat NB. So now I know that she actually likes it and prefers it over other foods, so I will be sticking with this brand and variety instead of paying more for other foods. The fact that NB offers several grain free varieties at reasonable prices and doesn't have by-products in its ingredients is awesome. I just feel a little uncomfortable because I think green pea is listed as the first ingredient on this, but my cat's never had any problems with this food and it smells a lot better to my nose than most foods out there, so I don't see any reason to switch. I would highly recommend the Alpha Cat grain free variety as well, but its a little pricier, so look out for it when its on sale at your nearby pet store.

review/summary: Perfect food for my spoiled pets
review/text: I started looking into pet foods when I read about people having pets with crystals blocking their urine. Although I'm far from an expert, I started reading that people believed the crystals were formed based on what their pets were eating. This sent me on a search for a different type of pet food, one that was natural and not full of fillers that my cats don't need. Although this brand seems expensive, it lasts just as long as the cheap brands because it's full of protein and my cats eat way less. So, in the long run, my cats are eating food that is much better for them and it costs about the same as running through cheaper brands. My cats love the taste of this, too.

review/text: My cats are both more than 13 years old. As they have gotten older, their tummies seem to have become more "delicate." After doing some research, I decided to try Natural Balance. The difference it has made in them has been amazing. Their coats are shiny and lush -- I'd even say they shed less -- and the cat who had a skin condition like dandruff no longer suffers from that. It took a bit of time for them to get used to the food, of course; I had to mix it in with their old food for about a week. Now, if I happen to run out and have to give them cheaper food, their turn up their noses at it. Fortunately, with Amazon Prime, I can order one day and have their food here the next.

review/summary: Fewer ickies to clean! Happier, (fatter- oops) healthier cats.
review/text: One of three cats had chronic diarrhea and vomiting. The vet recommended switching to a grain free product, and Natural Balance made a HUGE difference. Lucy is "regular" again for the first time in probably three years after many failed prescriptions from another vet. All three cats are puking much much less! Let's face it, sometimes they just do it for sport, but we can go a week without somekitty hurling, and that's major! The food may have higher calorie content- only one of the cats needed to gain weight, but all three have! That can easily be adjusted in portions served, however. I highly recommend this project. All cats are happier, more energetic, healthier, and have less behaviors. It would be awesome if I could put it on auto ship like you can with some other products, because sometimes I don't order it in time. It is a little pricey, but it's worth it to have less messes to clean up and healthier cats. P.S. We've tried all flavors, with similar results, although chicken seems to be their favorite.

review/summary: Healthy & Satisfying
review/text: Natural Balance dry food is an excellent, healthy choice.  All four of my cats (two male, two female) love it, and I am very comfortable with the healthy, limited ingredients. My one male cat has had urinary tract problems in the past, so we are very careful to choose excellent wet and dry foods.  The one wet food we like is also Natural Balance (low ash, low magnesium, high protein), and they love it; the other is Innova.  I've recently ordered the Natural Balance dry food in Salmon (grain free also).  I have no doubt they will love that too!

review/summary: Big mistake
review/text: My cat, who has been on a gluten-free all-canned diet for a few years, did not like this food.  I got her to eat maybe two tablespoons over the course of two days and that was all it took to wreak havoc with her system.  I bought the food based on my complete satisfaction with the same brand of canned food and also because I would like to be able to feed dry food in addition to canned.  I thought my cat would appreciate some variety as would I.  So here I am wide awake at 3 am laundering sheets because immediately after a near liquid litter box episode she bee-lined it for my bed.  Obviously this food is a huge success in some households and I wish more than anyone that my experience was positive too.  But considering my lost night's sleep, the total waste of money, and the negative impact on my cat's health, what other rating can I give this product?  I rate based on my own experience and this purchase was disastrous for me and my cat so I give one star.

review/text: Recently had these at a holiday party and FINALLY found the person who offered them to find out the name.  ALL of my friends raved about them.  While they still have pits, they are so buttery the meat slips off the pit quite easily while continuing to feel like butter in your mouth.  I generally like olives that have more tooth to them (black olives) but these are really special.  I don't know how I would use them in a dish...these were part of a holiday pick-up buffet and were a perfect as a snack and go.  I will seek these out and give them to friends as gifts because they are very unique in taste and texture and everyone seemed to like them!

review/summary: MARVELOUS!!!
review/text: Graber's Ripe Green Olives are marvelous, and utterly unlike any other type of olives.  Although packed in a light brine, they are not salty nor vinegary.  Instead, they are mild, buttery and nutty.  Really!  They are perfect for a snack or light meal with mild complex cheeses, pear slices, etc.<br /><br />$6.49 is a fair price, but $7.25 for shipping (the price at the time this review is written) more than doubles your cost.  Alternatively, you can buy them by the case (as few as 4 cans) directly from the Graber Olive House, but even so, the shipping cost is prohibitive for folks on the East Coast.  If that doesn't discourage you, then go all in and buy the larger size 16 olives.<br /><br />Grabers olives are unpitted, and (as with all olives) are far tastier than pitted olives.  Strangely, PITTED ripe green olives are readily available at reasonable prices (even at many ordinary grocery stores), but do not compare to Grabers unpitted olives.  You can probably buy 6 cans of pitted ripe green olives for the price of 1 can of Grabers.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SXXJMK">Santa Barbara Olive Co. California Green Medium Pitted Ripe Olives, 6 Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BW45Q8">Lindsay Olives Green Ripe Medium Pitted, 6-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />If you are already familiar with ripe green olives but not Grabers--Grabers is simply the Rolls Royce of ripe green olives.<br /><br />PROBLEM<br />The only problem with Graber's olives is "you can't eat just one".  If I open a can, I finish it within an hour.<br /><br />Recommendation: After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it. Or, at least when you buy something from your wishlist that you'll probably buy regularly, make a note of the price you paid

review/summary: Good Quality "canned olives" but not that agreeable about the price
review/text: - The appearance of the Olives are high in quality and you can tell that<br />  "Grabers" was very selective in the olives that were being canned.<br />- The Olives are unpitted.<br />- The taste is a lot like the black olives that you would find in a grocery store<br />  with somewhat of a more buttery taste.<br />- The texture of the olives is not as firm as the canned black olives but softer<br />  (in a good way) but not mushy.<br /><br /> Having said this, I think they are a bit overpriced (especially if you are paying for shipping) and I wouldn't buy a second can for $12.99... but that's just me. Some "personally" may really like them enough to get them because they are not common in Grocery Stores but I buy a lot of olives and have tried many varieties from brined to oil cured and from different countries and honestly, to me, these taste just like the common canned black olives.

He is a glory hound who was banned from the society when he boldly renounced the word "zest" when describing processed meat goods.<br /><br />When I am searching for a flavor to perfectly compliment the woodsy zing of a fresh stick of fish, these olives are the finest.

It contains no gluten, it is quite filling, and it is completely portable!  I've just ordered my second batch of the plain kind, and I also ordered the maple type as well.  If you are gluten intolerant, and you do not have a nut restriction, this is the best thing out there when traveling!!!!!

I love the almond butter, and hope at some point they will make it certified organic.

review/summary: quick, convenient packs of protein
review/text: I was recently diagnosed with hypoglycemia and was instructed to eat little protein snacks every 2-3 hours.  These little packs are PERFECT for keeping in my purse, backpack, desk drawer for a quick snack when my home fridge is not accessible.  These have saved me on my weekend treks around town.<br /><br />These have no added sugar or salt, which is perfect for me as well.  Some who've been raised on traditional peanutbutters (Jif, Skippy) will probably find this "difficult to swallow" at first (my Dad said he thought it tastes rancid!).  But for those of us who are accustomed to no added sugars and salts in our nut butters, these have good flavor.<br /><br />I would prefer to have RAW almond butter, which I typically purchase in large jars, but Justin's makes only roasted nut butters (hence the 4 stars instead of 5).<br /><br />If you're looking for economy, buy the jars of Justin's nut butters.  If you're looking for convenience and quick snacks, these packets are the way to go.  And the price offered on Amazon is MUCH CHEAPER than the local stores.

review/text: Timing was right for the arrival of my first order of ALMOND BUTTER packets.  I am usually munching on nuts and dried fruit from breakfast to before bed snacking, but I am now recovering from oral surgery and nuts and dried fruit are the last think I want between my teeth right about now. I am bored with soft foods and soups and chowders and baked potatoes and miss my nutty snacks.  My nut butters have arrived and I just enjoyed squeezing the soft, slippery, gooey confection onto my finger and remembering being a toddler again.<br /><br />The texture is softer than peanut butter and softer than other jar almond butters that I have had before.  It is not unpleasant, just a bit of a surprise with the first squeeze of the packet.  I also ordered the HONEY ALMOND BUTTER variety, which I have not yet enjoyed, but am now looking forward to.<br /><br />These will be great to keep in a drawer at work or in the car, and will be an easy, quick addition to lunch boxes.  Each packet is 200 calories, so it is very satisfying. There is a high fat content, but good fats, so no worries there.<br /><br />RECOMMEND!!  Especially if you have dental work coming up.  ;-)

It's the only way I've been able to get nut butter past airport security - usually they confiscate if I take in a tupperware.<br />The con about this product is that a bunch of the nut butter never gets squeezed out so I have to slice them open and scrape out the good stuff.

review/summary: Tired of plain old cup of noodles?
review/text: I would have given this five out of five stars, it is just this soup (like ALL packaged soups) is a bit on the salty side. BUT, not as salty as an average cup of "cup of noodles."<br /><br />This soup has a much better flavor than instant soups, and, even though I'm not sure what miso is, I'm sure it is far healthier than the salted preservative loaded dehydrated chicken bits one finds in instant soups.<br /><br />I liked it so much, I've even given it in a care package to my sister in law who is in college. A great fast soup, and a healthier alternative to other instant soups.

review/summary: Works Absolutely Great, Until Your Cat Outsmarts You
review/text: I have two cats, one is mine and the other is my girlfriends. My cat, although he isn't thrilled with getting the occasional "tummy pill," does do pretty well with them and doesn't usually throw too bad of a fit. My girlfriend's cat on the other hand, is quite the opposite. That little bugger will throw one of the biggest fits you ever seen when you attempt to give him a pill. You would think that we are trying to give him a bath he throws such a fit, which is another story all together!<br /><br />Anyhow, we bought some of these "pill hiding treats" in an attempt to get him to take his medicine without the daily fight that is usually attached to the act of pill taking. The very first time we tried them we were both a bit apprehensive wondering if we had just wasted some money on treats instead of the normal band-aids which come in quite handy at pill time. Needless to say, these "pill pockets" worked!<br /><br />We were literally amazed the first time that we gave him one with a pill in it and he actually gulped it down without even tasting it. Oh, what joy swept through our household. Little did we know that it was only going to last about 2 weeks. Just enough time for use to become complacent as far as the daily pill act was concerned.<br /><br />Sure enough, we were once again outsmarted by the cat. Approximately two weeks into the "pill hiding treat" debacle, we started finding his pill on the floor but no sign of the pill pocket. We soon discovered that the little bugger was chewing the pill pocket off from around the pill and eating it without eating the pill.<br /><br />Now we give him several "pill hiding treats" throughout the day, and only one of them has the pill in it, but he never knows which one it is. Although we never put it in the very first one, or the very last one. This has been working now for about a month, but I figure were running out of time on this one and had better start thinking up a new plan of attack before we are once again outsmarted by the cat.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Cat Lover

review/summary: Belly Fat??
review/text: I have reordered this product before in 240 count. I was waiting for my appointment at Yale New Haven Hospital and viewing the hospital closed circuit TV which was explaining health tips. The topic changed to the benefits of green tea and it mentioned it's anti oxidant properties and the fact that it helps reduce belly fat!!. I do not have a real problem in this area as I am 5' 10 1/2" tall and weighed 209 lbs. After surgery I had to watch my diet and with the help of Stash Green Tea consumed cold from a 32 once thermos at least three times weekly I have lost 17 lbs and inches from my belly area. TIP; Cut the string and tab off four tea bags and place in a 32 oz. thermos, top off with filtered water. You can refill with water all day or add one or two additional tea bags while leaving the others in the thermos. Keep refrigerated if possible. Ice cubes will rupture the tea bags. Try this for three months for at least three days a week or more and see if the belly isn't flatter!!

review/text: I'm picky about my green teas. Sometimes they're too weak, sometimes it just doesn't smell/taste like green tea, or sometimes it's just horribly bitter/sour and unpalatable (think most grocery store teas).<br /><br />But Stash's green tea is TERRIFIC. There's a good element of leafyness (it IS green after all) without much bitter/sourness. I can usually pull at least 2 good cups of hot green tea from each tea bag.<br />I was actually previously disappointed by Yogi's Green tea (it's just purely green tea leaves, can't remember the exact name of it though) - when steeped in hot water it smelled like burnt tires, so I almost lost hope in American grocery store teas. I previously would only buy the Yamamotoyama green teas (slight roasted flavor) and Stash's green tea tastes remarkably similar, which makes me incredibly happy due to the Stash tea sales that have been going on at my local markets. WOO!!!

review/text: It should probably be called Lemongrass Mint to more accurately describe the taste.  It's especially good as ice tea, but drinking it hot is enjoyable too.  The mint taste is not as strong as the lemongrass.  I notice that some reviewers here say they barely taste the lemongrass, while others think it overwhelms the mint.  It's a good idea to buy a box of this tea to try it out before ordering 6 boxes.  I usually drink Bigelow Plantation Mint black tea, so I'm accustomed to a strong mint flavor.  Lucky for me that I like lemongrass too, so the balance of lemongrass and mint was not a problem for me.

review/text: I realize that taste in tea, and particularly green tea is a matter of personal preference. For me, I found this tea to be unpleasant. Opening the tea bag, I detected an aroma reminiscent of lawn clippings. As I drank the tea, I find the unpleasant aroma becomes an unpleasant taste. I am not sure how to describe it . . . perhaps wet lawn clippings or even a mossy taste. I do not get the sharp "bite" I normally expect from a good green tea.<br /><br />I will try this for a week, and see if I am missing something, but as for now, I can not recommend purchasing this tea.

review/text: I far prefer this brand of green tea over Lipton and some others I've found available at the grocery store. Good quality tea, good flavor. However, the price they are offering you to buy in bulk online is higher than buying 6 single boxes at the store. I've found this tea is always between $2 and $2.50 per box of 20. Multiply $2.50 by 6 and you get $15.00. They are asking $16.50 before shipping for the same amount. I think I'll keep buying it at the store.

That would be great, I'm sure- I just happen to like my tea hot.

The new Mojito mint by Stash is also great.  I don't like it quite as much as this one, but I drink a ton of tea, and have about 5 favorites- and this and the Mojito are definitely two of the 5 (I also love the Stash organic Chai)

review/text: So this is the first green tea ive bought and the second ive tasted. The first one i tasted was alittle better tasting. This stash green tea however does taste lets say, 'natural'. what i mean by that is it taste exactly like what it is, all natural dried herbs. It does look like leafs though not just crushed up almost powdery stuff like the other bag i drank. Im not quite sure what green tea is supposed to taste like but this one is NOT good but its NOT that bad either and its also NOT sweet at all. But hey i am drinking green tea for its health benefits not for its flavor. Overall though i DO recommend this green tea just like the name says it does appear to be premium green tea judging by how it looks and the 'natural' taste, so if your just after those health benefits you wont be disappointed if you want good taste this probably wont make you happy.

I drink this every single day at work, often using 4-5 packs a day. Fair warning: this 6-pack may not be that great of a deal, depending on where you live. I can get it at the supermarket for about $2.48 a box. To have this 6-pack work out to be a better bargain than buying local it would have to be 14 bucks per, or less. BUT, that has nothing to do with the quality of this product. The tea itself is great.

This has a smooth, refreshing taste that you can enjoy every day or when you are tired of tea with milk. I like this tea with one packet of stevia. It would also be great with honey. If you don't think this is strong enough use two tea bags like I do.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Pure and Not Bitter
review/text: Green tea can be very bitter especially if you brew it too long. This tea brews quickly and has a very pure taste and delicate aroma. I like drinking each cup with a packet of stevia. It seems to sweeten it just enough without masking the subtle silky flavors. This tea is made of rare white tea and green tea. White tea actually has more antioxidants than green tea and has less caffeine. So this particluar tea is very healthy. However you will probably drink it often because it tastes so good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: No Bitter Taste like Other Green Teas
review/text: My first impression of Stash's green chai tea is that it isn't bitter like other green teas. The spices are also mild. This tea contains green tea, cinnamon, ginger root, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil. I normally would not add milk to a green tea but adding two tablespoons of nonfat milk powder and a packet of stevia makes this tea perfectly soothing. If you don't like tea overly spicy this will appeal to you. I think it tastes better than a lot of chai teas made with black tea leaves.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: The Best of the Best!
review/text: I love Jasmine tea! More than anyone trust me. I got my first shipment of six boxes yesterday and have signed up for delivery every two months. The box it came in said "Stash" on the side. I'm assuming this tea came directly from the company. I should think it did by how cheap it is! At the grocery stores near me this tea is $3 a box on sell. This is a great deal!<br /><br />Stash is by far the best company for jasmine tea. I love this stuff! The only thing I would say to a new customer is don't reuse tea bags. Other than that, enjoy! It doesn't get better than this!

review/summary: Maybe I have a bad batch
review/text: I was a bit shocked to see all the high ratings on here, so maybe it's my box: perhaps it was mishandled. So far the two cups I've made taste like plastic and chemicals. I'll try brewing it loose leaf in case the taste is coming from the bags, but so far I found this tea disappointing.

review/summary: Mint?
review/text: This is the first STASH tea I will not purchase again. I won't be giving it away or toss it out to get rid of, but . .  where is the mint!?  Very, very mild mint flavor. With Moroccan Mint clearly plastered on the box, I really expected more flavor.
