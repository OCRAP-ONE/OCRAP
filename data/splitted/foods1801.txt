review/summary: very disappointed and way too much $ for what it is
review/text: Have numerous empty wrappers in my bag and candy is hard and does not seem fresh. Seems like way to much money for what I ended up with. I guess I should have checked our local stores first I could buy the same amount for less than half of the price I paid. Was gong to ship item back but the cheapest shipping to return it was over $8.00. Live and learn.

review/summary: Big Bag!
review/text: no problems with this purchase at all, its a very big bag of candy and none are stale like previous commenters had described. The only thing that i will add and i really think they should put this in their description is that it comes in an un-factory sealed bag, for me this was not a problem, but im sure that their are alot of people out their that feel differently. My reason for understanding is i can only find these candy's in bags mixed with all sorts of different candy's. assuming that this is the case, their is no such product available with just these little flavored tootsies factory sealed from the tootsie factory.

review/summary: A little less variety than hoped
review/text: I received all of the tootsie roll flavors, however I was looking for specifically the lime green one to use on a baking project. I was pretty disappointed that in an entire 3 pounds, I only received 3 green ones. The rest were not stale and had just the flavor I was looking for, just hoping for more an even assortment.

review/summary: stale candy
review/text: I contacted this company regarding a recent purchase because I was unsatisfied. I ordered some flavored tootsie rolls - although I was happy with the shipping the quality was lacking. It was a 3 lb. bag and all of the candy was hard/stale. I emailed the company directly and was granted no response. I would not recommend this company.

review/summary: Tootsie rolls area  classic
review/text: I love candy and flavored Tootsie rolls are some of my favorite.  If you like candy I don't really see how you can not like these.  But in the end candy likes are just a personal preference.  I prefer Tootsie rolls and candies like that so I'm good with it.  And price wise compared to in stores, you can't beat the prices on Amazon.  Shipping is the only thing that you have to look out for or otherwise you will loose whatever saving you get.

review/summary: What dog can eat these?
review/text: Not really sure if I got a bad batch of them, or what? They don't expire for a year, but they were so hard, that I had to use a knife and 20 plus pounds of pressure to break in half. After breaking it in half, I gave my Jack Russell/ Chihuahua half of it, 20 minutes later, she is still tossing it around my living room, chasing it, and running from it. I think that she thinks it is a toy, because she cannot chew it. So unless your dog has shark teeth, I am not sure he or she would be able to eat these. Only 3 dollars, but I learned my lesson with these. We have used many other treats with her, and she has never had a problem before, impossible to train your dog with these, because they cannot chew them.

review/summary: Non-Chewy bites
review/text: As raven wrote, these bites are not chewy nor are they extra chewy as the package states.  In fact, these bites are just a tad softer than some rocks.  They are approximately an inch long and shaped like a bone with a pink filling (I bought the bacon-flavored version).  I cut them - a feat in itself - into 6 pieces to use as training treats.  My puppy does like them, but she is in the middle of losing her baby teeth and she can't chew them that well.  She takes awhile eating 1/6th of a bite.<br /><br />I am soaking a couple of bites in water to see if they will soften up so my puppy doesn't have to gum the pieces for 5min.

review/summary: The one and only Maggi WUERZE
review/text: This is the "real" stuff. Unlike the Maggi sold with the English label "Maggi SEASONING", the "Maggi WUERZE" tastes like the original stuff, is much stronger and therefore requires much less. It is also, unfortunately, more than twice as expensive and very had to find, unless especially ordered by the store. A few drops to a bowl of rice or on vegetables lend a unique flavor to them as only Maggi can. I can strongly recommend THIS Maggi to all, especially those who are looking for the inimitable European taste of Maggi. It can be purchased in several sizes on-line thru Amazon.

review/summary: Maggi-W&uuml;rze The best salad dressing ingredient!
review/text: Yes! After long exhaustive search online or for a store in Columbia, SC; Amazon.com offers the only option. Like the gentleman from McCormick, SC I also agree a little goes a very long way. Maggi-W&uuml;rze added to some oil, water, red-wine vinegar, & my Oma's secret ingredient (may she rest in peace) makes a GREAT Salad Dressing! As long as Amazon keeps having sellers for this all will be well in my kitchen & with my appetite as all other salad dressings are just not the same as something you make yourself.

review/summary: The cats love them, so that's a plus
review/text: We've really cut back on the treats that we'll give our cats.<br />The more we read labels, the less packaged foods we buy for us, and the choosier we get even for our pets.<br />There's just too much junk in them all!<br /><br />Now, Friskies often uses a lot of fillers, but cats love the taste. I think they have figured out the<br />equivalent of kitty-MSG! However, these are one of the less junky treats for your cats.<br /><br />We've had them 2 or 3 times now, and they are always eaten. Believe me, we have several opened bags<br />of uneaten treats in the drawer that our cats have refused to eat, so always glad to see them like something.<br /><br />The cheese flavor is their favorite Crispie, but one of our cats likes the salmon one too.<br />We still don't buy them very often, because for some reason, Friskies can't seem to sever their love<br />affair with corn products in their cat food and cat treats. Cats don't need or want corn, so it has to be a cheap<br />filler for the manufacturer.<br /><br />The ingredients are as follows:<br />Brewers rice, chicken meal, corn gluten meal, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), animal liver flavor, malt extract, natural and artificial flavors, phosphoric acid, brewers dried yeast, dried cheese powder, added color (Yellow 6, Yellow 5 and other color), salt, L-ascorbyl-2-polyphosphate (source of Vitamin C), citric acid, BHA (a preservative), BHT (a preservative), calcium carbonate. A-6215.<br /><br />So, are they perfect?  No, but they are crunchy, taste cheesy, and the cats do like them.<br />One note - brewers yeast is NOT the same yeast you make bread with, so don't worry about that.

They *might* appeal to boys in the tub, but I use the brown to enhance the appeal of chocolate milk (I can get away with less syrup!). Black can be used to write on cakes.

review/summary: Works well converting regular recipes to GF recipes
review/text: Learning to cook GF has been a big adjustment.  It takes time and patience to find solutions that work.  With my wife as a Celiac it has required diligent searching for good options.  On a recent trip to Utah we picked up several New Grains GF breads and found them the best GF breads we have ever had.  I decided to pick up some of this flour and use it to see how baking some of our favorite recipes would turn out.<br /><br />The flour works well as a GF substitute for regular baking flour.  I've used it in many recipes and have been happy with the results.  As is typical for GF cooking, there's a little less of a rise in the cooking process.  I'll upload a picture from a recent Pineapple Upside down cake we cooked in a 12" Dutch oven that turned out really great as a GF desert.<br /><br />5 stars, we love having a GF flour to cook and bake with.

review/text: This Tandoori BBQ Chicken mix is very good.<br />We received a lot of compliments on this recipe when we grilled it last summer and our guests went out of their way to say "wow", that's good... what recipe is that?  It's very flavorful and a little spicy but not hot or anything.<br /><br />We originally found Shan Tandoori spice mix at a tiny 4 table restaurant/grocery store for $1.99 when the owner happened to stock it for a while.  I went back to get more but they quickly ran out so I'm glad to find it here also.  There are literally several hundred other interesting spice mixes like this from overseas once you know where to look.<br /><br />Maybe Amazon can work with more vendors on this type of product since Shan Tandoori mix sells online for $1.25 at 'America's largest online India Grocer'.  Amazon has them as a partner already so I figured it's ok to mention there's hundreds of other recipes to try that aren't listed here yet.<br /><br />Most of these recipes call for lots of fresh vegetables such as garlic, tomatoes, cilantro, fresh ginger, etc.  Over the next few weeks we'll try some of the other variations....<br /><br />Aaloo Bhaji Curry Mix<br />Chappli Kabab Masala<br />Tandoori Chicken BBQ<br />Bombay Biryani Masala<br />Dopiaza / Stew Curry<br />Maesri Masaman Curry<br />Tikka Seekh Kabab BBQ<br />Parampara Prawn Masala

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: Well I must say that I was surprised to find both the pecan and cashew honey nut butter. Delivery time was very prompt. Afraid that is the only good thing I have to say about these two products, both from Superior Nut Company. Upon arrival I was eager to taste them, so opened the Pecan up and found it to be like soup. After mixing it for 15 min. it still remained soup. So I decided to open the cashew up and have some of it. Well the cashew one was so dry and thick that you couldn't spread it on anything without destroying it. Only thing I have to say is "buyer beware"!!!!!!!

review/text: This company is fantastic! I bought these sausages as a Christmas gift for a family member. The shipping company damaged my order in transit, and Burgers' Smokehouse had a replacement package to me before the end of my delivery date estimate. My family member loved these, they like to hunt and try different meats/foods.  This made the extra wait for them worth it in my eyes, especially since Burgers' Smokehouse was so helpful in the replacement process.  I definitely recommend this sampler to anyone interested in some exotic sausages!

review/summary: My favorite flavor
review/text: When you were a kid, did you ever pick a grape fresh off the vine and squeeze the insides of it into your mouth?  If you did and you loved grapes as much as I did, that is exactly what the White Grape flavor tastes like.<br /><br />The Diet Rite products are sweetened with Splenda, and what's more important to me, they have no sodium at all (besides no calories, carbs or caffeine).<br /><br />This flavor tastes nothing like what you'd expect - so if you are expecting what purple grape usually tastes like, this will be a disappointment.  I hate purple grape flavor, this is completely different and tastes great.

review/text: This honey is not buttery, it's just weird.  It tastes like burnt molasses, and I like molasses, but not when it's scorched.  If your looking for a good honey the Airborne Tawari Honey is excellent.  It has a much bolder taste than traditional clover honeys, but without a the peculiar smell and aftertaste of the Tropic Bee honey. Also note, this item is NON-RETURNABLE. That would be fine if I was only stuck with one bottle, but now I'm stuck with four bottles of honey I can't stand the taste of and would be to embarrassed to even gift to someone I didn't like.  Stay clear of this foul smelling, scorched tasting honey.

review/summary: Consul Snails have rough ride or are seconds?
review/text: Im writing only to voice that, like another reviewer, oddly also in Colorado, mine arrived rather bashed up-enough so that I will discard the cans.  Purhcased directly from Amazon-they were in a plastic bag in a larger box, along with another item-I cannot absolutley determine if they are sold dented or were damaged in transit-<br /><br />However, if i had to guess based on the packing and how they fit and the position of the dents versus other stuff in the box-which could only have touched the can tops-these are sent with dents<br /><br />Amazon was great about a credit when i reported the damaged item.  Was looking forward to trying these after the great reviews.<br /><br />I might add too, this is a product of Indonesia -so these are what i believe are aschatane-ie Asian snails-an equally nice snail -but not the same as French Helix snails most often found in restaurants<br /><br />update: got some more of these, undented this time-excellent product and if you love snails, a great way to serve five friends a DOZEN at a time.  Nice size, texture and flavor.  A very good product and an excellent value.

I recommend cutting puff pastry circles slightly larger than each individual "cup" in the baking bowl. Unbelievable consistency and flavor. The "cover" seals in the moisture and flavor and you get just the right ratio of escargot:pastry. Enjoy.

review/text: This apple cider mulling spice blend is perfect. It can be used with an entire gallon of cider or in a single cup. Most of the other cider mulling herbs have to be used all at once, but since I like to drink cider the way I would have a cup of tea, this is the perfect ingredient to make each cup special. You just put in a teaspoon or two and you have the perfect hot cider. I had found another product like this one several years ago but it is no longer made and I was ecstatic to find the Aspen mulling spice blend. Of course you can use it with other type of drinks, but for me, it makes the perfect autumn hot apple cider drink. Although it has to be purchased as a pack of 9, the extra ones make wonderful gifts for special people.

Flavor is really nice and works well with wine also.

The smell of apple cider and mulling spices warming on the stove always transports me back to my parents house when my mother would make the cider. I completely recommend it.<br /><br />FYI, for those noticing that what they ordered is not what is shown in the picture, Aspen rebranded 1.5 years ago. This means they changed their packaging and logo. The picture shown with the black/beige carton and red cup is old. The new is red and beige with cinnamon sticks on the front.

review/text: I ordered the Mulling spices as pictured.  What I received was the Spiced Cider mix as described.  I paid extra to have a case of it sent overnight mail.  I am very disappointed.  Apparently the ad department got the wrong ad with the picture and what I saw was not what I got.  I'm sending it back but who knows if I will get a refund and I'm probably definitely out the $22 overnight fee which seems wrong since it's their fault. BE AWARE!

review/text: I don't usually like to share when things are amazing - I like to keep it to myself, but this is the best tasting spice ever. Mix it with apple cider and the aroma is intoxicating. For Christmas, we like this drink hot, and we add a little bit of whipped cream on top, and drizzle a little bit of caramel on top. It's so delicious! My parents have requested it as part of the Christmas tradition.

If you're used to a higher quality like DoMatcha, you will be really disappointed in this. It is quite sour and briny compared.

review/summary: convenient single servings
review/text: I never understood using these until I was in a location where I was the only coffee drinker in an office / work-center and the water fountain was a long way away. One touch for one cup of coffee makes a lot of sense in that scenario, you also don't end up burning a pot that has been reheated throughout the day. These have a 4.3 star of 5 review strength on other websites and I'm inclined to agree. So the per serving cost is up over a whole pot, but then if you pick the same gourmet level coffee roasts, then its not that much difference, and you even save if you consider how often you might need to dump a pot. The same argument could be used for any pre-packaged or single serving product, making your own is often cheaper and you can get ingredients in bulk, but if you're only making for one or it is a longer process... convenience wins out every time.

review/summary: Be creative!  This is just the beginning!
review/text: I ordered this because so many of the dip mixes I've used have been full of MSG or partially hydrogenated stuff, artifical colors and flavoring etc., and MSG gives me migraines.  This one does not.  If there is MSG in it, then there is so little that it doesn't effect me.<br /><br />The strongest flavor is green onion -- and it's very good -- followed by minced regular dehydrated onions.  It is a little salty, but if you add an additional 1/2c sour cream (or plain yogurt) it's perfect.  Or, if you're using it to dip raw veggies rather than heavily salted chips, it's not so salty.<br /><br />But that's just the beginning. Add 1/3 c of minced sundried tomatoes!  Or, 1/2 c of crisp bacon crumbles!  Or, go all out and makes a sour cream topping for baked potatoes with bacon, fresh ground black pepper, and some shredded sharp cheddar added.  Or, add 1t of Tabasco for a spicy onion dip!  Or, grill up some fresh onions and mince them into the dip.  Or, saute a handful of mushrooms!<br /><br />Not all this company's dips are as carefully pruned-down with the bad ingredients -- but this one works.

review/summary: oils better than extracts for making pizzelles
review/text: Pizzelles are our favorite family cookie....all my kids now make them too.  Flavor in pizzelles (we make them in many flavors) is subtle so creating a lasting flavor is almost impossible with extracts, but the flavoring oils do the job.  Some of my friends freeze these cookies and some keep them in airtight tins and they can be pulling them out 6 months to a year later and if I flavored them with oils instead of extracts the flavors are still wonderful.

review/text: I received a sample package of Wheaties Fuel Cereal with my local Sunday newspaper last week.  It tasted VERY good -- so good, in fact, that it has become my new favourite cereal!  It must be a combination of the<br />sugar, honey, brown sugar syrup, and cinnamon that gives it a totally unique, totally delicious sweetness.<br /><br />This cereal is a "multi-type" cereal, in that not all parts of it look the same.  Darker flakes mix with lighter, rice-crispies-like nuggets, and with small clusters seemingly made from the flakes, to create a visually-different cereal that is almost as exciting to see as it is to eat!<br /><br />It also has an "OU-Dairy" seal, from the Jewish Orthodox Union, for those to whom things being kosher is important.<br /><br />On the nutritional good side, this cereal boasts 5 grams of fiber, in every 210 caloorie, 3/4 cup serving. It also has more of a percentage of vitamins and minerals, (ranging from 4% to 110%), of any cereal I have ever seen.  On the bad side, it has 14 grams of sugar per seving.  (Don't eat too much of this cereal at once....or your heart will start racing!)<br /><br />Also to be noted, is that wheat products of ANY kind, and ANY variety of rice, corn, and oil, (with which this particular cereal is LOADED), are said to be bad for the eyes.  So -- balance eating this cereal with eating eggs and drinking tea -- both of which are said to be good for your eyes.<br /><br />This cereal is now the "official" cereal of The Ironman Triathalon -- so you know it's got to have SOME sort of superiour nutrition.  On the back of the package are portraits of five male sports stars: Hunter Kemper - Triathalon Champion, Kevin Garnett - Basketball Champion, Peyton Manning - Football Champion, Albert Pujols, and Bryon Clay -- Decathalon Champion,  They all look very strong and very sure of themselves -- AND as if they are challenging the viewer to join them......<br /><br />I wondered why there were no other boxes of Wheaties' Fuel Cereal with WOMEN athletes on them, and called up the General Mills phone number on the box to ask.  I mentioned too, that years ago there had been a commercial which had the jingle: "He's ready for Wheaties / He knows he's a man!" -- and that because of this jingle, I, a woman, had been afraid to even try Wheaties!  She assured me that she would pass my suggestion -- that there be another box, with women basketball players, ski champions, ballet dancers, ice skaters, and the like, on it -- on to her supervisors.<br /><br />In the meantime, I'm glad I got this particular 14-box collection.  It drives down the cost of each box.  I also intend to put some of this cereal into my blender, turn it into crumbs, and use it instead of breadcrumbs in a number of dishes.<br /><br />When eaten in reasonable amounts, this sugary-cereal- with-lots-fiber can, I think, be very good for one.<br />Only -- don't overdo eating it, even though it is quite sweet, and quite delicious!

review/summary: Movie Theatre size, good value!
review/text: I was very pleased with the size of the boxes, they are movie-theater size. Also, the expiration date on the box they came in says they expire in 2013, so I guess they aren't supposed to go stale anytime soon. I doubt I'll have them that long though! Still it's nice to know that I'm getting a fresh product that won't get old before I have a chance to use it. I'd rather have some candy squirreled away for those sugar cravings then waste it on spontaneous purchases at the gas station where the candy is over-priced. The first time I bought a case of candy from Amazon I felt a bit ridiculous, but the expiration date is always at least 6 months out. Sometimes it's nice to have the extra candy around for the holidays too, to throw in a stocking, or Easter basket. I like that there is a variety of flavors, because one flavor could get boring for an entire case.

review/summary: A Box of Memories
review/text: When I was around 8 years old my family took me and my younger brother on our first trip to Cape Cod Massachusetts, since then we went up once every summer for a week or so, those first few years we would take a pop up camper to a camp site by the beach. The campsite itself had two memorable things, the first was a play ground my brother and I would spend time at, and the second was a small candy shop down by the end of the road leading up to the camp site, it was in this candy store that I had my first box of Nerds.<br /><br />My brother and I looked all over the candy store with the wide eyed wonder of the literal kid in a candy shop. The one thing that caught my eye was the small pink and purple box of candy up by the register. Since our mother only let us buy one thing each this is what I chose, and my brother (always copying me) chose the same, which we enjoyed on our way back to the camper. Of all the tastes on that trip, the marshmellows we toasted over the campfire, the seafood we had in the local resturants, my first bite of buttered lobster, the wind and saltwater on the beach, it was that little box of candy that my brother and I shared on the way back to the camper that stands out to me the most.<br /><br />Many years later in high school I met one of my best friends working at thelocal FYE, his name was Andrew and we first started talking over one of the jumbo boxes of Nerds, striking up a conversation about how you got almost a pound of candy with the box of Nerds, and how other candy boxes skimped out and filled it with mostly empty space. For most of my high school years he and I would hang out at the store, exchange stories, shoot the breeze, ect, usualy over a box of Nerds.<br /><br />Ive now been out of high school for almost four years, Andrew and I have lost touch over the past few years, and my brother died almost 7 years ago. After all this time these tint little candies still bring back all th happy memories from my childhood and teen years. Bravo Wonka on this exellent product.

He smiled, gave me a thumbs up, and has loved Bumble Bars ever since.<br /><br />Not only are Bumble Bars good for you, they're great for school snacks, the chocolate flavor is appealing to kids, and they're portable.<br /><br />I do think they have a bit of an odd after taste and my son's friends have said that the first bite is good, but after that it tastes funny. To each his own. They're gluten free and that's what matters most to our family.
