review/summary: for my hcg diet
review/text: I bought these for my HCG diet, along with melba rounds. I must say, they are not only completely broken into bits, but also not the greatest tasting.  In fact, very little taste at all...and VERY dry and hard to swallow without a big glass of water.

review/summary: Caused head tremors in my Boxer.
review/text: I do not recommend this food for your pet. I ordered this as a replacement food for my two adult boxers. About a week after transitioning to this food my two year old female started having head tremors. I did some research and found that this is benign and can happen with foods with certain ingredients. I changed the food and the head tremors stopped. I now feed my dogs Taste of the Wild and love it.

review/summary: Perfect Tins for the Potter Fan
review/text: The tins are exactly as described and well worth the price.  The rectangular tins have hinges so that you don't lose the lids.  The colors are bright, and the design are very Harry Potter.<br /><br />I would highly recommend these tins to any Harry Potter fan.  I can't wait to put my baked goods in these for parties!

review/summary: Not worth the money
review/text: I purchased this thinking the tins would be filled with Harry Potter treats! Looking back, I see there was no mention of the food/candy in the item description so that was my fault, but I think these are way overpriced. Thankfully for me they only sent one tin instead of six, so I sent it back for a full refund. Without the actual treats to put in the tins I don't really see the point of this set.

review/summary: Bad taste and consistancy
review/text: I am a big fan of Summer Susages and this has to be the worst one I have ever had.  The consistanty is that of a paste that has been form pressed into the shape of a susage.  I had to put it in the freezer to give it any firmness at all.  That alone makes it entirly unappealing as I feel like I am squishing a pureed form of fat in my mouth.  The flavor is not too bad, but it is pretty clearly all artificial.  I would highly recomend avoiding this product and go with another brand.  I would rate this zero stars if I could but 1 star was as low as it would go.

review/summary: Stevia Extract
review/text: I use stevia extract every day instead of sugar. This product is dependable. By the pound, it is far cheaper than the 1 ounce bottles sold in stores. I cook for diabetic people and this eliminates the sugar problem. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I will buy again.<br />For those unfamiliar with the amount to use - use 1/2 teaspoon of extract instead of 1 cup of granulated sugar.

review/summary: Excellant product - good price
review/text: Now makes an excellant product and amazon provides it at a very good price with prompt delivery.  The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.  1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste.  Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.<br /><br />I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation.

review/summary: Bad batch of Stevia
review/text: Stevia is kind of funny. Brands and batches vary. Sometimes you get a batch that isn't very sweet or has more of an aftertaste (bitterness). Usually, I only have to use 1/16 of a tsp of NOW Stevia to sweeten my morning coffee. The batch I received this time is weak, so I have to use twice as much. (Thank goodness it isn't bitter though.) So it goes with using a natural sweetener. The leaves from which this batch of stevia was extracted must not have had a very high concentration of rebaudiana. I strongly believe that the manufacturer should test out each batch made for quality before packaging it so customers aren't disappointed. Oh, well, better luck next time. I'll still use stevia as a sweetener (I use it in everything I need sweetened). I'm just going to wait a while before buying more NOW stevia until I'm fairly certain all of this batch has been sold.

review/text: I have been using Now's Stevia Extract for a year now and am totally satisfied.  I like sugar, but not the fat.  Nutra-Sweet and Equal have negative health issues and are expensive.  I use Stevia in my iced tea, on my cerial, and I bake pies with it.  Other than slightly clouding my tea, it tasts wonderfully sweet with no calories.  I like buying it by the pound, and Amazon has the best price.

review/summary: SUPER NATURAL SUGER SUBSTITUTE + TERRIFIC BRAND
review/text: EXCELLENT SUGAR SUBSTITUTE HAS HEALTH BENEFITS + NO WARNINGS,<br /><br />This "NOW Stevia powder" is good stuff and this among the most economical and user-friendly ways to buy Stevia.<br /><br />WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT:<br /><br />Sweeter than sugar, that's what Stevia is, but that's not all.<br /><br />Stevia has been shown to lower blood sugar levels in research involving healthy adults by increasing the secretion of insulin making Stevia useful for diabetics.<br /><br />It also improves digestion and gastrointestinal function, and is useful for upset stomachs and to reduce gas and stomach acidity. Several recent studies have shown that it may improve the heart's muscle tone and promote the body's water loss. These properties are thought to contribute to lower blood pressure.<br /><br />Stevia also has antiviral, antimicrobial and antibacterial characteristics. It's used for relieving bleeding gums, sore throats and cold sores in South America and Japan. Stevia has been shown to inhibit plaque formation and bacterial growth causing gum disease and tooth decay, and will not cause cavities. It may even reduce cravings for sweets which coupled with its lack of calories may be helpful in weight loss.<br /><br />ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS EVEN MORE:<br /><br />There is anecdotal evidence that Stevia is good for skin problems like acne, cold sores, dermatitis and eczema, and may speed up the healing of cuts and scratches. There have even been reports that Stevia may be useful as a contraceptive, but that has not yet been substantiated by research.<br /><br />FDA APPROVAL TO BE SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT -- NOT A SWEETENER<br /><br />Most of all, Stevia, unlike the artificial sweeteners we put in everything from soda to psyllium does not come with any health warnings from the FDA, and it will probably do you no harm. However, Stevia has not been approved to be sold as a sweetener even though it is a NATURAL SWEETENER LIKE SUGAR. Nevertheless, Stevia has been approved [since 1994] to be sold as a dietary supplement in the United States.<br /><br />AFTER ALL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED THIS IS FOOD - USE IT BY EATING IT!<br /><br />Stevia can be substituted for sugar. It is a bit different tasting if one is use to sugar. I use it on many things where I can eliminate large amounts of honey and/or sugar such as;<br /><br />1]- Herbal Tea, instead of sugar or honey.<br /><br />2]- In multi-grain hot cereal, when you need to sweeten it, Stevia saves me a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of sugar per large bowl. In this case I just add about a teaspoon of honey and 1/8 teaspoon of stevia for the same effect. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar so use about 1/10th as much in place of sugar.<br /><br />3]- Iced Tea.<br /><br />4]- Pancakes, waffles and French Toast as a replacement for some maple syrup.<br /><br />MEDICINALLY SPEAKING:<br /><br />A standardized extract of 57 mg. containing 85% "steviocides" in a beverage, is what Doctor James A. Duke, suggests in his famous, "The Green Pharmacy Herbal Handbook".<br /><br />ABOUT FORMS AND BRANDS:<br /><br />I prefer Stevia in powder over the packets, as I can better measure, and use what I need for each individual use. Purchase Stevia in whatever form you are most comfortable using.<br /><br />This "NOW" brand Stevia powder is an excellent product and a terrific value. "Planetary Formulas Stevia Powder 3.5 oz." is also excellent and it comes in a liquid as well. "Swanson" and "Nature's Way" are both excellent too, and have Stevia in powder, liquid and packets for convenient use. Any of the above choices are excellent, and I have used them all at one time or another, over the past 3-4 years on a daily basis.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

review/summary: my preferred sweetener
review/text: I have been a diabetic for almost forty years.  I have tried many sweeteners over the years, some of which caused me some severe reactions.  Years ago, I decided I preferred stevia.  Lately I did another comparison between the different stevia brands.  Better Stevia Organic in the packets is the one I decided to go with.  I do not bake with sweeteners and eat very little baked goods since I am selective on how I expend my carb allowance.  Mostly I just use the stevia in beverages. The organic stevia packets are lined with an inner seal, I suppose to keep it fresh and to keep it from getting hard. However when you hold the packet over a cup of hot beverage the stevia draws moisture and clings to the liner making it difficult to pour out. I simply add the stevia to my cup before I pour in the liquid.  It also does not dissolve quickly in iced beverages.  It takes a minute or two for it to completely dissolve. I like this Stevia Organic enough to deal with these issues.  It does not have additional ingredients.  It is just organic stevia and I like it that way.

review/text: I love NOW's stevia extract, I put it in everything - tea, cereal, curries, stir fries, baking.  There are no sugar carbs at all and it is 200 time sweeter than sugar so 1 lb goes a long way.  The savings with a pound it amazing (compared to $10 for a very small container) and it seems to stay good for a long time, it takes me sometimes a year to finish it.  Some people find that stevia leaves an aftertaste that do not care for so you may want to try a smaller bottle first if you have never tried it.  Every brand supposedly is a little different so if you don't have good luck with one try another.

BEWARE IF YOU HAVE DIABETES and think this is a safe sugar substitute.  It's NOT!  Below is a quote from a website (the link follows)...and there are plenty of others with warnings for maltodextrin for those who are looking for an safe sugar substitute.<br /><br />PLUS... I don't care what anyone says.  If you think this is the best stevia product ever (and many actually do!) then you haven't tried the right stevia manufacturer.  NOW isn't one of them.<br />I ordered this shoe in the correct size but they were huge.  i am returning them & hoping that the smaller size will work.  they match the dress perfect & are adorable.<br />..."It's the combination that may cause spikes in insulin because maltodextrin is a carbohydrate with a high glycemic index, similar to table sugar and should be used in moderation if you have diabetes or hypoglycemia.

review/summary: Do Not Like the Taste Compared to Truvia
review/text: I tried this product and I have to say that I just cannot tolerate the taste.  At least for me, it tastes awful. I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I have been using Truvia and Truvia tastes much more like sugar than this product.  I don't know what this tastes like.  It is unlike anything I've ever tasted - and it sure doesn't taste like sugar to me. I had to pour out a fresh pitcher of green tea because it tasted so bad.  I made another pitcher of tea with Truvia and it was much better tasting. I usually mix some real sugar with Stevia.  But this last pitcher of tea was sweetened only by Truvia (Stevia) and it was pretty good tasting. It certainly isn't an identical taste to sugar, but close enough after you adjust to the taste.  When I use Truvia with coffee and cream, I can't tell the difference with real sugar.  And that is probably because the French Vanilla cream overwhelms the overall taste.<br /><br />I know my review is counter to the other reviews, but it is just my experience and opinion.  Everybody has a different sense of taste. All food has a rather intense taste to me. About 25% of the population is a super taster. We have many more taste buds on our tongue. That describes me. So you may have a different experience than I did.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I've used stevia powder for years. NOW is an excellent source at a great price. If you are baking, stevia is not very good for that as it will not give the same texture as white sugar. However, it is outstanding for sweetening tea, coffee and smoothies.<br /><br />Many have claimed that stevia is 200 times as sweet as white sugar. I don't agree. To my taste it is no more than 16 times as sweet.<br /><br />Be careful about using too much because it slips from sweet to bitter to the taste when that happens.

review/summary: Amazing price as opposed to buying retail...
review/text: I've been on the Atkins/Low-Carb diet for several years so I avoid sugar like the plague. Also to be avoided are carbonated diet-drinks. Which leaves me little choice other than water. So, I make a half-gallon of Kool-Aid with a teaspoon of Stevia EXTRACT and a teaspoon of liquid saccharin. Some complain this is too sweet for their tastes. But, do the math, a pound of sugar is LOT more expensive and takes at least a full cup per half gallon.<br /><br />In the past, I've had to purchase Stevia at the health food stores for $12-$15 an OUNCE. Here I bought a POUND (16 ounces) for less that the cost of four ounces from the health food stores. Fantastic price!<br /><br />Be careful what you wish for, a POUND of Stevia is a LOT of Stevia (At least a year's worth...;-}  )<br /><br />In a year, I'll buy another jug of it.

I have been using it for over a yr, and even substitute it in my cooking, where it calls for 1/4, 1/2 or cup of splenda I use this instead BUT not equal portions I use the mini scoop, 1,2,3 scoopfuls is all thats needed.

review/text: Excellent product and received in record time...thanks and good job!  Taste is perfect and consistency the same.  The only thing I question is so much plastic is wasted because the container is less than half full each time I've ever received this product.  A container half the size or a slightly larger should be considered, to stop the waste of excess plastic that may end up in landfills if not recycled.  I wrote to the company three years ago and asked if they would consider package modification, but never was acknowledged.

review/summary: Teeny tiny spoon!
review/text: I've been trying a number of different kinds of stevia, both liquid and powder. This one is my favorite. It has a very neutral taste and one tiny spoon of it is perfect in a big glass of oolong hibiscus iced tea. A heaping tiny spoon of it is perfect in a chocolate/banana/soy milk smoothie. I originally got it to put in something called "mega muffins" but managed to use up an entire 1 oz container of it without even making the muffins and have had to order more. I really like that it's organic. I've been trying different sweeteners in my hibiscus oolong iced tea, and this is not only better than any other stevia product I've found, but works better than any other sweetener as well. Even regular granulated sugar. It dissolves pretty much instantly. I'm thinking about ordering the 1 lb size (although that would probably last me about two years) I just wonder if that size comes with the teeny tiny spoon!

review/text: As a healthier alternative to other sweeteners I have tried, stevia extract fulfilled the billing it had received.  I had been led to this brand (NOW) because it reportedly had less bitter aftertaste than other brands and I found that to be true although there is still a slight undesirable aftertaste.  Stevia provides sweetness but a different tasting sweetness that takes some time to get used to.

After searching, this is the only stevia we will buy. We recommend it to our family and anyone who wants to stay away from sugar.  Other products are full of chemicals that are worse than the sugar.  Now Foods Stevia extract powder is natural.  We only use about 1/8 of a teaspoon for a full 8oz cup of coffee. Even that may be too much. We buy it by the pound and it lasts a long time.  How can anyone not use this product to substitute sugar?! It is an excellent product.

review/summary: Better Than Sugar!
review/text: I have used Stevia for several years, but often have had trouble finding it. It was a real pleasure to find it on Amazon! Stevia is a natural sweetener made from the Stevia rebaundiana leaf. It is not an artificial sweetner made with chemicals. It has no unpleasant taste, though people who use artificial sweeteners may take a few days to get used to the lack of "chemical" sweeteners. Most people who use Stevia find that they can use less of it than other sweeteners as it's sweetness level is higher per packet. I recommend Stevia to anyone who wishes not to use sugar for any reason, but still likes things a bit sweet. By the way, Stevia has no calories.

Eventually filling my little bottles will get hard unless I transfer the bulk into a smaller container.<br /><br />The taste is fine to me, better than Trader Joe's.  I've never had Kal's to know what I am missing.  I mainly use the stevia in tea and Kool Aid lemonade.  DH even liked my tea w/ stevia and he is a big sweet tea drinker.  I have started baking banana bread w/ stevia and have been very pleased.  I've never minded what little aftertaste of Stevia since my mom used Sweet N Low when I was growing up.<br /><br />FYI-The 1 pound package didn't come w/ the tiny single scoop, unless buried at bottom.

review/summary: Very rich, smooth custardy pudding
review/text: This is a very rich version of British "custard" (not set, more like our vanilla pudding). It is usually served hot. I prefer Bird's Custard, which is a powdered mix that you add to milk and then sweeten to taste. I can make it with skim milk and halve the sugar and it makes a great creamy sauce to pour over a fruit crisp. This stuff is good, too, but it's a bit thick and sweet for my personal taste. Still, sometimes I find I crave it (and their rice pudding as well). It reminds me of the custard in many creme brulees, so if you enjoy that level of richness, you should give this a try.

review/summary: This Stuff Is Good!
review/text: I do a lot of grocery shopping at a nearby Fresh and Easy Market. They're a British company and sell a lot of items imported  from England. It's fun to try out new things. One of the new items is a 15-ounce can of Ambrosia Devon Custard.<br /><br />This is good! The label suggest that it's good hot, but I like it chilled from the fridge. The texture is smooth and creamy. The taste is excellent. The calories and fat content are modest with cholesterol being very low. The sodium content is tiny. This stuff could easily be used as a topping for something. Use your imagination. Personally, I just enjoy eating a small bowl of it. Really delicious!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Deceptive Description: Artificially flavored.
review/text: Item uses artificial flavor. Description was misleading in that it strongly implies that the product is natural by using phrases such as "without artificial colours or preservatives" while neglecting to mention other artificial ingredients (namely flavoring). I never use products that contain artificial ingredients; I want my recipes prepared by cooks, not by chemists. If that's not important to you then you may like this product.

review/text: My husband is English and of course misses a lot of grocery items from home.  It's been great lately that Amazon has started to offer so many of these beloved foods. Bought both the Ambrosia Custard and their Rice Pudding. The Custard is the original Ambrosia custard from the UK and very tasty.  If you aren't familiar with it, you may not like it as it has a slightly artificial taste, but if you are English or from the Commonwealth and know the product, I can assure you it's the original.

review/text: It's addictive!! Actually I am fond of Jane Austen movies. I've seen Sony Classic Pictures Persuasion many, many times. I noticed, in a luncheon scene after Anne's family moves to Bath, that the family was eating custard and it looked so yummy. So, I looked up English Custard and voila! Devon custard is the greatest in a parfait glass with whipped cream on top. Mmmmm. There's nothing like it!

review/text: WOW - this stuff rocks! I was so excited to try a sweet hot sauce, my hubby and I are obsessed with buying new hot sauces, its actually the first thing we look to purchase when we are traveling. I have never seen a pinapple based hotsauce and I couldnt wait to break into this bottle & it did NOT disappoint. Its not only sweet & hot there is ZERO vinegar taste...YAHOO! This little bottle has a lot of bite & we have tried it on everything & can't get enough! We only wish it came in a bigger bottle because by the last drops we are fighting over it like kids at a party grabbing at prizes from a Pinata! It's a household favorite now & I also got a bottle for my dad who is super picky when it comes to hot sauce as well & he LOVED it too.

review/summary: Stands out from the crowd
review/text: There's a lot of sauces out there in this here world and the field narrows when you get to fruit-based, but not enough.  Too many are overwhelmingly biting and acidic.<br />Not Pinata.<br />Pineapple based, not too thick and not too sweet, it is wonderful on almost anything you place on the table.<br />Eggs, beans, even salads shine with this lil bottle.<br /><br />Of course those multi-lingual amongst you will get the play on the Spanish word for pineapple but did you know that pineapple aids in digestion?<br />If you are one who stays away from hot sauce b/c of tummy troubles you may be pleasantly surprised with the after-effects.  Now this does not mean there is no heat to this sauce; mind you, there is enough to tingle your tongue.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Great tasting tea blend
review/text: I was really happy to find this tea available in a pack of six, subscribe & save, at such a good price.  We drink a lot of iced tea in our household, and the bargain price here on Amazon was a great find.  I brew it on the stove - plop 4 bags into my designated tea pan, heat it up 'til it almost boils, turn it off and let it steep until it's cool.  This makes a great gallon of tea - I usually leave it un-sweetened, but occasionally add a little honey for just a touch of sweetness.<br /><br />Note that the bags are pretty thin, much thinner than Lipton family size bags, so you'll need to be careful not to break them, or you'll end up with leaves in your tea!  Just be gentle, and you'll be fine (-:

review/text: I have been buying and trying different brands of beef jerky for a while now and this is easily one of my favorites!  The taste is delicious -- not too sweet and the spice mix has a kick to it which I love.  The texture of the beef is great and I cannot imagine this bag lasting very long.  Amazon, please get this back in stock!  Also, the price can not be beat -- all of the jerky I had in the past that was comparable in taste to this one has been exceedingly more expensive.  Overall, it's just delicious..plain and simple.

Maybe it's because there's too much brown sugar and not enough beef flavor. Or does the MSG have something to do with it?<br /><br />I just purchased some Pacific Gold jerky(which Amazon sells but I got it at Costco cheaper) and it has a lot more beef flavor and no MSG.

review/summary: Very Good Flavor - A Bit Tough
review/text: I was pleased with this jerky.  The price was less than most store bought jerky products which, in many cases, are over a dollar an ounce.  It has a wonderful flavor though it does have more calories than many products, likely due to the brown sugar.<br /><br />This jerky is a little tougher than some but certainly not overly so.  I did notice that in 15 degree weather it was very firm but most other brands are, too.  I just warmed it up and enjoyed the flavor as it softened in my mouth... When stored between 40 and 70 degrees it really was not much tougher than other similar offerings.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product for flavor and value.  it's nice to have a 12 ounce bag... I chomp through the smaller bags pretty fast.  12 ounces is good for snacks for a few days of camping.

If you don't care about the calories, then this is definitely tasty and you should buy it, but if you want less calories (1200 calories per bag vs 960 calories per bag) than "peppered" or "old fashioned" might be better choices.
