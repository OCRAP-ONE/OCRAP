review/summary: Super Yummy, Super Convenient and Organic!
review/text: This is one of those items I keep on my shopping list and buy a case of when the price drops on Amazon. It's not often carried in stores where I live and a delicious addition to meals.<br /><br />This polenta is pre-cooked, which means that the majority of the work involved with making the delightful stuff is done for you. In this case, it is done without adding a bunch of harmful ingredients too and it keeps the Organic seal. All you have to do is slice it and put it in your pan, brown and voila...perfect polenta.<br /><br />For those who've tried others and been less than satisfied (like I have) this brand doesn't crumble apart in the pan, has the "correct" texture and isn't unpleasantly mealy. My favorite is this one, Green Chili and Cilantro but the others are good too. This one goes well with traditional bacon and egg breakfasts and livens up an otherwise bland dinner of baked chicken breasts. It goes with just about everything.<br /><br />As far as pricing, at the time of this review the price is high again at $58.82 and that isn't a savings really. Put it in your shopping list and then watch, the price fluctuates and every once in a while, you can get the lot for under $30, which is a HUGE savings. It's worth it. Stores well, long expiration dates.

review/text: Green chili and polenta.. great combination.  But then.. green chili goes well with everything!!  I use a lot of polenta in my vegan cooking and this brand is my favorite.  I buy it by the case and it keeps well.  In fact.. I need to reorder some more right now!!

review/summary: rip-off!!!!  much bigger in the pictures
review/text: I was the recipient of the gift and it was a wonderfully thoughtful thing for the person to do for me since I like chocolate, but there was hardly anything in the basket.  How can the receiver tell the gift giver they are being deceived? The receiver MUST tell the gift giver how wonderful it is or risk being thought rude and ungrateful.  Since this comes through the mail as a gift, the giver would usually never see it.  This is set up as a rip-off situation. Don't order this!!!  The chocolates were nice but could be eaten in two small snack times -- and I'm a 130 lb woman, not a giant. One box had 3 small chocolates in it and another just 1. Not what you'd expect for $30 worth of chocolate.

review/summary: Should have read the reviews first
review/text: I was shocked when I received this gourmet chocolate gift.The worst part I ordered two to send as gifts. I'm really ashamed of the size and they are definitely overpriced.  I'm really disappointed with Amazon for using photography to make the items look much bigger than they really are. I wish I had read the reviews prior to my order. I order frequently from amazon. I guess I need to keep my purchases to books,cds and dvd's./

review/text: For $25 I expected more. The box is smaller than what it looks like in the picture and very plain. Maybe I just didn't read the description thoroughly but I am quite disappointed. There are only three small Godiva chocolates and the bag of "cashew crunch" is smaller than those mixed nuts that they give you on an American Airlines flight. Don't wast your money.

review/summary: Good tasting PB
review/text: I have purchased this product in the stores, but found the quantity vs. price to be a better deal on Amazon. I bought 6 of these jars (order quantity: 2), with free shipping. Good deal.<br /><br />For all my consumables I shop by labels. There is one other peanut butter, I have bought for years, which I like and is like 1 gram healthier according to my 'fat' standards, but that bran of peanut butter was discontinued stock at the grocery store I shop. Recently I viewed a personal trainer (Kevin Lisak) making a protein shake and he was using 'Teddie' peanut butter, so decided to go with this brand.<br /><br />Only 4-stars, because I realized after I purchased and received this item it did not contain flaxseed oil. Teddie 'does' make peanut butter with flaxseed. Also, it contains salt. For myself, I am not that concerned as much about salt as I am about the benefits of flaxseed. It would have been nice to have it included in the peanut butter I bought.<br /><br />Still, it's a good deal and Teddie peanut butter tastes like peanut butter should taste - like peanuts!

But again it is supply and demand... they have us over a barrell.

review/text: I love this stuff. It's perfect for movie night! Everyone I introduce it to falls in love with it. Unfortunately all of the grocery stores in Atlanta have stopped stocking it. It's probably because the price has gone up on it, the amount of popcorn in it has gone down AND it has gone down from 4 bags in a box to 3 bags in a box and now only 2 bags per box. It's still worth buying but because of the changes and the difficulty in finding it I eat it much less often than I did before.

review/summary: A sticky snack with an amazing taste
review/text: First off, note that this is one of those pour-over flavor packet types of popcorn.  Each box comes with two packets of the marshmallow flavoring, which doesn't especially taste like marshmallow, more like a watered-down cake icing.  The popcorn on its own seems to have a slight hint of marshmallow flavor, too. It's pretty much the best popcorn I've ever tasted, but its very sticky to eat... much more bothersome than the greasiness of pour-over butter popcorn, since most of that absorbs into the popcorn.  I just have to knock one star off the score because of the stickiness.

review/text: What the Amazon nutritional info does not show you is that this has 4g of trans fat per bag, which is a ton.  This is a very unhealthy product that is very bad for you -- stick with just about any other microwave popcorn on the market and you'll have zero or a miniscule amount of trans fat, which most companies have eliminated because it is so bad for you.

review/text: Not a big fan of flavored coffee...mostly I like my coffee bold, strong, and with just the right amount of fat-free 1/2 n 1/2 and sweetener (Splenda is my fave!)<br /><br />HOWEVER...a good cup of strong peppermint mocha coffee every now and then is nice, and I prefer the Coffee-Mate peppermint-mocha to the International Delight York Peppermint Patty brand...the Coffee-mate brand is more subtle, not as overpowering, and less sweet...allowing you to adjust your sweetener as needed...and PERFECT for the holidays...what goes better with your Christmas coffee than a creamer that tastes like a candy cane?!

review/summary: Not Just for the Holidays
review/text: I was so excited to find these in shelf-stable servings to keep in my desk at work.  Previously, I would just pretend not to notice the initials scrawled on the chance bottle someone kept in the fridge and sneak a little splash when nobody was looking.  I am not a big fan of most flavored coffee creamers, but when drinking cheap office coffee the peppermint mocha flavor is just sweet enough to take the edge off.  Perhaps the best feature--MUCH BETTER COFFEE BREATH.  Saying no more coffee breath wouldn't be entirely true, but it's pretty close in my opinion.  No longer do I have to alternate sipping water and coffee to drown out that acrid burnt flavor.<br /><br />So, for those of you who are like me (cheap, lazy, and guzzle down office coffee that has been sitting in a carafe all day), these little gems are the perfect way to take pleasure in caffeinating your day.

review/summary: Expensive But Worth It.
review/text: Even before I adopted my first cat, I'd been reading reviews about the best canned food out there for cats. Most sites seemed to recommend this brand. The price made me wince a little, but having compared the ingredients to those of brands that are cheaper, I think this product is a good investment. After all, we want what's best for our kitties, right? Those cheaper products might be more affordable, but the possible health problems from those ingredients aren't worth the money saved.<br /><br />Anyway, my cats LOVE this food. They lick their bowls clean, and they lick the serving spoon too. If even a little bit falls out of their bowls, they will lick it off. I have given them every flavour, and they aren't picky at all (apart from the Indoor Formula flavour-- they WILL eat it all but don't beg me for more). I am also comforted by the fact that you can look up each can of food on their website, and they will provide a report, analysing the food.

review/summary: Great for Elimination Diets/Chicken-Free!
review/text: I feed the Natural Balance Green Pea & Duck wet and dry food to my cat ever since my friends and vet suggested I do an elimination diet. Granted, my cat will eat anything in a can, I'm glad that Natural Balance has made this limited ingredient food so my cat doesn't have to suffer from his allergies to chicken. It is difficult to find cat food without chicken since it is in everything and the novel protein in Natural Balance's Limited Ingredient Diet is awesome!<br /><br />The dry Natural Balance Limited Ingredient Diet however, does have an ingredient that the canned wet food doesn't have: fish oil. So if you're doing a super stringent elimination diet, just compare labels for both the dry and wet because the ingredients do differ (my cat does fine with both).<br /><br />It has been several weeks now that my cat has been on the wet and dry NB food and his ear/face itching has almost completely disappeared! Just remember, talk to your vet about elimination diets if you think your cat may have allergies.

review/summary: the cat is responding well; can be purchased elsewhere
review/text: I have a cat with IBS.  While I had him on a food for sensitive stomachs, the vet recommended one that contained limited ingredients and ingredients he had not eaten before.  We went with the duck and pea canned food and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XS6RJW">Natural Balance Dry Cat Food, Limited Ingredient Diet Green Pea and Duck Formula, 10 Pound Bag</a>. The cat likes the dry cat food a great deal but the wet cat food is not his favorite.  Still, since this is all he gets now in the wet cat realm, he manages to eat it.<br /><br />Since putting him on this diet, I am not constantly cleaning up mounds of vomited food or dealing with utterly disgusting litter boxes.  He's more active and happy.  I attribute part of his new self to this food (as well as the small dose of steroids he receives each day).  As long as I feed him the right stuff and give him his medication, he is good to go.  If he sneaks into a different batch of cat food though, it is a terrible experience.<br /><br />I avoided a gradual transition to the food.  My cat's condition was getting to be so severe that I just picked a day to introduce him fully to it and he did not have any negative reactions.  In terms of consistency, I didn't find the food to be watery or dry.  There are no obvious peas or meat chunks.  It is well blended and looks like other wet cat foods I have purchased.<br /><br />I would recommend the Natural Balance line.  I would also recommend visiting your local pet food store to try out a few cans or bags of food before committing to a whole 24 cans.  Currently, my local Pet Supplies Plus has cans for about 1.38.  Petco has them for 1.58.  The price on dry cat food can be cheaper as well.<br /><br />The Natural Balance line is an investment but your cat's health and the time you save cleaning make the cost well worth it.

review/summary: Great For Cats With Food Allergies
review/text: I had my cat on one of Hill's Prescription Diets until she had a bad reaction to the food.  The prescription diet she was on used hydrolysed chicken protein to try and fool her system to try and avoid an allergic response.  It worked for a while but she eventually had a severe (and very scary) reaction to the food that led me to look for alternatives.  So far, this Natural Balance limited ingredient diet has been ideal.  The novel protein is much better than some engineered chicken protein, AND she loves it.  I just wish Amazon would offer the smaller cans.

review/summary: Much cheaper than prescription food, and every bit as good.
review/text: I discovered this cat food last year when we moved to a new state and I was running low on my cats special prescription food.  I figured I'd get it and until I could find the right vet it would do okay enough.  It already had good reviews.<br /><br />My cat had food allergies that caused some major skin reactions and was put on this restrictive diet a couple years ago.  No chicken, no grain, blah blah blah... all I heard was $50 for an 8lb bag of dry food?!#!?  Anyway, we'd seen how well she reacted to the prescription food and had that to compare with.  Our cat did start eating new bugs and probably grasses/plants when we moved to a new state so she had a flare up of her allergy, but when the weather cooled and those delicious distractions went away, the continued feeding of this Natural Balance food was able to get her back to normal.  Her digestion was never an issue with this food.  And my dogs and other cat seemed to prefer this over their own dry food.  So the taste was good apparantly, though I'll just take their word for it.<br /><br />Which, by the way, was my initial venture into this food - the dry variety.  But my cat was old and it was time to add the wet stuff.<br /><br />I am not reviewing the sellers here, as I have purchased this food in dry and both 3/6oz canned wet food from a couple different sellers.

review/summary: Duck & Pea--not for me!
review/text: This review is for the Duck & Pea and Venison & Pea formulas only.  I haven't tried the other Natural Balance formulas, though to be honest, I'm afraid to after the awful experience we had with these two formulas.  Both of these gave my cat terrible diarrhea and vomiting.  I initially wanted to try an allergy diet because my cat has itchy, waxy ears due to something--it's not mites so I thought maybe it could be allergies.  It made sense to me to try something grain free, with limited protein sources to rule out some things.  Unfortunately, the only conclusions I can draw from my experiment are that, either he's allergic to duck or venison (don't think so) or green peas (maybe?) or I got a bad batch, OR there's another ingredient that doesn't agree with him (carageenan? flaxseed?).  I did call the company, to see if they had any idea what was going on, and they recommended that we should keep trying and tough out the diarrhea for 4-6 weeks, until he 'adjusted.'  Yeah, right--like that wouldn't kill him from dehydration!  I hope this company takes reports like that seriously, I know they've had quality control issues in the past, and their foods were involved in the recalls.  My goal was to improve my boy's condition through diet, not put him in the hospital.  I'll be donating the rest of these cans to homeless animals, (and praying they can stomach it, 'cause I'm not 100% sure it isn't a bad batch).  Meantime, he's back on Eagle Pack Holistic canned foods, and feeling so much better.

review/summary: Hummus popped chips : Feta and Herbs
review/text: Ok I am going to say this with all due respect to our younger set of relatives living with us.  I don't know about you but my daughter seems to think every single item of food is for her.  "Who ate the rest of MY ice cream", now insert any word, cookie, doughnut, and chips.  Now I love the use of the word MY because if memory serves me right I don't see her opening the vault like wallet she has to pay for groceries... but I digress.<br />To with all respect yada yada yada, Buy these crackers and HIDE them. These are not to be wasted on the pallet of someone who thinks fruit roll ups are a serving of fruit. This is a very nice cracker and a welcome newcomer to the relative boring selection of salty snacks out there. You could easily serve this cracker without any topping with some pears, grapes or a nice sliced cheese. Hummus or Tabbouleh are also possible, but I would take very careful measures not to choose something that will mask the real and true flavor of the cracker.  This would also be wonderful with a wine pairing. I'm thinking a Riesling and some pears.  It would be a welcome treat during the games from chips and dip etc.<br /><br />I disclose that I received some of these snacks from Bzz Agent complimentary for review purposes.<br />Hope this helps and happy snacking.

They are diet friendly, healthier than regular chips, and full of flavor.  You actually get to eat more than regular junk food snacks - always a plus for a dieter! The biggest reason I love SMARTFOOD Selects - my always picky eater kiddos devoured them without even realizing they were eating a snack food that was not junked up with fat, sugars, and preservatives but that they were eating hummus chips.  I've tried sneaking hummus into our diets before with disastrous results!  Therefore, I would recommend people of all ages to try any and all of the SMARTFOOD products.  They have a great variety to satisfy all kinds of eaters and promote a satisfying snack for a healthier you.

review/summary: K-Paul's is THE BEST
review/text: We had heard of Paul Prudhomme many years ago and way back in 2000 we were able to spend a few days in New Orleans.  K-Paul's in the French Quarter is not to be missed (well, nor are half the restaurants there).  Soon afterwards we discovered Chef Paul's rubs in our local grocery store and were hooked, as we could duplicate at least some of the flavors.  IMHO Louisiana's Cajun food is the best cuisine in the US and stands on its own against any other cuisine in the world.  But you have to be ready for some very spicy food (which we love).  Chef Paul's Magic Seasonings captures a lot of that taste.  We use it almost daily on our grilled meats, and for a special treat on blackened red snapper.  It is really exceptional.  When our local store stopped carrying it I looked to Amazon and bought this.  Very happy with it!  No question, hands down, it is a 5-star product.

review/summary: Sugar-Free Green Tea Gum With a Slightly Minty Kick!
review/text: I chew gum with xylitol because it seems like a healthier sweetener than some of the other artificial sweeteners in other brands of chewing gum.  Plus, xylitol supposedly can help prevent cavities and I have read that it might even help reduce the incidence of certain kinds of ear infections.  Since the main reason that I chew gum is to help alleviate sinus/ear drum pressure from allergies, gum sweetened with Xylitol seems like a good choice to me since it may be helpful in preventing my recurring ear infections.<br /><br />The green tea flavor in this gum doesn't last long, but it tastes fairly pleasant.  There is another green tea flavored, xylitol-sweetened gum (Spry brand gum) on the market that looks like it may even be made by the same manufacturer as XyloBurst gum.  However, it seems to me that there were some differences between the two brands of gum when I compared them.  For comparison's sake, I thought that Xyloburst gum had a sharper (maybe mintier?) flavor than Spry gum.  I think that Xyloburst is also a softer, less "chewy" gum that seems easier on my jaw muscles than Spry gum.

review/text: I purchased these for my husband as he LOVES hot sauces but is also into the flavor of the sauce, not just the fact that it can turn your mouth to fire! These are AWESOME!  I like getting the pack of 6 b/c I like having the different options for different meals/foods.  We pair our hot sauces like some pair their wines. :P If you love hot and love flavor this is a great choice! I am ordering another 6 pack now due to the fact we have quickly gone through them all! :D

review/summary: Sooo Goood
review/text: I first tried this sauce on a trip to Belize.  It was a staple on the tables of every local restaurant.  It is one of my favorite hot sauces with real chili pepper taste and none of that vinegar flavor like what is in tabasco.

review/summary: Great sauce but know what you are getting before you order...
review/text: First of all let me say Marie Sharps is a fantastic do it all hot sauce, it works well in most if not all situations in which some more "heat" is needed. With that being said all this combo pack is the same sauce in bottles labeled differently, if I would have known this I would have just bought a larger bottle of their Habenaro pepper sauce and not six bottles of the same sauce at a much higher price. Also this merchant was pretty slow on the shipping side.

review/text: These candies are quite delicious. However, the price ($21.95) is ridicuous. I can buy them in NYC's Chinatown or in Brooklyn for about $7.00.<br /><br />UPDATE!!! The price has been reduced (from $21.95 to $16.59), but still much to expensive. I was in Chinatown yesterday (5-13-2012) , and bought TWO for $9.00.

It is easy to eat on the run and filling. These are different than the Sheffa Savory bars. This mix has more texture and flavors. I love that they are gluten free. I will continue to buy these snacks.

review/text: I don't often like "chocolate coffee", because I usually don't think the flavor or aroma really tastes or smells anything like chocolate.  This is the best I've tried, because it really does.  It is significantly better than other expensive brands I've tried in the past.  As the previous reviewer noted the kitchen smells great while it's brewing and it is very smooth.  Even my husband, who doesn't normally drink coffee, has some when I brew this.

I've been buying this coffee for over a year and my grocery store just stopped carrying them so I am buying from Amazon now.  When this coffee is brewing it smells like a chocolate cake is cooking!  It's so wonderful.  I like to make this coffee with the chocolate raspberry creamer, it tastes like a decadent, calorie-laden treat!

review/text: While this is not the best chocolate flavored coffee I've had, it's by far not the worst.  Amazon occasionally runs $10 off coupons for this item, in addition to it being on sale with super saver shipping.  This gets the price down to around $5 per pound.  This is a perfectly drinkable morning coffee for that price.  I drink a lot of coffee, between four and five cups in the morning, and I have not noticed a problem with acidity.  The best feature of this flavor is the aroma, distinctly chocolate, to the point that you are almost fooled into thinking you are going to be drinking hot chocolate.

review/summary: Drinkable, but not what I was expecting
review/text: For the money, I think this Folgers series of coffees is pretty tasty -- I've had 3 different ones now.  However, I was expecting a better chocolate flavor based on the other reviews it's received.  Though I typically like the bitterness of (dark) chocolates, this cocoa flavor has a slightly unpleasant bitterness to my buds -- It may even be a sourness -- I'm not quite sure yet.  Since I got it during a sale, I'm not too disappointed.  It's drinkable, but I plan to do some blending with other grinds, to see if I can subdue the odd flavor that comes through.

After trying a few other brands from online purchases that were a complete letdown, I have to say my tastebuds have been redeemed.  3 12oz bags for $16 and change is is good buy for flavored coffee.  I'll be back for more.  Thanks Folgers and thank you Amazon for providing customers a Folger's selection thanks really good.

I made the sample in my french brew and enjoyed every last drop. It's so  smooth yet robust. Normally, I buy JBM from the roasting company.JBM has a smooth flavor but this is just as smooth at a fraction of the price.

The smell/taste is identical to Tootsie Rolls, which is why I'm not head over heels for it lol I'd rather have a chocolate bar than a Tootsie Roll but its good none-the-less.

review/summary: An obsession satiated.
review/text: Let me begin by saying, I do not like mustard... but.. my husband loves "properly prepared" hamburgers. After a particularly good burger at sonic, he realized the mustard packet was from heinz. He requested a few more packets and then the taste tests and comparisons began.<br /><br />Every burger he ate, he checked to find out what kind of mustard it was. Many were heinz. Those that weren't, he complained that it wasn't good because it wasn't heinz. Even when his father, perhaps the best grillsman I have ever met, made burgers, they were insufficient to my husband. It became a quest to get him to eat one of his favorite foods (and to stop complaining). I searched. And searched. And searched. I even tried to buy one from a restaurant and was turned away (*sad sigh*). I enlisted the help of friends and family up to 1200 miles away to help find this elusive mustard.<br /><br />And then.. I could not believe my good fortune when I found this on Amazon. I thought to myself, 12 containers? How on earth could we use up 12 containers in ten months? But then I realized, it didn't matter. It was worth it. I gave two to my mother in law, four to my church and the rest to my husband as a quasi-joke Christmas gift. I think it may have been the best gift I've ever gotten him!

review/text: I have purchased many brands of jerky from Amazon including Oberto. This time what I received was 8 bags of jerky that was very close to inedible. I tried to eat it, but half of it went into the trash. It was'nt old or close to the expiration date, just dry and tough with an unpleasant stale taste. I have ordered Obertos in the past and it was okay, maybe this was just a bad batch. I won't be ordering it again.

review/summary: Should be against the law to sell
review/text: As others have stated, this product is not edible. It's past the pull date and should not even be available to sell. Come on Amazon, check into this product before someone gets sick.
