review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: This is the best produced jalapeno product on the market, IMHO. Unlike the cheaper, imported brands, these are crunchy, and somewhat milder. This product has a complex flavor profile. Instead of just a hot and vinegary flavor, the jalapeno flavor stands out. The balance of heat and jalapeno flavor just can't be beat. I eat these everyday, actually.

review/summary: The best jarred jalapeno peppers I've had to-date!
review/text: I consume mass quantities of sliced/pickled jalapeno peppers...I put them on and in everything, just about...so I can speak from experience ;-)<br />I have tried just about every jarred brand offered in our local stores; I also buy my own fresh jalapenos and parboil them and then pickle them in a vinegar/water/oil/salt brine from time to time.<br />These "tamed" peppers are much better than the other brands, and as good as anything I have self-jarred.<br />Why?<br />First, (according to their website) they had these hybrid peppers developed by Texas A&M to strip out some of the hotness, so the taste of the actual pepper comes through better.<br />Second, they have them grown in Northern California (think: domestic produce & US jobs!)<br />Third, they apparently do NOT use any artificial food coloring (aka FD&C Yellow 40 and the like)...just turmeric, which is a natural herb/spice.<br />Fourth, the slices are not soggy and have a nice crunch, as opposed to many other brands (as well as canned ones, which are practically always soggy).<br />Now, we have not bought these online yet, but we have started to consider it, because Mazzetta's full line is hard to find in our stores (CT/NY metro region)...<br />One note: apparently not ALL of Mazzetta's products are domestic and/or all natural (eg, they import some items from other countries, and some ingredients do contain artificial food coloring), but this does not apply to their "tamed" peppers...just a small caveat when looking at their full line.<br />Happy peppering!

review/summary: Spearmint licorice lover---terribly disappointed
review/text: I love spearmint licorice, especially the twisters and after a lot of research I was excited to find a site that was able to satisfy my yearning.<br />The packaging of the licorice was very flimsy, very hard to get off the licorice. Once you are able to get the thin cello off the licorice you are met with very hard, and impossible to take the licorice apart to eat. What little you could break off was hard and stale. Very disappointed in the product and am even more disappointed with the way the company has handled it (or I should say hasn't handled it) I contacted them and they haven't bothered responding to my correspondance. We paid a premium price for the licorice 8.99 a package and ended up throwing out the total product because it was simply unacceptable and impossible to enjoy. So, on two notes , I would be cautious about ordering from them, because there is a chance they won't bother to answer your correspondance and secondly the product they delivered us wasn't remotely like the old fashioned spearmint licorice that we enjoyed as kids. Be warned.

review/summary: Oily, yellow, and disgusting...
review/text: I recently created a candy buffet for 150+ people for a work event, and 2 items went over extremely poorly.  This was, by far, the worst.  The colors for the candy buffet were red, white, and blue - and these appeared to be white in the picture.  Unfortunately, they were not even close to white.  They were a sickly looking yellowish color instead.<br /><br />Because I didn't have a lot of time and I needed every item I had ordered, I went ahead and put these out (I stuck them in back behind some other stuff).  People still managed to find them, pick them up with disgusted looks, and laugh as they yelled things like "Who brought the rancid licorice??" and, "What the #*$ is this??"  It was an after-hours party, as you can probably guess :)<br /><br />The worst part is that the candy was extremely oily, and even at room temperature, it seemed to "sweat" even more oil.  I've never seen anything like it.  I'm not sure anyone ever got around to tasting them, but my guess is that they weren't good, given the odd smells and texture.

review/text: I tried these grapes at a spa called Chateau Elan in Ga. They had samples out. Needless to say I bought a big box of them and a smaller bag as a gift for a friend. The big box I kept for myself. I love the taste of these. The chocolate is so rich and the wine only makes the bite even better. The smaller bag I gave to my friend she fell in love with. She couldn't stop eating them. They are gluten free which adds a light more temptation to eat them. Great gifts and I think they would be great for a party mixer to have off to the side for guest to enjoy!... Yum....

review/text: The merger of wine grapes and chocolate had me anticipating a new high in my admittedly chocoholic life.  The price seemed a bit stiff but based on the description I sent away for multiple boxes for Christmas gifts.  Not one of my wiser choices.  If you bite into the confection expecting to come upon a liquid center you will be disappointed.  The experience is more like a chocolate-covered raisin. I give Bissinger's credit for a great idea but the the fruition fell short.

A friend gave me a jar, and I shared them with a friend a few nights ago. We ate half the bottle! You really can't stop yourself. They aren't super salty, so if that's what you're into, these won't work. But they are perfectly balanced flavorwise. Delicate and surprising. I say Get them! Can't wait for some more....so I'm getting the 12-pack!

review/text: Very sweet and delicious - rich and decedent - never new fig could be so wonderful!<br />I had to make a second matcha because I drank it so darned fast! My family was laughing at me when I began to make the second latte! They have seen me down matcha before but never quite as fast as this one!<br />Its sweet but not cloying whatsoever, tastes like something one picked fresh from the tree or ummm garden? Do figs grow on trees? I need to look that up! I have had fig only in a few forms before - jams, canned which were whole figs, and in puddings, but I am positive this is the best tasting fig ever for me!<br /><br />I think this may become one I keep as a permanent selection in my stash. I am not sure I would say it is better than macadamia nut or butterscotch but its up there with them maybe number 3 or 4 in my favorites. I have been drinking so many new ones as I collect them that I need to go back and try some of my first matcha again.<br /><br />I have also been sending out a ton of samples but its getting to that point I can't share as much anymore because my stash is beginning to thin lol.<br /><br />I'm at the place of deciding my favorites and keeping only those in stock. This will be one of those.<br />So I was surprised as I really did not expect to love this one quite so much, actually I thought I would probably not favor it but alas I do. Go fig!

review/summary: Not the best out there
review/text: I have been using stevia since the late 80's (yes, it was banned by the FDA at that time). Stevia has changed significantly over the years from the dark brown, licorice tasting product that sweetened wonderfully but definitely added its own flavor (was the only form available in the states), to the wide variety of products available today. This looked like a very good price, until I used it. I have to use 2-3X the amount to achieve the sweetness provided by KAL's powdered stevia, so it has turned out to be quite expensive.

review/text: I tried the simply asia hot & sour soup for the first time today, and it was pretty good.  To be honest I found the soup to be neither hot nor sour, it was actually pretty sweet.<br /><br />So I decided to doctor it up by adding some lemon juice and some hot sauce to make it more hot and sour, and then it was a lot better. I also added some more veggies, tofu, and an organic egg to make it more hearty and filling.<br /><br />This soup is actually pretty high in fiber (8 grams) compared to regular ramen, and it's much lower in sodium (570mg).  So while the overall flavor was decent, the nutritional value of this ramen is better than most I have tried.<br /><br />Over all I think this soup was pretty enjoyable.  It's not nearly as cheap as regular ramen, but it has NO MSG, more fiber, and A LOT less sodium. It is also vegan.<br /><br />I would purchase this soup again.  To be honest, my personal favorite natural soup bowl is Annie Chun's Kimchi Soup, so if you are a die hard fan of ramen, but want to make a healthier choice, I would start with that one.

review/text: I have tried a few of the Simply Asia bowls, and find this to be one of the best they offer. It's a quick "meal in a kit" (and it *is* a kit that requires some assembly) that comes complete, right down to a spoon. The best part? The noodles aren't dry; they are "fresh" udon noodles in a vacuum bag, along with freeze-dried vegetables, an envelope of dried spices and a packet of sauce. Though the instructions call for microwaving the bowl, in a pinch, I have been able to make the soup adequately with boiling water from a teakettle.<br /><br />Though this will never be mistaken for hot & sour soup from a good Chinese restaurant, it's a rather delicious and easy lunch or late night snack that is surprisingly satisfying. It's definitely worth keeping a few bowls tucked away in your desk drawer or kitchen cupboard, and Amazon's price for six bowls is much more cost effective than buying them in the grocery store. Thanks, Amazon!

review/text: I was really blown out of the water by this ice cream. I mean, Schwans is usually pretty high quality so no surprise there, but its the attention to detail that really makes this flavor pop.<br /><br />First, the pumpkin flavor is a bit milder than I thought it would be while still being quite distinct, and from other pecan-based ice creams I've tried from Schwans they seem to have a way of making the pecans taste very fresh... I'm not sure what they do to them (perhaps toasting?) but other companies could learn from them in that respect.<br /><br />It is the flavored syrup that really makes this ice cream shine. It tastes deeply of cinnamon and nutmeg, which makes the whole thing taste like pumpkin pie!<br /><br />Since it wasn't advertised that way it caught me by surprise in the best way possible.

review/text: This is a very good product for any price. People knock it a bit because of the corn but I've spoken to Eagle Pack and have found they are very open about their product. Carbohydrates are carbohydrates are carbohydrates. No cat needs them. Ever! Apparently the grains used in this product are local to Indiana and surrounding areas (Michigan, Illinois, Ohio)? That's never a bad thing as far as I'm concerned. I've also read the company is non-GMO but I haven't confirmed that information through e-mail. The point is that unless your pet is allergic to corn or rice you're wasting your time going grain free. Potatoes and peas are just as useless as corn or rice and cats would never eat any of these in the wild. So if you want a food that is locally sourced (for the most part) and don't want to pay twice as much for Orijen simply because they use peas and potatoes this is a great option.

I didn't even finish the sample before I ordered more.  I have been sharing this with anyone who is interested.<br /><br />I tried Pero, and I thought it tasted like sunflower seeds, plus it has MSG in it.  Ayurvedic is all organic and contains no MSG and tastes VERY much like coffee.  Customer Service is extremely friendly and helpful, and I look forward to being a long time customer.  [...]

review/summary: The best substitute coffee I have tried.
review/text: I have never really thought much of substitute coffee.  Actually I am pretty picky even with real coffee, unless it's really good fresh roasted organic espresso.  But the Ayurvedic Roast is something else.  It has a rich round flavor that is significantly better than anything else i have tried.<br /><br />Thanks for creating such a great product

review/summary: Beyond Shocked!!
review/text: Okay,okay.. I must admit, I was skeptical. After years of drinking coffee and than having to stop....oh my goodness, I thought I'd have a melt down. I tried several coffee alternatives and each time I was so disappointed, so much so that I gave up looking; knowing that I'd have to get use to drinking Pero, you feel my pain, right?<br />Last week I was introduced to Ayurvedic. I was BEYOND SHOCKED! Can I just tell you, it was like an answer to prayer. Seriously, this coffee alternative is so close to the "real" thing that if I were blindfolded, I don't know that I could tell the difference.<br />Thanks Ayurvedic for restoring my faith.

review/summary: Unbelievable - I do believe it would pass for coffee...
review/text: I had to give up coffee some years ago when I became caffeine sensitive.<br /><br />That was hard - I really loved my morning ritual of deciding what I was in the mood for, grinding the beans, boiling the water, running it through my old drip-cone straight into the cup.  Ahh, what I wouldn't give for a handful of half Illy and half New Mexico Pinon Roast, ground as fine as it will go, brewed strong, and sipped black.  Coffee drinkers will understand.<br /><br />I have since found any number of other things to drink, but still miss my coffee sometimes.  For a while, I tried decaf, but yuck.  I found a perfect decaf tea (PG Tips decaf is indistinguishable from the regular tea), and have come to enjoy a number of herbals and other brews, but have never a decent decaf coffee or coffee substitute.<br /><br />I found this stuff by accident online and bought a sample out of curiosity.  I liked that it was organic, and there's nothing in the ingredients that turned me off.  I really didn't expect it to be anything like coffee (they never are), but I thought it might be good in its own way.<br /><br />When the sample showed up, I ran a cup through my old drip-cone, and it was just ok.  A little watered down - I think I didn't use enough for the big mugful of water.  The funny thing though, was that it tasted like watered down coffee.  Just the way coffee used to taste when I didn't use enough for the amount of water.<br /><br />Second cup I used two big spoonfuls directly in the water and boiled it for 5 minutes.  After a minute or two, it started to smell like... well, coffee.  When poured, it had the same dark brown color and opaqueness I remember, and suddenly I was holding a cup of coffee.  I drank it black.  It was a passable cup - very satisfying - I actually stood there and gulped it down in the kitchen.<br /><br />It's smoother than I remember coffee being, less "bite" - probably because it doesn't have the same acids and oils that coffee does - but it does have a comparable taste and richness.  I never really liked flavored coffees, but the vanilla is very light - more a scent than a taste - and doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />In fact, if you'd handed me a cup of this when I could still drink coffee, I might have looked at it sideways and asked where you found such a smooth roast, but I wouldn't have questioned that it WAS coffee.<br /><br />That's pretty impressive - kudos to whoever developed this stuff.  Don't know how they did it, but I'll keep on drinking it.  I also look forward to giving it to some coffee drinking friends and waiting until after they drink it to mention that it isn't coffee =o)

review/text: I gave up coffee about six months ago and had been drinking various types of teas and herba matte since then. I stumbled across Ayurvedic Roast on line and decided to order a bag to see if I liked it. Like it? I love it! I really like coffee and don't mind tea but one thing I really missed with tea was the full body texture of a cup of coffee. Ayurvedic Roast comes very close in texture and I really enjoy the flavor. Just ordered myself a 4lb. bag so I don't have to worry about running out anytime soon.

Where Ayurvedic Roast is different, is that I really enjoy drinking it; it has a wonderful vanilla aroma, and a deep rich flavor.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, my mom, who very much _is_ a coffee drinker actually really likes it too, so I always make sure to keep a good amount in stock in case she comes by :)

review/text: I can't drink coffee anymore because I have a caffeine allergy, so I was hoping to find a product that had a similar taste to coffee that I could sip on throughout the day.<br /><br />I've tried a few similar products, but this is the best.  Does it taste like coffee?  Put it this way... if you walked outside your house and saw an elephant doing back flips while drinking Ayurvedic Roast, your focus would remain on the elephant instead of thinking "what is in my coffee cup?".<br /><br />I guess a more useful analogy is, it's like a veggie burger vs. a real burger.  You need to treat the two separate.  I like veggie burgers, but I don't order one if I feel like a hamburger.  Temper your expectations with this product and you'll really enjoy it.  I drink it with a little bit of milk and a splenda.  I'm looking forward to trying it iced.

review/summary: Good for you, but does not smell or taste like any coffee
review/text: I really wanted to like this stuff because I need to cut down on coffee consumption. I was very excited to receive this "coffee." The minute I opened the bag I noticed it smelled nothing like coffee at all. It was interesting to recall that one of the reviewers stated in a blindfolded taste test you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and real coffee. Hmmmmm. Anyway, I made it exactly like I make my regular coffee, and it tastes nothing like any coffee I have ever tasted anywhere (and I've had my share of desperation java in the past). I was very disappointed in the taste.<br /><br />The flavor is not really "bad," just totally different from that rich coffee aroma and taste. It looks like coffee, though. What I ended up doing is mixing it with regular coffee. This helped a lot, and it reduced my intake of cafffeine and acid. It tasted okay mixed with regular coffee, and that's what I will probably do in the future. Will I buy it again? Probably. If I feel okay and my symptoms improve I will try to stick with it. Like I said, it's not bad, just different. It is possible I will get used to the taste.<br /><br />I did a lot of research on the ingredients in this product. They can be good for your heart and help you feel calm. This could be a good thing. I just wanted to take the time and post about the taste and aroma.

review/summary: Not the best in my opinion.
review/text: This coffee alternative is not my favorite. It has a funny aftertaste like burnt bread. But if you are a black coffee addict and like the taste of old black joe, this is probably your best bet. I myself have never cared for the taste of unsweetened, uncreamed coffee anymore than I prefer unsweetened cocoa. To me, it's not good coffee unless it tastes sweet and creamy. I realize that this is not what most coffee hounds prefer, but I also know that a lot of us like cream and sugar in some degree. Another problem with this otherwise excellent blend of roasted grain and herbs, is that it soaks up a lot of water and tends to clog paper filters, not allowing all of the hot water to brew through to the cup. It swells up quite a bit more than coffee, and tends to overwhelm paper filters.<br /><br />One of the best alternatives to coffee, but not the best I've tried.

review/text: My Mother-in-law loves her morning coffee.  Because of medical conditions she could not have caffeine at all, which the products for non-caffeine on the market do contain caffeine.  We found Postum on line, which just did not do the trick and is very expensive.  We tried another substitute which was barely better.  When I ordered the substitute from Ayurvedic it was a big hit once I adjusted the amount.  She loves it and is now enjoying the start of her day with a good tasting coffee drink.  Thank you Ayurvedic!!! I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for an excellent coffee taste with no caffeine.  Charlene Bedaw

review/summary: Great taste - close to coffee
review/text: I ordered this for my husband who is trying to quit coffee. I didn't like the taste of several of the other coffee replacemenents that I tried on Amazon.<br /><br />I wanted to see if he could tell the difference between this and his regular coffee.<br />I brewed a cup for him, and he remarked,"oh, is this some new brand of coffee?".  He really thought it was regular coffee!<br /><br />Someone here mentioned that it tastes like weak coffee, but I think they just need to adjust the amount when brewing. I used 1 tablespoon to one cup of water, and that proportion suited my husband well (he doesn't like his coffee too strong).<br /><br />Obviously this didn't taste 100% like coffee...after all, this is a coffee substitute, made from grains and herbs and not real coffee beans. However, I was satisfied and would recommend it to my friends who are trying to quit coffee.<br /><br />I brew this for myself with milk and sweetener, and I'm not claiming to be a coffee house gourmet, but it tasted just like a real latte to me!

review/text: After reading the reviews I was excited to try this coffee substitute. When I received it I tried to brew a cup in my keurig k-cup. It would not brew in the k-cup, I think its too dense when it gets wet.  So I then tried it in a regular coffee maker.  I followed the directions on the bag and the beverage came out weak.  It was undrinkable. So I tried the coffee maker again, but this time I added extra grounds and it still came out weak.  Last I tried my French Press and it worked pretty good. The taste is not bad, its similar to coffee, but it does have an aftertaste. Whats missing is the bitterness in coffee that I like. I actually prefer Teeccino over this.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Perfect
review/text: The peppermint pig has become a fun tradition for our family at Christmas, and the velvet bag and hammer that come with it are useful all year!!!  If your family has no traditon, other than thanking God for the birth of Christ, this, this is something you might want to try. After our meal when we are all settle into the family room to watch the children open their gifts, we place the peppermint into the velvet bag and break it up with the small metal hammer. As each child has their turn to open their gifts (we start with the youngest and right up the line to the oldest) they each get a piece of the peppermint pig and then the adults share the rest with their coffee. Try it, you will love it! The kids never get too old for this tradition.

review/summary: Check the EXPIRATION DATE!!!!
review/text: These candies are great if they are NOT expired. I have ordered these candies from several different sellers on multiple occasions and I have consistently received expired products. Additionally, some sellers put company stickers over top of the expiration date so you can't tell when the product expires. Beware of the following sellers as I have had trouble with each of them: Toys Samurai, ABCTOY4me and ToysDiva. I have reported each of them to Amazon (4 different complaints in the past 4 months) and Amazon has done nothing to stop them from sending out expired products or products with hidden expiration dates. Good luck.

review/summary: Made my dog sick....
review/text: I bought a bag of Chewy Louie for my dog (cause he was a good boy all week).  I rarely stray from his regular food, but I thought he earned a treat.  I gave him one strip in the evening before putting him to bed, and when I woke up to check on him, he was in the corner, and there was poop all over the place.  It was runny, and just an utter mess.  I hate to blame the product, but there was nothing else. I took him to the vet, and the vet said it must have been something in the food i gave him.  I will never purchase this product, not recommend it to any dog owner.

review/summary: Hazelnut Milka is Delicious
review/text: Milka and its famous purple cow, recently purchased by Kraft, is an eastern European chocolate originally produced in Switzerland and is available in Germany, Austria, Hungary and other nearby countries. With hazelnut, the crunch and flavor has a pleasant exotic texture.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavor is not subtle. For me, this is a good thing, and, as a result, I can devour two bars faster than I should.<br /><br />Distribution is still weak in the United States, but can be found increasingly in larger cities. Usually, then, it is found only in international grocery stores, though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time. It has been around 100 years. Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen. For now, the texture and taste are better than Hershey's and Nestle. It is a smoother, creamier basic chocolate, although they also make varieties which include yogurt, nuts and a version with Oreo Cookies. Buy a case of the hazelnut Milka and enjoy!<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, http://HungarianBookstore.com

review/summary: High Quality dog food!
review/text: I have fed my dogs this food for over 12 months -- they love it and have no problems with digestion.  I also feed my cats weruva brand food -- they love it as well. Online reviews of this product give it consistently high marks.  Sorry that some of the amazon labels have been misleading -- i.e., showing pictures of cat food when searching for dog food.  However, with the exception of one ingredient (taurine is added for cats), the cat and dog food ingredients are pretty much the same.  This food costs a bit more than grocery store brands, however it contains fresh ingredients -- no grains are included.  Grains are often the cause of allergy and digestion problems.  It is prepared in a "fit for human consumption" approved manner.  Since feeding my pets this food, their coats have become soft and shiny and their eyes are bright and clear.  It is my opinion that in the long run, the possibility of fewer physical problems resulting in fewer vet bills, make feeding my pets weruva food very cost effective.<br /><br />Please folks, post reviews that are about the quality of the product. It is misleading to post a 1 star review because amazon mislabeled a product.  Some people might bypass a product based on a star rating without actually reading the review.

review/summary: Recipe has changed and our pets only give it 3 stars now. This used to be their favorite.
review/text: Well, Weruva had the magic formula in the past. Their Marbella Paella was at THE very top of our pets' list of favorite foods and they eat about 10-12 different brands/flavors of canned foods, all premium brands without grains and crap fillers. The old Marbella Paella recipe and the new both had mackerel as the primary ingredient and water as the second ingredient. The previous recipe, which is still what's incorrectly printed in Amazon's description as of this writing, contained calamari, shrimp and mussels as third, fourth and fifth ingredients. Now calamari, shrimp and mussels are entirely absent in any amount from Marbella Paella. If you ask me, this is such a fundamental change in the recipe that it constitutes deceptive marketing for returning customers like myself. And I DO feel deceived.<br /><br />And there is no question that our pets notice the change. They used to DEVOUR the previous Marbella Paella and leave cleaned bowls behind and ask for seconds. Now they walk away leaving their bowls half full the way they do with non-Weruva brand foods. Sure, they'll eventually come back and finish up. And that's how they generally are with their other foods. So no, they don't dislike the new recipe. They just seem rather indifferent.<br /><br />It is VERY disappointing how far from grace this recipe has fallen. From paragon to mediocrity in one shot. Lame.<br /><br />Hey, Weruva, change the name of this product or restore the previous recipe. It ain't cool to ride the success of your previous recipe and deliver this sorry impostor in its place. Talk about a LITERAL bait and switch. Very uncool...<br /><br />Still, most other truly premium pet foods that have healthy ingredients and are void of grains and preservatives, etc. typically get snubbed by our pets and the new Marbella Paella still does actually get eaten so it gets 3 stars whereas other premiums typically get 1 or 2 stars because our pets simply won't eat them. The original Marbella Paella, of course, would have gotten 6 stars if Amazon would allow that extra star.<br /><br />Sad... but at least the little ones still eat it...

review/summary: Tired of plain water? Enjoy this lemonade on the go
review/text: I love lemonade but 2-3 in one day is too much sugar. Crystal Light is a nice replacement. I drink more of this in the summer than Crystal Light's peach tea.<br /><br />The On-The-Go packages are easy to carry and I keep a box at my office and several packets in my glove box. I've reviewed several of the Crystal Light and Lipton drink mixes. My favorite flavors are iced tea, peach tea, lemonade and raspberry lemonade. All of these are a nice change of pace from drinking plain water and I've found that I enjoy them best when they are slushy cold.<br /><br />Here's my recipe for a perfect drink: I add the drink mix packet to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVMTP8">Rubbermaid Chug Bottle</a>, an inexpensive water bottle perfect for Crystal Light and Lipton packets. Then, I add 12 oz of water and fill the rest of the bottle with crushed ice. After 30 seconds of shaking I've got an ice-cold drink.<br /><br />Bottom line: Are you tired of drinking plain water all the time? You can save money by skipping bottled teas. These drink mixes are handy at home, at the office and on the road - anywhere you want to avoid drinking your calories.<br /><br />Crystal Light On the Go, Peach Tea<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E55XNE">Crystal Light Ice Tea On-The-Go</a><br />Crystal Light Raspberry Lemonade On-The-Go<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ52CU">Crystal Light On the Go, Green Tea Raspberry</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ODDU1Y">Lipton White Tea Iced Tea Mix To-Go, Raspberry</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PE4">Lipton Green Tea To Go, Mandarin and Mango</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ODC3TY">Lipton Green Tea Iced Tea Mix To-Go, Citrus</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMD1MS">Lipton Green Tea To Go, Honey & Lemon</a><br />Crystal Light On the Go, Raspberry Ice

One pack of this in a standard-size bottle of water & it's perfect!  Not too sweet....not too tart.  Because it's more difficult to dissolve in cold water, I tend to make up a few of these with room temperature bottled water...then place the mixed bottles in the refrigerator to chill.  That way, I can take the bottles on-the-go cold.  5 stars to Crystal Light for their Natural Lemonade flavor!

review/text: Till I tasted this product in the big C warehouse I never thought it would taste as good as it does. I kept it would taste rather unnatural like kool-aid. But one sip and I was hooked.<br /><br />It is a great replacement for all the diet soda I was drinking. This somehow seems much healthier and has less caffeine. One pack is perfect for a bottle of water. I am trying to not buy too many PET bottles nowadays due to recycling issues so I just carry a water bottle and keep adding this pack, it is a good way to drink water.<br /><br />I was noticing that with diet soda I felt dehydrated often and I was getting headaches, recently I also learned that diet cola is particularly bad for the system so it was time to switch. This flavor is particularly nice as it tastes just like fresh lemonade. I also bought raspberry lemonade but did not like that one as much as this flavor.

review/summary: Love this lemonade
review/text: On a diet and want to drink a lot of water. I bought the 32 ounce Contego water bottle on Amazon (highly recommend that as well). Now I fill to 32 oz line and put in two of these packets. Shake it up and I am drinking a quart of no calorie delicious lemonade.

review/text: Absolutely love this stuff.  I carry it around with me when I want something to add to my water.  Packets are convenient.  The price cannot be beat on amazon as they sell for more in the stores.  This is my favorite flavor and I am on auto ship so I never run out.

review/summary: Great if you add regular club soda... makes it taste like grape soda
review/text: Add some club soda to this and you have yourself a grape soda. The other flavor that is great with club soda is pomegranite/cherry (note: not all crystal light flavors are good with club soda - experiment). But these are my favs.

review/summary: Great flavor, but
review/text: the number one ingredient -- literally -- is high fructose corn syrup.  And that really sucks because this is otherwise great sauce.  It taste great and it easy to cook with, and everyone loves it.<br /><br />But I just will no longer consume products with HFCS.  I'm begging Sweet Baby Ray's to sell a version that is HFCS free.<br /><br />Kraft's Bull's Eye brand contains no HFCS and this is a point of pride for them.  Sweet Baby Rays can do the same.  PLEASE

review/summary: New favorite
review/text: This is my new favorite bbq sauce. Just the right balance between sweet and spice with a touch of smoke. A bit sweeter than many sauces, but it works on whatever's heading to the grill. But the price is up $12 per 6 18-oz bottle since August. (It's now mid-October.) That doesn't make me happy, since it's now nearly twice as much as my old favorite. That's a big jump. Argh . . . check the discount stores for a better price right now. Saying that kills me since I'm a huge Amazon fan, but money is money. And good bbq is a year-round pleasure.

review/summary: Tasty Little Devils
review/text: I got a freebie sample pack in a store and these were very tasty.  I would certainly buy them.  They were little circles, about 1 inch in diameter, with minimal salt and some seeds.  They made a nice, tasty, satisfying little snack.  They look like baby frisbees--WooHoo!<br /><br />The ingredients are listed as: sunflower seeds, wheat flower, whole wheat f vital wheat gluten, expeller pressed high olec sunflower oil, chicory root fiber, organic evaporated cane juice, sea salt.

review/summary: Superb Seasoning Mix
review/text: This seasoning mix has been used by our family for over 40 years.  Each foil packet is all you will need to add a dimension of flavor to a pound of frozen vegetables.  Or, it makes a satisfying cup of broth.  For cooking, try adding it to your homemade soups when, "It needs something...."  I wouldn't think of making gravy without it.  And I'm willing to share a recipe with you that everyone asks for, after tasting my Middle Eastern salad dressing.  It too, uses G. Washington seasoning.  To a large bowl of salad for 4:<br /><br />Pour on 1/4 cup good olive oil.  Add:  1 packet G. Washington mix; 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper; 1 teaspoon granulated garlic; 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano; 1-2 teaspoons dried mint; and FRESH lemon juice, to taste.  Toss well and serve immediately.<br /><br />G. Washington is excellent added to chicken or turkey stuffing (dressing).  It's a good seasoning for beef, fish, and poultry.<br /><br />It's my 'go to' secret ingredient.  Try it!

review/summary: Delicious Seasoning Packets
review/text: Both the Brown and Golden George Washington broths are the "go-to" mixes for my family when a seasoning packet is required, or in place of a bouillon cube in a recipe. My family has found the Brown to be a great addition to baked dishes, while the Golden broth is best for lighter soups. We always keep at least a box of both varieties in our spice cabinet. It isn't overly healthy, but the foods it makes are delicious.<br /><br />Our favorite use for the Brown George Washington broth mix is for a vegetarian dish called Cottage Cheese Roast. Here is the basic recipe. You can include other seasonings and things like diced peppers, celery and minced garlic for added flavor and texture.<br />------<br /><br />1 (16 ounce) carton cottage cheese<br />4 eggs<br />1/4 cup vegetable oil<br />1 envelope George Washington Broth<br />1 cup finely chopped walnuts or pecans -- almonds also work<br />1 1/2-2 1/2 cups Special K or Corn Flakes<br />1/4 cup chopped onion<br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />  1. Preheat oven to 350 F degrees.<br />  2. Grease a loaf pan (sesame seed oil works well).<br />  3. In a large bowl, combine cottage cheese, beaten eggs, vegetable oil, soup mix, nuts, cereal, onion and any other ingredients.<br />  4. Ladle into prepared pan.<br />  5. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes.<br />  6. Let the 'roast' rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.<br /><br />Leftovers work well on sandwiches too. We've only recently found these at local Publix stores, so are very happy to see them offered on Amazon. Enjoy!<br /><br />~ Kort
