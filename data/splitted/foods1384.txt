review/summary: Good Food Arf!
review/text: This was a good buy and cheaper than I could get in the store.  It arrived when I expected it to and I didn't have to drive to the store, fight the traffic getting across town, try to find a parking space in front of the pet store, wait in line at the register and lug a big heavy bag home.  How great is that??  My lab loves this food...I've been feeding it to her for about 6 months but she hasn't lost any weight yet...Guess I need to give her more exercise for that to happen...where's that leash.......

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: My Dobie was on an Iams schedule until I read some articles that were not favorable toward Iams. I decided to switch to the outrageously high priced Natural Balance and purchased the regular formula. My Dobie went beserk when he got a sniff of what I was putting into his bowl and tried to get to the contents before I could place the bowl in its stand. He immediately gobbled it down in a NY minute. Unfortunately, he started gaining weight and the vet said he needed to lose it. So I switched to the reduced calorie formula. My Dobie hates this reduced formula with a purple passion. He will not touch it until he just can't go any longer without some food. If I put something like a tablespoon of beef bullion on the food he will sometimes eat it all up. This is somewhat like priming a pump. I don't believe there is anything wrong with the food per se but it just does not have an appeal to my Dobie and thus the 3 stars. I am going to switch to another formula that has flavor without the excessive calories - just like for humans - yeah, right.

review/summary: Delicious blend and highly recommended!
review/text: A wonderful mild blend with a hint of orange flavor. Not a strong, tart orange taste, just a subtle taste and aroma. It has a refreshing flavor and makes for a great afternoon tea.<br /><br />I have found that most people that I have served this to tend to then want this blend again when they are offered tea by me. It's one of everyone's favorite teas and I highly recommend it!

review/summary: My new favorite tea
review/text: I purchased this as a loose tea when I was up in Newport, RI and it is now my favorite. It has a nice blend of orange, spice, and a hint of cranberry that is surprisingly tasty without adding any sugar or cream (and I am a HUGE fan of sugar or honey in my tea) and I love that it is caffeine free. I still like to add some honey to mine, but it doesn't take much. Thank goodness it's available online because I am almost out!

review/summary: Our favorite tea
review/text: I first tried this tea at Einstein Bros. Bagels, and it is the only tea the we drink now. It has the greatest flavor, and is the finest tea that I have ever tasted. I have offered it to many friends that do not like tea and they have tried it and loved it. We all like it without cream or sugar, the flavors are so rich and vibrant that it easily stands on its own.<br />Harney & Sons even somehow got my boyfriend off of soda, he bought a bunch of different flavors and has them with his meals instead now. They compliment meals very well, and are a wonderful way to start your day and unwind in the evenings.

review/summary: It was just so-so.
review/text: I bought two of these based on the description and existing reviews.  It smells alright but the orange wasn't fruity enough and the rooibis wasn't "earthy" enough. There was something in the balance of the two that just didn't trip my trigger. I wish I'd been as pleased with this blend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NKEXBO">African Autumn, 20 Sachets in tin by Harney & Sons</a> as earlier reviewers clearly were. Mind you, I adore H&S chocolate mint, many of their other teas and plain rooibos from other 4-5 tea companies. If it helps, I don't add tea or cream to my teas -- except when I go out for English Tea (PG Tips) at my favorite tea house. I also adore plain green tea, Red Rose black tea, Earl Grey, Rooibos with Asian Pear, plain rooibos and many other teas without cream or sugar.  I'm usually very good at reading ingredients and envisioning what a tea will taste and smell like --that's why I risked buying 2 tins. Part of what threw me was the name of the blend -- "African Autumn". Somehow I thought there would less of the orange flavor and more of an earthy-nutty flavor. No, I have no idea where that "made up in my mind" combo would have come from.  Maybe they should have called this, "fall fruit basket"  or something. The tea is not so unpleasant that I won't finish it. I'll have a few more mugs and see if I grow to like it but unlike my yummy chocolate mint, I'll definitely give plenty of my remaining 37 bags of "African Autmmn" away one bag at a time. I hope that you enjoy it more than I did.

review/text: We like that it's organic, we like that it's whole grain BROWN rice.  Take a look at labels on other rice milk products -- these are two things that you don't often see.  Finding these two things together in one product, has made this our favorite milk by far.  All three of our boys love it, even mixed with unsweetened soy milk to cut down the sugar.  Highly recommend for anyone who wants or needs to avoid dairy.

review/summary: Excellent rice milk product around but no info on rice origin and lead levels
review/text: My weaning 2-year-old rejects all other animal and non-dairy milk. This is the only rice milk she asks for. It does not have canola oil listed as an ingredient which I appreciate. I also love that it is organic and brown rice. But I must take back one star because I tried twice contacting the company regarding the level of lead in their rice used for this product. They never replied and it seems the only contact for the company is the president's lawyer which doesn't look good. Also I found a violation against them for representing a product as organic when it was not. I could not find any details on this violation. My confidence in the product was so shaken I ended up tossing my last 12-pak of it until I can find more information on WHERE the rice comes from and how MUCH lead it contains before I give it to my toddler. I was looking for a post-Fukushima alternative to milk since that is still radioactive on the west coast but I have not found a substitute so I have gone back buying pre-Fukushima powdered milk which is a chore to mix.

review/summary: A pleasant surprise!
review/text: I developed a dairy sensitivity about 10 years ago and have been searching for a non-dairy alternative to milk for 10 years.  I first settled on soy milk, but recently developed a sensitivity to soy as well.  For the past year, I've been sampling the various dairy alternatives and haven't been overly impressed with any of them.  I recently heard about Good Karma's Rice Milk and decided to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised. The consistency is better than the other rice milks I've tried.  No, it doesn't have the same consistency as milk, but it's far less "watery" than other rice milks I've sampled.  The flavor is pleasant and mild (i.e., not overly sweet, like some other products on the market).  Pair good consistency and flavor with the fact that it's organic and whole grain, and you've got one happy customer!  Also, to note, I just noticed this company offers a flax milk.  I'm anxious to try that product as well!

review/summary: It's healthy
review/text: This is a wholesome beverage for drinking and on cereal.  I have been using Silk soy milk for coffee and tea and when I saw this rice milk which IMO is a better food to put in my body than soy milk, and for less that what I pay for Silk, I thought I'd give it a try.  For coffee and tea is is not even half as creamy as Silk so it falls short there.  I had figured it would be a thinner product but since Amazon's nutritional data stated 80 calories per cup, as opposed to 100 per cup of Silk, I figured I could use a bit more rice milk to make up for it's more watery consistency.  Well turns out Amazon's data is wrong, the rice milk has 100 calories per cup also.  There are other discrepancies between Amazon's data and what is printed on the box.  So it's a good product and I like the taste although I prefer the less sweet original version of Silk.  I will happily use my 12 cartons of this rice milk but will go back to Silk when it's all gone.

review/summary: Arsenic found on Rice Milk
review/text: After all the recent news about high levels of Arsenic found on rice, and a consumer report that says that children under 5 years of age should not drink rice drinks, we were very concern since my 21/2 year old son only drinks this product. We called Good Karma to hear what they had to say, and they were not very convincing at all. They should have a press release or something strong enough to calm parents and make them feel that this is not going to cause any harm. But they don't. The person we talked to wasn't very effective in communicating so we will just toss the boxes we had left from the last order, and switch to some other knid of milk..... sad to do, since he loves it, but better to do it now, than regret it later. Hey, it's my baby, the love of my life, I won't give him ANYTHING that might be poison. Come on!!! would you??????

review/text: My wife is Russian and knows a lot of European friends. Recently, we had a birthday party for our 2-year-old boy and somebody brought a packet of 8 Kinder Chocolate Bars, probably knowing that my wife preferred European candies to most American ones. These Kinder Bars were made in Poland. They are much less sweet than American candies. An individual bar is about 2 inches long and about a half inch wide. It is further subdivided into smaller bites. I can't tell you how many because they're all gone. Yum. Externally, they're covered with chocolate and they have a white creamy center. It says a serving is two bars and that amounts to about 230 calories. Expect them to be hard to find, except internet places like Amazon.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Kinder bars were always a greaat favorite, and so hard to come by until I found them here. Very creamy filling, just a hint of chocolate, and only 70 calories.  A truly marvelous snack, although I can't confirm if they are as healthy as the maker claims.  The shipper disclaims responsibility for condition when shipped in the summer, but they arrived beautifully packed, in excellent shape, to Georgia in August. Just one more reason for me to love Amazon.

It is easy when everything is going well.  I read once it is how we deal with problems that makes the difference.  I was very impressed with the company and how they treated me like a person.

review/summary: Convient but gross and overpriced.
review/text: I was just saying how I wish there were microwaveable toddler meals, Like the gerber ones, when I found this meal.  I was so excited to have something quick, easy, and relatively healthy on hand, but my child won't eat it.  I had a taste and I can see why, it's like chef boyarde, or whatever it's called, but even more disgusting.  Save your money, make your own ravioli and freeze it,

review/summary: The Best Juice
review/text: This is by far, the best juice I've ever had! Tasted it for the first time on a recent trip to Hawaii and it tastes like...I can't even discribe how delicious it tastes. My 10 year old son LOVES it. It's all he drank the entire time we were there! We brought a 6 pack home from our vacation but alas, now it's gone and he has asked his Grandmother, who is currently visiting Hawaii, to bring some back with her. It is how all juice should taste. Hawaii's best kept secret!!

review/summary: Most Delicious drink I've tasted
review/text: I got these drinks as well as some other Hawaiian Sun assortment from my aunt who got them straight from Hawaii and fell in love. these juices are my favorite type of juice. They're addicting good and with ice they make the ultimate smoothie and I'm sure with or without ice it'd be a great cocktail mixer. Try all the Hawaiian Sun drinks before you choose your favorite. This happens to be mine

review/summary: Childhood favorite
review/text: I grew up with these drinks even though I live on the East coast of the US. I used to go to Hawaii in the summers and my family stopped at local stores to buy tropical drinks. Hawaiian Sun has always been one of my favorite drinks and Lilikoi Passion is especially delicious! I am so happy it's offered on Amazon for those of us who live far away.  Any Hawaiian Sun product is worth trying but this and the Pass-O-Guava are truly the best drinks on the planet.

review/text: Watch out for the "new and improved taste" inscription on the package! I really liked Eclipse Spearmint gum, until they came up a couple of months ago with a "new improved taste" which is incredibly bad compared to the "old" one. I returned mine for a full refund. Funny thing is, the barcode on the package remained the same although now the gum tastes like ****, or, to put it mildly, like a completely new product. What were they thinking?!

review/summary: Best Sinus Medicine Around
review/text: Once when driving on I 95 north, near New York City, I got a very bad sinus headache, it seemed to be caused by the Air Pollution. After the City was behind us I popped a couple Eclipse Peppermint gums in my mouth and began chewing. Within minutes my headache was gone. I prefer the Spearmint flavor and use it many times a week to clear up my sinuses. The car cup gum is cheaper and has less of the minty power, but it still works for me. If I am very congested I use the blister pack version because it has a much stronger taste and sinus clearing effect. Eclipse Gum and a Neti Pot should be considered "must have" medicine for anyone with allergies.

Easy (for me) to keep down after chemo treatments.<br /><br />Especially helpful at night when I have to take medication. They really are easily digestible. And even though they are just plain cookies, they are pretty tasty too.

review/summary: Surprisingly Yummy!
review/text: I first saw these pickle pops on an episode of Unwrapped months ago.  Curiousity finally got the better of me and I ordered these through Amazon.com.  They arrived today in the mail and after about 4 hours in the freezer, I finally tried one.  At first taste it was wierd!  I'm used to a sweet fruity pop, so the salty pickle flavor made me smile and pucker just for a moment.  After a while, the real pickle flavor (the juice is really squeezed from pickles) won me over and the coolness of the ice was quite refreshing.  I even enjoyed the little bits of pickle found in the ice.  Later I'm going to try the Pickle Pops /Jalapeno (two complementary pops were added to my order) and see what that's like.  I'll definitly be purchasing more of Bob's Pickle Pops as the warm summer approaches.

review/summary: A fine new option for a low calorie sweetner
review/text: PROS:<br />Very nearly like sugar<br />Works great in cold beverages<br />Okay for hot beverages (see cons below)<br />No 'cooling effect'<br />Worked reasonably in a baking application<br />No synthesized, chemical ingredients<br /><br />CONS:<br />Contains trace amounts of sugar and molasses<br />"Natural" but not necessarily non-GMO<br />Not exactly zero calories (greater than two servings likely greater than 5 calories)<br />Very slightly bitter aftertaste in hot beverages<br />Slight honey-like overtones added to the sweetness<br />The 'natural' moniker is relative: it contains some refined sugar and is not necessarily from non-GMO sources<br /><br />NOTE: Please realize that when reviewing any food item, including sweeteners, I can only give my opinion.  Everyone's taste buds are different and everyone's perception of what tastes good in a sweetener is different.  I have done my best to describe this product, but in the end you will have to taste it yourself and see what you think.<br /><br />FULL REVIEW:<br />Nectresse is the latest no calorie sweetener from McNeil Nutritionals.  It is an admixture of Erythritol, sucrose, monk fruit (luo han guo) extract, and molasses.  The combination adds another low calorie sweetener to the mix and generally successful, depending on the application.<br /><br />WHAT'S IN THE PACKAGE:<br />Nectresse is supplied in small nearly 1/2 teaspoon, 2.4 g packets (for comparison there are 4.2 g of sugar per teaspoon). That said, 1/2 teaspoon of Nectress supplies the same sweetness as two teaspoons of sugar.  The packets are thicker foil packets, not the paper packets such as sugar an other sweetners are often packaged in.  This is likely due to the need to protect the Nectress from moisture in the environment, as it is likely more hygroscopic (moisture absorbing) than other sweeteners. The Nectress itself is slightly yellow in color but it has the same texture as sucrose, mimicking a very light, blonde sugar.  It mixes easily in hot or cold beverages and handles very similarly to sugar for these kinds of applications.<br /><br />RAW TASTE:<br />When tasted directly out of the packet, the Nectresse is almost as cleanly sweet as table sugar, but it has some slightly honey overtones.  Overall, this is a very pleasant sweetness.  There is no bitter after taste when tasted cold: if you try the directly out of the package taste test with most Stevia brands, the result is a shocking bitter after taste.  Plain erythritol has a cleaner, sucrose sweetness but is plagued with a very pronounced and to some disturbing cool after sensation (kind of like you get with mint or menthol, without the mint or menthol taste).<br /><br />On the upside, the sweetness factor is really quite good, depending on the application the taste is nearly as good as sugar.  When sweetening cold beverages (ice tea, lemonade) the Nectresse really shined.  The sweetness level was robust and it was hard to distinguish from sugar.  The honey-like overtones may not jibe with every application, but these were at least pleasant overtones as compared to other non-sugar sweeteners.<br /><br />Sadly, when used in hot beverages, such as coffee, there is a slightly perceptible, bitter aftertaste.  This is similar to the aftertaste you might get from Stevia, but not nearly as pronounced.  Unlike Stevia, the taste is simply bitter--there are no licorice after tones.  The more sweetener used, the more the bitterness. If you like your coffee lightly sweet, you may not notice it.  If you like your coffee on the more intensely sweeter side, it is noticeable.  That said, the bitter taste is less pronounced in hot tea, possibly secondary to the acidity.<br /><br />Please note, that the bulk of the sweetness here is likely from the monk fruit extract.  Monk fruit is about 150 times as sweet as sugar, so you would only need very tiny amounts of monk fruit extract for sweetness.  The erythritol, sugar, and molasses are added to add bulk, texture, and consistency to the product, so that it more closely resembles and behaves like table sugar.  They may also compliment or balance the taste of the product, but can't account for the level of sweetness.<br /><br />(There is only 1/2 teaspoon of product per package: erythritol is only 70% as sweet as sugar--it would take more than 2 1/2 teaspoons of erythritol to equal the sweetness of 2 teaspoons of sugar. And quite obviously, even 1/2 teaspoon of sucrose couldn't get you the equivalent of 2 teaspoons of itself.  Molasses is not as sweet as sugar and has a distinctive taste, so there's not enough molasses in the mix to account for the sweetness. )<br /><br />BAKING:<br />On the FAQ section on Nectresse's website, it was mentioned that you could bake with Nectresse.  Ever interested in experimentation, I decided to give it a try.  I used a simple sugar cookie recipe and baked three kinds of cookies sweetened with: 1) sugar; 2) Nectresse; and 3) pure erythritol. I commandeered my 9 and 12 year-old kids for the bake off.<br /><br />Please note: I do realize that different sweeteners have different properties.  To keep things easy, however, I simply replaced the sugar in the recipe with either Nectresse or erythritol. I do realize that the different products have different sweetness levels and different chemical properties and are not so easily interchangeable, so you should take the results of the little experiment with a grain of salt (real salt).  Even so the results were enlightening.<br /><br />After a family taste test, the results were as follows (drum roll please):  Sugar came in first, followed by Nectresse, followed by erythritol.<br /><br />1) Sugar had the best consistency and the best sugar cookie taste.  Cosmetically, the sugar cookies also spread more evenly and looked better than the other cookies.<br />2) Nectresse had excellent sweetness in this application.  You might have expected cookies that were far too sweet, given that volume for volume Nectresse should be about 4 times as sweet as sugar.  Even so, the sweetness after baking was comparable and quite good. In the cookie, at least, there was no evidence of the bitter after taste and in spite of the Nectresse containing some erythritol filler, there was no 'cooling effect' on the tongue.  The cookies failed on the level of texture.  The weren't as crisp as the real sugar cookies.  Still, you could imagine if the company can mix the Nectresse with the right kind of fillers for baking, it might be able to perform really well.<br />3) Erythritol cookies were more like the pure sugar cookies in texture, but, on a taste, they failed on a couple of levels.  The sweetness was pristine, but due to the fact that erythritol is only about 70% as sweet as sugar, the erythritol cookies didn't quite reach the level of sweetness needed in a sugar cookie.  I am still glad that I didn't weight out 1/3 more of the erythritol to get the comparable amount of sweetening, however, because the 'cooling effect' was out of control.  (Erythritol has a peculiar cooling effect on the mouth--kind of like the cooling effect you get by eating mint or menthol, but without the mint or menthol flavor.)  Even at the lower level of sweetness, the cookies had an unacceptable level of cooling that was a bit of a turn off for the family.  (Had they been mint flavored sugar cookies this might have been okay, but with the plain flavor, the kids and I felt the cooling effect was overwhelming.)<br /><br />WHAT IS IN NECTRESSE:<br />The most touted ingredient of the combination is monk fruit.  Monk fruit is really not new to the sweetener scene.  In the past, the sweetener was mostly marketed as luo han guo and has been used in the far east, mostly to sweeten cold beverages and often in combination with other sweeteners (natural and artificial).  The raw fruit extract is usually refined, allowing the removal of interfering flavors. It has been marketed in the past as a sugar substitute, the most well known brand of which is Lakanto (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079OL6T4">Lakanto, All Natural Sweetener, 800 grams</a>).  I have always been interested in tasting Lakanto, but the price tag is prohibitive.<br /><br />Although monk fruit is the main ingredient, Nectresse also has other ingredients.  Erythritol, sugar (sucrose), and molasses are added to balance out the flavor, texture, and consistency.<br /><br />IS IT NATURAL?<br />McNeil is marketing Nectresse as a natural sweetener, in contrast to Splenda (sucralose), McNeil's flagship artificial sweetener.  Nectresse may be natural, but there may be a few caveats here. The fact that McNeil Nutritionals is a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, a big pharma company not known for a 'crunchy granola' outlook might give one some pause.<br /><br />On the downside, there is no indication that the sweetener is derived from non-GMO sources.  The major ingredient, Erythritol, is often refined from corn.  Sugar and molasses are well known, but are also the products that this sweetener was designed to replace (and that most users want to avoid).  In all fairness, the fact that Nectresse has nearly 0 calories per serving  tells you that sugar and molasses content is very low and that they were probably added to subtly balance the taste and/or add consistency to the product.  This is not all that different from adding dextrose (glucose) and maltodextran to Splenda brand products.  There is less than a gram of these products in Splenda.  These products are added to Splenda as a filler for the sucralose and to balance taste and consistency.<br /><br />That said, Nectresse is not exactly a 'zero' calorie option, but a very minimal calorie option.  The FDA allows for products to advertise as 'zero' calories if they have less than 5 calories per serving.  My guess is that after you get beyond two packets, you exceed the 5 calories per serving.  Still not too bad, as the sweetness of two packets of Nectresse is the equivalent of 4 teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />Although Nectresse may be derived from natural sources, all the natural source may be refined to a point that is not acceptable to all customers.<br /><br />COMPARED TO OTHER LOW CALORIE SWEETENERS:<br />I think that Nectresse compares fairly with other low calorie sweeteners.  Obviously, the choice of sweeteners that you use is mostly dependent on your personal taste.<br /><br />I can only speak for my own taste buds, but Nectresse scores very high for me.  It is very nearly up there with xylitol and erythritol, in terms of a pure sucrose taste.  When it comes to tasting like sucrose, I'd have to give xylitol a bit of an edge here, but xylitol fails at higher amounts of intake due to GI side effects (e.g. diarrhea).  Erythritol is also more purely sweet than Nectresse and generally does not come with GI side effects, but is dogged by that overwhelming cooling effect that can occur at sweetening concentrations.  Still, I'd rather use xylitol or erythritol in my hot coffee than Nectresse, as Nectresse has that bitter taste with hot coffee.  In cold beverages, however, Nectresse wins hands down.  There are a lot of stevia fans out there and I wish them well, but even brands with lesser bitter aftertastes still have a bitter edge that kills it for me and the sweetness of stevia seems to range from a cotton candy like taste to licorice overtones; sweet but not sugar-like.  Sadly, stevia just doesn't do it for me.<br /><br />Compared to the artificial sweeteners, the best of the crowd for sweetening my morning coffee would be Equal.  I think that Nectresse compares favorably to this and I would use Nectresse rather than Equal if I had the choice. (Equal, for me, has a fairly good sweetness, but it is not quite comparable to sugar.)  Nectresse beats Splenda (sucralose) hands down, for me, as I prefer the very slight bitterness to that wacky, artificial aftertaste that I get with Splenda.  Ditto for saccharine, which just doesn't do it for me.  Saccharine never tasted quite like sugar to me and has a bitter aftertaste that overwhelms.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />All in all, Nectresse is a more than respectable alternative, low calorie sweetener. For my palate, it is comparable to most other natural sugar substitutes for taste and beats the artificial sweeteners hands down. Sadly, though,none of the alternatives tastes or handles perfectly like table sugar.  But after trying Nectresse out, it is definitely something that I will use in the future.

review/summary: Unique sweetness makes Nectresse a winner
review/text: "Hello, my name is David, and I'm a sugar addict." "Hello, David." True, I love my sweets, but my sweets do not love me. Hence, I tend to rely on sugar substitues (perhaps a little too much) to stave off those sugar cravings. My go-to has always been stevia, in one form or another, whether liquid extract, powder, crystalized (Truvia), or organic ground, as I think stevia is an excellent sweetener. But, always willing to try something new, I was happy to indulge in Nectresse, a new natural sweetner from the makers of Splenda.<br /><br />The primary source of sweetener in Nectresse is monk fruit (aka luo han guo), which I have eaten as an additive in other foods, and have always found to be tasty. This was my first opportunity trying it as an actual sugar substitute, so I tried to utilize it in several different applications.<br /><br />First, on its own, Nectresse is great. I initially thought there was a slightly off aftertaste, but I realized it was hints of the monk fruit itself, and the flavor everntually grew on me. I then sprinkled Nectresse on various kinds of fruits, from watermelon and peaches to strawberries and cantaloupe, and it fared well on all of them, adding just the right touch of sweetness without overpowering the natural flavors of the fruits.<br /><br />I also added Nectresse to cold almond milk, as well as hot tea, and was very pleasantly surprised to see how well the granuals disolved in liquid, which tends to be problematic with stevia (mostly so with Truvia). And not a lot of Nectresse was necessary to sweeten the drinks (maybe half a packet), so a little goes a long way.<br /><br />I did not have the opportunity to bake with Nectresse, so I cannot comment on how well it does in baked goods, but based on my initial observations, I think it's likely to perform well.<br /><br />Now, I would exercise some caution here, as there is sugar in Nectresse -- though, less than 1g (which, in a 2.4g serving, could still be significant). The other ingredients are Erythritol and Molasses. So, if you are on a complete no sugar diet, you'd likely have to skip this sweetener. Still, there are 0 calories overall, with the Erythritol providing 2g of carbohydrates.<br /><br />Overall, I think Nectresse is a far better option than Splenda and Aspartame (especially considering their sketchy health and safety issues), but in my opinion, not quite as good as stevia. But, taste is highly subjective, so I think opinions are likely to be quite divided here. I will definitely continue to use Nectresse, as it's a great form of monk fruit extract, but it won't be the first product I reach for when attempting to quell my sweet tooth.

review/summary: Your Mileage May Vary...
review/text: I drink a lot of herbal iced teas (which I brew myself).  I used to use sugar to sweeten my tea, but I later switched to liquid stevia.  It really took me a long time to find my stevia too, because I tried out a lot of other sugar alternatives (such as Splenda and Sweet-n-Low) and I couldn't stand the taste of any of them.  The first stevia I ever tried had a nasty taste to it, but I've heard that liquid stevia taste can differ depending on the brand, so I kept looking.  I really like my current brand of liquid stevia (Nunaturals) because it's the only stevia I've ever been able to find that doesn't have a nasty taste.  I'm always eager to try out a new sugar replacement product, though, since my stevia is pretty pricey.<br /><br />So, I eagerly tried out the new Nectresse stuff since I'd read so many nice descriptions of how lovely and natural and tasty it is.  Well, each person's taste buds are different, but the Nectresse just doesn't taste good to me.  I tried it in some grits, and in several cups of tea.  It's got a weird unpleasant flavor to it (sort of similar to the weird chemical taste of Sweet N' Low).  Of course, due to differing tastes, your mileage may vary.  Another weird problem I have with the Nectresse is that according to the box, it says that "a packet of nectresse equals two teaspoons of sugar" which seems to imply that the nectresse is sweeter than regular sugar.  Strangely though, I found that it was the opposite.  I felt that the nectresse was NOT as sweet and I had to add more packets of it.  That's rather unfortunate.  I will say one thing in it's favor, though; I does melt in water like it says it does.<br /><br />Well, I can't say that I enjoyed this product or would want to buy more of it, just due to taste alone.  I also can't really speak on it's price since I got it through Vine and it's not available yet (as of this writing) on Amazon to do price comparisons.  So, I certainly wouldn't recommend it based on my own experience, but since everyone's different, if you are searching for a non-sugar sweetener, you might want to buy a small package of Nectresse to try out for yourself.  Who knows, you might like it better than I did.

review/summary: A very unpleasant and not at all sweet flavor for me
review/text: It's probably just me... about six months ago, I stopped using no-calorie sweeteners at all, and I've been using mostly honey and agave syrup since then.  Maybe I'm not used to other sweeteners anymore.  My first impression of this was that it had a terrible flavor, and it wasn't very sweet at all.<br /><br />I tried it first in a cup of tea--instead of my usual scant teaspoon of honey, I tried half a packet of Nectresse.  The flavor was bad enough that I dumped the tea.  I waited a day before trying it in some plain yogurt.  I added a little bit to a small amount of yogurt, and again, threw it away after the first taste.<br /><br />Just to compare, I tried a little Splenda in some fresh plain yogurt, and it tasted fine, though just sweet, without the depth of flavor of honey.<br /><br />Looking at other reviews, it seems as though some people love it and some find it unpleasant.  I'd suggest trying a small amount before stocking up on this sweetener.

review/summary: has an odd taste; I prefer Splenda
review/text: It's tough to review a food product since we all have different taste preferences.  So, I focused on how this compares to Splenda since it is made by the same company. I use Splenda exclusively, as a way to control caloric intake.  I like the "taste", and find it comparably sweet to sugar without an aftertaste (such as Equal and Sweet N Low have for me). Most importantly, I use Splenda because it has no aspartame, which I am allergic to.<br /><br />Nectresse also has no aspartame, but unfortunately, I found it to have an odd and very noticeable taste.  I'm not sure if this is the monk fruit, or the molasses, but it is distinct.  It was unpleasant and downright wrong in iced tea (I dumped a glass made with it), so I decided to try it in plain Greek yogurt. I normally add 2 Splenda packets and a scoop of sugar free jelly to my yogurt; I did the same with the Nectresse.  The odd flavor was still noticeable, though not unpleasant with the jelly - just different.  However, I also found that it wasn't as sweet.  I think another reviewer may be right - this is more "fruit" sweet, with a hint of tartness, than "sugar" sweet.  The Nectresse comes in thicker, foil-lined packets like the Splenda Essentials do. I find these inconvenient.  You can't easily shake the product to the bottom of the bag to open, and it's not as easily opened either.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't bad, per se, and could be an alternative for those who do not like Splenda but need to avoid aspartame.  I would hazard a guess that those who prefer Splenda will not like this.  I will finish the sample package I was sent, as the taste isn't as off-putting in fruit based items like herbal tea or yogurt.  But, I wouldn't buy this, regardless of the price.

review/summary: A serious contender in the sweetener marketplace
review/text: I'm pleased to see another one of the big companies jumping into the natural sweetener ring with this offering.  Meant, I'm certain, as direct competition for Truvia, this is a really nice product.  Monk fruit is the primary sweetening force in these little packets as opposed to stevia in Truvia.  Monk fruit (also known as luo han guo in China where it originates) and stevia have a lot of molecular properties in common.  They are kissing cousins in the natural sweetener world, with monk fruit offering a slightly more positively robust flavor profile with tasters offering descriptors like:  honey, fruity, molasses, brown sugar.<br /><br />The best products containing stevia, by comparison, have a stronger more streamlined flavor that just screams:  sweet! for the most part, yet there is high variability between stevia strains which you will quickly learn if you start tasting all the various products in the marketplace.  The cleanest stevia flavor is to be found in a single ingredient, pure stevia product made by KAL.  Others tend to have some off flavors like licorice or bitter notes and lingering unpleasant aftertastes.  Yet, for me, it's been a long time since I've partaken in any of those, having found the KAL product years ago, I began mixing my own blend with Erythritol, Xylitol, KAL's stevia and pure glucose to round out the flavor profile.  I occasionally use truvia or splenda when away from home.<br /><br />Extracts like stevia and monk fruit offer some interesting problems for the manufacturers.  The sweetness factor is incredibly high--miniscule amounts approximate a couple of teaspoons of sugar--something like 1/128 of a teaspoon or the like.  How do they deliver that in a packet?  Well, they have to mix it up with something else that adds bulk, of course.  A sugar alcohol is the obvious choice because it tastes so much like sugar yet delivers very few to zero practical calories.  The manufacturers lean toward erythritol because it results in zero net calories in such small amounts.  They might be better served by combining it with xylitol and/or something else like pure glucose or fructose because anyone with sensitive, um, digestive functions are going to find that using a lot of this product is going to send them running for the bathroom--though they probably won't make the connection.  The sugar alcohols (as those who have partaken of diabetic candies quickly learn) can wreak havoc with the gut.<br /><br />That said, this product contains 2 grams of erythritol per packet, while Truvia contains 3 grams per packet.  That's a significant difference if you are a heavy coffee drinker.  And, in addition, Nectresse is a far superior product taste-wise.<br /><br />Artificial sweeteners tend to hit one 'note' of sweetness and clang that single note with gusto which tends to fall flat.  The problem is real sugar is a clamor of notes--thousands of little sweet notes of varying degrees and ranges that culminate in one mental rapport--satisfying sweetness.  Monk fruit naturally hits more of those notes and the additional ingredients the manufacturer has added tinkle a few more in the background which is why this is really a superior product.  I have always found that a more satisfying approach is to combine many sweeteners in smaller amounts, trying to hit as many notes as possible.  I can't go back to sugar--my body just doesn't process it properly and I'm working hard to avoid the genetic tendency toward diabetes that runs in my family by eating a low glycemic index diet.<br /><br />So, all that said,  I was truly impressed with this product and its clean, simple, sweet flavor.  If I could only use one commercial product, this one would be it.

review/summary: Very Different
review/text: In the past 6 months I've had fun sampling the many new varieties of low-calorie and/or artifical sweeteners that have come to market.  I tried this Nectresse about a month ago but couldn't decide if I liked it or not, so this morning I did a side-by-side comparison of Splenda Nectresse with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00511MJO8">Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia, 75-Count (Pack of 3)</a>.  First I simply dipped a damp pinkie into each packet and tried them straight-up. BIG difference in taste.  The stevia shocks your tongue with how sweet it is.  The Nectresse on the other hand doesn't convey much sweetness at all and also has a unique taste that is hard to describe.  Next test...half a packet of each in a hot, regular coffee with half-and-half creamer.  Side-by-side tasting yielded a clear winner for me:  the stevia would be my first choice every time in a cup of coffee.  The Nectress adds a funky little taste that I don't enjoy in coffee.  Now, it's possible that the Nectresse would be fine to sweeeten a cold glass of a fruity iced tea. I tried it in plain iced tea and still wasn't crazy about it because that funky little taste still was detectable.  In general I don't want my sweeteners to have any taste of their own - other than just plain old SWEET - so, while it was okay, I probably wouldn't buy Nectresse again.

I made some iced coffees for friends with it and they said they couldn't tell it had an alternative sweetener. I say alternative, because it isn't exactly artificial like some are. Anyone who uses alternative sweeteners knows that there is some sort of after taste to all of them, so it really depends on your taste preferences. This one really scored high for me and I'd definitely buy it again.

review/summary: Has what you want, doesn't have what you don't
review/text: As a near-daily coffee drinker, I've had ample opportunity to try just about every sweetener on the market. Thanks to Amazon Vine, my "go-to" sweetener" has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OQ257M">Splenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener with B Vitamins, Net Wt 2.8-Ounces (Pack of 4)</a>, and although I don't particularly have a natural or organic bent, I'm okay with using all natural products that are effective and don't cost more than the competitors. It seems Nectresse fits in that niche.<br /><br />This is an all natural sweetener derived from monk fruit (whatever that is), it has a texture and flavor pretty close to a "light" sugar, much like another all natural sweetener, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V8Y892">Truvia Natural Sweetener, 1000-Count Packages</a>. I found the flavor adequate and the sweetening amount pretty much in line with other artificial and natural non-sugar sweeteners. There aren't any vitamins or extras in this product, which is fine if you just need to sweeten something and nothing more. The individual packs are single serving size and convenient as always. The orange color is eye opening and easy to find in my cluttered tea-bag, coffee filter, other-sweetener-laden morning drink drawer. That is to say, this is a product that does what it should in an all natural fashion at what looks like a reasonable price. It's maybe not outstanding, but I just want my coffee a little sweet, and Nectresse delivers. That rates at least four stars in my cup, all morning long.

review/text: Nectresse is really tasty. Out of all the sweeteners I've sampled, it's the one closest in texture and flavor to real sugar. I didn't notice any bad aftertaste and unlike saccharine, it is a full-bodied sugar clone.<br /><br />However, my one complaint is that the box and company's web site doesn't give enough information about what Nectresse really is. I know it's made from natural monk fruit, but according to the product site, the monk fruit extract is then blended with other natural sweeteners to create NECTRESSE(tm) Sweetener. So obviously, there are other ingredients not listed. And I want to know what those are. I want to know if those other natural sweeteners have the same glycemic effect as sugar. Calories are not the only consideration.<br /><br />I think Nectresse tastes better than Stevia, but until I know what's in the orange packets, I'm not sure about trying more.

I thought of all things, it would go well with a bowl of oatmeal, not so! It just tasted kind of strange.<br /><br />This sweetener is not really for diabetics. It has both sugar and molasses in it, although low enough to slip under the amount to trigger sugar carbs on the label.<br /><br />To my taste, this is super sweet stuff, and I do not care for this particular combination of sweeteners. This is my subjective opinion, and someone else's could be entirely different.

review/summary: After taste, not sweet enough
review/text: I am disappointed with this product. I used it in my coffee on several different days but I can't force myself to like it. It is not very sweet at first taste. Then the sweetness starts coming as almost an after taste. Then there's a strange after taste that follows the sweetness. I'm trying hard to like this but just can't.

review/summary: Sweet and Fruity
review/text: I like this for a zero calorie sweetener. It is sweet and has a fruity taste that I think suits drinks like ice tea better than coffee, although I have used it in my coffee and it tastes very decent. The texture is like granulated raw sugar, and I like it and think it could even be sprinkled on berries or other fruit if it needed sweetener.  I have not researched the health effects of this product and don't know how it compares to Equal and Splenda, which I personally shy away from because I worry about whether they are good for you. If this is healthier, then it is definitely worth switching and is very good in my opinion for a zero calorie sweetener. Personally, I like the taste as much or better than Stevia.

review/summary: NOT as sweet as SPLENDA, but still good.
review/text: I am a long-time Splenda user.  I use both Splenda and Jay Robb Stevia combined to sweeten my ice tea.  (I drink about a 1/2 gallon a day.)  So, I substituted the Splenda with the Nectresse (and still used the same amount of Stevia).  My tea was noticably less sweet, but I still drank the whole gallon of tea.  The next gallon of tea, I made with 1/4 Splenda, 1/4 Nectresse and 1/2 Stevia and my iced tea tasted perfect.  Nectresse is definitely not as sweet as Splenda (which may be good for some people).  Also, the texture of Nectresse is closer to sugar (versus the powdery texture of Splenda), which I liked.  I think for now I am going to stick with Splenda for my ice tea.  But I do plan to try Nectresse in some of my recipes that require sugar since I don't really like Splenda in some of my recipes that require sugar.  I will update my review after trying it in food.

review/summary: Great taste and familiar texture
review/text: I am no great fan of artificial sweeteners in general.  Still holding on to the belief that nothing tops sugar for taste and I use so little I do not worry a lot about the number of calories.  As for health affects of sugar, I am hesitant to find fault with it over what we are hearing now concerning some of the artificial sweeteners. However, this appears to be a good alternative to nutrasweet and is quite good.  The familiar crystal form seems to give it the texture of sugar as well.  Unlike many sweeteners, there is no chemical aftertaste.  All in all, a this appears to be a great product if you are attempting to avoid sugar.  Only time will tell if it falls to the same health concerns of others as it becomes more popular.

review/summary: Good, but I prefer Splenda; concerns about tooth decay
review/text: Nectresse is great for those who will not use artificial sweeteners but still want to indulge in sweet things. It is all natural, made from monk fruit, but has zero calories. It is made by the same company that makes Splenda. One packet of Nectresse is equivalent to two teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />I am a big user of Splenda so that is what I will compare it to. How does it taste? To me it is slightly less sweet than Splenda. It lacks that sharp, sweet taste, but still imparts a nice sweet flavor. The texture? It is much more grainy than Splenda -- more like regular sugar, which may or may not be a plus for you. I prefer the finer powdery texture of Splenda as it blends more easily when sprinkled over food and used in liquids.<br /><br />So why did I knock it down a star? Because there was no notation anywhere on the box or on their website about Nectresse and tooth decay. The fact is artificial sweeteners will not promote tooth decay. But since Nectresse is all natural, it could promote tooth decay just like regular sugar. I searched their website but could not find any information on this, but I'm pretty sure this is the case. So, from this perspective, I feel the artificial sweeteners like Splenda may be better for oral health.<br /><br />Because of all these reasons, I'm sticking to Splenda. But if you are one of those people who do not like using artificial sweeteners, then Nectresse is the perfect alternative.

review/summary: First there were pink packets, then blue, then yellow. NOW we have ORANGE! It's all subjective
review/text: I received a sample packet of this new sweetener from Amazon as part of their Vine Reviewer program.<br /><br />I'll say up front that my "regular" sweetener is Sweet `n Low and I guess I'm accustomed to it. I use about 2/3 of a "pink packet" in an 10 oz cup of coffee or 12 oz glass of iced tea and it's just the right sweetness. I've tried both Splenda (the company that makes Nectresse) and Equal and I find that a full "yellow" or "blue" packet is not sweet enough. So this was a good chance to try something new.<br /><br />Honestly, while it didn't have an "after taste" it didn't blow me away. There are other things to consider when choosing a "calorie-free" sweetener that I'd like to point out:<br /><br />1- These zero calorie sweeteners will help those on a diet but only so much. A teaspoon of sugar contains only 15 calories. So we are talking about saving 30 calories here; that's not much.<br /><br />2- There are four  ingredients to Nectress and one of them is "sugar".  Here's the description: Ingredients Erythritol, Sugar, Monk Fruit Extract, Molasses. But still no "calories". The Monk Fruit is the difference. Note also that the product is white so the sugar is obviously "refined".<br /><br />3- If I read the package correctly it is not made for baking. So consider that. It comes only in packets that are about twice as thick as a normal SUGAR packet. Someone did point out - see their comment - that the website says it can be used in baking.)<br /><br />And then there is the issue of cost. You will note that - at least as of today (July 4th) the product is "not yet available" and there is no price. I think people consider their sweeteners also based on cost. So I can't pass judgment on the value or cost/benefit of Nectresse until pricing is available.<br /><br />I'll finish using the 40-pack samples that Amazon sent to Vine reviewers as it still works. But I'll withhold final judgement until the product becomes widely available.<br /><br />And, like any food product, remember that TASTE is SUBJECTIVE.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"

review/summary: surprisingly neutral flavor with no aftertaste, but perhaps less sweet than some sugar substitutes
review/text: As some background, I should disclose that I regularly use Splenda -- most frequently in plain greek yogurt, either mixed in with some fruit or some other flavoring such as vanilla beans.  In the past I have regularly used Nutrasweet.  I have tried Stevia but I found that I did not like its aftertaste.  I never warmed to saccharine because of its bad aftertaste, too.  I have used Splenda blends in baking with good results as well, though I seldom bake any sweets any more due to dietary reasons.<br /><br />What I liked about Nectresse was that it didn't seem to add any flavor to my yogurt beyond sweetness.  I detected no aftertaste at all, and the sweetness itself was fairly mild.  By comparison, the same amount of Splenda (one packet per 8 ounces of yogurt) has a higher level of sweetness.<br /><br />Just to confirm my perceptions, I decided to taste both Nectresse and Splenda by themselves.  In this taste test, I again found Nectresse to have a slightly lower level of sweetness.  Nectresse looks a bit more like sugar -- small grains versus fine white powder.  Beyond the different appearance and slightly different intensity level, the products were nearly identical in that they both taste clean with a hint of an aftertaste that is apparent when consumed alone but is masked when used as they normally would be -- mixed with other ingredients.<br /><br />I'll leave it to others to debate how natural this product is.  In addition to the hyped monk fruit extract, it also contains erythritol, sugar, and molasses.  In fact, erythritol is the first ingredient listed, so I assume that means that the product, by weight, contains more of that than the other ingredients.  According to what I read online, erythritol is much less likely to cause intestinal discomfort than other sugar alcohols because it is largely absorbed in the small intestine.  I've never been bothered by any sugar alcohol in this regard, however, except on the lone unfortunate occasion when I consumed WAY too much sugar-free chocolate and had a regretful afternoon.

review/summary: Nectress not "natural" like they claim & contains refined sugar
review/text: They claim this product is all natural and made from monk fruit.  But monk fruit is not the only ingredient in Nectresse, nor is it even the primary ingredient. The first and most abundant ingredient in Nectresse is actually ERYTHRITOL, a sugar alcohol commonly derived from corn, the vast majority of which has been genetically modified (GM) in the U.S.  As some others here have attested, sugar alcohols give some people cramps or other digestive issues.<br /><br />The second ingredient in Nectresse is REFINED SUGAR, which more than likely comes from GM sugar beets.<br /><br />The third ingredient in Nectresse is monk fruit, which they claim is extracted using a natural process involving both water and heat rather than chemicals -- this is good.<br /><br />But the fourth and final ingredient in Nectresse is MOLASSES which, once again, is a sugar more than likely derived from GM sugar beets.  (Producers that use sugar from sugar cane, after all, typically indicate this on their ingredient labels!)<br /><br />So three out of the four ingredients used in Nectresse appear to be derived from bioengineered crops, and two of these ingredients are refined sugars! And since erythritol is a sugar alcohol, as well as the most abundant ingredient in Nectresse, they can legally claim under F.D.A. guidelines that it has zero calories per serving.<br /><br />But the fact that Nectresse more than likely contains ingredients derived from GM sources means that it is hardly the "natural" product that they're hyping it up to be. Sure, Nectresse contains a little bit of monk fruit which, like the stevia plant, contains compounds that are naturally very sweet, but that do not provide the body with calories in the same way as sugar. But the other ingredients found in Nectresse can hardly be considered natural.

review/text: I don't know what it is but I have never been able to handle no calorie sweeteners. I've tried them all. In some it's the aftertaste but in ALL of them I would get a horribly upset stomach within minutes of ingesting it. I saw a commercial for Nectresse and decided to give it a try. I had my first packet of it yesterday in a cup of black coffee. I added nothing else except the Nectresse. No after taste at all. Tastes just like I used regular sugar. Then I waited for the stomach upset. It never came!!! I believe the folks at Splenda have hit the nail on the head. This stuff is good. Real good! I'll be using Nectresse from now on.

review/summary: Nectresse--How sweet it is!
review/text: To me, sweet is sweet and that's what my sweet tooth demands! And, though, I didn't find Nectresse to taste EXACTLY like sugar or EXACTLY like Splenda, the alternative sweetner that I use, Nectresse DID satisfy my nagging cravings and tasted pretty darn good in things that I need to liven up like a boring dollop of cottage cheese. What is most sweet is that Nectresse is an all-natural, zero calorie sweetner; this fact alone has now made it my number one sweeter OVER Splenda, in light of all the health concerns that the chemical mix of Splenda has posed throughout the health-conscious community.<br /><br />I mean anything made of fruit, in this case, monk fruit sounds just darn right good to me. What is even better and really sweetens the brand name even more is that monk fruit is harvested from small family owned farms; this deserves an A-plus alone!<br /><br />I also like the durable packets that manufacturers have packaged Nectresse in. They are stiff enough to stand upright on my kitchen counter as opposed to the flimsy paper on the market that drops the granules everywhere.<br /><br />My only qualm, as others have stated, is that Nectresse does contain some sugar; not a good thing for those of us who are trying to eliminate the additive from our diets. In my case, however, health rules out, and Nectresse has found a permanent place on my shelf in the cupboard as an RX to sprinkle sweet in a moment's notice for that unpredictable monster of temptation!<br /><br />Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist<br />Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE

review/text: Nectresse is definitely a viable alternative to sugar and other artificial sweeteners. The only thing I didn't like was the fruity after taste, which is understandable since it's made from monk fruit. However, I fear that the fruity after taste might conflict with whatever you happen to sprinkle it on. I probably wouldn't purchase this in the future, but for those who are looking for a healthier sugar alternative, this might be worth a try.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: As my husband and I are big fans of Splenda, I thought I'd give this a try. I nearly bought the neat little jar of it, but then decided on the small box of packets. Wise choice!  It would have been an even bigger waste of money.  I tried this in iced tea tonight, and while I was game to try to finish the glass, my huband took one drink and got a horrible look on his face.  And as much as I tried to give it a go, I couldn't finish my glass.  The Nectress first hits your tongue with sweetness, then the sweetness seems to go away. But after you swallow, your entire tongue is engulfed (or attacked) in an unpleasant aftertaste. My husband desribed it as bitter, but I thought of it more as chemical.  Then it kind of burned on the way down.<br /><br />In a word: yuck. It's not as bad as Sweet-N-Low, but it's down there.

There was no unpleasant after-taste that I detected myself. And, the best observation was that my usual crowd actually made no comment about this product at all, proving that it was as effective as all the other sweeteners that we have previously used, but has the added benefit of being a more natural product.<br /><br />Hardly a ground-breaking scientific discovery. However, when it comes to an everyday item like sweeter for coffee or tea, sometimes the best comment is that the sweetness is as expected, requiring no comment whatsoever.

review/text: As someone who tried many sweeteners, I was tempted to try Necrtesse.  In a nutshell, it seems to vary sweetness from one beverage to another.  I had to put several packets in a regular cup of tea to make it sweet, but not too sweet.  I then tried using it with peppermint tea.  Usually I do not need much sugar with my peppermint tea, but for some reason it made peppermint tea turn a tad bitter.  I guess this was a case of aftertaste.  In other words, this sweetener was all over the place on a sweetness scale.  That being said, I would still prefer this sweetener over aspartame.

review/text: I have a total sweet tooth, and routinely get shocked looks when people see how much sugar I add to my tea. To the extent possible, with cold drinks, I try and use Splenda, since it dissolves quickly and evenly. However, I've never liked it for hot drinks -- that wisp of bitterness and artificial taste comes across stronger. This new sweetener solves that problem, I've used it in a variety of hot teas and found it to be uniformly superior in taste to Splenda. I'll admit that I have no idea what monk fruit is, and obviously I haven't researched the effects of using this stuff for twenty years, but I'll certainly look at making the switch for my hot drinks!

It wasn't overpowering but it was definitely there.<br /><br />In the same size peppermint tea, the fruity twinge was still noticeable but less concerning, likely because it was tea.<br /><br />I would say that even if you like your food/drink extra sugary, you might want to use maybe one or two packets of this and then finish it off with general Splenda if bypassing the fruity taste is a big concern for you.

We do not yet know the cost, but since the product comes individually packed in a special foiled container and since there is already a Splenda product, my ranking is based upon anticipating that this product will cost more than other sweetners (as many natural and low-calorie products do, which is sad but true...)<br /><br />In the past, for a regular cup of tea, I would use half a package of sweetner...so the mild flavor worked for me...If somebody really likes lots of a sugar taste, one package would probably not work for them...<br /><br />I would recommend it with my noted concerns...<br /><br />GABixlerReviews

review/summary: So far, so good!
review/text: Full disclosure: my doctor is one of the people responsible for bringing this product to market in the US. He had been telling me about monk-fruit based sweeteners for a few years prior to Nectresse being produced, so I was really excited to test out this sample.<br /><br />I've added this to berries and smoothies, so far, and all I can say is two thumbs up. No aftertaste, micro-granules dissolve quickly, and it's great to not be worrying about this being an artificial sweetener. Recently I thought I'd try cooking and baking with xylitol, let's just say there were mixed reactions to that. Xylitol, even in small amounts, can give you wicked bad gas. Nothing like that with Nectresse. I'm hopeful that they'll offer bulk quantities soon. Due to its concentrated sweetness, I imagine baking with it might present some logistical challenges, but if you've ever used stevia or any other non-bulking sweetener, then you already understand about that.

In other words, it tastes "more natural" and less chalky. And, it's still very very sweet, just like the original Splenda is.

The pink packets are just plain awful, the blue packets are a great improvement but a little on the chemical side, the yellow packets are not quite as sweet but a much better flavor and can be used easily in cooking.  Now we have the orange packets.  I am always up to try something new and glad to see a sweetener that is 100% natural after all the chemical controversy about other products.  However, my Nectresse results were mixed.  The flavor of Nectresse is definitely sweeter than Splenda (its parent company) and the Nectresse seems to pleasingly cut some of the bitterness in my super strong French roast coffee.  But the large grain size makes it less easy to shake evenly over cereal, yogurt or fruit and makes it quite difficult to dissolve.  The cold cereal test was not very successful for the same reason -- the Nectresse did not dissolve in the cold milk and was left as a super sweet residue in the bottom of the bowl.  If I don't do a lot of stirring while it is hot, it also does not dissolve well in the hot coffee.  It is unclear from the package whether it would work well and retain its sweetness in baking or cooking as Splenda (the yellow packet) does.  So I have a mixed review -- great taste but not so easy to use.

review/summary: I've tried a lot of sweeteners . .
review/text: . . . And this is one of the best I've tried.  No after taste, it's not too sweet, it looks just like sugar; it doesn't act like a powder.  I've used it in hot drinks, iced drinks, on top of fruit and cereal and it tastes good on and in everything I've tried it with.<br /><br />No calories means a lot to me - I like some things to be sweet (iced tea, for instance), but worry about ingesting too many chemicals or calories.<br /><br />I especially like the fact that there are no chemicals, just natural products.  I'll definitely be buying this in the future.

review/summary: Pretty sweet
review/text: I'm always on the lookout for ways to cut calories without sacrificing flavor, so I jumped at the chance to try Nectresse. In the past, artificial sweeteners have disappointed me with their fake flavor or icky aftertaste (especially Stevia--gross). Nectresse, so far, has struck just the right balance of natural flavor in my coffee and tea.
