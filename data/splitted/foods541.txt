review/summary: Absolutely Delicious Dried Blueberries.  I Wish They Were Packaged Differently.
review/text: The Traverse Bay Fruit Co. Dried blueberries are absolutely delicious.  They aren't as plump as I dreamed they would be but, even so, their concentrated blueberry flavor is fantastic.  I am even getting to like their dried, chewy, somewhat grainy texture which is reminiscent of seeded raisins with very tiny seeds.<br /><br />The dried blueberries in the four pound box are sweetened with sugar (not with corn syrup as the smaller packs of Traverse Bay Fruit Co. blueberries apparently are) and have a touch of sunflower oil added to them in order to keep them from clumping together.<br /><br />In a perfect world, these dried blueberries wouldn't come packaged in a giant four pound plastic bag that isn't even resealable.  When they arrived, I repackaged them into several heavy duty Ziploc bags in order to store them more easily.

review/summary: Excellent product, plump, flavorful, free of preservatives
review/text: I've been hooked on Traverse dried cranberries for a while and just decided to try their blueberries this week, thanks in part to a review and comment response by "Kyra". They arrived in 2 days as promised in excellent condition/packaging, even in this heat wave New England is having right now. While they do look a lot like raisins, upon closer look (with my glasses and a light on), they are deep purplish/blue and glossy. Soft and plump, not hard like raisins. I don't find the sweetness to be too much, although I can't recall the last time I used sugar in/on anything, including during my childhood (just don't like sweet foods). The 'sugar' is not visible as on some raisins and the berries are not overly sticky to the touch. There are a few clumps, but when picked up, they break apart without any effort.<br /><br />These are great as a snack in hand (I know: I'm munching while making blueberry breakfast bread!) to be followed by a homemade trail mix with dried cranberries, almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, flaxseeds, sesame seeds, some granola that is laying around and coconut.<br /><br />Best bargain I've found for blueberries, including fresh and then freezing or drying my own. These take the extra work out and are more than worth their price. I'll definitely purchase them again.

review/summary: Delicious!!!
review/text: These are, the MOST delicious, dried blueberries we've ever bought! They are sweetened just enough, don't stick together in a lump, are just slightly juicy, have no preservatives AND taste great refrigerated! For those who are wondering, 4# just fits in a 1-gallon zip lock bag. On the box, it says a serving size is 1/3 cup and there are 42 servings. They were just over $50 on sale. I will buy these again!

The berries have a luscious lingering trace of berry tartness which is PERFECT for the use I have in mind...... to balance the (semi) sweetness present in my chocolate chip cookies.

review/summary: The Best, Simply the Best!
review/text: I actually live in Michigan and every year head up to Traverse City for the cherry fest. It was during a cherry fest like 6-7 years ago that I was introduced to Traverse Bay dried fruits. I have never eaten another brand since. If you like dried fruit then look no further. Traverse Bay sells Dried Cherries, Dried Organic Cherries, Dried Organic Blueberries, Dried Wild Blueberries, Dried Red Raspberries, and Dried Strawberries. Just check out the companies homepage. They even offer subscription based shipping just like Amazon. They also sell a bunch of other stuff as well including antioxidant fruit based vitamins, Jams, fruit concentrates, etc..<br /><br />While dried cherries and dried cranberries are my favorites, I still really enjoy dried blueberries. I have actually tried a lot of different brands over the years and none of them have the quality, freshness and flavor that Traverse Bay has. I eat them out of the box, on cereal, in salads, and even in homemade ice cream. Dried blueberries, or any other dried fruit for that matter, is just a great snack.<br /><br />The bottom line - If your looking for high quality dried blueberries then look no further.<br /><br />5 Stars!

review/text: I love to bake and make dry snack mixes, like trail mix, so these are ideal for me.  They are on hand and I don't have to worry about using them before they spoil like fresh ones.  I also like frozen ones, but sometimes these are best if you don't want the blue color to bleed into your batter or don't need additional liquid.  Consider how much you can use prior to purchasing or split this with someone.  It too me a LONG time to go through this box.  Compared to the fresh price around here ($5.99 for a 1/4 pint), this is definitely a good deal.

review/summary: high quality dried fruit
review/text: this is the second year that we have purchased the dried blueberries as well as the dried cherries.  we split each variety for our parents for Christmas stocking stuffers.  of course, we keep a smidgen for ourselves.  the fruit is excellent and without preservatives; the flavor is outstanding and maintains quality in sealed containers in the frig.  we are considering splurging on ourselves and making a purchase just for us.  our folks rave over the berries and have asked to keep this as a yearly tradition if not more frequent.  as in product description, the dried fruit can be used in just about anything and is a real treat just as is.  ordering through amazon, with free shipping and a discount price, sweetens the deal even more.  we highly recommend.

review/summary: No Blues Over These Berries
review/text: I can't get blueberries in Xiamen, China, where I've lived since the late 80s (but when I came I couldn't even get good toilet paper, so things have improved!).  So we ordered this 4 pound box of Traverse Bay Blueberries, though I was disappointed they felt the need to add sugar and oil to them (I usually use no sugar on anything).  But...these berries are great!<br /><br />I put them in a glass of water overnight in the fridge, and the next morning they are plump and juicy, and ready to eat straight, or to put in my homemade muesli or blueberry pancakes.  I even pour a bit of the tasty blue liquid left over onto my pancakes or waffles.<br /><br />This is the best price on dried blueberries that I've found, and I'm very happy with them.  And 4 pounds goes a long ways-especially if you hydrate them (eating them dry seems such a waste, because you don't quite get the flavor; if I want to eat dried ones, I might as well save money and eat some good cheap raisins).<br /><br />It would be nice if they could just sell them without the oil and sugar, but if I'd not read the ingredients on Amazon, I'd have never known from the taste that they weren't just unadulterated blueberries.

review/summary: A delightful cheese with rich walnut flavor.
review/text: This Gouda did not disappoint. The many pieces of walnut sprinkled throughout the cheese were the perfect compliment to the buttery, tangy, and nutty gouda, already a rich cheese. The cheese came with a yellow paraffin wax rind which came off easily and the cheese sliced easily. The taste was everything I expected with a nice buttery yet very tangy gouda flavor and the dense crunch of the walnuts with just enough walnut flavor for a great overall experience. I served this mostly on a cheese plate to compliment some cheddars, with tart apples, and grapes, but it was also excellent melted on a chicken panini sandwich and as an hors d'oeuvre melted in a phyllo shell with bacon and leeks. iGourmet ships it re-packaged and re-labeled in a vacuum-sealed thick plastic and ships in an insulated bag with gel packs so the cheese arrives in perfect condition. I was very pleased with this purchase and would definitely buy this again.

review/summary: Aegean canned Stuffed Grape Leaves
review/text: Compared to fresh stuffed grape leaves I've had at Costco, these have more oil (sunflower) and thus more fat and aren't quite as good.  These don't have tomato in them and the rice is more mushy.  They're really packed tight in the can, so it is a bit difficult to get them out intact.  Also, I just bit into a small piece of red onion skin which I was unable to chew.  They're not a bad deal though for six cans and I don't regret buying them.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by the fresher ones I've had.

Exact same complaint - the grape leaves are old and tough and I couldn't chew it. I had to spit it out. I will say the flavor was good on the whole but when you can't chew it that's a big "no no"!

review/text: I grew up on homemade grapeleaves and have been looking for an easy way to get some.  These grapeleaves taste better than what I can order in some restaurants.  The flavors are blended together well.  I suggest rinsing the grapeleaves after you open the can, since they are a bit oily, and then keeping them in the fridge.  They taste better chilled and are firmer.  You get about 18 leaves in the can, 6 cans per pack.  This is a great deal for people who want grapeleaves in a hurry.  Highly recommended!

Clearly it's more apple than prune. If your kid likes to drink apple and prune juice then this product is fine but if you're looking for something to help with constipation you should look elsewhere.  What a waste.

review/text: My son can be constipated very easily. We tried everything. Lots of fiber and lots of water by themselves don't to the job for him. With prune juice is bingo! A must to have for us. Sadly I got a note that Amazon will no linger care prune juice by Gerber so, we tried pear juice and it does the same job for our son.

review/summary: Love this pasta
review/text: I really love this pasta. I have decreased my gluten intake over the past few months, and this pasta has just been fabulous. My traditional Italian SIL tried this pasta and loved it. It is not sticky like rice pasta or spelt pasta. Watch out though, it is very filling! Your first helping will probably do just fine, where as I could eat several helpings of pasta and still want more. Great product.

review/text: It's been some time since I've bought these, and saw them on sale 2-4-1 at a local store. The box seems about the same size as always, but the tiny little downsized cakes just shake around in it. I hope the stock holders are happy this year, because this is the last box I will ever buy. Even at two boxes for the price of one, these pint-sized cakes are no bargain. If they down-size them again, shoppers will have to buy two boxes to put together one little cake. The cakes are delicious, but barely big enough to taste anymore. There are still some generic companies out there making full-sized cakes, and, in light of this ridiculous miniaturizing, I would wholeheartedly recommend them over Hostess.

review/summary: Makes good chili
review/text: I was surprised at all my local grocery stores at the lack of larger packages of chili powder. All the brick and mortar grocery stores seem to offer just little tiny spice rack bottles of chili, about what is needed to make one nice pot of chili, at exorbitant prices. Buying this chili powder in bulk has been my private little consumer revolt.<br /><br />I am not qualified to comment on how this chili powder compares to other brands. But I do make no-frills, old-fashioned chili pretty often, and this chili powder has produced good results. Neither too wimpy for me, a spicy food lover, nor too spicy for my wife, who likes things mild. This chili powder, on its own, produces strong flavor without major heat. For a bit more of a kick, I mix in cayenne pepper.<br /><br />Don't let the corner grocery store rob you on chili powder any more. This is two pounds of chili powder. Not recommended for those who don't want to use quite a bit -- but if you do chili often, it's worth it.

review/summary: Bad ingredients that weren't disclosed on Amazon, but are listed on the packaging
review/text: I bought this chili powder with the intention of using it around the kitchen and for making chili. I recently tried using chili powder (not this one from Amazon, but one from a grocery store), and didn't feel like paying the higher price per pound buying it from a grocery store, so I found the one here on Amazon. There is an ingredient in here that I am not fond of whatsoever, hence the 1 star review. This ingredient is SILICON DIOXIDE.<br /><br />Here are a couple links with some general info:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Regardless of how "safe" some say it is to ingest, the fact that I would have potentially eaten something that is used to make glass or breast implants doesn't really sit right with me. Amazon should have disclosed ALL ingredients in their food products that they offer. I'm a bit upset that something I looked so forward to using now has to be returned, which means I now have to order a different one and wait several more days or so.

review/summary: Currants are a delicious addition
review/text: I use currants a lot. They are difficult to find in the supermarket so I am now on a subscription delivery system with Amazon. I put them in baked goods, in rice pilaff (with allspice and onions for an Armenian pilaff) in chick pea salads to add a touch of sweetness to a savory dish, in wild rice and farro salad, in a braised chicken dish with lots of onions, etc. You get the idea. They are not just for baking. You can be creative and add a handful wherever you want a bit of sweetness in a savory dish. Because they are tiny they can be a bit dry so it's best to soak them and drain them well before using. Or keep them in a container in the refrigerator after you've soaked and drained the entire box. That way they are ready to toss into whatever you are cooking that day.

review/summary: Holy Grapes!!!!
review/text: These are NOT CURRANTS.....These are a variety of grapes and I demand that they SHOULD be renamed "Raisins".  By no means, these are currants.  I was on a "Currant Hunt" since Jamie Oliver's recipe for summer fruit pudding.  I could not get fresh currants (beg, borrow, steal....Sigh...no luck).  So, the last resort was for dry currants (if not fresh, I thought I could atleast use rehydrated dry currants as substitute).  After about 2 months of search, I found a few packs of these at my local Kroger.  I should have read the description.  It was my fault.  These are a variety of grapes that are usually called "Zante Currants".  THAT'S IT.  Absolutely not related to currants.  My teacher Google taught me the lesson about these grapes.  Why is it so difficult here in the USA to find even the dry currants?<br /><br />These are VERY GOOD FOR RAISINS though.

review/text: Currants are, of course, dried fruit.  However, the currants in this delivery were over dried and quite inferior to the same product by the same manufacturer that I frequently purchase at my local grocery store.  Rather than having a moist freshness, the delivered currants were over dried out to point of having a granular crustiness.  No wonder they were sent to me under Subscribe and Save.  They must have been rejected for shipping to grocery stores dues to their deteriorated quality.  The seller should have indicated this prior to shipping.

review/summary: Great Coffee but BUYER BEWARE
review/text: I am giving this PRODUCT a 5 Star review because I've been drinking 8 O'Clock Colombian coffee for years and love it. However, when I ordered this from the merchant "Eauction,LLC" who uses Amazon to fulfill their orders I did not receive the Colombian coffee. I received the 8 O'Clock "Original" coffee which is 100% arabica beans but is NOT Colombian. Based upon a 2009 review, for this same product, another consumer had the same problem. Fortunately, as this is fulfilled by Amazon returning it for a full refund was easy breezy and return shipping was paid by the merchant or Amazon.<br /><br />I highly recommend this coffee but I would encourage you to buy it from another source at Amazon's Web site or you'll likely not get the product that's advertised and even though returns and refunds are handled professionally and promptly by Amazon, it's still a hassle to have to tape the box up, put the label on, and take it to the Post Office and retain the tracking number so you'll know Amazon received it in case the refund is not issued in a timely manner upon receipt of the return by Amazon.

review/text: There is nowhere in the Hawaiian Island chain to buy Eight O'clock coffee. If you call the company they tell you it's available at Super Walmarts ( we don't have 'super' Walmarts and the others do NOT carry it) and when I would try to order online everything would go fine until I put in my address and then the seller would say " sorry we cannot ship gourmet items to Hawaii". So finally I find a company , God bless em, who will ship here ( Hawaiian coffee is quite expensive by the way, especially pure  Kona which can be over $30 lb) and I purchased Eight O'clock Columbian (AH - Light Vienna Roast-not burned beans- and higher in caffeine too) in the largest bag available 42oz ....and it arrived! YEAH! I have only one small complaint which is the shipping cost ...very high ... You can ship items like this via USPS Priority Mail for less than half of what I was charged here and it would have arrived in 3-5 days. OTher than that the coffee is great and the order came in about a week. Companies PLEASE consider shipping USPS tp Hawaii customers instead of ripping us with UPS and FEDEX charges!

review/text: I saw a clip about dehydrated dog food in my email from a holistic vet site.  It was explained that dehydrated was a good go between when switching a dog from regular unhealthy processed food to a raw diet.  I decided to try it.  I bought the trial 4 oz. box.  In the past, my dog has been the pickiest eater there is.  He will only eat one brand of food...and believe me I have tried them all.  When I feed him, the food sits in the bowl and he nibbles.  It takes an entire day for him to eat one cup of food.  I removed his food bowl last night and didn't feed him.  I figured I would let him get good an hungry.  This morning, I measured out 1/2 cup of Thrive and heated up 1/2 cup of water.  When I mixed it, it looked like soup.  After I let it re-hydrate it looked even worse.  I figured he would never eat it.  I set it down and he ATE THE WHOLE BOWL in one sitting.  Maxx LOVES it.  I just ordered a 10 lb. box.  Thank you Honest Kitchen for giving me a healthy food to feed my best friend that he really enjoyed.

review/text: In the last couple of months, my 4.5 year old Maltichon decided to be extremely particular about the food he ate. I went through several high grade kibble and wet food (Natural Balance/Acana/California Natural) but he refused to eat it. Ultimately, he went on a food strike and started to lose weight. I went back to researching food and found this on Amazon. I figured I had nothing to lose, my dog wasn't eating much already. When I introduced the Honest Kitchen, he sniffed, licked and then proceeded to inhale like he hadn't eaten in weeks (which he hadn't).<br /><br />He is now finally starting to gain back some of the weight he had lost while on his food strike. Just about the only thing he hates about this food is having to wait the 5 minutes for it to rehydrate!

review/text: I've only recently learned about the benefits of the mangosteen fruit, so I can't tell you whether all of the claims about it are true or not. My son is convinced that it cures his headaches and it seems to have helped my daughter's seasonal allergies. I CAN tell you that this brand of mangosteen juice tastes really good compared to Xango (although Xango is good too) and it is much cheaper. Still, I will have to use it for a longer period of time to know if it helps with other ailments, such as arthritis.<br /><br />I appreciate that the product tell what percentage of mangosteen it actually contains (50%). I've tried to find out the percentage in Xango, but have been unable to do so.<br /><br />Bottom line? If you are worried about using aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen, for your aches and pains, this may be a healthy alternative. A lot more expensive, mind you, but without the stomach irritation of some of the otc medicines.

They are lacking the sweetness you might of thought, yet looking at the ingredients there is not much sugar in them.  They have a really good taste though, as pumpkin pie does.  These would be great in or on a pumpkin pie with the added flavor, or even added to some ice cream.  if you have a sweet tooth, than perhaps these are not for you.  If you like the musty and pungent taste of pumpkin and pumpkin pie.  Enjoy.

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: This is the best curry paste I have ever used. It's delicious. Simple. Very impressive as a dinner for guests or friends. This creates the illusion you have put a lot more work into the dinner than you actually did.<br /><br />I highly recommend it. I bought many jars of this from a local grocery before they stopped carrying it. Which is a shame. I've tried many others since and nothing compares to this.

review/summary: A decent introduction to Indian spices
review/text: My favorite Indian cuisine is from the South, and Patak's Madras curry paste is a good first step in using some of its flavors, particularly tamarind, which is hard to find outside of Indian food stores.<br /><br />There are some natural limitations to this paste because you have a fixed proportion of spices - The best results come from using it in "dry" cooking like sauteeing. Contrary to the vegetarian cuisine of South India, this paste is superb as a marinade or glaze for grilled meat (you don't have to add anything else) - the result is like a Southeast Asian satay.<br /><br />However, in "wet" cooking, like curry or dal, the proportions are off and you'll want to use your own spices if you can. In this case, at least the paste gives you an easy source of tamarind flavor.<br /><br />It is not quite hot enough for me, but you can always add chiles. The ginger flavor is kept tastefully subtle  - something I find difficult when using my own spices. This paste is a welcome product since using the right balance of spices from scratch is a skill that takes time to develop.

review/summary: Patak Curry Paste
review/text: I have used Patak's for years, and love it. Very convenient way of getting authentic curry at home without having to mix all the spices yourself. Not only is it good for making curry, but it is good for adding a bit of spice to other recipes as well. I like it for deviled eggs, meat marinades and other recipes that can sometimes use a bit of a kick. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Pecan Pie, 3 Ingredients, How DO they do it?!
review/text: WOW! I recently tried Lara Bar for the first time, and have tried several flavors now. Who knew an energy/meal bar could be this good? Simply amazing!<br /><br />My favorite is the PECAN PIE FLAVOR. It satisfies my craving for an actual pecan pie, and it only has 3 ingredients! The ingredients are: dates, pecans, almonds. That's it! I cannot figure out how they make it taste like pie with only these ingredients but they do. How wonderful to have an item with such a short healthy ingredient list.<br /><br />My second favorite so far is the Lemon Bar, it's really good too, and has only 5 ingredients. Key Lime Pie is good... heck, they're all good!<br /><br />So refreshing to eat something that tastes so decadent, and is made from whole foods, thanks Lara Bar! :-)

I don't love the flavor of this bar as much as other Larabars.  With all the bars Larabar offers, I probably won't buy ginger snap again. I will definitely stick with Larabar, though.

review/summary: Larabar Key Lime Pie
review/text: Yum!  This was my first experience with a Larabar and I really liked it.  I love key lime pie to begin with, so I was beyond excited to find a bar in that flavor.<br /><br />While it didn't taste exactly like a Key Lime Pie, this bar did have a lot of lime flavor.  It also had some crunchy nuts that contrasted nicely with the almost fruit chews texture of the rest of the bar.  I also was able to taste the hint of coconut in there as well.  Between those three flavors, it tasted very fresh and almost like I was eating a fruit salad in bar form.  Definitely a pleasant experience.<br /><br />The ingredient list on this bar is phenomenal.  Only 5 ingredients are in it:  dates, cashews, almonds, coconut, and lime juice.  That's it, no hard to pronounce ingredients, no added sweeteners, just plain food that is easily recognized by just about anyone.  In fact, according to the package, because of those ingredients, this bar equals 1/4 of a cup of fruit.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, this bar is about on par with most other fitness bars.  It has 220 calories, which is high for a snack but good for if you're working out or as a meal replacement.  Sugars are high, 24 grams, but at least it's from all natural foods and not because they dumped a pile of sugar in the bar.  There's also some vitamins hiding in there, but those too aren't from vitamins injected into the food.<br /><br />A pretty good bar.  I'm eager to try out the other Larabars and see if they're just as good.  And I know I'll definitely be buying this one again.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Simply Delightful
review/text: I love a Larabar as a snack at work.  I don't get breaks or lunches, so I eat one mid-shift which holds me over well until I get home to eat a real meal.  They're convenient to throw in my purse, and are easy to eat.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Super healthy.  Three simple ingredients, no fillers, no added sugars.<br />- Good source of protein, plus a handful of vitamins and minerals.<br />- Very tasty.  Slightly sweet, and fresh peanut taste.<br />- Soft and chewy, easy to eat.  The peanuts are ground into small pieces, which I really like.  They're plentiful and blended perfectly with the dates.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Make me thirsty.  I recommend at least a little water after eating.<br />- A bit pricey.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I just love these Larabars.  They don't taste just like a peanut butter cookie, but they do have a wonderful flavor which I found surprising given the ingredients.  I love that there is no added sugars.  One bar makes me feel great after I eat it, and there is no sugar crash later on.  With protein and fiber, it's a great choice.  Also, it's gluten-free and dairy-free for individuals who cannot consume either of those two things.<br /><br />I highly recommend!

review/summary: Gingerbread without the guilt
review/text: At Christmastime, I made gingerbread men that I rolled out thick so they would retain their softness. They were good -- so good that I put on more pounds than I wanted because I enjoyed them so. But it's hard to find that spicy ginger taste that satisfies. Most gingerbreads and gingersnaps are lacking.<br /><br />In February, I started eating paleo. (Look it up - I won't explain it here.) For the occasional "cheat," I wanted something naturally sweetened without glutens or grains. Many paleo/primal websites recommend Larabars. I've eaten them before but never the Ginger Snap variety.<br /><br />O.M.G. They hit the spot and then some. What an indulgence -- and they remind me of my fattening gingerbread men from Christmas. Soft and chewy with that marvelous gingerbread taste. So worth it.<br /><br />So whether you're eating paleo, gluten free, natural whole foods or just want a good for you treat, Ginger Snap is it for ginger lovers.

review/text: This Larabar tastes just like a cinnamon roll!!!  I don't know how those Larabar people do it, but whatever the flavor of Larabar it is, it tastes just like the real thing!!!  This particular Larabar is cinnamon roll, therefore, it goes good with a cup of coffee.  And in this cold weather lately, good hot coffee has been welcome!!!  I've been having my share lately of good hot coffee and Larabars!!!  And if you like cinnamon rolls, I'm sure you would love this particular Larabar.<br /><br />And for hot weather, or for the flavors of Larabars that go better with cold beverages, cold iced tea works very well also with Larabars.<br /><br />Oh, and I need to tell you, Larabars are natural - no added sugar, only natural sugar from fruits.  There are no bad ingredients.  There is also no soy.  Larabars are healthy, convenient, filling, perfect.  And vegan.  And even if you aren't vegan, you can still eat Larabars because they are so good.  They are so good, you forget that they are made from healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Cinnamon Roll Larabar.  Highly Recommended.

I've got to say that I think these are one of the best tasting bars I've eaten... ever. I love the tangy taste of the cherry and it is also good news to me that it is made with raw ingredients, no added sugar and no saturated fat (cholesterol free).<br /><br />The closest thing I could equate this bar to would be the inside of a fig newton cookie. It's firmer though and has more pronounced cherry flavor. I find it satisfying and I do "feel good" about eating it. I also like Cliff Bars but if I had only these two to choose from, I'd choose the Larabar Cherry Pie. Yum.

review/text: These are, like all LaraBars, flavorful, filling, and made of simple ingredients.  The flavor wasn't all I'd hoped, given some of the reviews - they're cherry pie LaraBars with chopped peanuts added - a little peanut taste as you bite into them, and a peanut aftertaste.  What I loved about peanut butter sandwiches was the way the richness of the peanut butter contrasted with the fruitiness of the jelly.<br /><br />These bars don't do it for me, since they lack the rich peanut butter taste I love.  However, they're not at all bad in themselves (just not so good that they'd make my favorites list, where apple pie remains at the top, though I've never tried a LaraBar I really didn't like).

review/summary: As healthy as bars get
review/text: The raw nuts and fruits in these bars make them as close to nature as anything you will find in a wrapper. The Larabar reminds me of the naturally zesty and sweet fruit rolls I used to eat as a kid but also has wonderful, flavorfull fresh nuts mixed in. Raw nuts contain healthy fats and the protein and fat in the nuts will lower the glycemic index of the food. If you don't want to lug around raw cherries and a snack bag of raw nuts, this is the convenient alternative.<br /><br />Keep in mind, these are excellent treats for pets too. They are especially nice for birds who like to pick at the dried fruit and munch on the raw nuts. If you are going to offer these to a pet, please check the ingredients to be sure they are compatible with your species of pet.

review/summary: Best Bars I've Found
review/text: I've tried many bars over the years, from snack bars to energy bars. These bars are the best tasting and are great in any flavor, but my favorite flavor is Peanut Butter Cookie as it's not too sweet. Being gluten sensitive and struggling with low blood sugar, Lara Bars are the perfect balanced snack for me when on the go whether I'm running errands or exercising. I ride a bicycle for many miles and carry a couple of Lara Bars, some fruit, and water. As a result, I feel sufficiently fueled for my rides and do not encounter any stomach distress.

review/summary: Yummy G/F Alternative!
review/text: First let me state that I've only tried 3 flavors so far (chocolate coconut, cocoa mole', and apple pie).<br /><br />I found chocolate coconut to be my least favorite. Normally I like the chocolate coconut combination, but in this brand it just didn't work for me!  If I had to rate it, I'd only give it 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that cocoa mole' was a huge improvement (so if you're in the mood for something chocolaty- I would highly recommend this)!!  The cinnamon/chili combo is very unique (but shouldn't be a surprise if you know what mole' is).  The cinnamon is comforting, and the chili gives it a little zing- with a faint hint of heat.<br /><br />  The apple pie flavor is so far my favorite out of the three.  You can definitely taste the distinct apple cinnamon flavor.  I'm not sure if I encountered a rasin in mine though.  I also like that it has walnuts in it.<br /><br />  Anyway, I can't wait to sample other flavors!  ..I hope they come up with a new flavor that involves macadamia nuts!!
