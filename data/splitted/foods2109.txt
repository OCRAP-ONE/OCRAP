review/summary: Good tasting hard candy, 90-95% like the fruit.
review/text: Lychee [aka Litchi chinensis] is an Asian tropical fruit with a thin peel-able skin that comes in bunches like grapes.  The fruit itself has a diluted transparent milky white color and is very sweet with a slight hint of sourness.  The skin and the pit of the fruit is not eatable.  Kasagai has made this hard candy to taste 90-95% like the fruit, in my opinion.  This candy contains no actual fruit or fruit juice, unlike their gummy candies.  Bear in mind this is a hard candy, and is not a gummy candy, which they also make (that taste really like you're actually munching on fruit).  These are usually available in your local Asian Grocery stores, but can be a nice find from Amazon if you don't have one close to where you live.<br /><br />On the back of the actual plastic candy package, it is labeled "Manufactured on shared equipment that process MILK ingredients".  It is FYI for those of you with milk related product allergies to consider.<br /><br />The candy does taste good, and if you have a chance to taste the real fruit, you should give it a try, but until you get to eat the real fruit, this is a good alternative.

review/summary: Best deal on the net
review/text: After many hours of research of various internet sources of raw whole cashews, this deal is the best deal ever, unless you wanna step up and buy really bulk quantities like 25 to infinity pounds, there price per pound will be even better, but you would pay a lot upfront. We already ordered 3 times from that seller (Spicy World), and will do more. We are vegetarians eating mostly raw food, so those nuts are very important part of a diet to us.<br /><br />As for cashews themselves - they are amazing, very tasty, much better (and cheaper) than fried salted c?#p they sell in stores like Walmart and Target. Their taste is soft and little sweet. They are incredibly satisfying. They are not hard like almonds. They can sit for very long time making it a perfect emergency/outdoor food!<br /><br />Check this nutrition info out:<br /><br />NUTRITION INFORMATION for "Cashew nuts, raw"<br />(source: [...])<br /><br />Amounts per 1 ounce (28g)<br /><br />Calorie Information<br />Amounts Per Selected Serving %DV<br />Calories 155 (649 kJ) 8%<br />  From Carbohydrate 34.4 (144 kJ)<br />  From Fat 103 (431 kJ)<br />  From Protein 17.7 (74.1 kJ)<br />  From Alcohol ~ (0.0 kJ)<br /><br />Carbohydrates<br />Amounts Per Selected Serving %DV<br />Total Carbohydrate 9.2g 3%<br />Dietary Fiber 0.9g 4%<br />Starch 6.6g<br />Sugars 1.7g<br />Sucrose 1627mg<br />Glucose 14.0mg<br />Fructose 14.0mg<br />Lactose 0.0mg<br />Maltose 0.0mg<br />Galactose 0.0mg<br /><br />Fats & Fatty Acids<br />Amounts Per Selected Serving %DV<br />Total Fat 12.3g 19%<br />Saturated Fat 2.2g 11%<br />Monounsaturated Fat 6.7g<br />Polyunsaturated Fat 2.2g<br />Total trans fatty acids ~<br />Total trans-monoenoic fatty acids ~<br />Total trans-polyenoic fatty acids ~<br />Total Omega-3 fatty acids 17.4mg<br />Total Omega-6 fatty acids 2179mg<br /><br />Protein & Amino Acids<br />Amounts Per Selected Serving %DV<br />Protein 5.1g 10%<br /><br />Vitamins<br />Amounts Per Selected Serving %DV<br />Vitamin A 0.0IU 0%<br />Vitamin C 0.1mg 0%<br />Vitamin D ~ ~<br />Vitamin E (Alpha Tocopherol) 0.3mg 1%<br />Vitamin K 9.5mcg 12%<br />Thiamin 0.1mg 8%<br />Riboflavin 0.0mg 1%<br />Niacin 0.3mg 1%<br />Vitamin B60.1mg 6%<br />Folate 7.0mcg 2%<br />Vitamin B1 20.0mcg 0%<br />Pantothenic Acid 0.2mg 2%<br />Choline ~<br />Betaine ~<br /><br />Minerals<br />Amounts Per Selected Serving %DV<br />Calcium 10.4mg 1%<br />Iron 1.9mg 10%<br />Magnesium 81.8mg 20%<br />Phosphorus 166mg 17%<br />Potassium 185mg 5%<br />Sodium 3.4mg 0%<br />Zinc 1.6mg 11%<br />Copper 0.6mg 31%<br />Manganese 0.5mg 23%<br />Selenium 5.6mcg 8%<br />Fluoride ~<br /><br />Sterols<br />Amounts Per Selected Serving %DV<br />Cholesterol 0.0mg0%<br />Phytosterols ~<br /><br />Other<br />Amounts Per Selected Serving %DV<br />Alcoho l0.0g<br />Water 1.5g<br />Ash 0.7g<br />Caffeine ~<br />Theobromine ~<br /><br />How about that?!

review/text: This is the best, most affordable decaf Earl Grey looseleaf tea I have been able to find (and I have put a lot of effort into sampling a variety of products). It is an incredibly aromatic start to the morning-have to stick my nose in it every day. Plus, their decaf uses the CO2 process which avoids harmful additives; as a result, the leaves are broken down into smaller bits, but this doesn't bother me because I think it brings out the bergamot aroma. A routine comfort for me!

review/summary: Just what I was looking for
review/text: I have been searching for a TVP product for a while now and when I saw Bob's Red Mill TVP on the net I looked for it at Amazon and there it was.  I hadn't used it in years, so it was a new learning experience and I got an acceptable burger on my first try, but not quite what I was looking for.  With a lot more research on the net I discovered that a mixture of TVP and Vital Wheat  Gluten, also from Bob's Red Mill and available at Amazon,  will give you a much meatier burger. There are several websites that can help you, one is Vegan Dad, which can give you a recipe that will help you find a better burger that isn't so mushy as TVP can be, also check out Thrifty Living. If you are trying TVP for the first time, don't give up on it. Go out to You Tube and type in TVP burger recipes and see what you can find. Also check out Everyday Dish on You Tube. It is a learning experience for sure.

review/summary: Excellent Way to Stretch Budget, Improve Health
review/text: Although I've been a vegetarian and even vegan at times in my life, currently I'm not.  I was so happy to find this great price on Bob's Red Mill TVP.  It's less than half of what I'd pay at my local grocery store--and only one of the stores in my area regularly even carries it.<br /><br />If you worry about both health and price, TVP is a great addition to your diet. I use it in conjunction with ground beef.  I rehydrate it using beef stock, and then add it to my ground beef.  If you're new to TVP, I'd start with rehydrating 1/4 to 1/2 cup and adding it to one pound of beef.  You can go up to a 50/50 blend--and most people will not be able to tell the difference, especially in things like chili and meatballs.  My kids and husband have no idea. :)<br /><br />If you buy the 80/20 ground beef--by mixing it with no-fat, high protein, high fiber TVP, you will halve the fat you eat per serving.  Because it doubles the amount of beef you get, you can also use this as a way to buy free-range or lower fat meat for your family.  Although $4 or $5/pound is a lot for many families--by cutting it with TVP, your true cost is $2-$2.50.  Much more affordable.<br /><br />I really recommend giving it a try. You can buy one cup at the bulk foods section of many health food stores to give it a try. Definitely hydrate it with beef stock for added flavor.  If your family likes it, then buy it on Amazon.  Good luck!

review/text: This is my first time using tvp. Tvp is really easy to prepare and inexpensive when compared to ground meat. To me, it doesn't taste like meat, but it has the same texture in my mouth, just not that greasy flavor. It works well in recipes too. A much healthier alternative to ground beef. We love this stuff. Each bag has about 2 cups dried tvp, which will make a couple of meals.

review/summary: Versatile, Easy to Use, Tasty!
review/text: I've never used TVP before this, so I wasn't sure quite what to expect when I purchased this product. So far I've used one whole bag and I couldn't be happier with it. My whole family enjoys eating the food I've made with TVP instead of ground beef, and so far I haven't noticed any stomach issues in anyone, even the baby. (And though I was a little unnerved by another reviewer's comment on the smell, I didn't really notice anything more than a subtle grain scent when I put my nose in the bag.)<br /><br />The first thing I did with my TVP was to take the liquid left from making a pot roast in my crockpot, skim away most of the fat, and use the liquid to rehydrate the TVP. It made a really delicious meatloaf-tasting crumble that we ate in sandwiches with ketchup. A few days later, I made a homemade spaghetti sauce with TVP simmered right in, and that turned out great too. I did notice that the TVP made the recipe just a little sweeter than it would've been, but I compensated with extra spices. I would leave the sugar out of the sauce recipe next time I make it with TVP. And last night, I rehydrated the last cup of TVP in the bag with water I'd mixed a packet of taco seasoning into. It made a very serviceable taco meat substitute for beefy taco macaroni and cheese.<br /><br />Just from my one bag, one quarter of my order, I got three meals for my family, which works out to less than seventy-five cents of TVP per meal. I don't know that I'll ever try to actually make a hamburger with this, but I just love it for any recipe calling for ground beef. Instead of defrosting and cooking a pound of beef, rehydrating a cup of TVP is fast and simple. I will definitely buy this again.

review/text: So I got this because a friend of mine mentioned it and I was all like, let's do this.  Well, the TVP Black Bean Enchiladas were the bomb!  If we hadn't told our other friend, I'm pretty sure he would have never known it wasn't beef or turkey.<br /><br />You have to use a recipe with some flavor in it.  We made ours with vegetable stock, but beef stock would help, if you are a meat eater just supplemented or reducing.  It makes a lot though.  One bag was half a bag too much for us, so watch your measurements, you might try a little less than it calls for.<br /><br />This is a great substitute for meat in things like enchiladas and spaghettis sauces and stuff.  Haven't tried combining it with real meat in a meatloaf or something to cut down on meat in stuff.  Maybe that's the next experiment...

review/summary: A staple for Vegetarian newcomers who still crave meat
review/text: T.V.P., three wonderful letters known to most vegetarians. Let me say that I still eat meat (*gasp!*), but I am trying to transition to a vegetarian diet. Rather than going cold turkey (or cold tofu maybe?), I figured I'll try to work in one or two vegetarian meals into my week. That isn't so easy when you feel like there's nothing to satisfy that chew, that texture that only meat seems to exhibit. Enter Textured Vegetable Protein. When I first heart of it, I thought "what a weird sounding product". But reviews said it provides a meat-like texture in meals, and it was cheap, so I figured why not. While TVP may not look too appealing (soylent green anyone?), and the smell when raw is a bit unpleasant, it is a wonderful product. It really does have the texture of ground meat when reconstituted in boiling liquids. And just like tofu, it's a flavor sponge, adapting to any spice or flavor you throw at it (warning: throwing spices at something could be a messy affair). I've made tacos, chilli, used it for spaghetti and meatballs, and made some pretty good veggie burgers with it. I also took the suggestion of using it to extend the ground turkey I had in my house, so even my meat meals are turning vegetarian!<br /><br />I know I'm barely cracking the surface of what this stuff can be used for. I just want to say to any meat eater considering going the vegetarian route, it's not all gloom and doom. TVP will help you out. In fact, you can say TVP = The Vegetarian Pathway (I just made that up while typing, but it seemed fitting!). The value is great too; with Subscribe and Save, amazon's price is much cheaper than what I find at my local grocery store. This will be a staple in my pantry for quite some time. I'm already on my third order in fact.

This by far is the best deal around because I would pay far more at Whole Foods for the same brand. Quality means a lot along with taste, and Bob's Red Mill has both! Use this in place of all your ground beef/turkey recipes. I'm vegan and my family is not, they can't tell the difference when I make burgers, spaghetti or sloppy joe's. That's a good thing! Full of better nutrients than any meat could ever provide and this is much better for you. Do your own research then give this TVP a try. You will be satisfied. I liked this so much, I now have it on the "subscribe and save" here on Amazon!

I can flavor this however I want, just throw it in some chili, make "taco meat" with it, make "BBQs" with it, and so much more.<br />I haven't purchased TVP from other companies, but can say that I do like this brand of TVP, so I haven't really needed to search for any other kind.

review/text: Excellent product which I just discovered.  My family is not vegetarians or vegans, but can use this product as a meat extender. It's more healthful and a little meat mixed with this goes a long way. I made a spaghetti sauce with just the TVP, but something seemed lacking in flavor so I added a little bit of ground meat and the flavor improved. It was like a meatful spaghetti sauce, but actually it was a blend of about 80% TVP mixed with 20% beef. Now we can eat more healthy by reducing our meat consumption. I'll be thinking of more ways to use this product and will definitely keep this in my pantry.

I put a case every month inside my food storage program. To substitute for beef, redydrate with Beef Bouillon. FOr chicken,use Chicken Bouillon. If you're a vegetarian,use vegetable broth! LGW

review/summary: Pretty good if you do it right.
review/text: The product came promptly and as advertised. I have used it a few times once it was a mess and barely edible but that was my fault for not heating the water I used to soak it in. Not a bad product but nothing I would crave eating. It does a good job of adapting to the flavor so if you are looking for something that looks and feels like ground meat this fits the bill but do not expect it to have an outstanding flavor on its own you need to season it with hot broth or water on your own.

review/summary: Good way to get protein while cutting down on meat
review/text: We're trying to eat less meat - but still love dishes like meatloaf, meatball soup, etc.  I've been using this TVP (plus some additional seasoning) to substitute for half the meat in some favorite recipes and both of us eat them happily, though it's taken a bit of experimenting to get quite the same taste and texture.  I look at dishes that call for plain TVP but am not so sure I'm ready to try them yet<br /><br />When a dietician told me I should to add more protein to my breakfast and suggested adding an egg (ugh - really don't like eggs), I tried adding a couple of tablespoons of it in my morning oatmeal.  It needs a bit of flavoring (cinnamon and/or raisins plus some stevia for sweetening) to keep from tasting like dog kibble, but with the flavoring it tastes great and I can really tell the difference in the amount of energy I have in the morning.

review/text: This stuff is amazing for my blood sugars and keeping them down when pasta, rice, bread make it skyrocket (unless eating less than 1/4 cup).  It's fun to experiment with it by adding spices/herbs and challenge myself with different recipes.<br /><br />It is also a great thing to replace with meat (since 99% turkey grounds can cost up to $7 a lb).  This stuff is cheap and 1 cup dry makes a hell of a lot of food.<br /><br />I use it so much I had to up the amount I purchase from Amazon.

review/text: I'm not a vegetarian but I do like to use TVP to extend and sometimes replace meat.  I've tried beef-flavored TVP from another company which I really like but the unflavored has the advantage of being very low sodium.  I've used Bob's Red Mill TVP in chili and tacos and both came out great.  I've tried a meatball recipe and I loved it, hubby not so much.  He likes the flavored stuff better, but I will keep some of this on hand to flavor any way I want.

This will cut your fat from meals, you can also use half ground beef and half TVP. The next day it tastes even better, and most people can't tell the difference.

review/summary: Good, cheap, but...
review/text: I bought this before finding out about how it is manufactured (using hexane). I need to do a bit more research before I decide whether or not I'd repurchase. That said, I really like the product itself. It is incredibly cheap (1 cup dried TVP + 1 cup boiling water or broth = about 3/4 pound) and has a slightly chewy texture that is reminiscent of meat, in my opinion. It really absorbs the flavor of whatever you cook it in, unlike tofu, which can be terribly bland if not marinaded. As a vegetarian, I like the versatility this affords me: basically any recipe that calls for ground meat can be made using an equal weight of hydrated TVP. I made sloppy joes with it the night it arrived, and hardly missed the meat. Veggie burgers, vegan chili, meatless bolognese, etc., are other good options. I have read that some eat it as sort of a breakfast porridge, and I can see how it would work (since the product itself is fairly flavorless), but I stuck with savory options.

review/summary: Oh wow!
review/text: First off, I was very apprehensive about trying this product, because I had tried the Harmony House brand of TVP (Beefish Bits), and I wasn't that pleased with it,  but their dehydrated veggies were just fine.  But, on to this review, Bob's Red Mill TVP is amazing :)  I tried my best to find something wrong with this TVP when I made some sample recipes like soy burgers and chilli, but I couldn't find anything wrong with either meals, and flavor and consistency was pretty spot on and tasted very good.  I still can't believe that this stuff really takes on the flavor of whatever you throw at it.  I'm happy I tried it and I plan to stock up on this TVP and keep some for emergency food supply.  I wish I had tried this months before now.  Could have saved me lots of money.  Thanks to all of you who left really detailed reviews that prompted my purchase.  If you're on the fence, just try it out, I'm certain you would like it very much.

review/summary: The perfect substitute.
review/text: This is basically just soy flour with the fat removed. The result is textured vegetable protein, a great vegan substitute for ground beef (especially in light of the pink slime scandal), sausage, etc...We mostly use this for tacos and burritos in our home, and cooked into pasta. It is as simple to prepare as just throwing some in a hot skillet with water and whatever seasoning/vegetables/starch you are going to use and cooking until hot. For the subscribe & save price of under $9 for 4 packages, i also consider this to be a great deal. Things like TVP really make a vegan diet far more comprehensive and accessible. I love the stuff.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: I used to get this in the grocery store, but it seems to be unavailable now. I am happy to find this product again. TVP - texturized vegetable protein - is a good protein substitute for any recipe calling for ground meat. It can be seasoned as you would any meat product. It is an economical replacement for meat, or can be used in combination with ground meat to reduce the fat, and the cost. We are  not vegetarians, but choose to eat more plant based meals for many reasons.  We enjoy using this high quality product. It is soy based.

review/summary: An aid for healthy living and eating!
review/text: Since the new year I have made a vow to start eating  for a healthier lifestyle. My doctor last year told me I am morbidly obsese and  a BMI near 50. I am tall, but there is no reason for me to be this big. As apart of my new lifestyle,I adopted a low carb lifestyle CHANGE not DIET . I have replaced my cabinet with coconut flour, almond meal and have eaten shirataki noodles to replace my noodle fettish. Most recently after reading the review, I have purchased this product from my grocery store. I had TVP before and it was good, but just didn't know the name of it and that it was so readily available as it is. I am cooking my TVP (first time)  with my shirataki noodles as I am typing this. I sampled this and it is delicious . As a result of a month on this low carb diet, I have lost nearly twenty pounds. Get this product, it is low carb as well as it adapts to any dish. It is essential to healthy living, and it is cheap if not cheaper as getting ground beef,or chicken breasts from the store and it doesn't have that saturated fat. I look forward to updating my review to say that I have successfully trimmed my carbs and fat from my diet.

review/summary: An flexible alternate to meat
review/text: First, I would like to note that this is an all soy product, so those with gluten issues should find it readily digestible.  It is made from defatted soy beans, so it is also fa free - if that is an issue for you.  I have used this to make sloppy joes, chili, taco filling, bbq sandwich filling, and burgers.  My 74 year old mother, who never eats vegetarian, had one of the burgers and loved it.  The four pack is an excellent value.  Each bag provides about 12 protein servings.  I have found that I get the tastiest results re-hydrating the granules with Better than Bouillon vegetable base and/or mushroom base (available here on Amazon).  Tomato juice is another excellent option.  The dry granules are more or less flavorless - so using a well seasoned liquid gives a much better final result.  Even if you don't eat vegetarian or vegan, this is still an excellent product to use.  Rehydrate one cup of granules and mix with 1 pound of ground meat and mix up as for a 2# meatloaf.  But don't bake it in a loaf pan - you get a better result by making individual patties or more of a broad flat slab.  Baking in a loaf format everything cooks thoroughly but tends to be too soft to be truly satisfying.  There isn't a lot to say about this product except it is wholesome economical and very easy to use.  If you are trying to lower your grocery bill, this is a very good option.

review/text: I used this to make my own lower-fat version of turkey italian sausage and hamburger crumbles. For both, I hydrated the TVP before mixing with the meat.  For turkey italian sausage, I added 2 cups of warm water to two cups of TVP, then mixed with two pounds of ground turkey. To this I added minced garlic, italian seasonings, salt, ground pepper, and fennel seed.  You can also add dried red pepper if you like a hot version.  I let it sit in a covered bowl in the refrigerator overnight so the flavors could blend.  The next day, I browned the whole lot and divided the mixture into 5 quart sized freezer bags.  When I want to make a dish with crumbled Italian sausage, I just pull a bag from the freezer.  For ground beef, I also did a one cup TVP to one pound ground beef mixture, browned with a little garlic powder, salt and pepper, and stored crumbles in the freezer.  This lowers my grocery bill for meat, makes throwing something together for dinner a lot quicker (which keeps me away from the fast food places), and lowers the fat content of our meals.  What could be better than that???

I use it in a lot of recipes from my favorite Vegan Cook Book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1935618121">The Happy Herbivore Cookbook: Over 175 Delicious Fat-Free and Low-Fat Vegan Recipes</a>.  Makes great TVP Tacos, TVP Ground Beef and Bacon Bits.  My Wife and I went through the whole case in 6 weeks!

review/summary: Better than the Whole Foods Version
review/text: I used to buy TVP in the bulk section at Whole Foods, but I use a lot and the price was too high.  Bob's Red Mill makes excellent TVP, and it even tastes a little sweeter (very subtly) than the other brand I used.  I love it and the price is right!  Great vegan staple and YUMMY in baked ziti!

review/summary: Ground "meat" in a package
review/text: TVP or textured vegetable protein is not a meat product but has protein 12g per 1/4 cup no cholesterol, 7g of carbs per same 1/4 cup of TVP and of course fiber as TVP is made from soybeans. Rehydrated, with whatever liquid you choose, this product is cheaper than ground meat, and can be used in nearly every recipe one would use ground meat.<br />Costs of TVP are better than ground meat in the stores. As it has a great shelf life there is no extra cost of refrigeration or freezing.  Since TVP has a great shelf life and is therefore a good traveler. May be used camping; add some to a stew of veggies or when meat might be low or scarce in the pot. I enjoy TVP in chili and as "hamburgers" made with TVP and beans of my choice. Find your own great recipe and try some TVP.

review/summary: Peanut and Tree Nut Allergy Sufferers Beware
review/text: I can't say anything about the quality, taste, texture, touch, smell, substance or general quality of this product. Unfortunately, I found out only after ordering and receiving this product that it was "manufactured in a facility that uses tree nuts and soy." While I appreciate the fact that the manufacturers mention this on the packaging, it would have helped me greatly to have this information noted on the product information page. I just now checked the Amazon page again and there is no mention of this incredibly important information. For those of you without family members that suffer from peanut and tree nut allergies, go for it, but for the many of us that do live with these challenges, steer clear of this product. I would also hesitate to purchase any other products from this manufacturer without first verifying with them that product was not manufactured in a facility that uses tree nuts. !!!Wait!! Just checked their website and there's not a single reference to allergens (other than gluten) in their products. Actually, they seem to have a rather ample offering of products of gluten-free goods, but this does little for those with other allergies. Lastly, I don't expect every product to be free of peanuts and tree nuts, but I do expect the manufacturer to make it known to me if they have these ingredients in their products or are using a facility where these ingredients are used in other products. Unfortunately, Bob's Red Mill has done neither for their website or for their product page on Amazon. While I could return the product in another box (original one was already thrown out), it is too much trouble/hassle to do so. Thanks Bob!!

review/summary: I haven't smelled anything like this since leaving the chicken farm
review/text: I've heard a lot of good things about TVP and have enjoyed other Red Mill products, but if all TVP is this horrid then it'll never find a place in my pantry again. The directions called for rehydrating 1 cup of TVP with 7/8 cup boiling water. As soon as the boiling water hit the TVP a smell exactly the same as chicken poo came wafting up from the bowl. All the bowl contained was TVP and boiling water but the smell made me gag. I covered the bowl with a plate while the TVP soaked for 10 minutes as directed on the package. When I removed the cover the smell burst forth like chicken poo from hell! I hoped the smell would go away when I added the TVP to the pasta, red sauce, and mushrooms but it didn't. Eventually I had to add a lot of extra oregano, basil, rosemary, and Parmesan cheese to only barely cover the smell and taste of the TVP. This has got to be one of the worst things I've ever tried and this is from a guy who cooks and eats June bugs!

There was no garlic, no flavor at all, except for what I can only describe as disgusting.  The bottles went in the trash.  If there was a zero star option, I would have chosen it.

I go through it so quickly that I had to order a case!

review/summary: One Friday, Without the Milk
review/text: He always brought home milk on Friday.<br /><br />After a long hard week full of days he would burst through the door, his fatigue hidden behind a smile. There was an icy jug of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz in his right hand. With his left hand he would grip my waist - I was always cooking dinner - and press the cold frostiness of the jug against my arm as he kissed my cheek. I would jump, mostly to gratify him after a time, and smile lovingly at him. He was a good man, a wonderful husband who always brought the milk on Friday, Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz.<br /><br />Then there was that Friday, the terrible Friday that would ruin every Friday for the rest of my life. The door opened, but there was no bouyant greeting - no cold jug against the back of my arm. There was no Tuscan Whole Milk in his right hand, nor his left. There came no kiss. I watched as he sat down in a kitchen chair to remove his shoes. He wore no fatigue, but also no smile. I didn't speak, but turned back to the beans I had been stirring. I stirred until most of their little shrivelled skins floated to the surface of the cloudy water. Something was wrong, but it was vague wrongness that no amount of hard thought could  give shape to.<br /><br />Over dinner that night I casually inserted,"What happened to the milk?"<br /><br />"Oh,"he smiled sheepishly, glancing aside,"I guess I forgot today."<br /><br />That was when I knew. He was tired of this life with me, tired of bringing home the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. He was probably shoveling funds into a secret bank account, looking at apartments in town, casting furtive glances at cashiers and secretaries and waitresses. That's when I knew it was over. Some time later he moved in with a cashier from the Food Mart down the street. And me? Well, I've gone soy.

review/summary: Chateau du Lait Blanc, watch out!
review/text: One should not be intimidated by Tuscan Whole Milk. Nor should one prejudge, despite the fact that Tuscan is non-vintage and comes in such large containers. Do not be fooled: this is not a jug milk. I always find it important to taste milk using high-quality stemware -- this is milk deserving of something better than a Flintstones plastic tumbler.  One should pour just a small dollop and swirl it in the glass -- note the coating and look for clots or discoloration. And the color -- it should be opaque, and very, very white. Now, immerse your nose in the glass and take a whiff. Tuscan transports you instantly to scenic hill towns in central Italy (is that Montepulciano I detect?) --- there is the loamy clay, the green grass of summer days, the towering cypress.  And those gentle hints of Italian flowers -- wild orchids, sunflowers, poppies. Then, one takes in the thick liquid and lets it roll across and under the tongue -- what is that? perhaps a hint of a nutty Edam cheese?  With Tuscan, you feel the love of every dairyperson involved -- from the somewhat sad and deranged farmhand shovelling steaming cowpies to the bored union milk maiden dreaming of leaving this soul crushing life behind for a job waiting tables for obnoxious American tourists in Siena.  But not too fast -- sip gently, slowly, or one is in danger of not only missing the subtleties of the milk's texture and its terroir, but -- if chilled too long -- also of giving oneself a blinding ice cream headache. Nay, savor the goodness that only dairymen and dairywomen working at the apex of their craft can deliver. Tuscan is best drunk young -- no, no, don't cellar this gem -- I guarantee you'll be sorry if you do.  I recommend pairing with freshly baked macadamia nut scones. Milk Expectorator gives this one a 92.

I asked.<br />"Because, if you have more than three ounces of a liquid you could use it to blow up the plane," he said.<br />I was astonished. I had no idea that Tuscan Whole Milk was so powerful.<br />"May I drink it now?" I asked.<br />"Yes," he said, "liquids are harmless once they are inside of you."<br />I drank the entire gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk that I had purchased on Amazon.com while the people behind me grew increasingly inpatient.<br />It was delicious.<br />I did not blow up.

review/summary: Planned Obsolescence!
review/text: Initial set up of the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz is easy, just unscrew the cap and remove the liner. It has a surprisingly rich set of standalone and integrated food possibilities and the addition of vitamin D was a bonus.<br /><br />However, I find that this product quickly becomes unstable (even without overclocking) to the point that it is no longer usable. At first I tried passive cooling to prevent the degradation, but ultimately had to switch to an active cooling method to prolong the products usefulness.<br /><br />Note that even with this extreme care the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz will still break down. Even if you never use the product it will still fail! This is the worst kind of planned obsolescence, requiring you to replace this product every two weeks whether you use it or not!<br /><br />Pros: Inexpensive, easy set up.<br />Cons: Short product lifecycle. No instruction manual. No optical/coax sound output.

review/text: One of my dogs has a sensitive stomach and was constantly eating grass when she was outside, then she'd come back into the house and throw up.  When I read that this dog food was helpful for dogs with sensitive stomachs, I decided I'd give it a try.  My dog has only thrown up a couple of times since I started her on this food months ago.  Even though it's on the expensive side, it's worth it.  Most specialty dog foods like this are on the expensive side, but it's much better for your pet because it doesn't have all the fillers in it.  My dog has had no problems with her bones, which is a problem with her breed, her coat is healthy and shiny, and her eyes are fine.  My breeder once put it this way to me.  "You can either spend a little extra now on the pet food, or you can spend a lot later at the vet."

Most puppies have sensitive tummies and at first the dry food we started feeding her didn't agree with her at all, detected by loose stools usually. When we tried "Now" our puppy immediately ate and loved this dry dog food plus my daughter and I read the label carefully and noted it is grain free, no animal or grain fillers. Recommend reading the ingredients on other dry foods to compare this one. Now Small Breed Forumula has real de-boned poultry, salmon, natural vegetables & fruits --all nutritious food. Stay away from grain & meat fillers -- they are not a good thing.

The morsels are small and easy for my toothless dog to pick up and eat and there has been no stomach upsets from either dog.  The skin seems to be quite nice and they are sleek and shiny and full of energy.

review/summary: Loved by my 2 chihuahuas
review/text: My two chihuahuas Coco and Louie love this food. Coco our younger even started eating it as a puppy when we had her on soft food, preferring it to the expensive canned food from the specialty store. They both are very healthy and have smooth coats and lots of energy. The kibble is perfectly sized for puppys and adult small dogs alike.

review/summary: Good Food for Small Breeds!
review/text: this food was suggested to us by a gal from "All The Best" pet stores. I would say it ranks well among grain free foods. We wanted to try something different, our 2 year old Yorkie had been on small breed Wellness for awhile. We did a taste test of about 4 foods and this one is the one he kept steering to. He's been on it about 6 months now, seems to love it no problems.<br /><br />Shipped out pretty quickly. Good price!

review/text: My Yorkie liked this food, but it was too expensive. I paid the same price for a small 1 lb bag that I normally pay for a large bag of high quality dog food. But sellers shipped quickly.

review/summary: Wintergreen is my favorite flavor
review/text: Called "Frozen Tongue" this was the second flavored released by ALTOIDS in 1998.<br /><br />ALTOIDS mints were first produced in England at the turn of the 19th century during the reign of King George III.<br /><br />Ingredients: sugar, artificial flavor, gum Arabic, gelatin, corn syrup, natural flavor.<br /><br />My first encounter with wintergreen was in a heat rub (I smelled it but did not eat it.) Then I found it in some circular candy with a hole in the middle. Now I keep a tin of ALTOIDS at work, home and in the car.

review/summary: Great for Tiramisu
review/text: Great product, but don't order it online.  Shipping doesn't keep it cold and it needs to stay refrigerated.  When I received mine it was hot and spoiled. And with shipping it was over $16. Rather buy it at a shop where you walk in and get it for just over $4.

review/summary: Better than Philadelphia Cheese
review/text: Well I tried making Tiramisu with Philadelphia Cream Cheese & it turned out pretty good...... Then I stumbled n2 this brand of cheese by accident..... So to make a very long story short, when finally ate the Tiramisu with this Mascarpone Cheese, oh it tasted much better (perfect). I'll most definitely order this cheese again & Imma see how it turns out in my cheese cakes.

review/summary: Andy Capp hot fries were defective
review/text: The Hot fries that I purchased were of a "second" quality. I had just purchased a case of 12 pack of hot fries about 2 weeks prior. I then ordered the 35 count case from OZBO and I tried them and they were DEFINATELY defective. They were a different look, crunch, they were too salty and they were definately rejected product. I now know why I paid less for the item except now I can't use any of it. What a waste, $35 dollars down the drain.

review/summary: My version of crack
review/text: I don't know what Nature Valley has done. They have made a product that I have no self-control over. I will literally have three bars in one sitting and then have to punish myself by taking an extra trip to the gym for cardio. I am amazed of how delicious a granola type bar could possibly taste. It is the perfect balance of sweet and salty, and the buttery, maple-ish coating is to die for. Everyone I know loves them and I have greed issues when people ask me for one. I like to hide them and deny I eat them in fear of an intervention!!

review/text: These are right at the same price as I pay for the other flavors in the store so that is fair.  However, as I have yet to see the Cashew flavor in any store it makes this a great deal.  They are quite tasty and well worth trying.

review/summary: Really Good and healthy!
review/text: These are really good. If you like cashews, you'll really love the balance of cashews and granola.  The sweet side of the bar, offers just enough sweetness to satisfy your sweet tooth.  I ordered another box before I completed the first one, because I did'nt want to run out. The subscribe and save feature is great because it allows you to get them regularly and save money on shipping.

review/summary: what cashews?
review/text: I disagree with the others that this is a cashew flavor it really is just sweet and chewy. If you want Cashew flavor try Mrs. Mays snacks.<br />I do love the Nature Valley pecan and peanut bars though.<br />Try Caribou chewy granola bars especially if you like choc and coffee flavors. I'm addicted.

review/text: These have good cashew flavor, but not nearly enough nuts. The Nature Valley Sweet & Salty Peanut bar counterparts have many more nuts. If you are a nut freak, go for the peanut bars, but if you love the flavor of cashews, these are the bars for you.
