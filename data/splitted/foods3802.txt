review/summary: Tasty, Healthy Alternative...
review/text: Like a lot of people these days I am trying to eat better.  I pretty much have it down as far as recipes for a healthy breakfast through dinner.  Snacking between meals has always been my true downfall.  No matter what it is we do for a living it seems we are relentlessly bombarded with the sight and display of candy bars and other gooey concoctions wailing their sirens song wherever we venture too. (I happen to work at home but believe me, that doesn't help). I first picked up some of these Quaker bars at the local market here.  At first they didn't set too well with me.  Considering they were following the act of a snickers bar or peanut butter cup.  Trust me when I tell you however that you do get used to them rather quickly and they are not all that bad.  The main thing I enjoy about them is their chewy consistency over a lot of other dry crunchy cereal bars.  The moist chewiness is a real crowd please when it comes to fooling you into thinking that you're eating something downright decadent.  And for something that is good for you, they have a real taste to them that is most pleasing.  Especially if accompanied by a nice cup of coffee or tea.  I eat one usually around lunch, after dinner, and later in the evening anytime I get the munchies while watching TV or working.  (Which is just about all the time).<br /><br />Amazon can sometimes be a little scarce on their nutritional info, so please, allow me.  These bars are low in just about everything that is bad for you, (and unfortunately makes real candy bars taste so good).  A single bar contains about a 100 calories, (not the 90 advertised, not according to the nutritional info supplied anyhow), 3 grams of fat, (1.5 saturated), 75 grams of sodium, and 18 grams of carbs.  They are just about half of any so called protein bar in all the right places as far as bad stuff, and even lower than fiber bars as well.  These cereal bars may not be as tasty as some of the other alternatives as far as health bars are concerned, but they are certainly both less fattening and a lot cheaper than the tastier alternatives as well.  If you buy a couple of boxes at once here on Amazon, the shipping is only like a dollar more and a real bargain.  I highly recommend these bars if you want to eat healthier and are not all that fussy about the taste of what is better for you.  Enjoy one or two with a cup of coffee or a glass a milk and they make a tasty, better alternative to junk food you will come to look forward too...

I have been looking for something to put over my brown rice that doesn't take a lot of work when I am away from home. I like Curry but it is usually too hot for me, so I tried Patak's Original "Mild Curry Cooking Sauce". It works great! If you like Sweet Sauces and you like Mild Curry sauces, this is a combination of both.

review/summary: Heavenly!
review/text: This is heavenly in espresso! One pump of this sugar-free dark chocolate syrup and my mornings are now sweeter without sugar or artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />I hesitated to buy this because of a previous experience with a different brand, but I shouldn't have worried. The Amoretti's has a wonderful dark chocolate flavor to it with a touch of sweetness, though not heavily so.<br /><br />Note that Amoretti's customer service is also splendid. I wasn't sure what they meant when they said no artificial sweeteners, concerned that there might be sweeteners called 'natural' (but that really aren't). They called me and let me know the good news - no sweeteners of any kind. Apparently, their (Amoretti's) extract process allows some sweetness through, but they add none.<br /><br />There are a few calories (15) and carbs (4g) per serving, but so worth it.<br /><br />The cost may seem a bit high compared to other syrups, but not only is this of the highest quality, a pump is included.<br /><br />Let me repeat myself - so worth it!

review/summary: Peculiar aftertaste
review/text: In my search for a decent sugar-free syrup, I bought six of Amoretti's sugar free syrups including this one, to try on my coffee.  I'd say this Dark Choco and Amaretto are probably the best of the Amorettis I've tried, but they are still, gross.  It says "All Natural Flavors," but when I tried it, there was this unpleasant aftertaste and smell that began after about 5 seconds and lingered for minutes, just like the other Amorettis.  It's hard to describe the aftertaste, but it is similar to "cough syrup."<br /><br />I searched the bottle to see what they used, but there was nothing on the bottle.  I searched the web, and there is nothing.  Apparently, this peculiar aftertaste is a trade secret. I wonder what kind of "natural" preservative was used.<br /><br />The syrup is also very "watery" in consistency, and not "syrupy."<br /><br />To be fair, my wife says it is decent, but for me, these are totally gross.  There is just nothing like a real sugared syrup.  Anything else is still a dream.

review/summary: SOURED ON THIS CHOICE !!
review/text: The case arrived with the pieces mostly broken and the confectioner's sugar "dusting" all moist, gummy and barely coating the cookies (most of the coating had fallen off). They looked gross, so they ended up NOT being served to guests as a light dessert. Some tasted stale even though they were (barely) in date. The lemon flavor is quite unnatural and the pieces of hard lemon candy baked into these "shortbreads" contributed to this very unnatural flavor. Not a plesant experience and I actually ended up tossing them after tasting the first few boxes. The fact that the shortbreads were broken--very few were whole cookies--added to the disappointment of this purchase. I can't recommend them for these reasons and won't purchase again.

review/summary: It's key-lime-time!
review/text: If you're looking for something to serve at your next afternoon tea, you've just found it! These cookies are premium key-lime pie in finger-food form. The texture is light and slightly crunchy, with a moderately sweet and somewhat tart key-lime flavor. They're truly sinful and addictive. For this reason, buy these only if you intend to share, lest you'll find yourself devouring the entire box in one place.

review/summary: Really Delicious. I Love the Smokehouse Flavor!
review/text: I've had "Blue Diamond' almonds on many occasions, of course. It's a rather famous brand. But all my sampling was fron small bags or smallish cans. This time I was in a Costco Warehouse Store and they had a big display of 38-ounce plastic jars of Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds. How could I refuse? These things are really delicious. My goodness! And I love that Smokehouse Flavor. I have to limit myself to a certain portion or I'll consume a half jar at a sitting. About the only thing I don't care for is that they seem a bit salty. I love the flavor, but I worry about taking in that much salt. In any case, watching the portions will also be a way of watching the salt intake.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Amaizing Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds
review/text: These are one of the best snacks on the planet. The only thing that even comes close is Slim Jims. I used to get two small foil packs of these out of a vending machine, and a can of Pepsi for lunch every day when I was going through post grad school, and they never got old.<br />The smoke flavor isn't too strong nor so subtle that you can't detect it. They have a perfect amount of crunch, and just the right amount of salt as well. Wash them down with a Pepsi, (or Coke if you prefer) and it doesn't get any better.<br /><br />Why someone gave these a one star review due to the price is beyond me. You rate the  product here, not the price. But people also sue McDonald's for their coffee being hot, so what do you expect?<br /><br />If you've never had these give them a shot. You won't regret it.

review/text: Another great item for those on a low-carb diet. Transitioning from "regular" food to low-carb can be very difficult for those who like to snack. Blue Diamond makes fantastic flavored almonds that help with the cravings you get. I was missing being able to eat chips and salty snacks. These almonds absolutely hit the spot!<br /><br />They are smoky yet salty. In no time I was addicted to the flavor. It only takes a handful of these to curb your craving, but they're so good you'll want to keep eating them. The tub is a great deal once you find yourself running to the store for more!

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis.

These almonds are also a bit too salty for my taste, but I tend to like sweet things more.  I will certainly finish this container, but then I'm going back to the cinnamon/brown sugar variety.  They are more expensive, but I like them more.

review/summary: "Health Beef Broth without unhealthy additives"
review/text: Health Valley Beef Flavored Broth No Salt Added, Fat Free is a healthy versatile product. Anyone can use it no matter what kind of diet plan they are on. Just add whatever type of seasoning you like to whatever recipe you are using the broth in, like onion powder, garlic (not me), or a low salt all purpose seasoning product (we use Old Bay).<br /><br />My wife uses it to make no fat gravy for mashed potatoes and it tastes great. She also uses it to make Au Jus dip that is not excessively laden with sodium (we use lite salt) and it tasted good without raising my blood pressure.<br /><br />Unfortunately, so many products like this are loaded with sodium and or fat, or things like MSG and or garlic which can give me a migraine headache. This product is perfect for me because it has none of these things so we can season it to suit our needs.<br /><br />Local stores no longer sell the Beef flavor so thank you Amazon.com.

review/summary: Great choice for a low-salt, low-fat diet
review/text: Much of the flavor of traditional broths (canned or homemade) is from fat and salt, so don't expect this to have the same richness.  But for anyone on a diet restricted in sodium or fat (or both, in my case), this product is a nice find. It adds both body and taste to many dishes I cook.  The only sodium is from the meat itself, so a whole can has fewer than 200 mg, about 1/10 the amount found in most canned broths.  There's no fat at all, so a can adds fewer than 30 calories to your receipe.  Again, without the fat and salt it can't be as yummy as "Mom's" was, but it's pretty darned good and I recommend it to anyone challenged with cooking tasty food without much sodium or fat.

review/summary: The cats love this stuff!
review/text: I have four cats, two of which have pretty sensitive stomachs, and all four of them love these foil pouch meals. I feed these to the cats as special treats. Their regular diet consists of Science Diet dry sensitive stomach formula, which they all tolerate well and enjoy, but they love this stuff. I have purchased other brands of the foil pouch meals and either they won't eat it, or if they do, ultimately end up throwing up somewhere in the house. The cats go nuts when I open the cupboard and pull a couple of pouches out. I use two pouches to feed the four cats and since this is their treat, and not their regular food, I can afford to add this to their diet. They like this much better than the canned Friskies.

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are for one of the flavors: turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. Another flavor was: water sufficient for processing, chicken, and liver. At least there is turkey and/or chicken in it, but other than that its mostly nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Some Friskies flavors are even worse than the ones I listed and contain no real meat. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: I have two cats who literally love these pouches!!  My cats have gotten into the habit of getting a pouch (between the two of them) in the morning for breakfast and one pouch between the two in the evening when I come home from work. On the weekends when I don't work and want to sleep in... my female cat will come wake me up and won't stop talking (meowing) until she is fed. After I make their plates... she shuts up... lol and leaves me alone. If you don't feed them, my female cat won't leave you alone or be quiet and will follow you around the house until she gets her wet food. It's the funniest thing to watch yet annoying at times ;)  but yeah don't expect to be left alone if they aren't fed their daily pouch. I guess it really must be that good! lol I would definitely recommend these to any cat owners... it helps bring variety and change to their dry cereal which they have on a regular basis and they seem to LOVE them. Plus by having them automatically shipped to you on a regular basis you get free shipping and save a few bucks... can't beat that!

review/text: ...the humans, not so much. We bought a few boxes for a petsitter's use, thinking that pouches would be more convenient than canned. In fact, we found them to be much less convenient. About a third of the time, the top tab doesn't tear all the way off as it should, thence getting in the way and dripping gravy all over the place. A significant portion of the food stays at the bottom of the pouch after dispensing, requiring scooping out with a spoon - also a messy endeavor. All flavors have lots of gravy, which the cats love, but makes me feel as though I'm paying for a lot of water. We've happily switched back to Trader Joes' canned catfood, which the cats really like; is a good quality product; and is more reasonably priced - with the added advantage of having recyclable packaging.

The six flavor package is great because it mixes up his dinner selection over the course of the week.

review/summary: Toothless cat loves it
review/text: Our cat, an elderly fellow missing most of his teeth, isn't too picky.  He still enjoys his kibble, which is usually Atta-Cat from Costco, but he LOVES gravy so I subscribed to get a case of this every month.  The pouches are faster and easier to open than a can, and I like being able to give him a variety of flavors.  He seems to get most excited about the beef and the turkey.  After some experimenting, I now give him one of these Friskies pouches in the morning along with some kibble, and just kibble at night.  He typically eats 100% of the gravy and 70-90% of the chunks.  There's a lot of gravy in the pouch so make sure you squeeze it all out.  Good to the last drop!

review/summary: Best cat food for your cat
review/text: My cat has always eaten indoor formula dry food. I didn't even think she'd like wet food. When she started putting on some pounds, I did some research and found out dry food is *horrible* for your pets. It dehydrates them, can contain bacteria, and is super high in carbs/low in animal protein. Upon further research, I came across a site that detailed hundreds of wet cat food flavors/brands and listed what percentage of calories comes from protein/fat/carbs. This brand was one of the FEW (a dozen or less) that actually had the healthiest calorie percentage ratio (at least 50% calories from protein, no more than 40% calories from fat, and no more than 10% calories from carbs). I've been buying it ever since! And Amazon Subscribe & Save offers an awesome price.

review/summary: My Cats Also Like This But I'm Not Crazy About Packaging
review/text: The cats like this food (actually the older cat gives me the "This is acceptable, peasant" look when I give her a pouch) and I haven't had any trouble with kitty upset stomach.  BUT, I don't really care for the pouch it comes in.  It's hard to get all of the food out of the pouch and into the bowl.  I keep a couple of boxes around in case I run out of the cans but only buy it if it is on sale.<br /><br />I also feel a bit guilty because my recycler doesn't want the pouches.  The cans they are happy to take.

review/summary: Love those Friskies
review/text: My kitties are inveterately spoiled and eat Fancy Feast High Quality food four bowls a day (They share leftovers with Ferals). In the past I had used Friskies for another Kitty who has gone over the RainBow Bridge and he liked this fine, but newer kitties seemed a bit prissier. I found a packet of the Turkey one night and gave it to Miss Priss to have as an extra at lunch because she was bugging me to eat. Guess what, she likes these Friskies just as well as her Fancy Feast. I was thrilled and a bit relieved. The Friskies tend to be less expensive than Fancy Feast. So now, I have Amazon send me a case on a regularly rotating basis. (With gas being rumored to go as high as $4.75 a gallon, it only makes sense to order from Amazon on Prime.) Now Miss Priss and Mr. Not So Prissy are happy all the time with plenty of Friskies on hand. The Ferals are thrilled with it too and since it is so reasonable, they get a treat every few days.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJARMI">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, 3 Flavor Variety Pack (Salmon, Mixed Grill, Turkey & Giblets), 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084EJO">Friskies Classic Pate Variety Pack # 2 Canned Cat Food (24/5.5-oz cans)</a>

review/text: I bought these with subscribe and save and my cats like the variety of flavors and I like that it's seemingly less packaging than cans. However, after about 6 months they started getting bored with it so I had to start switching it up with another brand of wet food that I also got through subscribe and save and it's actually cheaper. So I'm buying that more often and putting these on the less frequent shipment timeframe.

review/text: I gave this product two stars because of the convenience of having pouches instead of cans to deal with several times a day. It looks and smells fine to me.  We have two adult spayed female indoor cats and also feed and shelter an outdoor feral female (spayed, of course).  While they lick the gravy off the food, they really don't seem to enjoy it and most of the time there are plenty of leftovers in their dishes to toss away.

review/text: The heading of this review is pretty much the gist of it. My cats would come running for this stuff, but pretty much they would just lick all the gravy up and leave most of the food. I will say that they tended to eat the seared fillets more than the fine cuts.<br />I rated it 3 stars because it seems to be an average cat food. Some cats will like it, some won't. I'd recommend buying a few loose pouches from your local grocer first to see if your like it before buying the 24 pack.

review/summary: Not as Good as Whiskas TenderBits
review/text: I purchased this variety pack because the Whiskas Tenderbits variety box was not available anymore under Subscribe & Save. With the Friskies, I have to add a small amount of dry food to the pouch because it is more gravy than food and my poor cat thinks he is starving to death already! I initially set up a Subscribe & Save for the Friskies but after trying it I cancelled. It is just not worth it for us. I was able to find boxes of the Whiskas at a local pet store so I stocked up there. I would assume that if you have used to the Whiskas with Gravy (instead of sauce) it might not be much different but Tenderbits has less sauce. Hope this helps!

review/summary: The cats were happy campers
review/text: We don't normally buy the packets of Little Friskies, but since our cats<br />have been not eating quite as much lately, we wanted to get some packets<br />of food for less waste than a full can.<br /><br />Amazon had a great deal on the box of packets, so it was a good time to try them.<br />(Our local stores do carry them, but I don't get out very often these days.)<br /><br />So far, both cats like the food. They love the canned Friskies, but wasn't sure if<br />they'd like the packets.  So far so good.  Like all packet foods, there is a higher<br />water content, but while it is a little annoying to essentially be paying for extra<br />water, it is still good for the puddytats. They can always use more hydration.<br /><br />The food itself was made with cats in mind, for sure. I say that, because some cat<br />foods look like they were made for dogs with a flavor adjustment for cats! Honking big<br />bites, strange bits, etc.  The Friskies packets have very nice small bite-sized<br />bits of food, which both cats seem to enjoy. Even when feeding them Friskies from<br />the can, there is normally a lot of food on the floor when they are done - they pull<br />out bigger pieces onto the floor to work on them, or they just get messy. So far,<br />the Friskies packets are small enough bites that neither cat is pulling the food<br />out of the dish to eat it.<br /><br />The only other thing I would say about them is that they seem to have a little less<br />actual food in them than some other packets we've tried. By that, I mean that splitting<br />one packet between the cats is normally 1 meal for them both. (They eat a couple times a day.)<br />With Friskies, it sometimes takes a packet each to satisfy them. Not sure if they just like<br />the food better (always a possibility), or if there is just a little less than the amount<br />in some other food packets. By that, I mean food volume, not weight. Water obviously makes<br />up a higher percentage of the weight in these packets, so looking at the packet weight alone<br />is not a good indicator of actual food quantity.<br /><br />Either way, they are happy, the quality seems okay, so that makes us happy.<br /><br />UPDATE Jan 9, 2012:<br />We are still buying these, because our cats still love them.<br />My only real complaint is that Purina is a genius at marketing...  in wanting to reduce the<br />amount of food in each packet without seeming cheap, they added more water to make the weight<br />similar. Since the water will make gravy no matter what if there is other food in there, they<br />called it "Gravy Sensations" like it was a well-thought-out plan to make cats happy.<br />So, you get a lot less food and a lot more gravy in them since the changeover (you have the older<br />version if you have the black and white cat on the boxes, the new version if you have the ginger<br />tabby on the boxes).<br /><br />But, I'll still buy them, but I really watch the price, as I know I am buying<br />mostly flavored water. However, I have not changed foods, as this is often the only way<br />to get our girl kitty cat to get enough liquids in her. Just be aware of the high amount<br />of water in these packets.<br /><br />By the way - if you run hot water over the packet for a few minutes, it helps to warm up the<br />food and unstick the pieces of food from the bottom of the packets. It also makes it a little<br />nicer for the cats (at least I'd like to think so!).

review/summary: Great Kibble!
review/text: I got my kittens from two different breeders both of whom were feeding RC Babycat and various other RC formulas for their sires and queens. I transitioned my kittens from Babycat to Kitten 36 very easily. Currently, they are close to one year old and I've gone ahead and begun the two way equal mix of RC Kitten 36 and RC Adult 27 for transitioning. So far, my experience with the 3 RC formulas have been excellent. I have an issue with the Adult formula kibble size but that's another review for another time.<br /><br />My kittens love the taste of Kitten 36. We free feed dry by choice and my kittens love to munch on this kibble! Price is outrageous, but I pay it. One of the large box pet stores (5 letters in the name) has a very good customer program. After I signed up and told the system what kind of cat food I buy, I began getting coupons for RC cat food. Up to $3 off a bag, buy 4 cans get 1 free, etc. I'm taking one star off for price.<br /><br />From my vet I learned RC caters to breeders with 'breed specific' formulas and just about every other targeted need from nuts to bolts. I don't know if breeders are getting kick backs or not. I'm embarrased to ask those breeders I know but really, I have no complaints. I believe RC spends alot of money on R&D and are truly interested in the health of our cats. Having said this, from my readings and poking around in the cat food world, there are other dry foods I might be interested in introducing. I plan on doing that using the new kibble as a treat rather than a meal.

review/summary: Worked for Dental Health
review/text: My kitties were eating another premium dry food and were very healthy EXCEPT that one of them had bad breath.  The vet recommended Royal Canin, saying that it promotes dental health not just by virtue of being a dry food, but due to one of its "active" ingredients, which she referred to as an enzyme.  I bought a small bag and transitioned the kitties to it.  Within a week they were eating this full-time, and I'm happy to say that the bad breath is gone.  I assume bad breath is not just a cosmetic issue but an indicator of gum and tooth problems so I'm glad that I was able to deal with it while kitty's adult teeth are coming in.  On Cats 101 I learned that there are cat breeds that are susceptible to gingivitis, so I plan to continue to use Royal Canin adult dry food when they move into adulthood.

review/summary: great as treats too for my raw fed kitty
review/text: The cattery I got my Savannah cat from had been using and recommended Royal Canin Kitten 36; I  transitioned my little guy to a raw diet fairly early at 13 weeks but I continue to use this food occasionally as a treat for him.<br /><br />He always comes running when he hears the storage container open. I feed him just a scant couple of tablespoons in any given day, and always separate from his other food. Even though he is raw fed, this does not cause any negative digestive issues for him.<br /><br />He can be somewhat picky at times so I am impressed that he enjoys this food so much.

review/summary: buyer beware
review/text: I bought this cat food as per the breeders recommendation with out checking out the history of the food.<br />My sweet kitten started throwing up this food,i checked every aspect of my kittens heath and changed his food<br />and he was find , no longer vomiting. he had been eating it since he could eat dry food and then,I think something in it buids up in his system and then every day and night about 30 mins after he eats he becomes sick. He was still playfull and I was not about to wait until he became really ill. I've stopped giving him this food and he's hasn't been sick since so buyer beware,this company was part of the recall in 2008.

review/summary: Weber Chicago Steak Seasoning - 8.0 oz.
review/text: I have purchased many items through Amazon and have always been happy with Amazon......until now.  The Weber Chicago Steak Seasoning I purchased for $25.99 had written specifications of "Quanity 2", but received only "1" 8.0 oz. container.  Even if I received the 2 as specified, it was overpriced, as Sam's Club has the same 8.0 oz. container for $5.38, therefore 2 would be only $10.76.  Not only did I receive 1 container instead of 2, I also paid $20.61 more than I would have paid at Sam's Club.  It's my mistake for not researching, but items on Amazon are usually competively priced.  I learned a lesson with this purchase!<br /><br />If you have an interest in this seasoning (it is very good) do not buy it through Amazon.

review/summary: My favorite seasoning ever!
review/text: This is not competitively priced on Amazon. I was hoping I could start purchasing this online, but I guess not. I do have to say this is the best seasoning I have ever bought. I love it on chicken, it gives it a great flavor!  I also use it on steak, I bought the Weber Chicago Steak seasoning, but actually like this one better on steaks. The grinder can be adjusted for a finer or coarser texture, which is awesome! The sodium content is horrible (65mg per � tsp).  So overall I definitely recommend this product, but it may be worth shopping around for the best price.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sea salt, dehydrated onion, spices, sweet red pepper flakes, dehydrated red bell pepper, dehydrated orange peel, dehydrated garlic, sugar, disodium inosinate and guanylate, extractives of paprika (color), spice extractives and natural flavors

review/summary: Fantastic cinnamon oil
review/text: I use this oil to make cinnamon tea.  Everybody loves it.  I give everyone the recipe, but they say it doesn't taste as good as mine.  I said that it had to be the cinnamon oil.  However, I can't find it any more.  I used to buy it at Albertson's, but they've gone out of business by and large.  Help!!!!
