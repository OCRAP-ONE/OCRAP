review/text: great products to try if just wanting something on the go versus carrying fresh fruit. Portions are small for the price- yet we expected so given the product being dried fruit.<br />Liked the products, wouldn't buy again just due to high cost for amount you get.

review/summary: The best quality organic snack, with nothing added!
review/text: I love these snacks! They are so moist, full of flavor, fiber and no additional sugar or preservatives. Our kids love them too. We have to make sure to keep enough, otherwise they fight over them.<br />Ideal snack to take to the movies,trips, and any place we go.<br />This is a real "feel good" snack. We appreciate that's gluten free.

review/summary: Some good, some bad, some ugly
review/text: The pineapple is amazing!!!  The mango is pretty good - it's hit or miss though, some pieces are fantastic and some are tasteless and kinda taste like a foot.  The banana was disgusting to us and neither myself nor my husband could eat it...  And honestly, I can't bring myself to have the apricot because it looks so gross through the package window.  The apple is pretty good though.<br />Sooooo five packs - one amazing, one good, one pretty good, one disgusting and one so ugly that I can't even open the pack.  LOL<br />I'd likely just purchase the pineapple and mango again.  For the apple, I MUCH rather prefer the "bare fruit" (I think that's what it's called) brand.

review/text: I really liked all of them with them being soft that was one of my favorite things about them, besides the flavors. My kids really seemed to eat these much easier and faster. Plus, the names are quit funny as well. I also really like that on the back of each bag there is a see through window that lets you look at the product inside. Another great thing I have to mention is the bags are resealable so that way your snack will stay fresh. My favorite flavor was the mango which I really liked.

review/text: I have been buying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001942GAI">Brothers-ALL-Natural Variety Pack Crisps (Fuji Apple, Asian Pear, Strawberry/Banana),  2 - 12-Count  Bags</a> for quite some time and have really enjoyed them, as have my grandchildren.  I thought this brand of fruit snacks would give us some different fruits to try.  The first one I tried was the mango.  It was okay.  Chewier than I would have liked, but the flavor was acceptable.  then I tried the banana.  It was bad.  I threw it away.  This makes me reluctant to try the other flavors.  I guess I just like the ones that are crispy rather than chewy.  I think the crispy ones are easier for the little ones to eat as well.  Both come in a package that is a good size to take along.

review/summary: Best chewing gum on the planet
review/text: All mainstream sugar-free gums contain aspartame.  I don't like that.  Most sugar-free gums either don't taste very good, lose their flavor very quickly, or disintegrate after 10 minutes of chewing.  Zylicious tastes great, keeps its flavor long, and I've never experienced it disintegrating even a little bit.  Plus with that Xylitol, it's brushing my teeth when I can't.

review/summary: Versatile!
review/text: They were a lot bigger than the restaurant pot stickers I'm used to, so it was a pleasant surprise there. The taste of the filling was good compared to the local Chinese place with just the right amount of pork and seasoning. The sauce was VERY sweet and might not be for everyone, but a bit of soy sauce or wine vinegar would mild it out nicely.<br /><br />I made it in three ways:<br /><br />First, I tried as recommended by microwave, then a quick fry in a oiled pan. This method produced (as you would expect) a tender wonton wrapper with the slightly fried texture on both sides, and it brought out the filling flavor the best out of the three methods. Pretty good.<br /><br />Secondly, I threw one package (4 to a package, 5 packages to a container) worth into the stove and cooked for about 15 minutes. This produced a crisper crust  but was my least favorite out of the three.<br /><br />Thirdly, I deep fried them in peanut oil. The wonton got very crisp and flaky and that texture combined with the filling was my favorite out of the three. This method wasn't recommended on the package, but it should be!<br /><br />Overall these went very well with my meals and once as a snack, I plan to get them again!

The mixers are festive and it's GREAT to not be getting all that sugar! (My 10 year old likes to drink them as an alternative to soft drinks! He doesn't know that they're mixers. A LOT less sugar than other kid's drinks!) I highly, HIGHLY recomend them! Please buy lots so we can keep these folks in business!

review/text: I have been gluten free for over two years and have gotten quite used to gluten free snacks having their own "special" taste somewhat like cardboard with the gritty after mouth feel to remind you that they are healthy.  LOL.  These pretzels are even better than I remember "normal" pretzels to be.  My husband who is not gluten free constantly steals my stash.  I do not live in the US and have to go through a complicated process to get them as AMAZON only delivers these to US mainland addresses. They are worth every bit of the expense and complications as they are really really fantastic.

They're crunchy, but light (not rock-hard on the teeth like some pretzels can be).

review/summary: The BEST GF pretzels available
review/text: We have tried MANY GF snacks and these are our families favorites. Most brands of GF pretzels are hard and flavorless. Not these! Light, crisp and yummy, we tear through them at our house!<br /><br />My 3 year old and I are the GF members of our household, but everyone loves them! My 11 year old generally thinks all things GF are "ick" by default, but she inhales these. Many of my kids friends say they are the best pretzels they have had, and they have no idea they are GF.<br /><br />We mix them with Rice Chex (GF but not other types of Chex or generic brands), raw almonds and chocilate chips for a yummy snack mix we call "Finnie Mix" - named for my 3 year old. Good stuff!<br /><br />We also grind them with raw almonds and use them as a fabulous breading for chicken nuggets.<br /><br />They are a bit pricey, but well worth it. The subscription offer from Amazon is a great deal (about $2-3 less per bag than any of the stores in my area) if you want to drop $60ish bucks at once.

review/summary: Glutino pretzel sticks are great!
review/text: I regularly buy the Glutino pretzel sticks for my family. We had been missing pretzel sticks after going on the gluten free diet and were so happy to find these. They taste really great, almost like their wheat counterparts. Each of the many bags we've eaten has always been fresh and crunchy - never stale. A bag of these pretzels doesn't last very long in our house.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8FQ">Glutino Sans Gluten Free Pretzels, 2.6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 20)</a><br />I purchased this product primarily because of the reviews...and I scorded. These Gluten free pretzels taste great. They're light, taste just like regular pretzels, and have just the right amount of sea salt. I was a bit concerned when I read the sodium content, but figured I could just brush the extra salt off...no need. Both of my finicky kids love them, & I've even shared them at outtings with other children & adults who had no clue that these pretzels were gluten free. I would definitely order them again.

Many times the  gluten free products I try are not even a good imitation of the real thing. This is not the case with these pretzels. I took them to my office and let everyone try them. I had a hard time keeping everyone away after one taste!<br /><br />One serious word of caution--They are so good you will find yourself eating more than you should!

review/text: These are the best pretzels we've ever eaten, and by far the best tasting gluten free product.  My family loves these, and it's only my son who has to eat gluten free.  It's nice to be able to give my son something that I don't feel like is a lesser product taste-wise than the "regular" version.  So glad to be able to buy them by the case since they are hard to find in stores.  The pretzel sticks seem to taste better than the traditional shaped pretzels--don't know why--could be mental on my part.

review/text: My nephew is a picky eater. He would only eat cheddar goldfish. Recently, he was put on a gluten free diet and we were worried that we wouldn't be able to satisfy his cravings for something crunchy but gluten free. We started experimenting with all kinds of snacks and he hated pretty much everything. When he tried these pretzels, he wouldn't put them down. He won't even share!! They are delicious and he doesn't even ask for the goldfish anymore.

review/summary: Great deal on best GF pretzels I've found!
review/text: I fell in love with Glutino stick pretzels when I started a gluten-free diet six months ago. I actually think they taste better than the regular pretzels I used to eat! The only downside was the price -- the local store charged $8.99 per 14 ounce bag. When I checked on Amazon, I was pleased to find they carry Glutino pretzels. Interestingly, the 8 ounce bags turn out to be a better price per ounce than the 14 ounce ones, so that's what I ordered. With the subscribe and save deal, the 8-ounce bags came out at just over $3 apiece. If you or your gluten-free child loves pretzels for a snack, and you have the space to store a dozen bags, this is an awesome deal! I have a handful of friends who also are gluten-free, so I've shared some of my order with them. These are amazingly good pretzels and Amazon's subscribe and save price is the best you're going to find anywhere!!

review/summary: Get these if need a POWERFUL LAXATIVE
review/text: I purchased these at a local store, and had half a bag for lunch.  They tasted OK, but were definitely not worth the after effects.  Within about 7 hours after eating these my stomach started feeling awkward.  Shortly after I started having cramps and severe watery diarrhea several times throughout the evening and late night.  Looking at the ingredients, the thing that stands out is carboxymethylcellulose AKA cellulose gum.  The package I purchased said cellulose gum on the ingredients list, but on the web sites it is listed as carboxymethylcellulose.  You will find they are synonyms if you Google them.  All I had for breakfast that day was a bowl of dry corn flakes, and didn't have time to eat dinner before my stomach started cramping.  If you look up this ingredient, or look it up along with "side effects" you will find it is undigestible and can cause side effects such as bloating and diarrhea.  Never again.  All I can say is please post a review if this happened to you to others are forewarned!

review/text: I bought these pretzels for my dad, who suffers from Celiac disease and Type 1 diabetes. He has a hard time keeping any weight on due his restricted diet, and often resorts to potato chips for his sole source of carbs between meals. He absolutely loves these pretzels, and said he enjoys them more than the regular kinds. I think they taste excellent, with that very slight "burnt" flavor that makes pretzels so good. They also seem to have a delicious buttery aftertaste IMO. Plus, they're very satisfying and healthier than potato chips.

review/text: I love these pretzels.  They are just hard to find.  I think pretzels have too much salt on them and I am always trying to scratch off the salt with my finger nails or a knife or something.  Even if I wasn't trying to watch my salt intake I try to take the salt off because they just put too much salt on pretzels.  These pretzels are really very good tasting.  I was afraid because they are gluten free they wouldn't taste very good because a lot of the gluten free products you sacrifice taste.  But not with these.  These are very close to regular pretzels and I am so glad they come in salt free.  I buy them by the case.

review/text: These taste as good as "normal" wheat based pretzels - we discovered them locally at a health food store, but the price was crazy high.  Much cheaper on line.<br />But buyer beware - 12 packages of these come in a big box !

review/summary: Thank you Glutino
review/text: Was pleasantly surprised how delicious these pretzels are and there is no odd aftertaste as with some gluten free products.  Perfect for munching and the pretzel sticks stay fresh in the bag for quite a while, that is if you can resist finishing the bag.  Would purchase again.

review/summary: Tastes Just Like Regular Pretzels!
review/text: We had been eating the Glutino regular pretzels for a few years now and they were okay, but recently our health food store started carrying these.  I bought a bag and we enjoyed them so much I was back buying a few more.  Pretzels are one thing I've missed since going gf - but not any more!  Taste great with dip, too!

review/text: I'd never heard of Glutino before. I bought a snack pack of these pretzels at a health food store. They cost a fortune. I was shocked when Amazon had them by the case. What a great find for my son on the GFCF diet. They taste great. No different than other pretzels. We bought a whole case. We love them! Thanks so much Glutino.

review/summary: Potato-y taste, bad texture
review/text: In my opinion these are a poor substitute for a "real" pretzel. They have a potato-y taste and an odd texture. They're crunchy when you first bite into them. Then they quickly dissolve; not very quickly, just more quickly than "real" pretzels.<br /><br />So far Snyder's gluten free pretzels are the closest thing to "real" pretzels I have tried yet. I just wish they were made in twists.

review/text: These pretzels have been a wonderful treat since discovering I am gluten sensitive, but at 6 grams of fat a serving you need to be careful of how many you eat!  Would rate them at five stars if they contained less fat, but then they might not be as yummy...

review/summary: Glutino Gluten Free Pretzels
review/text: If you Celiac or just perfer gluton-free, these pretzels are a good substitution for both other pretzels and other types of snacks. Despite what O'Reilly used as a tip at the end of his show, gluten-free usually mean more "carbs" for a similar serving.<br /> But as a Celiac, varity is truly the spice of life. Celiacs first response to diagnosis is to see all the walls between them and what used to be their favorite foods. Celiacs in this day and age are so much luckier than previous generations. Firstly, because Doctors are running the proper blood tests to diagnosis gluten-intolerance much more frequently. It might appear as if more folks are stricken with this these days, but I am convinced that is just because of this increased knowlegde by the Doctors.<br /> As to these pretzels. They may or may not strike you as better than your previous favorite, but you now understand that the previous favorite were the cause of "palor", malnutrision and gastro issues. So you must resign yourself to exploring the every expanding gluten-free offerings.<br /> These are not your Philly soft pretzels, but they make a great salty and crunchy "chip" with which to scoop up some hummus, peanutbutter, etc.<br /> Also, this size bag and the Amazon price for a box of these every month or two is one of the most affordable ways to enjoy these healthful snacks. They also good straight from the bag, but it easy to get carried away.<br /> My wife and I found out about my Celiac 5 years ago. It makes you read everylabel on every product you bring into your house. You may even go as far a throwing out all porous (i.e. wooden) utensils, your old toaster and several other things and can't be guaranteed sanitazied.<br /> You learn to trust mostly the food you make yourself, but when you learn that you can trust Glutino, and you can, subscribe to Amazon for regularly scheduled deliveries of all types of life giving goodies like the Pamela's Pancake Mix which go great with chopped, toasted walnuts, blueberries and a couple of raisins although, most maple, agava and other syrups are still safe.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8HY">Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists, 14.1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: These are the BEST gluten free pretzels
review/text: My wife and children are gluten intolerant and we searched for good pretzels for a long time. We finally found Glutino a few years ago and then began the quest of buying them at a reasonable price. Amazon S&S is the perfect place to find them at a good price per bag or price per ounce compared to a lot of grocery stores.<br /><br />These pretzels are so good I usually don't buy regular pretzels anymore and just eat a couple of these when I want to eat pretzels.<br /><br />If I had to make any negative comment it would be that they could probably use a little more salt.

review/summary: Wonderful Treat - Better Than Non-Gluten Pretzels
review/text: Not only is this snack delicious but it's one of the first items to be even better than regular pretzels that have wheat.  The recipe produces a light and very crispy pretzel, doesn't get stale after leaving it a month in ziploc like other pretzels.  Everyone that I've shared with agrees with me.  So it is very expensive though for those who cannot eat gluten, it's a must have.  I buy it by the case and sparingly share with others!

review/summary: better than "regular"!!!
review/text: These pretzels taste great! I am lucky that I am *not* gluten intolerant but for health reasons I'm trying to limit my gluten intake. This means I can choose snacks from either side of the fence so to speak. I think that these Glutino GF pretzels taste better than most "regular" pretzels. Less salty than most non GF pretzels too which I think helps bring out their better flavor.<br /><br />These tend to be a little messy - the sesame seeds fall off quite a bit - not so much they aren't on the pretzel but enough that a couple of teaspoons wind up in the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />The only quibble is cost; these are usually more expensive than another equally good choice of GF pretzel that I enjoy - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047IG6OU">Snyder's of Hanover Gluten Free All Natural Pretzel Sticks 8-oz, 12 pack</a>.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and highly recommended.
