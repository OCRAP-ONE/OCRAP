review/summary: Bumblebee chunk white albacore is DISGUSTING!
review/text: The last two times I bought this variety (at a local BJ's, not through Amazon), rather than chunks, the cans contained what I would call shredded tuna (if it IS all tuna!). I couldn't even drain the cans by pressing on the top, as I usually used to do - the semi-solid stuff inside kept running out along with the liquid it was packed in! When I resorted to pouring it in a strainer, the water STILL didn't drain - it was just one big mushy blob. I finally Googled "Bumblebee chunk white albacore tuna" and found out that a LOT of people had the same types of complaints. Yeah - I know - I should have learned after the FIRST time I got it at BJ's - but I try to give folks the benefit of the doubt. However, after this, I will never again buy this stuff, and urge others not to waste their money on it either!

review/summary: just what was needed
review/text: Christmas Stollen has been a tradition in our family for 30 years - recently my mother and father passed away - My sister and I wanted to keep the tradition alive - unfortunately - the Christmas chore of obtaining the Stollen had always been my father's task. I live in Minnesota and all my family lived in Washington, DC - I looked online and inquired around locally - the best I found was the Kuchenmeister Marzipan Christmas Stollen.<br /><br />My Sister and I were able to keep our family tradition going through our first Christmas without our parents. The occasion was poignant,  both happy and sad; full of remembrances. The stollen was the highlight of our Christmas morning. Keeping a happy holiday remembrance fresh and joyful in our hearts.<br /><br />We'll be customers for life...

review/summary: Absolutely delicious, but...
review/text: My mom has made Christmas Stollen since my childhood in Bavaria. Then, a number of years ago, she happened upon the Kuchen Meister Edel-Marzipanstollen at Trader Joe's. That was the year she gave up making stollen because she came to the conclusion that it was almost as good as hers, but at about $3.50 per loaf, there was no way she was going to spend hours in the kitchen making the authentic stollen. If this review were simply about taste, I would have given it five stars and ended here.<br /><br />There are two problems with this stollen that caused me to knock off a star for each:<br /><br />1) Production consistency. My family consumes about a dozen of these each year for the Christmas Season. The difference in the amount of marzipan from one stollen to the next varies greatly. They average a decent amount, consitent with the picture on the box, but I often have some that are overloaded and some that have no marzipan at all. Better consistency would be nice.<br /><br />2) Ingredients. My family and I try (whenever possible) to be health conscious. I enjoyed this stollen more before I read the ingredients. With ingredients like hydrogenated vegetable fat, sorbitol, and artificial stollen flavor, I'm just not enjoying it as much as I used to. If I'm going to consume saturated fats, then I'd at least like to see them come from a natural source, like butter, not some artificially hydrogentated fat.<br /><br />The bottom line on this stollen is it tastes great, but it's pretty bad for you. I haven't made stollen since my mom passed away a few years ago, but next year I'll probably start again. Until then, this one is good too.

review/summary: A GREAT GF, Dairy free, Casien free alternative!
review/text: This is a great product for those who need gluten, dairy & casein free foods.<br /><br />Of course it doesn't taste like REAL macaroni and cheese! Geez - do you really think you can get fake cheese or non-cheese to taste like the real thing?!? If you're looking for something to replicate real cheese or annies GF mac and cheese (which DOES contain dairy) then you will search in vain. You cannot get real cheese flavor from non-cheese products.<br /><br />However, if you're realistic and are aware that non cheese stuff won't actually taste like cheese yet you want something similar to mac & cheese then this is a great option! We really like this mix and the other roads end products. It has a unique flavorful taste. We tend to alternate this stuff <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXG8W">Namaste Foods, Gluten Free Say Cheez Pasta Dish, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> The Road's end is closer to cheese than the Namaste but again, those who want a real cheese flavor/consistency will be sorely disappointed. However, for those of us who cannot have real cheese this stuff is great.<br /><br />We mix in veggies with ours (you know the ones that are little squares of carrots, peas, corn, etc.) and I use hemp milk when mixing for a bit more substance and flavor. Also if you add a bit of trocomare <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLBSO">A. Vogel Trocomare, 3.2 Ounce Units (Pack of 4)</a> it makes a huge difference in flavor (actually trocomare makes a huge difference in the flavor of everything! We love it and use it on just about everything.<br /><br />So - for those who expect a real cheese flavor - don't even bother and stick with real cheese or change your expectations.<br /><br />For those who realize it won't taste like real cheese but who want something different and unique (and gluten, dairy, casein free) - buy this, it's great!!!

review/summary: Good for Vegan Mac
review/text: Let me start by saying I'm not a vegan, I'm vegetarian. But recently I've been trying to incorporate mostly vegan foods into my diet (maybe someday soon I'll be full vegan)... and so I picked up a box of this at the store.<br /><br />I went into it knowing that it would not be exactly like mac and cheese, and I think that made all the difference.<br /><br />I tweaked the recipe and I think it helped lots:<br /><br />Boil the water then add the macaroni (we used the shapes version) and about a cup of frozen broccoli. Cook until macaroni is desired softness.<br /><br />While mac is boiling, shred up some of your favorite vegan cheese. Mine is Daiya, but this time I had Follow Your Heat Cheddar in the fridge, so I used about 1/4 cup of that. Put the vegan cheese in a bowl along with 1-2 tablespoons vegan butter (I used earth balance). Add just a splash of olive oil. Microwave for about 30 seconds (or cook on the stove top) until the cheese is liquid.<br /><br />Strain pasta/broccoli mix.<br /><br />While pasta is draining, make the sauce in the pan over heat on the stove. I used 1/4 water, 1/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk, and a spoonful of vegan butter. Add powder to the pot, then milk/water, then butter, and finally your cheese mixture from earlier. Whisk together (with a whisk) while heating. STIR CONTINUOUSLY! This will get rid of the clumps and makes for a thick, creamy sauce. You might actually need more liquid depending on how thick you like the sauce.<br /><br />Add cheddar/broccoli and stir. Salt to taste.<br /><br />I added sriracha to mine!<br /><br />Turned out pretty good. Is it Kraft? No, absolutely not. But it is a good pasta!

review/summary: Can't place the flavor
review/text: I have been opening all the little drawers in my mind to try to find the memory of this taste but have struck out. I think it's the faint hint of curry but it really doesn't belong here. I agree that the "pasta" isn't bad but it isn't the best GF I've ever had, either. However, the "sauce" (if you can call it that) IS gritty and unappealing. I know it isn't supposed to be a gourmet dish but I feel I wasted the money I spent on it.

review/summary: It's kind of a hit or miss
review/text: Back when my son was first diagnosed with Celiac disease, he was supposed spend 6 months abstaining from all milk products while his gut healed.  I like making my meals from scratch when I can - although I do have plenty of evenings where I need something that is quick and easy.  I was so happy when I found this product.<br /><br />The food itself is very easy to prepare and the serving sizes are adequate.  The consistency of the noodles is great.  They're not too mushy, chalky, grainy, etc.  The cheese alternative however is really odd tasting.  I know that there's really no such thing as a decent cheese alternative, so I wasn't expecting this to taste anything like cheese.  It tastes okay at first, but the aftertaste is REALLY bitter.  It doesn't taste like anything I've ever tried before.  (I don't mean that in a good way.)<br /><br />That being said, my son kind of liked it.  It wasn't a replacement for regular macaroni and cheese - but he always ate it without complaint.  Strangely enough, my daughter absolutely loved it and she's the pickiest eater I know.  I pretended to enjoy it so my kids wouldn't decide to stop eating it - but my husband couldn't stomach it.<br /><br />All in all - I don't think that this is going to help if you're craving Kraft mac & cheese.  (That's true of nearly all dairy free cheese alternatives though.)  However, if you happen to like the flavor of this - it's a wonderfully fast gf/cf meal that can be eaten alone or dressed up.

review/summary: Sauce leaves more to be desired
review/text: Pros:<br />Gluten Free<br />Dairy Free<br />Vegan<br />Organic<br />VERY reasonable sodium content for a processed food (310 mg of sodium per 300 calorie portion)<br />The rice pasta is very good<br />The rice pasta is made of brown rice (much healthier than white rice)<br />High protein (8 g), high fiber (8 g), reasonable iron (10%) and high B12 (30%). Nutrients that are usually lacking in vegan products are very high in this one.<br />Only 3 g of fat per 300 calorie portion.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The sauce didn't have a very strong flavor (was somewhat bland) and it had a very grainy texture. I think the sauce could be improved if it contained more spices and the spices were more finely ground.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of Alfredo - when I grabbed this box all I saw was that it was Vegan, Organic and Macaroni! Something I had not yet been able to find. So it is possible that I dislike the sauce because I'm not a huge Alfredo fan.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this pasta to someone who avoids gluten or animal products (the rice pasta is probably the best rice pasta I've had!). I'm going to give their traditional macaroni and cheese a shot.

review/text: This product is actually very good.  My daughter, age 11 and on a GF/CF and soy protein free diet, loves this!  She was a big mac & cheese eater before we learned of her allergies.  So, that has been something shes really missed.  This is quick and easy to make and good reheated (she'll take it with her to a friends or to grandma's).  I can even make this as a side dish for the whole family - I just add a little salt & pepper and those who can have parmesan cheese add it.  Sometimes, I add cooked/diced chicken - that is very good!

I was so excited when I found this dairy free product and after I read the ingredients (brown rice flour, organic garlic, organic onion, basil, etc.), it sound pretty good. WRONG!

review/text: Hill's Science Diet Puppy Small & Toy Breed dog food provides precisely balanced nutrition to meet your small breed dog's special needs.It is the only brand with an exclusive blend of clinically proven antioxidants.This formula is specially designed to boost immune defenses and support the long life expectancy of small and toy breed dogs.<br />There a myths that allergies are caused by ingredients such as corn but that is not the case. To say that something is a filler would imply it has no nutritional value; when in fact corn is a superb source of nutrients. There is a misconception that whole corn is used - in fact the corn is baked and is much like ground corn you buy. When cooked it is highly digestible.We hear many concerns about by-products in pet food. We need to understand how they are defined and what they really are and what is their nutrient value.<br />By-products is really a play on words. Virtually all ingredients in pet foods are by-products. No one for example uses real chicken breasts as we know it.It's neck and backs of a chicken.<br />Another common myth is that meat should always be the first ingredient, inferring that if that was the case, there would be more meat than anything else in the food. Often the carbohydrates levels are higher than the meats because of the way they are listed in the ingredient panel.Meat first is often the first ingredient only to please the consumer look st the ash levels and mositure levels, and ingreident spliting.<br /><br />I have fed Science Diet to my two dogs and I am very happy with the results. They love the food, it seems to have a good nutrient profile, my dogs have not had any gas or loose stool, in fact the clean up has been minimal so far, poop is much smaller and less of it that ever! I keep searching the yard with the scooper several times a day and there just isn't much to clean up! I can honestly say that they are going HALF as much as they were before! I never would have believed it, considering that there is a considerable amount of corn in these formulas.<br />My dogs were itching, had greasy coats and dandruff all at the same time! I was frustrated and worried for them...after a relatively short time, one of the dogs has virtually stopped itching and the other has decreased her itching intensity.<br /><br />I do wish the food was less expensive.

review/text: I received my first bag via a coupon from BzzAgent, for free... since price was not a factor I was more than open to seeing positive changes. I really wanted to give this a high rating because our little mutt really seemed to like eating it and it is the perfect size but I did not notice any positive changes in her. By the same token, I did not notice any major negative changes either. However, the first few days she had diarrhea and after that it went back to almost normal consistency but she was pooping about twice as often. She was also thirsty all the time while eating this.<br /><br />I would say this food is average in quality, the pooch liked the taste but did not experience any of the claimed improvements so I do not think the price is justified. Others may have better luck with it but it just did not work better than our old food.

review/summary: Served in Fine Establishments and My Home
review/text: I first tried this tea at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC because they were out of the African Amber which I'd just finished drinking.  Not wanting caffeine, my choices were limited and I am so glad I gave this a whirl.  In the past, although I drink chamomile, I've recently relegated my chamomile teas to use in the bath tub for a soak.  My taste buds had confused the steeped tea with the aroma of dirty socks.  Drinking the Mighty Leaf Tea Chamomile Citrus exposed me to a combination of flavors which are much better consumed and I had to buy some for my household.  I only add milk to my Irish or English breakfast teas and I seldom add lemon.  On occasion, I may add a Splenda.  I add nothing at all to this tea other than just boiled water and I do not discard the teabag after brewing the first cup if I've brewed it directly into a cup.  I use the single bag for two mugs worth of tea and enjoy the second cup as much as the first.  The "silken" bags have a white cotton string attached to a little paper tag and they are machine stitched for security.  The fabric allows for full steepage and easy cleanup.  Although the fabric will not biodegrade as quickly as paper, it is lovely to touch and look at, so I try to not feel too guilty by using these bags.  I really like the combination of ingredients with the chamomile, particularly the nana (mint) and am impressed by all the Mighty Leaf Teas I've tried.

review/text: I first had this at a fancy schmancy restaurant in San Francisco. It was an excellent conclusion to a lovely lunch. The flavor manages to be slightly sweet and citrusy...like baby aspirin. It is lovely iced with cut up lemons and oranges in it. I often give it as gifts to tea lovers. It is the tea most of my tea drinking friends request when visiting our home. We have reordered several times. Unless you are buying in bulk directly from the manufacturer, Amazon has the best price. it runs about $9.50 at the 'natural' food store. Our local big chain grocery stores do not carry it.

I drink at least one cup every day. I'll let it brew and add some honey. Usually I let it cool down and it is great to the taste and great for you!

review/summary: Sweet Dreams from Amazon and Mighty Leaf Chamomile Citrus Tea
review/text: This Mighty Leaf Tea, Chamomile Citrus, has the most pleasing, smooth, mild flavor.  This is my choice prior to retiring for the night.  I've read somewhere that having a cup of Chamomile Tea prior to bed is as soothing as having a cup of warm milk.  It does relax the body and mind for a restful night.

review/text: I first tried this tea at a Mercedes Benz dealership and I was hooked.  I have tried many different types of herbal teas in the past and Mighty Leaf tea is one of the best tasting teas (in my opinion -very flavorful).  Chamomile Citrus tea is my favorite, it's a really hard brand to find at the grocery store and even specialty tea shops.  I finally found a 15 bag box for 14.99.  It is a bit expensive but well worth it.  Amazon sells the tea for a well worth it price as well.  I highly recommend this product/brand.

review/text: I love Chamomile tea, and I become so disappointed in trying tea after tea only to find it bland and stale-tasting. Chamomile has such a lovely, delicate flavor, and most packaged teas just don't do the beautiful flavor justice. The Citrus Chamomile from Might Leaf is hands-down the best Chamomile tea I've ever had. The citrus flavor is light and perfectly complements the subtle chamomile flavor. The tea is so smooth (like all Mighty Leaf teas) and perfectly balanced. My favorite tea to relax after a hard day and go to bed!!

review/text: I love Mighty Leaf teas. I originally tried Mighty leaf at a quaint little coffee shop; I fell in love with the shop and the tea. The Chamomile citrus is unlike other chamomile teas I have had in the past, and there have been many. The slightly sweet taste with just more than a hint of citrus is very relaxing. A perfect cup steeps for about 5 minutes, add a drop of honey, sip, relax, and sleep like a baby.<br />If you like this one, Try the organic mint, especially iced.<br />The only downfall is that I cannot find Mighty leaf in local stores, but Amazon's price is good and worth every cent.

If you leave the tea bag in all the time, you will notice the bitter tea flavor (not saying it is a bad thing).

review/text: I love chamomile and being sensitive to caffeine its the perfect tea for me. This is my review on  Tazo Calm vs Mighty Leaf Chamomile Citrus. ML's underlying taste is orange, making the tea a bit tart.  Tazo has a hint of mint and lemon making it the perfect combination. The price: ML's box comes at $8.99 vs Tazo at $5.99.  They're both not organic so the price makes a big difference, I definately recommend the Tazo Calm over Mighty Leaf Chamomile Citrus.

review/summary: Better than Starbucks!
review/text: If you're looking for a homemade alternative to Starbucks green tea frappicino, this may be perfect for you!  The only part of Starbucks green tea frap that I really disliked was the melon syrup.  This is like the base WITHOUT the melon flavoring, so it was perfect for me!<br />I used 200 cc of almond milk (50 calories) with one packet of the mix (160 calories) and poured it all into popsicle molds.  It made 4 1/2 popsicles (of around 1/4 c each), to make really nice green tea frap pops!  Each pop came out to be 46 calories, so it really helped with portion size, so I wasn't drinking a huge drink loaded with calories, but still got the nice, frozen green tea treat!<br />My ONLY complaint is that it could have a *little* more green tea powder.  As is, it's probably about as strong as the Starbucks version.  You can definitely taste the green tea -- it is sweet and grassy.  If you have any pure matcha powder around, adding a little extra would give that added kick.<br />Obviously, this is a treat, and even though it is green tea, it's not exactly "healthy".  It uses non-dairy creamer (fine with me since I'm not a milk drinker) and also has added artificial coloring.  I only mention this in case someone is looking to eliminate those things from their diet.<br />Also, check around your local Asian market for this product.  I found it for only $4.50 for the same sized package, so it was much cheaper buying than buying it online!

review/summary: Good Value
review/text: Good value for the money.  Are they the highest quality olives, no, but they are tasty and great for cooking.  The main thing about these is that you are buying in bulk, so there is not the level of "selectiveness" of the olives to give a consistent grade.  Some are absolutely perfect and great for eating raw. others are a bit mushy, and some have blemishes you probably want to cut away.<br />However, for just over $4 a lb, these are fantastic.  When I opened the tin, I immediately placed them into 3 rubbermaid containers.  One I hand sorted out the best olives for raw eating and placing out at parties.  The rest will be fantastic for cooking.  Size of them I would say to be medium.<br />One thing however, don't leave the tin on your counter or in the refrigerator, it stains.  So remover all the olives and toss the can into the recycle bin.

On its own, it made me gag.  Mixing it with lentils and a lot of other spices, I was able to get it down.

review/text: Father was a huge fan of fig preserves and fig jam. Grandmother would pick figs from her trees and we all anxiously waited for a jar of her best to arrive. Being old fashioned, she still poured wax on top of the goodies within as extra precaution to the canning process. This Ziyad Fig Jam was no disappointment. I bought a jar for a nurse friend and she could not be happier. If you are looking to expand the variety in jams at your house or to relive pleasant moments in the past when you were helping your grandmother with the canning, this product does quite well.

review/summary: Darned good for a packaged cookie
review/text: Unlike some of the other reviewers here, our packages of cookies arrived intact, sometimes even overly packaged in that unique-to-Amazon way.  Once we got the cookie packages out of the huge outer box, pushing aside all the bags of air, and then grabbing the inner box (what would be shipped to a supermarket), we found that we had some darned tasty cookies.  Real chocolate chips and a generous amount per cookie, enough to say that it would be tough to take a bite of cokie without getting a chip.  The batter holding things together was good, without nuts or any strong flavoring that would keep it from overpowering the taste of the chocolate.  Nicely crunchy,  as is normal for box cookies.  No one will ever mistake these for homemade, but they are pretty good for packaged cookies.

review/summary: One of the best tasting packaged cookies out there
review/text: I usually hate the taste of prepackaged cookies but these were amazingly yummy. I got the chocolate lovers cookies and they were LOADED with chocolate chips and chunks. In my opinion these easily rivaled store bought unbaked cookie dough cookies once they've been baked and cooled when it came to taste and texture. I loved them and will be buying them on a regular basis.<br /><br />The Keebler elves really got their act together with these cookies. These are WAY better than Chips Ahoy by a long shot.

review/summary: Great Tasting
review/text: Since this seems to be a main concern, I thought I would start with saying that all packages of cookies arrived intact along with a lot of other items I had ordered. Now on to the cookies themselves, they are very good tasting cookies. These taste like real chocolate chip cookies that crumble in your mouth and chocolate in every bite. The flavoring is great for packaged cookie. Yes, I would rather have a cookie home baked and out of the oven. But I will buy these again. I would recommend them for when you just don't feel like baking. For its price, it is the best chocolate chip cookie so far I have had shipped to the house.

review/summary: Chocolate Chip Coconut Cookies not so yummy - but Amazon was great!
review/text: I finally found my most favorite cookies through a dealer on Amazon.  After waiting nearly 4 weeks for them to arrive I finally contacted Amazon to let them know that I still had not received the cookies I ordered.  Two days later the cookies arrived - where they went before reaching me is still a mystery.  But I was happy to finally have them as I can't get them in Southern California.  The minimum order was 4 packages and that was okay, I would freeze some for later.  Much to my dismay the supplier just put the four bags of cookies and a box with NO packing to protect them.  So you guessed it....almost all of the cookies were broken into crumbs:  And to top it off the cookies "best if eaten by date" was only 2 days after I received them!  Needless to say these must have been sitting in a warehouse for quite some time.  After contacting Amazon I was able to get a refund for my crushed cookies.  Oh well, maybe I will try again by ordering with Amazon through a different vendor. Thank you Amazon - you were great.

review/summary: Superior to Chips Ahoy!
review/text: I used to buy Chips Ahoy! brand cookies at the store once in a while because they were my favorite cookie from childhood. It had been years since I even tried a Keebler brand cookie and one day I found them on sale. I found that Keebler Chips Deluxe originals are thicker, fresher, more crumbly (although very few if any were broken in the package), and overall much more melt-in-your-mouth delicious than Chips Ahoy! originals which were thinner, a little harder, and almost a bit stale-tasting. If I remember correctly, the Chips Deluxe cookies package has 2 ounces more in it. I've never been a fan of the soft batch.

review/text: The "Soft 'n Chewy" Chips Deluxe cookies are highly underrated. Often overshadowed by Chips Ahoy's Chewy Cookies in marketing and sales, "Soft 'n Chewy" cookies from Chips Deluxe are worth trying if you enjoy cookies that are, well, soft and chewy. I would say these are just as delicious as Chewy Chips Ahoy cookies, but they are also thicker and usually cheaper. Pick one up today and the people in the house with sweet tooths will gobble them up quickly.

review/summary: 1 gram of trans-fat per 16 grams of cookie!
review/text: As of Nov 2007, the Keebler website says that each 16 gram serving contains 1 gram of trans fat!<br /><br />Don't take my word for it that this is terrible, because here are some quotations from the survey article<br /><br />Mozaffarian et al "Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,"<br />The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354,<br />pages 1601-1613 (2006).<br /><br />Here are a few quotations from this article:<br /><br />"given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD ["coronary heart disease"] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. "heart attacks"] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted."<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />"The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed."<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />"On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm."<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook "nutritional epidemiology", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book "Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."

review/text: Agree with the first reviewer, these are quality peaches.<br /><br />So many uses for these peaches, such as on cereal, as dessert, in blender drinks, and in salads, or just out of the can.<br /><br />The price , delivered to the doorstep by Amazon, is very helpful.<br />  Finding 12 cans of peaches in pear juice locally would be a challenge, and fresh peaches are  only here in summertime.<br /> So these peaches are really great, and very welcome.<br /><br /> /I tried mixing these into protein powder, like a smoothie.  You get helpful emergency food with a taste very close to the fruit pies your grandmother knew how to make.<br /><br /> 15-ounce can has 3 1/2 servings of:  peaches, water, pear juice concentrate,  only 5 milligrams sodium per half-cup serving.  So, plan to keep on hand for emergency and daily enjoyment, we plan to get a case to back us up in power outages,  Enjoy.

Delicious right out of the can, made into a fruit smoothy, or below a quick recipe that was a big hit for me.<br /><br />I was looking for a quick and easy desert and here it is:<br /><br />DRUNKEN FRUIT<br /><br />Place slice with some of the juice in a bowl. Add brandy, port, or rum to cover (the mixture of juice to spirits depends on your own preference), with some sugar syrup and spices in a bowl. Place the bowl in the fridge, let it steep for a day or two and you'll end up with a delicious syrup. Put it on pound cake and other desserts or use it as an ice-cream topper.<br /><br />This was so easy and got rave reviews!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Peachy keen
review/text: Really! These are great tasting canned, sliced fruit which are as good or better than I get at my local supermarket without the hassle of lugging them home. I bought three cases (2 peaches, 1 pears) which arrived at my doorstep astoundingly fast, considering that they were shipped about a thousand miles to me by truck, I assume.  And there was no damage to the cans whatsoever.<br /><br />The expiration dates for the peaches and pears respectively were december/2013 and december/2014. One reason I bought these items was that it is difficult to find virtually any food product at the supermarket that has low/no sugar. These, in pear juice, were the closest I could get. Pricewise, they were comparable and I bought enough in dollars to get Amazon's free shipping deal.<br /><br />I may be buying more of my bulk groceries through Amazon. There is no guarantee you will have the same happy shipping experience I did, but it's worth trying. You can spend your time in more enjoyable ways that hauling heavy items home from the grocery store. That's the value of these, to me.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED.

review/text: Great space-saver and organizer. We have been ordering coffee from Amazon in the 50-packs for a while and we normally just have a couple of boxes sitting on the microwave. This only adds about 2" to our Keurig but it stores 30 cups. We truly love it. My only complaint, and it is a small one, is that the shelf does not have a sliding rail or wheels or anything. It just slides out metal on metal. This can make for some terrible sounds as well as making the product feel a tad bit cheap.

review/text: I learned to love these bars when my children lived near to the manufacturer.  Now that they no longer live there we order on line instead but what a treat!  And healthy for the active young adults as well as for my grandchildren, ages 2 1/2.

review/summary: Good Gravy!
review/text: Realy enjoyed it as I live overseas and there is no Waffle house or Dennys to get a good biscuit and gravy. This works and is so easy to use. Heat and eat - my favorite type of 'cooking'!

review/summary: Excellent Product.
review/text: Packed with sausage and creamy smooth gravy this product rivals the homemade variety any day. I found it to be a very consistent blend throughout and not one bit thin or overly thick as some others have noted. The chunks of sausage are quite large (and very tasty) considering this is a canned gravy. Best if enjoyed over biscuits right out of the oven. Though I can see this being good on just about anything people wanted to fix along with it. Chicken or fried eggs or the hundreds of other items I've seen gravy used for.<br /><br />One small con is the lack of spice (a bit more pepper would be nice). Though that's an easy fix. But overall it's an excellent product that satisfied this gravy lover and the other members of his family. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Update (04/22/12): Have now gone through 4 cans of the gravy and like it even more than I did originally. The consistency I find from can to can is in stark contrast to the claim of some the previous reviewers on this site. Am happy to report that I will be trying it over some fried chicken fritters (from Omaha Steaks) later today. I'll update after.

review/summary: Nasty
review/text: I bought some of this stuff at my local grocery store recently, hoping that I could save myself the trouble of making my own from scratch. Compared to the stuff I make, this was just nasty. For some reason, it tasted strongly of nutmeg (or at least of what I *hope* was nutmeg--God only knows what they put in this stuff.)<br /><br />Anyway, you can make your own country gravy from scratch without too much difficulty and it's way better than this. I'd take a pass if I were you.

review/summary: Real Bad Stuff
review/text: This sausage gravy is by far the worse sausage gravy that I have ever had. It tasted like paste,and there was very little sausage in it.

review/summary: campbells sausage gravy
review/text: Great product, super taste, plenty of sausage. The only problem is NO QUALITY CONTROL AT CAMPBELLS sometimes the product is nice and thick out of the can, so thick in fact it needs to be scraped out of the can, other times it is as runny as soup. Thicker is better.
