review/text: I fell in the love with the flavor of Mrs. Miller's Homemade Blueberry Jam at breakfast at a friends.When I found out the name of this jam I bought it for myself.<br /><br />It has a pure and old fashioned taste to it, not all corn syrup and sweeteners.<br /><br />From now on this will be the blueberry jam on my breakfast table.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Easy Now tea is great!
review/text: I put 1-2 teabags of Easy Now in an entire teapot let it steep for 20-30 min and have some before bed. No matter when I got to sleep, I always wake up 7-8 hours later, feeling good, and without having woken up in the middle of the night. (except maybe to use the restroom, but I always fall back asleep instantly) Its also great anytime during the day to just calm your nerves, it won't make you sleepy. This is easily my favorite calming tea.

review/summary: Great Product for Making Root Beer
review/text: I'm a home brewer and make wine, beer, and root beer.  I have tried several different extracts for root beer flavoring and this one is simply the best and very easy to use.  I dump the whole bottle into a fermenting/bottling bucket with water (5 gallon total liquid when done), 5 lb sugar, and about 1/2 teaspoon of yeast nutrient and a packet of champagne yeast.  After everything is mixed well I bottle and cap it (makes around 50 12oz bottles) and let it mature for a few weeks in the basement.  The bottling process only takes about an hour (with sanitizing bottles) and I have several folks that have been wild about the end result.

review/summary: Great For Single Servings
review/text: I was looking for a way to avoid the HFCS in soda without giving it up entirely.  Instead of using the home brew method, I make soda using cans of seltzer.  For regular root beer I use 3 TBS of sugar.  For diet I use 1 tsp of Stevita Stevia. I mention the brand only because different stevias vary in sweetness.  I mix a small amount of hot water with the sweetener in a glass until it is dissolved, then add 1/4 tsp of McCormick Root Beer Concentrate.  To that I add a 12 oz can of seltzer and ice.  Tastes great and only takes a few minutes to mix it up. Fast and convenient!  Another favorite of mine is to use 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract instead of the Root Beer Concentrate to make cream soda.

review/text: I tried McCormick Root Beer Concentrate after experimenting with a line of similar products at my local home brewing store. Following the directions offered at the Amazon.com site featuring this product produces a good tasting root beer that is easily created and bottled.  I was glad to find this product, and glad I purchased it; but disturbed to see that the price has jumped from the $35.25 I paid very recently to $52.95 today.  I don't know that I will be back to purchase this product again given this rather remarkable spike in price.

review/summary: the taste matches the price
review/text: I am a tea snob, and I knew the price was way way too good to be true. I was right. The tea is very pale, like it is old or was exposed to light. It is mostly powder and stems, no popped kernels, barely any toasted rice taste, and definitely not the delicate taste that this tea is supposed to have. I literally brewed it for maybe a minute and it was very dark green and just tasted like cheap green tea, not Gen Mai Cha. It is very inexpensive, so I guess you get what you pay for. I have had a metallic taste in my mouth for the past 3 hours since I drank half a cup of it.

review/summary: Great Trout Dinner. Kitties eat it up!!!
review/text: I am currently buying this Trout and Pasta Adult dinner at PetCo. So far, I get there often enough that I just cannot MAKE myself pay $5.99 for shipping for a case of cat food. I still go to PetCo about every 5 months (or 4 if we run out) so that I can pick up the wonderful Pro Plan Kitty Food Flavors that Amazon still has not put on Subscribe and Save. Seems like it would be a no-brainer to me, but then what do I know, I am just the consumer.<br /><br />I LOVE BEING ABLE TO HAVE MY PET FOOD DELIVERED TO MY DOOR. Amazon usually does it for me, but PetCo has also gotten into the shipping business and I see the largest area of conflict here is the one surround the wonderful Flavors of Pro Plan Pet food. You can get them from Amazon, but you have to pay out rageous shipping fees because they are not on S & S yet. Here are some of the flavors I mean and my kitties go into the "to die for mode" when these appear:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TAD0AW">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food, Seafood Stew Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050CWUR4">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food, Turkey and Pasta Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TAD0AC">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food, Chicken, Tuna and Wild Rice Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>and<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050CWTBQ">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food, Beef, Carrots and Rice Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TACZD0">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food, Chicken, Pasta and Spinach Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Yes, they are all AVAILABLE on Amazon but the shipping price ranges from 6 to 8 dollars. Too much. So I still chug off to PetCO, because they always have specials, and new things to look at...then I run home to see if Amazon has them. But if the shipping price is outrageous, back to PetCO. But I have to have two surgeries this summer and running to PetCo may not be an alternative, so I MAY have to pay the shipping for a short time.<br /><br />WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY IS: Amazon get ProPlan wet food on Subscribe and Save!!!! Other than issue, there is no issue. My Kitties especially LOVE this TROUT AND PASTA dish. It is NEVER turned downn and I think that says a LOT. They also really love the others that are listed above on my wish list for S & S for Pro Plan. Those are the flavor I currently trot off to Pet Co to get. My 5 rascals are BIG wet food eaters and inhale 9, 31/2 oz. cans a day. I do look around on Amazon and at PetCo for the 51/2 oz cans. They are usually just a few cents more than the 3 and 1/2 and stretch so much further. Right now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DNXL5U">Halo Spot's Stew Natural Canned Chicken and Beef Recipe Food for Cats, 5-1/2-Ounce,12 pack</a> Spots Stew, the Chicken and Beef, and Lamb are favorites in 5 1'2/  Also, Tiki<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005TKCDOW">Tiki Cat Tahitian Grill Sardine Cutlets - 12 x 2.8 oz</a> also come in a 5 oz can for just a few cents more. Of course, Friskies is the Premier 5 1/2 oz Brand, but mine have been spoiled on Pro Plan too long:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJG2H2">Friskies Cat Food Meaty Bits Variety Pack, 24-Count</a> One of their cans each day will be Friskies, but they have been on the Premium Brands for a long time and without the horrendous shipping, the Pro Plan is still affordable.<br /><br />And, of course, it really is affordable if you are home bound, or totally spoiled by Amazon's delivery system. My kittties beg, purr, whine, flop on their backs, suffer through brushings, and jump in forbidden places JUST TO GET THEIR PRO PLAN TROUT. (and the others noted) So, yes, I definitely, absolutely recommend this. Spoil those babes and keep them healthy. Pro Plan Trout is a  BIG YES!!!

review/text: We tried The Pod Columbia Supremo coffee as our favorite Senseo brand is out-of-stock. We were pleasantly surprised by how smooth tasting this coffee is and plan to buy this brand again. There is far less bite than the Senseo coffee and overall we probably like The Pod Columbia Supremo a bit better. Of course variety is the spice of life, so we will probably drink the Senseo too; but The Pod Columbia Supremo is our current new favorite.<br /><br />Recommend.

review/text: I think Keurig is pushing out Senseo. The grocery stores near me stopped carrying Senseo pods. I went with this order based on the 3 positive reviews. They were right. Great cup of coffee. In fact, I think the coffee is better than what is in the Senseo pods. These pods are a little thicker, IMO, compared to the others but this means I can sneak another half cup of coffee out of the 2 pods. Would definitely reorder these again.

review/summary: Easily the best pod coffee I've tried
review/text: Various pods from different companies either don't fit my Senseo very well or produce indifferent coffee.<br /><br />These pods fit perfectly and brew easily the best cup of coffee of any of the pods I've tried.  Really delicious.  I'll be trying the World Blend from the same company as soon as I get my hands on it.<br /><br />Although I didn't really like the idea of the pods being individually wrapped, which adds to the amount of waste, I think I may be a convert, since the coffee stayed lovely and fresh.<br /><br />Finally, I got an unprompted individual response from the company about my shipping preferences after I left feedback for them on Amazon, which certainly goes above and beyond what I expect.

review/text: Given that the original dark roast from Senseo is no longer available, I tried this brand. Great service, each pod packaged individually, all arrived in perfect shape. Now - the taste: it is NOT as strong as the dark roast from Senseo, but still very pleasant. I'd give 4 stars for my personal taste, however, I knew I was not buying the same coffee, so it'd be unfair to downgrade it. It is still good coffee. I will continue buying it.

review/summary: Very good pancake mix
review/text: While this is not completely whole grain, that is the main component, followed by enriched flour. Most likely if it were completely whole wheat flour the texture of the cooked pancake would be too rough for most to enjoy it. You do get three grams of fiber in this compared to one in Aunt Jemima's Original or Buttermilk mixes, but also a few more calories, since you add milk, egg, and vegetable oil to this mix, and just water to the others.<br /><br />We've used this mix for years, since about the time we replaced white bread with whole wheat bread, and other similar changes to our eating habits. We now find the taste of pancakes made without whole grain flour to be somewhat bland. And we have recent experience to compare to. Like the other 5 star reviewer reported, our local grocery has also stopped stocking this. We got a box of the buttermilk mix to fill in, and it just doesn't do it for us anymore.

review/summary: Good - but not great
review/text: While this makes a decent Root beer, it doesn't quite have that deep flavorful "bite" you would expect out of a natural root beer at this price. Using the recommended mix - it just tastes "thin".  Adding more to compensate and it is just too sweet. My personal preference is more  Sassafras root, and deeper flavor...<br /><br />While it beats the majority of the big brands in flavor -- but it doesn't hold up against the other naturals.

review/summary: Great taste, but should be Amazon Prime available
review/text: Our family loves all the Flavrz concentrates. Our 14-year-old likes the root beer and ginger ale best. Dad's fav is the cola, while mom can't decide between the lemon-lime and tropical flavors. We like that we can control the level of concentration/sweetness. We also like the green-ness of Flavrz: instead of buying huge plastic bottles of icky-flavorded chemical sodas, we buy these small glass bottles-- no plastic toxins, no bad sugars and a low carbon imprint. We mix them with the seltzer we make at home using filtered water. The end result is a tasty treat we feel good about. Highly reccomended. The only negative is the high shipping costs. Really wish these were Amazon Prime available. If they were, we would buy more.

review/summary: WARNING - TERRIBLE PRODUCT - TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
review/text: I ordered direct from flavrz and they lied about shipping the item out in december of 2010, but since the item didn't track at fedex for a week I asked for a refund, but instead of a refund they actually shipped it under a new tracking number and I wasn't at home to refuse the package. I went ahead and tried the cola and root beer and I must say they are awful in taste and it doesn't matter how much syrup you add to the carbonated water, it still tastes like cough syrup. I will never order a flavrz product again and I will go out of my way to warn others about there dishonest business practices.

review/summary: Lovely Lemon Ginger Green Tea
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for over 35 years, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Very tasty and easy!
review/text: I've now tried several of Frontier's soup kits, and I'm pretty impressed.<br /><br />The advantages over cooking from scratch: many of the ingredients and all the seasonings are included, which makes them quite easy to put together. They may need to cook for several hours- I cooked this one for 3+ hours total stovetop- but assembling them is pretty easy.<br /><br />However- be aware that these kits are by no means complete. This one called for- in addition to the kit- 2-3 pounds of stewing beef, 10 cups of beef broth, plus a large onion, several turnips and/or potatoes, fresh mushrooms, and 0.25 cups sherry. (Plus salt and pepper.)<br /><br />However- it did make a HUGE amount of delicious soup (at least the stated 10 servings)! And these kits do not taste like freeze-dried veg, even when they use them a lot. I very much appreciate having the blends of beans, barley, seasoning veg, and spices pre-collected; that makes my life easier.<br /><br />I had some beef stewing meat on hand, so this was an obvious choice. These kits do give one a "homemade" soup- often in large amounts- with pretty easy and clear work. Making soup from scratch would be more thrifty, but quite likely not as flavorful unless one put a LOT more work into it.<br /><br />So: recipes and flavor are excellent. Ease is very good. Thrifty? possibly not so much... but still probably worth it.

We've tried other products but have had limited success and repeatedly been surprised by gooey blobs of purged hairballs.  Since using Whiskas we have not had one cat purge a hairball and I am grateful, truly. I would love it if they would come in bulk, on our first shipment, none of the zip locks on the bags worked.  This second shipment seems better but I'd still rather empty them all into a larger container than deal with the zip lock.

review/text: Since we have been following the package directions that say to feed 10 treats at one time, our cat rarely throws up at all and her stools are plumper. She has always had tiny, hard stools until we started feeding her these treats. We can tell by her stool if she hasn't had a 10 treat dose in a couple of days. She eats these as readily as any other packaged treat we give her. A great find as cleaning up grassy vomit almost every day was getting quite tedious! The auto ship feature is also a big plus. We can't always get these treats here on our island when we need them. Thanks Amazon!

I've taught them to do tricks using these treats because the cats want them so much that if they can figure out what I'm asking, they do it to get the treat!  But they are smart boys.<br /><br />I don't like some other treats because they are as small as kibble.  These are big enough for me to hold between two finger tips while the cats take them.<br /><br />My cats ask for these each night around treat time.  One of my cats eats dry food almost exclusively (no canned food, no meat scraps, etc) and he is often the first to ask for these treats.

We can mix different brands together in a pile, and he will pull the Temptations treats out with his paw and leave the others. Its unreal. Either they just hit the jackpot with the perfect cat-seducing ingredients, or they have some sort of addictive substance in them.... who knows! :) I only give them 4 stars because they are not the "healthiest" treat for a cat, but honestly... he just loves them so much I cant say no.

review/summary: Maybe too good, cats don't want anything else!
review/text: We occasionally feed a couple stray cats as they are good at keeping the mice and snakes away. Once in awhile we will give them some of these Temptations Cat Treats and they are crazy about them! They will only eat the regular cat food if their efforts at getting more of the Temptations Treats doesn't work. One of them will sit at the door and meow and meow but eventually goes and eats the regular food. We have tried all the different varieties of Temptations Treats and they don't have a preference, they like all of them. If you want something to really great to give your cat, try any variety of the Temptations Cat Treats but be prepared for your cat to start begging for these all the time. The one thing we cannot tell is how good nutritionally these are for cats, the package says 100% nutritionally complete but not sure what that means in this case. Even if you could feed a cat these alone, that would be way too expensive so for now I will balance a few treats with regular varieties of dry cat food.

review/summary: Buy At Your Own Risk; Cat Will Choose TREATS Over YOU : )
review/text: Well, here I am, buying my SECOND 12-pack of these treats.<br /><br />My Egyptian Mau is absolutely NUTS over these and has treat time pegged to two 5-minute windows of time each day.<br /><br />These are great hard-coated treats and my cat loves them like no other.  These packs are the same 3 ounce size I used to buy at the grocery store & every one has been fresh and in excellent condition.  Amazon's Subscribe & Save price is much lower than the local stores' prices.<br /><br />You know what they say:  "Dogs Have Owners.  Cats Have Staff."<br /><br />Maybe he needs his own Amazon account?  No, that would be too dangerous.  I can see a garage filled to the brim with cat toys and a house furnished with nothing but cat trees, live birds, and bowls of goldfish...<br /><br />Try these treats; you won't be disappointed (and neither will your cat, which may be most important)!

review/summary: Excellent cat treats
review/text: I've been buying cat treats for many years. Of the brands and types that are still on the market, I find that Whiskas Temptations is the one treat that all cats love. They come in several flavors. My cats like the Hearty Beef and Turkey flavors best. Pricing can be an issue as I have noticed continual price increases in this product for the last few years. Shop around and get them where you find the best price. Currently, the best price is about $1.35 per 3 oz. bag. But I,ve seen them at prices up to around $2 per bag.

review/summary: Cat's are fickel
review/text: My cat's are spoiled, I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there, but probably more spoiled than most.  The price of most cat treats and even some canned food is cheaper than Wally World, especially with a subscription.  These particular treats they love, until they get too many of them and then they want something different.  I tend to have four or five varieties on hand at any given time.  One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.  But they also like other flavors much of the time.  Price is a little more but packages are larger.  One strange thing with Amazon, different flavors of cat treats are different prices, even though they are all Temptations, Friskies, Party Mix, or whatever.

The fine print on the package says that it should not be used on kittens less than 6 months of age.  I didn't notice this until after I bought and opened the package.

Is there really a lot of regulation regarding cat snacks. I doubt it. Ive tried to stop giving them to her but she then turns her back to me and pouts for days to weeks on end. It has taken me a while to figure out what was going on with her and I have narrowed it down to these Temptation snacks. Im concerned about what drugs they put in these.

I've never seen this cat walk around on two legs, try to climb my arm to get to the treat in my hand, or reach into a bag to try to get to the contents before I gave her some of these. The name is very fitting, but the real temptation is for we humans to keep giving just *one* more treat to the cat over and over again to enjoy the fun reactions.

review/summary: My cat goes bananas for Temptations
review/text: I have a very tall, lean, long-legged male cat. He doesn't eat much. I put out the finest wet food and he shows barely any interest. I buy expensive dry food to supplement his main meals. Eh, he could take or leave it. I even tried giving him high-end tuna from a can--the kind people eat--and he hardly nibbled at it. He just doesn't have much of an appetite, or so I thought. When I sprinkle a handful of these treats on a napkin, he furiously eats them all up. When I open the cabinet where I keep them, he comes running from wherever he is in the house. He seems to like all the flavors equally (chicken, beef, salmon - doesn't matter). Temptations is the only food I can count on his eating on a consistent basis. I could never train him or manipulate him with food before because nothing ever motivated him. These treats motivate him. If I need to calm him down for a brushing or a nail trimming, Temptations will work the magic. Thank you, Temptations.

Little did I know this would backfire and they would elicit a desired behavior in ME!<br /><br />Not only do they LOVE these (and a couple of other flavors), they have now learned when it 10pm, which is treat time and time to leave the bedroom.<br /><br />By 930pm the vultures are starting the circle me on bed while staring at me; at 945 they start to softly vocalize; by 10pm they hoist me on their little backs and carry me to the drawer where the treats live while in full complaining voice.  I obey and give them an equal number of treats in the hallway, quickly locking the bedroom door behind me. Why lock it?  We have lever type doorhandles and the male has learned to open the bedroom since "Treat Time" started, will march back in and demand more.<br /><br />Did Dr Frankenstein realized the monster he created?

review/summary: Does wonders for bad breath
review/text: We adopted a neighborhood cat a few months ago. She is very nice, but had horrible breath even after we started feeding her various special cat foods. Otherwise great cat, but when she would yawn in your lap, you had to fight fainting.<br /><br />We took "Dentabites" more for fun since our cat loved other whiskas tempations we tried with her, but well, thought let's try to see if it really can do anything about her breath. After about a week of giving her dentabites, we noticed her breath "improved" and after 2 weeks it was amazing. Her bad breath is almost completely gone, or gone as much as it can without brushing teeth i suppose. We didn't change anything in her diet at the time so we were pretty sure it was dentabites that did the job. Also, since then, we've been feeding her various foods but keep the dentabites snacks and bad breath hasn't returned... one more point to be sure that Dentabites really work.<br /><br />Really great product. Just a few treats a day make enormous difference. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Cats love, I only like...
review/text: Well, there is no denying that Temptations knows exactly what cats like to taste.<br />Much like putting MSG in people treats, they have figured out a combination that makes<br />cats go crazy for their treats.<br /><br />HOWEVER - most Temptations are chock-full of grain fillers that cats do not need and do not eat<br />on their own if they are outside cats.  For that reason, we had stopped buying Temptations entirely,<br />even though it was their favorite. It was like junk potato chips for humans, but we were hurting our<br />cats.<br /><br />When we saw this flavor, we thought we'd give it a try, since they both love catnip. (Not all cats<br />respond to catnip.)  I read the back, and it was not quite as gross as their other flavors, but still<br />something that needs to be occasional only or very limited usage.<br /><br />Both cats really liked these.  They only get a three-star rating from me, because Temptations seems to be<br />too cheap to put decent quality foods in their treats. For a pet food manufacturer, they seem to only<br />focus on the costs, not what the HEALTHY part is for your cats. But, I eat some things that aren't good for<br />me either from time to time, so for a sometimes-treat, this one will do.

One cat cries so loud in the morning it sounds like someone is torturing her.  Eventually, the other cat jumps up on my face to wake me up...for treats.  It's like I'm living in a nightmare if I don't give them their fix.  C'mon...we know big corporations put addictive substances in candy, sodas & chips - - - of course they're in our cat treats.  And, seriously....they've hit the kitty crack jackpot w/ these.  Do yourself & your cat a favor:  Save your mental & your cat's physical HEALTH.
