They are also fantastic to save and use on gingerbread houses at Christmas.  Thanks for the quick shipping and perfect product!

review/text: I've grew the catnip in the past and had never experienced any problems. But this time was different... I've ordered Ferry-Morse Organic Catnip Seeds and planted half of them indoors. Same gardening process as I used in the past. However, the catnip seeds didn't germinate. I've tried again, and still nothing. What a rip off!

review/text: I tried planting these indoors (after my cats decimated the nice crop I had!), but wasn't successful. It was winter, so maybe I overwatered or the sun wasn't quite right. There are so many seed though that I'll try again outside when the weather gets warm.<br /><br />I usually plant lots of seed and let them all sprout up without thinning. My cats come and munch on the little shoots and seem to like that, even curling up in the pot, although that was with different seeds. We'll see what happens with this!

review/text: I first tasted lebkuchen in a coffee shop in Nuremberg, Germany back in college days, and have loved them ever since. At our house, their other name is 'the best cookie in the world.' These rank right up among the very best I've ever had -- they're soft, yet a little chewy, and the bittersweet chocolate coating contrasts nicely with the gingery taste underneath. I have trouble opening a package, then not wanting to eat 'em all! We've gone through one order's worth, and I just ordered two more for the holidays...that's how good they are.

review/summary: It has a bit of a kick more than a slap
review/text: I needed some cajun seasoning for a recipe and as I always do, I went to Amazon.com to see what they had and how was it rated.  After I put in the search and got the results, I think I laughed for 10 minutes just at the name.  And, with a name like "Slap Ya Mama" how could you not buy it.  I liked the name so much, that without even trying it, I bought the 6 pack and gave 4 of them to friends and family.<br />Since receiving "Slap ya mama" I have tried it on chicken, fish, pork, eggs, and mixed vegetables.  Funny thing is I still haven't even made the recipe I bought it for.  Anyway, I recommend that unless you really like hot food, go with the milder version.  I am the only one in my family that absolutely loves this stuff as is so next time I will have to purchase the mild.  The flavor is nice, not too salty in my opinion but that first bite definately bites back.<br />I highly recommend this brand not for the name but for the flavor enhancement it is meant to be.

review/summary: Great for Home Fries & Chicken
review/text: This really spices up home fries and meal breaded chicken. Puts a good zing to soup beans & ham. Have used other products of this ilk, but this seems to be the best so far. It is on the "warm" side, but it isn't as over powering as some of the Latin spices; you can still taste what you're eating without your mouth blistering. I've used it added to beer batter fish fry & it comes out tasty. Pretty much a good spice to keep on the table next to the salt & pepper.

review/summary: Best Jam Ever...ssshhhh, don't tell a soul!
review/text: OK, I'm tired of keeping this secret to myself.  The HERO blackberry preserves is, hands down, the best darn jam I've ever had including my grandmother's pear preserves.  It's sufficiently tart, yet essence of sweet, chunky enough to not be jelly, but not so gritty that you spend the rest of the day picking blackberry seeds out of your teeth.  This is a beautiful color, the true black of blackberry as God intended.  I don't care if you don't buy it because there's more for me!  Visit me and you'll be served HERO's jam.  For years I had to sneak around and sleuth all sorts of markets and groceries to find it, many of which carried the brand but not the Blackberry.  You know, I'm sure that blackberries are at the top of the naturally healthy germ-fighting products ever blessed on this earth.  And if you're smart enough to buy it online and make your life easier, let alone spare the air from driving around searching for it, you will be so grateful that you found it here and heard from one testimonial just how compelling this rich taste is.  Hey, don't listen to me; more for me!

review/text: My toddler has been enjoying these for a year now.  They are very expensive in stores for just small containers.  The larger Amazon pack is great and much more economical.  Be sure to put the container in a larger ziploc bag after opening to be sure they don't get moist.  The container itself doesn't reseal well enough after opening.<br /><br />These are the only banana chips I've found that are only banana.  Most other brands contain extra sugar plus oil.  These do stick to your teeth when eating dry, but less so than candy and are a much healthier snack for kids.

review/summary: Wonderful snack
review/text: First, let me say that I have tried six different Just Tomato fruit products, and I love all of them.  They dry their fruits just right, leaving it with a wonderful texture.  It does not chew like leather, nor is it so hard that you are afraid of breaking your teeth.  It's just plain good.  That fact that it is not sugar-coated is a big plus in my book.  I occasionally use this particular product in my morning smoothie, but I mostly eat it right out of the container.  Don't expect this to taste like the sugar saturated version that you see next to these the supermarket.  They just take like bananas, which is fine by me.

These chips have nothing added, so you get the nice banana flavor and the crunch without any other additives or fat.  I totally recommed them!

I would do this at least once a week (probably more because I didn't have time to eat breakfast). I would save it until general art and eat it during class, (the teacher allowed it), then finish it up during lunch, the lines were huge and I wouldn't be starving because I ate my Original Chex Mix I bought.<br /><br />The only flaw is that the increase of the Original Chex Mix can be from one dollar at some gas stations, to four dollars at other gas stations.<br /><br />  If you don't get as hungry as often then this is not the product for you, if you do get hungry and it is not even close to time to eat then you should try this product.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a delicious product.

review/summary: Great for making your own coffee drinks
review/text: I wanted to save on calories and money and start making froufy (yes that's a word) coffee drinks at home. I love the Torani sugar free syrups and when I saw this on their website I wanted to try it. I could only find it online and I trust Amazon, so I tried it. I was not disappointed! It has a nice chocolate flavor without the nasty aftertaste some sugar free products have. This large size lasts me 4 months or so. I bought this pump <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CJR62S">Syrup Sauce Pump - 1 1/2" (38mm) For Ghirardelli, Torani, and Da Vinci</a> for this bottle, since I read other pumps may not fit, and I haven't had a problem.<br /><br />I heated 1 cup of skim milk with a couple of tablespoons of Torani SF syrup and a pump of this sauce, mixed it with my cheap Ikea frother, and added it to a cup of hot coffee. Sugar free mocha on the cheap!

review/summary: A bad choice
review/text: So sorry, I have had every chocolate sugar free syrup made, and this was by far the worst I have tried.  I purchased it because it was cheaper than the others, but there was a good reason it was such a good deal.  The consistency was not like a normal chocolate syrup, it came out in big plops.  It was a very strange color, nowhere near a dark brown like any other syrup.  Not that the color has anything to do with it, but when you are dealing with eliminating sugar, all the senses need to be pleased.  To top it all off, it molded very quickly.  I would not recommend this to anyone, even the no name sugar free chocolate syrup at WalMart is better than this....

review/text: Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months.  They are heat sensitive. As the packaging states "IMPORTANT- STORE IN COOL DRY AREA". The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together.  They probably cooked during shipping and are not a "Raw Food" and not as "Nutritious" anymore.  Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened.  Amazon.com does not accept grocery returns.  It was a waste of $40.

review/text: I like this snack, though it is not without its negatives. First, it is expensive... but then again it is suppose to be healthy, so that's a plus that makes up for some of the expense. Also, it seems like a good snack for kids. However, sometimes there is an unpleasant flavor with the "Tropical Fruit" flavor. It is not pleasant when you get a bad piece of dried fruit in your mouth. I also tried the "Organic Strawberries" and like those better, probably giving them a 4 out of 5. The strawberries are good to eat with dark chocolate.

review/summary: don't buy for travels
review/text: I really wanted these to work for travels where I pack all my own food.  However, they are a decidedly poor alternative for travels, since most of the outer coating of the fruit turns into very messy powder.  The strawberry flavor is slightly less of an ordeal in that regards but still messy.  They are probably good for you if you want a stowaway fruit you can use when you haven't gotten to the store for awhile or want it out of season to sprinkle into something, but otherwise the price and messiness are both much too prohibitive.  I've bumped it up from two stars to three, however, after considering how they keep the enzymes intact and don't add sulfites.

review/summary: Really good - little powdery but good
review/text: These taste wonderful.  They are a little powdery, which is to be expected since they are freeze dried, so don't breathe in as you're eating.  Fresh blueberries are better, but these are very good.  I saw a few reviews that mentioned everything arriving as powder, but mine arrived in good shape.<br /><br />One thing I really like is that the only ingredient is blueberries.  There's no sulfur (which I'm allergic to) or corn syrup.  These are good in cereal and as a snack, though you might want to have some water on hand in case you breathe in some blueberry dust.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

If you're going to a festive occasion, or on a big date, or thinking of using it for your lunch break, stick with Sensible Foods Cherry Berries. But if you're at home, or somewhere where you wont mind getting a little messy, try this. The price is well worth it.

review/summary: Best of the freeze dried, and my whole families favorite flavor
review/text: I started buying these as a "to go" snack for my baby/toddler who is allergic to a lot of stuff.  He loved fresh mangos so I selected this flavor.  Now he loves these so much, he seems to object to fresh mangos.  Now the whole family loves them.  We buy all the other flavors (except blueberries, tried them once -- they'd be okay for baking with, but not a great snack).  I've tried 2 other brands of freeze dried foods and I'd say Crunchies brand is the best -- size of pieces, texture/look of pieces, flavor.  Only improvement would be for it to come in a large cannister size too, and even the 1.5 ounce would be better if it was in a hard sided container like "Just ___________" brand (also okay, but more shrivled up, less like airy).<br /><br />Good Job Crunchies!

review/summary: Low Calorie, Nutritious and DELICIOUS...what more could you want?
review/text: I was at Costco one fine Saturday afternoon when they were handing out samples of the Mixed Fruit Crunchies. I was immediately struck by how flavorful they are! Crunchy, and crisp, not leathery like most dried fruit. On their own they are a fun snack for kids and adults alike. I've also discovered that they make great flavoring agents for frostings, truffles, cakes, etc. I used a mortar and pestle to turn, for example, the strawberry Crunchies into a powder, then used that for the Triple Berry tea loaves and the Strawberries & Cream truffles I made during the holidays. The intense, refreshing, true fruit flavor is what I love about these. And the crunch, but then I'm a texture person!<br />p.s. the other reviewer: It's the banana crunchies you think aren't good, I would bet money on it. My daughter doesn't like them either.

review/summary: Stale and Poorly Packaged - No Reply from Manufacturer
review/text: I've bought these pineapple Crunchies in my local grocery store and they were good (though very expensive at about 6 bucks per serving). So when I ordered the six-pack of them here, I expected them to taste just as good. That was not the case at all. The outside of each package was sticky but that didnt bother me much. What bothered me is that the actual product itself was stale. Each piece (in 4 of the 6 bags I opened) was rubbery. Chewing the Crunchies only compressed it into a solid wad of what then seemed like hard plastic. The result was something that simply could not be broken up and swallowed. I also noticed that the built-in ziplock seal didnt work on these bags. After 4 bags, I tossed out the rest and contacted the manufacturer via email (twice). I never received a reply. I think the Crunchies people are selling Amazon bad batches. Avoid these at all cost!

review/text: Crunchies Blueberries are my new favorite snack. Mine arrived whole and in good condition. There was some blueberry powder at the bottom of the bags, but this is only a problem if you love them as much as I do and insist on sifting through the powder to ensure you get every last blueberry. I haven't tried rehydrating them, as I like them crunchy, but my experience with other freeze-dried items is that they rehydrate well. Incidentally, freeze-dried blueberries are a lot cheaper than dried blueberries, but they retain almost all of their nutrients unlike regular dried fruit.

I was holding my 6 months old (who has so far refused all forms of baby food and has only agreed to try the gerber puffies) and he grabbed one off the table and shoved it in his mouth.  It melted in his mouth and he was hooked.  He ended up eating 7 pieces before I cut him off for fear of giving him too much of something he's never had before.  But they kept him very happy for a while.

review/text: I just received a box of the small bags of strawberry and one of the pineapple. The name is CRUNCHIES, but my fruit is anything but crunchy. It is soft and pliable instead of crunchy. I liked the fact that I could get the portion control bags and also that they are made with just the fruit and nothing added.  I had hoped that these would help me keep out of the potato chips, but they are too soft for that. I will use them but will not be purchasing them again. I have had good success with Bare Fruit Apple Chips, but only one flavor comes in the small lunchbox sized bags that I prefer. The Crunchies website said that if air gets to the fruit it will moisten it up and make it soft. I have to assume that the packaging is to blame as how else would air get into unopened bags?

review/text: Ok, so I have never had freeze dried pineapple before, so I am not sure if they are "good" compared to other freeze dried pineapple. But I found them weird. I mean, they taste like pineapple, but they were not crispy-crunchy like freeze dried strawberries, corn, peaches, and other fruit I have had. The texture of these are not like anything I've had before. As first bite, they crunch a little. Then as your teeth sink in, they are kinda hard-chewy, like those hard caramels. I guess they are just not what I was expecting, based on my other experiences so I was disappointed.<br />I don't think they were damaged in shipment, as it wasn't melted together in one big clump. They were still all individual pineapple chunk pieces.

review/summary: Crunchy? More like stale  O.o
review/text: Usually I buy freeze dried pears from whole foods but it costs an arm and a leg so I was SUPER excited to see this available at a decent price.<br /><br />Disappointment doesn't even come close...The pears weren't crunchy in the slightest bit, more like stale and chewy in such a way that it brought about a slight "ick" factor. I was expecting the same quality as Whole Foods (my mistake) but when I opened the bag, it looked like someone had taken a pear slice and crumbled it like a paper ball and dried it.<br /><br />We got this to have healthy snacks on hand but no one in my house can get over that slight "ick" taste and no one will eat it. Whatta waste :(

review/summary: Everything you could want!
review/text: I bought these for my wife who loves anything strawberry. First of all they must lie about the calories because they are very tasty andd sweet. They are not crunchy, by rather they are light and airy. The packages are small, but a great snack and there were twelve of them. That brings me to my recommendation for you to order two boxes, because I just put in an order for a box for my wife. She will be pleased.<br /><br />Also, try the other flavors, I love the pineapple. I was able to buy this set with a coupon that made them a real bargain.

review/summary: not what i expected
review/text: I understand the benefits this product offers, but what it lacks is taste appeal. Kind of like eating a little bit of flavored air. It is lacking a palatable texture. There is some flavor, but not what I expected. Very costly per ounce,$3 for 1.5 oz. It may take8-10 lbs of fresh fruit to make 1 lb of crunchies, but for flavor, texture, and cost, I will definately buy 8-10 lbs. fruit. Sorry I am unable to return the other 5 bags.

review/summary: CRUNCHIES IS DISAPPOINTING
review/text: I've tried almost all low calorie freeze-dried pineapple snacks out there. This snack says it's made in the USA, while most others are imported.  One 1.5 ounce package has 150 calories, which makes it about average on the calorie scale.  "Crunchies" freeze-dried pineapple snacks are not chips, like other freeze-dried pineapple snacks.  "Crunchies" are chunks of freeze-dried pineapple shaped like canned pineapple chunks you buy at the store.  The consistency is very good and it is definitely crunchy.  But to me, the flavor was a little bit off.  I mean it didn't taste like natural pineapple.  The package states that the only ingredient is "pineapple," so I can't figure out why the taste is slightly off.  I opened a second package and tried it, but it was the same.  A third package was the same.  I will not be buying this product again.  If you are looking for a tasty freeze-dried pineapple snack, I recommend "Funky Monkey" or "Crunchy N Yummy" which are both sold by Amazon.

review/summary: you're lucky if you get all the fruits mentioned
review/text: besides purchasing this at the groceries, i ordered twice on Amazon hoping that this product would improve. there is an unequal amount of fruit distributed in each package. out of the six packages only one actually contained mangoes. also, there must literally be only 5 chips of bananas in each package and i have already gone through about 20 by now. the strawberry chips easily get pulverized so if you think you are missing them in your pack, they may already be turned into dust at the bottom.<br /><br />now why, oh why do i still buy them (at the grocery)? my toddler likes the banana chips and mangoes (we now buy the mangoes separately which is another hit and miss on quality). what doesn't get eaten by the little one gets thrown into my breakfast cereal or oatmeal so nothing goes to waste. so for that i'm giving it 3 stars.

review/summary: Unique mix of crunchy dried fruit
review/text: Unlike the usual 'leathery' dried fruit, these freeze dried fruits are crispy.  All have excellent flavor, and are great for diabetic meal plans.  Some of the fruit is very fragile, and becomes powdery- however, the majority keep their shape.  Excellent, healthy snack :)<br /><br />Update:  For Pears...  (my review of the mixed fruit came up for this, so have to add, not do an individual review)<br /><br />The pears are good- but not as crispy as the other flavors. There are only 20 calories per package, so fit into a diabetic meal plan quite nicely.  They also have a gram of fiber per package (good for a 20 calorie item).  The pear flavor isn't really strong 'pear', but they're good. I can see reordering them again.

review/summary: Awesome healthy snack!
review/text: I like these so much I enrolled in the Subscribe & Save over a year ago.  It is not the cheapest snack, but I save money by ordering these in bulk through Amazon rather than buying these from my local grocery store.  There are no artificial ingredients or added sugars; this is just fruit.  Yet, this is a great portable snack that will not go bad sitting in your car, or your child's backpack.  I usually keep a supply in my car to satisfy my huger while driving home from work.<br /><br />I completely disagree with the serving size listed on the package.  It claims five servings per bag.  But, if you're eating these as a snack, you'll only get one serving out of a package, maybe two servings if it's for a child.  If you're using this on top of cereal or yogurt, then of course it will last much longer.  When the bag is empty, you'll find a bunch of fruit powder left at the bottom.  Don't throw it away, this makes a great topping for yogurt.<br /><br />This snack is not for everyone.  My kids and I love them, but my husband can't stand them.  These are not the consistency of other dried fruits, like raisins.  These are crunchy, just as the name implies.  You can happily crunch them like potato chips, or to make them last longer, eat one at a time, and let them slowly dissolve in your mouth, like a sugar cube.  Sweet without the guilt.

review/text: I've tried all of the Crunchies fruits, and these are even better than the strawberries -- which is what attracted me to the brand in the first place. No negatives (even the price is decent), though I'd love to see more fruits in their line-up, such as pears and peaches -- and citrus if they come out well from the process. Highly recommended.

review/text: These used to come as small cubes, they were delicious and the kids loved them. They now come as dry mango slices, the kids still love them. Ok, I eat them too. I think the previous formulation was slightly sweeter, and you could put it in cereal and the like, whereas the slices now are larger so you couldn't do that.<br /><br />Not quite sure why they reformulated them - they appear to have been out of stock for quite a while, and then when they were back in stock they are different. However, still good and still worth purchasing as a healthy snack.

review/summary: Freeze dried
review/text: I purchased these because I was curious to what all the different fruits would taste freeze-dried.  I realized that I'm not such a big fan of it because of the sudden transition from crunch to mush in the mouth.  I would rather have actual fruit that retain the crunchiness for me to enjoy as a snack.  However, I think these would be really good to mix into your morning cereal, both dry and with liquid, hot or cold.<br /><br />Half of these packages had a considerable amount of powder at the bottom...so I'm thinking I lost about 10% of the 1.5 oz of product.

Not a bad idea, but in the meantime, this is a great way to go.<br /><br />We always use at least one large, fresh green hot pepper, and often add one or two dried peppers (often chipotles) as well, for a fuller, more fiery flavor.<br /><br />Serve these dishes with plain yogurt and some naan, and you're livin'!
