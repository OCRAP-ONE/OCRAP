review/summary: Duck Sauce
review/text: Sauce was just as I expected. Taste is excellent. It actually tastes like the duck sauce from the Chinese restaurants. The only problem is one of the jars was broken. Packaging seems to be a problem so be careful when you open box.

review/summary: Dai Dai Duck Sauce
review/text: This product is a must for making stir-fry, with a little soy sauce. I've had problems obtaining same at the supermarket where I first encountered it.Now Amazon is my reliable source, this  is my 2nd time 4 unit purchase. I don't keep  a history of the sellers... I just purchase a 4 unit pack so its probably not the same seller since it takes awhile for replenishing, but this time around one jar was broken on arrival, and I was refunded without a problem. It is as pictured. Store in pantry until ready to use, then once open ,I refridgerate. It is securely screwed-on, first time jar opening for me reqires a jar opener and extra hands! Right now I do not have a plan B if Amazon runs out of this wonderful sauce.

review/text: I started drinking this when I was pregnant since I could only have 1 cup of caffienated coffee a day.  This allowed me to have 2 if I wanted since it's only half the caffiene.  I liked it so much, I never went back to full strength.  My husband likes it, too.  It doesn't have that watered down decaf taste like some decaf coffees.  It's got a nice flavor to it.

review/summary: New Maxwell House
review/text: Just a note to remind folks that Maxwell House has changed it's blend and if you order you will probably get the "new" MH, which is a stronger "coffee house" blend.  Not the fault of Amazon.  I ordered it in the vacuum bag and was lucky enough to get the original blend. I reordered, but am not sure which will show up.  I will say that Amazon does take about a week to ship it out, which seems long to me.  If you then add the actual shipping time to that it can be anywhere from 10 days to 2 weeks before you get your order. I am hoping enough people will complain to MH and they will bring back the original blend.

review/text: When I made this order on Amazon I ordered the Rich Lite, but received the lite which is a bolder taste.  When I tried to return the case (unopened) the website told me that is was a non-returnable item.  There is no way to make contact with Amazon to return this item and get what I had ordered.  So, we are stuck with a case of coffee that we do not like and will never drink.  A complete waste of money.

review/summary: scorpian sucker
review/text: I bought a scorpian suker at amazon, and I like it. Yes, I did eat it. I like to try weird foods so I ate completely around the suker. I kind of chomped off the sucker parts that surrounded the scorpian. The scorpian has a texture of paper, and has an aftertaste of Ben And Jerry's vinila ice cream. You will be satisfied with the sucker part wich taste more like rock candy.

review/text: The lollipop itself is vabout an inch thick, but is only about two inches in length. The taste of the coating seems off somehow, and it was unpleasant at first but I got used to it. The scorpion inside is minuscule at best, and disgustingly unedible. The body is crunchy and doesn't break down well, with a strong sesame seed type taste. It was gross, and I can't believe I paid that much for one.

review/summary: Blueberry Scorpion Sucker
review/text: These suckers are great for a "Fear Factor" event.  Those who tried this flavor liked it.  There was a preference for the apple flavor, though.  The sucker was pleasant, and the scorpion added  an adrenaline "rush".  (Most disliked having scorpion body parts lodge between their teeth as some body parts are particularly small and narrow).<br /><br />As a word of caution:  Do NOT bit this sucker anywhere near to the time of first attempting to eat it.  You WILL break a tooth or two.<br /><br />Some of the teenagers at our event say they regularly purchase these suckers because they like them.  (Come on, they must want to freak someone else out!)<br /><br />They are deliciously daunting.

This feature was included no where on the website, before or after making the purchase, and so I purchased this thinking it was another product. Oh, and there is a no return policy on this idem.

I understand that all citronella products have some odor but this candle's odor is particularly potent and unpleasant. It also tends to be a little smokier than some other citronella candles I've used before.<br /><br />In the future I think I'll be trying a different brand.

review/summary: Subtly smokey goodness
review/text: Hojicha is a delicious every day tea. And the Mighty Leaf bags are especially nice because they're silken and won't impart any "paper" flavor into your brew. I hunted down this tea after suffering too many terrible decaf black teas. True, hojicha has a bit more caffeine than a decaf tea, but when I consider the flavor pay-off (nice subtle smokiness, not even a hint of bitterness) I can't really go back. Sometimes, I "decaffeinate" it myself by letting it steep for 45 seconds in hot water, tossing out the brew, and then drinking the second infusion. (From what I've read, the caffeine comes out in the initial steeping). I lose a little flavor when I do this, but it's still much tastier than any commercial decaf I've ever had.

review/summary: One of my favorite brands in convenient packaging
review/text: One of the reasons I like Marrakesh Express brand couscous is I have no problems finding it in most grocery stores in Central Florida.<br /><br />It is consistent in preparation. What I mean by that is if you follow the instructions to the letter each serving of couscous is going to be identical to past ones. I have used brands that I will not name that are not as consistent or as repeatable when preparing it.<br /><br />Another nice feature is for those of us who routinely consume couscous the packaging makes storage and maintaining freshness easier by using a tight plastic reusable lid on a cardboard canister.<br /><br />What is nice about my local area is I can also purchase the Marrakesh Express Grande couscous, which is also known as Israeli couscous. It would be wonderful if Amazon also carried that type because the pricing here is far more attractive when purchased in bulk than it is in my local supermarkets.<br /><br />I've uploaded a customer-supplied image on this page to portray my favorite brands of couscous, which includes the Grande type I mentioned.  My other favorites - brands that are consistent and repeatable - are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HQPNZY">Sadaf Couscous, Original Flavor, 13-Ounce Boxes, (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDP5TI">Vigo Couscous, 10-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a>.

Folks, we have been eating chocolate-flavored crayon shavings!  These are amazing and have become a breakfast tradition at our home.  We eat them on toast-spread with peanut butter and just a light sprinkle of chocolate-and I'm talking REAL chocolate, here!<br />I was so happy to find these on Amazon without having to have them shipped from the Netherlands.  They are also great, of course, used in place of those sad old "jimmies" on baked goods and ice creams.  You'll never go back to crayons.

review/text: Regarding chocolate sprinkles, these are as close to perfect as one can get.  I'm a baker, and these aren't just pretty embellishments like regular sprinkles; they add something rich and delightful to the finished product (topping a buttercream frosting, rolled around a truffle, etc).  They're also lovely eaten alone, on a spoon...not something I could undertake with regular, waxy, store-bought jimmies.  I do also use another brand of chocolate vermicelli that is finer and more delicate in size and texture, but for a go-to chocolate punch, these are the ones to use!  I highly recommend them.

If I am lucky enough to find it under ten dollars the shipping price raises so high it's rediculous. I found this set of three and I was able to get free shipping on it by buying something small with it and I was amazed at how little it cost. I can now be a happy fat kid (in figuative speaking).<br /><br />*Since I wrote this review the first time I have been so happy to find these. The sprinkles are so delicious being real chocolate. I even convinced a few other people to try them in the classic way with white bread and butter! They are also delicious on ice cream, cake pops, cupcakes, and so many other delicious sweets.

review/text: I was really excited when I fund these online, having been looking for "real" sprinkles that actually had chocolate, not chemicals and corn syrup.  The ingredients are much better quality than the typical sprinkles one finds in the USA, but unfortunately the main ingredient is sugar and it tastes that way.  I like chocoloate sprinkles on vanilla ice cream, but these are just way too sweet. Instead, I'm just grating blocks of good dark chocolate.  Some extra effort, but tastes much better than these super sweet sprinkles.  Too bad.

Beside the white crappy look of them they were short and fat, not the elegant chocolate sprinkles I wanted. They didn't even taste good. I had a few king arthur sprinkles that I made stretch for my event and from now on will only be ordering them from now on.

I was leary to sample them, sure that they would have a funky taste of some sort. But I was oh so wrong. These chips are made of a prefectly delicious semi-sweet chocolate that kids and adults (at least in my family) love.<br /><br />I like that they are mini-chips too, since there aren't any other dairy-free mini-chips readily available on the market (let alone allergen-free). It also makes the bag last much longer. I can't say why, but even with regular use in recipes, this bag lasts us twice as long as the more sizable morsels from TJ's (and that bag contains 2 ounces more!). So for me, it is worth the cost difference.

There are other brands out there that have good ingredients, but this brand is the only one I can find that also has this tiny sized chip. I love the ingredients, taste and size. We use them for baking and for trail mix. A regular sized chocolate chip is just too much in a handful of trail mix - especially if you have little ones who don't need much in the way of chocolate.

Good expiration date (more than 6 months from now).<br />3.  Manufactured in a dairy-free facility.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1.  Mediocre in texture and taste. They are waxy, in fact. The flavor is pretty one-dimensional.<br />2.  They don't label how much cacao it contains (in % terms.)  For ex., our preference is 71% content.<br />3.  If you've ever had awesome quality, complex dark chocolate, then you might be disappointed when you taste these.<br />.

review/text: I hit 21 and for some reason started developing food allergies left and right.  Several years later and there are so many foods, including (but not limtited to)all tree nuts, sunflower and safflower seeds/oil, oats, red berries and sulfates, that set me off terribly and with increasing sensitivity.<br /><br />Chocolate seemed to be one of the new aggressors and I've been trying to tough it out with carob, but it just doesn't cut it for me.<br /><br />I had an epiphany when I saw these in the store and wondered it could possibly be all the junk chocolate can get processed with or shared equiptment that was setting me off.<br /><br />Success!! I tried a little, waited, nothing happened. Repeated the next day  with a couple of table spoons and again, no excema, throat swelling or digestive problems, which never hesitate to make them selves known if I have a problem with a food.<br /><br />NOT that I recomend trial and error to people who think they are allergic to anything, though that IS what my doctors came up with for my specific case, and I'm really exicited that I didn't react.<br /><br />Going to probably buy these in bulk and try not to go crazy after 3 months of trying to like carob!<br /><br />Seriously though, in the non-allergic epoch of my life, I was a chocolate snob.  If I wanted chocolate I would splurge on a three dollar bar of the good stuff and avoided Hersey's like the plague. I'm not sure how much of my present taste is colored by desperation and deprevation but I think this stuff is REALLY good.

review/text: I bought these for my daughter, who has had to go dairy and gluten free. She's lost sooo much weight (5'8" , weighs 115 pounds!) that I began looking for something she can eat that will add calories to her diet.<br /><br />One of the things she missed most was chocolate, and I was thrilled to find these. They not only fit her dietary requirements, they really are yummy! They may not equal "good" organic dark chocolate (chips have to have less cacao butter to hold their shape when baking) but we have found them pretty creamy, chocolate-y and scrumptious.<br /><br />Factor in the reasonable price and Amazon's super quick (FREE) shipping, and the whole purchase was a winner.<br />I will be back for more of these--at least my daughter has slowed her weight loss

review/summary: I was PLEASANTLY surprised!
review/text: When I ordered these chocolate chips I thought they wouldn't be very good.  (But hoped they would be)I am fairly new to "Dairy Free" so my expectations were not high. They tasted so much like regular semi-sweet chocolate chips, my family didn't even notice.  The only thing they asked was why I used mini chips and not regular size. I would recommend them to anyone who was craving chocolate and couldn't have dairy.  They are so good.  Haven't tried to melt them yet but they will probably work.

We made flour-free peanut butter cookies with these (for GF/CF diet) and they are delicious.  Just eating the chips out of the bag are tasty!

review/summary: AWESOME for dairy sensitive people!
review/text: I have a dairy/milk/lactose sensitivity. It's not an allergy, so I can not speak in terms of that, but...I LOVE THESE! I can eat them with no side affects, no issues, and no problems. It's rare I can find items that say they are dairy free and they work out so this find was GREAT!! Highly recommend. I put some in some cookies and fed my super picky nieces...they had no idea (and still don't, lol) of the lack of dairy in these.

review/text: THE ONLY SOY-FREE CHIPS I COULD FIND!<br /><br />Great chocolate flavor.  Great texture.  In fact, they are so good that I would choose these over conventional chocolate chips any time!  Mini chip size is nice - they make excellent chocolate chip cookies.  A bag of these in our home rarely sees cookie dough, we just eat them straight out of the bag most of the time!  Also great to make trail mixes (Enjoy Life Mountain Mambo is fantastic if you don't want to make your own).  Enjoy Life Chocolate chips & Newman's Own Organic raisins are a fabulous treat too.  I very highly recommend these whether you need to go dairy-free or not!

review/text: I've had to change my diet drastically and I was missing dark chocolate so much!  Until I found these chocolate chips I thought I'd have to give up all store bought dark chocolate... these don't have anything bad; unless you think these ingredients are bad: Evaporated Cane Juice, Chocolate Liquor, Non-Dairy Cocoa Butter.  That's it, that's all these have in them.  These are worth every penny and so delicious!!  I get them at Clark's Market; a bit expensive but like I said they're worth it so that I can eat chocolate again!!!

review/summary: chocolate chips = Happy woman
review/text: Having food allergies is no fun. Especially when you are allergic to all things dairy. I developed these allergies later in life so I already new the joys of chocolate. It is hard to find a chocolate that does not have milk or any type of dairy in it. When you get lucky enough to find one it usually is processed in a plant that processes dairy or tree nuts (another allergy). I was so happy to find these chips. I use them to make my version of Chocolate chip cookies and other delightful treats. Thank you for making an allergy free treat for us unlucky few. If you have food allergies these are a pretty safe bet.

They taste just as good, if not better, than other chocolate chips only without all the extra ingredients.  They baked well in a cake and acted like other chips.  I cannot wait to try them in other recipes.  My only regret is not getting these sooner.

review/text: I have no food allergies, but like to avoid soy as mush as possible. Soy-free chocolate is hard to find. But these are by far the best tasting chocolate chips ever (and I have tried almost every dairy-free chocolate chip)! I like that they're mini, too. I just wish they hard a "dark" variety. I often eat them by themselves when I'm craving some chocolate, but don't feel like baking.

review/text: I needed these for my toddler granddaughter who has allergies to dairy, egg, and peanuts.  This product is free from all that worry.  The chips are small, love that, b/c I even use this in my cannoli filling and can pipe it out of a star-tip pastry bag w/o clogging up the works. They taste absolutely identical to any other chocolate chip, not 'off' tasting. In the health-food stores, this is about $5 a bag.  At this price I can bake with it and use more w/o worry of being a spendthrift. I made allergy-safe chocolate chip cookies with these yesterday and I had to stop myself from eating them all...a great product.

I like the smaller size "mini-chips" in that I feel like I can use less and they go further.
