review/summary: Achva Marble Halva
review/text: Great flavor, nearly gourmet-style.  Downright addictive!  Obviously hand-made, but more effort needs to be put into mixing to get a better marbling presentation.  Rigid plastic packaging does not stand up well to transport the way it was simply stacked in the box.  Manufacturer needs a slightly larger box that would provide room for bubble-pack or styro-peanuts to protect contents.

review/summary: Americolors are good but this vendor is questionable
review/text: I've purchased many different Americolor gel colors and am happy with them when they are fresh. I purchased 7 bottles from this TCP vendor and 5 of them were old, one even had a use by date of one year before my order! Working with TCP to get a refund has not been as pleasant as working directly with Amazon. I finally did get a refund but only for the product, not the shipping charges. The products were old and unusable. I am very disappointed with this vendor and will purchase my colorants from another more reliable source. Americolor is good TCP is not.

review/summary: Long lasting and QUIET entertainment for our dog...
review/text: After many years of calm, geriatric dogs that were long past their chewing (and playing) days, we added a 15-month old Weimaraner rescue to our house as 2012 started. He's adapting to life outside of the rescue home, and we're adapting the double-barreled threat of a high-energy breed and what can only be described as lingering puppy brain (in the full size body of a grown dog).<br /><br />There are toys for exuberant play (such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MD57ZI">Kong Wubba</a>), and there are toys for quieter times, and to fully satisfy a dog's need to chew.<br /><br />First, the dog loves this chew. And when he engages with it, the result is an extended period of time when we does so in one place (very much unlike other toys, which generated motion and noise!).<br /><br />Second, it's odor and splinter free. We don't find pieces of it laying around, and it has no smell (at least to us two-legged critters).<br /><br />This was recommended to us by a local dog specialty store, and the research I've done indicates far fewer concerns about its safety compared with other chew options.<br /><br />Makes our dog happy and lets him turn down his motor a bit. What's not to like?

review/summary: Amazing Product
review/text: I decided to get this item for my new shelter dog.  He went through dog toys like mad and most dog chews would be swallowed whole, only to be puked up later on.  I was trying to find a product that he would get excited about chewing on and wouldn't be destroyed within minutes.  Boy did this fit the bill!  He has had it for well over a month now and has not even made his way through 25% of it yet.  It doesn't have a smell and it hasn't broke off into pieces.  I recommend this product to all my friends who have dogs and will be buying another one when the time comes!

review/summary: Perfect for Agressive Chewers!
review/text: I bought this antler chew bone for my daughters dog who chews up just about any chew bone almost instantly! The dog is a Corgi German Shepherd mix.  My daughter says these antler bones are the only type that just last and last, and her dog gets a lot of chewing satisfaction.  These are natural antler bones which are "harvested" from the forest after being shed by a moose. Recommend highly, especially if your dog can chew most bones up in minutes.  These antler bones last for weeks!

He really likes it and I like that fact that there is no yucky smell like some dog treats have (bully sticks, etc....)  THis is the first Moose antler he's had.  The elk antler seemed to be less dense in the middle and didn't last quite as long as the deer antler before it did.  We've yet to see how the moose antler will stand up to time.  For the cost, I hope it lasts at least 1 1/2 months.  :-)

review/summary: My Puggle Pup Loves It!
review/text: My puggle pup is only 6 months old and he loves this antler chew. He's on his second one. The first one I think I bought like two months ago. It was a medium antler. The one he got today is 7-10 in. He stays on these antlers for a long time. Really keeps him busy. And It does not splinter as, from what I've read, other antlers do. I know it's up there in terms of price, but if you love your pup and don't want to give him garbage, then by this antler. I will update this post in the not-too-distant future with info as to how long it lasted.

review/text: I've been buying antlers from Chasing Our Tails for a while now and never had a problem with the size -- that is, until now.

I'm disappointed of the size and quality of the one I just received. I'm going to buy another one -- 7-10 inch -- and if the quality is the same and small I will not buy from Chasing Our Tails Again.

review/text: I ordered this X-Large 11 - 14 inch antler for my great dane that loves to chew.  When I received it I immediately noticed it looked really thick, but smaller than I expected.  I measured it and it was less than 10 inches in length.  He appears to love it and is chewing on it constantly.  I certainly recommend it but I'm not sure if they sent me the wrong size, they are really out of the X-Large so they made due or if the length of these vary outside of the advertised length.  Considering the price of these, I was expecting an 11 - 14 inch antler that would last a good 1 to months. Time will tell!

review/summary: Lithe and balanced, Woodford is a polished sophisticated bourbon.
review/text: Woodford Reserve has a cult following and it's easy to understand why: it has a lean, semi-dry, aspect that emphasizes herbal and botanical notes and downplays the resiny fruity "candy corn"'aspect one often finds in bourbons. It is sophisticated and grown up hooch for more discriminating palates.<br /><br />Woodford is a lovely medium amber color - darker than Makers or Beam but lighter than lighter than, say Kentucky Spirit or Craig 18. It's lovely. Nose is full of toffee walnut and tobacco. There's some leather and cream too. First sip opens bright with honeyed corn. Vanilla notes from oak arrive shortly and the midpalate blooms with herbal and floral aspects that mute the sweetness combined with the leather and tobacco meets toffee aspect. Finish is medium long and a bit dry with oak vanilla floral qualities and a kiss of distant smoke. It's a very tasty experience - if lacking the depth of flavor of the very best. The absence of "corn likker" fruitiness is most appreciated. This is a good bourbon for convincing scotch drinkers to consider bourbon.

review/summary: Too small
review/text: I've been buying antlers from Chasing Our Tails for a while now and never had a problem with the size -- that is, until now. I purchased a 5-7 inch antler and the one I received was like 4 inches. And darker than the other ones. My puggle chewed it down in two days. I'm disappointed of the size and quality of the one I just received. I'm going to buy another one -- 7-10 inch -- and if the quality is the same and small I will not buy from Chasing Our Tails Again. They're expensive.

review/summary: smaller than expected
review/text: I ordered this X-Large 11 - 14 inch antler for my great dane that loves to chew.  When I received it I immediately noticed it looked really thick, but smaller than I expected.  I measured it and it was less than 10 inches in length.  He appears to love it and is chewing on it constantly.  I certainly recommend it but I'm not sure if they sent me the wrong size, they are really out of the X-Large so they made due or if the length of these vary outside of the advertised length.  Considering the price of these, I was expecting an 11 - 14 inch antler that would last a good 1 to months. Time will tell!

review/summary: Great candy, poor delivery
review/text: I ordered this candy from this company twice.  The first time, the six boxes arrived crammed together so tightly that the product was spilling out of the boxes and the boxes were damaged.  They were meant to be gifts for Christmas, but were hardly in gift condition.  The second time I ordered them, I got a reply back saying that they were sold out and a refund would be issued. Both they and Amazon later insisted the refund was issued, but I ended up letting my bank go after it.  Not a good experience and I won't order from this distributor again.

review/text: I prepared them like I had them prepared for me when I was at a Buddhist monastery, cleaned, sliced thinly and salted and peppered and they were great at the monastery but these had a funky stronger odor and a slightly moldy flavor, though I couldn't see any mold on the product.  I've frozen the ones I didn't use and will thaw later to see if that helps with the flavor.  It's not worth returning but I wouldn't recommend them.

review/text: The root arrived fresh and in good condition (95%).  The roots were active when shredded and used in a natural fermentation process by soaking at room temperature 70 - 80 F. covered by cheesecloth for three days.  I used them with ginger,and the resultant soda-like drink was delicious, flavorful, and intensely yellow-orange.  One pound made four gallons plus, and lasted when put in with paper towel in a plastic ziploc for about a month refrigerated.  Would use again.

review/text: I love, love, LOVE this wine.  I am not usually a white wine drinker and I am by no means a wine snob.  I just really enjoy reasonably priced wine that is versatile enough to go with many dishes and/or tastes great on it's own.  This Riesling is smooth and flavorful.  Most Rieslings are too sweet for me but I find that Kung Fu has a crisp aftertaste that allows me to enjoy more then one glass without feeling like I am getting sick from sugar intake.  It tastes best to me during the summer time, or at least in warmer weather as it is served chilled.  Plus, with a name like Kung Fu Girl, how can you go wrong??

review/summary: Good Quick Stroganoff
review/text: My husband really, really likes this stroganoff meal. There is never enough left in the skillet for me to have second helpings -- he'd eat the entire box if he could! I do recommend browning the meat before adding the mix. Also, very lean hamburger (93% lean) doesn't have the flavor that an 85% lean meat has, so save some money there and enjoy the flavor more. I did use a steak for one of the meals, though, and that worked pretty well, too. So if you want to "upscale" the dinner you can certainly do that. This is a good quick dinner for workdays.

I have some left over and plan on freezing it in individual containers for friends who need to be on organic diets.  We'll see how the freezing part works out.

Even my husband, who ate it as a side dish, was impressed. I could have pulled this off as my own dish had I thought to do that, lol!<br /> I added Wegman's  organic grass fed beef tenderloin steak (cubed small) and also about 3/4 cup fresh mushrooms & about 1/2 cup fresh garlic, onion & scallops I put through the food processor so my kids would not detect them & 1% organic milk. The meal came out perfect: Quick, easy, delicious, good for you & we all enjoyed it!! One day I may attempt my mom's amazing beef stroganoff recipe she never quite remembers in it's entirety as she is a former chef and cooks from her heart, but for now... this Annie's product was a SCORE!!

review/summary: The finest pasta sauce available!
review/text: I have tried most of mezzettas sauces as they are carried by my local grocer. Mezzetta uses the very sweetest ripe san marzano tomatoes i have ever had. No sugar, paste or corn syrup in the ingredient list which is a sure indicator of a cheap garbage sauce. This sauce is first rate by any account. The designation of home style on the label is misleading though. This sauce could be served in a high end italian restaurant right out of the jar and i kid you not. Their sauces have napa valley wine in the Ingredients. I have not seen any others with wine in their sauces which is the way gourmet sauces are really made. If you can find a better tasting sauce in a jar than there is something wrong with your taste buds or you are buying a sauce loaded with sugar and you like refined sugar. There is only three grams of sugar per serving but you cant tell that because of the natural sweetness of their tomatoes. They also use sea salt which has a lessened effect on blood pressure. This is perfect for those who like sweet sauces but must control sugar intake and want a pasta sauce. In fact this sauce is just plain perfect for anybody period. Though mezzetta sells a pizza sauce you would do just fine with this right here. I pay three dollars a jar when on sale. The grocer sells for six per when not on sale and mezzetta sells for 4.70 per jar or 21.15 per case plus shipping. Shipping will double the price. Buy this with great confidence of the highest quality, standards and taste, you will not be disappointed!

review/summary: Reasonable quality at a reasonable price
review/text: Pros:<br />Reasonably cheap<br />Tortillas are reasonably flavorful and much better than my other tortilla purchases from Amazon.<br />Seasoning mix is tasty.<br />The mild taco sauce is quite good.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Don't expect the hard taco shells to be intact. I don't mind, but better than half of those I received were shattered - there really isn't a way to fix this on Amazon or Old El Paso's part, as that's just the nature of shipping and handling.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />It's substantially cheaper than the convenience store, it shows up at my apartment, and it tastes good. If you aren't picky about the condition of the hard shells, this is a good buy.

review/summary: Low Calorie Large beats Dentastix
review/text: My dog loves this treat and I like it better than the Pedigree Dentastix. I'm comparing the two products to each other because they look so similar in color, size, shape. But my dog will tell you that the texture is definitely different. The Zoe appears tougher and chewier. It last minutes longer than the Dentastix per serving. My dog will sit and take his time to chew through the Zoe chew stix, which I like. Compared to the Pedigree stuff I get from my local Target which seems to disappear in his mouth and he's begging again after just a few seconds. The manufacturer's feeding directions says to feed two sticks a day. The calorie count is 90 per stick. I can't recommend that to your pet. I'm going to give this as a once a week treat, alternating with other stuff since my cocker is prone to getting fat. Unlike Dentastix, this does not indicate any dental health benefits. Still, this is made of quinoa and is gluten free, in case you care about that stuff. Cute packaging and is conveniently resealable. I would buy again and recommend to others.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have bought this again since my dog loves it so much. The second package I got, I actually decided to count houw many sticks came in one bag. There are only 6 if you get the large size like I do. 6 stick for $6. They tell you to give one or two sticks a day. Nevermind the calories (90 per stick)... but one bag might not even last you a week if you follow manufacturer's directions. Kind of pricey at $1 per stick. Greenies on Amazon (regular size) are less expensive. Anyway, I still think that this is a great product and I would still buy it... but believe me, I will be buying less often and only give it to my dogs on special ocassions!

review/summary: Unfortunately caused an allergy to my poochie
review/text: This treat did not have good reaction with my Jack Russell terrier mix, he ate it fine and even enjoyed it, but then he suddenly became quite hyper and nervous like he was having caffeine shakes.  I definitely will not be feeding this to him again.  It is too bad also since this looked to be a great treat, I looked at the ingredient list and did some research on all the ingredients and the only one that can cause an allergy is carrageenan, which is the vegetarian equivalent of casein, used as filler.  It is a natural ingredient derived from seaweed, but is said to cause digestive problems.  Most doggie treats do not contain carrageenan so this is the only ingredient that may have caused a reaction in my dog.  I am giving the treat two stars for the effort and intention, but there really should have been more research regarding the fillers.

review/summary: Variety is the spice of life
review/text: I have 2 dogs and while I don't give a lot of treats, I like to have a variety of items on hand to put in the everlasting ball, Kong etc., to keep them interested on days when the weather is not conducive to getting out.  My thought with these sticks was that if I cut a little off one end, it would be a perfect fit for the everlasting ball.  It turns out, they are hard as a rock!  I tried a couple of different knives and even my meat cleaver, but none of them made any headway in cutting off the 2" I needed to remove.  Then I picked it up and tried to break it with my hands, and it snapped in two right on the line I had been trying to cut (perhaps I scored it a little).  Anyway, it turns out that is the secret to these things - breaking instead of cutting.<br /><br />I am not in the least concerned about the caloric value of them so that was not figured into my perception of the treats in any way.  One of my dogs is slender - the other downright skinny (has a high metabolism and is offered plenty to eat but never finishes a meal).  The older, slender dog got the 2" bit I cut off and the younger skinny dog got the remainder of the stick in her everlasting ball.  May not be fair but she had to work harder to get it so it all comes out in the wash.<br /><br />The older dog practically took my hand off to get to the treat quickly.  Once she had it, she ran off and put it back on the floor so she could take her time with it.  I will say that the little 2" stick lasted her much longer than I would have expected so I rate them high for that reason.  The chewing action is good for their teeth/jaws and is far preferable to a treat they gobble down without tasting.<br /><br />The younger dog went racing after her everlasting ball and stayed busy for a long time trying to get it out.  I wasn't around when she finally succeeded to know how long it took her to eat it but am glad it kept her interested for awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is cute and the bag is resealable.  I believe they are kind of pricey and for that reason I might not order them again.  Otherwise I am completely satisfied.

review/summary: The dog loves it!
review/text: Normally, I spell out the ingredients off of the package when I do these reviews; but I'm learning that people do not mark that as helpful.  So, if you are curious about the ingredients...please read the description!  And, I obviously have not ate one of these dog treats personally!  But I can tell you this much--my dog loves these treats.  In fact, I have never seen her run so fast to get a treat.  If I leave the package out on the counter...she hangs around and sits until I give her one.  She actually will mind perfectly if she knows these treats are out.  It's kind of funny, really!  I honestly have to hide them...because other wise she will keep sniffing under the pantry door.  The product itself smells like a dog treat, and it's a good sized treat for my dog.  (She is a 78 pound boxer)  So for smaller dogs you could probably break it in half and make the bag last longer.  My dog has eaten the sticks on the carpet...and I have not noticed any stains, so I don't think there is a lot of coloring to them.  I clean up after her anyway because that is my preference...but I don't get the brown color like other treats.  Anyway, because of my dogs response to them...I am getting them again.  They'll make a great stocking stuffer!!

review/summary: My Aussie kinda likes them
review/text: My 5-year-old Australian shepherd, Pete, has put on a lot of weight in the last 18 months, so I was curious to see how he would take to a low calorie treat.<br />I placed a regular size Milk Bone, a small Beggin' Strip, and a Zoe treat stick side-by-side on the carpet and invited Pete to help himself.<br />Being wary like most Aussies, he cautiously sniffed each offering, then took the Milk Bone. When he was finished with the Milk Bone, he picked the Beggin' Strip. Finally, when there was only one choice left, he took the Zoe treat stick.<br />I did this test with him four times to see if he would develop a taste for the Zoe treat sticks, but the results were always the same.<br />From a health and caloric point of view, the Zoe treat sticks may be the better choice, but Pete's interested in them only if nothing else is available.<br />I suppose that's true of people and diet food too.<br />At any rate, Pete gives 'em 2 stars.

review/summary: Healthy treat!
review/text: Zoe Lifestyle Treats for Dogs are a healthy alternative to the typical high-calorie dog snacks which you find in stores today. The product is gluten-free and is a good source of soluble fiber. These treats are as hard as a rock which would probably be troublesome for older dogs with poor teeth. I tested these treats on a 2-year-old lab and a 9-year-old golden retriever. Keep in mind...they will eat just about anything. Both dogs threw the sticks on the ground and proceeded to sniff them.  I am not sure, but I think the cinnamon spice flavor threw them off a bit.  After rolling the sticks around on the ground, I am happy to report that they ate them. The next day, I offered them another treat and they didn't seem too excited. Overall, if you are into healthy dog food, these snacks are sensible treats. Personally, I wouldn't buy them again due to the price and the firmness of the product. I would be concerned that my dog would break a tooth.

review/summary: Great item, disappointing price & shipping service from Amazon
review/text: Love these treats for my puppy and my veterinarian was pleased with this product since the pup is slightly overweight and made in the USA, unfortunately they are quite pricey.  But when I started on the automatic monthly shipments from Amazon at the reduced price, Amazon cancelled the automatic shipments before the first shipment, for whatever reason, so now I have to buy them at the full higher price.  I guess someone wanted MORE MONEY so I will have to either buy them less frequently or find somewhere else to get them at a better price or look for something else.  How sad for my puppy, she really, really enjoys these treats.

review/summary: A great dog treat for special diet or sensitive needs
review/text: I saved these treat sticks for my German Shepherd who had been licking her paws a lot to the point of bleeding.  When I told the vet about it she suggested a wheat free diet. These treats went right along with that new diet since they are gluten-free, wheat-free, corn-free, and soy-free.  They are also good for the dogs teeth.  She liked them and enthusiastically ate them all. The vet was right..... along with diet changes, to include these low calorie treats, my German Sheppard quit her over-licking problem.  They are somewhat solid, but chewy for the dog and it's evident the dog enjoyed the taste.  I will continue to use these treats for my Shepherd and will purchase the medium sized treat sticks for my smaller English Setter.

review/text: I have a dog that is a Jack Russell Terrier that will eat anything and her weight shows it... So it really isn't saying much that she likes these treats. On the plus side, they are low-calorie and it takes her longer to eat one of the Zoe sticks than it does to eat one of her nightly Dentastix (the two products look very similar) but I suppose the Zoe sticks are denser and a bit tougher to chew through and so last longer.  If they are low-calorie and she'll eat it, I consider it a good product!

review/summary: 3 out of 4 dogs found this treat acceptable
review/text: One out of one owner-and-buyer-of-dog-treats thought they were not worth the cost.<br /><br />A few additional thoughts:<br /><br />I cannot see an "item count" on the package.  In the picture, the treats look like skinny pencils.  In fact, each treat is the size of four skinny pencils, with eight in the bag.<br /><br />"Cinnamon spice" is a people-flavor.  "Rancid road kill" is a dog flavor.  "rancid road kill" does not sell well.  That said, buy treats for your dogs, if that's who will be eating them, not yourself.<br /><br />My larger dogs (70#, excellent teeth, and 30#, bad teeth) inhaled these chews, taking just a little longer than they would take to eat fresh meat.  For this price, chews have to last a bit longer.<br /><br />I do not understand how the chews could be considered "hard" if used straight from the package.  YMMV.  My Chihuahua took two days to eat his.  He left a mess.  The bigger dogs didn't.<br /><br />My larger, 55# and underweight, young girl dog would not touch these chews on two different days.  She is one of the last dogs on the planet who needs either low fat or low calorie treats, so perhaps she was using good doggie judgement in not wasting chewing-effort-calories on a treat that may have a negative caloric payoff.

review/text: The smell isn't pretty as with most dog treats. But my dogs knew as soon as they heard this bag what they were getting.  The treat is hard for them to chew on for a little bit. Not like a rawhide that last for days, but enough to keep them busy for a while.  Since there's an odd number in the package I had to attempt to break one in half. It was difficult but I did it to split between the two dogs. They loved it.

review/summary: Good treat, but pricey
review/text: My dogs love chewy treats and these seemed like a good possible option to combine a safe and healthy treat with the opportunity to chew.  On the positive side, there was no excess packaging, the treats arelow calorie, gluten free  and safe/healthy for your dog if given in the recommended amounts and even for dogs on strict diets.  There's a nice cinnamon smell that's appealing to humans.  Both my dogs appeared to enjoy this treat and were eager for a second once they ate the first, so in addition to the positive aspects for a cautious owner, it was also popular with the intended audience.<br /><br />However, I'd also caveat this with a few other issues.  First, the package says a medium dog could get 2 sticks per day.  There are six sticks in a bag and the cost is $6 - that's fairly pricey given that my dogs (admittedly expert, hardy chewers) ate their sticks in less than 5 minutes.  While the cinnamon scent is appealing to humans, one of my dogs didn't seem excited about it at first.  She did decide to eat it after a couple minutes (she initially put it down and backed away), but only because the other dog expressed interest.  Once she ate the first one, she seemed more than willing to take another, but there was an initial hesitation.  I'd expected something that might take longer to chew through.  I'm the first to admit my dogs are super-chewers, so if your dog doesn't have jaws of steel, you might get more out of this treat, but it took between 2 -4 minutes (depending on which of the dogs) to eat the strips.<br /><br />Overall, if you don't mind the price, it's not a bad treat.

review/summary: Yorkie likes!
review/text: It can be difficult writing reviews of pet food/treats for obvious reasons and most everyone can read the nutritional information in the item description area, so I will just say that our large build 12 lb Yorkie LOVED these treats! There are a lot of times where she will tire of biscuits and seem reluctant to take them, but that was not the case with these things. When she heard either one of us messing with the packaging, she would be right there to make her presence known and show us her "puppy dog" eyes. As you bend down to hand one to her, she would jump up on her hind legs and excitedly grab it from you and run off to consume it.<br /><br />On a practical level, these things seem to be a bit pricey (as healthy foods tend to be) at about a dollar per... If you believe that your pet could benefit from these for a short period of time, then go ahead and try them. However, if your pet already seems to be in good shape, stick with what you are doing and don't over do it.<br /><br />This will not cost the product any stars, as all necessary information is provided for you to review before your purchase and the fact that our Yorkie likes them. In the future, I would buy them again to throw in a bit of variety, but not as an everyday option.

review/summary: My Picky Dog Loved These!
review/text: I have a 9lb dachshund and I didn't notice the size on these when I ordered them and they are recommended for dogs 30lbs and over.  They are large sticks that most adult dogs would eat in a few bites, but this one lasted about 30 minutes for my dog.  She loved them, begged for them and when the package was empty, knocked the trash can down to get at the wrapper which she licked clean.  These are all organic and smell wonderfully almost like cinnamon.  With a smaller dog, they do make a bit of a mess since she has to chew it slowly so put something under your pet before letting them go at it.  I think they even helps clean her teeth a bit which is a real bonus.  I am now looking for a smaller size to order for her.

review/summary: No wheat, corn, or soy - my dog loves them
review/text: First of all, these chew sticks are made in the U.S. which is a must for us when it comes to feeding our dog. Well, maybe not strictly U.S. only but definitely not China as so many dog treats come from there. I don't trust China for edible dog products and never will.  My dog Sheila usually tears through her treats in a hurry - but what we like about these is that it takes her a while to get through one. She has to work at it for a while, which is good for gum stimulation and teeth cleaning.<br /><br />We don't feed Sheila anything that has wheat, corn, or soy in it. These treats contain none of those filler ingredients. The main ingredients are rice flour and quinoa flour.  We always feed grain free food, but we make some exceptions for treats (again, as long as it is not wheat or corn).<br /><br />The cinnamon spice flavored sticks smell very pleasant and they keep Sheila busy for a while. The large size works well for her - she is about 50 lbs.

review/summary: The tails wag for this one
review/text: I assembled my canine product testing panel - Hunter, a 65 lb. Golden Retriever who has some weight issues and Boston, a 35 lib mixed breed who has some dental issues.  I offered the treats, both testers took them readily.  Boston retired to a comfortable spot and began to chew quite eagerly.  Hunter took the entire stick into his mouth which caused me some concern that he would choke on it.  I ordered him to drop the stick, which luckily he did.  I gave him back the stick but held on to one end so he could not take the whole thing in his mouth again. I kept hold of the (now slimy) stick until Hunter chewed off a couple appropriate size chunks.  Once the pieces were a safer size I let him enjoy, which he definitely did.  Boston, meanwhile, was holding the stick between his paws and chewing on it, taking off bite size pieces.  I had no concerns about how he was managing the product.  Both dogs were quite interesting in repeating the test.<br /><br />I offered the product again the following day.  Both dogs were quite eager.  Again Boston had no problem managing the product in a safe manner.  I gave Hunter the stick but retained control of one end so he could not gulp it whole.  He began to chew off a piece, and did eat the product safely.  I inspected Boston's teeth after he finished his portion and was pleased that there seemed to be some lessening in the tarter buildup on the back teeth.<br /><br />Both of my dogs liked the product, although to be fair neither is very picky.  I also offered the product to two other dogs, a 50 lib mixed breed who managed it quite readily and a 10 lb Yorkie who chewed it a bit and then buried it.  I am concerned that a larger, greedy dog like Hunter could choke on this.<br /><br />I like that the product is low calorie but I think that at nearly a dollar a stick it is a bit pricey.  I like that the sticks are hard enough to make the dogs chew.  Boston did seem to get some teeth cleaning benefits from the product.  Unfortunately due to the high price and the safety issues for Hunter I probably will not be purchasing this again.

review/summary: Great For the Older Dog
review/text: My geriatric dog Lady loves these treat sticks.  As she is getting older, 13 next March, she has had trouble gaining a few extra pounds and has some dental problems.  These treats are low fat and they are a nicely flavored spice helping with healthy choices and helping her teeth. They also help with keeping tartar down as they are not quickly consumed. She will not eat anything she doesn't like and she takes these from me very excitedly whenever they are offered.  Very pleased with this product.

review/summary: So Fido Doesn't Get Fat
review/text: I had eliminated treats from my dog's diet when she started to lose her "girlish" figure. Turns out most treats have a lot of calories. Luckily I found she loves to eat apple slices - which gives her a little variation from her regular dry food.  But since I was hoping to give her an occassional added treat I was pleased to find these sticks.  She likes them, the ingredients look fairly healthy, and I don't mind giving her one every now and then.
