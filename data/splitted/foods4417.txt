review/summary: The mint tea I bought
review/text: When I saw the mint iced tea powder on the website, I thought I would like it. But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed. It was the green tea and not sweet at all. The flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like I was expecting. I had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that I like to be similar to regular iced tea. I don't even know if I'll be using the others I had received. Sorry about this, but you did ask for my review on this.

review/summary: Bonus plants from Emerald goddess
review/text: Croton Mammy # 1<br /><br />I placed a few plant orders from Emerald Goddess Gardens around September of 2012 and they sent me a free bonus plant.<br /><br />The plant appears to be a "Croton Dwarf Corkscrew Mammy Fire 4 inch Pot" or a plant similar to it.<br /><br />This Croton is a woody stem and is about 16" high as measured from the base of the plant with the measurement not including the root ball.  The root ball is wrapped securely in plastic.  It has 24 glossy leaves.  In general, leaves are about 4 inches across the length and 1 inch in width. Leaves are richly multicolored and include the following colors: green red dark brown, yellow, red, and green.  The new leaves are green with a yellow stripe in the middle, along with yellow edgings.  When older, the leaves appear to turn green red dark brown.<br /><br />This is a very nice free plant.<br /><br />Croton Mammy # 2<br /><br />On September 28, 2012, I received another free Croton which came with another purchase I made with Emerald Goddess Gardens.<br /><br />This one measures 13" tall and has about 15 leaves.  Leaf coloration wise, it is a variation of the first plant I received.<br /><br />So, this is another nice free plant.<br /><br />Croton Mammy # 3<br /><br />On October 19, 2012, I received another free Croton from Emerald Goddess.<br /><br />The third Croton is over 13" tall and has about 23 leaves.  It has a similar pattern to the other 2 Crotons.<br /><br />It is another nice Croton.<br /><br />~~~<br /><br />Here is some general information which includes info. edited from a fact sheet from Emerald Goddess.<br /><br />1. The Croton is favored for its bright and richly colored leaves.<br />2. Plant is hardy to zones 9 or 10.  In the North, bring indoors before the night temperatures dip to 32 degrees.<br />3. Give a little sun, bright light, or light shade.  Shade is o.k., but it reduces leaf color and plant may become spindly.<br />4. You may prune 1/4 of the top in mid-Summer.<br />5. Keep a regular water schedule.  Allow soil to drain well.

review/summary: Great treat for a great toy
review/text: This flavor and the Barbecue seem to be my dog's favorite, although he does love the liver flavored one as well.  Of all the flavored cookie inserts I have tried, there has never been one that he doesn't like.  I usually put one flavor in one side of the Everlasting Treat Ball and another flavor in the opposite end.  These treats are hard and durable, allowing the dog to scrape off small portions of the cookie at a time.  It usually takes my dog a week of constant, daily chewing just to get through one cookie insert.  These cookies are the BEST!

review/summary: Depending on your dog they may last forever or for a few minutes
review/text: I have a yellow lab that destroyed the kitchen furniture when he was teething, but he is 3 years old now, and he prefers shoes. He doesn't chew on furniture anymore, but good size rawhide bones only last an hour on his paws, which is longer than these treats but not so healthy for him. He found that instead of trying to chew these hard treats out of the rubber ball, he can get them out rather easily by dropping the ball to the kitchen floor, over and over again, until they come out. Once the treats are loose (5-10 minutes later) they break easily in his powerful jaws. Note: The treats don't come out so easily when he drops the ball on the carpet, but he knows that.<br />The treats keep him entertained for half an hour, maybe longer using one treat on each side of the ball. Not perfect, but I haven't found anything better. I would have given it 5 stars if the ball had a tighter grip to hold the treats for a little longer. My dog loves the taste, and seem healthier than rawhide, but I haven't really found anything edible he doesn't like.

review/text: I bought the initial treat ball at my vet's office, and after it kept my golden busy for a LONNNNNG time I knew I had to find the refills cheaper than they sell them! She LOVES them - when she sees me get it out of the package she follows me nosing my hand trying to sneak it out of my hand. She works at them for awhile, and pops them out of the treat ball, but they still keep her busy. Would be excellant for dogs in crates.<br />:)

review/summary: My Experience  With This Treat
review/text: After reading some of these reviews, I thought I'd comment on how I use this. I have a smallish (about 22 lbs) mixed breed dog who is a strong chewer. I started using a medium sized treat ball and everlasting treats when he was about 10 months old, right after I rescued him. I use this only with the treat ball -- I would never give him a whole treat and let him eat it in one session.  I put some kibble or some small treats in the ball, with the everlasting treat only on one side.  The kibble comes out fairly easily, but slowly enough so he still has to work for it and so he still has fun. The treats are a little larger and don't come out so easily. He's learned that chewing on the treat, pressing down on the ball, enable the treats to dispense. Once the kibble or treats are gone, he chews and licks the everlasting treat. Eventually, after several weeks, he manages to consume enough so there is a hold in the center of the treat, and at that point I usually take the everlasting treat out, break it in half, and let him have it, one half at a time.<br /><br />It used to be that he would chew and lick the treat until he got bored, but he has now learned how to get the treat out. I've never actually seen him do this, so I don't know exactly how he does it, but I now take it away from him after I've decided he's had enough.<br /><br />A couple of notes:  I think the smaller treat ball was recommended for a dog his size, but I got the medium because he's such a strong chewer.  I'm glad I did, as the smaller ball wouldn't have lasted long.  I do think this is an excellent toy/treat when used the way I use it. The treat isn't particularly nutritious, but if it's consumed over a period of weeks, it shouldn't be too harmful. Also, when it's filled with kibble, the dog is working for his food and, if you're having problems with your dog eating too fast, this will slow him or her down.

review/summary: Not "everlasting"
review/text: I picked up several bento balls and large treat balls with these treats. I have a: one year old half Timber Wolf, half German Shepherd; seven year old retired bomb detection German Shepherd, 11 month old Lab/terrier mix, and 8 month old Smooth Collie. The treats were out of the balls within minutes and demolished in under 30 minutes. I had put several smaller treats into the ball as well, so after they finished the larger treats, they managed to be entertained by trying to get the small treats out. There hasn't been much that the pack hasn't been able to figure out.<br /><br />We regularly give them fresh deer bones as treats. The wolf will strip the meat while the shepherd will eat the bones, so I didn't expect these treats to be a true challenge for their jaw pressure and mental abilities. I will continue to get them and try other various tricks out. Some include putting the disc in upside down and adding peanut butter or other purees into the balls. The treats may not last long, but the balls will allow for some creative training.

review/text: We have a small dog (17 lbs) and she could not get started on these - they were too hard to bite.  Once we cut them in half (which is quite hard to do!) she was able to get at them and then really enjoyed them.  We probably wouldn't buy them again, since we were looking for something that she could work on and enjoy for a long time, and it didn't really work for that.  Either she couldn't eat it at all, or she could eat it too quickly once we cut it in half.

review/summary: Least Stinky of These Treats
review/text: First: If you don't have the ball holder, don't bother with these. They aren't really "everlasting" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a>.<br /><br />Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: These are probably the least repugnant smelling of the discs, to me, anyway. It just smells like chicken broth when the dog gets going on it. I expected the Vanilla Mint ones to be better, but have found these are the least offensive.

review/summary: The doggie equivalent of popping in a new DVD for the kids:  Silence and Peace!
review/text: I have 3 70 pound retriever mixes and they always have to have something in their mouths. Unfortunately, it is usually one of their fellow pack-mates that they wind up chewing on and the 3 of them get to scrapping like a scrum in a rugby game. Not very restful.<br /><br />However, with 3 of the large Everlasting Treat balls stuffed with these treats, I'm good for a couple of relatively peaceful evenings. Depending on the dog and the ball, the treats usually stay in there and will one two-pack will last a couple of nights. Occasionally, the treat will "pop out" of the ball and the lucky dog will be able to chew it up in about the same amount of time as a raw-hide chip.<br /><br />I like that these aren't raw-hide since raw-hide will sometimes cause digestive issues in my dogs (and there is nothing worse when 3 big dogs have digestive issues!).<br /><br />I'm so glad to see Amazon sell these because my local Petsmart no longer carries them -- at least not in the size that I need. Plus, Amazon saves me a trip, shipping, and tax... happiness abounds for bi-peds and quadra-peds alike!

review/summary: Worth every penny
review/text: This product is simply fabulous.  I purchased it for my 7 month old pit bull, who is always into something and very highly food motivated.  Prior to the everlasting treat ball her favorite toy was the Chuckle, made by Premier.  The advantage to the chuckle is that I could fill it with her food for a nutritious but fun toy.  After a few months though, she learned how to get all the food out in under 10 minutes and I needed to find something else to occupy her while I focused on other things.<br /><br />She was just a couple of pounds over 40 pounds when I purchased the treat ball.  Although the large looked too big for her, it was recommended for her size so I went with that one.  Now that I've seen her playing with it I can tell that the medium would have been too small.<br /><br />The first time she got her paws on it, she chewed on the treat for six hours straight!  I actually had to take it away from her a few times and make her drink some water because I was afraid she'd make herself sick.  The discs weren't completely gone at the end of her play-fest, they really are "everlasting."  I usually give her the treat ball with both sides covered in their treats.  Her favorite is the barbecue, but it is also the darkest and will show up on fabric.  We've tried the chicken & liver too and had positive receptions to both.<br /><br />Even after playing with this for a month I can still get a good hour to myself without having to worry about her getting in to trouble when I let her play with it.  I've also tried squeezing some cheese into the center hole for her to lick and she loves this as well!  I think peanut butter would be another excellent choice.  After about a month she has found a way to pop the treats out once in a while, but it seems to be by accident because she doesn't do it every time.  Even after she pops the treats out they still last a long time.  If she doesn't get them out herself, I pop them out when there is only a rim left and give them to her to chew on.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this toy four stars instead of five is that I wish the holes in the center were smaller to accommodate her dog food or treats.  Small/med. treats fall out too quickly.  It does seem to be sized well for their Every Flavor treats, but we haven't really tried those so I can't comment on them.<br /><br />For anyone put off by the cost, this product is TOTALLY worth its weight in gold!

review/summary: Airedale Approved
review/text: Being that I have an Airedale Terrier (over 70 lbs) I have to be very picky and harsh on products. Treats don't need to just say "long lasting", "tough", "durable" or "everlasting", they need to prove it. This flavor and product last way longer than I expected. It pops out of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a> a little sooner than I would like, but, considering I did have a hard time putting two treats in there I would have to say if they made it harder to come out I may not be able to put it in.<br /><br />The very first time one treat lasted a good five minutes, on the second attempt maybe more like four minutes and that is just because he knows how hard to bite down now. Either way with the whole package I would say it is a good investment as a once in a while kind of treat for when he does something special or we just need silence to watch a show (30 minutes to 1 hour, not a 2-hour series premier).<br /><br />My dog is pretty mellow when he has his exercise, but, when it is missed this can help to get some quiet. Though every dog, no matter the breed needs to be exercised.

review/text: My black lab mix loves these. It doesn't take very long (probably an hour or so) for him to remove the top "dome" part of the treat  and make it a flat cookie inside the blue dispenser ball. The flat part of the treat lasts another four or five days until it's just a ring inside the ball and finally the ring will take him about another week to remove and consume. He loves these things so much that I have to put refills in his ball while he is outside doing his business or I can't even get enough space in the kitchen to pop the new one in before he's trying to take it back! And even when the ball is empty he carries it around and licks around the inside of the dispenser part. I guess he's licking the smell out haha!

review/text: All of my dogs went nuts when I gave this to my 55 lb., only 5 month old, German Shepherd puppy. I have a 15 lb Bichon and a 4lb Yorkie-Poo. They were willing to (literally) walk into the Big Bad Wolf's den. So, the dogs go nuts over this. I do not. It stinks. I cannot stand the smell of it. Perhaps if you have an "outside" dog this would be fine...but, no, it would attract skunks and raccoons. You have to REALLY LOVE YOUR DOG if you are willing to put up with the smell. (bully sticks are nothing compared to these) And, to add insult to injury, the toy that I purchased with these inserts does not comply with those inserts. I would've really appreciated a heads up on that. I would have been happy to buy the truly corresponding toy.

That wasn't very "everlasting" and at nearly $4/ea it was an expensive treat. The 2nd one she took 2 - 3 days to eat, so I decided I would buy more of them as an occasional treat. My next puchase included the treat ball and a couple of other flavors (Liver and Vanilla Mint). The ball definitely helped a lot in slowing down the consumption time of the treat and she enjoys playing with it.<br /><br />Two paws up!

I installed one of each flavor on the ball and he hasn't stopped gnawing or playing with it yet!  He worked on the chicken end for over 2 hours yesterday and has yet to dislodge it from the ball, albeit he did make quite a dent in it.  Other days, he'll work on the BBQ end. So far, we're a big fan of this treat/toy combo as well as the flavor varieties available. I think I'll try the liver flavor next!

review/summary: My dog loves these
review/text: These are great treats to use with the large blue disk like things.  The disc like things are good for hiding food and then my miniature schnauzer has to work to get them out.  If I put one of these treats on top she is trying to eat this thing for hours then can't even get it all, so it lasts for a few days before I have to take the treat out so she can finish it.  But I would definitely recommend this with the large blue disk like things as a toy that keeps a dog occupied for a pretty long time.

review/summary: Everlasting Dog Treats -- Love at First Bite!
review/text: This was an instant success for our food- and treat-fussy Siberian, and our "normal" voracious Malamute.<br /><br />Pros: 1) Most importantly: If our siberian will accept (as in devour!) these treats, we predict most any other fussy pups will too.<br /><br />2) Someone intelligently designed the treat holders and shape of the treats themselves so that they can't be immediately removed and consumed... our dogs spend hours working on their treat ball. True to their breeds, our pups get in an occasional gnawing moment, but for the most part they have to lick and nibble their way through their treat. Which means when we leave for an extended time, they are honorably occupied, not bored, and not getting into mischief.<br /><br />3) The ball itself is made of a soft-ish, somewhat pliable material, and yet appears to be indestructible. Time will tell.<br /><br />4) A variety of flavors. We purchased each of the available flavors to learn which would "win", and immediately discovered that all flavors send our pups into exited expectation when they see their ball coming.<br /><br />5) You can put your own treats inside the ball itself, but it looks like a tough nut for any dog to get to.<br /><br />Con: and this could be a good thing: it's hard getting a treat into the ball unless you have strong hands/wrists, or a smooth ended spoon handle to help peel the retaining edge of the treat ball opening over the edge of the treat. This means your pup will not likely remove the treat in one lump (unless he uses that smooth spoon handle) and immediately consume it.

review/text: When used with the Everlasting Ball, these treats keep my dog busy for a long time, longer than most toys or chews.  My dog can chew through most treats within minutes, so when I need to keep him busy I give him these.  The Everlasting Ball is pretty cool, you insert smaller treats in the inside and then place the Everlasting Treats on the outside.  The dog has to work his way into the inside, and the treats hidden on the inside keep his mind exercised.

review/summary: Orange treat is better
review/text: Before I comment on the cookies. I want to inform buyers about the toy that you insert these into. Petsmart and other pet stores sell a blue ball. You stick a treat on both sides of that one. I purchased one and promptly had to return it...because on the car ride home my dog was able to get chunks of the blue plastic ripped off. I at that time decided to never purchase one of these again. However, I was recently at Pet Supplies Plus getting my sheltie groomed and I wanted to get a treat for my heavy chewer since she got left at home and was very unhappy. While browsing the treat insert toys(kong, etc) I noticed the orange ball of this that holds one cookie and small kibble or treats on the other side. I promptly dismissed it because of it being an everlasting toy. I continued to browse and when I realized that we either have or have tried pretty much every other treat stuffed toy. I decided to try it since if she ripped it apart they would refund my money and I would know if it was good or not.<br /><br />I got home and man oh man did I have a happy dog. She still has not even punctured the rough rubber. Unlike other reviewers stating that the treat came out easily in the blue ball this one did not. Once she had cleaned the middle out I could not get the treat out to save my life. I had to use a meat mallet to bust it apart. She does, however, get any kibble or other treats out of the backside very easily. We only put treats in the back when we need to get her interested again.<br /><br />Just to elaborate on the chewing power of my dog. She can eat a full rawhide in just an hour or so. (a large rawhide with the tied ends, she is 26 pounds). She has also demolished a couple of kong's and ate through the rope on the tug-a-jug toy. She also completely chewed trough the Twist-and-treat by the same company.<br /><br />The only other flaw I see with this product is the rubber. It is a lint/hair magnet. I hate picking it up and am constantly washing it because it picks up all the dog hair and lint possible...On the reverse side I love that it is not a toy that peanut butter or other semi solids work best in. I hate putting them in the kong because it leaves a very bad smell and clean up if not taken away promptly and cleaned.<br /><br />Onto the cookies. They are very hard and last her a couple hours of constant chewing. I have a large treat ball even though she is weighted into the medium. I find the oversized toys help prevent her getting a good grip and ripping it apart. She seems to love the flavor and loves when we put a new treat in. I do find them at a very good price compared to other refill treats.<br /><br />Over all I find it one of the best treat filled toy buys that we have made. It has out lasted any of the Kong's...even the black ones. It is easier to clean and provides her with a lot of enjoyment...and us with a lot of laughter as she tries to go at it.

review/summary: Last Longer if Put in Upsidedown
review/text: Ok the bad news,  these aren't the healthiest treats but if it takes ages to eat them then it doesn't matter so much. Gluten is no big deal unless u have allergies or celiacs (do dogs get that?). They do make one with rice gluten if ur dog can't do wheat.  Garlic (like onion) causes a type of anemia in dogs if given in significant amounts, low levels like in this treat or in some foods is safe but I don't like it.<br /><br />Also they don't last long if put in the way the toys show you. My dog gets it out and finishes it in less than a minute when put in right side up.<br />Upside down ( bump facing inside the ball) it takes her up to a week to finish it. I also give it to her for only like an hour or two at a time now because after a while when she had it out all the time she got bored with it. Taking it away keeps her interested. The Bento ball also works best for me.<br /><br />Chicken is likely my dogs favorite flavor. I'm surprised she likes them because she's not very food oriented. (She also likes the natural ones but hates liver.)<br /><br /> Medium is the right size for my dog she's about aussie or border collie size 35 to 40 pound. Large is actually easier for her, maybe not for other dogs.

review/summary: A Really Tough Treat!
review/text: This very solid chicken flavored dog chew may have an unusual appearance, yet it works!  Most women who see this chew in person will experience a momentary impression that it resembles, yes, I'll say it, a diaphragm.  On a serious and positive note, the round chew is challenging for dogs to grasp when the chew is concave to the floor.  Hardwood makes an excellent shuffleboard surface and my dogs kick and chase it for fun.  The exterior is somehow resistant to dog saliva, so messy floor streaks and drool spots were surprisingly absent.  My two dogs kick it, chase it and trot about the house with these very durable chews for days.  Eventually, something possesses the dogs and they start working at dismantling the 'bone'.  It literally takes hours of dedicated canine chomping and gnawing for the chew to be reduced to crumbs.  The final word is that there are no intestinal after effects in what I have observed in my two English Springers. These "Everlasting Treats" make it possible for me to sit down and watch a film in solitude. - an activity long ago lost by any 'Springer parent'.

review/text: I found the Everlasting Bento Ball and Everlasting dog treats one of the best long lasting toys I have found for my 10 lb. Bichon mix. She just loves to play, toss around and chew on the Bento Ball. It takes here weeks to chew down the middle of the treat inside.  It takes her minutes to chew down any other chewing treats like the bully sticks.  I'm not buying those any longer.  I can imagine that larger dogs would find a way to chew into one of the treats inside any of the Everlasting Treat toys very quickly.  But, for smaller dogs, this type of chew toy is ideal.

review/summary: Longest lasting dog treat I've found
review/text: This is by far one of the best dog treats I've found for my pitbull mix. She will devour a large rawhide in 30 minutes of less. These treats last for hours or days. They work best when both treat discs are placed in the ball. It takes a lot more mental work for my dog to stabilize the ball and chew on the treat. (Plus I thinks its adorable to see her use her paws like hands:) I tried to make my supply of discs last longer by only putting in one at time, which backfired because it allowed her to chew through the one disc much faster. In a true testament to this product's quality, it still took her about 4-5 hours to eat just the one. Now I use both discs and just take it away from her after a couple of hours. She loves these treats.

review/text: My dog LOVES these.  She loves to chew on things and this is the first toy that she has not destroyed within the first week.  We have had the ball that these treats insert into for over 2 months and it still is like new.  The chicken flavor appears to be her favorite so far.  They will last several days if we don't take the toy away, longer if we limit her exposure or rotate toys. She will lick and lick and chew and chew for hours.  Inserting the treats is a bit difficult but not too bad. We have not had any problems with her removing the treat as others have described, my guess is that they are not getting the treat set into the ball correctly.  This chew toy is a keeper!

review/summary: The Fifteen Minute lasting treat.
review/text: I got this for my Cairn terrier puppy when I first got him and I have to say, the idea is a good one but execution is poor. There are two basic problems with this toy.<br /><br />1) My dog just licks it until the treat gets smaller and then manages to pull it out and finish it. This takes maybe fifteen minutes at most.<br /><br />2) Even if he didn't do that, after about three uses the rubber became loose around the treat, so that now it basically just pops out by itself.<br /><br />So save your money and invest it in something more durable.

He plays with it on and off for about a week before it's finally devoured.  It's really cost effective for us and we're happy knowing he won't break the treat ball and swallow non-food parts.

review/summary: Great Product, but it isn't so everlasting...
review/text: my dogs LOVE this treat. They also love the fact that they have to work to get it out but they get it out of the plastic cover in less than 10 Min!! I have three Jindo dogs and they are all about 55-60 lbs. I know they're smart but i just didn't think it would take them so quickly to figure out how to get this treat out. I will probably continue to buy it for them but I was a little disappointed that it didn't last longer.

review/text: Both of our dogs love this particular flavor and the everlasting ball as a whole.  It keeps them entertained for a good amount of time. Specifically, our Husky-Chow dog devours treats within minutes if not seconds.  This last longer than any raw-hide or bully stick. Definitely would recommend for dogs that love chewing things.

review/text: My pup can chew up any rawhide chew pretty quick.  After gnawing on this for an hour it was still just mostly scrached up.  However, after that she lost interest in it and never did finish it. Not sure if it lost its flavor or what.

review/text: First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!

review/summary: Cinnamon Spice
review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.

On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else.

review/text: I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.

review/text: We make couscous about once a week, so it helps to have a lot around.  We're not that picky with the quality of the couscous (since most of the flavor comes from other added ingredients) but I have to say that this brand really is very flavorful.  Both the plain and the tri-color actually add to the overall flavor of whatever dish we use it in.  Best of all, this bulk buy saves us a little money over buying the small boxes at the grocery store.

review/text: This is a very tasty collection of couscous, and a great value if you can get it on one of the Amazon sales. All the varieties are good, but I find the whole wheat to be the best - more of a "hearty" taste. The tomato and tri-colored are nice in that they add some visual interest to the plate, but the tomato and other flavors are very subtle (if you can taste them at all).<br /><br />The containers have a wide mouth so it's easy to scoop out what you need. Stores easily on the shelf.

review/summary: Shipping was fast, but product was very stale!
review/text: I recently purchased these based on the reviews posted.  They arrived quick, but when they got here they were extremely stale and filled with hard bits.  I contacted the seller but they have not responded, I am not impressed.

review/summary: Caramel Lovers Will Really Like This One
review/text: I don't like caramel and this version didn't change my mind.  But the guys I work with claim caramel is a guy thing and the women are all about chocolate.<br /><br />I bought the Apple Flavor, the Celtic Sea Salt version, and the assorted bag of this caramel to share with the men I like.<br /><br />Most of the men liked this one (Apple) the best.  They said it tasted like a candied apple, the state fair, and Halloween.  I thought it tasted like caramel.<br /><br />The Celtic Sea Salt version was the least favorite.  One thought it was too salty, one said it tasted less sweet, I thought it tasted like caramel.<br /><br />One said the Chocolate version was the best.<br /><br />My husband said the chipolte version was best with a slow, pleasant afterburn. That was the only one I kind of liked.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I bought Emily's Cashews as a gift.  The cashews were peanut sized, bland, with many broken.  I wouldn't buy them again.  Luckily, this was only part of the gift.  I really would have been embarrassed if this was all that he received.  Especially as I had it sent directly to his home.  Phewy.

review/summary: Sweet 'N Low - Still a Favorite After 40 Years
review/text: Sweet 'N Low has been a staple in our family ever since a member of the family controlled his diabetes with diet starting in 1964. While it's a great substitute for sugar, it was never a great product for baking. For baking, use Splenda. That, according to the bakers in the family. The only thing I've ever baked are chocolate chip cookies from Pillsbury, so don't take my word for it. We've used it pretty much for coffee and tea only over the years<br /><br />Some people will say that Sweet 'N Low has an aftertaste though I've never found that to be the case.<br /><br />Btw, six months ago, the 1500 packet package was $4 less then today, and two years ago it was $2 cheaper than that. Cheaper to buy the "two-pack" (3,000). Just keep it stored in a dry place. It doesn't go bad.<br /><br />I'm probably the typical non-diabetic user. It's psychological. With my cookie, I can have coffee with Sweet 'N Low instead of sugar. In fact, I might be able to have two cookies.
