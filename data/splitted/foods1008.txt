review/summary: I love this yogurt!!
review/text: I love the creamy texture. I use it in place of sour cream on baked potatoes and in recipes.  I blend it with frozen fruit, whey protein and juice in a smoothie and have it for lunch and/or breakfast.  I am always amazed at how good it tastes and how long it stays with  me.<br /><br />The only issue I have is how it was packed for shipment. It was in a box with styrofoam around it and a few ice packs that were totally thawed. It arrived at room temperature to my house with no exterior notification as to what was inside or that it needed to be refrigerated.  I was not home when it arrived and my husband just set the box on the table, where it sat for several more hours til I arrived home. ??<br /><br />All in all I am happy to find a source for this yogurt since I am in rural America and my grocery stores don't carry this brand. I just hope they can find a better way to cold pack it for shipping.

review/summary: Only the Best Butter in the World - Anchor Butter from New Zealand!
review/text: Growing up in Southeast Asia, we had easy access to New Zealand's Anchor butter for everyday consumption. Moving to the States as an adult, I found the butters here tasteless. I thought it was just a change in my tastebuds, but when I was able to get Anchor butter again, I did a simple taste test and realized that the high quality flavour of the NZ butter was real!  I have tried all kinds of butter here - organic and not, even butters imported from France, Ireland, Germany, etc. Nothing - NOTHING - comes close to the fresh taste of New Zealand's Anchor Butter, which has hints of clover and something really special that's hard to describe!  The NZ government has very strict regulations for its cows and all, and these cows graze upon meadow grasses - you can taste it in the butter!<br /><br />So if you're reading this and getting curious - don't waste another second - order yourself some real Anchor Butter. You won't regret it, and you won't look back!

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: I've always preferred butter to other spreads. I lived in New Zealand almost 7 years. New Zealand butter is the best I've ever had. I've tried others available in gourmet stores, but have never had anything better. After moving back to the U.S., I started buying it in bulk and freezing it. I was really spoiled in New Zealand when it was readily available! When I first got some after being back in the U.S. for several years, my daughter pulled a Paula Deen and ate it strait off a plate. I've seen the happy cows and happy cows = awesome butter. Now if I could just get some New Zealand triple cream brie in the U.S.... New Zealand butter is the most prized commodity in my kitchen.

review/summary: Perfect food for my old cat
review/text: I'm porting this over from the "blue" pouch.<br /><br />My cat has "put up" with canned cat food and other pouches for years. Her rejection of all would be evident on my carpets if I didn't have every carpet cleaning device known to man.<br /><br />She only likes the gravy and when she actually eats something solid, it's a great day. When I brought this food home from Petco she ate two pouches down to the bottom of the bowl within a few hours.<br /><br />Since then, I've bought most other Soulistic flavors and she eats them all.<br /><br />I'm sold enough on this product to order it from Amazon because when I go to my Petco they're sold out. A wasted trip is worth the shipping for me.<br /><br />My cat gives it 5 stars.

review/summary: My cats' favorite
review/text: My cats only get wet food as a surprise treat every once in awhile, but they've still managed to develop tastes. They no longer eat pate style wet food, only things in gravies. I usually get them something different to try when I pick a can, just to compare and see, and since it will only be a small part of their diet it won't shock their system to change it up. One of my cats--darling that she is--stuck her face in the middle of a bowl of pumpkin puree when I had my back turned during the making of a pumpkin pie and went crazy for it, so when I saw this pumpkin food I thought I'd give it a try. Both my cats love it, and I love that it's grain free. They like other flavors from this line as well, but still won't eat pates and are iffy about the gelee ones, too.

review/summary: My Picky, Picky, PICKY Dog Loves Chewnola
review/text: I have small-medium size Schipperke/Chihuahua who's ultra picky with his food and treats.  The first time I bought Chewnola was at a store and it was the only bone-like treat they had.  Despite the dog's pickiness, I bought a pack out of sheer desperation.  He's been crazy about these Chewnola bones since day one.  My dog isn't just picky, he's a hyper-active, major chewer with razor-like teeth in the front who bores easily.  One Chewnola keeps him completely occupied for hours, mopre than any other type of bone I've given him.  One of my cats seems to enjoy the taste and he takes the treat from the dog.  The cat will lick it until it's taken back by the dog (I do have a video of that).  I highly recommend Chewnola to anyone with any type of dog, especially picky ones.  Some 411 - I order these from Amazon because, even with shipping, I save a lot of money on this item - in the store it cost double.

review/text: We saw these at the store, and decided to try them for our mini Aussie. She LOVES them! They're rolls of rawhide filled with peanut butter, with granola on the outside, and she will spend hours chewing on them. The only thing I would warn anyone about is they can be quite messy. She makes a mess on herself AND the floor, so be prepared for that, but I definitely would recommend them as a healthy chewable treat that cleans their teeth :)

Sometimes I use it as a moisturizing sealant. As for the skin, the moisture lasts the entire day! I wouldn't apply it to the face though--especially if you have acne issues. It's a little heavy...<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this product and will probably be buying more of this. I gave it a 4/5 because I don't really like the smell of coconut--this one just happens to be really strong.

review/text: i have purchased just about every coconut oil brand out there and find garden of life to be the best. other less expensive brands often leave an odd aftertaste or chemical residue even if they claim to be organic. i find this product to be consistently clean tasting. have been taking daily for over a year and have noticed improvement in skin, energy, immune system, and clarity of thought/memory. after initially feeling resistant to the idea of eating fat, i can't imagine life without this product. no weight gain at up to 3 tablespoons a day. don't let the medical establishment's misunderstanding about saturated fats scare you into not using this product. i have only benefited from it after years of low fat eating that was slowly destroying my health. but do start slowly, its not uncommon to feel a little nauseous( apparently as a result of being unused to digesting fats) or to have looser bowels initially( it has been used as a laxative).......

review/summary: Great for Skin and Hair
review/text: I use this as a hair and scalp oil.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny. There's no greasy or residue buildup. It absorbs right into the hair and scalp,  If you apply to your hair, wait few minutes and then run your fingers through your hair, there will be no residue on your fingers--none.  Your hair will feel soft, supple, and look shiny.  A previous reviewer said she uses it on her skin. I do too. I usually put in on my face before bed.  Just like she said, it absorbs right into your skin and there is no residue.<br /><br />I started using it because my mom has uses it.  But, I never knew much about it.  I did an online search to find out more about this oil.  According to the information I got, with regular use, Coconut oil can help reverse sun damage and reduce signs of aging on your face and neck.  The article also said it helps eliminate "liver spots"  The reason given was that coconut oil breaks down so fast that it really does absorb into the layers of your skin, instead of just sitting on the surface like so many face creams and lotions do.  It is good for the skin. I'm 50, and my skin is holding up pretty well.  I have very few "liver" spots near my ears, but absolutely none on my forehead and cheeks.  A lot of people have a whole face full of them by the time they are my age.  It is a healthy oil to consume.  It is solid, but it breaks down so easily in the body that the liver(the real organ) doesn't have to even get involved in the breaking down process, like it does with most fats we consume.  It's a shame, I always thought this was one of the worst oils you could eat.  Turns out, it's one of the best oils to consume.  If you do an online search, you can find a lot of information about the many benefits of coconut oil by an MD. You can even find out how it got it's bad reputation,

The main uses have been for our dog (added a couple tablespoons to her food to help her skin), our dry skin, and even "intimate" moments (it's better than anything else we have tried).  Since coconut oil is a natural ingredient, hypoallergenic and antibacterial, it's perfect for inside and outside of our bodies (except perhaps, for eyes and ears).  My husband has eczema and it's been one of the most helpful products we have found.

I like this product because it is extra virgin meaning it is the least processed and the most purest oil. It keeps the scalp moisturized so the scalp does not itch or get dandruff. I really like using this on my hair especially after washing while I air dry my hair. I used my first bottle and I just ordered another. It also has a light refreshing smell and not overpowering at all. Coconut Oil is a great product for hair, it also makes the hair shiny too. I recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy hair and scalp.

TIP: if you melt shea butter and add coconut oil to it and put it freezer overnight(so it won't be grainy) it will stay softer, i think because the coconut oil is not as solid as the shea. Also i use some coconut oil in my rice, sooo good.

review/summary: Great
review/text: I've been using this for multiple purposes - for hair and skin care, and for cooking. Makes my hair really soft and soaks in nicely, and even though I have never had particularly rough skin, I am noticing a difference with softness. For cooking, I don't know exactly how well it's working - it's supposed to boost metabolism and promote energy, but I've only been taking it for a week so I haven't really noticed. But one thing's for sure, it's a lot healthier than cooking with butter...

review/summary: Haven't used it for cooking but if it's as good as it is in toiletries...
review/text: This product has a host of books and reviews about its benefits to folks when consumed in place of other oils, but I don't use it for cooking.  It's my all-in-one cosmetic.  I use it to condition my hair (pre-wash, or use a little on the ends of hair after wash), moisturizer, make-up remover, and couldn't be happier.  It's so inexpensive next to all the other things I used to use, that now don't take up all that room in my bath.  I cannot speak highly enough about it as a beauty aid.  No more facial moisturizers, make-up removers, eyelash conditioner, body moisturizer, and hair treatments.  All-in-one, and perfect at all of it.  Then there's the smell of summer that it leaves on you and in your hair.  Gorgeous, I feel like there's a little piece of the Hamptons on me.  Only one thing wrong - if you're not looking to tan or burn be careful in the sun, it's an oil, folks.  Also, it's liquid in high heat, so pack it well in your suitcase.  Use a baggie over it, just in case.

The burning stopped and minimized the peeling. IDK about all the other health properties/uses people rave about though. Oh and it solidifies rather easily.

review/text: I contacted the seller about my concerns of ordering 3 jars and having the possibility of them breaking. On arrival, there were no damages. Excellent customer service, quick arrival. The product is great, I gifted one to a friend who uses it for eczema. It smells great too! tried it on my face but it ended up breaking me out for a week so I think I'll start using jojoba oil instead to moisturize/clean out pores on my face. This coconut oil is great for the rest of the body and eating/mixing in green tea.

I have coconut oil in small glass jars in all my bathrooms labeled for body so I know I can hand dip. I use this in my stainless steel pans prior to cooking pretty much anything. I use it in brownie mixes and pancake mixes... anything. LOVE IT.<br />I will most likely never switch to another brand. I like what I like and I'm sticking with it :)

review/summary: Good So Far - Garden of Life Coconut Oil
review/text: Just received my Garden of Life Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. I've used it to fry apples mixed with lemon, a little bit of sugar, delicious vanilla (also ordered from Amazon.com) and cinnamon - delicious! I tried some on my skin, my hair (which felt silky afterwards) - going coconuts with it! It melts immediately upon contact with the skin. I like that the fragrance is subtle and not overpowering like fake me out coconut fragrances are. So far I am happy with my purchase. I will continue to experience cooking with this oil as well as using on my skin and hair. Try it, I think you'll like it!

review/summary: Simply delicious and healthy too!
review/text: I love this oil.<br /><br />My first attraction to it was based upon my research which led me to the realization that unrefined organic coconut oil is healthy for you.  So many reports about the dangers of coconut oil were based on poorly the poorly refined kind.<br /><br />No trans fatty acids here!<br /><br />It has anti-bacteria and anti-fungal properties.<br /><br />Two books on the use of coconut oil are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0941599604">Coconut Cures: Preventing and Treating Common Health Problems with Coconut</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049">The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)</a>, both by Bruce Fife.  Both are good, but if I were to choose between the two, I would go with Coconut Cures which has the recommended therapeutic amount of coconut oil to injest on a daily basis.  The Coconut Oil Miracle has the recommended amount of coconut oil if you are ill (high dosage amount).<br /><br />This oil is so fresh and clean tasting that I happily eat it raw.<br /><br />I also cook with it, make homemade popcorn in the stockpot and you can't taste the coconut flavor.<br /><br />I also rub it on my skin.<br /><br />This is a fantastic all which has many uses!

I don't like much that it comes in a plastic jar, I'm not very fond of plastic, but also this it was a good idea, because a glass jar would have weighted more & is more exposed to damaging along the way. Anyways, I transferred the oil right away in glass jars. I wish I could buy it in my area, but I can't find here a brand as good as this one.

review/text: This is real coconut oil. The smell is not too strong and the oil is pure goodness. I think its suitable for cooking or other none culinary uses. I like that the container is glass bc I need to melt the cococut over and over  before using it (so no worries about plasticisers migrating in the oil). The only thing is that i would like to see coconut oil jars with smaller openings to avoid having dirt go in it.

review/summary: Good Quality Coconut Oil
review/text: I bought this brand of coconut oil strictly for beauty, bodily purposes.  It works quite well as an overall face and body moisturizer, although I use it primarily as a lip treatment during these cold, dry winter months.  It's still in solid form due to the cold weather in my area, but I've just been taking small chunks of it and allowing it to melt in my hands for a few seconds or so before applying to skin.  As others users have noted, I've found this oil to have a toasty-like smell which I don't mind so much.  I might try the Nutiva brand next time because I've heard it has a nicer smell.  In the near future I'll probably purchase more coconut oils just for cooking/baking purposes.  I give this brand an A.

review/text: I purchased this product yesterday and eat a teaspoonful (tasted like a tasteless oil and after I swallowed it, the after taste was coconuty and pleasant) I gave a small amount to my daugher also. She has cornrow braids so I greased her scalp with the coconut oil because I heard this is also good for the hair. I greased my whole hair and slap with the oil. Today my hair feels softer then before so I am happy with my purchase. The benefits are numerous. I will start cooking with it this weekend.

review/summary: Great for cleaning face, bursitis, joint pain
review/text: Amazon's delivery is super fast.  This stuff is wonderful and smell like the real coconut! Reminds me of the tropics.  I ordered 4 jars of this EVCO and gave some to my mom to try.  She loves it.<br /><br />I have been using EVCO for about a month now and I am very HAPPY with it. I take about 1 TBLSP/day internally; put in my coffee, spread it on my toast.  No only is my enery level up, the pain from my shoulder bursitis is gone. Since I have been taking EVCO, I haven't have to take my medication for my bursitis and joint pain.<br /><br />This is also great to clean my face with at night followed by warm damp cloth.  It makes my skin so soft. I have combination skin and have always been afraid to put anything heavy and oily on my face due to acne breakouts.  I even give some to my dogs and cats and their hair is shiny and soft. This stuff works great!

review/summary: Love it...love it...love it!!!
review/text: I am now officially a fan of coconut oil!!! I was a bit sceptical at first, but this stuff really is awesome. My wife and I have a jar in our bedroom and use it primarily for skin lotion, but have also used it as a massage oil and as an intimate lubricant(works great...edible too!). We also have a jar in our baby's room and have used it to cure diaper rash and dry skin. The best thing about applying coconut oil to your baby's skin is that it's natural and edible, so you don't have to worry about it getting on their hands, which also means in their mouth. And you don't have to worry about what chemicals you're rubbing into your baby's skin.<br /><br />Like the other reviews have stated, this stuff is solid below 76 degrees and a liquid at or above 76 degrees. As a solid, it's a bit gritty at first, but almost immediately melts in your hand. Also, i'm amazed by how little you actually need....a tiny bit goes a long way. The first time I gave my wife a massage with this, I ended up putting on way too much and ended up wiping a bunch off with a towel. I also stained the sheets that night, but I think it came out after a few washes. BTW, the scent is a very light coconut scent...i'm not a big fan of coconut smell to begin with, but this doesn't bother me in the least.

I made my own concoction of 100% pure oils, sweet almond, jojoba, castor, coconut, shea butter, and alittle  neem oil. A few dabs on the scalp is plenty, then massage it in. This mixture is just as great on the skin, extremely moisturizing. Neem oil has a very pungent smell so if you decide to use this formula just a drop or two will suffice. I'm definitely sold on this product! &#9733;HAPPY TO BE NAPPY&#9733;

review/summary: Tastes Great
review/text: I'm not a coconut oil savant, but I got this for my stovetop popcorn popper and it's awesome.  It's not super-greasy, very light, cooks the popcorn to perfection and leaves an amazing hint of coconut without the sweetness (although my husband says it doesn't get the coconut hint, but he misses a lot of hints).  It shipped quickly, was well-packaged, and is a good price, I didn't want to buy a ton in case we didn't like it.

review/text: Great tasting. It isn't overwhelming. I have used it on my hands, and after a couple minutes it is absorbed and doesn't leave me feeling greasy. I will be ordering more as soon as I can. I don't think the 16 oz jar is going to last long.<br /><br />The math is wrong the 16 oz jar isn't 26 cents an ounce more like 55 cents an ounce. I wasn't buying it based on price, I was bought it based on reviews. This had the best reviews and I now know why. I am glad that it came in a glass jar, after talking to my friends, the plastic containers will alter the taste of the oil. So for a pure tasting coconut oil, I wanted to make sure the one I got came in a glass container.

review/summary: I like it!!!
review/text: I did research on the benefits of coconut oil and the skin how it absorbs easily and that it makes an ideal ointment for the relief of dry, rough and wrinkled skin and it's good for psoriasis and eczema suffers. I am brown skinned and I'm 47 and have good skin most people NEVER guess I'm 47 -- but I thought if this is good, it will preserve skin. Well, when I first put it on, my face felt like a baby's bottom, it seems to absorb well and I noticed my skin is even softer, and it does seem to have a "glow" --But I must admit after this absorbs my skin needs a little extra moisturizer (perhaps because it's getting colder) but I will follow up with a shea lotion.

review/text: I use this oil in alot of things, even in making pie crust. It will make things taste like coconut, but we like that flavor. Also good in cookies as it makes them crunchy and a nice texture. I would not recommend using this for Chinese stir-fry however. Try this oil in cookies with the M&M coconut flavored type and add some regular chocolate chips with it!

review/summary: Great coconut oil
review/text: This is the first coconut oil I tried. It is great. Great taste, great smell, great consistency. With all the brands out there, it can be hard to pick one to start with. Somehow I went with Garden of Life and it worked out great. Ive also had Nutiva, which a lot of people use and can be found for a bit cheaper. You can buy a gallon tub from the direct website for cheaper. So shop around on Amazon and other sites once youve selected the brand you want.<br /><br />Coconut oil, youve heard all the great things it does. Here are some things that hopefully persuade you more:<br /><br />Ive found that when refrying leftovers, such as chinese food or meatballs, it actually IMPROVES the flavor over the original. With coconut oil, you can avoid microwaving, which does alter the taste and texture, and some say destroys nutrients and adds toxins. Just stir fry with coconut oil and enjoy your delicious leftovers!<br /><br />It may serve as a bit of a replacement for vanilla in baking. The main purpose of vanilla is to add flavor. Unfortunately, the vanilla we had at home had the dreaded CORN SYRUP in it (READ YOUR LABELS). I looked online and it appeared that it could be omitted anyway, but as it turned out, coconut oil appears to provide that underflavor. Add a hint of coconut to your baking!<br /><br />Yes, coconut oil can be much more expensive than regular oil, but you cant and shouldnt cook with olive oil. Almost every other oil is bad (soybean, canola, corn) or just not as good (butter). Think of it as an investment in your future. I know people who arent of strong financial means that would be hard pressed to give up their "coco" as I call it.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: In the '70s there was an herbal tea that I really loved from South Africa, but then came the boycott of South African goods and I could never again find it. Recently I did some research and found that the tea was once again available (though not by the brand name I knew) by the actual name of the tea "Rooibos".<br /><br />So I made an order through Amazon... and although the shipping price is a bit high for something so light in weight, I can't complain because the tea is even better than I remember it. For those who aren't familiar with Rooibos Tea, it is very similar to good Black tea in flavor, minus the bitter after taste and minus the caffeine and tannic acid, but with the anti-oxidants and other GOOD stuff. Refreshing and delicious stuff!

review/text: My star rating is not a reflection on the seller. They were fantastic and quick in processing my order.<br /><br />I am quite fond of rooibos tea from South Africa, which is the only location where GENUINE rooibos tea should come from, FYI. The brand, however, tastes crap. I've gone through about 10 or 12 bags, hoping that it was a fluke. Sadly, it's not. It doesn't taste anything like any rooibos tea I've ever had in my lifetime. In fact, I know this is marketed as the #1 tea company in South Africa. Honestly, though, I had never heard of this brand. Twig and Ouhuis seemed to be pretty popular brands. Of course, most people in SA buy this tea loose.<br /><br />In terms of mass marketing, this would probably be on par with Red Rose brand tea here in the States in terms of quality.<br /><br />I hope this helps!

I should add that I'm English and black tea with milk is one of my daily necessities. I drink my Rooibos tea the same way. I found the smell a little odd at first - reminiscent of antiseptic (some say vanilla) and wet straw - but I liked the taste immediately. Rooibos tea has all the robust attributes of black tea but without the caffeine, and it is supposed to be very healthy. It's also refreshing. If you like black tea, give it a try!

review/summary: Rooibos is my choice for iced tea
review/text: I'm an iced tea drinker year round, and I go thru tons of the stuff during hot weather.  Rooibos is naturally decaf and has a mild unobtrusive taste.  I find my palate doesn't get tired of the stuff, which is key during those high volume hot days.<br /><br />I've tried a number of brands of Rooibos and Freshpak wins hands down.  Don't even bother with other brands.<br /><br />My iced tea recipe:<br /><br />Boil water for 6 liters of final product with 8 Rooibos tea bags.  During this process I add 1/3 cup Splenda and 1/3 cup real sugar.  After it reaches a boil, I shut it off and let it cool down (tea bags still in the liquid).  After it's cool I add the juice of one healthy lemon.  Pour the contents into 6 plastic liter bottles (used seltzer water bottles in my case) and stick them in the reefer.
