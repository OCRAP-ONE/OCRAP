review/summary: For discerning tea drinkers
review/text: I was first introduced to Wissotsky Earl Grey Tea by a friend from Russia. It has a mellow, but full-bodied taste and a delightful aroma. I love it!The Bergamot oil in the tea is from a ciris fruit that grows in the Mediterranean. It is shipped through Israel, so it is not always easy to find. Stores with Eurasian products sometimes carry it. But it is easier to order it through Amazon. I enjoy this brand of Earl Grey over other brands. I also like to give a box to other tea enthusiasts who have not tried it yet. If you love to try different kinds of Black teas, you definitely want to try Wissotsky Earl Grey Tea. And if you don't have time to look for a store that carries it, you want to order it from Amazon.

review/summary: My old favorite
review/text: I love this tea not only because I grew up in Israel, but also because it tastes like a very authentic Earl Grey. The only drawback is the packaging - it's wrapped in individual paper packages, so it doesn't stay fresh long enough as in foil packages, the way the "Bigelow" does it.

review/text: I have always loved Earl Grey tea in any brand, but Wissotsky brand is the best I have had and well worth the extra cost.  I save this as a treat for myself.  Although I have been able to find regular Wissotsky tea in the grocery store I have not found Earl Grey.  I now purchase my teas from Amazon, getting free delivery with a prime membership and the tea is always fresh.

review/summary: This is a fabulous and super healthy bread!
review/text: I have it every day for breakfast: toast a piece on high, once ON EACH SIDE. It won't be burned just very flavorful--this is the way to develop the wonderful healthful nutty flavor in this bread. Then butter lightly (optional), sprinkle with Splenda or sweetener of choice. Spread with Neufchatel (light cream cheese) or nice organic peanut butter. It is fabulous. It should be quite warm when you sample your first bite. You won't believe how much better it tastes this way. 7 grams of fiber per slice and low carbs. (That is 1/3 of the total fiber most Americans eat, and you need the addition.) Enjoy!

Those four have sprouted well, but the sunflower seeds still have their hulls.<br /><br />Therefore, when sprouting these sunflower seeds, each sprout has to be removed from its hull to be eaten.  It would be better to buy hulled sunflower seeds for sprouting and not to use these.

review/summary: Just not very good.
review/text: I suppose you get what you pay for... but I really was expecting this chocolate to be at least decent. Instead, the chocolate outside is almost rubbery in texture, the various fillings are each more grainy than the last, and both components are almost entirely flavorless. It's as if someone tried to create a new type of plastic, made entirely from cheap sugar. I'm still eating as I type this review, hoping against hope that the first few were just a little odd, but honestly it's just getting worse and worse. My teeth hurt, there is an odd aftertaste, and I can't stop shooting disappointed glances at the now half-empty box... which, by the way, is entirely too big for the number of tiny chocolates contained inside. I suppose they were trying to make it look more impressive from the outside, as if it contained more, but instead it just adds one more level of disappointment to the experience.<br /><br /> What will I do with the remaining 4.5 boxes? I can only hope some unlikeable relatives have birthdays soon.

review/summary: Excellent Tea, Good Price
review/text: I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle. I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace' brand Oolong.<br /><br />After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.<br /><br />What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.<br /><br />I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the 'Tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />Ken

review/text: My local pet store carries braided bully stix but they are fairly pricey. When I saw this pack of 6 for $11 and some change, I thought it would be a steal as the price would be about less than half per stick as at the pet store. It takes my little guy a couple days to work through one braided stick so I thought this was an excellent price and last me probably 3-4 weeks.<br /><br />The stix arrived on time and the package was very nice but I disappointed to find that they are not the hard bully stix. They are pretty soft and more like a jerk treat or something. My dog blasted through each of them in a matter of seconds. So unfortunately this was a waste of money for me as they were not at all what I expected.<br /><br />I can't actually complain about the product but just be aware that these are more like treats and if you're looking for something to keep your dog busy for a while, this is not the right treat.

review/summary: The very best!
review/text: These are the best strained tomatoes I have come across and very conveniently priced for the quality and taste. Think about how expensive organic tomatoes are and how many go into a 24 oz bottle! Not only are these organic, they taste so good. I've tried many different pasta sauces (quality, organic ones from Whole Foods) and none compare with this pure tomato paste. Just add heavy cream and you have an excellent pasta sauce (it is very, very good with Severino hand-nested egg based papardelle). Maybe storing the paste in a glass jar prevents metals from leaching into it and changing the taste? Thank you to the people at Bionaturae for this great product.

review/summary: Arrived Late and Broken
review/text: This 6-pack of jarred strained tomatoes took two weeks to arrive, even though I ordered by Prime, and two jars were broken.  The box was a complete mess.  Despite being extremely careful I still cut myself twice trying to extricate the unbroken bottles.  I called customer service, reached a phone tree in which I eventually heard the recording that I would have to email them, that they had requested, since broken glass was all over my floors and sink/disposal and labels were now unreadable.  They refunded me for the two jars, supposedly, haven't actually seen that yet.  The only good thing is they use jars for this particular product and not toxic plastic-lined cans, or plastic jars.  I will just have to drive the extra 20 minutes to Trader Joe's for their jarred tomatoes from now on. Taste of the sauce was fine, nothing spectacular.

review/summary: Amazing product, but don't buy it from here!!
review/text: After searching for YEARS for just a plain tomato sauce in a jar, I came across these in my local grocery store and was thrilled. The quality is outstanding. And making a fantastic, delicious sauce only takes minutes and a few ingredients. On the jar it gives a very simple recipe for making your own pasta sauce--just add garlic, salt and basil. Of course you can add as many things as you like, but we like simpler tasting pasta sauce. If you can get these in a store near you, I highly recommend it. Do NOT buy from here! I can get them at my grocery store for 2.89 per jar. So it is a complete rip off that they are selling these for over $6 a jar!! I am hoping that by adding another positive review, Amazon will see that people like the product and may eventually offer subscribe and save on it.

review/summary: Finally - just tomatoes
review/text: When I had to restrict my diet (eliminating things like citric acid, citrus, sugar cane, and corn) I did not expect canned tomatoes to be a casualty.  Tomatoes are tomatoes, right?  After reading many labels, including organic manufacturers like Muir Glen, I was terribly disappointed that my tomato consumption would be limited to the summer season.<br /><br />Bionaturae's strained tomatoes are just tomatoes.  Finally!  The taste is excellent and glass bottle makes it easy to use any amount and store the rest for another recipe.  Because canned tomato products need to be stored in a separate container I found myself using a lot more than I needed or none at all.  With Bionaturae's jar I pour what I need and pop it in the fridge.  So simple.  I've used it for pizza sauce and marinara with excellent results.<br /><br />I've tried several of Bionaturae's products and have been pleased with each.

The garlic is subtle enough even for those who do not care for garlic that much, like my kids.  They are crunchy but not too hard, and they do not have that stale crunchy taste like most other brands of croutons. I highly recommend them.

review/text: I've always been on the quest for the perfect salad, and that includes the perfect ingredients. For me, these are the perfect croutons. I've tried just about every brand out there, and that includes restaurant quality freshly made croutons. And the secret is simply that these are made and shipped fresh as quickly as possible. As a result, they don't last as long as other shelf stable croutons, but the taste difference is out of this WORLD. When I'm buying for my salads, this brand is the only one I even bother with anymore. They don't always have them at my local store, so I started buying them here. In bulk, for this price, it's cheaper than the best store bought brands. Try them just once, and I think you'll be hooked. You won't be disappointed.<br />  Thanks for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell

I can also confirm what the other person said about being "mushy," but I much prefer the texture of these to the regular gummies.  I would describe them as softer and tender.  But if you like the harder, more chewy version, you might not like these.<br /><br />I read in another spot someone complaining because they are yellowish instead of clear like they seem in the picture.  They are indeed slightly yellow (very pale) and not clear. So, if you are buying them as a decoration, beware!<br /><br />The only problem I have with them is not eating the entire bag in one sitting.

She still voom-voom-vooms around at a pace that makes me exhausted.  She loves toys, especially stuff she chases.  So the bubbles are great full.  Especially since they are catnip bubbles.  You don't have the worry about them getting soap on them and making them sick.  She love jumping high to pop them.<p>So if you are looking for something to awaken the kitten in your kitty, you might try these.

review/summary: Really works well.
review/text: I wanted a safe bubble product for my year old cats. I researched the various "pet" bubbles and decided on this one based on product size, cost, and reviews.  I received in timely manner in a well packaged box with clear plastic covering the entire bottle.  Naturally I smelled the product and did detect a slight spicy scent but a bit of a cleaning product smell as well.  The bubble wand is standard as pictured.  The bubbles produced are sized from 1" to about 3" in diameter.  Just the right size for kitties to play with.  They last a substantial amount of time without bursting and do not leave behind any residue that I have detected.  I use them on an outside wood porch.  Compared to store brand bubbles these are a bit pricey but find these are some of the best bubbles I have ever purchased and worth the price. Also, the ad states the size is 4 oz. but the bottle states it is 5 oz.  I think this one bottle will last throughout the summer and fall season being used for a few minutes each day.  My kitties loved playing with these and sometimes required hitting the bubble a couple of times before they burst.  My one complaint is that this product is distributed by United Pet Group, Inc. in Ohio but the bottle states this product is made in China.  I consider this product worth the cost and would definitely make a repeat purchase but will research for a product made in the USA first.

review/summary: Trippy, man.
review/text: My two cats were very interested when I opened the package, very interested in the wand, but when I blew the bubbles, they panicked and ran under the furniture. It took a few minutes for them to work up the nerve to come out and investigate, and they are still wary of touching or being touched by the bubbles, but they LOVE to watch. They investigate spots where the bubbles touched the floor, they maneuver around for the best spot to see the bubbles fall, and if I close the bottle and put it away too soon, they try to pull it off the shelf themselves.<br /><br />A previous reviewer brought up doubts about the authenticity of the catnip extract, but I suspect her kitty may be a connoisseur. This may not be the good stuff, but the bubbles are now off-limits in my apartment after 7:00pm because fifteen minutes after bubbletime, my duo start ricocheting off walls.<br /><br />As for how the humans like it, I've experienced no staining of furniture or rugs, but the smell IS pungent and will stick around. Whatever scented candle you use to cover the cat smell should do the trick.

There is a slight smell, but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip...

review/summary: Bubbles go WHEE! (aka catnipcatnipCATNIP!eeee floaty)
review/text: I have two active kitties, both love to run top speed around the apartment (daily), chase mylar balls, hunt bugs and jump after things. .. and of course, like catnip.  My boy cat, Boo, is a bit pickier about what he plays with and looses interest after 10 or 20 minutes. My Poxie girl will play with anything and will play as long as you let her.<br /><br />Boo likes watching and chaseing the catnip bubbles but dislike it when they pop (because then he gets squirted with wet/cold liquid .. even if it's tiny droplets). Poxie walks into the shower and isn't as picky about getting her paws wet so she goes crazy for them. So, Poxie will play forever if you let her and Boo gives up after a while, which is normal habit with most toys anyway :)<br /><br />I adopted both of them from the pound (a year and half apart) and both were noted as being more skittish than "normal". Both of them don't like a whole flurry of bubbles drifting down on TOP of them and will startle or run away every once in a while. So, when we play and it's been a while since I brought out the bottle, I start as low or eye level to them as possible (but don't blow directly in their faces) until they get used to the bubbles.<br /><br />I'm giving this four stars simply because the liquid "may cause stains" on carpet. So you might want to do a test swatch if you have really delicate fabrics. If your 'nip loving cat startles easily and doesn't like water (not that bubbles popping really is that bad?) then it's probably not the toy for them. If they like floating feathers or things that kinda "drift" slowly down, then they might like this :D

My cat goes absolutely nuts over cat nip sprays but after she smelled these bubbles she just walked away and could care less. The bottle just smells like chemicals if you ask me. If your cat likes bubbles to begin with, they will probably like any bubbles whether there is supposed to be catnip extract in it or not- you should save yourself a few bucks and just get regular bubbles in that case. Definitely not worth the money.

review/summary: Fresh and Tasty.
review/text: I was recently looking for lunch items at my local warehouse store and found this four-pound bag of Kirkland Signature Trail Mix. That would do fine. I put a handfull in a sandwich bag and pack it with my noon work time lunch. Stuff like this, together with a sandwich and piece of fruit is much preferable to dining in our food court, plus eating in my office saves a lot of time. The mix consist of peanuts. Raisins, almonds, cashews and a few M&M candies thrown it. There's no cholesterol or trans fat, but the calorie content is fairly high. It's nice and fresh and tasty and will stay that way in a bag that can be resealed. Also, when space is available, we store it in the fridge. It's a lot of trail mix, but I use it every other day and it's used around the house as a snack and we also take it camping.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: I enjoy these quite a bit... good for dieters
review/text: These oat cakes are really more like super-crumbly crackers... and they are quite good, even if they are heinously overpriced.  I enjoy eating them by themselves, they have a variety of textures and layers of flavor; a great substitute for other mindless eating, and one small packet can be stretched out for a while.  Interestingly enough, the organic version tastes saltier (pleasant surprise) but both their plain oat varieties are quite good.<br /><br />I also like that each box contains more than one sealed packet, so you can eat a few at one sitting and save the others without worrying about them going stale.  A nice touch; very considerate of the consumer.

review/summary: great price for very good product
review/text: If the price is too good to believe, well it's not.............  these Shitake are superior to supermarket brands at about half the price (which includes shipping).  Cap sizes are in the 1.25 to 1.75" range and are very uniform in shape.  Trust me, a pound of dried mushrooms is a LOT and at this price you can use them in just about anything; hint, save the soaking water, filter thru a paper towel or coffee filter in a strainer and use like wine, stock or water in soups, braises or reduction sautes.  Great flavor and can be substituted for porcini or cepes when you don't want to break the bank, though they're really best suited to asian dishes.  The reason they're so much cheaper is that they're cultivated where porcini/ceps are gathered in the wild; kind of like the difference between wild salmon and farm raised.<br /><br />10/28/11<br /><br />Please be advised that this product may or may not be the same as I purchased at the time of my review.  The vendor is entirely different and I have no confidence the product is from the same source or is in any way similar other than  by weight. I also question amazon's policy of using my review to promote a different vendor and likely different sourced product from that which I shared my experience with.<br /><br />*************<br /><br />After I posted the above revision amazon added back in the original vendor which I had experience with.  I don't know if this was coincidental or a result of my additional comment, but to ensure this doesn't become a continual issue, let me state that my purchase was made from JR Mushrooms & Specialties and that I stand by the review of the product they provided.  Any other vendor is likely to source this product differently and therefore my review should only be considered when purchasing from JR.

review/summary: Great Value for Shiitake and Great Quality
review/text: Since these Shiitake mushrooms seemed a great value, I thought I would stock up and ordered two pounds.  Well,that turns out to be a lot of mushrooms,  One pound equals about 5+ quarts of dried mushrooms, packed tight but not broken.<br /><br />The shiitake's range from medium to large size, with some larger than I expected.  All in all it was a good selection of various size and they all look quite nice.<br /><br />They come packed in a sealed plastic bag that shipped well, so I'm not quite sure what the concern related to pachaging by a previous reviewer was based upon.  You could not re seal the original bag, and I would not expect to do so, but transfering to zip lock bags or quart jars as I did works well.  I store other mushrooms in  glass quart jars as well and this method keeps them dry on your pantry shelf.  I would suggest you order these if you enjoy Shiitake Mushrooms in your stir fry and soups.<br />Great Value

review/summary: Poor Delivery Method~
review/text: Based on the many bags of dried Shiitake Mushrooms that I've enjoyed in the past, I made the obvious assumption that the 'shrooms bought from the Amazon website would also be of superior quality, much like the ones I've always purchased from the local Asian markets in my own neighborhood.  I just received my 1st order of dried Shiitake Mushrooms this afternoon, and was very disappointed to find that the contents were very dusty, with many broken mushroom caps and pieces, instead of whole caps.  The box that they were packaged in had been damaged, as well. While I'm not completely ready to place blame entirely on the purveyors of said 'shrooms, I do expect them to make it right or refund my money.  The mushrooms themselves, however, do taste fine and that is the most important aspect of this review.  'Nuff said....

Works with everything from eggs to chicken to salad dressing - a truly versatile hot sauce that the hot sauce lover will love. It's on the thin side, so don't expect something sticky like barbecue sauce or chunky like salsa - it's more in the family of a McIlhenny's tabasco, but with a more robust flavor.

review/summary: Goodbye Siracha, I'm Leaving You
review/text: As a fan of hot sauce on everything, EVERYTHING, I have to say I think I've found my equivalent of crack.  Sprinkle a little (crack/NW Elixirs Hott Sauce #1) on breakfast, lunch, and dinner, or you'll start craving it.  It adds great depth and kick to stews and hashes, I've added it in to a peach BBQ sauce I used to glaze baby back ribs and add a little kick, with eggs or eggs benedict it gives just the right amount of burn.  The mass market hot sauces lack the depth and rounded flavor found in this hot sauce.  Tabasco just seems too thin in both texture and flavor and while siracha is great, it still doesn't have what this sauce has.  I'm having a hard time describing exactly what, specifically, is in this that no other hot sauce has because it's difficult to articulate, but once you try it, you'll figure it out and never look back!

And Thirdly, these aren't even close to Red Bird Soft Peppermints, which are made in the US and have no sour aftertaste. They also sell Red Bird at Walgreens or CVS in a tub for $3.99 so Amazon isn't even close to those prices.

review/text: My cats love this spray but they don't roll on their toys that I spray with it they lick the heck out of them. My cats have all kinds of catnip scented toys that have lost their umph and so I spray them with this Kookamunga Spray and the cats really appreciate it. Me too since I don't have to keep replacing toys with new.

review/summary: Doesn't smell like Catnip
review/text: Prior to trying this product I had been using From the Field catnip spray for my three cats. They all love that product and go bonkers when I spray their toys. I tried this spray instead last time because it was less expensive. They don't react to this spray at all. When I opened the bottle and smelled it I noticed that it smells sort of minty, like it's been scented. In my experience catnip should smell sort of like overbrewed tea - not mint. I don't think this product is 'pure' catnip, or maybe I got an 'off' bottle. I wish I had spent the extra money on a higher quality product which works.

review/summary: A complete waste of money
review/text: My cat, who absolutely adores dried catnip, has not been attracted to anthing I've sprayed with this spray. I might as well just have sprayed air or water on things.<br /><br />I am sorry I purchased this spray, wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and definitely won't buy it again.
