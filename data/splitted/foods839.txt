review/summary: Awsome Snack for Kids..and Adults
review/text: I first discovered this product in our local Food Lion grocery store, but they stopped carrying them.  I searched everywhere, because my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter loved them.  I am trying to offer her snacks that are healthful and she is exposed to so much junk.  I looked online and found them.  I bought 2 packs of 2 different flavors and she was so excited that her "Gran" bought them just for her!  I highly recommend them.  You can always keep the excess quantity in the freezer until you need them.<br /><br />Very happy grandmother.

review/text: I love the idea of these and I was so sure my toddler would love them (he loves all bars). He tried them a few times but after a bite he would toss it. They are bite size- think fig newton size.

review/summary: Kids love'em, All be it a little messy.
review/text: Jammy Sammys are like minature ceral bars for small hands.  They can crumble and fall apart, so not a good car travel snack.  Kids love these things though.  So if you are looking for an organic option, that is small hand friendly, portable and fun - these fit the bill.

review/summary: Jammy Sammy - Blueberry & Oatmeal - great on-the-go snack
review/text: Both my 1.5 and 3.5 year olds love these snacks.  They are a bit on the sweet side but no more so than most packaged kid snacks, and the ingredients in this item are pretty straightforward (i.e. not a lot of weird chemicals or fillers), so that makes me feel a bit better.  I also don't give them out all the time.  I tend to use them when I need a snack when we're going out and about.  This also makes sense because they aren't cheap, so to use them all the time at home would be a waste of packaging plastic and money.  I actually discovered these when one child was having a meltdown at Target and I needed something FAST to quell the outbreak and this is what was handy.  After that discovery, I found Amazon to have the best deal in bulk.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/6/2012 - Kids still love these snacks.  I alternate them with other stuff, but especially good size for younger kido.  Not too big.

review/summary: Daughter Loves these, but they seem pricey
review/text: My daughter loves her Jammy Sammy Snacks, and they arent too bad for her which makes me feel better about giving them to her; however they are a little procey for what you get. My daughter is 2.5 and always asks for these as a snack, the only con I see is that they contain nuts so she cant take them to a lot of the places that now ban peanuts (havent seen a soy not alternative). But, it is definitley a favorite at home.

I feel good about giving these to my 1.5 year old because they are organic and healthy. I couldn't find them in my grocery store next time I went to buy, so I checked here and I'm glad that they are sold here! A little more pricey at amazon than my local grocery.

review/text: My 20 month old LOVES these, they are a little crumbly in her little hands, but luckily she insists on eating it out of the package, so that helps contain some of the crumbs. I definitly would not recommend using this food if your child is going to be walking around while snacking. As long as she's contained the mess doesn't matter. I have tried these as well, and think they're tastey as well. Blueberry is her favorite, the Chocolate Grammy Sammy is also a family favorite.

review/summary: Deceptive! Be warned!
review/text: *** Buyer Beware: Note that all negative reviews are from Amazon verified purchases. The positive reviews may be shills! ***<br /><br />The "tower" is less than 1 foot and most of the stuff inside is paper straw filling. Imagine going out to the grocery store and getting a few random bags of low-quality chocolate and stuffing them inside a box along with straw. Hardly an item worth giving as a gift. Unfortunately, what you see in the picture is not what you get. I am not sure how other reviewers can give this 5 stars. I can only assume this is an item that's fulfilled locally and therefore quality varies.<br /><br />The items inside are worth less than 1/4 the price of the box. The only decent chocolate inside are the Ghiradelli squares. The peanuts inside the peanut covered chocolates had gone bad.<br /><br />Get something else. It's almost embarrassing to give this as a gift.

review/text: This was supposed to be a present for our neighbors but unfortunately we decided not to give it to them because a very disappointing item. The pictures on Amazon are quite deceptive giving the impression that it's a large box or tower. But the actual tower is barely taller than a bottle of wine and contains chocolate for no more than a couple of people.<br /><br />For $40, it's extremely overpriced. I'd look for something bigger if you want to give this as a family present.

review/summary: Not so bad
review/text: After reading the reviews, and noticing that most if not all of the positive reviews were from the chocolate company, I was really doubting whether I'd made a good choice - I got this as a Christmas gift for my mom - and it just got here. There really isn't any filler except in the smallest two boxes, and that's minimal - the rest is chocolate. The tower isn't as big as it looks - the pictures are a bit decieving, but I wanted a treat, not enough chocolate to make someone turn inside out from the sugar high. Overall, I'm pleased with it, though I probably wouldn't get it again.

They said they would send a replacement and it still hasn't arrived.  The plants are nothing like what is pictured in the advertisement.  The second plant is so small, it didn't even have one bloom on it.  I ordered it for my son thinking he could feed it right away and was VERY disappointed in the product.

I discovered these bars about a month ago and they are just the right size (about 1.4 ounces each). The bars are large enough to satisfy a chocolate craving without being too much. If you only want a "taste" of chocolate, I recommend Dove Promises, but I love these. They truly do melt in your mouth and remember, chocolate is good for you! :)

review/summary: Great product, great results
review/text: I recently ran a marathon in November and trained all summer using Clif Shot Energy Gels during my LR's.  However, during one of the races I ran this summer they gave out PowerBar Gels and I loved them.  I recently bought an entire box of PowerBar Gels to train for a marathon in January and I can't see myself ever switching.  Here are the pros/cons:<br /><br />PowerBar PROS<br /> * thinner consistency which makes it easier to swallow<br /> * great taste - I have the Strawberry/Banana and found them to be the best tasting gel I ever had yet. 9.5 out of 10<br /> * easy to open - the packaging is very easy to open, even with sweaty hands during a run<br /><br />PowerBar CONS<br /> * haven't been able to come up with one yet<br /><br />Clif Bar PROS<br /> * Litter Leash on side of package to keep from ripping the top off.  Keeps the entire package in one piece to prevent littering.<br /> * Overall I can't complaining about the taste.  8 out of 10<br /><br />Clif Bar CONS<br /> * Hard to open - these Gels are almost impossible to open once your hands get wet.<br /> * Thick consistency - these Gels get thicker in cold weather and become very hard to swallow.  Plus the gel itself is a bit more powdery (Chocolate) then PowerBar.

review/summary: First marathon, they worked great.
review/text: I used these gels while training for my first marathon and finally during the marathon 4 days ago.  They were an invaluable tool in helping me finish.  If you take one every 45 minutes, your energy level stays constant throughout the run.  The Strawberry Banana flavor is also very tasty.

review/summary: Buy Gu.
review/text: I must preface this review with: I am a Gu fan. I've tried so many different brands, flavors, and types of gels/blocks/cubes, whatever, and I love Gu to get the job done. For PowerBar, I've tried the Vanilla, which is really delicious. It tastes like cake frosting! However, the vanilla does not have caffeine, so this does not fill my needs. I have tried the Double Latte, which I abhor--I thought it was AWFUL. It just stuck to my teeth and wouldn't go down, and yuck yuck yuck. I love coffee, too. But as a liquid, in a mug! :) I have heard from many runners that they enjoy the Green Apple, so I might try these in the future. The PowerBar brand is a thinner consistency than Gu or Clif, so sometimes I think it goes down a lot easier, especially if you're not near a water fountain or aid station. If the vanilla had caffeine, I would probably stick with that one. I couldn't run the distances I do without gels. I take one on a daily run of 7-8 miles, I'll take 2 gels on a weekend run of 14-16 miles, and I'll take 3 on a run longer than 20 miles (in addition to Clif Bars). I hope this helps someone make a gel decision!<br /><br />Oh, in addition, I want to point out that PowerBar gels are made in a facility that manufactures dairy products, whereas Gu does not. I hope this helps the allergy sufferers out there!

review/summary: Best tasting caffeinated gel. Flimsy on a bike.
review/text: If form factor was not a concern, the tangerine PowerBar Gel would be hands down my favorite all around gel. The taste is great, it packs enough caffeine to pick you up if you're about to bonk, and the wrapper is thin enough so that it is easy to squeeze out every last drop of gel from the wrapper. The thin, low profile wrapper is great if you put gels in your pocket, as most exercise clothing is thin and low on space. It's also less likely to poke you than other rigid gel packages.<br /><br />That said, if you tape gels to your bike frame like I do, the thin wrapper that works so well for squeezing works against you if you want them to stay flush on the bike frame. They end up sagging over the side of the bike which not only can be an aerodynamic issue (okay, maybe not a major concern for everyone), but the added stress on the side of the package ends up prematurely tearing the gel open. I haven't actually experienced the wrapper leaking on my bike yet, but I have noticed the beginnings of a tear on the wrapper.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you don't tape gels to you bike post, the tangerine PowerBar gels rock. If you do, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFW9RM">Hammer Energy Gel (12 pack)</a> instead (but Hammer Gels are a little more difficult to squeeze and get the gel out, and have a thicker texture).

They are easy to carry, store well in pockets or under gloves, and digest well with some water or light sports drink.<br /><br />Hint - I enjoy keeping the gels in the fridge or freezer before taking out on warm days. I like to keep them on the "solid" side if possible.

review/summary: Great for a long run or bike ride
review/text: I started running a couple years ago, and I ran my first marathon last year.  I always carry PowerGel with me on my long runs.  Yes PowerGel is just sugar and caffine, but when I'm bonking 15 miles into a 20 mile run, I am super glad I have one in my pocket.  I think the benefit comes mainly from the sugar, but I do tend to buy the flavors with 25mg of caffine.  In general I give PowerGel 4 to 5 stars, but I'm giving the Tangerine flavor two stars because I didn't like the taste.  All the other flavors are much better.

review/summary: this gel is the best
review/text: I'm an avid cyclist and XC mountain bike racer.  Like most gels this has all the clean burning fuel one needs for a quick boost pre-ride or, most importantly, during an endurance experience.  The taste is great, but what I like most of all is the texture...not at solid as the others so it goes down much easier, especially when one is gasping and grasping for breath and water bottle to wash it down.  It feels more organic and easier on the gut also.  It's the best I've found.

review/summary: The Anti-Fatigue
review/text: This is a fantastic product.  I'm relatively new to long distance running (my long runs are only 10k) and this is the first gel product I've used, but it did not disappoint.<br /><br />It's hard to credit my gains solely to this, so I will give a wrap-up of my experience and let you decide.  The first time I ran 10k, I had a time of 55:25 (I know that's slow, but I'm a bigger guy).  The second time I tried it, there were a few differences: I wore running shorts (the first time I wore basketball shorts) and I had a fuel belt equipped with a 20oz water bottle and two Strawberry Banana PowerBar Power Gel Packets; temperature and environment were similar during both runs.  Anyway, I popped these gel packs at around the 20 minute and 40 minute mark and my time dropped to 52:21!  I don't know about you, but I think an improvement of over 3 minutes is fantastic...  Especially if you consider that is nearly 30 seconds per mile.<br /><br />Okay, so I know the shorts (they were quite a bit lighter and didn't get soaked with sweat) and liquid helped quite a bit, as well as my muscles being a little more broken in from the first time I tried 10k, but the biggest thing I noticed was my consistency.  My third mile on my first run was a horrific 9:37 and way off the rest of my mile times.  During my second run, each mile ranged from around 8:17 (my 5th mile) to 8:37 (my first mile); I think the fact that my mile times improved as my run went on also illustrates the effectiveness of this product.  I track my time and distance with a Garmin Forerunner 205 (another fantastic product).<br /><br />Anyway, I highly suggest this product if you are new to long distance running or a veteran that competes.  If you dont' want to commit to an entire box, I bought a couple of individual packets at REI for $1.25 a piece just to see if I noticed an improvement.  Compared to the other reviews, I don't think this is hard to swallow at all.  If you spray a little water in your mouth before consuming the packet, it goes down even easier.  My one and only con would be that it is kind of sticky, so if you get any on your hands it's quite annoying; small price to pay in my eyes.

review/summary: Nice flavor and viscosity
review/text: I like PowerBar gel more than most other brands, mainly because of the viscosity/consistency. Competing brands like Gu are way too thick for eating on a run I think - especially in cold weather. The formulation I think could use improvement - it's a little sugary for me, and my stomach feels a little upset after consuming 3 or more on a long run, but it's not too bad (I don't know of anything better at the moment).<br /><br />The Banana strawberry flavor is one of the best, and has just the right of caffeine (1 shot), if you're looking to consume many during a long run.  Vanilla (no caffeine) and Tangerine (2 shots caffeine) are also among my favorites as well.<br /><br />Product came very quickly; I'm happy with the purchase.

review/text: I've tried a number of different gel brands and flavors as well as other energy products and found the Powerbar Tangerines to be my favorite.  Here's why I like them:<br /><br />- Flavor - The tangerine isn't too sweet and doesn't leave a bad aftertaste.<br />- Consistency - The gel isn't too thick so it's easy to get down even with a dry mouth.  I still suggest chasing with fluids.<br />- Caffeine - There's just enough to help get me over the hump on those tough days.<br /><br />This 24 pack is a great deal if you are training for marathons or other endurance races and plan on multi hour training sessions.<br /><br />See you on the trails!

review/summary: Not Yummy, Package Reacts in Mouth
review/text: I have been cycling a few hours in the heat on weekends, and using this type supplement to get what I need while riding, so I bought a case of the Tangerine with Caffeine. I have to say they seem to do the job and give me what I need, and the boost from the caffeine works as desired. The problem I have with the product is the taste is pretty bad, like concentrated children's aspirin. Also, the container/package seems to react with the my teeth or fillings, like having a battery on your tongue. So, basically consuming these is not pleasant, and I dread having to do it (like taking medicine). So, I will stick with the main competitor in this marketplace "Gu", which taste great.

review/text: I use before and during long rides. I prefer the PowerBar in part because it has 110 calories, not just 100 or 90 like some of the other brands, and at 20 mphs I want to get as much as I can when going thru the hassle of opening and consuming a gel. As to the effect: It seems to work as intended. Certainly gives me a bit of energy when I start to sag.  I've also used Gu and Hammer, and don't have any complaints about them other than much fewer calories per package. Suggest you try a few of each to come to your own conclusions.

review/text: I received the above product with 3 of the 24  units already leaking heavily. I figured that they burst in transit. No big deal, right? However, while cleaning the rest of the units I noticed, that with gentle pressure the seams were leaking very easily. One that didn't leak I took for a run......that burst in my pocket...no pressure applied as far as I could tell. Contacted the seller, they told me that "this happens". Wrote PowerBar more than a week ago, no response.  I will not be buying them again.<br />That being said, I was able to try 2 units. I love the stuff. The gel is thin enough to slide down a dry throat on a hot day. The taste isn't that bad, the citrus helps you salivate a bit to help it down. If it weren't for the poor packaging and horrible customer service, these would be my go to gels.

The other product works a bit better for me at keeping my energy level where it needs to be...that is not to even remotely say that this is bad because it's not. Also it tastes better than most(if you've ever used any of these energy gels during an intense workout you know they are all 1 step away from unpalatable). One of the packets had broken open in the box (it wasn't the shippers fault...the outer and inner boxes were in pristine condition) and dried causing all of the other packets to stick to the inside of the box. What a mess! I had to soak the box in water to get the packets loose, which also makes them more difficult to store. I'll go through them fairly rapidly, and the other box I received was in perfect condition.

review/text: The directions state that water should be consumed with this gel, so I consumed 4-6 oz of water with each gel. On some 10 to 24 mile marathon training runs I noticed only slight gastrointestinal problems, but on others real cramps and diaria were a severe problem. The common variable during the bad runs(no pun intended)was cold, rainy weather which drasticly reduced my sweat rate. Normal gel ingestion rate is one every half hour. At 75 years old my 24 mile run lasts around 4 hours or 7 gels. That is a lot of sodium even on a hot day. Next run is 16 miles and will also be cold and probably wet. I will try one gel every 45 to 60 minutes. THe next marathon is in 2 weeks so no chance to experiment with another gel. During 7 other marathons I used another gel with no upset and may go back to that gel if problems persist. This powerbar gel is easier to swallow(not as thick and gooey)and very close to the same ingrediants as the other gel, so<br />gave it a try.

review/text: Training for the Honolulu Marathon 12/09/11.  I go through a case(24)of gel in a month.  I have been buying gels on sale for $.99 each.  Found this terrific deal on Amazon for $.74 each and free shipping.  The case is mailed to me automatically each month and my credit card is billed when the item is shipped.  Can't get any easier than that!!!

review/summary: Probably works well. Taste... well not so good.
review/text: I like trying various kinds of energy drinks, foods and such, so I purchased a box of these based on the reviews.<br /><br />If you are running a race and need a boost, it would probably do the trick.<br /><br />As for taste, it's not "bad" persay, but it's not good either. The taste is exactly as you would imagine if you mixed strawberry jelly with artificial banana flavor and added a bunch of salt.<br /><br />Which leads to often, a pack of warm sweet and salty goo.<br /><br />While appealing to some, it never ended up appealing to me, as such I still have most of the box in the drawer which it will probably stay.

review/text: I have really like this product.  The strawberry taste really good and is by far my favorite flavor. It is not as thick as cliff gel which to to me is a good thing.  The biggest thing I wish it had was some type of litter hanger for the top.  Other than that I have no issue opening and eating while mountain biking.  It helps keep my hypoglycemia under control.  I keep a pack or 2 in my backpack at school for the same reason to keep me from getting hit with a low blood sugar moment.

These have helped me run 2+ hrs and the longest I've ran is 7hrs. I take them about every 45 min. I've tried other brands, but this is one where I can feel the burst of energy within a few minutes.

review/text: I was very hesitant to try energy gels.  Many energy bars and gels have a bad taste.  I am training for my first half marathon, however, and often suffer from "brain fog" during the long runs.  I took my first gel before a shorter run and found it to be very tasty.  I thought that the gel was sweet and not salty tasting (which was perfect to me!).  I also felt a real increase in my energy and noticed I was running easier and faster.  I plan to use these during my training and then on race day.  I would recommend this energy gel!

review/summary: Easier to carry than to open, tangy flavor, strong caffeine
review/text: So far I have only tried this gel on bike rides. Convenient if you run out of sports drink before you run out of water. The tangy flavor made the gel easier to swallow.<br /><br />The packaging on this gel seems to be either thinner or more flexible than some others I have tried. Good because it is not scratchy in the back pocket of a jersey. Hard to tear the top off without losing it while riding, however. I had to stop to avoid littering.<br /><br />Double caffeine is perhaps too much if you take more than one gel. Again, depends on your reaction, though. (I get above average stimulation from caffeine.)

review/text: This product arrived 24 packs in a box. Two packs had leaks which caused a big mess upon opening. The damaged packs were identified and discarded. The clean up required gallons of water as the sticky gel surrounding most of the packs had to be washed thoroughly. I cannot imagine how the damaged packs could have been opened enroute, so the shipment must have left the dealer broken. Lesson learned, never buy bulk through the mail. It is too tempting for a unscrupulous dealer to unload damaged goods. So I saved nothing over retail cost by buying from this source. BTW: The gel taste great, that's why I gave it 3 stars.

review/summary: Not sure I'm using this gel to its full potential; easy to use and carry
review/text: I'm still learning how (or whether) to use these gels in training or racing.  I just downed a PowerBar Gel (strawberry-banana, 1X caffeine) following a 10K race plus an extra 4 mile training run.  I do forget the exercise physiology here... am I supposed to use DURING the run, before, or after?  I've got a half marathon coming up next week, so I'm most concerned about injury and cramp prevention at this stage.  But I've also got a 188 mile team race coming up, where I have to run 3 stages.  Last year, I used this gel between my segments (plus peanut butter sandwiches and gobs of fluids).<br /><br />Here's what I know.  This PowerBar Gel is easy to consume (even the green apple flavor... you won't treat it as a candy).  I haven't had any leakage problems yet, and it is easy to use: squeeze and swallow.  However, I really can't tease out any real benefits due to the product, or whether I'm experiencing a placebo effect.  In fact, I wonder whether you have to be a very fine athlete, pushing your body to the limits, for there even to be a measurable effect.<br /><br />In other words, are these gels just adult pacifiers?<br /><br />Well, I probably need all the help I can get.  I'm not sure about the 0, 1X, or 2X caffeine content.  The caffeine can't be for recovery, can it?  So it is a minor, legal stimulant?<br /><br />As long as I can get these for about a dollar per unit, the taste isn't bad, and they don't break and leak, I'll keep using them.  Helpful comments, observations, and use instructions welcomed!

review/text: The Tangerine doesn't taste good at all, haven't tried other flavors. I suspect they got the caffeine from coffee, not tea. Almost seemed like a black coffee taste. Some people who are sensitive to coffee might then get a stomach ache. I even tried adding sugar to it and it was still bad. Maybe the other flavors are okay since many don't have caffeine. FYI, it only has a little more caffeine then a 20 oz Coke does, try the shots if you want more.
