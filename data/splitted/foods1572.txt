review/summary: Finally chips that taste great and are healthy too!
review/text: Wow, I tried to stay away from the "pita chip craze" but once I had one of these at a friend's party I fell in love.  These are great by themselves, but I personally love them with some hummus...mmm.<br /><br />Finally a great tasting, healthy substition for the 50% daily fat value of the regular fried chips out there!  These are thick, crispy, and my whole family loves them.  I have yet to give them to someone that didnt like them.

review/summary: High Sodium, Rock Hard
review/text: I was looking for a chip that was low sodium and tasted decent. I thought these simply naked pita chips would be good, but they are not. I read the nutrition facts. 270mg for 1 oz./serving size! That's 1620mg for the bag!!!!! These 6oz. bags are not very big either! You can finish them pretty quick, like some people have said here.<br />I really wouldn't say these chips are healthy, there is fat and saturated fat.<br />However, these chips are healthier than cheetos, and doritos, but they don't taste as good. They are also rock hard.

review/text: I have loved Kraft Mac N Cheese since I was a child, and it has consistently stayed as delicious as always! I actually don't have children, and buy the character shapes for myself. I actually prefer the texture of the shapes to that of the traditional macaroni, so having the option with this brand is a plus. Also, Subscribe & Save is great! I work overnights, so I sleep during the day, and getting to the grocery store each week can be a pain. Getting things in bulk and delivered right to my door is perfect!

review/summary: Woah Oh Ohhh, It's Magic!
review/text: You've scooped your ice cream.  You've added the whipped cream. You've poured the rainbow sprinkles.  And yet your sundae is still missing the final touch.  If you think that your dessert would be fine with just the typical Hershey's Chocolate Sauce, and that there is no further way to increase its deliciousness, then you obviously have not tried Magic Shell.  You snap off the cap and begin to pour.  The sauce looks slightly lighter than usual.  You wait for about fifteen seconds.  The liquid sauce begins to solidify from the cool contact of the ice cream.  This may surprise you at first--but you're kind of curious, right?  Go on, take a bite!<br />The taste of ice cream and candy has found its perfect balance.  You don't have to deal with the harshness of frozen chocolate chips, because Magic Shell has a gentle crunch. The sauce is slightly salty, complementing the sweetness of the ice cream, like the way peanut butter complements the chocolate in a Reeses peanut butter cup.  The Magic Shell does not distract from the taste of any type of ice cream, but rather adds a twist to the texture that makes each flavor all the more distinct and delicious.  The froth of the whipped cream and the richness of the ice cream meet the delicious chunks of your new-found discovery.  You will never turn back.

By what black art did the makers conjure the ability for something to freeze in seconds at room temperature? Begs the questions, was it invented by accident, or by a sage?

review/text: My daughter is dairy allergic and used to drink another brand of hemp milk, but they changed their recipe and added carrageenan which has been upsetting her stomach.  I was so excited when I discovered Pacific Natural now offers hemp milk.  Not only is it free of carrageenan and sugar, but it tastes great!  It is also really high in calcium.  It is reassuring to know that she's getting such a great dose of nutrients and the essential omega fatty acids.

review/summary: Taste test
review/text: I did a comparison taste test on this Pacific Foods Hemp Milk Original and the Living Harvest Tempt Hemp Milk Original. This hemp milk has a thicker-than-dairy, smoother mouth feel due to the Xanthan gum...too thick IMHO. I can also taste the brown rice syrup sweetener which Pacific Foods puts in all their milks. In comparison, the Living Harvest milk does not have a faux creaminess agent added to it and tastes more straightly of mild, sweet hemp milk rather than brown rice syrup. For these reasons I prefer the LH Tempt milk. I like the thinner and better flavor.

review/summary: Makes me smile every morning
review/text: Pacific Natural hemp milk is my first "purchase" choice; it is my second favorite hemp milk, though.  Tempt has a silkier, earthier flavor that I prefer (as well as unsweetened offering), but it is too pricey for current $$ (don't want to cut other food choice options).  With that said, Pacific Natural's hemp milk is my go-to and everyday hemp milk.  The flavor still has enough of an earthy base and silkiness that makes me smile every morning (and I have it every day!).  In my opinion, Pacific Natural hemp milk is the closest in texture and mouth feel to whole cow's milk; luckily, I also believe it tastes much, much better, too.  It's also a perfect substitute for cooking/baking.  I've recently tried Trader Joe's hemp milk (recent addition to their line), and it is a watered down version of hemp milk; so Pacific Natural is still my first choice.  Do your taste buds, health, and earth a big favor and make the switch.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: Ive been drinking rice milk for a year, its really watery though for cooking. Then I stumbled upon Hemp milk. I tried the organic pacific from a store and thought I was buying the organic. This is just about as good. The organic has a slight less nutty flavor. It works excellent for cooking. Makes mashed potatoes very thick. Cant wait to make pumpkin pie with it. I highly recommend it. I eat every day with my cream of rice. I mix it with the rice milk 50/50.<br />Tried another brand "Tempt". It wasnt as thick as this one. I like the thickness when using it for cooking. Didnt like the flavor of Tempt as much as Pacific brand.

review/text: I agree with other reviewers that the change in formula for another leading brand greatly reduced its appeal,  however, Pacific's 140 calories and 130 mg of sodium versus the other leading brand's 60 calories and 25 mg of sodium per cup makes Pacific a much less appealing substitute for those with diet restrictions.  After my initial enthusiasm,  I will need to cancel my Amazon subscription for this item.

review/text: We were using another brand.<br />I was mixing it with soy milk because my 15 month old son did not like the taste of it.<br />The whole point to putting him on Hemp milk was to get him off of soy, not just reduce.<br /><br />After researching this company and this product, I felt that it would be a better quality taste than the other brand.  It came in today and I gave him a cup with this in it straight, not even cold.  He sucked it down with a smile.  I have tasted both and this one tastes way better by far.  The other had a very strong flavor that was much like rancid walnuts.  This tastes very good.<br /><br />I fell confidant giving this to my baby that he is getting great nutrition and a high quality product at the same time.

review/summary: If trying to decrease diary consumption
review/text: This is one way to make the change from diary use. I've tried soy milk, almond milk,rice milk and oat milk (I really like the oat milk for non coffee uses). Hemp milk won out for use in my coffee. I used to drink a gallon and a half of 1% organic milk per week. I now use 1/2 to 3/4's of a gallon per week, so quite an improvement. I've also used this to make hot chocolate. If you really want an enjoyable alternative for hot chocolate milk, try chocolate hazelnut milk-very satisfying, but high calorie. What I like most about the hemp milk is there is no noticeable difference to my palate or visually when used in coffee. The down side is the cost compared to organic milk, although I use the subscribe and save. I've also purchased the hemp seeds which taste close to a sunflower seed and the hemp oil which also has a nutty taste. I watched the Hemp Revolution documentary. I learned this is an incredible multiple use sustainable plant that basically has no waste and is healthy for the environment and financially rewarding for the farmer. As an aside here is a quote from Jefferson. "Hemp is of first necessity to the wealth & protection of the country." -Thomas Jefferson (due to use in making rope, paper and ship sails of canvas).

review/summary: I wanted to like this, but couldn't
review/text: I found this in the fridge one day as my wife had bought it. I was excited to try it right away. The texture was smooth and grainy and the flavor not at all what I had hoped for. It has an oily fatty taste to it and the after taste is akin to what you may expect from eating unprocessed flour.  In fact, if you imagine someone pouring a cup or two of flour into a glass of milk, and stirring it into a smooth disolved liquid, then that's pretty much what you've got. It's not hard to imagine the particles in the milk would settle if the milk is untouched hence I would expect shaking before drinking to be important.<br /><br />Pro<br /> - it's hemp which is an awesome plant. (1 acre of hemp produces as much paper as 4 acres of trees)<br /> - nice creamy texture<br /><br />Cons<br /> - taste  like dissolved flour in water<br /> - feels a bit too thick and oily

Trader Joes always had a great price and this is the healthiest type of "milk" out there (compared to soy milk, rice milk, whole grain drinks). I compared the prices that I used to pay to this of amazon and it wasn't too much of a difference. So I pay a couple of cents more-- but now I have it delivered to my house! No more lugging 12 boxes home with me (plus a diaper bag and a 26 lb little one!) It's totally worth the money and it's a really great product as an alternative to drinking dairy.

It also left an aftertaste that I couldn't get rid of even after brushing my teeth and using mouthwash. Last but not least, though its sugar-free it is not low calorie; each piece of gum is 20 calories. I have no idea what I'm going to do with this... most likely will toss the entire lot in the garbage. What a disappointment and waste of money.

There are 3 grams of sugar alcohols in one piece, which seems like a lot.<br /><br />The taste seems very much like the original, sugar-sweetened product.  The pieces strike me as being a little smaller than the original.  I have not tried blowing any bubbles, but I suspect one would need more than one piece for that.  Like the sugar-sweetened version, the flavor does not last very long but, unlike the original, once the flavor has worn out, there seems to be a vague, off-putting, somewhat-sour flavor left behind -- the only reason I dropped a star on the rating.<br /><br />Being that it is sold here in packs of 12-boxes, I will be chewing for awhile.  It doesn't quite make me feel like a kid again, but I am enjoying it like I did as a kid.

review/summary: Tastes great!
review/text: As there were no reviews when I was thinking of purchasing this, I decided to write one so others could know what they're getting. It is fairly pricey and I had to buy it to find out about it. The popcorn you pop in the microwave is just plain popcorn. Each bag comes with a packet of caramel--actually it's a flat, soft piece of caramel in a foil packet. You have to put the popped corn into a microwave safe container, cut the caramel piece into four pieces, lay them over the popped corn, and put it back into the microwave until the caramel is melted. Then you take two spoons and mix it up until the caramel is evenly distributed. It's a bit more messing around than I usually like to do, but the result is delicious.

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

review/summary: Great for Hairball Control
review/text: I have a 15 year old gray short hair kitty who is prone vomiting hairballs. Anyone who has been awakened at night with the sound of a cat throwing up a hairball or has found one staining their nice wood floor in the morning knows how annoying this can be. Not to mention how stressful for the poor cat. The Meow Mix hairball formula seems to help a whole lot with her problem. I've tried giving her a wide variety of other dry food, some supposedly very healthy and expensive, but I always go back to this product because it works. I vary her diet with wet food twice a day and let her nibble on the dry food when she wants. She looks terrific. My other cat is 13 and eats the same diet, she is also very healthy.

review/summary: The best sauce imaginable
review/text: I found this product at an Earth Fare store which is an hour from where I live.  It retails for about $10 per jar.  At first, I thought this was a lot to spend on spaghetti sauce, but after trying it one time, it was worth every penney and more!  This is absolutely the most wonderful marinara I have EVER tasted.  It is like you just made it yourself from fresh ingredients.  The flavor is awesome.  It does not taste like pre-made spaghetti sauce at all.  I couldn't get back to the health food store recently, so I bought something I thought would be similar.  No comparison.  I can get more of this heavenly sauce at Amazon and glad I won't have to drive two hours round trip.  If you love a tomatoey, fresh, natural marinara sauce, give this a try.  The tomatoes are imported from Italy and grown in the foothills of Mt. Vesuvius.  I gave jars of sauce for Christmas presents this year.  I can't wait to try all the flavors, but right now, the garlic marinara is my favorite.  You won't go back to those other sauces again!  Absolutely the best available.  :)

review/summary: Good flavor, big solid leaves
review/text: Have purchased Two Leaves and a Bud tea many times over the years and have to say that the peppermint is, by far, my favorite. The mint is clean and refreshing and the tea is high quality. The tea bags are made of a fine mesh and the leaves are large cut and release very little dust that can ruin the end of a cup. I prefer to drink my tea after steeping for 2-3 minutes (don't like it overly strong myself) and find I can usually get a decent second cup from 1 tea bag. It is one of my favorite peppermint teas though I have knocked off one star for the high price and the fact that the mesh tea bags occasionally rip if you're not careful when pulling the tag off.

review/summary: Organic Brown Rice is MAJOR healthy
review/text: For years I've either gone to a health food store for my LUNDBERG ORGANIC brown rice, or hired someone to go for me. Recently I've switched to ordering on line, and in a few weeks, this will be on my shopping list.<br /><br />I began buying brown rice when someone who'd visited my website said it was "beneficial" no matter what blood type you have. I researched the Blood Type Diet and decided to try it. To my amazement the long time gastrointestinal problems I had from low vitamin B12 went away, despite the fact doctors had said they were "permanent".<br /><br />Amazon makes it possible for me to order what I need, when I need it, rather than trying to write one perfect shopping list so that my cost of hiring a shopper isn't exorbitant.<br /><br />I highly recommend this rice. Yes, shop at a health food store or Costco for Lundberg Organic Brown Rice, but if you are housebound like me, order it through Amazon. You'll love what the rice does for your health. (Especially now that we know GMOs are so dangerous to health, and GMOs are in almost all packaged grocery food.)

review/text: I use the Crystal Light Energy instead of the  usual 2 cups of coffee. It is sugar free no carbs no fat, and you do not have to worry about spilling hot coffee on you. Also it mixes well in ta regular 16 oz. water bottle for taking to work and fitting in the cup holder.  The taste is good instead of the acid and pure caffeine of coffee you need not to add  artificial creamer or  fattening cream  or sugar. So to sum up anyone looking to get away from coffee and get a bit healthier this is a way to go, is great tasting (and I normally hate artificial sweeteners) and gets you started on the 1-2 liters of water you should be be drinking every day.. This is a diet supplement as well so it curbs appetite. I would say this is a great product for those dieting or looking for an alternative to Soda or teeth staining coffee.<br /><br />El Che

review/text: This is the best flavor of beverage (powdered, carbonated, or not) that I have had.  I don't even care that it has caffeine in it.  That just means that I need to be more conservative and not drink 6 packets a day.  I find it better watered down.  I have a 24 ounce bottle that one packet is perfect for.  It tastes the best between 24 ounces and 1 liter (33.8 ounces).  I have a 40 ounce bottle, and it is still good with just one packet, but it is a little bit too watered down.  I never drink anything that comes in a 16.9 ounce bottle, but I think it is still a bit too strong (but still tasty) in a 20 ounce bottle.

review/summary: Alertness without the drawbacks of soda
review/text: I've never been a coffee drinker, so I relied on diet soft drinks at those times when I need a caffeine boost.  Unfortunately, the types I like tend to stain my teeth, and the acid from them sometimes upsets my tummy.<br /><br />The "Energy" in this version of CL is equal to about 2 shots of espresso, so it definitely gives you a kick start in the morning.  The flavor is yummy - I mix it in my 22 oz water bottle, so it's a bit weaker than the recommended mix.  I do wish they made the "Energy" type in other flavors, just for variety sake.

review/summary: Where Is the Strawberry Energy???
review/text: I seriously love the Strawberry Energy drink, but it seems you have either quit making it or quit sending it to my 2 stores that I go to.  I live in Stuart, Florida and I primarily shop at Walmart and Publix.  They both say the same thing, You are "Discontinuing" this flavor.  It is the only energy drink that I will drink.  I bought the Grape but I didn't care for it at all.  Please do not discontinue this drink.  I am a diabetic who hates water.  I drink one bottle of this is the morning to get me going and then your Raspberry Green Tea or your Natural Lemon Iced Tea.  My Dr. Recommends this Crystal Light for me.  Please Help.  I would appreciate anything you can do to make purchasing this easier.  Thank you in advance.

review/summary: LIFE CHANGER!!!!!
review/text: I can with all truth say these little packets changed my life. I have been on every vitamin known to man. I have had every test ran. Due to the fact I was suffering from extreme fatigue. I had all but given up hope that I would ever feel energized. I was on my way to a new job and stopped at a local convienent store to grab a bottled water. I saw that with the purchase of their water you got a free Crystal light packet. I got the strawberry and was blown away. First by taste it is soooo gooooood!!! Then I noticed I had a little pep in my step which I never had. I went back the next day did the same bought 2. Same results. I them went and got a case of water and a couple boxes of them from my local grocery store. Needless to say I am never without my bottle of water with my wild Strawberry energy crystal light!!

review/summary: Closest thing to drinking water... only SWEETER!!!
review/text: Since I started my weight loss journey, I knew that I needed to increase my water intake without the calories. Diet sodas were OK, but at the end of the day, I felt bloated as though I had the real thing... it was ridculous! To make it worse, I was trying to get the whole family off of sodas, juices, lemonade and unhealthy drinks. Then I bought the "Wild Strawberry and Pink Lemonade" flavors at the local Publix store and to my greatest surprise, they tasted great with only 5 calories per satchet/16oz bottle...WHAT?! I must say, my kids even loved it. I take 3-4 bottles a day, depending on how busy I am. I am also pleased that I can order a large quantity at Amazon that can last me a month. I have lost 13lbs in addition to changing my choice of foods and my kids love their new organic vege/fruit drinks. Life is just CLEAN and HEALTHY. My husband is still drinking his Minute Made Lemonade which is fine with me. My Crystal Lights are off limits!:) I strongly recommend that you purchase, try, and hopefully enjoy this product. There are other flavors too. Just make sure that they're the 5 cal kind if you're monitoring your caloric intake. Well done Crystal Light:)<br />... Love, A VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER.

review/summary: It really does provide energy.
review/text: This is hilarious.  I bought a variety pack of these in four different flavors (at my local Wholesale warehouse) and figured the labels, such as "Energy" were just a gimmick.  Just a little while after drinking one of these packets I couldn't figure out why I was jittery, then it clicked!  I really didn't expect it to do anything, I just wanted it because it's strawberry.  I definitely won't be needing a coffee today!  I'm very glad I didn't have both this morning or I would be wired.  I appreciate the energy, but would probably cut it to half a packet next time since it apparently does have an effect on me.<br /><br />Keep in mind, I am not a caffeine addict.  I don't drink soda and usually only have a cup of coffee in the afternoon as a pick-me-up/snack.  It probably wouldn't make a normal person jittery, but definitely provides a jolt considering it's just water.

review/summary: Best one I've tried so far
review/text: Over the last 2 or 3 months I've tried several different brands and flavors of these individual beverage mixes. Of all of them the Crystal Light brand is the best. It has a nice flavor that actually tastes like what its supposed to. But most of all it actually disolves easily without having to shake it for several minutes like the Lipton brand. The only other one I've tried that mixes as easy as this one is the Propel. But its way more expensive too. The four different Lipton flavors that I've tried were not very good and were hard to get to dissolve in the bottle.<br />  Some reviewers have said that they don't like that it has Aspartame in it, what ever that is. But, if your paranoid enough you can find something in just about everything that somebody will claim causes cancer, will make your hair fall out, turn your toe nails green, ruin your liver, and give you brain damage.<br />  As for me, I like this beverage more than any of the other mixes that I've tried. For a side note, since I started trying out these mixes over the last couple of months I've dropped over 25 pounds. This one is one of my favorites and I will be buying more of it in spite of the Aspartame, what ever that is, that's in it. Its also pretty good with a shot of spiced rum in it too. [;-�

review/summary: too much caffine / serving
review/text: if you consider that we're suppose to drink 8+ cups of water a day and each serving (if mixed w/ recommended proportions), you'd get 480 mg of caffine. that's way over recommended levels.<br />the flavor is fine, but also tangy. it mixes easily enough, seems to mix very well and doesn't seperate as far as i can tell, also, this drink contains b vitamins (which is what energy drinks use to make the caffine more efficient).<br /><br />The caffine content is on the label (60mg/serving), in the fine print under the nutritional facts. The label does mention caffine on the front, but it isn't clearly labeled, they put it in the fine print!<br /><br />I would have given this four stars if any of these were true: the caffine content was better displayed, if it had less caffine, if it wasn't so tangy, if they clearly labeled a warning / caution about the high levels of caffine / serving.<br /><br />If you decide you need flavor in your water and find yourself drinking huge gulps because you think: it's mostly water and you think it's healthy to drink huge ammounts of water, then don't use the recommended mix proportions. each cup of water  contains a lot of caffine, this drink isn't meant to be a "gulped" drink, it should be thought of as similar to coffee. limit your daily intake of this! and don't drink this in the evening hours! it's caffine + b vitamins. you'll probably ruin your sleep schedule if you drink this hours before you're supppose to sleep. it is more of an energy drink, not a refreshment.<br /><br />the first time i tried this, i mixed a full pitcher, 1/2 gallon or about 8 cups, without realizing how much caffine it had (i actually didn't know it had any, i thought the "energy" in the title was part of the name of the flavor) and it made me very jittery throughout the day. I feel this experience was partially my fault and partially the label's fault, it should have done a better job stating the important info, but i technically should have read the entire package (and the included manual, haha) before i decided to try it. But, this experience has little influence over my rating / review of this product.

review/text: I was looking for something to give me some extra energy for my workout and tried Crystal Light Energy - Wild Strawberry. What a mistake. While it tasted great and gave me the energy boost I wanted for my workout, after my workout I was still very jittery and felt out of it. It also started to make me feel sad and irritable! This feeling lasted for another 12+hours after my workout. I wasn't able to get to sleep until 4:00 in the morning and only slept for about 45 minutes. I drank this product with 17 oz of water and lots of ice so it's not like I didnt have enought water to help dilute it. I drank it at 1:30pm and it lasted until 4:00am when I was finally able to fall asleep for a little. I threw out the rest of the product and will never try it again. Very scary and uncomforable experience. I only gave it one star for the taste and because I had to - no option to give no stars!!!

review/summary: Best treats ever!
review/text: My dogs demand their Yip Yaps everyday when I get home from work. One of my dogs is so old, he only has five teeth left & won't eat hard food but he's the first one to be standing at the counter where the Yip Yaps are kept.

review/summary: Jack love Yip Yap
review/text: Ours is a rescue dog who is as finicky as we've ever seen... and his breath becomes a problem. Luckily he LOVES Yip Yaps! They are like candy to him and they do give temporary relief of his 'dog-breath'. And our order through Amazon was the least expensive (by far) way to get this product.<br /><br />This product has changed over the years... we don't feel for the better. They used to be denser, crunchier and more to the container. Our dog still enjoys them but does not 'freak out' for them like he used to.

review/summary: Most Important my dog LOVED it!
review/text: I was a bit skeptical when we first saw these in PetsMart. My dog is still young and has not yet experienced TRUE bad doggie breath, but I'm fighting a war before it begins. She absolutely loved it, and it made her breath smell just like fresh rosemary. Now anytime she is even in the deadest of sleep and she hears that tin jingle she comes running.<br /><br />Also, I've noticed that it doesnt only fight the breath on the spot, but usually we give her 2 at a time, as treats for a trick or two, and we've noticed her breath smells great for atleast 2-3 days

review/summary: High Hopes
review/text: I really had high hopes for this product, but I am sorry to say that I have no idea if this works or not. I have the pickiest dog ever, and she turned her nose up at them! I have to admit though that after I smelled them, they didn't smell too appetizing.
