review/summary: Alternative eats
review/text: The choco/almond Pure Natural Bar is a good energy alternative for times when one can't sit down for a real meal. I work from 8am-3pm at one job then ride my bike to my second job, 3:30-8pm. These bars are perfect to toss in my bag and eat at 5 or 6pm. The taste is perfectly ok, although I wouldn't be sorry if it had an even more chocolatey flavor. It's nice and moist, which my old standby, powerbars are not... Each bar is filling and satisfies hunger pangs. I wish a single bar wasn't so calorie dense, but that's probably due to all the nutty goodness, which is what provides the sustaining energy. So as long as one doesn't eat them by twos and threes, it's probably all good.

review/summary: A decent bar.
review/text: As I unwrapped the wrapper to this bar, I was a bit surprised. The description of these bars describe them as "rich, dark cocoa with heart-healthy, crunchy almonds," and the packaging has images of almonds and chocolate. A look at the bar also reveals fruit, specifically dates.<br /><br />Having said that, I found the bars to be quite good. The dates added a nice touch to the chocolate and almonds, and as the bar is less than 200 calories and gluten free, one can't complain too much.  While these probably aren't the best bars in the market, they are definitely worth trying, just don't let the marketing of the bar fool you into expecting a decadent alternative to a candy bar. These bars have a healthy feel to them, which I found to be tasty.

review/text: The ingredients are simple and 100% organic, not "all natural", which means nothing. Enough chocolate and almonds and sweetness (from the dates), but doesn't taste like I'm eating a candy bar. And my body feels good afterwards, not like after eating a candy bar. Healthy and delicious!

review/summary: A nice healthy snack that is lacking something
review/text: Pure Natural Bars Chocolate Almond is a nice snack tat's perfect for those who are into eating healthy.  Others need not apply.  I thought the bars tasted okay but they definitely are missing something.  I can't quite place it but it's pretty bland.  If you're a health food nut then you'll probably go gaga over them and find it utterly "divine".  I found them to be okay.

review/summary: Good, but need to change the package design
review/text: I have tried most of energy bars and natural bars available in the US. And, this "Pure Natural Bars - Chocolate Almond" has one of the better taste in this category.<br />It's not too sweet and has natural, yet complex taste.<br /><br />The biggest problem is the picture on the package. It gives you a wrong expectation of this bar. When I saw the photo, I expected Pure Natural Bars to be similar to my favorite Kind bars such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0DMME">KIND PLUS, Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>. While you can enjoy crunchiness of whole almonds and real chocolate to taste with Kind bars, you don't recognize individual taste of Almonds or chocolate with Pure Natural Bars. Pure Natural Bars are rather similar to Larabars such as [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JRALAS">Larabar Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Lemon Bar, 1.8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 16)</a>, which I also quite like (not as much as Kind bars, though).<br /><br />As long as you know what you are getting, you'd like this bar.

review/summary: Really yummy!
review/text: At first these taste like a meal replacement bar... sort of bland and chewy. Then after the second bite, you realize that they're more like a less-sweet brownie, and you look forward to the next bite. They're not too chocolatey, which I really appreciate because I don't have too much of a sweet tooth. Like the peanut-raisin variety, I would recommend these as an afternoon snack to tide you over until dinner. And like the peanut -raisin, I'll be buying these in future.

review/summary: Mealy But Good [Upgraded to Five Stars]
review/text: The taste leaves nothing to be desired although the chocolate could be richer so why am I not giving this a full five stars? I didn't expect the soft `mealiness' of that first bite, it's like eating a very dense oatmeal when I'd expected a crunchier texture.<br />Understand that this doesn't take away from the experience though and in the one place where it counts, cutting down on hunger and getting you to your next meal, it fits the bill.<br />Recommended.<br />[Update: I have to upgrade this to five stars. I've just finished the last bar in the box and I have to say it's delicious, filling, and even the mealiness I pointed out before simply becomes unnoticeable. One of the things that's changed my mind is how much my 20-month-old son loves eating this bar. It contains nothing that'll cause him grief and being as picky an eater as he is, the fact he munches down entire bars says something for the quality and taste of the Pure bars. Upgraded to Five Stars.]

review/summary: Okay, not great
review/text: The taste and texture of these bars vaguely remind me of brownies I've gotten out of vending machines in times past.<br /><br />Taste: Vaguely fruity, mainly sweetness with dates and hints of cherry (this comes from the almonds) and yes, chocolate.  The chocolate flavor is quite weak for a "chocolate" bar.<br /><br />Texture: About what you'd expect from a "health" bar; it's a solid mass with little identifiable texture.  It's about what I'd expect a baked good to be like if you left out the leavening.<br /><br />Appearance: Errr... it's a good thing this bar isn't in a clear package, as nobody would buy it.  The choice of dutched coccoa (which is quite dark when cooked) lends an appearance that suggests a huge amount of chocolate flavor that this bar simply does not provide.  It also makes the bar look... how do I put this... like it has already been eaten and "processed" by your digestive system.  To be sure, it tastes quite acceptable, but if I was formulating this bar, I'd add additional standard-process chocolate, which is lighter in color, and forgo the cost benefits of the flavor-enhanced dutched cocoa (which creates a rather dark-brown product.)<br /><br />I suppose if you are a Celiac kosher-keeping vegan boycotting HFCS and Sugar that is not having intense chocolate cravings this bar might be for you.  Otherwise, get your chocolate fix elsewhere.

review/text: I leave mine in the fridge. It's perfect for the summer.<br /><br />It is a bit soft and chewy on the inside without the stickiness to teeth. You could taste the almond flavor but not much. The picture doesn't really reflect the inside truthfully.

It has the right amount of sweetness and thick chocolate flavor with a hint of almond.<br /><br />I really like it!

review/text: I wanted to like these bars, I really did. It's nice that they're vegan, kosher and have lots of fiber, but the sad, sad thing is, I just don't like them and can't imagine myself eating them. If I had to eat them, I would. You know, if I was little and my mother made me, like parents used to make their kids swallow cod liver oil all those years ago. Well, these bars aren't that bad, but they don't taste very good, to me anyway. I see others have liked them and I suppose taste is subjective, so please take this review with a grain of salt.

review/summary: Chocolate Treat
review/text: If you're looking for a chocolate treat that's healthy, this bar is a great contender.  It's made of a dark chocolate and sweetened naturally with dates and organic agave nectar. I don't like plain dates, but I do like this bar. Two years ago, I learned my blood sugar was in the "diabetes" range so I've lost 30 pounds through healthy eating (1200 calories a day) of low-sugar, low-fat healthy foods and exercise and reversed the diabetes without medicine. Occasionally I want a taste of dark chocolate which is healthy for you--this bar meets that desire.<br /><br />I like the fact that this bar is sweetened naturally with no added sugar.  The natural sugar in this bar is 17g--one cup of milk is about 12g.  A cup of fruit juice is about 25g. So this bar is mid-range between milk and fruit juice.  A nutritionist said to think of sugar like poison for your body--your body burns sugar before it burns the fat so if you have too much fat, go light on sugar.  She recommended breakfast cereals that were under 8g of sugar, for example.  You might be satisfied with 1/2 of the bar (I was!) which would then be 8.5g of sugar and 1/2 the 190 calories or only 95 calories. I enjoyed the unusual texture for variety--and think it would be good cold, too.  You could keep some in the frig.<br /><br />The bar has 20% of daily fiber needs and 7g of protein.  As an alternative, I like Kashi's TLC Dark Mocha Almond Chewy Grandola Bars which are 6g of sugar and 130 calories with 1/2 the fat of these bars.  But you don't want crunchy bars all the time, so this Pure Natural Bar is a great alternative. It has a sorta brownie texture--or soft tootsie roll texture, kind of velvety. Family members sampled this bar,too, and liked it so it had wide appeal.  My Weight Watchers meeting tomorrow is going to be on snacks so I'm taking this box to the meeting to share with the group.

review/text: I am eating one of these Pure Natural Bars as I write this and I admit that aside from the occasional Lara bar, I do NOT eat any bars at all. I just don't really care for it. These were and still are delicious. They have the perfect level of sweetness, not too sweet which I couldn't tolerate and just nutty enough. I find they go excellent with a cup of Oolong tea and have been keeping me going in the afternoons. Love the taste and they seem really easy to digest to boot!

review/summary: Appearance is troubling, but quite good for the traveler
review/text: Since airplane meals are monopoly priced with a 90% probability of nasty, these 'energy' bars have become something akin to an MRE for the coach traveler. The varieties are endless and variably convenient and satisfying. These are quite good by comparison. Far more chocolaty then most, they are a bit disturbing in appearance resulting in the 4 stars but certainly a good choice. If the child that might sit beside you were to ask "what are eating?" the answer could determine the balance of the flight because the child will have a predictable child-like perspective.

review/summary: They're Not Candy
review/text: These bars are not intended to be as sweet as a Hostess snack cake. They are designed to give health-conscious folks a decent tasting snack that has more than chocolate and marshmallow in the ingredients. The flavor is not sugary-sweet, but the dark cocoa is definitely present and quite pleasing. By halfway through the bar, it's obvious that it's a health bar. That's not a bad thing for those of us into fitness. They're perfect. I eat one before a bike ride or a run and it seems to help with the 7g protien and 25g carbs.<br /><br />These are something I would buy even off the Vine program. I'm pretty sure I saw them at Trader Joe's, so I'm going to pick them up there. I recommend them as an additional source of protien and potassium while keeping the sugar in check.

review/summary: snacking healthy made easier
review/text: I've tried a variety of healthy snack bars such as Clif Nectars & Larabar.  I felt this was was very tasty and filling (contains 5 grams of fiber).  I like that it also has 7 grams of protein in each bar, no gluten, natural ingredients (some organic).  These are also kosher (OU dairy) & vegan.  I like the texture of the small pieces of almond and find the dates give it a sweetness without being too overpowering.  I've used these as a quick breakfast or snack while traveling and felt energized for a while.  Highly recommend for the gym bag, eating at home, or as a quick pick-me-up on the go.<br />Update: I finished up the box (had to hide them from others in the house I enjoyed them so much) but a little disappointed they are so pricey compared to other bars on the market.  Big difference between these and others is how much more healthy & filling these are, so it seems worth it, but wish they were a bit less per bar.

review/summary: You can really taste the protein
review/text: Pure Natural Chocolate Almond bars take some getting used to. It is a heavy bar. Small but dense. It actually looks like a fudge bar but has more of a brownie texture. It isn't sweet but it isn't bland either but you can really taste the protein in it.<br /><br />The first two bars that I ate, I could not finish them. Eating half was filling enough. I wasn't sold on it from those first two bars.<br /><br />But by the third bar (if taken with tea), I actually started to like the bars. I had to get used to the texture mostly because the taste itself was something that I like (not overly sweet) and with the tea, it made a nice combo and it made a good snack to tide me over for dinner.<br /><br />After a week of eating a bar a day, I can comfortably give it 4-stars.

review/text: These bars are branded as "Chocolate Almond" but the first ingredient is dates. I'm not terribly fond of dates, so that was disappointing. I found the bar to be "okay" ~ I'd eat it if I were starving or needed food, but I wouldn't purchase this product.<br /><br />My son took one small bite and won't eat any more because they're not chocolatey enough. His mom also didn't feel they were chocolatey enough. The chocolate is more like an aftertaste than a primary flavor.<br /><br />I would have given these bars a 2, but because they truly are very healthy I couldn't in good conscious rate them any lower. Summary: Less dates, more chocolate.<br /><br />Don't believe the "Chocolate Almond" brand... think of them more like "Healthy Date Almond With A Hint Of Chocolate."

review/summary: Too many tradeoffs
review/text: Perhaps the best thing that I can say about the Pure Natural Bars is that they are okay, not great and certainly NOT a substitute for a brownie or treat.  It might be a healthier alternative, but you're going to sacrifice taste (the first tradeoff).  No... contrary to the packaging claim, your chocolate prayers have NOT been answered.  I like a good rich dark chocolate, and this just has a weak, bitter flavor.  It's a bad taste, it's just weak.<br /><br />All natural ingredients make these bars an overall safer alternative for people that must concern themselves with allergic reactions, but then the texture of them makes you think that you're eating a very dense paste (tradeoff number two).<br /><br />I don't mind the fact that they taste the way they do, and I'm not exactly looking for something that reminds me of bakery brownies.  But I get a little tired of healthy snack makers making claims that simply do not hold up with the first bite of their product.  It would be great if a snack bar existed that had it's own unique taste instead of trying to mimic the high calorie sinful stuff.  For example, I've tried a number of "burger substitutes"; forget them!  On the other hand, there are some fantastic "vegetable patties" that fit comfortably on a hamburger bun and provide a healthy, lower calorie alternative to the juicy, fatty hamburger that I remember so fondly.<br /><br />Forget trying to answer someone's chocolate prayers!  Just create a healthy, all natural, high fiber, low calorie snack bar that can be consumed and enjoyed.  Really... it shouldn't be that difficult, unless you're trying to make "substitutes" instead of "alternatives".

review/summary: Not bad for a vegan gluten free bar
review/text: With a consistency like a Little Debbie Brownie and a taste like the no-Pudge brownies, these will not be for everyone. However, if you are on a restricted diet (no soy, no gluten, no dairy), these bars fit the bill. They are not overly sweet, although there are 25g of carbs in each bar. The main ingredient is dates, so that is what provides the majority of the texture. The bars soft and dense, sweetened with agave nectar with no other sugar added.  It does contain 5g of fiber and 7g of protein, but only has 10% iron and 4% calcium RDA.<br /><br />My biggest issue is the calorie impact: at 190 calories, I want something that has a little more flavor, especially if there is little added nutrition (these can't be used as meal replacement, just as an occasional snack). The wrapper says "Your chocolate prayers have been answered." I seriously doubt anyone eating this bar would agree with that statement.

review/summary: Taste Great, but Not a Health Food
review/text: These bars really hit the spot: they have a good consistency, like a very thick brownie or fudge, without being overly or cloyingly sweet. The texture is just right, and rich enough to feel like a treat. The chocolate taste is pronounced (and really more of a 'dark chocolate' than any kind of milk chocolate), and the almonds - while not particularly numerous - are present, and add an extra crunch and flavour to the bar. If you're a die-hard, need-a-chocolate-bar kind of person, it's likely these won't satisfy your sweet-tooth cravings; for the rest of us, it's the right amount of sweetness.<br /><br />It's important to keep in mind that the bars aren't really 'health food,' though: they're not nutrient-dense enough to be a meal replacement, and likely won't fit easily into a stringent diet regimen. They're calorically dense, at 190 calories/bar: not very big, either. They'd be great to bring on a hike, long bicycle ride, or run, though, as they're compact, portable, and taste good. I wish they had more fiber (because really, these aren't very filling), but am glad they don't contain a laundry list of random chemicals/fillers, nor do the bars have any soy. The protein count is fairly good (7g), considering the Pure Natural bars aren't being sold as as a protein supplement.

review/text: These bars are high in calories which is a good thing when hiking or performing some other strenuous exercise.  But they are not very high in flavor which is not such a good thing when eating them.  The bars are soft and have a brownie like texture.  The chocolate flavor is not pronounced, it is a dry cocoa flavor and texture.  Almond slivers are in the bars, there is a crunch every couple of bites, but the almond flavor is overpowered by the cocoa.  These are similar to other "health" bars in that they impart a chalky, dry texture.  No, my chocolate prayers were not answered by these bars.  The thing I liked about these is that they are not overly gooey and sweet.

Compared to Chobani, it again comes up short -- the single serving of Chobani has 14g of protein (28% of your Daily Value). The Chobani also has 20% of your daily calcium value. And if you thought a benefit of the Pure bar is that it is gluten-free, so is the Chobani.<br /><br />I know that this review seems like it has morphed into a pitch for Chobani, but my point is to illustrate that there are healthier, lower caloric snack foods out there. And the Chobani tastes a heck of a lot better.

review/summary: Had a lot of Bars in my life.... these are simply THE BEST!
review/text: I received these Bars as a part of the Amazon Vine Program.<br /><br />Here is what is GREAT about these Bars!<br /><br />1).  No Soy.  Thank you!  Every Bar out there has soy.  I cannot eat soy, these have no soy.<br /><br />2).  They taste great.  The chocolate is Cocoa.  Great for you... and they have a nice softness to them that make them a terrific mid-day snack.<br /><br />3).  7 Grams of Protein.  Nuf said.<br /><br />4).  Simple Ingredients.  The Ingredients are: Dates, Almonds, Organic Agave Nectar, Organice Rice Protein Concentrate, Cocoa (Dutched), Chia Seeds, Organic Agave fiber, Natural Flavors.  Tired of Bars filled with Junk?  Then these are for you.<br /><br />6).  OH, and the price?...... The price is right.  $16.98 for 12 Bars.  Do the math.  These are a really great deal..

review/summary: "For those of you who like this kind of thing, this is the kind of thing you will like."
review/text: For those who really know nutrition, protein bars are a nightmare. Often filled with multiple sugar sources and nasty additives, protein bars run the gamut from truly healthy to downright bad for you. "Pure Naturals" Chocolate Almond Bar lands squarely in the second tier: Simple, semi-organic, some nutrition and reasonably tasty.<br /><br />NUTRITION: If you're looking for a lot of any one thing this ain't the bar for you. There's 7 grams of protein (albeit from organic rice protein instead of chemically extracted), which is nothing too spectacular but decent. 5 grams of fiber, again not bad. 10% of your iron and 320 mg of potassium but negligible on other nutrients. Sugars are 17 grams a bar; I've seen much worse. Chia seeds will give you a small amount of healthy fats and organic agave is the only sweetener. Downsides? The first two ingredients are not organic and they make up most of the bar. "Natural flavors" are used, never a good thing, and the cocoa is dutch processed which eliminates some antioxidant content. Other than that no real complaints. Nutrition grade: B<br /><br />ALLERGENS: Made on shared equipment but labeled as gluten-free. No soy-derived ingredients that I could spot (watch out for those "natural flavors"). Obviously if you have a nut allergy you'll have to skip this line, but other than that the ingredient list is pretty straight-forward and clean.<br /><br />TASTE: This is easily the best tasting of the "Pure Naturals" series. It tastes like a gluten-free brownie, let's put it that way. Heat it up with a little coconut milk ice cream and you got a decent dessert. Not as yummy as the Zing Chocolate Coconut Bar, but better than a lot of the Larabars. Taste Grade: B/B-<br /><br />There you have it, hope that helps those of you desperate for a new bar that will work for your diet. Overall not bad tasting and decent ingredients. Happy snacking!<br /><br />FINAL GRADE: B/B-

review/summary: yummy breakfast solution!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by these bars.  Usually nutritional snack bars, particularly gluten-free vegan bars, are mediocre to terrible.  Pure Natural Chocolate Almond bars are delicious!  They consist primarily of dates, like chocolatey Fig Newtons.  The almonds provide a satisfying crunch.  The bars are 190 calories, 25g of carbs (unfortunately, 17g of those are sugars, which is why these bars get 4 stars instead of 5), 7g of protein, and 8g of fat (only 1g saturated).  The bars are filling as well - they could easily get you through from breakfast to lunch, or provide a good afternoon snack.  And because they're gluten-free, they won't bloat you.  If you're looking for a candy-bar-like 'nutrition' bar, look elsewhere. You won't find milk chocolate or drizzled caramel here.  But if you're looking for a delicious, much lower carb option than a Clif Bar, give these a try.

review/summary: Tasty for chocolate lovers, but more figgy
review/text: I liked both the taste and texture or these bars, however, one non-chocolate lover in the house did not. It kind of reminded me of figs, and less so of chocolate, but I guess that is what Dutch chocolate tastes like. (Figs are NOT an ingredient.)  There is a special link between texture and chewing, and I found that I took smaller bites and chewed more with this product which left me with a very satisfied feeling. Overall, enjoyable...and good for you.  The inner box (the box pictured) didn't hold up that well in shipment, but it wasn't an issue since the bars are soft.  Just a hint: you will need to brush your teeth afterward to dislodge some of the almond chips.<br /><br />People with allergies should read the label before purchasing.  If that information isn't posted, post a comment and I'll update this review.<br /><br />A great snack bar for the purse or backpack for people on the go.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Good and good for you
review/text: This has a smooth, moist, almost brownie-like taste and texture, not at all like other vegan bars, which are too often dry and gritty. The Pure Natural has a light chocolate center without an overly sweet, sugary taste. After my first bar, I immediately wanted to have another. My granddaughter should love this bar -- she requires a gluten-free diet -- but even if the gluten issue isn't relevant for you, Pure Natural is a good choice. I didn't give it 5 stars only because I'm not a big fan of almonds in my food (they're fine eaten separately), but I realize this won't matter to most people.

review/summary: Not So Much Chocolate---fruit and nut bar "Hint of chocolate"
review/text: It does ~look~ like a chocolate bar if that is what they are meaning by chocolate.  Over all the bar is good but it should not claim that it is "chocolate" as it needs twice as much cocoa in it!  The hint of chocolate flavor is immediately overwhelmed by a very sweet date/agave flavor, which almost tasted like prunes to me(good thing I like them).  After the first bite I no longer tasted the chocolate.<br /><br />On the other hand my kids liked the bars and said they were yummy and would like to eat them again.  It was nice for them that there were no big nut pieces because they would have refused to eat them.  They chose to take pieces off of the bar that is super soft and roll it into balls-fun!<br /><br />I love that the bar is vegan and gluten-free.<br />Bar: 8g fat, 25 carb, 17 sugars, and 7g protein.

review/summary: Awesome awesome awesome
review/text: The first thing I noticed about these chocolate almond bars is they arrived on a 90+ degree day and weren't melted! That answered any questions I had as to how well they would travel.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was the ingredients list: Dates, almonds, organic agave nectar, organic rice protein concentrate, cocoa (dutched), chia seeds, organic agave fiber, and natural flavors.<br /><br />I was impressed. In case you don't know, agave is a sweetener that's low on the glycemic index (although dates may be pretty high -- sources differ). And chia seeds are high in EFAs. Each 1.7 oz. bar has 190 calories, with 7 grams of protein and 8 grams of fat, much of which is healthy fat from the almonds and chia seeds.<br /><br />What's most impressive is the taste and texture. They're chewy, but pleasantly so -- not tough like some protein bars tend to be. And the flavor and overall texture is like a really, really good chocolate brownie.<br /><br />In other words, these bars are great!

review/summary: Decent taste, Split opinions
review/text: It is what it is. It's not a "chocolate bar" as the average American might think of. It is not a brownie. It is not a granola bar. It is a chewy bar composed of finely chopped almonds, dates, Dutch cocoa (which you can taste), Chia seeds, Fiber and sweetened with Agave Nectar.<br /><br />At 190 calories a bar, 8 grams of total fat, 25 grams of carbs, and 7 grams of protein, it makes for a healthful snack (or even breakfast). The fats are good ones, though.<br /><br />Our family was mixed in their reviews. My husband said he has tasted better bars at Sam's Club, I thought it was decent (though I wouldn't eat them regularly), my seven-year-old son loved them and was excited he would be eating the remaining ten bars, and my two-year-old daughter liked the bar as well.<br /><br />They are vegan (though we are not), and gluten-free. My son has a gluten sensitivity, so it is nice to have a snack he loves that would not aggrevate his body.<br /><br />Apparently these were founded by a lady who has a six-year-old vegetarian.<br /><br />Overall, they were good, but I don't know that they answer the claim on the box which reads, "Your chocolate prayers have been answered."

review/summary: A good-tasting gimmick
review/text: Marketers know that if they slap "pure" and "natural" on anything, there's a segment of consumer that's automatically going to snarf them up.  Well, at least the people behind these bars seem to be doing it without cynicism.  They are gluten-free, vegan and the box they come in is even 100% recycled.  What's more, they taste pretty good as far as healthy snack bars go.<br /><br />I passed them out around the office to get a wide range of opinions.  Everyone liked the taste, and the bars were compared favorably to Clif Bars.  To me, they have some of the same chalky, dry texture as Clif Bars, although to a lesser degree.  No, this isn't going to win head-to-head with a brownie, but it is soft and mildly sweet and certainly healthier.  I ate one as a desert after lunch today and it was quite satisfying.<br /><br />Why would you want something vegan-friendly and gluten-free if you're not a vegan or a sufferer of Celiac disease?  Well, from the research I've seen, gluten messes with the gut of even people without celiacs.  So probably good to avoid.  And the vegan aesthetic, when done right, is better for the planet as a whole, vegans and non-vegans alike.  Win-win.<br /><br />Ingredients: dates, almonds, agave nectar, rice protein concentrate, cocoa (dutched), chia seeds, agave fiber, natural flavors.  Dates and agave are two of the healthiest sweeteners; almonds are supposedly one of the best nuts in terms of heart health; chia seeds are reputed to be good for skin.<br /><br />I try to stay low-carb.  You will get 25g of carbs in a bar, probably from the rice protein concentrate.  The other positives about the ingredients probably outweigh this factor for most people, but it is something else to be aware of.  A lot of sins can be hidden under the name "natural flavors" too, but I'm willing to give Pure Naturals the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Overall, this is the best snack bar I've encountered in terms of both ingredients and taste.  Eat responsibly.

review/summary: Better After a Few Bites
review/text: My first few bites were a bit chewy and dry.  I didn't enjoy it so much.  I suppose I was expecting more flavor.<br /><br />But ...<br /><br />After a few minutes and a drink of water later, I quite liked these bars.  They're a bit dense so I found they were filling when paired with a fruit.  Also, the chocolate in question is like a brownie and basically cocoa in flavor, not rich chocolate, which is what I was expecting.  As a result, the chocolate flavor is subtle, and I liked that because it makes this feel like a healthy option and it is not overpowering.  The almonds could have been more pronounced instead of being just sort of present here or there.  For a sweet tooth, not the option I'd go with, but if you like a bit of cocoa flavor and a snack option that's not going to kill your diet and is organic, this is a decent option.  Just make sure you have something to drink with it because it is chewy and a little dry.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: My son is ultra-picky.  He tried Pure Natural Bars and said they were "not bad."  I asked him if he would eat it for a snack and he said no, but he would eat it if he was very hungry and there was nothing else to eat.<br /><br />I agree.  They are not bad.  Not great, either.  They're chewy, not too sweet (a good thing).  The almonds are there but not that noticeable.  I can say the same about the chocolate.  The texture makes me feel like I'm eating a bar of fiber.  Maybe that's why I'm not over the moon about it.

review/summary: I Liked it Okay, but it was a No-Go with my kids
review/text: The wrapper for<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OV6X6Q">Pure Natural Bars, Chocolate Almond, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> shows a bar with whole almonds and chunks of dark chocolate, so it was quite the surprise to open the wrapper to find a soft, squishy brown bar with pieces of almonds throughout.  Looks aside, I didn't find the taste of this all natural bar with 7 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber to taste all that bad.<br /><br />However, without being told the ingredients, my children immediately picked up that there was "prune-like" fruit mixed in this chocolate bars and they turned up their noises at both the taste and the texture. (And they are not picky eaters)  Turns out that the first ingredient listed for this chocolate bar is dates.<br /><br />And, although the ingredients seem allergy friendly (ingredients are: dates, almonds, organic agave nectar, organic rice protein concentrate, cocoa, chia seeds, organic agave fiber and natural flavors), the package is clearly marked that the product is made in a facility that processes milk, eggs, wheat and peanuts. I think my friends with highly allergic kids would not take the risk of trying this product because of that fact.<br /><br />All that being said, I think my husband and I will enjoy having these bars around for a quick on-the-go breakfast or snack.

review/summary: Somewhat tasty but mostly mediocre.
review/text: These are supposed to be healthy vegan nutrition chocolate bars. If they tasted really good then I would ignore the calories and fat content. But they taste mediocre at best with a gritty texture which I suspect are the ground up fiber or almonds. The box shows whole almonds but there are no whole almonds in these bars. They also don't really have that rich dark chocolate taste either. I usually eat Kellog's Fiber Plus bars which actually taste quite good and definitely taste better than these Pure Naturals bars.<br /><br />When comparing Calories, Fat, Protein, Fiber and Vitamins, it is about a draw between the Pure Naturals and the Kellog's Fiber Plus. The Kellog's Fiber Plus bar has fewer calories per bar 130 vs 190, fewer fat calories 35 vs 70, more fiber 9g vs 5g and more Vitamin E and Zinc. But the Kellog's Fiber Plus also has more Saturated fat 3g vs 1g and fewer Proteins 2g vs 7g.<br /><br />Another problem is that the Pure Natural bars are promoted as Gluten-Free, Vegan and Natural Ingredients. I'll give them the Natural but they are processed in a plant that also processes Wheat, Peanuts, Soy, Sesame so that negates the Gluten-Free statement. The only plus I can find to these bars is that they use only natural or organic ingredients.<br /><br />I definitely would not call either bar healthy but if you have to have a chocolate bar then they are better for you than your typical chocolate bar. I would recommend trying the Kellog's Fiber Plus first and if not to your liking then try the Pure Naturals bars. Will I eat them, sure but will I buy the Pure Natural bars, not likely as they are very costly compared to the Kellog's Fiber Plus.

review/summary: Ginger Soy Soba Noodles are FANTASTIC!
review/text: One of the thing I don't like about the Amazon review system is that it often lumps together reviews of similar products (which aren't really at all similar).  This is the case w/Annie Chun products.  On the Ginger Soy Soba Noodles page, there are 17 customer reviews, almost none of which refer to this specific product, but to another Annie Chun product/flavor.  That's too bad because customers should be able to see reviews just for that product.<br /><br />This review is for the Ginger Soy Soba noodle kit.  It was absolutely FANTASTIC and I'm ordering more.  The flavor is great - nice blend of soy & ginger (actual chunks of ginger too), the noodles are super tasty (and healthy - much more protein than a lot of Annie's other noodles), and preparation is very quick/easy.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the noodles are only 7" long so you don't have to break them to fit them in a medium saucepan.<br /><br />Note, there are not microwave instructions as the noodles need boiling for 3-4 minutes.  But, that's it.  Then you just mix in the sauce (and optional oil packet - you can use less of it to reduce fat).

Some aren't too bad when doctored with some soy sauce, hot sauce, or other sauce. And some aren't too bad for ease of preparation.<br /><br />This one isn't easily doctored, nor is it that fast/simple to make. Therefore I don't see any reason to keep in the pantry. If I don't feel like spending 20-30 minutes to make my own Asian food from scratch, I'll stick with better/easier ready-made products to keep on hand.

review/text: We used to eat these pancakes every week with fruit instead of syrup. We have introduced our friends to these. Amazing that such health and flavor could come from a complete pancake mix.<br /><br />Unfortunately it seems that Kellog's now owns Krusteaz and they changed the recipe approximately in Fall 2011. Here are some of the changes:<br /><br />- Sugar almost doubled.<br />- Fat up by 33%.<br />- Salt up by 8%.<br /><br />Hmm, so much for my tasty healthy alternative. Seems like there were plenty of to-sweet pancakes available on the market that appeal to children.<br /><br />The new recipe mix currently says "Improved Taste" on the package. I wish I could find a source for the old recipe and buy enough to last to the use-by date. There does not seem to be any way to ask Amazon sellers details like this about what they are selling.<br /><br />The new recipe is still the best tasting pancake mix that we can find, but how can you want that much sugar in something you are going to pour syrup over? We are looking for an alternative.

review/text: This is the second brand of pumpkin spice coffee that I've purchased and it is out of this world.  I feel like I'm having a warm piece of pumpkin pie. It's very rich and smooth and tastes the same cup after cup.

review/summary: NOT Pumkin Spice Coffee
review/text: Just tried this Pumkin Spice Coffee.  Spouse said it left an after taste.  I couldn't taste the Pumkin -- the only reason to buy Pumkin Spice coffee.  Label says its Low Acidic -- that's a plus if the coffee was better.  Bean Coffee Engineer's have some work to do on this Pumkin Blend.<br /><br />PROBLEM:  We got use to GODAVIA, Pumkin Spice Coffee which is the VERY VERY BEST!  Unfortunately it is also $$$$$ VERY Pricey.

review/text: If you like medium or dark roast, this is not for you.  Only slight pumpkin spice flavoring and weak coffee taste.<br />I will have to double up the scoops to achieve the flavor I want.  It is less acidic which is easier on a sensitive stomach.

review/summary: Seeking pumpkin?
review/text: I have been looking for pumpkin spice coffee that really has a good flavor to it and bought this because of the reviews.  I opened the bag and was surprised to find no smell that hinted the presence of anything other than normal coffee. I made a pot of coffee and still, nothing in the flavor or smell to suggest it is anything other than normal coffee.<br /><br />The coffee itself is ok, but the product isn't at all as described. Given the reviews, I find myself wondering if a mistake of some kind happened during the busy holiday season, and I was sent plain coffee with a pumpkin spice sticker on it.

review/text: Great coffee with no bitter aftertaste and delicious pumpkin flavor. I used it in an eggnog latte and it was a hit in our house!  The only negative is that it doesn't come with a way to reseal the bag i.e. a tin tie or sticker. I used the tin tie from another coffee bag and that worked just fine.<br />If you like pumpkin and coffee you won't regret the purchase. While I did buy it during a lightening deal, I would buy again even at full price.

review/text: I'm a fan of flavored coffee and The Bean's pumpkin spice is the best I've tasted.  Subtle not overpowering.  I'm enjoying a cup of it right now along with a toasted cranberry-orange bagel with light cream cheese on this cool, crisp, autumn day. I love the low acid and high anti-oxidant content.  It's an added bonus. I didn't know the difference until I tasted it. This is a good one.

review/summary: So Far So Good
review/text: I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.

review/summary: Best Cat Food
review/text: I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his "spunk" so I decided it was time to start buying him "real" cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!

review/text: I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select.

review/summary: Perfect Cat Food For Older Cats!
review/text: This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.

review/summary: Good for Feline UTI
review/text: I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me.

review/summary: Palatable and healthy
review/text: Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.

review/text: My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!

review/summary: Wonderful Stuff!
review/text: I have been using Giovanni Body Wash (White Tea scent) for several years now. I have extremely sensitive skin, prone to acne, rashes and irritations when using most other soaps. I have wasted tons of money trying soap after soap hoping to find something that wouldn't irritate my skin, lathering well, while leaving me feeling clean. This soap has a really nice, soft scent, washes skin clean of dirt and oil and leaves no soap scum after rinsed off. This is the only soap I have found that does not cause break-outs/irritations and lathers well. I truely wish I could find a more econonmcal product that does the same job as this body wash but still haven't found one. So I try to find really good deals when buying this body wash to help off set the cost.<br /><br />Please note: this soap is a little drying.. so if you already have a dry skin conidtion this may not be the soap for you. I lived in a very warm humid climate when I started using this soap and did not notice the drying effect until I moved to a much cooler and dryer area. With that being said Giovanni also sells one of the best moisturizers I have ever used, it's their body butter (comes in the same scents as the body washes). This body butter works fantasticly! I am in the health care field and have to wash my hands many, many times a day. If I put some of the body butter on at night right before I go to sleep, my hands are moisturized all the next day without reapplying! I have tried many moisturizers that seems to work great until you wash your hands, then its like you never had any on in the first place... the body butter is not like this.

review/summary: Where's the moisture?
review/text: Ok, so I absolutely love the packaging and the nifty description on the back of the bottle, but when I'm paying .64/oz, I expect it to moisturize. Giovanni claims that their washes include "essential oil complex to soothe, smooth and regenerate skin's lost moisture" but the ingredients' list contains no such ingredient, unless they are referring to the "Essential Oil Fragrance" in which case they are blatantly lying because essential oils provide scent, not moisture. Even the dollar bottles of cheapo wash at Walmart contain some type of moisturizer, albeit petroleum. Sometimes I use St. Ives Whipped Silk body wash and it's definitely more moisturizing than Giovanni due to the sunflower oil. I've noticed even JASON's washes contain Sodium PCA to moisturize (although their stuff also has harsh sulfates, so I've never tried them). Or maybe Giovanni deliberately left out any moisturizers out so that we buy their lotions/body butters. Ha!<br /><br />While I sound like I hate the product, I really don't; I just wish it provided some moisture. The good: it looks and feels like a spa product, washes well and rinses cleanly, and smells good and not artificial perfumey like Herbal Essences and all that other junk. Also, it actually works well as a shampoo when in a pinch. In fact, I've taken to using it as shampoo as well since Giovanni keeps changing their shampoo formulas (and for the worse, it seems, judging from the new ingredients) and body washes tend to be more gentle than shampoos. I've tried Raspberry Winter, Lavender Vanilla Snow, Cassifluer White Tea, and D:tox (bar soap form) and they all smell awesome. True aromatherapy in a bottle.

review/text: I absolutely love coffee but most of the time it makes me jittery. Over the years I've tried different Teeccino flavors and this one is BY FAR the best! It's closest to the taste of real coffee even though it's chocolate flavored, it's really smooth and light on the stomach, and the SMELL is so good when you first take it out of the packet! I love the "tee bags" they are making now because I can get the same brew every time-I steep mine for 3 minutes and dunk it 10-15 times, then add raw honey and cream. SO DELICIOUS!

review/summary: A Very Satisfying Cup of "coffee"... Finally!
review/text: I have been needing to give up coffee due to the acidity. I have tried several "low acid" coffees as well as made my own "Cold brew" coffee concentrate. Nothing was quite what I needed where flavor was concerned, and most were still upsetting my stomach. I had already given up the caffeine, so that was not an issue. When I saw the favorible reviews of the Teeccino products, I decided to give them a try. I sampled these "Tee Bags" first, as they came in a small box, so I figured if I did not like them, I wasn't out much.<br /><br />I cannot believe how much I LOVED this product! The Tee Bags make it super easy to prepare, and the aroma was great from the moment I tore open the little envelope. The flavor really is wonderful! Very rich and satisfying! I added a little flavored creamer to mine, just as I would with coffee and it was delicious. I am very surprised at just how much this tasted like coffee. It is my new favorite product. I highly recommend it to anyone having to give up coffee. I am looking forward to trying the "ground, brew your own" version, as well as the other flavors.

review/summary: Very smooth delicate flavor, great CHAI TEA
review/text: I just bought my first box of this, being a sort of STASH CHAI addict, drinking the BLACK CHIA TEA, and the GREEN CHIA TEA, both of which are good. So, you like CHAI? great. The box lists the same spices for each box, but they are in different ratios, depending on the strenght of the backround tea. The black tea, uses ginger, then cinnamon, clove, allspice, nutmeg, and cardamon, in decreasing amounts of spice, as you decend down the spice list. (altho the company also uses spice oils, for the teas, for more flavor.) The green tea CHIA as more cinnamon in it, compaired to the black chia. NOW, for the WHITE CHIA. SPICES AS  FOLLOWS, its mostly CINNAMON, then ginger, allspice, clove, nutmeg, and cardamon. ALL real CHIA teas, use these spices, but they need to be balanced to the teas, and WHITE TEA, is very delicate tea, of course. ALso, since it is even less processed than GREEN TEA, its very easy to make it bitter.  (It has more antioxidants than green tea too.) SO, if you get this, and you want it to taste good, dont throw BOILING WATER on the tea bag(s). Let your water sit for a minute, until its around 190 degrees F. THEN, add your tea bags, and dont let it brew for more than FOUR MINUTES. THEN, like ALL CHIA TEA, it must be VERY sweet, for the spices to "work". I add asparteme, and LOTS of it ,and a bit of honey, and some SOY MILK....ALL DONE!!! Stash's chia tea is the best, the VERY BEST. I tasted them all. There's no black pepper, chicory, or other wierdness.  SO, even tho with white chia you only get 18 bags of tea per box, instead of 20 with the GREEN or BLACK CHIA, its worth the few extra pennies for this tea. BUT, first, do you like WHITE TEA, and DO YOU LIKE SPICES? (and if you dont like to sweeten your tea, or add milk/soy, just stay away from CHIA. ) PS. dont make this the old TIBETIAN way, cos you dont want to BOIL white tea.

review/summary: Love Chai
review/text: I absolutely love this tea. I usually mix the black and white chai teas together. White tea is really good for you..<br />However, to my disappointment.. Everytime I order this tea, I get sent the wrong one. Instead I've received two boxes (containing 6 packages) of "Organic Premium White Tea".. Which, is not the same at all.. Huge disappointment with my order, though no hard feelings to Amazon - they did all they could. I still absolutely love this tea and would recommend it to any chai lover!

review/summary: Above-average quality at an affordable price
review/text: The truth is, you almost always get what you are paying for. In the case of this product, you are a bit above the average 'value' curve. It's not my 'number one' white tea but it is a solid 'number two'. The kind I drink almost like I drink water, several cups a day.<br /><br />The 'Stash Premium Tea' is not top of the line 'premium' but I enjoy drinking it. I guess, I could call it my 'staple' tea. Since I'm not into 'flavors', I actually have a subscription for the plain variety. These teas, I drink them every now and then or serve them to guests who may care for cup but they are not my daily drink.<br /><br />And, just in case someone did not know, there's nothing special about 'chai'. Translated into English, 'chai' means 'tea'.

review/summary: Not my cup of tea
review/text: This product may be exactly what is described but I don't like the taste. For me it has too much clove taste and is almost medicinal in its strength. After steeping three minutes I couldn't finish the cup. With a two minute steep I could tolerate it but I know I won't finish all the boxes. I wish I could have found it at my local store to try first before buying so much.<br />I like Chai flavored creamers so I should have just ordered plain white tea and added that. The positive ratings made it sound good but for me the spice flavor is overpowering (like euclayptus menthol).

review/text: The jams and jellies were very good. It's nice to take to picnics, the beach, and lunch! You don't have to pre-make the sandwiches so the bread doesn't get all soggy by the time you eat it.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars because there is only 40 of the yummy strawberry jams and 80 of the grape and mixed fruits.  They are also pretty small, so to make a peanut-butter-jelly-sandwich, you need 3-4 of the jellies to make it nice and gooey!<br /><br />But overall, very tasty!

We have a whole lot left after a 14 day trip.

I think it was a good value for the price and the convenience of the product.<br />I got the order quickly and had no problems with the product or seller.

review/summary: single serving brownies
review/text: As a lifetime member of Weight Watchers, I know that a pan of brownies in the house can easily lead to a pan of brownies in my belly.  What I love about No Pudge is that you can make a single serving.  Directions are on the box.  I mix two tablespoons of my favorite lowfat yogurt (the BEST is Axelrod black cherry - which makes this a Black Forest brownie) with 1/4 cup No Pudge mix and pop it in the micro for two minutes. This is a double brownie.  The single brownie is too dinkie to satisfy me.  Then I slather the rest of the yogurt over the brownie.  The creamy yogurt mixes through the chewy brownie and is my hands down favorite send my belly to bed happy nighttime snack.  5 weight watchers points with the double serving and yogurt.

review/summary: Easy, quick and consistantly delicious brownies every time!
review/text: Trader Joe's has been carrying the No Pudge Brownie mixes for over a decade and it's not unusual to see customers buying them by the case.  At the current price of $15.55 for 6 that makes them $2.59 a pack if you have Amazon prime or use Super Saver Free shipping and that's not a bad deal.  What mnakes these brownies so popular is that all you have to add is yogurt.  I add Vanilla Nonfat yogurt and sometimes I'll toss in two tablespoons of instant coffee of espresso powder to jazz them up.  You don't need butter or eggs - just the yogurt.  Once you do that, you stir 'em up, pour 'em in the pan and in no time you have delicious brownies!  They aren't as ooey-gooey as some mixes but that's what I like about them.  They also aren't cloyingly sweet.  They are simply a nice, fudgey brownie that you don't have to feel too guilty about eating. I always keep a couple packages in the pantry to whip up for unexpected company or for whenever that chocolate craving hits you out of nowhere.  The best thing about No Pudge Fudge Brownies is that they are easy to mix, quick to cook and they always come out to be the same good and fudgey brownie you are longing for. Keep some on hand at all times!

review/summary: No Guilt, Sinfully, Chocolate-y Brownie
review/text: My husband and I are crazy about these brownies! They are fresh and ready to eat in no time at all with a chewy, gooey, chocolate-y flavor.  I like to add a scoop of Frozen Cherry Yogurt to the top of the still-warm brownie.<br /><br />Did I tell you how easy they are to mix-up? The package is complete. You just add some yogurt.  And the best part...it's easy to just mix enough for a couple of brownies and then pop them in the microwave.  That's if you don't want to mix up (and probably eat) the whole pan at once.<br /><br />I also like the packaging for these.  The boxes stand up easily in my pantry and because of the hot pink color they are always very easy to find.  These are a wonderful treat that you really don't have to feel bad about enjoying. I give them 4 stars only because I think they are a bit pricey...but then, as we all know, usually you get what you pay for. Recommended!

review/summary: Natural, convenient, and yummy
review/text: I don't typically buy foods that are advertised as non-fat for precisely the reasons that a previous reviewer mentioned--they're gummy, barely taste like what they're supposed to taste like, and just generally disgusting.  I also don't like fat-free foods because of all the chemicals and added sugar that usually goes into them to give them something resembling their full-fat texture.<br /><br />This product really is different from all those other fat-free products, though, and I genuinely enjoy it.  The ingredients are all things I typically would keep in my cupboard without feeling the need for a biohazard sticker on the door (if only I had time to bake).<br /><br />The fact that one can make an easy single-serving brownie in the microwave is an added bonus for all of us who don't live with a big family of people who will eat our homemade creations, or who simply don't have time to make a pan of homemade brownies.  I concede that these are not as good as a gourmet fudge brownie, but they are precisely what I'd hoped they'd be when I got them: yummy, quick, easy, economical, and above all chocolatey.<br /><br />My favorite serving suggestion: drop a few chocolate chips in the cup before putting them in to bake.

review/text: No Pudge brownies are AMAZING. They truly taste just as good as brownies with all the lovely fat in them. These are all natural, too--as in, the ingredients are few, and consist of normal things you have in your pantry. No 15+ letter chemicals here. All you need to add is 5 1/2 oz fat-free french vanilla yogurt. These brownies come out VERY chewy, so if you like yours softer, double the amount of yogurt. And check out their website for other recipe ideas!<br /><br />Seriously--you're not going to buy six boxes only to find out they taste like cardboard. They're FAT free, not sugar and taste free. You will want to tell everyone you know that this mix exists! Delicious!!

review/summary: AMAZING fat free brownies
review/text: I am currently on Weight Watchers, and originally saw people raving about these brownies on the message boards there.  I decided to try them out, and they were AMAZING.  You just add fat free vanilla yogurt (or even water, applesauce, or sour cream if you have no yogurt at the time), bake and ENJOY!!  I got the original version, and then added a tsp of mint and they were AMAZING.  Super chocolatey & chewy and there are a number of ways to tweak the recipe to your liking--like adding shredded coconut, bailey's, caramel sauce, etc.  I will say over $5/ box is kinda pricey, but they are hard to find at a lot of grocery stores, so this might be your best bet.  The 6-packs are a very good deal, so I would recommend that over the single box....trust me, it will be worth it!!!

review/summary: I wanted to hate these...
review/text: It was 11 pm on a Monday.  Someone sent me an e-mail detailing the waffles and berry sauce she was going to prepare for a weekend brunch.  My mouth began to water just as I was getting ready to head to bed.  Darn it!<br /><br />A subletter in my student apartment had left No Pudge brownie mix in my cabinet, and when I came back from the summer break, I almost threw out the box when I saw it.  I typically don't buy anything low-fat or non-fat, as I prefer to recognize the ingredients in whatever food I purchase and eat.  (The "everything in moderation" motto of my 88-year-old grandmother has worn off.  For my healthy under-30-year-old self, a little butter is fine in a fruit and veggie-rich diet short on processed foods.)<br /><br />Anyway, there was nothing around to satisfy my sudden must-have-chocolate attack.  The pink box called out to me from the back of the cabinet, and I winced.  No Ghirardelli in sight.  Low-fat chocolate?  Well, if I must.  I figured the brownies would be horrible but satisfy a craving, and that I could then pitch the rest of the pan.<br /><br />Not the case!  The craving hit at 10:55 pm, and I was cutting the brownies (having added *regular* Brown Cow plain yogurt with a tsp+ of natural vanilla) at 11:40.  They were really good warm.  The next day, completely cooled, they were even better!  I actually think that that chocolate taste of these is much better than any brownie mix I've ever encountered.  With the yogurt I used, the consistency was more cake-like than chewy, but I'll deal with that minor shortcoming.  These were awesome, and I'll be buying a supply of my own!
