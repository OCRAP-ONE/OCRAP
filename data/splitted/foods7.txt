review/summary: Nothing like actual Muesli
review/text: On a trip to Italy, muesli is what all the hotels had for breakfast as their cold cereal and I loved it.  Imagine how excited I was when I saw that Kellog's sold this product.  What did I learn?: despite the similar name, this cereal is quite unlike European-style muesli.  While the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all.<br /><br />"Real" muesli is made of rolled (not flaked) grains; this has pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, milk does not turn European mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals.  On the minus side, European mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so (i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side.  For those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones.  (Rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend "time-to-mushiness.")  And certainly only the Kellog's product contains HFCS.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from Amazon (or better yet, single boxes from a local health-foods store if you have one) and see what you prefer.  I eat the Bob's Red Mill product available on Amazon (and one of my local grocery chains) instead of this, and am much more satisfied.  I haven't tried Familia (but I'm not crazy about the idea of the "fruit flakes"), and the Dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me.  The other products are a hair more expensive than the Kellog's, but I'm willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product.<br /><br />I'm surprised Quaker doesn't sell a muesli product...  Given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the U.S., you'd think it would be a natural fit for them.

review/summary: SUPERIOR HARD-TO-FIND PRODUCT
review/text: I bought this product online because, although it is a Kellogg cereal, I cannot find a retail store which carries it, and incidentally I would like to know why. I called Kellogg and they could really give me no good answer, and suggested I try another product of theirs, which i found not as good as this. I appreciate that Amazon offers this, and I will continue to order it.  By the way,  it really keeps me "regular", better than any other cereal.  Try it, you'll like it.

review/summary: Buyer Beware!This product contains High Fructose Corn Syrup!
review/text: It's no secret that high fructose corn syrup is detrimental to your health. Unfortunately, it's also no secret that it has replaced other forms of sugar in a disturbingly large number of manufactured foods. Even worse is that most high fructose corn syrup is made from genetically modified corn.<br /><br />Since the late 1980s, HFCS has replaced regular table sugar, honey, and similar sweeteners in practically everything. Prolonged consumption of HFCS is now the topic of much debate and we are learning that it can cause long-term damage to the body.<br />High Fructose Corn Syrup Dangers<br /><br />1. Significant Risk of Weight Gain & Obesity<br />2. Increased Risk of Developing Type-2 Diabetes<br />3. Hypertension and Elevated "Bad" Cholesterol Levels<br />4.  Long-Term Liver Damage<br />5. Mercury Exposure from HFCS<br /><br />Kelloggs and other manufacturers know this and are slowly getting rid of this sweetner. Look at the cover of Post Rain Bran. They are advertising that it contains NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.I applaud them for this. High Fructose Corn Syrup is made from genetically modified corn from Monsanto which uses systemic pesticides in their seeds which is causing Colony collapse disorder in bees. I am a bee keeper and have been avoiding all products with HFCS in them to save my family and the bees. Watch vanishing of the Bees,Food Matters and Food Inc. They are all sold on Amazon. Excellent movies which will change your health dramatically and the way you think and eat.

review/summary: Have not tried product.... however...
review/text: They claim this product is "unadulterated", which would make you think "oh! sweet! it's going to be the BEST, because nobody else's coconut oil says it's "unadulterated".  I checked out their website, and for those of you who don't know... you want to go for COLD PRESSED oils. If they're not cold pressed, it means they've been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. Their site posts information on their extraction process. As of today, this is what it states:<br /><br />""Manila Coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, state-of-the-art mechanical expeller (Manila VirginFlo), thermo-stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible (0.1%) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions. Our oils are 1st and 2nd stage press-induced, without chemical solvents, no bleaching, no deodorizing, no hydrogenation, no fermentation enzymes - to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste. This method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high (up to 170 degrees Celsius) heat temperatures.""<br /><br />Mechanical Expeller is their form of extraction. And they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as "unadulterated" as their information on their products on Amazon make them sound. I will be steering clear of their products.<br /><br />I'm sorry if my review offends some, but if you're going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. I would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one. I was looking for larger quantities, which is why I looked at this product, however I will be sticking with Nutiva. As their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. The information below is direct from their website.<br /><br />""What makes Nutiva's virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is cold-pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutiva's approach preserves as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.""<br /><br />If you don't care about how it's processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils. If you want to read some scary things, look up the dark information on how those are processed. YUCK! Talk about horrifying.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br />-Amy<br /><br />PS. I used to be one of those "organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? Think you're more special than anybody else?" people. But I have learned so much in the past year and a half, dealing with my son's allergies and intollerances. There's more to it than "oh it's more expensive, so it's just making me feel special because I can afford it." No. There's WAY more to it than that. I urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. It's a way of life, a healthier way of life. We all deserve to live healthier. If you live healthier, even though it costs more, in the long term you're saving money because you are healthier. So that means less doctor visits, less expensive (and nasty harmful) medications, etc.

I sent the licorice and lemon flavors to my father, and he called me to ask where I'd gotten it, because his neighbor wanted to get some for his wife, too.  Once tried, you will be addicted. Visit the stashtea website for lots of tea related bits and baubles.  These make perfect hostess gifts over the holidays along with a plate of cookies.

review/text: This is my very favorite tea of all. I drink it year-round and never get tired of it like I do of others. It's good any time of the day. Not too strong, but still nicely flavorful, with a good balance of minty/spicy/herbal-y.

review/summary: Makes everything better
review/text: Christmas Eve tea (which does not actually contain tea) is not just for Christmas Eve. (Although if you are frazzled, it does releave the stress.) Christmas Eve is good any time. I do not know anyone who doesn't like it, and have often given it as gifts. It is especially nice in the winter when mint teas are a little too brisk and do not produce the same level of cozy comfort as Christmas Eve which is a soothing combination of spices and mint. It is almost as comforting as a cup of warm milk, but without the calories.

review/text: Riba foods based in Houston, Texas makes this awesome black bean dip. It is pretty much all natural and without the lard that regular refried bean dip has in it. I am not sure why in Dallas TX it's so hard to find - maybe because Riba has SO Many good flavors??? I make the traditional 7-layer dip with this instead of the refried beans, and am thinking about creating a breakfast quesadilla with this and some verde sauce. Try it, it's not too too spicy but is very good!

review/summary: Crumbled cookies are no fun to eat
review/text: The Good:<br /><br />Walker shortbread cookies are my favorite, I love them.  I bought the highlanders and each set of cookies came individually wrapped with two cookies each.  If this were the end of it, a five star review.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon shipped them in a box that was about the same size as the container they came in from the Walkers cookie company.  After UPS was through with the shipment, my cookies were reduced to crumbs.  I contacted Amazon about this problem without ever receiving a response.  Since I bought these "Shipped and Sold by Amazon", I won't be purchasing these cookies from Amazon again.

Having enjoyed these Highlanders in the past, it was both a disappointment and a big waste of money.

review/summary: Worth the cost due to the unique flavor - my favorite sugar!
review/text: Yes, these cubes are expensive; in fact, I almost gave them four stars for the expense.  Regardless, these sugar cubes are my favorite sugar product.  I've tried every brown sugar and cane sugar product you can find on Amazon and in your grocery store, and none of them compare to the rich, sweet, unique flavor of the brown sugar cubes by La Perruche.  Because I've tried so many brown sugar products, I believe the difference is the terroir, or the ground/land, where this sugar is grown.  La Perruche sugar cubes are made from African grown sugar; more specifically, sugar grown in Swaziland and/or the Congo.  Also, the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes.  I don't know from a scientific perspective how this is accomplished, but the cubes are not regularly sized, but are large and irregularly shaped, and heavier/sturdier than "cut" cubes by other producers.<br /><br />The flavor is a rich, distinct and more molasses-y flavor than other brown sugar cubes, and is somewhat darker as well.  I wish I could describe the flavor better, but it has been several months since I was able to find a somewhat affordable supply.  BTW, now that this product is being sold with free shipping via Amazon Prime, I just purchased several boxes - it is a much better deal as of the date of this review than it was a few months ago.  Recommended!

review/summary: THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT THAT I RECEIVED. THE ACTUAL PRODUCT MAY CARRY HEALTH RISKS FOR SOME COMSUMERS..
review/text: I purchased this product because of its name, "Rumford NATURALS Corn Starch" (the word "Naturals" appears large and clear on the pictured product label). Also, the Amazon description said it was made from "Non-Genetically Modified Corn". The label on the product that I ACTUALLY received does NOT say Rumford NATURALS, but it is still MADE WITH Non-Genetically Modified Corn. I say "made with" because this product now contains more than ONE ingredient. Its ingredients are: Cornstarch, Calcium Sulfate*, and ONE of the suggested servings (1 Tblsp) contains 15% of the "Daily Value" of CALCIUM. That makes this product potentially a good source for dietary calcium supplementation. ON THE OTHER HAND, for persons who must restrict their calcium intake (example, some persons with kidney stones), it can pose a potential problem, even danger. Amazon provides themselves with a nice "out" for this. They list the following: Legal Disclaimer: "Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product." BUT, IT IS NOT FAIR FOR AMAZON TO NOT AT LEAST LIST THE CORRECT INGREDIENTS AND PHOTO OF THE PACKAGE SO THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ORDER THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO "READ LABELS" AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED.<br /><br />I WILL NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN:<br /> * because I don't need extra calcium<br /> * because I don't believe that the Calcium Sulfate was added out of interest in the consumer's health<br />  but to make the product cheaper to produce so it can be priced competitively with other brands<br />  and still be touted as having been made from/with Non-Genetically Modified Corn<br /> and just on principal because I can't afford to throw it away and did not want the hassle of returning it.<br /><br />I am very, very displeased with Amazon's incorrect listing of the product, which was brought to their attention when I purchased it in February 2012, and so far nothing has been done.<br /><br />*Although Calcium Sulfate is considered a safe food additive it is basically the same thing as Plaster of Paris. AND, if you use too much of this product (basically the same amount as I had previous used of pure CORN STARCH), the very stiff sediment in the bottom of the cooking container (I make pudding in Pyrex in a microwave and usually stir it only every 30 seconds) will remind you of damp plaster!

review/summary: Great Ingredients
review/text: Nature's Recipe is now a division of that mega company Del Monte Foods.<br /><br />The Test<br /><br />The neat thing about this food is that it really does look like the photograph on the bag. It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.<br /><br />I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.<br /><br />The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue, I say you can't go wrong with Farm Selects.

review/summary: an excellent alternative to regular Gatorade
review/text: Gatorade G2 is the way to go when you want the benefits of Gatorade without quite so much sugar. As I am in a "pre-diabetes" state these days, I am drinking this type of Gatorade instead of the regular Gatorade which has noticeably more sugar in it. The really good thing is that this still replenishes carbs and electrolytes after I exercise without putting unnecessary extra sugar into my system.<br /><br />G2 comes in flavors including fruit punch and grape.<br /><br />If you're on the go, the advantage of these bottles of Gatorade is this: because the bottles are smaller you can carry them with you much easier than if you took the regular, larger size bottles of Gatorade G2.<br /><br />I highly recommend this drink if you need extra carbs or electrolytes after exercising; it replenishes them very well without the extra sugar found in regular Gatorade.

Well, since I'm never one to turn down tea, I chose to dispose of it by, well, drinking it.<br /><br />This isn't a bad tea, first off. I don't have too much experience with oolongs, but I do like the flavor of this. However, I don't taste too much of the mandarin. It almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea, and it has a similar light green/yellow color. I drink it with a little honey.<br /><br />All in all, it's a decent tea. I don't think I'll order it again, but I'll certainly finish off this tin.

review/text: Mine came with stickers to sell them for $1.59 but they cost more like $1.25 so if for retail that is not much of a mark up. I bought these for myself so that doesn't really matter and they are cheap. Similar to Lay's but cheaper. Unlike other knockoffs these seemed to taste fresher and the convenient size minimizes stale chips. Great product. Great price.

review/summary: Zesty and Spiced
review/text: I'm not a potato chip addict, but sometimes like them as a snack.<br /><br />I chose these because I'd never tried them before.<br /><br />They are delicious, zesty, slightly sweet and spicy.It's like a combination of sweet and tart at once. The oils in these chips are better for health. It is hard to put the bag down.<br /><br />They are made in Detroit Michigan and contain no trans fats, that's good enough for me. Try them.

review/text: These chips are really good. They taste better than other name brands. They're cheaper too!!  They aren't too salty like other brands. The flavors blend really well. Just the right amount of sour cream and onion flavor with a little salt mixed in. Once I start eating them, it's hard to stop!! LOL<br /><br />I will definitely be buying these potato chips rather than another name brand. Not sure if I can state the name brand or not. :)

Not sure if they have reduced the seasoning, in their processing? But out of case we bought, we have opened and thrown away 3 bags already, VERY disappointed with this order!

review/summary: These sure don't taste like ketchup to me!
review/text: I have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since I was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in Canada. This is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available. I recently got back from a trip to Montreal, where I ate at least a pack a day. I decided I really wanted some around and was happy when I found these on Amazon. Unfortunately, the flavor is nowhere close to the brands I've tried before. There's a sort of smoky, barbeque sauce thing going on. Not that they're as good as BBQ potato chips (which I love), they just don't taste like ketchup. I tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me, then just threw them all out. Yuck!

review/text: After reading all the good reviews on these chips I have to admit I was disappointed. Perhaps I just ended up with a bad batch, but I could barely taste the vinegar and there seemed to be far too many burnt (and I mean BLACK) chips in these bags. Hopefully the other flavors are better, but I'm going to stick with other brands from now on.

review/summary: Not quite Old Dutch but much better than Herr's
review/text: I LOVE Old Dutch Ketchup chips but they are no where to be found in the US and pricey on eBay.  I tried Herr's but they were dull - very ketchupy but not the tangy-vinigary ketchup bite that Old Dutch has (makes your mouth hurt  in a good way if you eat too many!).  Uncle Rays are decent - more of a kick - many "loaded" chips which I like, still, not the addictive bite I love.  So - if you love Herr's these may be too much for you.  If you love Old Dutch give these a shot.  I am still on my quest for something equal to Old Dutch!!

review/summary: Tasty Chips
review/text: I confess, I was originally looking at a different "name" brand, but they were out of the salt and vinegar, which is the only flavor I eat.  I had never even heard of Uncle Ray's, let alone tried them, but the price was reasonable and it helped me qualify for free super saver shipping.  I am happy to say I was very pleasantly surprised with these chips.  Somehow or another, even though they just seem to be in a normal box, when I opened that first bag I had a nice mix of big chips and little chips.  The salt and vinegar blend well, so much so that the flavors sometimes sneak up on you-- it sometimes seems that with the first crunch you taste salt and the second crunch gives the vinegar.  In any case, they're terrific.  I was a little reluctant about buying a somewhat large quantity of an unknown product, but I'm very glad I took the chance.

review/text: The Uncle Ray's BBQ Potato Chips are comparable to Lays or most commonly available chips in local markets.  The BBQ spice ia a bit too much; the one pound bags consisted of about half broken chips.  I won't think about buying these again, even with the discounted price and will pay a bit more for a much better kettle fried potato chip.

review/text: Bought Uncle Ray's Wavy's 16 oz potato chips because purchased  Uncle Ray's 16 oz barbque potato chips in the past and was very pleased. Oh how wrong we were.  Do not purchase the Wavy's chips!!!!!!!!!!  They are the quality of buying a no name bag of chips from a roadside service station store; broken, brown, very poor quality.  Very, very disappointed.  DO NOT.......DO NOT......DO NOT purchase Uncle Ray's 16 oz Wavy potato chips<br /><br />OCTOBER 03, 2012<br /><br />Bought Uncle Ray's sour cream and onion flavored chips for the 5th shipment with extreme disappointment. The other (4) four shipments were very good which is why we continued to buy this flavor.<br /><br />The additive that when you like an item and start to buy a lot, it will change for the worse is proving to be true for us.  This shipment of chips are awful.  Bags are extremely deflated, so was expecting to be stale; however, was not so - cannot not explain the semi-flat bags.  Chips seem to be the bottom of the barrel flakes.  You know when you try to salt your food and the top comes off, the seasoning on these chips is like that.  It appears that the top came off a full bottle or these are the bottom of the barrel crumbled chips where the seasoning has covered the chips too, too much. .  We just opened (3)three bags just now because the first bags was awful, opened second bag - awful, opened 3rd bag - also was awful.  LEFT WITH 6 MORE ,PROBABLY NOT EDIBLE, BAGS. THE CHIPS REALLY APPEAR TO BE THE NOT SO FRESH, BURNED/BOTTOM OF THE BARREL, GET RID OF LEFTOVERS.  VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTED.  WILL NOT BUY AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: Good brand of food
review/text: I have now tried both the Ocean Fish and Tuna and the Duck and Chicken variety of this food.  My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.  (In case you are wondering, it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea/1.5 pea size potato? bits per 1/4 to 1/2 can.)

review/summary: Quality white tea with added unusual flavors
review/text: Just in case, if anyone doesn't know what WHITE tea is, as opposed to green or black, let's quote Wikipedia: "white tea is fast-dried, while green tea is roasted in an oven or pan (while kept moving for even curing). Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing." What does it mean? For me, it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day. Objectively and scientifically speaking, white tea is said to have more anti-oxidants and less caffeine so, in my view, it's overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties.<br /><br />This particular product, while it comes in tea bags, it's not exactly your 'supermarket' variety. Unlike the cheap teas, black, green, herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags, the 'Choice' brand is delivered in pyramid shaped, biodegradable, nylon-like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves, not some indistinct crushed powder.<br /><br />This being a white tea, 'delicate' and 'subtle' and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case. I found the added flowers to be a little too strong, bordering to overpowering for my taste. The Lychee and Osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste - think of sweet, green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma. If it's not 'love at the first sip', give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors. Or not.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />- organic, fair trade certified White Tea<br />- natural Lychee flavor<br />- organic Osmanthus flavor<br />- contains caffeine<br /><br />The somewhat off-balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer. Time will tell but at this time 3 stars (meaning 'it's Okay') seem to be the fair rating.

review/summary: Smells like Heaven...
review/text: As soon as I opened the teabag envelope, the smell was truly Divine Nasal Candy :-).  As good as the bag and the lingering scent on the envelope smelled, the tea proved to be rather bitter.  I may have steeped it too long, so will see if the bitterness abates steeping less.  However, as I prefer milk or cream products in flower teas, the bitterness was soon dispelled with a little soy creamer and an enjoyable cup was had.  Lychee is truly a wonderful flavor for tea.  I suspect the flowers added to this lychee tea may contribute to the bitterness in the straight tea.  Will definitely reorder.

review/summary: My cats love it
review/text: My cats (7 of them) love this food so I was glad to see Amazon is carrying it again. The local stores do not carry a 15 lb bag, only the 3.5lbs and 12 lbs. This food is sealed very well, and is fresh. I have tried expensive brands and really cheapo brands of cat food, and so far 9 lives agrees very well with my cats. This food does not "rifle" through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors (like cheapo cat food) and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy. My cats ages range from 3 years to 18 years old, and believe me, this 9 Lives brand and flavor are something they all like. The price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free.<br /><br />I also buy the Iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love. Again, no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now.<br /><br />If you do try this, or switch your cat(s) over, be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust. In the end, I think you will be very pleased with the quality and price.<br /><br />Also, we used to take in foster cats, and fed them this 9 Lives brand, and they all did very well.

The kittens love the food and always look forward to eating it.  Shipped right to your door.  Can't go wrong with that!

review/summary: 9 Lives Daily Essentials 15 pound bag cat food. Good food, good price.
review/text: I purchase 2 15 pound bags of 9 Lives Daily Essentials a month for my daughter's cats. They love it. She says they often gather around the carton and wait for her to open it. They know what's in there and can't wait for it to be opened. If the cats love it, we love it. Isn't that how it goes?

review/summary: Low quality ingredients, but...
review/text: As the ingredients contained in this food are not the optimal food sources essential to a cat's well being, I don't actually feed my cats this dry food.<br /><br />Corn is the first ingredient, which is a food my cats really don't crave.  There is a meat source as the second ingredient, but unfortunately, it is a by-product.  Although there are a couple of other meat sources listed in the ingredients, the addition of artificial preservatives and coloring make this cat food a less than desirable food staple for any cat.<br /><br />However, the Amazon price is good and with Amazon prime 2-day free shipping directly to work, this is a very convenient food for the shop cats I feed.  While the ingredients aren't the best, feeding it along with canned food, it is a balanced diet and seems to keep the shop cats healthy.

review/summary: Cats love it
review/text: I have 6 feral cats that I trapped, neutered/spayed and released.  They still hang around our property so of course we feed them.  They really like 9 lives and I believe it is good for them.  Being old and my husband handicapped, it is so easy for us to have it delivered right to our door step instead of wrestling with the bags at the store and unloading when we get home.  I am very satisfied with the product and Amazon.  The subscribe and save option is even better as I don't have to remember to order it.

review/summary: Cats Love this food.
review/text: My two cats love this cat food more than the kirkland signature brand.  It's also very cheap and affordable cat food at walmart. I would recommend this cat food over meow mix or friskies any day.  Get 9lives dry cat food.  It's one of the better brands out there.
