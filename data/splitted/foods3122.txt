review/summary: Good assortment, not as many "Retro" candies as you would expect
review/text: I purchased this for my husband as he'd always talked about the candies he used to eat as a child (his parents owned a candy store at one point). While there was a fair quantity of candy, much of it was stuff that's still available today. We were expecting more "Wow, haven't seen this is 30 years!" candies and fewer "Oh, I had one of these yesterday" choices.

review/text: Purchased this for a friend who often talked about the candy he grew up eating. Most of the contents are "penny candy" still available today. The packaging was cute, but for half the price I could have put together my own simmilar assortment.

review/summary: Retro Candy baskets make a unique gift for any occasion...one sure to bring back the memories
review/text: Have you ever been walking and heard a song on the radio and remembered something you thought long forgotten? Have you ever smelled something cooking that reminded you of growing up? Have you ever seen something that is so symbolic that you are transported back in mind? Our five senses are the strongest triggers of memory that we as humans possess, and this Retro Candy basket from the 1970's takes full advantage of that to make a perfect gift for the person who has every gadget, trinket, and item they ever needed.<br /><br />Growing up in the 1970s (warning retro alert) I can remember going to the candy store and picking up some of the items in this basket. Laffy taffy, SO good, bubble gum cigs(probably not the best choice since I later smoked) Lemon and Cherry heads, and of course my personal favorite, Razzles! This basket has it all, and just reading the candy names sent me into a fit of nostalgia. Pixy Stix, Wonka Tart N Tiny, Sweetarts, Laffy Taffy, Bubble Gum Cigs, Candy Cigs, Apple Heads, Cherry Heads, Lemon Heads Small, Charms Sweet & Sour Pops, Sugar Daddy Pops, Atomic Fireballs, Boston Baked Beans, Tootsie Roll Midgees, Licorice Pipe, Necco Assorted Wafers, Bubble Gum Cigars, Wonka Runts, Fun Gum Wax Lips, Pop Rocks, Zotz, Reed's Root Beer Candy Rolls, Classic Now & Laters, Lemon Heads Large, Smile Pops, Jaw Breakers and Razzles Candy Gum. Everything the kid in you still desires, but never had enough dimes and nickles for.<br /><br />Be warned however, this cool box contains enough sugar to make a rhino hyper, and you run the risk of arousing your co-workers jealousy when you walk in the office with your Neccos and your Razzles. If you buy this for someone else, you will be highly tempted to devour the entire basket, and have to reorder more. There are several other sets in this product line, each with their own unique line-up, but for me, this is the one. What price do you put on memories? For this little trip down memory lane its $26.99, and the enjoyment is worth every penny. Now excuse me while I put in another order...<br /><br />A.G. Corwin<br />St.Louis, MO

review/summary: Can we say stale
review/text: Wow  thought this would be a Fun mix of candy. Boy was i wrong  90% stale. Makes me think i read the description wrong. Is this candy from the 70's  literally. They took the smallest versions of whatever they could find and put it in here. like 1-2 of all the candies. But the candies you can find easily they threw a few more in their. I think the box weighed more than what you get. Being here in Afghanistan i cant just go out and buy candy when i want so i try to get mixes. Found this and was very dissapointed.

review/text: My brother and I grew up during the 70's, and I thought it would be fun to send this to him for a housewarming gift  I didn't get a chance to see the item myself (he lives in another state), but here's what he said in his thank you email:  "It really cracked me up and was delicious. They really nailed it with the retro contents, right down to the fake cigs with the pink tips. The wax lips really brought back memories, especially when inserted. It was the first package received at the new address and I was like "what the heck is this?", and then started laughing upon opening. Good call."

review/text: I got this set for a single-digit price from Warehouse Deals and, trust me, if you get it on sale, the candy selection will make you MORE than happy.  I still question that Dulce de Leche Dum Dums were available in the 1970s, and I think Dip'n Stix were a 90s thing, but there are some other classics in here like Sugar Babies, Freshen Up gum, Pop Rocks, Laffy Taffy, and Necco Wafers.  It's definitely a decent collection of retro sweets.

review/text: I bought this for my sister's 45th birthday. She liked the idea, but her daughter ended up eating most of the candy.  Some nostalgic items but some things are still available easily today.  Shipping costs are quite high and "compensate" for the reasonable price of the box.  I probably wouldn't order this again, but it is a good (albeit expensive) gag gift.

It is customary for most gifts to be a surprise to the recipient.  Nevertheless, there is a permanent gold lable that specifically identifies the contents.  Some surprise. Inappropriate and dumb. I will have to tape a card over this to preserve the surprise.

review/summary: Buy this somewhere else. Not from anneeavon!!!
review/text: This tea is an excellent herbal tea. Love the taste and it's not as weak as most herbal tea is. I used to get it from the Commissary on base but they stopped stocking it so I checked on Amazon. Most wanted to sell by the case but anneeavon sold them in single packages and I swear it said "and free shipping when ordered from this seller" above the "add to cart" button. I ordered last night and opened my e-mail this afternoon to find they charged me $8.49 shipping for each of the 3 boxes I ordered! And the estimated arrival time is a week away! For that kind of money I'd expect overnight. For that kind of money I could have gotten a couple cases and had change. It's probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products.

review/summary: Similac is a good brand
review/text: Similac is a good brand of formula.  My daughter started out on the ready to feed, we tried to switch her to the concentrate, but she was not interested.  So we would mix half ready to feed & half concentrate, then she was ok with it.  But she still does not like the concentrate alone.  My boys drank it fine, but all babies are different. I think it is a good product.  I like it better than powder.  Powder always seemed to watery to me.  My boys never got filled up on powder, but they did on concentrate.  Or the powder did not get mixed up good, & they had lumps, not good.  Concentrate is easy to mix up & seems to agree with my babies.

HIghly recommended, though the cost is quite high.

Everything in my cupboard had MSG in it. This does not. The risk is always, "Will it taste good?". MSG adds a lot of salt and what the brain reads as flavor and sometimes removing it can seem like a reduction in flavor. Not so with this product!! It is so good - I use it wherever and whenever I can. I am finding that I do not have to use very much so it goes quite far. I now have the chicken, beef and onion flavored versions and they are all good. MMMMMMM...happy tummy!

review/text: The jar of curd arrived with the paper seal torn (not just torn, 1/2 inch missing - see photo above), the jar was sticky and there were sticky fingerprints on the lid. When I opened it there was no suction from a seal. It's obvious to me that this jar had been opened, used, then returned and re-sold to me; either that, or someone in shipping had a bad case of the munchies. Since it would cost me more in time and gas to return it for a refund, I'm writing this review. I'll buy the lemon curd the next time I'm in a town with a Trader Joe's. At the time of purchase the seller was Delanotradingcompany and fulfilled by Amazon. ***An Update: a few days after writing this review, I got an email from Amazon apologizing for the problem. Since the jar of curd didn't come from Amazon, they couldn't replace it, but they refunded my money. Very impressive customer service, Amazon, thank you. Since the curd itself is a good product, I'm raising my rating from one star to 3.

It's not too sweet and not too tart.  It's just right.  The best part for me is that this product did not trigger my migraine headaches like so many other products because of artificial flavoring and coloring.  Barry Farm uses natural ingredients.  It is simply delicious.  I highly recommend this product to all apple jelly lovers.

review/text: I've had some trouble finding apple jelly as of late. I was encouraged when I found this on Amazon as all my other food purchases on here have been great. I thought it was pretty expensive as jelly goes but decided to order anyway, big mistake. The jelly was separated into a lot of liquid(very sweet) and a little jelly(very bland), needless to say I am still looking for apple jelly.

review/text: I've had so much trouble finding apple jelly for  sauce recipes ( in this case a spiced ham sauce) that I was delighted to find one here on Amazon! Unfortunately, the flavor was pretty soft and bland.....not particularly "apple" flavored, and it was also runny....... which is odd for apple, which is very high in pectin! I'll have to keep looking.

review/text: The peppers came quickly and were very well packaged.  Did not feel as if I got taken on the shipping charges.  The peppers are great!  I didn't give 5 stars because I didn't feel as if the peppers were as hot as they should be.  I used to get them from my Dad in New Mexico and his were hot with a capital H.  So, I don't know where these were grown but that may have something to do with it.  I will buy them again as my Dad is deceased and that option is no longer open.

review/text: WHO?<br />I am a 54 year old gal with 4 other adults and 3 children in my household.<br /><br />WHAT?<br />I bought a case of strawberry unfrosted poptarts.<br /><br />WHY?<br />These are my husband's favorite poptart - nice for a fast breakfast or a quick sweet fix. Great with a glass of cold milk or a hot cup of coffee.  I thought these would last for months.<br /><br />REVIEW:<br />1 - PACKAGING: Poptarts are 2/pack and 4 packs/box. The individual packs are a silver plastic-like material but there is no labeling; if you mix packs of different flavors there is no way to identify the flavors.<br />2 - PRODUCT: Poptarts are like thin biscuits with a sweet filling.  Some have frosting that makes them extra sweet.  They can be eaten hot from the toaster or right out of the package.  They are not good for purse snacks as they can be broken or squashed easily.<br />3 - PRICE: I forget the exact price, but with free shipping and a discount for siging up to automatic delivery, it beat the grocery store by far!<br />4 - SHIPPING: This order arived in 3-4 days, which was faster than I expected.<br /><br />ORDER AGAIN?<br />Yes - without a doubt.

There is no longer a consistency or the quality of taste that Lyons has provided in the past. We are greatly disappointed and are at a loss as to keep trying new boxes or search for an alternate tea. Obviously something has changed in the processing and production of this tea and it is not for the better. We miss our great-tasting, deeply aromatic tea.

review/summary: A bit different, and wonderful
review/text: These peppercorns are a beautiful rosy color, which clues you in before you even get a chance to open the package that they're not the peppercorns you've known all your life. When you do pull open the bag and inhale their aroma, you'll find they combine the scent of pepper with a wonderful fruity, almost floral overtone. It's hard to describe, and even harder to imagine until you've experienced it. The lovely part is that the flavor profile doesn't diminish in use; when I ground and steeped these Sichuan peppercorns for a dark chocolate mousse (grind finely, and steep in the heavy cream for 30 minutes before straining the cream into the chocolate) their vibrant peppery fruit/floral scent was the top note of the mousse. It was a memorably different flavor. Now I'm looking for ways to add them to more dishes, to see what new nuances they can impart to old favorites.

review/text: JR Mushrooms earned my undying devotion when they noticed I had clicked the order button twice and ordered two pounds of peppercorns.  Just as I was realizing this, they emailed to ask if I REALLY wanted two pounds.  Great Work!  The peppercorns came quickly and are fresh and fragrant--and a lifetime supply.  Since then, I ordered vanilla bean pods too.  Also, good value and quickly delivered.

review/text: Sichuan peppercorns are magical. If you've been to a good Sichuan restaurant you'll hopefully have at least one dish that has the great flavor of Sichuan peppercorns along with the strange and wonderful tongue numbing sensation. If you're interested in making great Sichuan style Chinese food at home, this is a must have ingredient. They come well packaged, and it's enough to last for along time.

review/summary: GREAT Product!
review/text: I ordered an 8 oz. package of peppercorns...wow, just wow...that is a LOT of peppercorns. Unless you expect to use these a lot, think about a smaller package! I may be using these in the nursing home.<br /><br />My package arrived quickly, and was well packed. Looking at a previous review that insisted the package was lightweight, I weighed my bag of peppercorns upon arrival and it was exactly 8 oz. So I wouldn't be too concerned about a lightweight package.<br /><br />These peppercorns are beautiful, with a lively flavor and plump appearance. They are not shriveled like many peppercorns. I used them to make Kung Pao chicken and ZING they about burned my face off! But in a good way. Such peppery, fresh, citrusy hot flavor. Love them!!!<br /><br />If I ever run out (ever)...I will reorder from this seller!

review/summary: Good Peppers!
review/text: Peppers arrived in good shape, sourced from Olive Nation - checked the weight before opening because of other reviewer's concern and it was dead on at 8oz net, and the aroma/taste were very good.  There are a few black centers still but it's much better quality than the local Asian grocery at roughly the same price.  As someone else noted 8oz. is a LOT of pepper -- it may take a while to use all this up.

review/text: This is yummy and only needs to be heated, on the stove or in the microwave.  I like to add frozen peas. but canned peas seem to add a sweetness that doesn't work with the savory meal.  The chicken meat is ample, in big chunks so you know you aren't getting the stuff scraped off the bones after the rest of the meat has been sold for higher prices. The dumplings are really good.  It is quite "saucey" so you'll want a bowl instead of a plate.  Just the thing when I need comfort food but don't have the will to cook.

review/text: Bilberry taste a lot like the berry of similar spelling. To put it straightly it tastes a lot like a slightly tart blueberry. They may be a simplistic view of this tea, but I think that is a universal flavor identification that everyone can agree with. I like tea, and this one is not bad. It is definitely different and I might say worth trying out to see if you like it. Bilberrys are of course high in anthocyanins which is the same powerful antioxidant behind recent health fads as the acai berry and black raspberry.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Healthy<br />+Unique taste<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Unique taste<br /><br />Overall three stars. Remember that three stars means it just okay, I am not hammering this product as I am sure some people will very much so enjoy it. If you are taking it for health purposes than I am sure you won't mind the taste at all as it is great tasting for medicine.

review/text: I got these on sale with high hopes of it tasting like a Toggi bar. Or even a kitkat bar. These taste like the wafers you can find at any grocery store (choco, vanilla, strawberry), dipped in chocolate substitute. They are also an odd shape. You either shove 1 end of it in your mouth like a rectangle hotdog or take a normal bite and crumbs go everywhere..Every time I open the cabinet for a snack, there they are waiting to be eaten. The thought of the taste drives me away from the cabinet. So I guess they are good for dieting.

review/summary: a little bit disappointing
review/text: I've ordered beef jerky online several times over the last few years. It's usually overpriced at the store, especially when it comes in 1 to 2 oz. packets. Yes it takes a lot of beef to make beef jerky, but I suspect some of the big players in the industry are making a lot of money.<br /><br />So I try to keep my eye on the smaller outfits which will sell excellent quality jerky for $20 or less per pound. I think my favorite to date has been Tillamook Country Smoker, especially their hot varieties, though jerkyusa is quite good too. I've got a background in jerky which extends beyond what you'll find in the typical grocery or discount store, though I have eaten my share of those brands too.<br /><br />The price on the Golden Valley's Peppered Beef Jerky is excellent, so I figured that I'd give it a shot. I'd say that the two qualities that beef jerky should have are:<br /><br />1)texture (esp. chewability)<br /><br />2)flavor<br /><br />Regarding the texture of this jerky -- this particular batch was not great. Some pieces were better than others, but on average, it was pretty tough. I'd say it's a bit better than the megabrand that you'll find in most grocery stores, but I was expecting a little bit more.<br /><br />The flavor was OK, but nothing special. Overall, I prefer my peppered jerky to have more of a black pepper bite to it - this was definitely on the less seasoned end of the spectrum. In addition, the jerky had a relatively sweet flavor to it that I don't particularly like.<br /><br />I found this particular batch to be relatively average in both texture and flavor. I've decided to give it 3 stars because the price is very reasonable.

review/summary: Not So Good
review/text: This jerky sounded pretty promising.<br /><br />It has a great price, and they use quality beef and no chemicals.<br /><br />When I got it, however, I was very underwhelmed by the flavor.  It was too sweet, and not spicy enough.  Also, when I got done chewing on a bunch of it, I would have a wad of unchewable fatty junk in my mouth which I had to spit out.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-They use quality beef with no growth hormones or antibiotics<br /><br />-None of the chemicals that are in a lot of jerky<br /><br />-Texture was good, but not great<br /><br />-Good price<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Not very spicy<br /><br />-Sugar is the second ingredient, making it way too sweet and not as healthy as it could be.<br /><br />-Beef cuts a little too fatty.<br /><br />I would definitely not buy this flavor again, and I would probably keep looking before considering another bag of Golden Valley Jerky.

review/text: I'm a big fan of almost any mammal jerky, and also of not going to the store.  I ordered this based on the description and it arrived very quickly.  The Good:  It's excellent quality and well packaged.  The Bad:  For me, it was seriously lacking in flavor, and I'd say nearly tasteless.  It had a slightly sweet flavor, but very little salt, brine, or much else in the way of seasonings.  Conclusion:  It's high quality and a decent value.  I'll try a different flavor based on this, but I will not order this flavor again.

review/summary: started well, ended poorly
review/text: I'm not a jerky connoisseur (and can't afford to be). I think the Golden Valley peppered beef jerky strikes a good balance of quality and value. The product looks, smells, and tastes pretty much like beef with some black pepper added to it. No MSG, no artificial flavors. Hours after you've eaten it, you won't feel like something is polluting you. The package has only a small amount of crumbs and small fragments, so it's finger food all the way to the bottom of the bag, not fingers-in-your-mouth food.<br />UPDATE: After a long period of subscribing to the Golden Valley Original 16-ounce packages, I've given up. The quality declined gradually, with pieces becoming smaller and tougher with not much flavor. But the final blow was a sudden decrease to a 12-ounce package -- at the same price. I'll have to find something else.
