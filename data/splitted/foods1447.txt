review/text: I ordered this cereal based on the good reviews here and else where on the web. I also have tried and love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ56E4">Envirokidz Organic Leapin' Lemurs Peanut Butter & Chocolate Cereal, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. Unfortunately the frosted flakes taste nothing like it's standard counterpart. The flakes are hard, but not crisp. They are also very lightly sweetened.<br /><br />This is the one environkids cereal that I couldn't find locally, and now I see why. Overall I feel like this was a waste of money.

review/summary: Very lightly sugared
review/text: Just enough sugar and alot less than any other regular frosted flakes I used to eat before being diagnosed celiac. Product stays crisp in the box withouth resealing. And stays crisp in a bowl of milk. It is not often that a gluten free product exactly mimics the mainstream item but this one certainly does. Tip: The manufacturer makes the same product for adults but it costs more! So get this one, the Kidz version!

review/summary: Excellent healthy delicious organic soup base! Great for kids!
review/text: A friend told me about this product. She is very health-conscious when it comes to food for her kids. One of her kids has allergy, so she has also been looking for good gluten free food products. She first found this line of soup base in a high-end food store in the East Coast and tried it out. Her whole family loved (and still loves) it. She sent me one as gift a few months ago and we tried it out and my kids love it too. We used to boil meat and vegetable or 2-3 hours and used the soup to cook food for the kids. This was very time and energy consuming. We tried other soup bases in the past but the kids complained about being very thirsty after drinking those. This one is great. It saves us a lot of work and the kids still get healthy delicious soup! I recently found it on Amazon & bought 5 different flavors. The order arrived within 2 days with my Amazon Prime membership and we now can enjoy the different flavors.

review/text: i am a converted veggo and used to LOVE steak. (stopped eating meat because of the treatment of our animals and the fact that any meat that is NOT organic is basically a toss between fatal and toxic)<br />doesnt taste like beef whatsoever. something good to compare it to or to say that its similar to would be chicken ramen noodle seasoning. Almost exactly the same taste.... not quite as potent since it has a much lower sodium content. If i were this product's company, I'd rename it chicken base. also, it's yellow..? the same exact color as ramen noodle seasoning-chicken. at east make it brown if you're going to claim it tastes like beef.<br />it is tasty but the advertising is a bit misleading.

review/summary: Use it everyday!
review/text: First of all, this stuff gives you energy, without the "cracked out" feeling other energy products give you. I drink it everyday to get me going. I've never been an energetic person, and I find it hard to get going every day. I also have a weak stomach so coffee and Red Bull(& the likes) are out of the question. I stumbled upon 5 hr energy at a gas station, but was taken aback at the price (around $2.50/bottle) but decided to give it a try...I know this may sound silly, but this stuff really has changed my life.<br /><br />I now have the energy that I need to get through the day. I describe it to others like this: after you take it, you don't even feel any different until you realize "hey, I'm not tired anymore." That's whats great about it. You don't get those shakes and other negative effects that some other energy drinks give you. It just gives you enough energy to wake you up, and get you motivated.<br /><br />****If you've never taken it before, just try drinking half of the bottle first, and see how you feel. It won't hurt you if you take the whole thing, but there's no sense in wasting the other half if you don't even need it!******

review/summary: Didn't last 6 minutes
review/text: I purchased this product as an alternative to a rawhide. Our 5 month old German Shorthair Pointer puppy ate it in a matter of 6 minutes or less. She loved it, but it was more of an expensive treat.<br /><br />With a puppy, I needed something to satisfy her chewing urge. The treat fractured into small bits all over the floor but our dog was willing to pick those up. The pieces looked rather sharp and that was a concern. Others mentioned it was made in China and I would like to add the first ingredient is corn.  It might last longer for very small dogs.

review/summary: Safer than rawhide, don't last as long but also cleans teeth
review/text: I picked these up from my local pet shop for a bit cheaper than what they are on offer for from Amazon, so you might wish to shop around.<br /><br />Over all I am quite satisfied with these "bones." They are much safer than raw hide chews given they are made from dried chicken, which means unlike raw hide you know these are actually digestible. This is the biggest reason I bought them. My vet recommended not giving my Sheltie raw hide as they aren't properly digestible. Whether this is true or not, I've heeded her advice.<br /><br />Baird, my Sheltie, really seems to enjoy them. When he sees one coming out of the bag, his tail is wagging like crazy. He enjoys these as much as our old family Sheltie McGyver enjoyed raw hide. The only difference I see between these and raw hide is that raw hide lasted roughly 30 minutes longer in chew time than these. I'd say Baird can chew through one of these in about 30 or so minutes, while our old Sheltie could chew on a single raw hide for an hour, at which point we would throw away the little nub. There is nothing left of these bones after 30 minutes.<br /><br />As far as the dental application goes, it does smell of mint, so I assume it should, if nothing else, help with doggy breath, though to be fair Baird has never really had "doggy breath." I also use some dog mouth foam so I don't know what really keeps his breath "fresh" between the two.<br /><br />If you aren't too sure about raw hide for your dog and want something you know can be digested, these are definitely worth it.<br /><br />For those that try to keep track of where the things they give their dog come from, these are made in China. I've tried finding something similar not made in China, but it seems such a thing doesn't exist or I just can't find them.

I could not find the same raspberries anywhere but here. These were exactly what I was looking for! They don't taste like the freeze-dried raspberries, but are more moist. They are really easy to eat and taste amazing. The only reason why I gave this review a 4 is because of the price. I think the price is a bit steep, but my guess is because it might be difficult to dry raspberries. If the price were lower, I would literally have them on a repeat order basis. However, if you are looking to try these, definitely do so! I think you will be happy with your purchase.

review/text: I have recently started drinking hot tea again (since my childhood when Grandma made us hot tea with milk & sugar) and have been trying different types and brands of tea to find my favorites.  I can't speak the tea lover's lingo (full-bodied, smoky with hints of arsnic, etc.) but this tea is decent.  I use it mostly to make iced tea but I drink it hot occasionally too.  I have been completely spoiled on Dilmah tea & now any others seem inferior.  Lipton Yellow Label is definitely better than PG Tips! I initially bought PG Tips and could never make a cup of hot tea that did not have a bitter after taste.  I thought it was my brewing technique until I tasted better teas.  I probably won't buy more of this tea since there are so many others out there to try but I plan to use up the rest of what I bought.  If anyone wants some PG Tips let me know & I'll send it to you for the price of shipping!!

review/summary: Breaking the Fancy Feast Habit
review/text: I want to get the cats away from the the grain-filled cat foods but it's a struggle. Fancy Feast is like kitty-crack and hard to get them away from once they have it. Most of the kitty health food brands, like Newman's Own and Wellness, are completely shunned. One of my Siamese makes the burying motion over those that makes it entirely clear what she thinks those foods are. B.F.F cat food, however, makes the cut with the cats and is actually preferred by the fussiest of them over Fancy Feast.<br /><br />The B.F.F. cat foods use no grains--a good thing. They do use a few ingredients cats don't need, like potato starch (for gravy flavors) and sunflower oil. A good animal-based oil would be better, but this formula is still a huge step up from most commercial cat foods. All the recommended vitamins and minerals are included. The company's web site says the food is made in a human-grade food facility. The company's website says they use free range chicken and dolphin/turtle-safe fish.<br /><br />The smell of the cat food is quite strong and fishy. Tuna is the main ingredient in all the varieties. Every flavor has been well received and eaten enthusiastically.

review/summary: My picky cat gobbles this down!
review/text: My cat is super picky when it comes to canned food (only picky for canned food) but she LOVES the bff canned foods.  I've tried the Chicken and Tuna, Tuna and Salmon and Tuna and Pumpkin flavors (non aspic) and she likes all 3.  I've only given it to her a few times since I try to rotate it in with chicken canned food but she knows when I open the can and waits for me to put it down.  She even waits/stalks after I've given her meds which usually results in her hiding from me for at least 15 min after.  She also eats about 1/2 of the can more or less immediately and saves the rest for later.  I will say normally I try  not to give her seafood but I don't really have a choice since I need her to eat and gain weight so I'm willing to feed her this if it will help.

review/summary: Reforming junk food addict
review/text: Being told I was about one bowl of pasta away from Type II Diabetes, and that I should "eliminate" bread (my favorite food), I decided to search the web for a "cheat."<br /><br />Sprouted grain anything is touted as being lower in carbohydrates and sugar than regular OR whole wheat anything (both of which convert directly to sugar when digested).  Sprouted grain, allegedly, does not (according to an online flat belly diet plan, anyway).  So, not wanting to give up pasta, (and who wouldn't want a flatter belly?) I decided to try this.<br /><br />The box says that because it's natural, it cooks in half the time of regular pasta so, according to the directions, I cooked it for 4.5 minutes, but it was still a little stiff.  Next time I'll try for 6 and see what happens.<br />The texture is similar to wheat pasta and with sauce on it, it was hard to tell the difference - except for the color.<br /><br />I don't have blood work scheduled for another 4 months, and I haven't entirely given up on white bread, cheeseburgers and The Olive Garden, but hopefully this will help bring my triglycerides down. Oh!  And I did lose 3 pounds without trying.

review/summary: It's a healthy pasta, but you can do better
review/text: This is the healthiest line of pasta on the market, so it's got that going for it, and I think that it tastes pretty good (I like the taste of whole grains), but my main problem with it is the texture.  Personally, I don't want to call the manufacturers liars (they seem to be christians, and I have it on good authority that christians aren't supposed to lie), but I tried cooking this pasta on two separate occasions and both times it took way longer to cook it than stated on the box, and the results we got were (in my opinion) barely edible because the pasta was very tough and instantly stuck together when it was drained (this might be because I didn't boil it in enough water though).<br /><br />Overall, I'm giving this product 4 stars because it is very healthy, it tastes okay if you like whole grains, and the food for life people make fantastic products.  However, I will not be buying this pasta again because of the texture issue.  Personally, I would recommend bionaturae brand pasta because it is simply the best pasta I have ever had.  It's also cheaper than the food for life pasta, and is (at least according to the label) almost identical to the food for life brand on a nutritional front, although the food for life brand has more fiber and protein (and 30 more calories per serving).  I'd say buy this at the store if you REALLY want to try it before you buy 6 or 12 boxes of it.

review/summary: Great Natural Medicine!!!
review/text: To anyone looking for a natural remedie,this is the greatest!I have used other brands,believe me,in price and quality I find this one the best option.Wheatgrass and a healthy lifestyle is all you need to be in the best shape,of course with exercise,drinking water,etc.I have reflux disease and was taking Nexium for several months until I noticed that the wheatgrass was helping me,so I dumped the Nexium!The reflux is better,my digestion is much better and it's even helping me loose weight!That's because it makes your metabolism faster.You can use wheatgrass for any disease(there's information that even for cancer!)Of course if you're on medication Do Not drop it unless your doctor says so.Wheatgrass will not harm you.It can only do you good.I'm not completely cured of the reflux disease yet,but maybe that's because I have to put more raw food in my diet,specially alkaline foods.Wheatgrass is probably the food with the highest alkaline content available.By the way,when you mix it with water with a spoon,have some patience until it completely dissolves,mix it like maybe for 3 minutes.The most expensive brand I've<br />seen on Amazon reacts like this too and the NOW brand has a much better price and same quality,also certified organic!To me,this product regulates your body functions so it works as it should.If you grow and juice wheatgrass<br />in your home,it's more potent,but if you don't have the time,this is a great option.Take it three times a day to see faster results!To your health!!

review/text: This helped me heal a stomach ulcer and gives me more energy. The taste is sweet and delicious and I have to laugh at the reviewers who don't like the taste because they've obviously never tried wheat grass juice that was bitter. This is so much better than the wheat grass I tasted twenty years ago in my local health food store which was freshly juiced. It was horrible and made me gag. I hated it so much that I waited over twenty years to try it again. Boy am I glad I tried this now brand. It is helping my digestive and stomach problems.

review/summary: I love this stuff!
review/text: I would love to be able to grow my own wheat grass, but since that is not an option right now I opted to try the wheat grass juice powder. "Wheat grass juice powder" is much more difficult to find than simple "wheat grass powder".<br />What is the difference?<br />"Wheat grass juice powder" is made by first juicing the wheat grass and then extracting the water from the wheat grass juice which creates a more concentrated powder.<br />"Wheat grass powder" is simply freeze drying the whole (un-juiced) wheat grass plant.<br />I have found that my energy levels are much higher after drinking this wheat grass juice powder in the morning over the previous wheat grass powder I was using.<br />No, it doesn't taste the greatest (think mowed lawn), but I highly recommend it for those looking to add an extremely nutritious supplement to their diet.<br />Now Foods has the most affordable product out there (that I've found) so as long as they continue to make this product, I will keep my cupboard stocked with it.

review/summary: Nice mild flavor
review/text: These shortbread heart biscuits are very yummy with tea or coffee, and are a much healthier substitute for shortbread cookies.  They have a nice crumbly texture and good mild buttery flavor, with no aftertaste.  They are so tasty that it is very easy to eat a whole box in one sitting.  My 3 kids (ranging 19-8y.o.) and I liked them.  I like that they are heart shaped; it makes them cute to serve.  These Orgran cookies are labeled gluten-free and dairy-free and free from artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives.  This product is also free from animal derivatives.  They are low in fat and calories (and they have zero cholesterol). This was our first time trying an Orgran product.  We ordered these and the Orgran Pasta Spirals from Amazon.  We will be buying these cookies again.

review/text: I was skeptical of using a sugar free mix to make drinks, and to be sure, it's not like getting a margarita made with fresh-pressed lime juice.  But, if you drink a lot of these in the summer, give this a try. Getting rid of the guilt along with the calories makes up for the slightly bitter taste. Don't bother, though, if you have one every once in a while and enjoy the real stuff instead.

The color is insanely bright red in person, it didn't taste too much like food coloring though so that was good. It tastes better mixed with dark rum, berries and a splash of cream as a low carb daiquiri. I am glad I got it on mega sale.

review/text: I really enjoyed this product but I don't drink it according to the instructions.  I add more mix than instructed and I also add about a tablespoon of sugar alcohol when I make a batch.  It gives the drink a smoother sweetness than without it.  As for the strawberry flavoring, it taste more berry than strawberry.  A warning, when making a virgin margarita use less ice and expect a change in the quality of sweetness.  It's still good but loses some of that smooth sweet flavor and you get a little bitterness

I didn't intend on buying the strawberry flavor but they didn't have the regular flavor. It has a very bad after taste and doesn't really taste like strawberry. Maybe it would have helped if I had put in fresh strawberries. I know it wasn't the tequila (Gran Centenario Anejo Tequila) since its the same kind that I use in regular margaritas. I decided to give it 2 stars since it's the only sugar-free mix I can find. I'll try a different grocery store and hope they have the other 2 flavors and give it another shot.

I have used canned pumpkin instead of the bananas and it came out wonderfully also.  My gluten-free son eats this bread just about daily.  We make a loaf pan size and cut it into pieces so I can toast it lightly in the mornings for breakfast - really fast and no junk.  I have also made this bread with 3 egg whites, 1/2 cup applesauce, 2 bananas, 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, and 1/2 cup water to make a low-fat, high fruit version of banana bread.  It was great! My other favorite gluten-free breakfast breads are the Namaste spice cake (applesauce version) and the Pamela's corn muffin mix.

review/summary: Fabulous GF Banana Bread Mix -- Easy & Tasty!
review/text: As I'm sure my fellow gluten-free peeps know, it is difficult to use a boxed baking product without going at least 80% off box to make it taste any good. Usually I have to add spices -- gluten-free vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, syrups and so forth. Even so, the texture is usually still wrong even if I get the taste correct.<br /><br />Despite having forgotten how much effort goes into preparing an item to be baked, this impulse purchase in a local supermarket proved to be a very good decision. What a fabulous product! From the start of pouring the mix, it smelled so good. Adding the mashed bananas, water, and eggs made it smell like... well, it smelled like banana bread. Real banana bread. Oh, the anticipation!<br /><br />I was obviously very excited to see the finished product 60-70 minutes later and was not disappointed. It was perfect! This banana bread looks like banana bread, smells like banana bread, feels like banana bread and tastes like banana bread. If you didn't know it was gluten-free, you wouldn't know it was gluten-free. Apart from my own newfound love, rave reviews were received from my daughter, mother, and not gluten-free partner and father. (Those last two are a sign of true greatness in a boxed mix; given their ability to eat actual bread, they are usually only possible to please with a mix when I doctor it beyond recognition from its original state.)<br /><br />My only apologies go to my parents with whom I was a little stingy and the vegetarian friends who came over when I could have offered a slice but didn't because it's mine all mine (and my daughter's).<br /><br />The price on this mix on Simply Organic's own website is $4.99 (sometimes but rarely on sale for $3.99), more than I paid on sale at my local Shaw's. That's a better price -- but as usual the price checking win goes to Amazon, who offer a pack of three boxes for $12.90 (works out to $4.30 a box) as a one-off and at the low low price of $10.96 (works out to $3.65) with Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />I recommend serving with strawberries and heavy whipped cream, which is quite possibly the first time I've basically agreed with a serving suggestion on the box as well.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious (w/ a few modifications) !
review/text: I've been looking for a simple way to enjoy gluten-free banana bread for months and came upon Simply Organic Banana Bread mix. I made the mix according to the instructions, adding just the bananas, oil and water. It was okay, but tasted more like a dry, dense spice cake rather than banana bread. So I took half a pkg. of Gluten-Free Pantry Old Fashioned Cake and Cookie mix and half a pkg. of Simply Organic Banana Bread mix and combined together with 2 eggs, 1 tsp of vanilla, 3/4 cup of milk and half a stick of butter. I used a mixer on medium speed as I added 3 over-ripened bananas(you need 3 bananas instead of two for moisture) and pecans. I poured the mixture into an 8x8 glass pan and baked for 45 minutes. The end result was the BEST banana bread, with or without gluten, I have ever tasted!. We ate our slices with butter and cream cheese and devoured it in less than two days.

review/text: Got a bag of this as part of a sampler with 11 different flavors in 8oz bags. I opened this bag first, knowing I wouldn't like it; why not get it over with quickly, right?<br /><br />I was totally wrong. The aroma is amazing right out of the bag, especially the raspberry. So far I've ground it for drip and espresso. The drip brew was smooth and tasty, but the chocolate and raspberry don't come through very much in the flavor (I use cream and sugar) - that may be a good thing for some people. Using the espresso grind in an aeropress was AMAZING. The chocolate and raspberry came through in both scent and flavor, and with the natural sweetness of the coffee bean I didn't add any sugar at all, only cream. Will be trying it in a french press next.<br /><br />I only opened the bag two days ago... and I'm snacking on the coffee beans! I don't DO that! I think chocolate covered beans are gross. But once or twice a day I find myself opening the bag and stealing off with three or four beans.<br /><br />Is this my favorite coffee? No. Would I buy it again? Absolutely.

review/summary: Another great fruit flavored black tea
review/text: I have used a few other fruit flavored teas from Ahmad and other vendors that are usually available in specialty shops or high end supermarkets (i.e., Whole Foods). There is a dearth of fruit flavored black teas with flavoring more often reserved for green and white teas.<br /><br />As a black tea drinker from childhood, I have found it difficult to buy fruit flavored black teas at a reasonable price.  Ahmad's teas solve this problem.  The Mango flavored tea is especially good and is a flavor that I have not found before.<br /><br />Overall, great tasting specialty tea at a reasonable price.

I finally broke down and got this one, and was blown away. Its delicious. I normally drink my English breakfast tea with milk and sugar (I don't like it without both), and had been searching for a tea I could drink without milk in the office (they only have half&half packets, which are not the same, and I don't want to deal with bringing in my own milk just for tea). This is it. It does not need milk. Its delicious.

review/summary: Love my K-Caps
review/text: I was really skeptical when I bought these.  It seems like Keurig/Green Mountain has such a monopoly on the K-cup market that there are really no good alternatives out there.  Well after some experimenting, I was happy to find that this is a good alternative for me.  My first attempts didn't go so well.  I took a few tries to get the strength right, it's amazing what a difference an extra 1/2 teaspoon can make.  I was using freshly rinsed cups too, which gave the coffee a weird flavor.  Now every other night, I dump the grounds in the garbage, rinse them out well and leave them to air dry overnight.  I think having a dry filter is important in the taste.  I save the clean cups and make them fresh each morning, I don't make them ahead of time either.  I use each K-cup about 3, maybe 4 times and then start fresh.  My husband still drinks the bold style K-cups, so I use those.  I am pregnant, so since I am limiting my caffeine intake, it is very easy for me to make a half-caff or very weak blend in the cup.  I've had no problems with leaking, only if I use the cups too many times.  All in all I am very pleased.  This has been a huge money saver, especially since K-cup prices have drastically gone up everywhere.  It literally takes me about 2 minutes every other night to clean the cups, I can handle that for the money saved.

review/summary: Good, but with problems
review/text: It is wonderful being able to use your own teas and coffees at much less expense.  But that advantage comes with a disadvantage also, which for me is worth putting up with until something better comes along, though at times  is very frustrating.  The disadvantage is that liquid comes through not only the opening designed for it, but also all over the place making quite a mess.  I've tried all kinds of ways to try to stop this, but it is a necessary evil and you need to wipe down the coffee maker (and surrounding counter)after each use.  The lids fit snuggly on the k-cups, but, it appears the spout that goes into the hole does not fit as snugly as it does when it punctures a real k-cup, thus causing water to go over the sides...and/or it backs up through the hole (due to spacing) and runs over the edge.  However, the end result, the brewed tea/coffee, is good, so I will put up with the deficits for the moment.

review/text: My husband and I have been using these for a couple of months and find them to work great.  They do not leak, as others say, and there are no more grounds or sediments than with the purchased cups.  And, the options are greater.  I suggest using the sprayer with hot water to rinse them and more of the oils will be removed.

review/summary: My-Kap
review/text: The K-Kaps work great.  I have told a number of friends who own Keurig coffee makers to purchase them.  I love the idea of grinding my own coffee and reusing the cups to make my coffee.

review/summary: What a great idea!
review/text: These "Kaps" really do work. I find that I need to use a dark roast with a finer grind and fill the cup all the way to get coffee sufficiently strong for my taste, but have never had grounds in my coffee or had to hold the handle down. My only issue (besides the fact that my mug is large and I have to empty and refill the cup to brew a second cup to fill the mug - time consuming in the morning for a machine that's supposed to be quick and a time-saver!) is that the hole in the top of the Kap doesn't line up if I drop the cup in over the old hole. I have to turn the cup so it's tilted (creating a new hole in the bottom) to get the top needle to line up and slide into the hole in the Kap. A very minor annoyance. As soon as I got my Keurig I realized that I'd be irritated putting out all that money for K-cups and went looking for a cheaper and "greener" alternative -all in all a good investment!<br /><br />**update** I contacted the company about my off-center needle and they very kindly sent me replacement Kaps with slightly larger holes, free of charge! Now they work without a hitch. GREAT customer service!!!
