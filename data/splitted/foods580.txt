review/text: Previously, these lemon wafer cookies were sold at Wal Mart; however, they no longer carry them.  Recently, I discovered that Trader Joe's carried a chocolate version and I inquired if they carried the lemon but no, they discontinued carrying the lemon as well.  So, I googled and found that Amazon.com was a source for the cookies.  YES, I can now satisfy that craving for a truly lip smacking little lemon wafer.  While I ordered only one box of them the first time, I will be ordering two boxes the next time--I have a friend and her husband who also enjoy puckering up!  Try them, you will love them!

review/summary: Special treat
review/text: I tried this product at a friend's house and had to get some for myself.  I was delighted to find them on Amazon for half the price listed on another so called wholesale site.  These make a great treat and would make a wonderful gift if you can keep your hands off of them.  Everyone who tried mine thought they were much better than they had expected from such a simple product.  Having no hydrogenated oils is a definite plus, but watch the saturated fat if cholesterol is an issue for you.

review/text: I first tried these cookies while visiting family in Panama.  They were available at the local grocery stores.  When I came back to the U.S. I couldn't find them locally but thank goodness for AMZAZON, I found them and at an affordable price.  I order a carton of eight packages and share them with friends.  They are a delightfully light and fresh tasting treat that soon become nearly addictive.  I have tried some of Loacker's other flavors but the lemon is my all time favorite.  I am tempted to subscribe to them!!

review/summary: Real Nice. Light Fresh Lemon Taste. Mmmmm.
review/text: Here's another of the little items I find in my nearby Fresh and Easy store. It's a British company and they have a lot of imported items. This trip I picked up a bag of Loacker Quadratini Lemon Wafer Cookies. Oh boy, are these good! They disappear real fast. Be ready to apply controls. They're very light and tasty and not overly sweet. The filing has a real light, fresh lemon taste. Real nice. Just right. Just give it a bite and a couple light chews and it's gone and your hand is involuntarily reaching for another one. Mmmmm. Now how am I ever going to keep these around the house? Well, I guess that a lot of others feel the same way. Did you notice that on the 33 reviews, 30 gave it five stars?<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: WARNING: Addictive!  Ohhhhh so good!
review/text: These wafers need to come with a big warning "Addictive"! It takes a lot of self control to stop eating them.  If I did not exercise a lot of self control I would eat a whole bag. Wafers come in a resealable bag, and in theory can last a long time... but in my house the longest one bag lasted was 2 days!<br /><br />I bought the lemon flavor of Loacker's Quadratini wafers. They have a nice strong lemon flavor - nicely tart with a sweet creamy finish, crunchy and pleasant on your tongue. You can chew a wafer to get the pleasant crunch on just hold it in your mouth and let it melt slowly.  Either way you will get an extra ordinary taste experience!<br /><br />I am attaching a photo and two cookies shown from different angles.  Each cookie is 1 inch square. Each consists of 74% lemon cream and 26% wafer.<br /><br />Wafers have no artificial flavors or colorants, and no preservatives.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Unbleached wheat flour, pressed coconut oil, glucose syrup, sugar, whey powder (milk), dextrose, soy flour, barley malt extract, lemon juice powder 2%, salt, leavening agents (sodium hydrogen cargonate, disodium diphosphate), emulsifier soy lecithin, natural vanilla pods, lemon-peel-oil, spices.<br /><br />Loacker wafers are made in Austria and Loackers company had been known for their wafers since 1925.<br /><br />Ohhhh, so good!

review/text: These are essentially the yummiest, most delicate wafer cookies I've come across. The hazelnut tastes exactly like Nutella, perfect. Each little cookie is 0.5 Weight Watchers points, which is terrific for those of us watching our figures. I usually have four cookies (2 points) with my tea and am VERY satisfied. They taste so decadent. I'm going to try the Lemon next and hopefully will be able to track down the Espresso flavor!

review/summary: Melt in Your Mouth
review/text: I opened the box when I had two friends visiting!  They went home with at least two packages each as they were having weekend guests.  I still have a bunch.  They were a hit. They are so fresh and so satisfying. I just ordered the chocolate ones for next time.  I plan never to be without them.  I want them on the tea table always.  Trust me.  Read the label - they are great.<br /><br />So, I am adding to the review!  The two friends who were here when the cookies arrived,  I had shared some of the cookies with them  raved about the cookies, wanted to know where I got them and are ordering them.  One had a house full of guests and I had given her 2 sacks, knowing she was having Pumpkin Festival guests - she said they all want these cookies.  I think they are all natural products so that helps.  I have the chocolate ones in my shopping cart but am holding off as I am eating too many,  I ate - alone - one sack on the weekend.  I dare not open more this week.  You have to try these.  I am sure I did not dream about them.  They are not too sweet.  I think you can read the ingredients.  Great for people with braces.  Sigh!<br /><br />OKAY, OKAY, OKAY - I AM BACK TO ADD ON . . . I just bought the dark Chocolate - I don't even like dark Chocolate so I chose that as friends will like them for dessert and I won't be tempted (fat chance) to eat them.  I know I will.  These are the best cookies ever and my lemon ones went so fast.  You will love these cookies!

review/text: I ran across the dark chocolate ones in Italy at an Autogrill highway rest area.  There were snacks aplenty, but the picture on the bag + the fact that it had an extra 20% attracted me.  So, I got a 10.58 oz bag!  I find them satisfying after eating just a few.  It seemed like a never-ending bag.  I googled when I got home, hoping to figure out where to buy more, and ended up here.  I'm glad I did because, after reading some other reviews, now I'm anxious to try the lemon ones!

I have a sweet tooth and traveled the world (so I have tried many sweets) but nothing compares to these wafers.<br />Also there is one other flavour Amazon does not seem to sell and that is the coconut wafers. Absolutely unbelievable taste and this is an understatement. It has the perfect combination of sweetness, flavor, size and once you start eating it you cannot stop.<br /><br />My favorite are Tiramisu, Lemon, Hazelnut and Coconut. The rest are fantastic too but I have my own I like the best. Italian products - cannot improve on perfect.<br /><br />Watch your waist line though  :P

review/text: I have to say I was looking forward to getting my favorite cookie, without paying the local $4.89 per package.  I always buy from Amazon whenever the price is right, and they have what I want.  The packages of wafers came as expected, however when I got them, one package had it's seam split and wafers throughout the box and they were less then fresh.  The other packages appeared to have gotten excessively warm as the wafers had slid off of each other, causing a "slanted' wafer.  Not the upright wafer cookie I expected.  All in all, I will take a second look before I buy eatable items from Amazon.

review/text: I really wanted to enjoy these flax crackers. I like the fact they are organic, raw (dehydrated at low temp), etc. They are a healthy snack food, although they are difficult to eat without plenty of liquids (they kinda congeal/clump in mouth, making it hard to swallow). That having been said, they are simply overpriced. If you have a dehydrator tray or some ingenuity, you can save 90% (a pound of organic flax is about 2$). I prefer the Foods Alive brand instead, if one absolutely must buy pre-made flax crackers (Their mexican flavored are very good, and do not contain liquid aminos (soy), like this brand does, for those who avoid it)

review/text: Compared to the Numi Oolong loose leaf teas, this one is about half the price.  The loose tea is comprised of almost all leaves, with just a sprinkle of sprigs.  In the mouth, the tea is mild with slight roasted quality, quite harmonious but not very distinctive.  It is a pleasant but definitely lacking character, especially when you compared it to the Numi Iron Goddess or Bao Hai Oolong varietals.  Nice for the money, but I think I would rather pay twice as much for a better Oolong.

review/text: Before trying this tea I had only had oolong from a tea bag. I found this to be a nice full leaf tea. The first cup I made was a bit "earthy" for my taste but since I am dieting and I wanted something affordable enough to make at least 3 cups a day. I did some research.I found that some recommended improving the flavor with "waking up" the leaves by pouring a small bit of hot water on them and then draining it off and adding fresh water for steeping. I also read that Oprah likes to spice hers up with a mix of cinnamon, allspice and cloves. Wow both those tips really made all the difference for me. I love this tea made that way and I love the price. I may try a small amount of a more expensive brand just to compare but for the price this combo is going to be hard to beat.

review/summary: Love This Tea
review/text: This is my favorite tea bag tea, it has the best taste as is...just add hot water, no milk, cream or sweetner of any kind is needed! I wish I could buy it when I do my grocery shopping, but lacking that getting it here is good. I have friends in Plano, Tx that can buy it in stores there and ship it to me which is nice! Just an FYI  if you know anyone in Tx.

review/summary: Looked high and low for this tea
review/text: I love this tea! It has a light crisp taste with a hint of plum flavor and it smells fantastic! I started drinking it years ago when I lived in Nashville, but after moving to Michigan I had a super hard time finding it. I found it on walrmart's website but its a much better deal here on amazon. I haven't found a tea that matches it in taste and bargain. My boyfriend hates tea, but now he can't get enough of this!

review/summary: Healthy & Delicious! Only 8 grams of Sugar
review/text: I stumbled on this fruit snack at our local grocery store. Our children take snacks to school everyday and I'm always looking for something healthy and low in sugar and carbs for them.  This was one of my lucky finds! Here's a quick comparison against another one of our HEALTHIEST regular snack purchases:<br /><br />Stretch Island Fruit Leather.<br />One flavor per box. 8 strips to a box, 9 grams sugar and 12 grams of carbs. For roughly $3. an 8 count box.<br />Stretch Island has a grainier leathery texture and my kids like them.<br /><br />Florida Natural Fruit Stiks<br />Assorted flavors, 12 stiks per bag, 8 grams sugar and 10 grams carbs.  For roughly $3. a bag.<br />Florida Natural has a slick, chewy candy texture that reminds me of Laffy Taffy.  I absolutely love the taste and taffy-like chewiness!<br /><br />As you can see, compared to the very healthy Stretch Island Fruit Leather - these Florida Naturals come out cheaper due to greater quantity, less sugar, less carbs and more assortment.<br /><br />So they are my FAVORITE fruit snack choice. :)

The sticks are very chewy so may not be ideal for younger children unless they suck on them. It takes a lot of chewing to get these down but doesnt bother my son or I. I highly recommend this product over most fruit snacks that have high fructose, food colorings, and other artifical flavoring. The price can't be beat either!

review/summary: This is not JUST erythritol!
review/text: Some folks are complaining that it's too expensive for JUST erythritol.  But this is organic erythritol fermented from cane sugar.  The Emerald Forest brand mentioned elsewhere in these reviews is not organic and certainly therefore derived from corn, which is cheaper. What's the big deal, you ask?  Well, I clicked on the Emerald Forest brand 44 lb. bag, and it's manufactured by Cargill--the big pharmaceutical and agri-business giant.  The corn they use is most likely genetically engineered. (Think Monsanto)<br />It's worth it to me for health reasons to use the Zero, although I do sympathize with others who feel it's pricey.

review/summary: Depends what you use it for
review/text: This stuff is a pretty good sugar substitute, but it really depends on what you use it for.<br /><br />If you are planning on using it in baked goods, I'd suggest that you not. The "sugar" has a slightly cooling effect when you taste it (it's hard to explain).  I tried to make cookies with it just to see how they would turn out, and they had that weird sensationy taste to them.<br /><br />This "sensation" (taste isn't the right word) is not very noticeable if you use it in small amounts, such as on cereal, on fruit, in smoothies (AMAZING)...and I'd imagine in coffee (I don't drink it, so I don't know).<br /><br />Organic Zero is sweet, and for the most part, it tastes--and even looks--like sugar (it's basically a sugar alcohol). Again, I would recommend it in small quantities, but not for baking purposes.<br /><br />$20ish dollars is an EXTREMELY good price for two packages. I bought some at my local co-op and ended up paying about $15 for one bag.<br /><br />If you're into artificial sweetners, I'd say it's worth a try--it doesn't have scary things related to it like aspartame and nutrisweet do.

review/summary: Super substitute
review/text: I bought this for my husband because I don't like him using the pink packets, and this seemed a healthier alternative.  I bought this at Whole Foods, but I think I'll buy it from Amazon from now on because it's almost half the price.<br /><br />I tasted this before dumping it in his coffee, and it tastes wonderful.  One of the other reviewers mentioned a "cooling" sensation - it does taste like you're eating something cold, even though it's room temperature.  It's kind of like mint in that way, but not mint-flavored.  I put a little in my own coffee (usually I prefer coffee black, but I'm testing it for this review) and it didn't give the nasty aftertaste that "pink" (saccharine), "blue" (nutrisweet), or even "yellow" (splenda) gives.  I also don't have a headache, which I get from "yellow", but then I didn't put much in my coffee - maybe a teaspoonfull.<br /><br />I'm nervous about health issues, but since this is made from fermented cane sugar, I can't think of any health issues that this would have, as opposed to saccharine.  I looked it up in Wikipedia, and the article on "erythritol" is informative and nerve-calming.  You should read the article if you're curious, but apparently erythritol (which this product is) is safe, has almost no side effects (like gas or bloating) unless taken in HUGE quantities, and is even safe for your teeth.  It also mentions the "cooling effect".

review/summary: Bought mine for baking -- with TERRIFIC results
review/text: I have been building up my gluten-free repertoire for some time now, but getting the sugar out of recipes has been a REAL HASSLE.  Stevia and Xylitol are both MUCH too sweet-tasting for me, although the glycemic load is lower.<br /><br />I also don't want carcinogenic chemicals as substitute sweeteners.<br /><br />I bought this product to try in my Easter Cake and it is DELICIOUS.  It hasn't elevated my blood sugar at all.  I will buy from Amazon using their subscription plan and lower my cost that way.<br /><br />UPDATE, December 2009: Because ZERO is expensive, I use half Zero, half organic sugar and this is an excellent way to reduce the glycemic load of most baked goods.  Most recipes start with way too much sugar, so I generally halve the total sugar to begin with, then use 50% ZERO and 50% sugar to fulfill the sweetness requirement for the product without murdering my budget.<br /><br />Best price off the shelf so far has been $10 per 12 oz. bag on sale at Whole Foods Market.  Check it out!<br /><br />THANK YOU, WHOLESOME for an excellent product.  Peace.

review/summary: Spendy, but non-corn source is worth it.
review/text: For me, the source of the sugar being organic cane sugar and not corn makes it worth the price.  I don't use it too often though since I believe it is one of the most if not the most expensive brand of erythritol available.  We have a corn allergy in the family and this is the only one I've found that is not made from corn.  If there is another cheaper brand not derived from corn, I'd love to know!  Corn subsidies would explain why other brands can be so much cheaper, it's just not worth it for us to chance a reaction.<br /><br />For baking, I recommend using only part erythritol and some other form of sweetener.  Of course, if the dessert will be chilled it's not so much an issue since the mouth cooling effect will go largely unnoticed.  If you are avoiding sugar altogether, the more forms of alternate sweetener you use, the better flavor you will get.  One tip for working with erythritol is to powder it in a coffee/spice grinder or magic bullet.  Otherwise it doesn't dissolve well, especially in cold liquids.  Adding a touch of honey works well to round out the flavor and it only takes a tiny bit since honey has a strong flavor.  A little bit of stevia is good too.  I use the erythritol most often when I am trying to desugar for a while and for one particular favorite treat.  I recently made some almond flour blueberry muffins with part Splenda, part Zero and part liquid stevia.  They had great flavor, even the kids loved them.  I don't prefer using splenda though and when I am done desugaring I will go back to part evaporated cane or muscovado sugar and part erythritol.

review/summary: Does not dissolve, not sweet, tastes like tin foil
review/text: I'm a user of liquid stevia and i was looking for something i could use for baking.  The sweetener never dissolves with the wet ingredients, and, when your baking cools off, you have crunchy crystals of this sweetener in your baking. I even tried dissolving it first by warming up the wet ingredients, it appeared to dissolve, but after cooling i got the same results.  The other reviewers say that you tune into the taste in order to taste it.  I agree, if you use too little, it does not sweeten (you can't taste it), and if you use enough to taste it, you've ruined what you are trying to sweeten with it's nasty tin foil taste.  Dont bother using it for coffee or tea, because it sinks to the bottom of the cup because it does not completely dissolve even in hot water.  I should also mention that its not sweet in the slightest bit.  And i've been off sugar for years, so it's not because i'm used to real sugar.<br /><br />Bleh.

review/summary: Great for tea- not too sweet
review/text: I drink a lot of tea - black and herbal.  I wanted to find a sweetener other than sugar for obvious health reasons.  Zero is less sweet than sugar, but it doesn't have that overly strong sweetness of Stevia which I can't begin to deal with.  Zero is an excellent balance, and it's ORGANIC! It looks like sugar (no surprise since it is fermented sugar cane).<br /><br />  One reviewer said it has a certain mild  "cooling sensatioin".  I agree, but its so insignificant, I've completely "forgotten" about it. The Wall Street Journal reviewed 4 sweeteners.  Zero was their favorite.  Truvia was next; they said it was a little sweeter perhaps, but tasted a bit like cotton candy.<br /><br />  For a product that is zero calories'  zero glycemic index, zero GMO, tooth friendly, & digestion friendly, Zero is worth a try.  I'm keeping my eyes peeled for an inexpensive source.<br /><br />  I haven't baked with it yet; I liked someone's suggestion to go half &half.

YUM YUM!

review/summary: Aside from the price, This is great stuff
review/text: I bought this quite a while ago and put it on my shelf, using it sparingly because of the price.  I do not have a huge sweet tooth, having tried to omit sugar almost entirely for health reasons for a long, long time.  But I do have my sugar addictions, i.e. Coke and ice cream, but when my health is bad as it is now, I have to eliminate it totally for weeks just to feel decent.  When I went to buy this again at my health food store, they had stopped stocking it, so I forgot about it.  I just found what I had left in my cupboard and did an online search, finding in on Amazon as usual.  I had thought the product had gone out of production.  I am now going to make fresh limeade with it for the rest of the summer.  Prepared lime aide has corn sirup.  Yuck.  We are eating so much corn in our prepared foods that corn allergy is inevitable.  (Allergies to foods develop when one food is over consumed.  I developed an allergy to soy, not from eating soy, but from exposure to it as an additive in other things)  I can't praise Zero too highly.

review/summary: Expensive and irritated my throat
review/text: First off, this stuff is expensive.  When I actually sat down to calculate the cost per serving, it came out to be around 75c per cup of tea sweetened.  That's true because 1) it's not cheap per pound and 2) you'll use quite a bit more than you expect per cup of tea, coffee, etc.<br /><br />Next (and last), it irritated my throat.  For me, at least, that "cooling" sensation that most everyone else has mentioned also resulted my throat being sore while I drank my tea and for a short while thereafter.<br /><br />It was worth a try but not worth repeating.

This is a great product, although seems to be on the expensive side.  We use it as a coffee sweetener, and add organic lite chocolate soy milk for extra flavor.<br /><br />Hopefully it will become less expensive as it gets more popular.  Definitely a healthier option than Nutrasweet.  We'll keep buying this product.

review/summary: Too Expensive, but I just love this stuff!
review/text: This product is too expensive for what you get... It's great stuff but the price is too high for everyday use of this product.  I got the packets at the health food store 35 packets for $[...]. That's too expensive. And the funny thing is it is in an oversized box so  you think your are getting more than 35 packets. I assumed it was 80 packets enclosed but when I got home and opened the box I was a bit pissed off because the packets barely  lined the bottom of the box. I don't know why they put so little in such a big box... no wait, I do know why... they want to mislead the public into thinking they are getting more than 35 packets for [...] bucks!  I do love the taste and the fact that it is organic and comes from organic sugar cane. Most other erythritol comes from non-organic corn. As far as I can tell this is the only product made from organic sugar cane. I've called almost every company too! If they just could lower the price I'd be a happy camper! Oh, it is as addictive as sugar though, thank god it doesn't have calories!

review/summary: Definite Aftertaste
review/text: I bought this product because my Splenda in 9.7 oz packages became unavailable.  I was willing to give it a reasonable try but I just don't like the flavor.  It's not exactly bitter, maybe chemical-like is a better description.  It makes my tea taste off and leaves an unpleasant tingle on the tongue.  So, it does look like sugar though it is less sweet, but I don't like the taste.  And, I think, for the price, you aren't getting anywhere near enough product.  A twelve oz. bag of this stuff is about the equivalent of a 2/3rds full sandwich bag.  I was quite disappointed overall.

review/summary: Zero'd Out
review/text: With all of the buzz about artificial sweeteners, I am open to finding an alternative to Splenda. I indulge in an occasional Diet Coke, but have been looking for something to sweeten coffee in the cooler weather and my iced green tea or iced coffee in the warmer months.<br /><br />I brewed a gallon of green tea and chilled it. Since some guests prefer sugar or unsweetened, I normally add sweetener when I pour a glass of tea. The first time, I poured it in a see-thru sport bottle to tote along with me during the day. I added some "Zero". It didn't dissolve. I stirred. Still didn't dissolve. I let it sit for a while, still didn't dissolve. Tried sipping it - all of the "Zero" was still at the bottom. Shook ferociously. Left on counter for hours, thinking room temp would help. (Nope) Five days later, the "Zero" in the see-thru sport bottle, still hadn't dissolved. I eventually poured it out. (As an odd note: It left a white film on the lip of the bottle opening.)<br /><br />So I brewed a 1/2 gallon of green tea and added some "Zero" to it while it was still warm. It dissolved. Then I put in fridge to cool. Poured a glass - I used a generous amount of "Zero" - but the level of sweetness was marginal.<br /><br />I'll wait until cooler weather and give it a shot for sweetening my coffee, but I find it to be a poor performing and pricey useless product.

review/summary: Great for cereal and porridge
review/text: With any substance that might be used by a large number of people, it would be commendable if health promoting bodies and manufacturers collaborated to produce reliable statistics on rates of adverse effects and consumer acceptability, as well as proposed benefits. In the absence of this we have to go on a combination of patchy data and anecdotes. This review will seek not to duplicate needlessly information from other reviews.<br /><br />Amazon reviewers often note surprise at quantity needed; it's important  to distinguish bulk sweeteners such as sugars itself, and the "sugar alcohols" xanthitol, erythritol etc versus highly potent sweeteners such as aspartame, stevia, and so on.<br /><br />I'd confirm that erythritol works well for me in porridge and cereal, though I do not normally need them very sweet, so the quantity I use may be comparatively small. At that level I have not noticed any worsening gastro-intestinal problems.<br /><br />Contrary to what some have suggested, Erythritol DOES occur naturally in small amounts in regularly eaten fruits but that only assures us that it is not highly toxic. The gastro-intestinal problems presumably linked to non-absorbtion seem to be dose-related and perhaps also individuals vary in sensitivity.<br /><br />If we consider the very substantial health risks of diabetes and "morbid" obesity, then it seems that at least in these groups of people the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. It's worth a try! For the general population the disadvantages including cost put it probably on at best an equal footing to other minimal calorie sweeteners.<br /><br />Current producers for retail include: Now Foods, Wholesome Sweeteners, and Emerald Forest<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Z978SS">NOW Foods Erythritol Natural Sweetener, 1 lb</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QKE59U">Emerald Forest 5lb Erythritol Sweetener</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JDTO4">Emerald Forest Erythritol, Single Serve Packets, 100-Count Single Serve Packets (Pack of 3)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E3IA">Wholesome Sweeteners Zero, 12-Ounce Bag (Pack of 2)</a>

I have had no side affects like they list as possible in other places.  But I have not consumed more than 4 spoonfulls at a time.  It does take more of it than real sugar but that it ok!

review/summary: A new study reveals that this may be beneficial for your health...
review/text: Recent article from WebMD about this sweetener.....<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />An artificial sweetener that's been shown to help people shed unwanted pounds may also lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels in people with mild or borderline high blood pressure, Chinese researchers report.<br /><br />The sugar substitute is called oligofructose, or OFS. It's used to replace fat or sugar and reduce the calories of foods like ice cream, dairy products, and baked goods. OFS has about 30% to 50% of the sweetness of table sugar, according to the FDA.<br /><br />The study involved 96 adults, ages 32 to 63, with mild or borderline hypertension. That means their systolic blood pressure reading (top number) was 120 to 139 and/or their diastolic (bottom number) reading was 80 to 89.<br /><br />The condition, also referred to as prehypertension, is a warning sign you may get high blood pressure -- a risk factor for heart attack and stroke -- in the future.<br />OFS Supplements Lower Blood Pressure, Cholesterol<br /><br />In the study, reported at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association (AHA), participants were given either 20 grams of OFS or a placebo daily for 12 weeks.<br /><br />"Beneficial changes in both blood pressure and cholesterol were observed in the OFS group," says researcher Dan Qu, MD, PhD, of Changhai Hospital in Shanghai, China.<br /><br />By the end of the 12-week period:<br /><br />  * Systolic blood pressure dropped an average of 6.9 points in the OFS group, compared with 3.5 in the placebo group.<br />  * Diastolic blood pressure decreased an average of 7.3 points in the OFS group vs. 2.3 in the placebo group.<br />  * Levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL or "bad" cholesterol), and triglycerides also dropped more in participants given OFS than in those who took placebo tablets.<br /><br />Surprisingly, people in both groups dropped an equal amount of weight, Qu says.<br /><br />"OFS supplements lead to reduction in blood pressure and improvements in lipid metabolism in [people with] prehypertension," he says.<br /><br />"Further research is needed to see if taking the supplements for a period of time would decrease the [risk] of heart attacks and stroke," Qu says.<br /><br />Asked to comment on the findings, AHA spokeswoman Alice Lichtenstein, DSc, a nutritionist at Tufts University, tells WebMD that "the study is very interesting. But we need further study before we can make recommendations about whether people should take OFS supplements."

It is a great alternative to Tylenol which has been known to cause liver damage and is a drug that isn't very good for you to take unless you have to. Now I don't have to worry about taking Tylenol for my headaches as much because this usually does the job, and I get about 1-2 headaches a week. If this doesn't help you with headaches if you are like me, try feverfew usually available as a pill, but in my case, not fast acting and only effective 30-40% of the time. Maybe feverfew would work for you, but in my situation I would highly recommend easy now over feverfew!

review/summary: For Taco Bell Fans Only
review/text: This review applies both to the "Chipotle" and the "Spicy Ranchero" flavors, neither of which tastes much like anything identifiable. The base is a thin mayonnaise made from soybean oil, chemically dyed to vivid and rather odd colors. To that are added various natural and artificial flavors to create a strong, though only moderately spicy, flavor.<br /><br />This isn't really a sauce and it isn't very Mexican. What it is is the sort of bright-color/strong-flavor condiment that kids like to squirt over everything. Juvenile palates are evidently what it's intended for. Since that describes the clientele Taco Bell targets, it should go over well with them.

review/summary: Just spicy enough - not overwhelming
review/text: I found this a fine addition to both a chicken and a steak sandwich.  I wanted a bit of extra kick without going overboard, and this sauce provided it.<br /><br />I also tried it as a dip for corn chips, and it wasn't a bad back up option in the absence of other dips/sauces.<br /><br />The taste was a bit too tangy, in my opinion and the smokier notes could have been emphasized more.  I am not sure they have the blend of flavors quite calibrated for a smooother finish.<br /><br />In the end, I just didn't feel like anything particularly stood out about it.  There are other, similar products that I have used and truly loved - and this sauce is not what I'd reach for instead of them.

review/summary: Smoky, spicy, bbq flavor
review/text: This creamy sauce has a good amount of spice to it, which really complements the smoky, BBQ flavor. I enjoyed this unique sauce.

review/summary: A matter of taste
review/text: I really don't know how to rate this sauce as it really is a matter of personal taste.<br />As a dressing I found it too spicey but as a spread on sandwiches it was too mild, not rich enough.<br />I tried it mixed with mayonaise to make it a bit richer and thicken the consistancey on salad which worked as a bold mayo.<br />Best on beef, burgers & sausage on hot wraps/sandwiches but not on cold.<br />Not something I'd buy again but that's just my taste speaking, it's a quality product and some will like a great deal.<br />I'm just not one of them!

review/summary: 2nd favorite of the new Taco Bell sauces
review/text: I have actually tried all three new Taco Bell Sauces, the Chipotle which I am reviewing now, and also the Jalape&ntilde;o and the Spicy Ranchero sauces.<br /><br />The Chipotle is my second favorite of the three. (I like the Spicy Ranchero the best). It definitely has a distinct smokey peppery chipotle taste to it, with of course the creamy base.  This sauce goes well on taco salads and (as I used it on) beef burritos.  I suppose you could use it for french fries or tacos as well.  I felt that because the sauce had such a bold flavor that probably its uses would be more limited than the Spicy Ranchero flavor that was much more mild and subdued.  But if you like a bold chipotle flavor I think this would really be for you.<br /><br />The bottles are squeeze bottles but I found that they don't squeeze out easily once you are half way done with the bottle.  You have to store upside down in the fridge or be forced to really shake the bottle to get the sauce to be forced down the the top.  Sauces are thicker than traditional salad dressings.

review/summary: Not bad, not great, just okay
review/text: I tried this chipotle sauce on a sandwich. It was not bad. But it was not great either. Just okay. The taste seems a bit bland, and more of a me-too, mass-produced flavor that you might see in a fast-food restaurant than something original or tasting special. Given that this is a Taco Bell product, that's not surprising.

review/summary: Not bad but not something I would buy more of
review/text: My family and I tried this sauce last night and found it to be kind of like ranch dressing with smoky salsa mixed in.  We didn't find it to be a bad taste but certainly not something that I would search the isles for in the grocery store.  Personally I like spicy and perhaps because this wasn't spicy is why I didn't find it really appealing.  It may be good if it was used as an ingredient in a basting sauce or something like that.

review/summary: Bold in calories, but not on flavor
review/text: The flavor of this creamy, ranch-like chipotle sauce is very mild, with a hint of smoky, cheesy pepper flavor.  It tastes okay, and it goes well with tacos to complement the taste.  However, it didn't knock my socks off.  For those concerned about nutrition, 2 tablespoons of the sauce come in at 110 calories.  To me, something that rings up that many calories ought to really blow you away taste-wise in order to make it worth it.  There is a long list of artificial ingredients (which may explain the bright orange color).  The sauce overall is fairly bland, not bold as the label suggests.  Those who prefer spicier, fresher flavors at a lower nutritional price tag should probably look elsewhere.

review/summary: Tasty, Mild and Versatile
review/text: I found this sauce to be delicious and suitable for Mexican food or even a general purpose sauce that could kick up a sandwich, omelet, or stew with a seriously tasty Chipotle flavor.<br /><br />The hot sauce addicts who tasted it were disappointed. It has lots of flavor, but no real kick. But, these are guys that put the super hot pepper sauce on everything they eat - I'm not sure how many taste buds they really have left.
