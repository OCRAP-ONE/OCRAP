review/summary: Always have this on hand
review/text: I keep Gerber 'Mixed' and 'Barley' on hand all the time. The 'mixed' consists of rice, oat and wheat so I mix a box of that with a box of the 'barley' and have a completely balanced breakfast cereal. I don't use it for people: I keep it handy for when the dogs have upset tummies and their regular food is too harsh on their digestive systems and they need soft, easy to digest food that fills them up and is healthy for them.  As their tummies return to normal, I reduce the baby cereal a bit and add in some of their normal foods and as they continue to improve, the baby cereal gets reduced while their normal foods eventually return to full bore.<br /><br />This is good for them, too, after dental cleanings/extractions, surgeries, when they need a little help in the 'bowel' department (fiber), or just as an added treat to change it up a bit in their daily diet.<br /><br />I have used this in place of bread crumbs when making a meatloaf (ok, I was desperate), but didn't care for the texture of the meatloaf once cooked. It was too soft for our liking, but still quite tasty.

review/summary: Delicious Espresso Beans!
review/text: Before I ordered these, I had never had white chocolate covered espresso beans. I always enjoyed the dark chocolate variety so I decided to give these a try.<br /><br />Quantity: First, the quantity is great. On my order, my "case of 24" actually contained 26 individual packs. I don't know if this is always the case, but it was a nice bonus for me. Little actions like this go a long way when winning over my customer loyalty. Each bag is also 2oz but I think there is actually more in each package than this. The entire shipping weight was over 4lbs so you do the math there! A+ here.<br /><br />Packing: The individual packaging is fine, albeit a little plain. Each pack has a UPC but not whole in the top, so if you are shelving this for resale, you will have to put a hole in it to shelve these. Not a big deal, but worth noting at least. B- here.<br /><br />Taste: Now here is the important part. These beans are some of the most delicious I have ever tried. They taste like a vanilla coffee drink (due to the pure vanilla in the white chocolate) and they taste absolutely delicious! I will try to just eat one or two at a time but that never seems to happen. The espresso beans taste fresh and have a smooth, roasted flavor. I also think the sweetness of the white chocolate offsets the bitter coffee taste better than any other variety I have ever tried (dark chocolate, milk chocolate, etc.)  A++ here.<br /><br />Overall, if you love espresso bean candy -- BUY THESE NOW!

Plus it doesn't have MSG like some of the other canned curry pastes out there. Give it a try!

review/summary: Delightful tea, good value
review/text: I normally use loose tea rather than tea bags since it tends to be less expensive and more flavorful. But on occasion it's more convenient to use a tea bag. These make a very nice cup of tea - good black tea flavor, strong but not overpowering. One bag per 8 oz of water comes out just right for me.<br /><br />I like that it comes in a round bag without any strings or wrapping - easier to use, less waste, and easier to compost.<br /><br />Definitely a step up in taste from the usual bagged decaf, such as Liptons, and much better than store brand decaf black teas. Excellent value if you can get it on sale.

review/text: Do not be fooled by the "British Blend" label, this is not British tea! We Brits like our tea with a lot of flavour. I frequently purchase Tetleys decaf tea in the UK and this does not even compare. It is weak and tasteless and even doubling the amount of tea bags per cup doesn't work. Perhaps the regular decaf is better but in my opinion, if you like a more full bodied tea experience,this is not for you.

review/summary: Not so decaffinated
review/text: This tea has a nice taste but is not very decaffinated. My husband has rather significant reactions caffinated beverages. I thought this would be a step up in quality from the local decaffeinated tea from the grocery store. It is a nice blend from a taste angle but left the consumer with vertigo - dizzy, headache and nausia. In fairness to the tea he tried it a second time and had the same reaction. If you are looking for a less caffinated tea this might be fine but it is certainly not decaffeinated.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: If you're going mainstream with your coffee, Peet's is the way to go. It's not burned, has a great robust flavor that doesn't get watered down by simple additions. There's nothing more annoying than making a should-be strong cup, adding a little half-and-half and then wondering where the flavor of your coffee went. Peet's has a large assortment of grounds as well, which is nice if you're the type that likes to venture from the ordinary with different traditional coffees. I used to drink Starbucks, but their coffee is routinely burned and acidic. This is well-rounded in comparison and strong, without being too bitter.

review/text: The first reviewer must not have much experience with Roquefort cheese they are ALL salty! I have eaten many different varieties of this luscious cheese and this is by far the best I have tasted.  Pair a couple of thick slices of this well-marbled cheese with grapes, sliced apples and other fruits plus a nice wine (white is my preference). You can eat this as is or make fromage forte by adding 1 tbsp of butter, 1 pack of Philly Cream cheese, as well as grated cheddar, mix well with a fork and spread on crackers. Delicious! I will purchase again. What a great Roquefort!

review/summary: Authentic Roquefort
review/text: The half-wheel Papillon Roquefort arrived via FedEx chilled, using reusable chilling packs (Hello, injured athletes), reusable foil bag, reusable durable carton.  The taste and and fall apart creamy cheese texture are indeed supreme; however, this Roquefort cheese's lingering taste is that of being over-salted.  The salt simply overwhelms Roquefort's purpose; creamy bulk, distinct blue breaks.  This product would go well with group wine or beer tastings, crumbled over salad or pasta.  I rate the product 5 stars, as not all eaters share my aversion to preservative salting, and not all eaters have experienced Roquefort Francais.<br /><br />Clint Williams

review/summary: A perfect treat
review/text: While these are a little pricey they are well worth every penny.  The organic aspect is nice but what really is wonderful is the lack of artificial dye.  I know, you're wondering so how are they colored if there is no dye?  Well they use all natural things, tumeric, black carrots.  Sounds gross right?  I totally thought so as well when I first read the ingredient list but I've always been happy with Annie's products and one of my sons has some behavior issues that are really effected by certain dyes, plus they just aren't very good for any of us, so I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />My entire family is hooked!  The texture is softer than most gummy candies yet you still get a nice chewy experience.  The hardest thing is to remember that these are more of a candy than just a snack.  It's easy to fall into the "healhty' trap and forget that although these are soooooo much better for you than most gummies, they still are a gummy candy snack.

review/summary: My Dog Loves This Food
review/text: I have a 12 year old golden retriever.  I have been feeding him Happy Hips treats for almost a year hoping the glucosamine helps with his arthritis.  He eats the treats like crazy.  I like the fact they are apple, banana, chicken and sweet potato.  They are healthier than store bought treats.  I have the same hope for the chicken & oats dry dog food. This dog food came the other day, I cut the bag open to dump it into a plastic tub and by mistake I tipped it over a little and some of it went scattered all over the floor.  Well, my dog with the arthrtis jumped right up and cleaned up the floor in no time, tried sticking his head in the bag and then wagged his tale licking my face.  If this is as good as the treats, I know it will help with his arthritis.  Amazon is the cheapest I have found for this food, plus the free shipping is a bonus.  I bought mine when Amazon had a 20 percent promotion so it was an added bonus.  Thanks Dogswell and Amazon.

review/summary: Hooked On Happy Hips
review/text: It's simple really, My dog is a very picky eater, not to mention she's allergic to so many things. We tried a lot of the name brand dog foods out there (Iams, Avoderm, Science Diet). Nothing worked, so then one night when she was out of food I went to the store and grabbed two small bags of dog food. Happy Hips was one of them. She immediately wanted to smell the bag right after opening it (which she never did before), and as soon as we put it in her bowl she devoured it. With all of the dog food we had previously given her we always had to mix it with something just to get her to eat it, that wasn't the case with Happy Hips, she ate it dry the first night and is still eating it dry 2 months later. She always got bored with the other dog food, after a couple weeks she would stop eating and/or put her nose up to it. She doesn't do that with Happy Hips. She absolutely loves it. Plus it's all natural and made in the U.S.A. You pay more for it, but it's well worth it. If you have never given this to your dog, it may be best to start them off with 4 pound bag or find somewhere you can get a free sample. But I would strongly recommend this to anyone who has a dog. I have also found that Amazon is so far the cheapest place to buy this dog food, and when I buy it, I get the free shipping as well.

I first had switched her over to the Happy Hips formula and saw that she walked without a limb for the first time in over a year. This took about six months, but was noticeable after about 4 months of eating Happy Hips. I was so pleased with the outcome that I transitioned my smaller, older dog to Happy Hips. My little dog, Steeler, was having back issues as she is getting older. After about 6 months eating Happy Hips, she is out running around like a puppy...she is now 13 years old. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a pet with joint problems or may have those issues later down the road.

review/summary: This food really made a difference in my dog's joint health/pain
review/text: My dog was 8+yrs old when I first bought Happy Hips by Dr. Dogswell for him to try - within a week my dog went from stumbling and walking slow, and occasionally buckling in the front shoulders during tight turns, to frisking like the younger dog he used to be - no buckling, back to a trotting gait, and no evidence of pain!  I've kept him on the food for the past two years, occasionally mixing in other food for variety - but this stuff really made a difference for my dog, so I'm swearing by it and recommending it to others.  I had been supplementing his previous food (Pedigree) with expensive pills that promised improved joint health, and they never seemed to do anything.  Now my dog is just primarily eating the Dr. Dogswell food (no supplements, but occasional mixing in of Newman's Own or Rachel Ray's food for variety) and he's still doing great.

review/text: I am delighted with this food. It looks nice, smells really great, has a smaller size kibble for my old dog's teeth, and comes in a ziplock pouch. More importantly though, my old dog who was getting a little lame has suddenly gotten frisky again since starting on this chow. We have also noticed that the terrible flatulence he had daily is gone too. To be fair, at the same time I switched his wet food to Harmony Foods, so that may also be a factor. I am extremely happy with this food and will continue to buy it.

review/summary: Happy Hips Dog Food
review/text: My dog is very picky about her food and she has a lot of itching problems.  We have been told many time that her skin problems may have something to do with her diet.  We have tried many types of food, but this one seems to work best.  She really likes it and, although itching problem hasn't gone away, it does seem a little better. I am no health food expert, but based on what I am told by some Vets, this is a healthy product.  Final assessment: The extra cost of this food is worth the benefits of her eating more regularly; that she is eating a healthier food; and her itching seems to be somewhat relieved.  Also, I like having the bag delivered to my house at no charge in 2 days.  Schlepping big bag of dog food from the pet store  to my house is a pain.

review/summary: My Juvie, Standing With Comfort, at Last!
review/text: I was looking for dog food from Amazon.com so I wouldn't have to drive so far when I noticed this Happy Hips dog food.  I take care of my daughter's dog.  She lives in an apartment with her cat and couldn't take this sweet chow mix home with her when as a stray she entered her work place and make a bee line right to my daughter.  We are all dog people and so she asked me to take in another stray.  Soon after our little Juvie began to drag herself around.  We took her into the vets and her hips are really out of whack.  There was nothing we could do or afford.  She seemed happy but very inactive.  After I began feeding her the Happy Hip, which she loves, she began standing more and even playing with the new puppy.  I began feeding my other dog (he is two years old now), mixing the old food with the Happy Hips.  He will eat all the Happy Hips and leave the old food until I admonish him to finish his dinner.  Both dogs are really happy with Happy Hips.

review/summary: My dog enjoys it and it helps her hips.
review/text: My dog was diagnosed with hip dysplasia as a 6-month old puppy.  The vet said it was the worst case he'd seen in a puppy her age and we were told that she wouldn't be able to walk by the time she was three if we didn't have an expensive surgery done.  I've tried various supplements and foods over the years and although she may sway a bit when walking and tire easily she's now 8 years old and we frequently go on short hikes together.<br /><br />I started feeding her Happy Hips about 4 months ago.  Since that time I've cut out any other supplements and paid close attention to how she does.  She readily eats the food and doesn't gorge herself when eating.  She seems to have more energy and stamina now.  I don't want to push her too hard but last weekend I took her on a 4 mile hike over aggressive terrain, much more than we normally do, she led the pack the whole way and even jumped in the truck quickly when we were done.  In the past I've had to lift her into the truck at the end of any hikes.  She spent the rest of the day sleeping but the next day was up and going again.  Overall I'm very impressed with my dog's health and since this has been her food over the last several months it has to be a factor in how she's doing.  I originally was going to rate this 4 stars but really have not complaints at all and my pup is doing great so I upped it to 5 stars.<br /><br />As a side note I read reviews online before feeding my dog this food and found that it is rated well by a few independent review sites.

review/summary: This Food is Absolutely Fantastic
review/text: My overweight little girl not only got down to a healthy size; but was cured of her lameness thanks to this food. Several years ago, she began walking on three legs.  The leg pulled to her body didn't seem to cause her any acute pain--she just didn't want to use it.  Vets and specialists armed with x-rays and other tests conferred and couldn't decide what was wrong with her.  A $7000 surgery was suggested; but I tried this food fist (coupled with Happy Hips chicken jerky treats).  After SIX months of being lame, within three weeks she was walking on all four legs and never had the problem again.  She has a shiny coat, bright eyes and lots of energy (she's nine years old).<br /><br />I would be a wreck if this ever went off the market.<br /><br />Also of note, this food seems super-healthy: no by-products, no fillers, no yucky things.  It seems as whole and healthy as you can get whilst using a manufactured dry food.  And even better, it has all her favorite table foods to eat--blueberries, chicken, sweet potatoes, apples, carrots, etc.<br /><br />There's a serving suggestion on the back of the package.  My dog is about 10 pounds and I feed her 1/2 cup of food a day.  (1/4 cup in the a.m. and 1/4 cup in the p.m.).  When she's super active (or seems terribly hungry), I give her more.  Also remember I supplement her diet with Happy Hips chicken jerky treats and the occasional raw fruit or vegetable when I'm cooking.  In short, a 4-pound bag lasts her three weeks to a month (if you're wondering how much to order on the subscription plan).<br /><br />Let me know if you have questions.

review/summary: Sr. Lab loves this food!!
review/text: Our 12+ yr old lab has been a finnicky eater for the past few years.  I've tried anything and everything to get her to eat. This food was new at our grocery store and I thought I'd give it a try.  She loves it!!!  This is the first 'dry'  dog food she eats without any extras ( fruit, veggies, meats etc)  Yesterday, the first day, she ate approx 4 cups of this food, typically she doesn't eat that much.  Well, let's see if that was a fluke, this morning she ate another 2 cups.  This food isn't really dry, it's a bit moist.  It smells great.  I can't believe our dog is eating it, much less so much of it.  I plan on getting the larger size bag from Amazon and trying some of the treats.

review/text: I've complained about the expiration dates when ordering from amzaon. This had the same problem. While the ingredients look decent, even though it has chicken meal, my dog was not thrilled with this food at all. She's 9 yrs old and I thought the Glucosamine would be beneficial to her. So even though the dog food is going to expire in 4 months, I've ended up having to give it away to someone else as she just looks at the food and back at me like "Really you expect me to eat this" I will say that she is a very picky eater. So it maybe great for others, just not for my dog.

review/summary: Not good food
review/text: I had my dog on this food until he developed an infection in his anal glands. My vet told me not to use this food anymore because it is made in china and the glucosamine in the Happy Hips formula provides no benefit to my dog because the amount of glucosamine is too small and its not a high quality. He had us switch to Royal Canin<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00068K2OK">Royal Canin Dry Dog Food, Giant Breed Adult 28 Formula, 35-Pound Bag</a> - so far our dog is doing really well with this food, firmer stool, loves to eat it, etc. And for the glucosamine/chondroitin/MSM we are using Dasaquin<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MCVGEA">Nutramax Dasuquin with MSM for Large Dogs - 150 Tablets</a> which is a pharmaceutical grade supplement, same manufactorer makes a supplement for human consumption as well.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor- buy a solid supplement and a dog food that is not produced in China.

review/summary: Best Soup I've ever had from a package/can!
review/text: I have tried a lot of canned soup over the years for an easy and quick lunch and none of them compare.  This is the first soup I've had in ages where the chicken isn't tough or dry.  It tastes like real chicken and doesn't have that icky soup texture that most canned soups w/ chicken have.  Also, the vegetable and beans - they give you a good mix of all items.  It's not loaded w/ the cheapest ingredient and only give you two chunks of the good tasting veggies that cost more.  Plus the flavors are well rounded and it doesn't have that chalky canned soup taste that most soups have.<br /><br />I like to squeeze in some fresh lime juice and add a small spoon of light sour cream and this is a great, satisfying lunch that will stick w/ you.  I will be putting this on my subscribe and save plan when I need to order next - so yummy!!<br /><br />Also, if you have dietary restrictions like I do - I cannot eat gluten or yeast - this soup fits the bill.  Thank you, Pacific, for making quality products that aren't chock full of stuff that doesn't need to be in them!!

review/summary: Almost expired, don't buy!!!
review/text: I received a case of these (12 count) on April 4th. They expire April 12th. That's plain ridiculous. Won't be buying again - giving me a touch over a week to use them when they are a CONVENIENCE item for 90% of parents, not a regular meal item that you use daily. Not worth the $ savings - I'll buy the equivilent in beechnut at a certain national chain for $1.06 per meal and have a long expiration over this.<br /><br />Be warned, you are gambling on expiration with these.

review/text: I first had this tea at The Cheesecake Factory. It was delicious. When I got home, I looked it up on Amazon and found both tea bags and this large bag of loose tea for sale. Let me stress, this is a BIG bag of tea. Actually, TWO BIG bags. I had no idea two pounds of tea could be that large. It comes in two 15"x11" bags that are several inches thick. I'm not complaining at all - this tea is delicious. And the price is phenomenal compared to the tea bags. Thanks, Numi, for the great deal!

I hadn't noticed sooner because the name was the same so i thought the recipe was going to be the same. I was kind of disappointed with this new recipe, the Hops are completely different! But we decided to try it out.<br /><br />We have since brewed, bottled and tried it, it's pretty good and we have gotten some good comments from our friends, BUT I LIKE THE FIRST RECIPE BETTER. i'll be checking the recipes from now on to make sure i get what I've already tried!

review/text: I certainly recommend this brew.  Not difficult to make, and very tasty.  Was a little slow to ferment, so make sure you monitor your gravity before bottling, as it took an extra week mine to complete.  It does condition quickly in the bottle, though.  I'll be brewing more of this very soon, as everybody seems to like it.

review/summary: Delicious, but not as pictured, and take note...
review/text: These are delicious butter toffee almonds. There's just the right amount of saltiness and sweetness that you simply can't put them down. They're even better if you warm them up just a bit - they become more aromatic and the toffee simply melts in your mouth.<br /><br />Don't expect anything like what you see in the picture, however. The toffee is a little clumpy and inconsistent, as it usually is on butter almond toffees. The picture looks like what these might look like before the toffee has dried, but you would never clump them in a bowl like that before they were dry... it's not clear why that picture even exists.<br /><br />Also, of note: Lang's Chocolates is the company, and Butter Toffee Almonds are the product. Don't buy this if you were expecting chocolate toffee almonds. Those are another treat completely - there is no confectioner's sugar or chocolate on these.

review/summary: Not just for babies!
review/text: I grew up on this British baby biscuit and was SO happy to find that Amazon sells it (my Mum was sending it to me by post!).  As a child and even now as an adult, I loved/love dipping it in milk (only briefly, so it doesn't dissolve).  It's only lightly sweet so it's perfect for young kids instead of snacks that are loaded with corn syrup.  It's safe for a baby who is teething because it dissolves rather quickly on contact with liquid (saliva) though, for safety, you should still always be close by when the baby is eating it.  Only snag: have a vacuum ready to suck up the crumbs after eating!

review/text: So, we get the impression that this Zoe extra virgin olive oil would be a discovery in excellence in taste.  Well, I'm Puerto Rican and I've been dousing goodies with olive oil since my father started  pouring it onto my "viandas" and avocados when I was only a kid.  We used Goya extra virgin then.... and we still use it now.  This Zoe olive oil is not bad, it does taste good, but it misses the aroma and somewhat pungency of what I'm used to.  I'd buy it again, sure, if it's offered at a special discount, but people underestimate other more economical and popular brands.

review/summary: Great Quality, Pretty Good flavor
review/text: I had high expectations for this olive oil by Zoe. I really wanted to like it as I am incorporating more olive oil in my diet because of its health benefits.<br />Unfortunately, it tastes "off" to me and it has a heavy, oily flavor. I realize it is, after all, olive oil so it should be "oily," but I wish it could be oily without tasting oily.<br />I thought it was because I was use to using a lesser quality olive oil and I just needed to get use to using a higher quality one. However, it is just getting worse tasting to me, not better.<br />I will give the company high compliments on the can -- it is gorgeous.<br />I am doing my research on other olive oils so I can try again.<br /><br />UPDATE:I am upgrading my review to a 3 star rating because I have tried two others and find them also so-so. I think I have to concede that I personally do not like the taste of olive oil. I hate to give Zoe a bad product review because of my personal likes and dislikes. I can tell it is a high quality product, so if you like the taste of olive oil, I would recommend this as one to try. And as I said, the can is attractive and something you would be proud to leave out on your counter if you use olive oil often.

review/text: I decided to give ZOE brand olive oil a try since I was running out of my previous batch (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WHLZW8">Bertolli Classico</a>). I'm really glad that I did because it tastes excellent and is a better deal than the Bertolli. The first thing I noticed was its darker color (a true olive green, not nearly yellow like cheaper olive oils). I used some to prepare a pasta sauce, and was very impressed with the aroma when I fried the garlic, and even more impressed when I tasted the end result. I'm not an expert on olive oils by any means, but I generally know what I like and what I don't like, and ZOE really does deliver. This is a premium first cold press olive oil (the highest grade of olive oil) and it is very delicious!

review/text: Yes, that is correct. I buy many things on amazon, and 99 percent of the time it is good. I checked the code on bottom of the can and it was made in 2000. As I writing this it is 04/08/2011. Olive oil does not get better with age in a tin can. I went on the zoe website to see how to read the code on the bottom of the can. On the zoe website click on blog at the top right hand side. It had on my cans the l= lot number, 00= year olive oil was made. I called Amazon right away to report this to them, and explained where I found this information. They agreed with me and issued me a complete refund. I don't blame Amazon for these old olive oil cans, but I do blame Zoe (New York City based Company). They supply Amazon, nationwide and slipped some old stock through thinking no one would notice. Guess what I'm from New York City , I know how these guys operate. Zoe may be good Olive oil , but check the codes often. You can find the code information on any Company website.

review/text: Good olive oil.<br />From the Zoe website blog:<br /><br />___________________________<br /><br />We have a new lot code system, which was brought into effect this year. Here's how to decipher them:<br /><br />The first four digits identify the bulk lot number.<br /><br />The next two digits are the year that the oil was bottled, and the final three digits correspond to the day of the year that the oil was bottled, using the Julian calendar.<br /><br />For example, if you come across the following lot code on the bottom of your tin, this is how you would decipher it:<br /><br />L-000111052<br />Bulk Lot: 0001<br />Bottling Year: 11<br />Julian date: 052 (February 21st)<br /><br />This means that the oil was bottled on Feb 21st of 2011. It doesn't expire until the end of Feb, 2013!!<br /><br />Olive oil is good for at least TWO YEARS from the bottling date, and can last for longer if it is stored properly (away from direct sunlight, at room temperature).

review/summary: Best Value in Price/Quality
review/text: I grabbed this on a special because it was such a good price for a quality olive oil. When I first tasted it, I was somewhat disappointed, because it had a strong "green" flavor, like the olives hadn't fully ripened. I relegated it to cooking and foods that it would be mixed in with, like hummus. Over time, I have grown to like it more, and now occasionally even use it for drizzling on salads and other foods where the olive oil's flavor is a stand-out part of the dish.<br /><br />I usually drizzle a little EVOO on top of hummus when I serve it along with kalamata olives, feta cheese, tzatziki and tabbouleh. Mmm, one of my favorite meals! I use the Zoe when I make the hummus, then use my favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BFG56A">'Nunez del Prado' Flor de Aceite Olive Oil Glass by La Tienda</a>, for the drizzle. I have bought it in a 1 Liter tin at my local upscale grocery store, but it is more expensive than the Zoe. I discovered Nunez de Prado when I asked them to let me have an olive oil tasting (like a wine tasting), and this one was by far my personal favorite.<br /><br />The special addition you get by drizzling the oil over many different foods really adds a lot of dimension and flavor, so you really want to get one that you love.<br /><br />Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this oil for the price, it is very good quality, though it's not my favorite.

I saw the Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil as a Gold Box special, read the reviews, and decided to give it a try.  The oil arrived promptly, was well packaged, and there was no damage to the tins.<br /><br />This olive oil has a nice golden color, a lush mouth-feel, and a pleasant peppery after-bite.  The olive flavor is distinct, but not over powering - something that makes it nice for individuals who prefer a milder taste.  In my opinion, the actual taste was a bit nutty - but taste is subjective and very individual, so you must judge that aspect of this oil yourself.<br /><br />When using this oil as a part of my Italian Butter, I did cut the ground black pepper componant so that the other ingredients were not overwhelmed by the pepper taste.  That recipe takes 12 ounces of oil, pepper to taste (usually 6 turns of the grinder), ground sea salt (6 turns), 2 garlic cloves grated on a zester or crushed,  Mince 1 1 /2 teaspoons each of fresh oregno, fresh rosemary, and of fresh sweet basil.  Add all to the oil and allow to steep for several days before using.<br /><br />Unlike better oils, Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil does not give a harvest date or a specific location from which the olives originated.  If you are an olive oil afficianado, this is something that may concern you.  However, if you are looking for an excellent olive oil, at an outstanding price you should give Zoe a try.  I found this to be equal to Costco's Kirkland Extra Virgin Olive Oil in the 1 liter bottle.

review/summary: Love this olive oil.
review/text: I have been using Zoe for about 3 years and think it's the best olive oil for the price.  I've tried many expensive Italian and Greek oils but I still keep coming back to this Spanish oil.

review/summary: A truly great and richly flavored olive oil
review/text: We use a LOT of olive oil in our house.  We use it in cooking, for salads and dressings, etc.  And this one has to be my favorite.  It has a fantastic and rich aroma and flavor, it's simply a joy to use.  Probably the best-tasting one we've tried, and we've tried SO many brands!  I will definitely continue to buy it here from Amazon instead of the stuff they sell in the supermarket.<br /><br />  I also love the tins that it comes in.  It keeps the oil fresh and keeps the light out, not like those horrible clear bottles!<br /><br />Plus, I liked the pop top, it was easy to use and easy to pour.  Overall, you will NOT be disappointed!!

review/summary: Great Value
review/text: I was looking for an olive oil re fill at the market and could not find anything that I liked.  Everything that looked decent was way over priced and there just was not a great selection.  I always forget to look for food on amazon but it struck me and after a quick search I found the Zoe.<br />This olive oil is a good value for the quality and quantity you receive.  Its got a nice darker color and olive flavor.  This will be my everyday oil to use in pans, cooking, and even a fast salad if I dont feel like taking out the expensive stuff.

review/summary: Cool looking container, fails at pouring though
review/text: It's impossible to pour out of this container without making a mess.  I am looking forward to having the container as a decoration, but man is the pouring annoying.<br /><br />The olive oil tastes better than what you get from a normal grocery store, however it's not really extraordinary.
