review/summary: A little too much flavor
review/text: These things are good when you eat a few, but it's a little hard for me to finish an entire bag since they're so full of flavor (salt, herbs, etc). I have an entire drawer of them and am always reluctant to grab a bag for lunch since I don't really look forward to a mouthful of flavor. I was hoping they'd be a little more subtle like Cheezits (spelling?). This would be good for people who like a ton of flavor, but other than that, you probably won't like them enough to eat all of them.

review/text: Not gonna b.s. you on this, these are now my must have snack chip of choice. As far as a zesty, savory snack chip, these cannot be beat. I have tried all three flavors, and none are bad. Chili Nacho Cheese are by far my favorite though. In fact, after I write this review, I plan to buy another case.

review/summary: New formula - Texture STALE, many CRUMBS, downsized to 1.2 ounces.
review/text: I bought this product before they reformulated it, and of course now. This product has definitely changed for the worse. The texture is not crispy at all, and even borders on tasting stale. There were many crumbs in the bag, and the package has been downsized from 1.5 ounces to 1.2 ounces. Not much to like here anymore. I will be removing it from my subscribe and save. What a disappointment, because I really did enjoy them before.<br /><br />I am not allowed to review them independently but, there are several flavors if this product. At this time the Lemon Herb is still 1.5 ounces and the original formula. This could change at any time. I ordered another 12 pack of them before that formula also inevitably changes - they were terrific.<br /><br />C'est la vie

review/summary: Not doritos - but pretty good!
review/text: If you're expecting something as good as doritos, then you'll be dissappointed.  My family has eaten these for at least 3 years as my son had food allergies.  So, we're not necessarily eating them for the nutrition, that should say something.  They're good enough to eat just because.<br /><br />It is a personal preference.  If you generally like soy items, than you will probably like these.  The soy taste, light as it is, is what most of my friends don't like about them.  Kids seem to like them better than adults.  And, I would say the parm. & the nacho flavors are better.  However, we like these too.

review/summary: Tasty, Messy High Protein Snack
review/text: As part of a high protein diet, I have conducted a broad search for the most protein-rich foods. It is easy to find cheeses, meat, and protein shakes loaded with protein. It is much more difficult to find flavorful high protein foods that are traditionally carbohydrate rich.  Kay's makes a few good snack offerings that meet this requirement, including the Parmesan Cheese protein chips. At a cost of approximately 0.05 dollars per gram of protein, the protein affordability is on par with reasonably priced cheeses and meats but more expensive than protein shakes.<br /><br />Taste is matter of preference but I can say these snacks are indeed tasty from my perspective. Yet, they don't taste like other mainstream snacks such as Doritos or Cheetos. Hence, you may be inclined to eat them in moderation.<br /><br />One big downside to this snack is the volume of crumbs created when eating. Oddly, many of the Kay's chips are far messier than mainstream alternatives. So, while Parmesan protein chips may make a nice snack while watching television, expect to eat over a large bowl or table napkin. Otherwise, you will have a mess of crumbs that will find their way into every crevice of your furniture.<br /><br />High protein foods are typically more expensive than foods rich in carbohydrates or fats.  So, I have recorded the nutrition of about 200 foods to find the best value in terms of lowest dollar cost/gram of protein. An excerpt is below. As you can see, the chips are a reasonably good value at 0.05 dollars/gram.  A typical strength athlete might need as much as 1 gram/kg of weight daily.  This would equate to about 10 dollars of chips per day for a 220 pound (100kg) athlete if eating nothing but Kay's protein chips. While not realistic, it gives consumers an idea of the expense involved. So, if you like the taste and can store a full case, they make a tasty component of your high protein diet at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />Pros<br />Taste<br />Moderate protein cost<br /><br />Cons<br />Extremely messy<br /><br />PARTIAL RANKED LIST OF PROTEIN RICH FOODS<br /><br />SOURCE .....

review/summary: A decent snack option for low carbing
review/text: I just received these, tore open the box, and snarfed down a bag.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other reviews, I did find these crunchy --they weren't soggy or soft at all. Overall, I like them because it's pretty hard to find salty crunchy snacks on a low carb diet. These compare to Medifast's Parmesan Snacks with the exception that these are flat and Medifast snacks are little balls, but overall the flavor is pretty much the same. Also, these are a MUCH cheaper option than Medifast or any of the other high protein low cal diet product, who charge about $15 for a box of 7. At the sale price of $9.25 for a box of 12, that's less than .80 cents per serving. Good deal.<br /><br />And, speaking of servings, I have a pet peeve for the manufacturer... the bag is 1.5 oz but the nutrional facts are based on a 1 oz serving. Gimme a break. Who's going to eat only two thirds of the bag and leave the rest? They tout 110 calories, but realize that you're actually going to get 155 calories, 5.25 grams of fat, 21 grams of carbs (not net carbs cuz this does have some fiber), and 15 grams of protein when you eat a whole bag. This still isn't horrible, so why not just tell us what we're going to get when we eat the whole little bag, which we will do :-).<br /><br />Also, these little chips do crumble easily. I think there were maybe 5 whole chips in my bag, the rest were smashed (but still tasty). Overall, I recommend this and for the price point, flavor, texture, and lack of other options. I will repurchase.<br /><br />Lastly, kudos to Amazon. I got free shipping through Prime and they were on my doorstep in 1 day.

review/summary: Great crunchy snack
review/text: Due to medical reasons I have to be on a high protein, lower carb diet.  These are a great snack.  It's nice to have something to crunch on instead of potato chips or tortilla chips.  The taste of these is okay.  I personally prefer the Kruncheez by Kay's Naturals.  While these don't totally taste like Parmesean, they do have a nice flavor.  The only reasons to not give 5 stars are that they don't really taste like the flavor specified, and each bag has 1.5 servings.  I really think the bag should be one serving when they are this size.

review/text: This is the first product I have ever reviewed.  I shop a lot on Amazon and rely on reviews and they have always helped me.  This product is so bad, that I felt I had to warn others.  I purchased it looking for healthy low fat snack.  First off, the package says low fat.  They may be low fat, but the chip is as greasy as they come.  Next, the chip has no snap too it.  It is soft and melts.  Not something you want in a chip.  Worst of all is the taste.  The cheese flavor is prominent but nasty.  Overall, avoid this product.  I should have been tipped off by the price, which is fairly low for a supposedly healthy and gluten free product in this quantity.

review/summary: Great alternative especially for fitness fanatics
review/text: When I opened up the whole case of protein chips, I was quite overwhelmed since I thought, WOW. Did I go a little overboard with this? I could not believe I bought a whole case without trying it first.<br />Anyway, I opened up one box just to taste it and it did not taste good at first. But as I kept on eating it, it just got better and better. I ended up eating this box all day periodically from morning till the end of my work day. Uh-oh, one box equals 5 servings. YIKES.<br /><br />As a fitness fanatic, I keep a high protein-low carb diet. This is an excellent substitute to my craving for potato chips and salty snacks. Unfortunately, there aren't that many healthy, salty snacks to choose from (I do not have a sweet tooth like the rest of the world). The Chili nacho flavor creates a party in my tummy, I wish it was spicy though but it does the job.<br /><br />So a whole case of Kay's protein chips?? Yeah, no problem!

review/summary: tastes great, filling, best "fake junk food" find
review/text: These really fill that need for something salty and crunchy while not actually being junk food. The nutrition info speaks for itself. The chips are small, so the bag takes a long time to munch through, so you don't feel like you took two bites and ran out. Their texture is similar to puffed rice/wheat/corn junk foods, like bugles or salsa fries. They kind of dissolve after the first initial crunch, as opposed to a chip made from a slice of potato, which just breaks into smaller hard pieces. This is my favourite flavor - the parmesean isn't bad, but this is really late-night-I'm-stoned-and-playing-video-games junk food goodness.

review/summary: Yes Yes Yes Thanks for Healthy Snacks Like This One
review/text: These "chips" are really freaking good for being so healthy. The thing is, you have to know what to expect when you are eating a high protein/fiber product like this one. It is not going to taste like a potato chip so kiss that fantasy goodbye if that is what you are expecting. I suppose some people have extremely refined taste buds when it comes to chips and have a hard time stomaching these. But seriously, they are extremely good, even you don't care a whole lot about them being healthy. They are crunchy and crispy and have a good dose of flavoring on them, and they are not too salty. These are perfect for people who want to add more protein to their diet in an easy way. I take a bag to school or on trips and they are awesome, especially good for days when I work out a lot. The price for these is really good too, especially if you score some extra savings with Amazon. As an afternoon snack, these beat anything you'll find in a vending machine price- and health-wise. It is products like this one that make my life a little easier so I don't have to struggle to eat healthy while being busy!

review/summary: One of the best low-carb snacks you can buy
review/text: If you're doing a low carb diet or even just want to cut down on them then these are really some of the best low-carb chips you can buy.<br /><br />Taste/Texture: They don't REALLY taste like chips but honestly its close enough to, say, a dorito, that it works. The texture is different, a little lighter than a chip which may be a positive for some people. You definitely get the chili nacho cheese flavor from it and in my opinion it's about the closest you're going to get to a "real" chip if you're looking for low carb. Haven't tried the other flavors though.<br /><br />Size: The bags are small, yes, but not that much smaller than a regular small sized bag of chips. You might find yourself eating more than one bag as a snack though.<br /><br />Price: Pretty good when you buy the bulk (12 pack) product although it works out to about a dollar a bag which IS a little pricey I guess but when you look at it as "12 dollars for a pack of 12" somehow, to me, it seems like a better deal. Also, if you like them, sign up for the regular deliveries and it shaves 2 dollars off each order AND includes free shipping so you really can't beat that. Considering the high price of a lot of speciality products (and this is) it's pretty inexpensive.<br /><br />Overall: A good purchase for low carb dieters, a tasty chip substitute, something even fans of traditional chips may enjoy. Good value.

review/summary: Decent alternative but not great.
review/text: These chips taste okay - although I probably would have liked the Nacho flavor better, they were 3 dollars more a case at the time I made my purchase. The main problem with these chips, is half of every bag is protein powder at the bottom of the bag, so your stuck trying to scoop it up with your fingers or end up just throwing it out. I guess, in trying to make them low fat, the oils that usually hold chips together is missing, so you end up with half a bag of crumbs. I ordered 3 cases and every bag is like this, so I don't believe it's an isolated problem.

review/summary: FABULOUS IN SOUPS AND LIGHT STEWS & SALADS!!!
review/text: These chips are wonderfully light and lightly seansoned and that allows one to use them in a variety of creative ways.<br />I have had gastric bypass and still have difficulty getting my daily protien intake because it is difficult to eat the protien they suggest.  However, with these chips and this flavor in particular I can travel with them and add them to just about any soup for a sustainable meal with crunch and nutrional value.<br />Unlike the more pronounced flavors of nacho cheese ( superb choice for football games etc.) I can enjoy these as a part of a meal even in salads.<br />Bravo Kays' for making such a wonderful product.<br />WHERE ARE THE CINNAMON ONES?  THEY MAKE A GREAT QUICK BREAKFAST!!!!!!!!!<br />M

review/text: The flavor of the chips are good, but the texture is a bit off.  They really douse the chips with Parmesan and herbs, but once you start chewing they start to taste really weird.

review/summary: Pretty Good - Very High in Protein
review/text: These are pretty good.  I mean, the seasoning tastes really good (I'm a sucker for good seasoning...).  I can't really say much about the crackers themselves as they don't really stand out in any way (this isn't to say they're bad, they're most definitely not), they're just crackers, EXCEPT---you get a great amount of protein from one little bag (a 1.5 oz bag has 15g of soy protein and 4.5g of fiber, which is not too bad).<br /><br />The calorie count for the same 1.5 oz bag is 165, the fat count is 5.25g, which isn't super great, but it's way better than the count from the same amount of potato chips and you're getting much more protein and also fiber, so not too bad if you have a craving for something salty and seasoned.  Also, they're just more satisfying.  You don't feel the urge to immediately eat another bag like you often do with chips.  Probably because of the soy protein and fiber, huh? &lt;g><br /><br />If there had been a choice for 4.5 stars, I would have taken it, but just couldn't go to the 5 for some reason, but I'll definitely be buying them again just to have on hand when the craving for salt and spice hits.  Which, unfortunately for me, is quite often.  Oh well, there are worse things I could do... &lt;VBG>

review/text: I am on a high protein, low carb, low fat, low sugar diet. More than sweets I crave salty chips and crackers, something to munch on in front of the TV. These are delicious! If someone told me they were bad for me I would believe it. They don't necessarily taste like anything else on the market...maybe a wheat thins toasted chip? They are very crunchy and light not heavy or gritty like other high protein crackers. The only downside is that each individual size bag is actually 1.5 servings and of course once it's opened, I am going to eat it all because I have no self control. These are going to become a staple in my diet from here on out, the perfect substitute for potato chips, without that guilty feeling after.

review/summary: Pretty darn good
review/text: I'll be honest, I bought these on a whim because I needed another item to push me over the minimum for SuperSave shipping.  I was browsing pantry items because I figured I might as well buy something I'd need anyways, and I came across these chips when looking for healthy snacks.  While I'm not typically a big consumer of "natural" foods (nothing against them, I just don't go out of my way to sneak them out), I try to stay away from obviously unhealthy foods and thought it couldn't hurt to try these as a substitute for less-healthy snacks like chips.  My expectations weren't very high, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that these chips are really pretty tasty.  They're salty and crunchy yet not greasy.  I'm not saying I wouldn't prefer regular old potato chips all else equal, but if you're looking for a healthy alternative and debating giving these a try, I say go for it (because we all know "all else" isn't really equal...).

review/text: After saying goodbye to chips about a year ago I've missed them.  Chips taste amazing am I right?  The bad thing is they are extremely unhealthy with tons of bad fats in them, including they have no nutrition.  It's just pure unhealthy.  As someone who is trying to get a lot of protein in their diet I had seen these.  Since I've missed chips so much I thought I'd try them.  The hard truth is while these are healthy the taste is really just not that good.  They're good enough to like them but not good enough to love them either.  I may buy more of this in the future but I may look for other products instead.  Just because these are great for protein, 12g protein, low fat, low calories, and decent taste Ill give these 4/5 stars

review/text: This was my first time trying this product and I enjoyed it.  I liked the amount of protein in the snack which is what motivated me to buy it.  The flavor was good (chili nacho cheese) and I will definitely try the others.  One big plus (besides the nutritional content) is the amount in each bag.  Usually with individually bagged chips I'm always reaching for more, but these have large portions in them that leave your crunch craving satisfied.  My only complaints (which are very minor) are that the bags are a little difficult to open and your fingers are left a bit messy.

review/text: the best healthy chip I've ever had. The serving size is quite satisfying and the taste can't get any better. I've had the parmesan and nacho cheese...the lemon don't appeal to me but I haven't tried them. They really are delicious and you won't regret buying them. Don't expect doritos or your conventional chip though. They are definitely DIFFERENT than your grocery store chip but really really good!

review/summary: Good, but pricey
review/text: I ususally buy Genisoy tortilla chips, but can't seem to locate them in-stock anywhere. So I decided to try the Kay's chips, because they are high protein also. They are good, but very pricey. I don't think I'll buy them again-  just didn't think they were worth the cost. I hope I can find the Genisoy chips soon.

review/text: I ordered both the Chili Nacho and the Parmesan. I found the chili nacho may favorite. I am vegetarian with a gluten sensitivity, so these are wonderful for giving me a healthy crunch with protein and no gluten. I have like these as well as most chips.

review/summary: OK but not as good as the big bags.
review/text: I bought this same product in a health food store in bigger bags... BUT I guess it was not the same in the smaller bags.  They were called Parmesan Chips but they were not as crunchy and they were full of parmesan.  There was almost too much parmesan on the chips in these smaller bags and it seemed as though at least 1/4 the bag is parmesan.  They just were not as good as the bigger bag.  Maybe it was a manufacturing error... but I will not buy them again.  I really wanted them for a protein supplement to my snaks.  OH WELL.<br /><br />If someone gets these and they are crunchy then I really would like to know that.

review/summary: Really not that good
review/text: Saw the bunch of 5 star reviews and thought I'd give these a try. So people complained about it being salty, but that wasn't the problem for me, since really, potato chips are just as salty as these. I think someone else called this taste "unnatural", and that pretty much tells the story. These chips taste like they were manufactured in a laboratory, and not actually the product of natural consumables. They look like corn chips but they seriously just taste like flavoring and oil and basically empty of flavor besides these. Not recommended.

review/text: I was a little wary of these due to the mixed reviews here. However, I'm glad I purchased them. I think the flavor is good and the chips are crunchy and taste fried to me. One drawback is that they are pretty small so it's tough to dip them without getting your fingers messy. They cheese can also stick to your hands. I actually like the taste of these more than the sour cream and onion Pop Chips I purchased in the same order. These also have great nutrition compared to those (10 grams of protein per serving, 15 per bag!) I will probably buy these again, they make a good snack.

Products that arent certified USDA Organic are just harmful to us, animal and insect life and of course our environment.  Bees that die prematurely are found to have genetically modified unorganic particals in them. It ruins pollination which in turn slowly harms our world.  I hope more companies become as environmentally responsible as Guayaki.<br /><br />Guayaki yerba mate does the trick, tastes great and provides sustained energy without jitters.

review/summary: Fabulous stuff!!
review/text: I had previously tried and loved an expensive balsamic vinegar but could not locate it locally to buy it. I decided to purchase the Mussini Crema, Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar to see if it was in any way comparable to the brand I had been using. It was as good and better, and best of all considerably less expensive. I am thoroughly spoiled and will never again use a supermarket brand of balsamic vinegar as a dressing. I use this drizzled on fresh tomatoes with just a touch of salt, pepper and fresh basil, in my salad dressings, drizzled over chicken, and even over strawberries. Also, since you usually use only a small amount, it goes a long way. It is syrupy with a touch of sweetness, totally unlike the usual balsamic vinegars. I am still trying new ways to use it, and so far everything has benefitted from its use. It has now become a staple in my pantry.

review/summary: Yum! I love this stuff!
review/text: Following is a duplicate of the review I wrote in May 2008 for this  product in its 5.7 oz size.<br /><br />This marvelous glop is the new absolutely indispensable addition to my pantry. A friend brought me some from Rome recently (different brand, Leonardo, which I'd prefer if only I could get it, but the Mussini's close enough and the price is right). It's rich and thickish, just a tad sweet, comes in a squirt bottle and instantly jazzes up--in both taste and looks--just about anything you choose to drizzle it over. It's my new salad dressing of choice--perfect over mixed greens with some nuts, fruit and feta, wonderful over steamed or grilled veggies like squash. The label suggests you can even use it over ice cream, which I tried once just to see and it actually wasn't bad, but I'll probably not do it again. It lasts longer than you'd think from the size of the bottle, as you'll only use a little at a time. I'm planning to try one of the flavors next. And come December I'll doubtless be giving lots of it as Christmas gifts. When I was running low on the stuff from Italy I went online trying to find a source for more and, wouldn't you know it, the only place outside Italy I could find it was on Amazon. Can't imagine sometimes why I ever bother looking elsewhere for anything (well, the new refrigerator maybe, although Amazon did even have a few of those, believe it or not.) Update, August 2008: Also try the fig flavor. It's especially good on fruit and salads containing fruit.

review/text: I purchased the Crema solely upon the reviews. I was a bit wary of "natural ingredients", I did not know really what that meant....so here they are directly from the label: cooked grape must, Balsamic Vinegar of Modena 39% (wine vinegar, cooked grape must) sugarmodified starch. (Contains sulfites).<br />The end result is a thick, hershey chocolate syrup consistency. Sparingly squeeze the Crema over fresh mozarella and sliced ripe beefsteak tomatoes with a few fresh leaves of basil, and your dish will rival the best caprese salad out there. The Crema is a tangy, sweet and balsamic treat for the taste buds. Highly recommended. The bottles will last you a long time as a little goes a long way. Buon Appetito!

review/summary: Not What They Used to Be
review/text: I grew up loving Breakfast Treats.  They had a light crisp texture, a pleasant, light sweet taste, not too sweet and not too bland.  It was just right.  They were delicious straight out of the package (my favorite, nice and crisp), dunked in milk, or with tea.  I noticed over the past couple of years that they taste different and are harder than they used to be.<br /><br />I've also noticed less variety of Stella D'oro products.  I've lived in NY my whole life and SD was always on store shelves.  A few of my family's old favorites are no longer available.  There used to be several good cookies.  The Anginettis, Angel Wings, Swiss Fudge, Christmas variety box...I don't see any of these in stores.  Angel Wings are listed on their website, but I haven't seen them lately.  My second favorite to the Breakfast Treats, the Pfeffernusse, was only available during the holiday season, like the variety box.  I looked forward to getting 2 or 3 packages every December.  It's gone, too.<br /><br />It seems they've cut down to 4 cookie varities, 3 Breakfast Treat flavors, and several types of biscotti and toasts.  I don't like biscotti or toasts much, and the ones I see from SD always look hard and dry.  They still make breadsticks, but they are very hard to chew.  My mom used to love them but she doesn't buy them anymore.  We used to love to browse the SD displays, now I just glance at them and think how boring it looks and go on my way.<br /><br />Apparently the company was sold to Nabisco many years ago, then sold to Lance 2 years ago, which makes Archway.  Sorry but I do not like Archway cookies.  At least Nabisco kept the Breakfast Treats and other products the way they had been in the 80s.  Until about 5 years ago when the products were arriving unusally dark/overcooked.  Now the factory moved, and recipes changed to inferior versions of the originals.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />The new Breakfast Treats are not awful, there are much worse cookies available than these.  They are okay, that's why I'm giving it 2 stars rather than 1.  But there is a very noticeable, unpleasant difference compared to the ones before.  They taste cheaper, have a different texture, and are probably made with cheaper ingredients.  Out of all the Stella D'oro products still available, these are the only ones I'd buy if I want a cookie that is like the old Breakfast Treats.  But that is very rare.  I don't like spending money on products that have been degraded.<br /><br />Please bring back the old recipe.  It was perfect.

review/summary: YUM YUM YUMMY YUM YUM!
review/text: I grew up in Pennsylvania and moved to Texas 11 years ago and they don't sell them here. I bought a box a few weeks ago and now I need, yes, NEED to buy another one! They are perfect with coffee, with TV, with the internet....they are always good! If you haven't found them where you live, then buy them here. It's the cheapest price outside of having someone from back home send them to you!

review/summary: Love Stella D-Oro  Cookies
review/text: These cookies were not available for some time.  Now that they are back in production, I hope more grocery stores will carry them.  To me, these cookies are great any time--especially with coffee in the morning when I am in a rush or as a dessert with ice cream.  Love them!
