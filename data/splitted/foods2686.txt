review/summary: Love 'em
review/text: I love these salt and pepper flavored Popchips.  The bag size is perfect for a snack.  I love them in the afternoon when I get home from work, or at lunch with a sandwich.  Of course since they are "salt and pepper", there's a lot of salt.  I have to watch my sodium intake and it limits the number of bags I can eat.  Also, I would like to see the salt and pepper flavor included in the variety box instead of the vinegar, which I don't like at all.  Tastes too strong of vinegar.  Would be great for someone who absolutely loves vinegar.  It would also be nice if you could create your own variety box with the flavors you most prefer.  It does get a little boring eating 24 bags the same flavor.

review/text: I have gained weight *not telling you how much* over the months and am putting myself on a diet. These chips have saved me from gorging on the bad stuff becaue of their taste. This product is not only healthy, but it actually tastes the best out of all of my other possible options. Frito Lay is the thing of the past, because Pop Chips are in! I strongly recommend this to anybody trying to maintain or lose weight, because with snacks like this, you can keep the love handles off! Thank you, Pop Chips for a successful diet! Go to [...] for any more info on how they are made.

review/text: I love the taste of pop-chips but, I think it is a little too salty. The manufacturer for some reason decided that it looked,tasted too healthy and decided to add extra salt to appeal to a broad audience.<br />I think they woul've been better served keeping the salt content low.<br /><br />I would recommend the barbecue flavor which doesn't suffer from the same problem. the worst I think is the sour-cream (or something like that) flavor. This one is ok.

review/text: We all have our vices, mine has always been chips.  Specifically, Bettermade BBQ chips, so as I'm trying to eat healthier I've tried to find a replacement for that craving.  I decided to give the popchips a try, thinking if they were at least okay I could replace my cravings for them.  They are better than okay!  These little guys are full of flavor and crunch!  And not to sound like a pig, but I could eat a half a bag of Bettermade in one sitting, but these little 8 oz bags, even though they are small, they fill me up!  I was shocked!  I am not kidding, I am eating healthier, giving in to my craving, and getting full from one small bag.  You cannot go wrong with these, even my kids love them!  I am thrilled to have found a healthy alternative to fatty chips!

review/text: I just love these chips! The BBQ are by far my Favorite. The BBQ flavor is a little sweet with a hint of smokiness, very addictive. They are light and as far as junk food goes they are healthy..'er than your regular chip. They do not leave your fingers greasy or any oily / greasy feel or taste in your mouth. That is because they are hot air popped and not fried. I almost ate the whole bag on my first taste; by the way it was the huge Costco size bag, twice the size of their large bags. With in two days I was back at Costco to by another bag. Like I said I just love these chips!

Excellent chip and of course you can enjoy it more knowing it has no cholesterol or saturated fat.  Fortunately the bags are small which helps you control your calorie intake.  But, they are highly addictive.  I have only tried the regular, but I will definitely be ordering some of the other flavors later on.  I recommend that every one try them, although at regular price they are quite expensive.

review/text: 1. All natural. Nothing artificial in 'em. No artificial colors or flavors<br />2. Low calories for a lot o' chips<br />3. Uber addictive taste-wise<br /><br />What more needs to be said? I'll be the first to admit, in spite of my being a weight loss coach in the evenings; I am not a big fan of diet food. I am a foodie. I love good food...love to cook it, love to eat it. Yet these, to me, are totally addictive. No fake diet food taste, tons of flavor. In fact, I HAVE to get them in the small bags or I will eat a whole large bag...it's one of those. Hickory, salty, hint of sweetness.<br /><br />They aren't fried or fake baked to taste fried.  They use a pressure cooker and the potatoes pop into a chip according to the bag.<br /><br />I got the automatic shipment of them from Amazon because it reduces the price by 15%and if I get 2 per month it allows for free shipping and, with the no tax, I can't get them in the stores that cheap and they are delivered automatically to my door this way.<br /><br />Also, these have a lot less salt than the old chips I used to eat...but they don't taste like its missing<br /><br />Negatives: These are still hard to find in some grocery stores.

They are only 100 calories and around 3 grams of fat and they don't taste like you are eating something healthy for you.  I love Cheetos and can't have them anymore and now love these chips.  The flavoring is not very strong but strong enough.

review/text: Love these pop-chips.  I've tried some other flavors too but found salt and pepper the best so far.  Original comes a close second for me.  Salt and vinegar is a very close third. Garlic is too strong for me (I love garlic in other forms though).<br /><br />I was hesitant to try these initially because I'm not a big fan of pepper flavor in chips, but am I glad I did!  The pepper flavor rounds up the chip rather than defines it, so it doesn't feel like you're eating pepper in it's raw form.<br /><br />It's a good thing the fat content is low because these are quite addictive.

review/summary: I wanted to love these...
review/text: I originally bought these chips because I'd heard great things about the company and their customer service, but I was a bit underwhelmed with the taste of the product.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- lower-calorie, baked-not-fried: this is definitely a huge plus!<br /><br />Con:<br />- I was expecting something more potato-ey. Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying "chip" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers. If you're looking for something with potato flavor as well as salt and vinegar, you might want to look elsewhere.

I'm not a huge fan of salt/vinegar chips, but at least it keeps me from eating them quickly (it lets me nibble).

review/text: I was really hoping to get a really great nutritious & delicious snack for my family when I ordered this product.  I was really disappointed.<br /><br />The packaging is really good looking and I had high hopes, so when I opened the package to my chips, I expected something great.  I ordered the Chili Lime flavor and, since, I have had higher-fat chili lime chips in the past, I'd knew that I would love them.<br />First, they don't really look like what they appear to be on the packaging (no big deal though).<br />I took a bite out of the first chip and it had a really funny texture and strange flavor.  So, I looked on the back where it showed the ingredients and I was pretty surprised--it had a LOT of chemicals in the product.  Also, AND THIS REALLY FREAKED ME OUT, the main ingredient is not a sliced potato, but, "potato ingredients (potato flakes, potato starch)".  In other words, it's made of instant mashed potatoes!<br /><br />I thought the taste was funny and the ingredients curious.  However, there are no transfats or saturated fats in the chips (that's why I gave it 2-stars).<br /><br />All in all, I would rather pack my kids lunches with a bag of Lay's or Kettle chips than give them these chips.<br /><br />All The Best.

If you have ever eaten "Funyuns" the onion flavored rings made by Frito Lay you have already tasted pretty much what Popchips taste like, just without the onion flavoring.  If your not concerned with calories, but simply want the best potato chip you can buy, try "Grandma Utz" potato chips, a true potato chip.

review/summary: Delicious and a little bit nutritious....
review/text: Not greasy or salty like a traditional chip, these actually tend to be more satiating as a sweet snack than a salty one, at least in the sweet potato chip variety. A handful of these is a sufficient pick me up and relatively wholesome, with just around 100 calories. The sugars are low too so even though you feel like you are having something slightly sweet it's really not going to spike your sugars (I think around 3g per serving). Overall these are a great little snack that you can feel good about eating.

review/text: I've tried most of the Popchips flavors, and the barbecue flavor is my favorite. It has a sweet spiciness, but nothing is overpowering; just the right balance of smoke, sweet, and spice, they're all good, but the barbecue has the most robust flavor.<br /><br />Popchips are a good choice for those who are trying to trim a few pounds. They're tasty and filling, but relatively low in calories compared to traditional chips. I parcel mine out into sandwich-size reclosable bags to help with portion control, and still manage to have a satisfying snack that fits in my program.

review/summary: Best Popcorn-type Chips of 6 Brands I Bought & Tested!
review/text: I wanted to have "sized" portions of chip-type product that would be tasty and filling.  I tried at least 6 different brands of popcorn-type snack packages (unfortunately, most came in 24-36 item packages).  After receiving the first 5 brands, I felt they were total waste of money.... 2 had texture of light styrofoam peanuts, with almost no flavor.  A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.  PopCorners White Cheddar brand came in SECOND.  Nice crunchy texture and pleasant cheddar flavor

Most people really like them once they try them and get over the 'Oh, it's a HEALTH food' thing!  They are not as healthy as eating fruits and veggies, and are still chips, but they are a much MORE healthy alternative to your regular chip.  And they do still have an excellent taste!  Sour cream and onion is amazing, but so are the other flavors!  (Whatever your person preference is!)

Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear "all natural no fake flavors" - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced -highly processed, sweetner from starch and a source of carbs.<br /><br />So aside from the weasel words in the label the product is fine  I just wish they wouldn't try and pretend to be something they are not - they are  snack food - we expect some downside

review/summary: Pop Chips Barbeque Potato Chips
review/text: My local store was running a special on these, so I decided to give them a try.  They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation "spices" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/text: I really like pop chips, but this flavor isn't the best. I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste. This wouldn't be so bad, except they taste overwhelmingly of tomato and celery. The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds.

The sad thing is that these are hard to find at stores.  You'll find plenty of the other Popchip flavors, but not the sweet potato.  So I broke down and bought a box.  I went with the 3-ounce version because the price per oz was lower than the smaller bags.  These bags aren't TOO big, and I just use a clip on them to keep the air out after they're opened.

review/text: I love Popchips. They are a lot different than regular potato chips, but they are quite good. Sea Salt and Vinegar and Chili Lime are my two favorite flavors, and I'd like to try Parmesan Garlic one day (they don't seem to be sold in my area for some reason). Popchips are lower in calories and fat than most regular potato chips, which makes them a healthier alternative when you're looking for something crunchy to snack on. I like to take them to movies (in those rare theatres that don't have 'no outside food' signs) to eat in lieu of butter-laden popcorn. If you're on the fence about buying these, I would recommend trying a small bag to see if you like them before buying one of these big multi-pack deals. I've seen them at a lot of grocery stores--that's where I buy mine. They really are quite different from regular potato chips, but they're tasty and definitely worth trying.

review/summary: Not exactly like traditional potato chips, but a great substitute
review/text: One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips.  I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next.

review/summary: Holy SALT, Batman!
review/text: We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a "healthier" alternative to regular chips.  I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their "original" flavor...I can't imagine what the "Salt & Pepper" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a "healthy" alternative to chips.

review/summary: Sweet Potato Popchip Goodness!
review/text: As a kid, I scarfed bags of the Calbee Sweet Potato chips that my mom would pick up at the local Asian market. As my tastes refined in adulthood, I was less inclined to buy bags of those chips that resembled styrofoam even if I still craved their sugary sweet and salty flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips Sweet Potato chips are the adult version of the snack I grew up with. There's a delicious sweet and salty mix in every bite.  The chip is light and airy, without resembling a foamy rice cake and the deep orange hue is the color of a perfectly roasted sweet potato.<br /><br />I've purchased a number of sweet potato chips from Amazon in the past (Both the "Terra" & "Food Should Taste Good" chips) which have all been good, but they didn't play up the sweet and salty combo quite as much as I'd like. The Terra chips are more like simple sliced sweet potatoes, oven dried and turned into chips; the Food Should Taste Good chips are like yummy, sweet potato flavored, salty tortilla chips; and these Pop Chips sweet potato chips are, well... sweet potato pop chips.  If you've never had a pop chip before, the weight of an individual chip probably most resembles Baked Lays - but with a puckered, air-puffed texture.<br /><br />There are 100 calories per bag.  24 bags come nicely packed in a box that you can tear open for a neat display in your pantry.  I've purchased bagged chips online a number of times and have received packages where the chips were thrown into a box which was thrown into an Amazon box for shipping so by the time they got to me, all the chips were broken.  Not so with this packaging, they're tightly packed so the the bags don't shift around much in shipping and the few bags we've already eaten have had no more broken chips than what we'd get from picking up a bag in the store.<br /><br />Happy snacking!

I found that eating them once in a while was not a big deal, but eating them frequently truly was/is a problem for me.  They taste GOOD, but be careful if you have food allergies.  Just sayin'...

review/summary: Decent
review/text: These have a great crunch and it's great that it's low fat. However, it's way too salty. 280mg per serving is more than twice the amount of regular flavor chips like Lays. The cheddar and sour cream and onion flavor is delicious but also way too salty and too much sodium for my taste buds or health.

review/summary: Salt and Vinegar addict
review/text: I'm not particularly health conscious, but when the general store on campus only had salt and vinegar (my favorite chip flavor) in the popchips brand, I figured I'd give these a try. To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. The texture, which is between a chip and a rice cake, is a bit thicker than usual but has a very satisfying crunch. It also helps the chips to keep from crumbling too easily. The sea salt and vinegar flavor is the perfect combination of salty and tangy, and while these are quite filling, I don't fill sick after I binge on a whole bag the way I would with ordinary chips. I never liked baked chips much (the texture was just off for me) but I think I might actually prefer these to ordinary potato chips.

review/text: These popchips both taste and smell horrible. I was very let down as I enjoy most if not all the various flavors that popchips have to offer... besides this flavor. The smell is actually so awful that it kills it from the start. If you could manage to eat them after that, well good on you. As for me I am dissatisfied with this flavor in specific. I would still recommend popchips as a whole.

Imagine my dismay when I thought the best of both worlds (sweet potato chips ) ended up tasting not much like either of those things. I ate three bags on different days and on an empty stomach just to make sure I wasn't mistaken. Not even my pit bull would touch these (he's a bit of a snob though). These just sit on the cupboard (on death-row) awaiting their expiration date .

review/summary: Once you've got the texture down, good stuff.
review/text: (Three times I've tried to post a review of these and it never goes through... forgive my abruptness.)<br /><br />Popchips? As in, potato chips puffed like popcorn? You got it, bub. Surprising lightness to them--much more so than expected, which allows the taste of the toppings (in this case, chili lime) to seem supercharged. This can be a good thing or not, depending on how sensitive your tongue is. Also, the texture is passing strange at first. Takes a bit of getting used to, but once you're used to it, you'll be popping these like, well, popcorn.

review/text: But healthier than most of the other snacks I cram into my mouth(and that's gotta be worth something right?).  They taste good too!  Kinda sweet, kinda salty.  They're made with sweet potatoes so it makes sense.  Another interesting Popchips feature is that they are "popped"(hence the name, again, makes sense) rather than fried or baked... gives it an oriental rice snack kind of consistency.  All in all very pleased with these, give them a try for yourself, whether a health nut or not(a .8 oz bag of these is about 1/3rd the fat and half the rest of the nutrition facts numbers of a full oz of Lays for the record).

review/text: We've re-ordered the original potato Popchips several times since we first tried them.  They are perfect for snackers who crave salty crunchy things more than sweets.  There's only 100 calories per bag and you actually get enough to feel satisfied.  We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.  They would make great crunchy toppings in recipes as opposed to breadcrumbs though I haven't tried anything beyond slipping a few onto my turkey sandwiches.  (Right, like you've never done it.)

When I tried the original popchips, I was surprised by how good the taste and texture was, so I bought this in bulk, thinking it would be excellent because of the company and because I love sweet potatoes of course.<br />I was wrong.<br /><br />For some reason, the sweet potato chip they've created tastes like cardboard despite having the same texture (cross between rice cake and chip), added with a dash of salt. That's it. I can't describe it any other way than a "bland blah taste with salt"<br /><br />I wish I had gotten the parmesean garlic or the original instead.

review/summary: Super light, quite tasty, overpriced
review/text: We enjoyed these, as they have a light taste unencumbered by heavy oils and the byproducts of frying. No doubt they're much healthier than your standard potato chips, though I will say that Terra's sweet potato chips blow these away for taste, but then they're fried.<br /><br />The main issue here is value. These chips weigh about half what a bag of good chips cost, for the same money. Healthy or not, there needs to be some value, and at a buck for well under an ounce, I'm not sure these have that; I need to eat two bags to feel like I've had a snack. If you only need a tiny bit of something to make you feel full, then this might be perfect, though.<br /><br />But if you want to crunch a lot, don't want fried food, and prefer the sensation of eating a lot to actually eating a lot (dieters!), this would be a fine snack, and a unique taste.

review/summary: If you enjoy sweet potatoes, you'll enjoy these
review/text: I really enjoy sweet potato chips, sweet potato fries, baked sweet potatoes, etc., so I was eager to try these Popchips.  They did not disappoint!  The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness - very tasty!  Just the right amount of light crunch, more like popcorn.<br /><br />At 100 calories per bag, these fit right into my eating plan that allows two 100-150 calorie snacks per day.  That made me extra happy!  There are plenty in the bag, too, unlike the small servings usually found in low-calorie snack packs.<br /><br />I shared these with a friend who came over one afternoon, since she also professed a love of sweet potatoes.  She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.  I should also mention that they are not fans of sweet potatoes, and did not care for these either.  That's ok - more for me!

review/summary: Surprisingly delicious!
review/text: Wow, these are really good!  At first, I didn't understand "Popchips", and I was actually expecting something like regular fried potato chips, only made from sweet potatos.  The Popchips are very different from that!<br /><br />These contain rice flour as well as sweet potatos, and they are kind of air-popped, very light like popcorn.  Texture-wise, they remind me of "Munchos" only lighter and without the oily feel and taste.  Remember Munchos?  These are WAY better.<br /><br />Next thing - the flavor from the sweet potatos is YUMMY!  I know when I first read "rice flour" in the ingredients, I was thinking those cardboard-like rice cakes.  The sweet potato completely takes away any blandness or boringness and adds good taste.  And there is just a touch of salt - just enough to bring out the YUM without overdoing it.<br /><br />Finally, the package size.  When I saw "0.8 ounce", I expected that I would want two, three, or even four bags of these at a time.  Nope - one bag is a good snack!  Not that 0.8 is a big bag, or "filling" or anything like that, but the bag is just the right size, which is a very pleasant surpise to me!  I finish the last chips, like the last of the salt from my fingers, and I feel satisfied - like, wow, that was tasty and just right!  At Amazon's prices, I believe I will be buying these regularly!

I personally dont like sour chips much but these werent too bad in that sense. The chili is quite spicy though. It worth a try unless you really hate spicy chips or sour chips.

review/text: I am glad I got a whole case of these, simple because, after the first bag (keep in mind, these are small single serving bags), I was not impressed, and the sweet potato flavor overwhelmed me, but after eating my second bag, I liked them, a lot!<br /><br />  They are a little salty, but still sweet, and they are a bit akin to the chip version of a baked sweet potato with some butter and maple syrup, or at least that's how they tasted to me after getting over the initial reaction anyway!<br /><br />  My husband ended up eating the majority of them, not because I didn't want to eat them, but because he liked them so much!  It took little over a week for him to eat 2/3 of the box...  ;P  Me eating a bag like every other day, not realizing my supply was rapidly diminishing....<br /><br />  Needless to say, I will absolutely be buying myself a case of these in the very near future!  A great snack, and a wonderful change to the normal pop chips!  :D<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

review/text: SWEET POTATO<br />Pros:<br />- Amazing Taste<br />- Good packaging, almost no chips ever broken, all full shape.<br />- Great nutrition for such a tasty chip (hardly any salt)<br />- Perfect serving in the bag<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Hard to open the bag<br /><br />These chips are now my favorite brand, especially these sweet potato ones.  Since the order comes in a big "retail box" that comes with a count of 24, i gave them to out to friends and coworkers.  EVERY SINGLE PERSON was blown away by the taste.  Ironically, every person also commented on how hard it was to open the actual package. :)  Now the next dilemma is trying to decide... should i buy the sweet potato ones since they were so good, or try another flavor.<br /><br />For the current asking price, it is actually cheaper than buying other branded chips at the store.  Once again, these things blew my mind in that chips could be so good.

review/summary: It's not fried!
review/text: I am on a restricted diet, so these popchips was something I was eager to try.  I am always on the lookout for healthy alternatives to snacking - these were neither fried nor baked (although I will gladly eat a baked chip over a fried potato chip) - popped chips... they reminded me somewhat of Pringles, except the salt content was much lower and not that greasy either.  And, using sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes caught my eye as well.<br /><br />I loved these popchips.  They are slightly sweet and definitely quenches my need for a snack in the middle of the day.  I've seen these at my local Sprouts (not just in sweet potato flavor but other choices as well) and recommend them.  I think it's wonderful to see different types of alternative ways to healthy snacking available to the consumer.

review/summary: Mixed reviews from my family
review/text: Let me start by saying that I am not a sweet potato fan, however, my daughter and husband are, and since we are always looking for healthier snacks, this looked like a good option. There are only 3 grams of fat in a .8 oz snack bag, so they are much better for you then regular chips and if I remember correctly, are even healthier than the regular potato popchips. Personally, I thought the chips were just OK, but my daughter and husband love them, so I averaged out our reviews to end up with 4 stars.<br /><br />When I first bit into a chip I found it intensely sweet but then quickly I tasted the salt and it formed a nice balance, though after eating several I did find them more sweet than salty overall. They are really very light and not at all greasy. If you are a fan of sweet potatoes, you will probably like these chips. If sweet potatoes aren't your thing, these probably won't sway you (they didn't for me).

review/summary: its okay
review/text: i dont get the big deal. First of all they are not nearly as delicious as regular chips so they dont even satisfy the same chip craving in me. They taste okay but slightly carboardy styrofoamy - i.e qualities that you do NOT want in a chip

review/summary: Insanely yummy
review/text: My husband and I agree, these have got to be the best chips ever! Delightful texture, toasty sweet potato flavor, just the right combination of salt and sweet. We're converts!
