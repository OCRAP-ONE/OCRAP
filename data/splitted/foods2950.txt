review/summary: too sweet
review/text: Product site says that it is "kid tested" & approved (probably because of the added sugar). I get more of a sweet flavor than a meat taste. Dried Cranberries have added sugar as is normal w/ cranberries. Glad it is All Natural (sugar tho?) but definitely too sweet for me. I was hoping for more of a meat flavor - not there. Wont be ordering again. A nice meal/snack but I feel very overpriced. May be true to traditional Pemican recipe, maybe my expectations were wrong.

review/summary: Superior to the competition
review/text: Earlier this year I bought a case of the Hormel real bacon bits from Amazon, and decided to try the Oscar Meyer this time.  This brand has a noticeably more natural bacon flavor, and a softer texture. The actual cost per ounce vs. the Hormel seems to be slightly higher, but is worth the premium.

review/text: I'd used soy-derived bacon bits and happened to notice this product on Amazon. They're great! Ideal on a salad, the texture is agreeable and the flavor is very good, not too strong. Colorful. Very convenient. I'll definitely use these real bacon bits instead of fake bacon bits from now on.

review/text: I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FSISY6">Oscar Mayer Real Bacon Bits</a> in a lot of my cooking. I'll add it to ground beef for use in hamburgers or meatloaf, to my potato salad for extra flavor, fry up in butter and toss with fresh steamed green beans, as a topping on homemade pizza, on baked potatoes, etc. The options are endless!<br /><br />Usually I buy this in my local grocery store for around $2 a pouch, but recently Amazon offered a coupon and combined with Subscribe & Save I got a case for just over $1 a pouch which was a great deal for me.

review/summary: Bacon, not dried ham
review/text: Don't be fooled by other brands that claim to be bacon (especially "reduced-fat bacon") - when you read the ingredients, you'll find those products are usually dehydrated ham chips.  This product is 100% real BACON, which means you can use it almost anywhere real strips of bacon can be used, without all the extra cooking, grease, and mess.  In addition to salads, I use Oscar Mayer Bacon Bits on sandwiches like turkey/bacon/Swiss and grilled cheese.  Or it's a quick way to have that bacon cheeseburger.  And of course, it's an easy addition to baked or fresh-mashed potatoes along with some shredded cheddar.<br /><br />I've uploaded a picture of the current packaging, since it has changed from Amazon's main image.<br /><br />When you want your bacon bits to be made from actual bacon, don't look elsewhere - get Oscar Mayer and know you've purchased the real thing.

review/summary: Half Caff
review/text: A real dissapointment. With my regular brewer I have made my own half caff by blending a Starbucks caff and decaf for years. When I got my Keruig I thought this half-caff product would be the best answer for me, but it isn't. This tastes like a mixture of weak coffee and dishwater. Why Green Mountain put this out is a mystery. Green Mountain has a good caff coffee called Dark Magic and a good decaf coffee called Dark Magic Decaf. All they would have to do is use half of each of these in a K-cup and they would have an excellent half-caf. I know because I have a 20 ounce mug that I have brewed 9.5 ounces of each of these together and the taste is great. The only explanation for this Green Mountain half-caff product is that they must think that anyone who would buy a half-caf probably doesn't care much about taste, so they can use two cheaper coffees. Half-caff coffee drinkers DO care about taste. Message to Green Mountain: Give us a 50:50 mixture of the Dark Magic caff and Dark Magic decaff coffees, call it Dark Magic Half Caff so people will know what it is,  and deep six this product.

Nothing from this company had been disappointing. This soup only has 120 calories for the entire can so i figured what i lost in calories would also be lost in taste. I was very wrong. It is full of a variety of veggies and a nice flavor. I add some dried oregano just to top it off. I haven't purchased this off amazon but i know it is much cheaper here than in stores. I plan on ordering this off here when i move so i have more room for all these cans. I highly recommend this to anyone. It is a healthy vegan-friendly organic soup.

I am not a big fan of tomato soup, but it's a light broth....it's not a heavy, thick soup, it's a tad bit sour..but it's tomato! I really enjoyed it. There was plenty of vegetables inside and it tasted very hearty and healthy. The sodium is high, but I don't care! I call it flavor! Very delicious and I easily ate a whole can by myself. Hands down the best canned soup I've tasted.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it's a tad sour, I still love it though! And because it's really expensive, Over $2 a can at my local Whole Foods.

review/summary: Pretty good, needs improvement
review/text: I only buy organic, and decided to try a case based on the positive reviews. Here is my take on the soup:<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />1. Good ingredients: organic vegies, no MSG, no hydrogenated oil or chemicals<br />2. Good amount of vegetables (unlike many soups that are mostly broth)<br />3. Low in salt, fat-free (you can add either, but can't take it away)<br /><br />The cons:<br />1. Mushy overcooked veggies<br />2. Not much seasoning<br />3. No pop-top on the can (a minor gripe, but really I can't remember the last time I had to use a can opener for soup, making this soup less of an option to take to work)<br /><br />Here is what I did to take this basic soup up a notch: added a bit of organic olive oil, a little oregano, and a dash of cayenne. This makes the soup much tastier. Sometimes I add shredded cheddar or Parmesan cheese.<br />Still, I can't fix the mushy veggies. It isn't enough of a convenience, with no pop-top and the doctoring required, so I'll stick to making my own with canned organic seasoned tomatoes, organic broth, and mixed veggies. Better soup, easy to make, more economical. Sorry Amy.

review/summary: nutritious but needs something more
review/text: I miss the old Walnut Acres soups, which were hearty with hand cut vegetables mixed with beans and meat.  I particularly miss the Scotch broth, which had barley and lamb with vegetables.<br /><br />I can use Amy's soups by adding cans of beans and using fat from meat to fill out the flavor.  For example, if I cook some Italian sausage, I remove some of the fat and then pour the soup in the pan with the scrappings of flavor from the sausage and some of the fat from the sausage.  I may then add a can of organic beans - garbanzos, pinto, kidney, white.  I may also add some frozen okra or spinach to give the soup some heartier vegetables instead of the small ones in the can of soup.<br /><br />I can recommend her soups as a kind of base, and that provides a saving of time and provides some organic nutrition.

It works equally well at full-strength.<br /><br />I just wish Arizona would market more non-tea mixes.

The first day he had it, he liked it but then he started itching a lot and then refused to eat it.  I gave it to him for another week anyway mixed with his regular food which is taste of the wild, but the itching persisted. I guess his body can't handle it, and he's not allergic to the proteins because he is currently eating all the same proteins in his regular food and treats. He is back on his old brand and is now fine, no more crazy itching.

review/summary: Good Cat Food Without Smelly Cans
review/text: What self-respecting cat isn't a picky eater?  I've never met any.  My cat likes Whiskas Choice Cut foods mainly for the gravy, and sometimes for the meat.  Omar the Magnificent and Wonderful likes both  the Beef in Gravy or Tuna.  Truth be told his dry crunchie is really his go-to choice, but he's that way with all prepared moist foods.  If you ask him his true five-star preference is meat caught fresh in  the garden.  Let's skip the details, you don't want to know.... Let's just say that Omar (M&W) is on the job!<br /><br />I personally prefer Whiskas foods in pouches because Omar is OK with allowing any remaining food to be left in pouch when stored in fridge, rather than having to transfer it from a can to a glass container.  (Come on you all have cats that expect you to do this!)  Pouches are easy to dispose of too.  Just rinse and trash.  You aren't messing with storing smelling cans and trips to the recycling center.

review/text: Both my cats love Whiskas in any flavor.  My female cat, Sophie, is usually the one that takes little bits until it is gone.  When she hears me tearing the Whiskas Pouches, she flys into the kitchen and waits patiently for her food.  She never lifts her head up from the bowl until every piece is gone.  She will then sit by her brother, Samson, to get more food if he leaves.  After he gulps his food down and see's his Sissy waiting for some of his, he will tease her by taking one piece of his food out with his paw, look at her and when she trys to take it away he puts his paw on it and scoops it into his mouth. i can always count on empty bowls when I buy Whiskas.  The price at Amazon is more reasonable than the grocery store.

review/summary: Tasty food for a picky cat
review/text: Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: "She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years."<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether.

review/text: My cat will eat NOTHING but Whiskas Beef in Gravy cat food. Being able to order and receive it through the mail has been a blessing. I get it for my mom because she cannot drive to the store because of her health issues. Its great not to have the extra burden of getting cat food. Her cat is her companion through hard times.

review/summary: My cats come running
review/text: I have two big cats that are over 15 lbs. each.  For breakfast, I give them each a packet of Whiskas Choice cuts.  They inhale the food in about 2-3 minutes.  This food doesn't have that catfood smell that most canned foods have.  There's a lot of gravy so the price is pretty high considering the amount of liquid.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KIB8K">Friskies Cat Food Favorites, 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a> are more expensive and very similar.<br /><br />I have these on Subscribe and Save so the price is pretty good.  Based upon my cats reaction, they really like this food.

review/summary: Used for Pancakes
review/text: There's a recipe for pancakes on the back of all the muffin mixes. Personally, I don't like real fruit in/on my pancakes, so this is perfect. It's also a small portion, 5-8 pancakes, depending on how big you make them. This is perfect for me during the week; I make one batch, refrigerate, and I have fresh, non-frozen pancakes for about 3 breakfasts.<br />I did notice the recipe on the back can be a little runny if followed exactly, so a little flour may need to be added to the mix to thicken it up or a little less milk than recommended.

review/summary: Hits the spot!
review/text: These are spicy korean style instant noodles.  I usually buy Nong Shim, but decided to give these a try and they are as delicious.  The flavour is much cleaner, not as complex.  The ingredients are all natural except for the MSG, which is better than a lot of ready to eat foods out there. Although its far from healthy, in moderation its a nice quick treat.  To avoid the excess sodium and msg, i don't drink the soup. Whatever soup that clings to the noodles is satisfying enough for me.<br /><br />Ingredient List: Noodle -- wheat flour potato starch, palm oil, salt, onion paste, corn flour.  Soup -- Salt, MSG, Red Pepper, Soy sauce, garlic powder, bean paste powder, soy bean powder, onion powder, black pepper, cabbage, salted shrimp, onion, radish.

She had dry skin, eye problems, hair loss and chronic skin sores with frequent vet trips and constant antibiotic spray with no results. Walking through Target looked up and saw dog food display. Brain flash said try new food. Bought Purina One. Within 2 weeks noticed marked improvement. Searched web and found site where owners rated food. Science Diet rated "F". Purina One better but rated "C". Natural Balance Ultra Premium rated A+. Bought first bag 3 years ago. Coat now thick and glossy, eyes clear, skin clear with no lesions after first few weeks, feels great and very energetic and playful where used to be in pain and acted like old dog. GREAT FOOD, Dog loves it, made from good stuff. Can't say too much good for this product.

review/text: I first learned of this food when I went to Petco to check out the Blue Buffalo brand.  One of our dogs has had some stomach issues and had been on a prescribed diet that was expensive.  We were recommended to try Natural Balance.  Our dogs love it.  We have four small breed dogs, and our chihuahua with the stomach problems has no problems eating it.  No messes, gas or anything.  We would highly recommend it for picky dogs also.  Also, the price on amazon is almost seven dollars cheaper than in store, with having free two day shipping...you can't beat that, especially with gas prices being so high.

review/summary: Great dog food
review/text: My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you're actually getting more "bang for your buck" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... I'm sold!!

review/summary: Balance indeed!!
review/text: I first started using this food in April when I got my Boston Terrier puppy.  The breeder staunchly preached at me about following a natural feeding regiment that took longer to prepare and cost more than feeding my family did, so I went online to look for some alternatives.  I ran across this food and not only was it highly recommended, it is "nutritionally complete" and therefore appropriate for both puppies as well as older dogs.  The biggest selling point however was that I could also pick it up at my local PETCO, so it did not have to be purchased online.<br /><br />My Boston puppy loves it, and she does not ever have any of the stinky, stinky farts that are so common to Bostons and Bulldogs.  Its also a plus that my older Jack Russell Terrier loves it, and it has cleared up her skin issues and scratching.  This food is great for all dogs, and is a total steal on Amazon with cheap overnight shipping!

review/summary: Cured his itching and hair loss!
review/text: My beagle/jack russell mix had terrible skin problems. He sleeps with me and was keeping us both up with his scratching all night. He started losing hair and actually causing bloody patches on his underarms and belly. I was giving him frequent baths and rubdowns with a baking soda paste which did give him some relief. After reading the reviews here though, I decided to try Natural Balance. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CFN92">Natural Balance Ultra Premium Small Bite Formula Food, 12.5-Pound Bag</a> I ordered my first 12.5 lb. bag a few weeks ago. He is about 3/4 of the way through the bag and totally cured. No more itching, scatching or bleeding. We couldn't be happier! So worth the extra cost because I was spending a fortune on medicine, treatments and office visits. Plus, he had always been a picky eater. I gave away so much food because after a few meals, he would stop eating it. Not so with Natural Balance! He eats every bite. He loves it. Thanks Amazon.com, for your customer reviews or I never would have thought to try Natural Balance for Mac's itching problems.

review/summary: Keep going back to this food!
review/text: As a mom of a Min Pin and a Chihuahua we have tried other dog food brands but have always gone back to the Natural Balance Ultra Premium.  For the quality of the food, the price of Amazon cannot be beat.  Plus free shipping to your door and no sales tax!?!  This is a grain free, limited ingredient diet.  My Chihuahua is the picky one and my Min Pin has digestion issues.  When I have switched to more expensive, higher protein foods, my Min Pin ends up w/a runny stool.  While I do also give him a probiotic/enzyme supplement with his daily meal, this is one of the only foods that his stool has consistently been formed, solid and not runny or the opposite hard and caused constipation.  My Chihuahua has no issues w/this food and readily eats it plain.  While all dog foods seem to be at the mercy of recalls at one point or another, Natural Balance seems to not be the subject of very many.  My mother fed her lab Natural Balance Duck and Potato for 12 years and never once had an issue w/the food.<br /><br />The first ingredient in this food is Chicken, whole chicken, not "meal".  The other meats in this formula are Lamb meal and Duck meal, ingredient numbers 3 and 9 respectively.  Rice, oatmeal, barley and potatoes make up the carbohydrate portion so there are no grains.  I also appreciate the fact that for a while the Duck meal was eliminated from the formula because Natural Balance was no longer able to find a supplier of the duck that met their quality standards.  After 18 months, they found a new supplier and returned the duck to the formula.  Just the fact that they are forthright w/this fact and explain that they could not find a quality source (even if it was due to the fact that their previous supplier wanted more money for the same product, which I don't know I am just speculating that is why they dropped it initially) speaks to their ethics.  Then the fact that they searched and found a new, quality source of the duck without raising the price of the product also speaks volumes to their dedication to the customer.  Thank you Natural Balance!  We are happy customers here!

Being intimidated by the choices (like buying toothpaste in the supermarket) I relied on reviews by others who seemed to have researched this subject more than I.

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE This Food
review/text: Due to extremely poor planning on my part, I did not have enough of their prior food on hand for a good transition feeding, i.e., mixing the 2 foods together for a few days.  However, both foods are a chicken rice formula, so I wasn't too worried.  The change was made as one of my 2 Miniature Poodles (Mr FUSSY) was completely tired of his old food after almost 2 years!!<br /><br />Today I put down a bowl for each of the 2 dogs, mixed with a bit of their canned (Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover).  Let me back up--"Mr Fussy" was actually dancing around while I was scooping!!  A FIRST!  Both dogs, the male and the female ate until their bowls were empty--and then licked them CLEAN---looked like I forgot to feed them!!!<br /><br />I just LOVE the small size kibble---it is absolutely perfect for them.  Even when I give them a cookie, I break them in half or they (neither one) will take it! They SNARFED this food.<br /><br />We are a happy family!!

review/summary: 16 Paws Up!
review/text: We have 2 dogs and 2 cats (hence the 16 paws), and everyone is on Natural Balance. When we adopted our cats a year and a half ago, they were pretty young and we wanted to start them off right. They've been on NB ever since and have done fantastically. When we rescued an overweight Pomeranian and a scrawny poodle/terrier mix earlier this year we tried several brands, but I figured since the cats loved NB, and the dogs seemed to have a thing for the cats' food, it was a logical next step to give the canine NB a shot. I went to my local pet store and picked up the $3 sample pack, and after one day I knew it was a hit. Mickey (the Pom) has started to slim down and I can actually feel her ribs again. Mollie (the mix) has filled out and gained more muscle. Mickey also has a very sensitive stomach, so this is perfect for her. Their coats have never been better and their energy level is amazing. They're both 3 1/2 years old and they act like puppies chasing each other around.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good-quality dog food at a reasonable price for what's in it, this is it.

review/summary: best small dog breed food ever
review/text: My dog likes it eats it and poops well and doesn't get fat and it smells good too. Energy level is good and has reflected on dog's health as good food to give to my dog. Has high quality source meat. rice blend is better than oat for dog digestive i think.

review/summary: Amazing healthy flour
review/text: Do some of your own research on sprouted flours and you'll find that your body treats it more like a vegetable than a grain.  The carb content is fairly high,  but the glycemic effect doesn't seem to be even close to regular wheat flour and it seems to be much easier to bake/cook with than regular wheat flour.  My wife makes all kinds of stuff with it now.  Pizza crust, cinnamon rolls (with whey low as a sweetener,  another miracle product), she even makes bread in a nice panasonic bread maker.  One of the keys for her is that she sifts it in every recipe.  Another miracle product we use is Extra Virgin coconut oil.  These are all more expensive but being unhealthy is way more costly in the long run.  Back to the flour,  man does this taste good.  She experiments with recipes,  but everything has been good and much healthier.  Some more things that are amazing with this flour are coffee cakes, did I mention the awesome pizza crust with permasan cheese in it?, she actually makes a chocolate cake that seems evil and is so good,  but is NOT fattening or unhealty! (substitute EVCO for some of the butter)  I am no nutritionist, but I know what the scale says and after we make stuff with this flour,  whey low sugar,(look it up online,  its AMAZING and does exactly what they say) and EVCO,  I feel better,  have better skin and have more energy and can eat freaking chocolate CAKE.  The scale and the way I feel are enough for me.  These three products are phenominal and can change the way you and your family eat.  We extensively researched it before using it and are here to say it does what its supposed to and with some work you can make some amazing healthy stuff as well.  And,  our cinnamon rolls have amazing icing made with why low powdered sugar with pecans in them!  I didn't even start about the ice cream with coconut milk,  heavy cream and whey low.  Amazing stuff and no weight gains!  (still have to have some moderation,  but wow!)
