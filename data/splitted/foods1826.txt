review/summary: Awfully small
review/text: I buy this syrup all the time when I'm down south, but forgot to bring it with me to Wisconsin. I ordered this expecting to get the usual size I buy from the grocery store, but this teeny thing showed up. The photo is deceiving - it doesn't state any where but the label that it is only 12 oz. I assumed since it was $8.99, that I'd get more! I think with shipping I paid over $15! I learned my lesson.<br />I did get it in a timely manner at least (but its all gone!)

review/summary: A first taste of fun!
review/text: I first tasted Wonka Bottle caps in the little fun size package(three or four caps per little pack) just this Hallowe'en...and I am hooked.  Sweet, not too tart, they linger in the mouth like the best candies I know(among them Fireballs, Tootsie Rolls, Hershey's Kisses...you know what I mean--!), and they have me scrambling to find a larger size of the stuff.  Which, of course, let me to Amazon...you can find almost anything here!<br />So here I am an older 'young person'( I'm 58, I'll have you know--LOL) looking to find more of these little bits of fun.<br />What more can I say?  Wonka delivered!

review/summary: I love cinnamon!
review/text: This product was my first introduction to freshly ground cinnamon.  I prefer the taste of Drogheria & Alimentari freshly ground cinnamon on frozen yogurt or oatmeal.  It does grate out bigger pieces of cinnamon, not finely ground like I was used to seeing.  I found the flavor of the cinnamon to be better than grocery store cinnamon but not as good as Dean & Deluca cinnamon.<br /><br />I don't like that the cover just sits on the top, it doesn't affix in any way.  That is, the cap won't stay on by itself when the bottle is not in an upright position.  (What is with that, anyway?)<br /><br />The flavor of the cinnamon is good but not great.  In my opinion, the McCormick Cinnamon Grinder is better.  The flavor of the McCormick Cinnamon Grinder cinnamon is richer; the cap stays on; and the ground cinnamon is finer but not completely fine.<br /><br />So I recommend the Drogheria & Alimentari Cinnamon Grinder only if the McCormick Cinnamon Grinder is not available.

In addition, the company offers other types of spice grinders, and I'm considering those as well. Thanks!

review/summary: Very good
review/text: Here is the thing: I have had maybe 6 different Italian made/branded pasta's. This is pretty expensive one with price avg 3x the normal USA brands. Is there a difference between this and other? Is there a difference between this and organic? I can't tell either... I tried it 3 different ways: in Alfredo sauce, in red gravy with meatballs and tossed with olive oil, garlic, and olives. I simply cannot tell the difference in taste/flavor from Prince or this. Maybe it's a good thing then? And, given a choice, I would chose this, but likely not at the 3x price tag. There is 1 thing I did notice: this pasta and other Italian made pasta's are coated is something starchy? I assume it's to help in drying process? I am not sure. Also, they seem to be slightly thicker. It's hard to judge, but maybe 1mm thickness difference does make a difference?<br /><br />Anyway, good product, tasted good, just not sure if it justifies the price tag.

review/summary: Delicious! Amazing! Worth the dollas!
review/text: I bought this salt after listening to a podcast of the Splendid Table with a man named Mark Bitterman. Yes, Bitterman (not Bittman). He wrote an entire book on salt <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580082629">Salted: A Manifesto on the World's Most Essential Mineral, with Recipes</a> and recommended this salt as an everyday "table salt" alternative. It may not be the most appealing color, but it was what I would expect of a product called "Gray Sea Salt" (or Sel Gris, if you know some French).<br />As someone who has thus far in life considered Kosher Salt the "fancy" alternative, I now know where I will continually spend a little extra for a lot more. I've put this on everything, from roasted chicken to potato soup. If you rub together your fingers as you sprinkle, you can make a fine coating, but it's perfect in soups because it has such a high-moisture content that it sticks to its own bag. If you are a die-hard iodized table salt fan, this is not the salt for you. It tastes and looks substantially different from your everyday grocery-store salt, and behaves very differently when used in cooking. If you are baking, and the recipe calls for "salt," you may want to taste before you stick it in the oven, and start small, and add as you taste. The moisture content may also alter certain more sensitive recipes, so you it's best to plan ahead if you wish to experiment.<br />The flavor difference is truly indescribable. I think I would prefer to use this in savory dishes, as that is the flavor palette it gave me, but it may also work well in desserts or on fruits that like salt.<br />I encourage you to do a taste test as soon as you get it home against your regular table salt. You will immediately thank me, other enthusiastic reviewers, Gu&eacute;rande, France, and the Bay of Biscay.

review/text: The granules are larger than Kosher salt so when I sprinkled it on a salad, I got these intermittent explosions of salt - very nice.  I don't use it in cooked dishes [common salt will do], just a sprinkle on whatever needs to have fresh salt. I approve of the extra minerals also.  Amazon's price is far cheaper than what Food Network entertainers are asking on their websites.

review/summary: One of life's luxuries that you can actually afford everyday!
review/text: If you are like me, then you grew up thinking that there were only two types of salt in the entire world.<br /><br />The first was heavy, coarse, came in 50lb bags, and tasted awful...but it was great for melting thick ice off stairs, sidewalks and driveways in the winter...and for some reason you had to put it into your ice cream maker in the summer.<br /><br />The second always came out of a round blue cardboard container, tasting only marginally better...and although you knew it was "iodized"...that to you meant something along the same lines as your water being "fluoridated"...which is to say that you really didn't know what it meant, but there was a vague notion somewhere in the back of your mind that it was good for you.<br /><br />Well now there is a third kind of salt in my world...and grinding just a tiny bit of it onto anything edible makes it taste amazing...kind of like slapping your taste-buds awake!<br /><br />Since then of course I looked into all the wonderful health benefits that the trace minerals provide using this natural salt...but the truth of my world is that if it didn't taste amazing...then I wouldn't use it no matter what it did.<br /><br />If I was stranded on a desert island and could only take one thing to eat with me...this would definitely be it...because no matter what else I could scrounge up to eat, this would always make it taste great!

review/summary: Absolutely Awful Cat Food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs." Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

review/summary: Our new staple
review/text: My kids are picky eaters who don't much care for complex dishes and mixed flavors. Since discovering brown jasmine rice I am having far more success getting my kids to eat brown rice. The flavor is milder than other brown rices and the texture more like white rice. This allows me to serve a whole grain at dinner and reduce our consumption of the "evil, white" carbs of potatoes and pasta. This is a wonderful tasting rice and I'm so glad I get get an organic variety from Amazon, as I cannot find an organic type locally. I do wish it had more fiber, but you can't have everything.<br /><br />FYI, since it is a whole grain I do store it in the freezer. I also cook it in a pressure cooker (Kuhn-Rikon) for 15 minutes at full pressure. This way it is just as quick as white rice and we like the texture. I only need a 1.5 to 1 ratio of water to rice in the cooker.

Sometimes after the cooking cycle I add chopped cilantro & a squeeze of lemon, though it is flavorful without any additions.<br /><br />I tried to rinse the rice the first time I cooked it and noticed the water was very clear, so now I don't bother rinsing.  I noticed another reviewer mentioned it isn't necessary.<br /><br />This is the only rice I use now.

review/summary: Is this a whole grain rice?
review/text: Good tasting product - but doesn't seem to be whole grain rice.  This rice simply seems brown - but does not have any fibre (0 g of fibre on the nutrient composition label). This is no fault of the company as they do not advertise it as whole grain rice - but when you read other reviews you think it may be.  I really wish Amazon would post the nutrient profile of the food items they sell like many grocery stores do so you know what it is before the item arrives. Lundberg has a variety of whole grain rices for a similar price and are really tasty (although they take longer to cook because they are whole grain) they have about 3 g of fibre per serving according to the nutrition label.

review/summary: Very tasty brown rice.
review/text: I've been a chef for some twenty years now, and as a fellow chef associate of mine says, "You're always looking for more flavor". I think this rice qualifies. In a word, it is delicious. It's as easy to cook as any brown rice, which of course means it takes longer than bleached rice does (which is fine since bleached rice essentially has no nutritional value whatsoever...I'm willig to wait a little longer to maximize the benefits of the food i eat), but is also easier to keep from over cooking. I use a rice cooker with a brown rice setting, which makes it even easier. Just set the timer and walk away. Anyway, i can report that the flavor of this rice unseasoned is full and wholesome, and mixed in with stuff, and/or seasoned, it really pops. A great, healthy rice at a reasonable price. I love the stuff.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: This is better tasting than most brown rice I've cooked.  Smells very fresh out of the bag.  This case is a lot of rice so unless you eat rice daily you should probably store it in the fridge.  I read that brown rice goes bad faster than white rice because it still has the germ in the kernel.

review/text: I recieved this jerky as a free replacement for another buffalo bills product with I hadn't liked.  They definitely stand behind their products and are very pleasant to deal with.  This jerky has a sweet barbeque flavor, and is quite tender and moist.  Very few pieces have a little gristle; for the most part they are easy to eat.  I agree they could have less salt for my taste, and also for health reasons, but they are quite delicious as they are.  This is the best jerky I have ever had.

Not one of the four dogs I give chews to - two of whom love to chew and aren't picky - found this remotely interesting. It has no texture, no smell, and it doesn't even seem like a natural product. Why would they be drawn to it? I found it weeks later discarded behind their toy basket (where unwanted "treats" go to be discarded by the dogs.) I tried to offer it again, and again, no takers. I was bummed.

I decided to make it into a latte with soy milk and opted to not add sugar so I could get the full taste of the matcha. After less than a minute of whisking, the matcha created a nice blanket of foam. The first sip was heavenly and after adding some agave, the cheesecake flavor popped even more. This has become one of my favorite matchas and I'm excited to mix it with other flavors and make signature flavored cheesecakes.

review/summary: Cheese-less Cheesecake!
review/text: I've heard great, great things about this matcha and I couldn't wait to try it. But real life stepped in and I didn't have the time to give it the attention it deserved, so, well, I had to wait to try. But I wait no more! Today I got to mix up my first frothy cup of cheesecake matcha goodness. I was stuck at the location I hate at work, so I desperately needed a thermos of matcha comfort and boy oh boy was I not let down! This is amazing stuff. Creamy and just that touch of tang found in a good cheesecake....yum. One of my specialities around this time of year is a pumpkin cheesecake....nom. I can't wait to mix this with a touch of Pumpkin Pie matcha and see how they go together.<br /><br />Oh cheesecake, I have missed you desperately. Cream cheese is one of those things I absolutely cannot have or I'll be ill for days, so cheesecake is, unfortunately permanently off my menu. But with a little beauty like this in my tea cupboard, I find I don't mind nearly as much! I want to try mixing this with all of the flavors in the Red Leaf Tea catalogue, and I'm sure every one of them would be delicious!

review/summary: Can't go wrong with cheesecake.
review/text: Cheesecake matcha basically sounds like a dream come true. I'm not sure why I didn't order this with my first order. If I can get matcha that will satisfy my cheesecake craving without all the calories, I am definitely going to try it!<br /><br />I received this with my order of tiramisu and caramel, and although it had the least distinctive smell and flavour, it definitely still had an authentic cheesecakey-ness that was so worth it. I think the best part of this was that it wasn't just matcha that tasted like cheesecake - it tastes like what I imagine matcha-flavoured cheesecake would taste like (I haven't ventured into the world of baking with matcha because I am the only one who would eat it and I really don't need to eat an entire batch of cookies, cheesecake, etc. By myself!).<br /><br />Sweet, but not too sweet, with that little hint of tanginess that you get from cream cheese, this is a perfect after-dinner tea. I am going to make it again and do a better job - I had it iced the first time, and I think that is how I will prefer it, but it wasn't quite cold enough. I took it to work in my timolino and forgot to put ice cubes in!  That will be a necessity next time. I can't wait to mix this with a few other flavours!

review/text: I love this matcha every bit as much as I thought I would. I have tried three flavoured matchas from Red Leaf, and they are quickly becoming my favourite beverages.<br /><br />This particular matcha has a full, creamy flavour and texture. You can almost even taste the cream cheese tang. There's also a bit of cookie-crust going on here, which I love!<br /><br />When I first opened the packet I was delighted with the aroma. It smells sweet and decadent, almost reminded me of matcha ice cream! Must be the sweet creaminess of the cheesecake flavour combined with that familiar, distinctive matcha scent I know and love.<br /><br />This one has become a staple for me, and although there are lots of different flavours I'd love to try, I know I'll always make sure to have some of this on hand. It is so delicious and versatile.

review/summary: Perfection in a cup!
review/text: It has been far too long since I've had some matcha so I decided that tonight would be as good as any to remedy that situation. This cheesecake matcha is seriously smooth and has a very strong aroma that makes me want to double check and make sure there isn't any actual cheesecake somewhere in my kitchen. I've had this matcha several times now and each time this flavor is spot on to a real, creamy cheesecake. You can find out more about this matcha here (and pick up some for yourself!):[...]<br /> Initially, I tried this matcha traditionally in my chawan and it was creamy and rich. I was pleasantly surprised that the color was a vibrant green instead of being muddled by the flavoring. Even though the cheesecake flavor is front and center, it is tempered nicely with a smooth, fresh matcha aftertaste that prevents the flavor from being cloying. The matcha also whisked up quite well with no noticeable clumps and I didn't even sift it!<br /><br /> After the initial success with this matcha, I couldn't wait to try it as a hot cheesecake latte. Although the thought of hot liquid cheesecake is not necessarily my idea of a great treat, I was confident that the quality of Red Leaf Tea's product would not let me down. With a bit of sugar and the addition of warm milk, this latte was so great! I downed it in no time flat and had to make another immediately.<br /><br /> Tonight, I'm having this as a cold iced matcha with a teensy bit of sugar and enough milk to complete the cup. The flavor seems to really pop when prepared this way and I'm certainly wondering how I made it for so many days without drinking this or any other of the great flavors from Red Leaf Tea. A couple of weeks ago I made a delicious matcha cake and I think it would be amazing with this cheesecake flavor as the base! Now to figure out what the next flavor I'll try will be...

review/summary: Dreams really do come true!
review/text: Okay, I was wracking my brain to think of which matcha I had left to review. I actually had to go into my cupboard and sort my Recently Added to figure it out... it was CHEESECAKE! How could I forget?! I've been drinking this glorious Matcha almost every day, not even kidding. I know it'll be the first I run out of and the first I run back to order more of! I might get a tin just for this one, because I know it will be in my cupboard forever. Dear Red Leaf Tea, never stop making matcha!!!! Love, your adoring fans!<br /><br />I have had 2 amazing cheesecakes in my life. One was purchased on a trip to Vancouver from the market on Granville Island. It was tiny. It was expensive. It was amazing! The second was this week from a place called Broadway Cheesecake (something like that) here in Halifax. They have so freaking many kinds of cheesecake, it is crazy! 8 bucks a piece, but the pieces are HUGE. Why am I telling you this? Because this matcha trumps them. It puts the power of cheesecake into my little hands, adds green tea powder to make it amazing, and tastes like heaven on earth!<br /><br />That may seem a little dramatic, but it's the only way I know how to truly show how much I appreciate this matcha in my cupboard. The taste is tangy, thick and a bit sweet. If you add sugar it has the decadence of a perfect cream cheese icing. If you add milk (I tried 2%, almond and vanilla soy) it's a slice from a fine bakery (or cheesecake from home, arguably the best kind!). If you drink it hot - it's fresh from the oven! Iced? It's a perfectly chilled and dense New York piece from the fridge. I could go on, but I guess what I'm trying to say is: Any way you slice it, this Cheesecake Matcha is the best of the best - it has the power to turn my crappy tired morning into an awesome day. Just sayin'.<br /><br />One of the best features of this flavour (and many of the other dessert matchas) is that you get the delicious taste of a rich cheesecake without the tummy-ache and super full and heavy feeling. I won't say without the "guilt" because I am highly against self shaming, especially in the food department. With that in mind - this tea doesn't completely replace a cheesecake. I'll still eat my fair share of cheesecake! What this tea DOES do is let you have cheesecake every day - even if your tummy is full or your wallet is empty! THAT my friends, is the magic of matcha :D<br /><br />Thanks for reading this ramble. I'm kind of passionate, can you tell? ;)

review/text: Another winner from Red Leaf Tea!<br /><br />The smell of the this particular matcha is tangy and slightly sweet, even though there's no sugar added to the flavoring.  I prepared this my usual way - cold latte style.  Two ounces of warmed water with a teaspoon of matcha and a half teaspoon of super-fine sugar - wisk until blended.  I didn't try sifting the matcha this time, and it frothed up very nicely without any clumping.  Six ounces of cold, creamy whole milk and the taste was so smooth and creamy with a bit of tang - just how I like my cheesecake to be!<br /><br />After my first cup as a cold latte, I went for a second cup  - this time as a warmed, straight matcha.  The tang and creaminess are much less noticable the second time around, but the matcha base is much more prevalent.  As the cup cools, the tangy taste comes to the forefront with the matcha and the creaminess lags behind.  It's kind of like having two very different teas, which is pretty awesome for just buying the one!  A creamy, dessert-like cup of tangy cheesecake with milk/dairy alternative or a green tea with a little tang - it's up to whatever kind of mood you're in!

review/summary: Cheesecake, anyone?  Why, YES please!!!
review/text: I've tried this prepared a couple of different ways now.  The first time I prepared it, I prepared it the way I would most Matcha - in the traditional way in my chawan (tea bowl) and whisking it until smooth and frothy.  It is good that way.  It has a delicious, creamy taste.  Sweet.  Really good, and tasting very much like cheesecake.<br /><br />However, if you really want the FULL cheesecake experience, I recommend drinking this one as a latte, using warmed milk instead of water and whisking with a frothing tool instead of the bamboo whisk.  YUM!  The creamier texture and flavor that comes from using milk instead of water is really beneficial to this cheesecake flavored Matcha.  All the flavor remains intact - it is not masked by the milk - and it tastes creamier and richer ... and let's face it, when you want cheesecake, you want that rich, creamy flavor and texture.<br /><br />This cheesecake flavored Matcha is rich, smooth, and sweet, with the distinctive tangy taste of cream cheese and even a hint of buttery pastry.  It makes a delightful pick-me-up for the afternoon, especially if you're craving something a little sweet.  This will help curb those cravings for a fraction of the calories and fat!

review/summary: Like Home made quality cheesecake!!
review/text: This particular matcha tastes EXACTLY like cheesecake and not that fake cheesecake made with inferior "cheesecake" stuffing stuff you can buy pre made in the store but real cheesecake made at home from scratch or from a fine restaurant or bakery!<br /><br />It is not overly sweet either which I was surprised at because I honestly was expecting something more fake tasting and overly sugary.<br /><br />I was both surprised and pleased when I took my first sip and realized this was the real deal! I still am amazed that Red Leaf Tea can get such excellent flavor from all natural sources into a matcha!<br /><br />This flavor melded perfectly with the green tea base giving it a beautiful slightly sweet and creamy earthy flavor! I imagine it would be insanely good in a white base as well!<br /><br />You can almost taste the crumbly cheesecake crust in this as well as the taste of the filling so you do get that whole cheesecake experience.

review/summary: INSANELY delicious!!!!
review/text: My family and I love Indian food, so when my niece was cooking this up at her house and I got a whiff of it, I had to try it.  OH. MY. GAWD.  YUMMMMMMM!!!!  It's VERY flavorful without being too hot/spicy.  If you want it hotter you can always add some more hot spice to it.<br /><br />I use my BIG skillet, sautee a bunch of onion in coconut oil to start, then add whatever veggies I have on hand:  squash, greens, green beans, mushrooms, celery, ... you name it, I've put it in there, and it's ALWAYS delicious!  When I'm making enough to have leftovers I'll use 2 jars, but if it's just for the hubby and me I use just one.<br /><br />I generally make it with fish rather than chicken.  I've been using wild-caught cod and it's just marvelous.  Sometimes I serve it over quinoa, but mostly I just serve it as though it were a "fish stew" with the fish & veggies.<br /><br />TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT!!!

review/text: I purchased these at a "local" target for movie snacks. they are pretty good. any lover of teddy grams will enjoy these. the dry marshmallows are reminiscent of the kind in cereal. they have a tiny grove in them so you can "stack them".<br /><br />I strongly recommend them. what I don't recommend is putting them in a bowl and dumping milk on them.<br />it is a horrible idea and creates and unpleasant gritty slurry.

review/summary: PEPPERIDGE FARM GOLDFISH CHOCOLATE GRAHAM CRACKERS(PACK OF 8)
review/text: A delicious great tasting product by Pepperidge Farm that normally cost you $2.49 per bag, sometimes on sale at the supermarket 2 for $4.00, but I picked my Pepperidge Farm Chocolate Graham Goldfish Crackers (Pack Of 8) through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com and shipped free to my home for an awesome price of ONLY $10.63!!! If you can get a deal like this I highly suggest purchasing it right away! If not, no worries and try getting it a little more than my bargain for no more $13.00 in my opinion, seeing as if you were to pay the retail suggested price on bag for $2.49 X 8 = $19.92 would still be a bargain if you look at it this way like I do! Good Luck and happy bargain shopping, ENJOY!!!

review/summary: UNCANNY! Must Buy! Must Have! With Kids or Without Kids!
review/text: Amazing! When you can't have a campfire and you've got the craving for S'mores, Pepperidge Farms had created an awesome FUN FISH!<br />Zany as Zany can be - Vanilla Gold Fish, Chocolate Goldfish, and of course - Marshmallow Goldfish - Stack'em up; but make sure<br />you hide your evidence if you want these to be ALL YOURS or otherwise they'll be gone before you get a chance to be a "kid at<br />heart"! Having bought two bags... thinking I would like these very much (how right I was!)...<br /><br />I was downright impressed, while not the traditional S'mores - but gee whiz; I actually ate the whole danged bag in one sitting<br />without even realizing it! *blush*  It was so much fun hunting or is it fishing (?) for one after another and then stacking them<br />together and eating "fishbait" - hahahahahaha!<br /><br />Next day, began to open the other bag (already!) and started to munch away ....<br /><br />Until, my grandchildren saw the "evidence" and wahhh :( - Poor Grandma here - ended up having to "share" and goodness gracious,<br />the laughter and giggles from the little ones were far worth it all!<br /><br />I 10,000 times recommend this ... this is the best ever from Pepperidge Farms! Way to go! Now if they can come up with the big box,<br />I'd buy it on Amazon in a heartbeat! Who would ever dream that Pepperidge Farms would come up with this? Just awesome!<br /><br />Interestingly, the very next day; while I had to babysit the youngest grandchild for a short time; she went off looking for something<br />that I had to inquire what she was looking for and she kept saying Whitey, Blackie and Creamy.  Looking everywhere in my room even<br />under the bed, leaving me totally bewildered until she sulked and said<br /><br />"Grandma, where did you hide them?"<br /><br />"Hide what?"<br /><br />"The 3 goldfishies"<br /><br />(puzzled)<br /><br />"The 3 Goldfishes? We don't have Goldfish in the house."<br /><br />(now she is mad with her arms folded)<br /><br />"Yes we do, we ate them yessteday! Grandma, where did you hide them?"<br /><br />(trying not to laugh)<br /><br />"Sweetie, we ate them all up yesterday."<br /><br />"Grandma, buy more. I like them lots! Tummy hungry, says want more goldfish."<br /><br />(points to her stomach)<br /><br />Kids are adorable! &lt;3  If you buy them, make sure you stash some for yourself, they are completely<br />and you just cannot resist them!

review/summary: Best bold k-cup
review/text: After getting a Keurig I did a massive taste test of the 20 or so bold/extra bold varieties from different brands.  This was definitely my favorite - nice smooth taste, with none of the bitter/acidic/funky tinges many of the others had (stay away from Green Mountain 'Espresso').  The only other k-cup to come close was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUGY">Coffee People K-Cup Dark Roast, Extra Bold Jet Fuel for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>. (Green Mountain's other extra bold varieties - Kenyan AA, Double Black Diamond, Dark Magic - were a distant third; didn't find anything good from Timothy's/Emeril.)  If you want to do your own sampling without committing to a whole box, I definitely recommend Keurig's site - you can get 'extra bold' variety packs, as well as 5-cup samples of individual flavors.

Tonight when my families dinner plans fell through, I thought I would try them for a quick dinner.<br /><br />They were fantastic. I followed the directions - throwing in some fresh asparagus in the water at the last min. then made a quick cream sauce.  They were truly wonderful - one package was enough for my very hungry teenager, husband and me.  I was especially happy with the texture as the last brand of gnocchi I purchased was just a bit gritty.

She was ecstatic when these arrived (I sent them straight from the seller). Apparently they stood up to the memory of the real fresh thing back east, repeating 'yummy' over and over again to us after she cooked them. Also, she is not one to complicate a meal so I'm sure she made them as instructed and added an average tomato sauce and was still excited about them.

review/summary: Delicious gluten-free bread
review/text: I think this bread is wonderful. I make it by hand (not in a bread machine), and I don't even have a mixer. I just put the ingredients in a bowl and stir it together until combined and pour it in my bread pan, and it turns out perfectly delicate, moist, and tasty. When I proof the yeast, I have found that it works better if I add a pinch of sugar to the water, and I also give the yeast 10 minutes to foam; 5 minutes didn't seem to be enough. Because of this bread and the whole grain mix, I see the GF diet as much more feasible. It's great bread even compared to gluten breads. And I find the bread sweet enough just as it is. I've found it's best to let the bread cool completely, slice it, and then freeze it, otherwise it will get hard and/or mold more quickly since it's not full of preservatives. It toasts up well.

review/summary: Good!
review/text: I was afraid that my yeast was already dead, because the bread didn't seem to be rising very much.  I added a very ripe banana to the mix, and I left the bread on top of the oven while the oven was preheating.  It took awhile for it to rise, so then I opened the oven door.  Within an hour the dough rose beautifully and the bread was delicious.  I was so happy to have gluten free bread that actually had some flavor.

review/summary: gluten-free cinnamon-raisin bread
review/text: The cinnamon-raisin bread mix is delicious - plenty of raisins and the cinnamon flavor is just right. I am so happy to have found Bob's Red Mill products.  I was so tired of eating the cardboard-like gluten-free bread carried in the stores.

review/summary: INCONSISTENT RESULTS
review/text: MAY 2012 UPDATE! Once again, every loaf has turned out differently.  I followed the directions to the letter but it turns out differently every time.  The last loaf was pretty good, but, the one I made today came out small, hard on the outside, with areas inside that were still raw dough!  I think it is time to take this off my list!<br /><br />If you want really good, really consistent bread, try Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread.  I bake a loaf a week and have never had a failure.  It is a full-sized loaf, real sandwich bread size slices that hold together well for sandwiches.  Love it!<br /><br />OLD REVIEW:<br />I bought a case of this bread mix a while back.  I've really missed cinnamon raisin toast since going gluten-free.  I'd made three loaves.  One turned out so-so, and, the other two were complete failures!  I added sugar for the yeast to feast on, but, that didn't seem to help with two of the loaves.  I was disappointed and had decided I wouldn't order this again.  However, I had one package left and, last night, I decided to try it in my bread machine.  Since I couldn't find the paddle, I mixed the bread in a mixing bowl first (probably a good idea anyway).  I added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the yeast and water.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  I mixed it for about three minutes in my electric mixer...much longer than the suggested time on the back of the package.  I put it in the bread machine and set it for a medium loaf.  Well, it worked!  This bread is the best I've gotten out of that machine since I went gluten-free!  The slices are actually "normal" sized and it is delicious!  So, I ordered another case and I will let you know if I get the same excellent results again!

review/summary: Filled with Raisins
review/text: I was hesitant to order another gluten free bread mix for fear it would turn out dry and tasteless. This bread mix was fantastic. I let the yeast sit for 5 minutes as directed, but let the batter sit in a loaf pan for an extra 30 minutes to rise. The cinnamon and raisin flavor is just right and the bread does not feel like cardboard! I would also recommend testing the internal temperature as recommended to prevent hardening. This bread mix is much better than the cornbread mix. Amazon shipped the item quickly and in perfect condition (as usual).

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: None of these turned out well - problems with all yeast packets. The bread never rose properly -whether done in the breadmaker or baked.  The bread was heavy and hardened very quickly.  Definitely not what I expected.

review/summary: a real treat
review/text: i have been gluten free for 6 months now and have really missed treats like cinnamon buns...i made this bread this morning on the gluten-free setting of my bread machine. it came out perfectly andwas just what i needed to satisfy that craving. from the other reviews, i think that perhaps this one is really meant for a bread machine.

review/summary: Purchased at the Local Grocers
review/text: I purchased this at the local grocery store, which is actually a chain, called Sprouts. It looked so good and I had read some rave reviews on here, plus used some of his other products that were great <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ED9L3K">Bob's Red Mill Wheat Free Biscuit & Baking Mix, 24-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a> and so I thought this was a "Shoo In" for good bread. I was to take the bread for Bible Study Breakfast, so I bought a bag and could not wait to give it a try.<br /><br />I easily mixed it up and did (thankfully) add extra raisins though I was cautioned that I did not need to do so and popped this into the oven. (I did not have a breadmaker at the time). It smelled wonderful while baking, and looked great when it popped out of the oven. I proudly carried it over to the Breakfast, where I sliced it since it was now cool, and presented it for the attendees to sample a slice or two. Great quality butter was right beside it.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LNPHNA">Kerrygold Pure Irish Butter - Unsalted (8 ounce)</a>. After slicing, I popped a small group of crumbs into my mouth expecting to savor the wonder. YEEEECH. Well, maybe not QUITE that bad, but close.<br /><br />The bread DID have some raisin flavor. Thank goodness for the extra handful of raisins. If I were to do it again, I would add two handfuls. But otherwise, it was dry and fairly tastless...Thank the good Lord for the Butter. The Butter was good enough that no one really said much about this loaf of bread.<br /><br />After the first pass and choices of goodies, I noticed, that on the second time up, people took one of my other breads:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL6X4">Dassant Cinnamon Chip Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> or<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL71K">Dassant Pumpkin Spice Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. So at least, I was saved from all out banishment and you KNOW that is what happens to Bible Study Ladies who cannot cook!<br /><br />So again, I do not recommend this bread as it is dry and tasteless. If you MUST make it, add raisins liberally prior to baking. Purchase good butter to go with it. Ice it too! But--just go with something else if you can.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQEBE">Leonard Mountain Hazelnut Raisin Bread Mix, 17-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> or make this because I have and It is Yummy:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M1Z1EQ">New Orleans Gourmet Foods Traditional Bread Pudding Mix W/raisins, 8.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>!
