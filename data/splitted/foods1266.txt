review/summary: Misrepresented item
review/text: I ordered this Rougie GOOSE Foie Gras about a year ago and it was pretty good.  I went to my account and pulled up the exact same Rougie Goose Foie Gras that I had previously ordered.  The title at the top said "Rougie Goose Foie Gras". I did not look closely at the product assuming that the title was not a lie and because it was the same product that I previously ordered.  When it came, I received DUCK foie gras with port wine.  When I checked the amazon page, it was titled GOOSE FOIS Gras, yet upon closer inspection the details said duck.  Of course this is non-refundable. Buyer beware of this BAIT AND SWITCH.

review/summary: 10 year old Roland Mushrooms, Dried Sliced Cepes - Bolets ?
review/text: I just got 2 jars of Roland Mushrooms, Dried Sliced Cepes - Bolets from Amazon.com at $16.35 for a 1lb jar. I thought it is deal to good to be true, but I bought it anyway. Right after opening the jar I realized I made a big mistake. Mushrooms, and especially bolets should pleasantly smell and not stink. The content of the jar stinks. I am not sure if such mushrooms are appropriate for human consumption. Of course, I paid for it and I will Try it. However, I think I discovered the reason for this stink. You see, I purchased some other Roland products, like sliced olives, roasted paprika, etc. On sliced olives for example it says "Packaged for 2010 Roland Company...", and on Roasted paprika it says "Packaged for 2011 Roland Company..." But on the jar with Roland Mushrooms, Dried Sliced Cepes - Bolets it says "Packaged for 2001 Roland Company.." Is it possible that Amazon.co is selling Roland Mushrooms stored for the past 10 years? Unfortunately, there is no expiration date on the jar. Anyway, a freshly opened jar of dried bolets with clearly defined expiration date I purchased in a local store (1 year before expiration date) smells a lot different.

review/summary: Smoked Herring
review/text: These smoked herring, packaged in a can that is in the box, are very good. They are<br />not packed in tons of oil, so are much healthier for those of us who want to maintain<br />a reasonable weight. The flavor is excellent, no tinny undertaste. I use them by<br />broiling them briefly with a small pat of "good" light margarine, i.e. as what the<br />Brits call kippers, and eat them for breakfast with a slice of wholegrain bread or<br />toast. They seem to be the same as those sold at Trader Joe's under the TJ brand.<br />Unfortunately, Trader Joe is extremely unreliable in terms of stocking them in stores.<br />For those who don't think fish is for breakfast, these smoked herring are excellent<br />as a canape or snack served with crackers. Highly recommended. A good way to<br />get those healthy fish oils, too! Best bargain on Amazon for smoked herring.

review/summary: Only average smoked herring
review/text: The Roland smoked herring had good flavor and would have earned a four star rating, but they were consistently mushy and lacked the firmness that I highly value in a sardine or any herring.  Every can I opened contained broken or easily broken herring that would fall apart on my fork. Perhaps they were overcooked or something in the canning process leads to this, but Roland doesn't earn my repeat business with the smoked herring.

review/summary: Tasty but a bit mushy - better when warm
review/text: It tastes like what Herrings should taste like.  I like the fact that it's not packed in oil, so I can actually mix the liquid into my breakfast oatmeal.  It doesn't have a strong fish smell, and should not annoy people sensitive to fish.  I was expecting a bit firmer flesh, but I guess Roland smoke their herrings thoroughly so the meat is a bit mushy.  But again, it's very tasty.<br /><br />BTW, since the herrings are fatty, if you save unfinished fish in the can inside the fridge, there will be a film of fish oil on top when you open it.  I usually place the whole can inside a toaster oven and heat it up for a few minutes to get the oil back to liquid form.  I actually like the taste better when it's warm.

They are not too salty which is good.  The size of the can is great, I wish they all came in a 6-7ounce can.  3.5-3.75ounces is not enough for my liking.

review/summary: Great idea, but not too flavorful and unfriendly to teeth
review/text: I wanted to like these crackers, given the awesome nutritional profile and ingredients.  I would say two and a half stars, and it's because the idea is great but the execution is not so good.  I'm just unhappy that I'm stuck with five more bags of these things.<br /><br />There are two primary weaknesses:<br /><br />1) Lack of flavor.  I think I need to try the other cracker flavors, because these are just whole flaxseeds with some Bragg Liquid Aminos (soy sauce, basically) and lemon juice, and the flavor is just not enough for me.<br /><br />2) Awful chewing experience.  When you eat one of these, the flaxseeds stick. Everywhere. Between your teeth. On the roof of your mouth. Lodged around your jaw.  Really, it takes a long time to feel like you don't have flax embedded everywhere in your mouth.  Not a very social snack, for this reason.<br /><br />I hope they keep working on this, as the idea is good.

review/summary: Gluten Free, Vegan, 0 Net Carbs!
review/text: Mmmmm....just got these today and decided to write this review.  This is actually my first review on amazon ever!  I found out about these crackers a few weeks ago, and have been calling all over to find them locally, but to no avail.  Luckily, they are available on amazon!<br /><br />If you like flax, you will like these.  They have some patented process that keeps the flax whole, but makes it thin and crisp, so you grind them up in your mouth when you chew (flax eaters know that a whole, raw flax seed likely won't get broken apart when you chew it, and then you don't end up getting all the good stuff in flax!).  The flavor on these is very slight, with only Bragg's liquid aminos and lemon juice on the ingredient list (besides flax).  Bragg's liquid aminos is a great product, pretty much soy sauce with no gluten (it's 100% fermented soy, so in a sense, it really is a true soy sauce and has a similar flavor to all the soy sauces on the market), and I use it in place of soy sauce for lots of things, so that's another great product to check out, as well.  The lemon juice isn't apparent, and doesn't taste lemony in the least.  These crackers are gluten free and vegan, and are a good match for those on specialty diets.  Also, with just 3 ingredients, they could probably be easily incorporated into rotation diets as well.<br /><br />I tried one plain right out of the pouch, and they are slightly salty (from the Bragg's).  Their texture reminds me of pumpkin seeds with the shell on.  After sampling it plain, I put peanut butter on one, and the slight savory underpinnings of the cracker and the peanut butter go very well together.  I'm looking forward to eating these with all sorts of things, and am very pleased I bought them, even though I had no idea what I was in for with a case of healthfood I'd never tried.<br /><br />Flax is great for many things healthwise, and it is also unique in that it has 0 net carbs.  That's right, all the carbs in there are 100% dietary fiber.  Low-carbers should do a web search for the "one minute muffin" made with flax meal in the microwave....they're really good and totally versatile, and really do make a low carb bread or muffin.<br /><br />The only issue I have with these is a little tiny warning on the bottom saying they use 99.99% clean flax, but sometimes a little stone may be in there.  I'm not overly concerned with this, and have had 5 crackers with no issue (will post back when, if at all, I encounter one, and how many bags it took me to find it....would be interested to hear from others how big a danger this really is....), though a friend decided not to eat one based on this as she had recently had crown work, so just be aware that there is a remote possibility!<br /><br />They have several other flavors, and I may try them one day, but I'm really pleased with these and so glad I found them!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have consumed the entire case (6 bags) and did not find any pebbles or rocks.  I did find a few (3 or 4 in the whole case, so not even one in every bag) very hard seeds (they were definitely flax seeds) that were not chewable and did feel like biting down on piece of something rock-like.  All of these hard seeds were very dark, nearly black in color (burned? under-ripe? not shelled?), though not every dark seed was one of these hard seeds.  I don't think that this is a reason to not consume these, but did want to offer an honest assessment of the "safety" of the product, esp. for individuals who have weak teeth.

review/summary: Good taste, all natural, but Italian Zest flavor more yummy
review/text: Excellent price! Got these when Amazon out of Italian Zest flavor.  I liked it OK, but the kids missed their Italian Zest & refused to eat this. I must admit I like the Italian Zest better too - nice italian-y taste. The Regular flavor here has a good flavor w/out being too spicy or garlicky (no garlic here!) - good if you're adverse to heavy seasoning or spicy-ness. Excellent way to get your fiber & fatty acids - a no-guilt snack! Dehydrated at low temps to preserve the raw goodness. Also, if you are on a rotation diet, or just like things simple, this one has a VERY short ingredient list - just flax, Bragg's liquid aminos (has soy but NO gluten) & lemon juice! Both flavors can be brittle & the occasional seed may get in your teeth. Do be sure to protect the bag somewhat or else you'll have a bag of seeds instead of crackers. (The seeds are yummy too, though!)

review/text: These crackers are great. I think they are the best low-carb cracker option. However, the dried flax does seem to get stuck in your teeth, not the seeds like you would think, rather the munched up cracker. Eating them with something helps.

review/summary: Adds Crunch and Fiber for Low Carbers and Gluten Free Diets
review/text: Trying to stay away from carbs or gluten means missing the crunch that comes with eating peanut butter on a cracker or having a tuna fish sandwich on toast.  This cracker, while not a delicious option on its own because of its plain favor, is the perfect accompaniment to a spoonful of natural peanut butter or a portion of tuna salad.  The crunch and fiber is satisfying.<br /><br />The crackers are broken up from a large sheet, so the sizes are not uniform enough to actually sandwich food between them, but I use them on the side to dip and scoop the peanut butter, tuna salad, or even guacamole. They are on the expensive side, so I usually save all the crumbs and small pieces in the bag once the larger pieces are gone.  I then dump the crumbs into tuna or peanut butter, mix it up, and eat.<br /><br />I love them!

review/summary: Crock Cooking base
review/text: This is a great product, especially for cheap pieces of meat.  I start it the night before on low and when I get home from work the next day, it is awesome.  You can add the vegetables you like and the taste is great.  It has a little salty taste, but not too much (especially if you add quartered potatoes.  I had a packet from a sale in my cupboard.  It was a few years old and made stuff really salty, but the fresher packets that I ordered were much better.  No need to chop up the meat if you buy a big cheap chunk.  It will fall apart when you finish cooking it. My husband and son love it and they are very picky eaters.

review/text: Just made this today and it was good.  I added 2 cups of water with the seasoning packet then added to the crock pot with a beef roast.  The seasoning was basically brown gravy but to me it was perfect as in not to salty as well as a good consistency.  My family came back for seconds and thirds including myself.  I would definitely purchase this again and I love coming home and my dinner is already prepared with no extra effort.

review/text: This is the only way I make my roast beef, in the crockpot with this awsome seasoning. Roast comes out tender and melts in your mouth. To make the gravy I remove some of the liquid in the crockpot, dilute with a little water or it's too salty, then thicken on the stove top with equal parts of flour and water. Makes the best gravy ever!!

review/summary: Rich and delicious chili
review/text: I have used many chili mixes but this is my families favorite by a landslide. We can't find it in our local stores anymore so thank goodness it can be found here on Amazon. I don't follow the recipie on the box. After experimenting with this mix many times, I have found the following instuctions will result in probably  the best chili we have ever had-  I use the 12 cup mix ( added to 1.5-1.75 pounds ground round, 2 large ( 29 oz)  cans of good tomato sauce or puree , 1 15 ounce can of diced or whole tomatoes and 1 15 ounce can of undrained  kidney beans.) Sometimes I add a can of mexicorn. This makes perfect chili everytime- just the right heat with a hint of sweetness. It is the perfect thickness made as described  above and even better heated up the next day as  the flavors blend overnight.  Everyone raves over this chili and says it is the best they ever had, it really is chili cook off quality.

review/summary: Tasty chili seasoning mix
review/text: I really like this chili seasoning mix.  I tried the 6 cup seasoning pack which only called for 1 cup water, 1 can tomato sauce, 1 can dark kidney beans, 3/4 lb ground beef.  I shorted the ground beef a bit.  Also I don't usually like kidney beans but I decided to at least try their recommendations.  I even liked the kidney beans in this chili.  I prefer a zesty and slightly spicy chili flavor and this one fit that bill.  I really like things that help provide a semi-homemade method which combines less available prep time with enough home provided ingredients.  This fit that definition very easily.  The recommended cooking time is 25 minutes.  It may be a bit salty for some based on personal preferences.  I am planning on creating gift baskets for folks with several Cugino's seasoning and soup mixes based on how tasty this line has been so far.

review/summary: quick meal - great chili!
review/text: We were given the chili mix by a friend.  I was very skeptical.  Chili is one of our family's favorite meals - always made from scratch.  The box calls for 3/4 lbs browned hamburger and 16 oz tomato sauce (our box made 6 servings).  I added 1.1 lbs meat, the sauce, 1 can each of black beans and kidney beans.  There was plenty of sauce to accommodate the additional beans and meat.  Everyone loved it!  Hopefully we can find it at a local store, if not we will be ordering from Amazon.

Very strange...the chips are great, but the cookie part of, well, these cookies, has a nondescript, bland, processed/white-sugar taste. No, you cannot compare the taste to a sugar cookie- it's like an alien's version of a chocolate-chip cookie hastily made in order to use to lure a human to its/his/her spacecraft. The brown sugar is just not kickin' here, so just kick these to the curb.

review/text: What can be said negative about Pepperidge Farm Cookies.....ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! These soft baked, milk chocolate variety from Pepperidge Farm comes with 8 deliciously decadent cookies per package with a total of 5 packages per order and is mouth watering for any cookie or chocolate lover period! To boot, since this type of variety of Pepperidge Farm Cookies NEVER goes on sale at the supermarket or grocery store(at least where I live) unlike Milano and their Goldfish Brands, it would cost you $3.49 per bag X5, for a total of $16.95. Except I pick these up all the time through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for anywhere between my most recent purchase for 5 bags @ $11.04-$11.82 in the past, so you can't go wrong! If the Warehouse Deals(when available) or straight Amazon have a listing available at a higher price then mentioned in this review, then BE PATIENT and rest assure that the price will come down and you'll snag a great bargain like I do all the time on a regular basis. Having some now, Mmmmm!

review/text: I love Pepperidge farm Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies. They make the perfect snack. While other cookies are hard and dry with the texture of sawdust these cookies taste great, and are soft like they've just come out of the oven.<br /><br />Downsides? Each cookie is 130 calories which is a lot for such a small cookie. Also these contain interesterified fats/oils which are chemically altered oils. Not really great for humans to consume.<br /><br />The result? I think I'll bake my own... Without the chemicals. It would probably be safer. 5 star taste. 2 star ingredients. Rating, Average.

I got a notice on the 17th that my order would be delayed and that my new delivery estimate was right before Christmas, between December 23 and 24th.  I approved the delay only to receive another message on Christmas Eve that I would not receive the seeds in time for Christmas, and that my approval was needed for another new arrival estimate between Jan 3rd and Jan 9th.  I grudgingly agreed to the delay, because I really wanted to give this gift to someone who I know loves chocolate covered sunflower seeds.  They finally showed up, a month after ordering them, on January 7th.  After waiting so long and hearing from many people that Trader Joe's products are yummy, I expected them to be good.  I gave the seeds to the family member whom I bought them for, and we both tried them.  We both agreed they are edible, but sub-par.  I have had several other brands that were MUCH better.  I will not order these again.

review/summary: Not a good Christmas stolen.
review/text: I am in search of a good German Christmas stolen. Such a stolen should have powdered sugar on it and dried fruits inside. The consistency should be cake like and firm. This stolen was a complete waste of my money (with shipping, almosty $30).<br />The sugar covering was not powdered by a glaze that cracked when I cut it. The cake was dry and tasteless and crumbled when I cut it. I was okay with paying $30 for what I thought would be a good stoeln but this was not good at all. The stolen looks nothing like the picture and was a huge disappointment.My suggestion is, if this is the only stolen you can find, forget about buying one as you will be disappointed.

review/summary: Wow!  The best smelling and tasting coconut oil yet!
review/text: I'm very strict with my diet.  I eat only organic foods, practice CRON (calorie restriction with optimal nutrition), eat minimal carbs and lots of nutrients.  I've tested 4 other brands of organic coconut oil -- Nutiva, Spectrum Naturals, and 2 small scale raw food companies.  This one is easily the best so far.<br /><br />The aroma is wonderful and the texture is much fuller than the other brands.  This coconut oil has fuller taste and less watered-down feeling than the other brands. So if you're looking for a good organic coconut oil, this is the one.<br /><br />Now for some quick facts about how amazingly healthy this stuff is:<br /><br />1) Medium chain fatty acids --> Digest very easily without requiring the gall bladder to do much.  Great for people missing gallbladders and truly everyone.<br /><br />2) Converts to usable energy very quickly.  A much more balanced and less manic energy than any carbohydrate (fructose, lactose, glucose, etc)<br /><br />3) Anti-viral, anti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal.  Keeps your digestive system very clean inside.  Helps destroy candida and balance intestinal (probiotic) bacteria.  Helps the immune system.<br /><br />4) Longer lasting energy without insulin levels being adversely affected.  Fats are the cleanest burning energy for our body.  Carbohydrates cause insulin levels to raise and crash, which is what creates the "eat every 3 hours" cravings that so many people this is hunger.  Healthy fats, like this oil, will not affect insulin and give us much more stable energy that last longer in the body.<br /><br />5) Tastes great.  Smells great.<br /><br />6) Can be used topically to make the skin very soft.  Is absorbed into the skin to nourish it, unlike most cosmetic moisturizers which leave residue or cause long-term dryness by unbalancing the body's innate skin oil balance.<br /><br />7) Can be used as a sexual lubricant.  Coconut oil is a natural anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial lubricant which helps keep these organs clean and reduce the spread of unwanted problem.<br /><br />8) Great for hair and can be used as a leave-on conditioner.  Like it's skin use, coconut oil will not imbalance the body's natural oils.... unlike chemical-based conditioners.  Plus, because coconut is anti-"everything bad" it will keep the hair clean too!<br /><br />9) Coconut oil detox cleanse.  The medium chain fatty acids make this and ideal food for detox cleanses because the energy is available with minimal digestive effort, plus all of it's anti-"everything bad" properties.  The detox cleanse is a 3 to 7 day process where all carbohydrate foods are removed and coconut oil is eaten as the primary energy source (approx. 14 Tablespoons each day).  The oil can be combined with organic lemon water as well.  You can find the instructions by Googling "Natural News Coconut Oil Cleanse".<br /><br />Basically, coconut oil is amazing!  And this brand is the best I've found so far.  Enjoy!<br /><br />*** Update: I found a good website for coconut oil information and recipes. It has summaries of many studies on coconut oil.  Visit coconutdiet (dotcom)

review/summary: AWESOME COCONUT OIL! AWESOME DEAL!
review/text: Wow! I love this coconut oil! I have read about the wonders of coconut oil (increases metabolism, antiviral/antifungal/antibacterial properties, etc) and decided to start adding it to my daily diet. This brand is superb -- taste soooooo good and smells divine. I have used it on my toast and it could easily replace butter because the taste is buttery smooth and with very slight sweetness. The smell is not overwhelming and it's just very mild.<br />Another plus is the price -- such a great deal for 32 ounces! I have looked around at different online and local stores for high quality coconut oil and the price cannot touch this, the only thing cheaper would be the low quality, rancid-smelling coconut oil being sold at local stores.<br />Coconut oil will melt at 76 degrees, so I kept mine in the refrigerator to keep it solid.  I've also used this as a moisturizer for my itchy and dry spots and works like a charm, easily melts when applied. I've divided mine for kitchen and body use -- simply wonderful!<br />Highly recommended!

review/text: Efa Gold is indeed a superlative.  The taste is yummy; not at all like putting a spoonful of regular oil, even Olive, in your mouth.  The taste is slightly sweet and definitely coconut.  I use it for my skin and hair and it's just amazing what it does, even to an 80 year old.  I had to go for a 2nd haircut this month, my hair grew in so fast.  I also cook with it.  The only down side is that I use so much I needed to buy another 1/2 gallon inside of one month.  Good coconut oil is expensive but it beats buying meds!!

review/summary: Not the right coconut oil for chefs.
review/text: This oil is substandard for cooking.  I've been cooking primarily in coconut oil for over a year now, and have tried many brands.  Most good oil has a very light flavor, maybe a bit buttery, but not overwhelming.  This oil has a very distinct coconut flavor, similar to the meat or milk of the coconut.  This renders it useless for cooking almost everything.  It's just not a clean oil.  The only redeeming factor for this product (which pushes it up to two stars from one) is the fact that it adds amazing flavor to dishes with tropical flavors like many Thai and curry recipes.  It makes them absolutely great, but spend your money elsewhere if you're looking for a coconut oil for general sauteing and frying.

review/text: When I first heard about Coconut oil I laughed but I researched it and figured it wouldn't hurt me to try it out.  I've only been using for a week and swear by it.<br /><br />Excellent for cooking, is a very good appetite suppressant, great for skin and hair also.  I'm a nibbler and from the first day of trying this, I don't nibble all day.  I eat a healthy breakfast, cooking with the coconut oil, add a bit to the coffee I take with me.  I eat half what I normally would have for lunch and I'm not hungry again until I get off work and it's time for dinner. Then I only have a lite dinner.  I also don't experience that 3:00pm slump.

review/text: This is the second time I've bought this brand of coconut oil.  I like it, it's very coconut-y, I use it for cooking and baking.  When it's cold though, the oil turns hard and it's harder to use for baking, as the oil hardens up.  I also have a smaller container of it in the bathroom and I use it as moisturizer for my hands and I love the way it smells.

review/text: I absolutely love this product. Primarily, I use it for my skin and hair. My texture is a little on the coarse side so I put this product in my hair after wash/conditioner. After towel drying my hair (but with my hair still damp) I rub it into my scalp then all over my hair. There is an immediate difference with my texture becoming softer, shinier and healthy looking/feeling. My family is from the Carribean so I grew up using real coconut in my hair and on my skin. What makes this product so great is that it's as natural as coconut in a jar can come and it smells great too.

I have made gluten free biscuits, scones, granola bars, pie crusts, cookies and breads with this brand and love it's versatility.  I have had other brands 'bake out' of my foods, but this one acts like butter when baking.  I like the taste, and I am not a coconut enthusiast.  I also use it to make a natural sugar scrub for the shower, lotion bars and for moisturizing bath salts.  This is the best price I have found, especially with the free shipping.  The health benefits of this oil are just a bonus for our family, it makes baking gluten/dairy/egg free much easier and tastier!!

review/text: Well needless to say, this is my second review on this product (I think).  I absolutely love this stuff.  I've decided to go with the bigger jar (since mine doesn't last a month) on the subscribe and save.  I mix this with my shea butter.  Since I'm a bit of a chemist in my family I decided to mix a concoction for us.  This changes the scent of the shea butter a bit since I'm not really into the scent, even though I have gotten used to the scent from the first seller I purchased the shea butter from.  I've also noticed my eczema has vanished since I've been using the pure coconut oil on my skin.  My skin looks over all wonderful with more of a glow, I even noticed when I stopped putting this on my skin after the shower (ran out of coconut oil) that my skin problem tried to come back, so I'll have to start up again. Whoever buys this is going to love it, I just suggested that you buy the 32 oz. since you'll probably be using it for everything from kitchen to bathroom.

Also, I have heard that coconut ester is being looked at for helping people with Alzheimer's disease.

review/summary: Awesome Coconut oil & great price!!
review/text: For my dog:<br />I have been using this oil for a couple weeks now on & off.  I have just started giving it to my dog (who has been limping & having trouble rising from a sitting & laying position)for about a week now.  HE LOVES IT!  He can't wait to get his dog treat in the morning with it smeared on one side and in the afternoon it is the first thing he eats out of his food (I put about a tablespoon sized dollop on top of his dry dog food).  I have definitely noticed an improvement in his mobility & his coat seems to be much softer.  I had also done some research & found out that it will eliminate stinky dog breath!  I can't wait for that to happen. It is safe for cats too... If you want to know more about giving it to your pets, just do a Google search using the words "coconut oil for my pets" and plenty of info will be at your fingertips! :)<br /><br />For my kids:<br />I have done extensive research on Coconut oil & the benefits it has on our bodies. I can tell you that the antiviral benefit it has definitely works. My son (recently turned 12)just recently had a virus that included coughing, a sore throat and had caused him to break out in a rash that only spread onto one side of his body... Doctor said it had to run it's course.  I started giving him some of this oil on toast with the normal butter & cinnamon sugar & within a couple days he started getting better. We stopped giving him the oil & he got sick again... So we started the oil again, but this time HE was putting it on things, himself, to eat--he realized that it was making him better the first time. I think that maybe we didn't give it enough time to work the first time.  For my daughter: After a couple of days of sleeping a ton, being very sick & calling me at work crying because she couldn't stay awake, I took my daughter (13 y.o. then, 17 y.o. now) to the doctor & she was diagnosed with Mono. The doctor explained to me that it is part of the Epstein Barr family (cold sores, herpes, etc.) and that there isn't any kind of medicine that can "cure" the illness. He explained that she would sleep a lot, that I needed to call her school & tell them what she had & that she would only be there half days for a few months. I was deflated, stressed & couldn't believe there was nothing I could do for her. I had recently read a book that included coconut oil as a way to detox, lose weight, boost metabolism and so many others and had bought some oil to cook with & take daily. I had done a search & read as much as I could about the coconut & remembered reading that it killed the Epstein Barr virus. I went straight to my computer when I got home & did another search & found the article I had read. I decided to give my daughter the oil twice a day to see if it helped her. I called her down & melted the oil in a spoon & had her take it that afternoon & then again later that evening. The next morning before I left for work I gave her another dose. She called me around lunch time very happy and excited and said she wasn't tired and could stay awake. I remember thinking that the oil was working and was very relieved, but still a bit hesitant. When I got home to my surprise, she was very excited, wide awake & for the first time since she was sick, was chipper and I could tell she was getting back to her old self. I gave her another dose of the oil that evening & for a few days after and she was all better. The oil had killed the virus and restored her health.<br /><br />This stuff is amazing... it cooks food well & is fabulous for your skin.  If you burn in the sun, this will help prevent that as well.  If you are a coconut user this stuff is great... If you're not, this is worth a try.

review/text: This is my first 'coconut oil' purchase, which means I was scrutinizing it for several factors.<br /><br /> - Taste: nice without any after effects<br /><br /> - Consistency: stays soft or hard, according to where it is stored. Recommended to keep in a cupboard, but can be refrigerated during warmer climes. If you chose to use coconut oil in a recipe, adding it to cold ingredients will make it solidify instantly, so keep this in mind. As soon as I add it to the 'wet' ingredients for pancakes (egg/egg whites, almond milk, vanilla), I whisk it up immediately. I will get tiny bits of coconut, but better than big chunks<br /><br />- Cooking: After cooking, which I mainly notice with pancakes (I use a homemade mix from Keith Snow's 'Harvest Eating'), the pancakes turn out very light. Still, after flipping the pancakes show the 'holes' (from the batter boiling on the grill) and has a light browning texture. I also find I do not have to add extra 'greasing' to the pan (if using Teflon-coated - I recently purchased an excellent T-Fal griddle pan here on Amazon. Best I've ever owned!) As for vegetable or other frying additives, the coconut does impart a slight coconutty taste. I thought it was good, but if you want, add other seasonings you like. (I also like 'Harvest Eating' seasoning, which has s&p, cumin and herbs. Another is Selene Yeager's, from Men's Health/Cycling advocate, 'Curry' seasoning)<br /><br />- minor issue: capping and uncapping: the oil does not spill easily. Helps using a metal spoon, as opposed to silicone spatula. Make sure you use a clean spoon each time and don't contaminate the container with other foods, or else you chance breaching the integrity of the product.<br /><br />- other comment: Product claims it can be utilized for hair care and skin care. I have used it only for cooking, but accidentally got some on my hands. Instead of washing off, I rubbed it in! :)<br /><br />I think I've covered everything. Nature's Way is very good and I highly recommend it.

review/text: This is one of the best buys for the money.  I have tried other more expensive brands, but do not feel they are worth the cost.  I have used this coconut oil in cooking, for health, for hair treatments, and for body lotions and scrubs and have loved the results every time.  And I truly appreciate the convenience of having it shipped to my home in just a couple of days.

review/text: Coconut oil is a very useful, and healthful oil,<br /> either as a substitute for less healthy cooking oils,<br /> or as a healthful nutritional supplement in its own right.<br />At 55� per oz., its not inexpensive, but this price is great,<br /> compared to some other sources.<br />I've tried a few brands, and for me, I *love* the unrefined style.<br />The Nature's Way EfaGold is a good bargain, the taste is wonderful,<br /> if you like coconut, and while its a 'health food' in its own right,<br /> its also very useful for those struggling with fungus, mold,<br /> or yeast problems.<br />The Nature's Way EfaGold is great stuff, very tasty,<br /> and can aid with some weight loss programs.<br />While I wish we could buy it for a more reasonable price,<br /> I highly recommend it.

review/text: This is GREAT!!! Altzheimers is in both my husband's family, and mine. We are praying we don't have to suffer this. When reading a book on the disease, it was recommended to use this in your diet to avoid the big A. I ordered it immediately, and never run out. I use it to cook, add it to oatmeal, and any time I think of it. Is it working? I do not know, but I know we love the flavor. When cooking our veggies, I add a couple of tablespoons, potatoes/asparagus/peppers/onions and cook slowly while my meat is cooking. What a tasteful dish. I've served it to family, even our 16 year old granddaughter who hates veggies loved them.

review/text: Let me start by saying it smells wonderful, the scent smells like a roasted coconut. I applied it to my skin and it absorbs well. It does better for my skin than my hair right now. I have always used coconut oil on my hair but now a days my hair is telling me it needs a little heavier oil. So, I'm using the Jamician black castor oil on my hair. But I will never give up coconut oil, it makes my skin feel sooo good. I will buy again.
