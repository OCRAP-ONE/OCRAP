review/summary: dripping in oil
review/text: I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others.

review/text: If you are looking for STRONG S/V flavor these definitely aren't for you. Very mild in comparison to many others. I live in TX and I can tell you I've tried ALL S/V chips I can get ahold of. The best of the best are HEB (storebrand) and World Market. Bob's and Zapp's Aren't bad. From a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch, but if you're looking for S/V flavor these have "just a touch."

review/summary: Bags O' Salt with chips added.
review/text: I don't know if it was the case of chips we received or what, but everyone we allowed to sample the chips (in a buffet style setting) agreed that these were slightly on the salty side.<br />One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow, due to the amount of salt in these.<br /><br />We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips, but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite.<br /><br />Sorry folks, we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side.<br /><br />We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stock.<br />These got a 2 star, because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique.

review/summary: Kettle has sold out, the chips are horrible now
review/text: Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label "yeast extract".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore.

review/text: The chips were great...for the first few bags. However, after the first bag or two, I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged. There were holes in each bag and black, sticky stains on the outside. Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips.<br /><br />The chips came in a sealed Kettle box, so it's hard to say who screwed up. But someone somewhere screwed up. These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag. Now? It's like a game of roulette.

review/summary: Kettle Chips Make Great Mouse Food
review/text: After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive, upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse.  Don't know if it is still in the box, but it is outside on the porch.  When my son gets home, I'm going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon.  The outside Amazon box was intact, so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse, don't know which.  I will never buy these again from Amazon.  I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase.  It makes me sick to think about it!<br /><br />I included pictures at the top of the page.  Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now.<br /><br />Update:  I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they didn't want them.

Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in.

review/summary: Great Chip!
review/text: With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: "Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand� Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag"<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: "At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand�  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are "trans fat free" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging."  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period.

review/summary: Awesome and delicious!
review/text: These are among the best chips I have ever eaten!  I first came upon them when I visited a CostPlus World Market store in Opelika, AL, in the Tiger Town Mall, in 2007.  I wasn't a big fan of dijon-flavored anything, but I decided to give these chips a try.  I was hooked.  I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months' time.  I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them.  I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover, at the Patton Creek Shopping Center, and they did not carry this flavor.  However, when I learned that they were available on Amazon.com, and also available for PRIME Shipping - I bought them as soon as I read "Kettle Chips Honey Dijon, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)!"<br /><br />You get a pretty big box, filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels.  They last quite a while, but I will re-order, very, very soon!  I suggest you buy them, in this bulk form, and enjoy them - you won't be disappointed!  They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs - so they're perfect for spring and this coming summer's outdoor activities and cook-outs!<br /><br />Take my word for it, these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods!  Buy some today, and fall in love like me!

review/summary: One bite and you'll become a "chippoisseur"
review/text: I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."

They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know.  They are much more flavorful.  Never had a honey-dijon potato chip before.

review/text: When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet.

For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag.

review/summary: Pretty tasty and decently spiced. . . .
review/text: My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.<br /><br />Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.<br /><br />Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.<br /><br />All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . .

review/summary: Great Tasting Chips
review/text: After looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box, I had to write a review.  I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly.  There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00.  The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag.  I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.  I'll buy these again...soon.

review/summary: Kettle Chips, Sea Salt
review/text: There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The "best by" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October.

review/summary: Good deal but close expiration date!
review/text: I love this sea salt & vinegar flavor from Kettle.  When I saw this one on the daily deal here for $17.99/case, I put my order without doubt.  However, when I received the case, I found out that the whole case is expiring in December while I got it at the end of August.  I tried one package and I can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips.  I was disappointed and then I found out this item is not returnable!  How convenient!  Although I love this chips, I won't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date...

review/text: This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them. We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags. The Kettle chips were in a 2oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal. The chips are so delicious, baked not fried and lightly salted with Sea Salt. They have 0 fat, no preservatives, nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients. What more could you ask for in a great tasting chip!

review/text: These are the best spicy chips I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  They start off sweet, then as you eat more the spice builds up.  They are fantastic.  If you don't want to commit to a whole case, pick up a bag at your local Whole Foods first, then stock up here when you realize how amazing they are.  Got my case right here, and loving every bite.  On a side note, this brand (Kettle Brand) has many delicious varieties- this is just my personal favorite.  I also highly recommend: Backyard BBQ, Honey Dijon, Sweet Onion, Buffalo Bleu, Salt and Pepper and Death Valley Chipotle.  Lays aint got nothin on Kettle Brand!!!

I have never enjoyed unsalted potato chips before these.  They have a natural potato flavor with thick, crunchy chips.  The only bad thing is the bag is a pain to open.  Use scissors and save yourself the aggravation.

review/text: Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I've tasted thus far. They are thick, has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors. My favorite Kettle chip happens to be the honey Dijon. I think it's a great combination sweet, salty and tangy, perfect for one of those snack attacks when you don't know exactly what you want. I especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch. These 2-oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions (like me!).

review/text: As an Oregonian, I make a point of sharing these Oregon-made snacks with friends who visit the state. I tell them the Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrew does for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with Spicy Thai chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."<br /><br />I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a>.<br /><br />The Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing. The Honey Dijon chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />In summary, I highly recommend Kettle Brand chips, a great buy on Amazon.com.

review/text: These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're "kettle chips" and they're "fried" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!

Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food.

review/summary: Kettle Foods Spicy Thai Chips
review/text: The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed "ginger with attitude" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  "Great Taste Naturally" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!

review/text: I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars.

review/summary: Tangy and delicious snack
review/text: For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips, this is the one to choose. The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less "natural" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and that's why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5.

review/summary: Not low salt
review/text: These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a "low salt" item.  They seem as salty as any "regular" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy.

review/summary: Best Chips I've Ever Tasted
review/text: Fantastic tasting potato chips. I love the individual bags, great for kids and adults too. No trans fat, no cholesterol, no artifical stuff.<br />Low in sodium and high in potassium, which is great for people like me with HBP.<br />Only problem is Amazon is out of stock some times and price is high.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!

review/summary: Things you need to know
review/text: Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes "too much". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are "Krinkle Cut" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems.

review/summary: I made a mistake.....
review/text: This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  � homiedog �

review/summary: Do they have to "bite back"?
review/text: I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.

review/summary: These chips are awesome if not best but....
review/text: I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.

review/summary: Good flavor a little crumbly
review/text: For those of us who have to avoid gluten in our diet, Lucy's cookies offer a great solution for that sweet tooth.<br /><br />It was terrific to be able to order a mix of flavors so I could try them all. Each of the 6 flavors were very tasty. Regardless of flavor they were all extremely light, flavorful, and crunchy.<br /><br />One note, the aftermath of all that crunchy goodness are that crumbs fly everywhere no matter how careful or dainty one tries to be when eating them. Keep these babies clear of any "crumb free zones" in your house or plan on following people around with a dust-buster.<br /><br />Not to make the other flavors feel bad (I liked you all), I must confess that chocolate chip and cinnamon will be among the next items ordered.

review/summary: Antioxidant Refresher
review/text: ****<br /><br />This Pomegranate Green Tea from Yogi Tea is an antioxidant refresher. It's an all natural tea made from organic green tea leaf, organic hibiscus flowers, organic flavors, organic peppermint leaf, pomegranate juice powder, stevia leaf, organic burdock root, and organic dandelion root. The taste is mild, only very slightly tasting of pomegranate, tasting mostly just of green tea, with a very pleasant aroma; in fact, it's so mild, that I would definitely use two tea bags and brew it for the full six minutes. It does not get bitter. Unless you enjoy very mild tea, you should plan on getting fewer cups of tea from the box. For this reason I gave this tea only four stars.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Pomegranate Green Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Green Tea Pomegranate helps reinvigorate the body through the neutralization of harmful free radicals. Delicious Pomegranate provides this tea with a powerful dose of natural antioxidants and exciting fruit flavor. This cherished fruit contains polyphenols, chemical compounds that include Epigallo-catechin-3 gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant that is nearly 100 times more potent than vitamin C and 25 times more potent than vitamin E. A favorite of the Mediterranean peoples for centuries, Pomegranate has also been linked to nourishing the skin, supporting healthy cholesterol levels already in the normal range and promoting cardiovascular health. Like Pomegranate, Organic Green Tea also supplies polyphenols that help ward off free radicals. In fact, a single cup of Green Tea has been shown to provide greater antioxidant support than a serving of broccoli, spinach or strawberries. To further complement this healing formula, we've included the detoxifying qualities of Organic Burdock and Organic Dandelion, as well as the gentle essence of Organic Peppermint. Enjoy a cup of refreshing Green Tea Pomegranate and feel renewed with the benefits of nature's most powerful antioxidants."<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Pomegranate Green Tea has contains approximately 30 mg of caffeine per tea bag, which is just one third of what is normally found in an 8 oz cup of coffee.<br /><br />I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting. Recommended.<br /><br />****

review/summary: Nice change of taste and I feel better after a cup!
review/text: I like this green tea. The pomegranate makes for a unique taste and very pretty color also. It contains stevia already so you probably will not need any sweetener added. I have one of these when I feel blah, and the antioxidant properties really do make me feel better. I would give it 5 stars, except I noticed that if I drink it on an empty stomach, I feel a bit queasy. I'm sensitive that way though so it is probably just me, but to make sure I always have a couple of organic crackers first (I recommend Back to Nature crackers). This tea is a definite pantry staple for us.

review/summary: Disappointing Reformulation -- Ingredient List Here Inaccurate
review/text: Yogi Tea's Pomegranate Green Tea has been my favorite tea for years and years, and when my local grocery store stopped carrying this flavor, I started ordering it from Amazon by the case.  It's a good value (cheaper here than at Whole Foods!), but as much as I love this tea, a case of it lasts a long time, and at some point in the months between when I ordered the previous case and my last order, the company sneakily changed the recipe!<br /><br />I thought the flavor was a little off, so I compared the ingredient list on the new box to the list on my last old box, and there was one difference.  Both lists included "pomegranate flavor," but the "powdered pomegranate juice" from the old box's ingredient list (also here on Amazon's ingredient list) is missing from the new box!  (I checked the Yogi Tea website, and their info confirms the change -- there's no more actual pomegranate juice in the tea at all.)  I assume real flavoring from a real food became too expensive...  So disappointing!<br /><br />I loved this tea because it wasn't super-sweet like all the other pomegranate green teas out there.  The tartness of pomegranate showed through the added stevia, and there was just a tiny touch of peppermint tossed in to make the flavor really bright -- it was refreshing iced!  The new formula/recipe is sweeter and flatter in flavor and the tartness is more... harsh.  Perhaps other people will still love it, but if you're here like me looking for your old favorite, consider yourself warned!!

As a long term tea drinker,  and given the benefits of green tea, I've been looking for a green tea I actually liked and this one makes the grade. I will drink this because I like it as opposed to drinking a green tea  only  for the health benefits.  As taste is an individual preference, the only way to know is to try a box and make your own decision.

I ordered many different types of Earth's Best jarred baby foods from Amazon, and unfortunately, the Sweet Potatoes that I received ( April 5 2012 ) were the old stock that contain BPA in the lids. No idea when they'll start shipping the BPA free sweet potato 12 packs, but I won't be ordering these from Amazon for awhile.<br /><br />Note: I spoke with Earth's Best customer service, and they informed me that the lids that have yellow on the bottom side are the ones that contain BPA. The newer, BPA-free jars, which they started switching to mid last year (2011) have a white bottom cap side. FYI, the BPA containing jars had expiration dates of April 2013, whereas my other non-BPA containing jars had expiration dates of fall of 2013, such as November and October.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

It is such a shame really because we love this product and their other baby food offerings (and it's kosher as well!), but now have to search for other products.  In summary, if you care about your child's health, beware that the lid on this item contains BPA and the company rep. as of 12/27/10 said that they do not have plans on changing their packaging.

review/summary: Yummy and Safe
review/text: This has been one of my guys favorites from the start and we are on the 3rd box in month 7 (started him on solids at 5 months)<br /><br />BPA is found in the lids of all jarred baby food due to the canning process. This does mean it makes its way into the food itself. Yummy and safe, fear not.

review/summary: Child's favorite!
review/text: My child loves this baby food. She's been eating it since she was six months old and at close to one she still loves it! We've tried organic sweet potatoes from the store but she doesn't like them.

review/text: I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.

review/summary: This Sweet Potato jar is the favorite of our  7-month old twins
review/text: From the vegetable variety pack, this one is the favorite of our 7-month old twins. I subscribe to the 4 oz. pack of sweet potato with cinnamon.  Cinnamon is supposed to have some benefits such as relieving some of the pain of teething.  That's why I have a subscription for that one.<br /><br />Their next favorite is the carrots.  They love those and I subscribe to the 4 oz carrot baby food as well as some others such as lentils and rice.<br /><br />My wife tasted them. She said the sweet potato one is sweet but not very sweet. But both of our twins won't eat the one with peas despite our best efforts. The one with lentils with brown rice actually has some carrots in it, so I think babies will like that one right away as ours did. With the subscription and considering free delivery, the price is OK. Of course with twins, one has to buy more in bulk.

review/summary: Our favorite veggie
review/text: This is my little guy's favorite veggie by far with the Earth's Best carrots coming in 2nd.  Those are the only 2 veggies that he will continually eat without a fuss but he loves all the fruits we've tried so far.  My husband even tried these and said they tasted just like a sweet potato so I don't understand the negative review either.

review/summary: Baby Loves Sweet Potatoes, Mom Loves Earth's Best
review/text: I buy all of the Earth's Best baby food varieties. Besides cereal, this was my son's first solid food. The first time trying it he ate half the jar and continues to enjoy sweet potatoes by themselves or mixed in other combinations.

review/summary: It tastes like carrots.
review/text: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ER3EFC/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img<br /><br />I don't have a baby, but I am on soft foods for a while after stomach surgery. I ordered some baby foods from Amazon and promptly found out why my babies never would eat baby food. This is supposedly sweet potatoes, but they found a way to remove all the earthy goodness. Before I added salt it tasted like nothing eaten by a human; with salt, it tasted like very mild carrots. I suppose I will eventually use it in baking, but frankly, if it's sweet potatoes I never want to meet the strain of sweet potatoes it came from.

review/text: i keep trying to find this particular one around town and everyone seems to be always out of it. I'm so glad I managed to find it here although I think I may have bought ,more than I bargained for. It will be used most readily so it is not a waste.

review/summary: pleasing and spiritual
review/text: Bought some of this years ago at an Indian festival in town. It has an nice mild strength to it, enough to scent the rooms without being too heavy. I use it for meditation and studying. Had a hard time finding it around town, and ordered it all the way from Bombay for awhile! I've been looking for it again, so I will definitely buy it. (My sister claims it smells like "a good looking man." I guess I could imagine Krishna smelling like this.
