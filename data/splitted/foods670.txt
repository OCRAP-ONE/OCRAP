review/summary: Perfect for long trips
review/text: These bottles are perfect for long trips.  For traveling, they are definitely worth the extra cost over powder because of the added convenience.  We used these on a recent vacation to Hawaii and they were perfect.  We didn't have to mix powdered formula or clean bottles while we were on the plane.  Also, we didn't waste any formula since the bottles are single serving.  Make sure you get several of the nipples that attach directly to the bottle if you are going to be somewhere that you can't wash and reuse them.

review/summary: Great Product...Beware of Allergies
review/text: This is a great all around product. It's great to have the travel bottles handy. They soy formula was also great for my little one at first. It relieved all the discomfort he was having with milk-based formulas. However, after a few days I noticed that he was developing a rash on his body and face which seemed like eczema. I continued to use the product for 2 months since he seemed to really enjoy it and I attributed the rash to excessive heat and/or the detergent we were using. After changing all these variables I switched the formula again and low and behold his rash pretty much completely disappeared in less than 24 hours. So, great product, but just be careful with soy allergies as it may not be obvious right away.

review/summary: Great taste, great ingredients.
review/text: Panettone is a delightful fruity Bread. The dough is very smooth and chewy, sweet and confort. Ideal for tee, coffee and fruity wine (not sour). In some countries like Italy and Brazil they are very traditional specially around the holidays. In Brazil they are traditional as eggnog for us at Christmas. With that said. Bauducco is one of the best in the world, the consistency and texture is just right on this one, (and thats a big deal) hard to find, so if you know how a panettone should taste like, this is the best one for you. We love it. We normally go through 20 from November to New Years eve. I recommend, totally.  : )

I buy several at a time and sometimes have 3 or 4 sitting around the house especially as the season nears its end. We've tried three different kinds, chocolate, one other that we didn't like, and the classic "Panettone Specialty Cake" (26.2 oz) which is our favorite.<br /><br />This product will never end up as French Toast of Bread Pudding in this house - it's just so delicious on its own.

review/summary: Best breadpudding ingredient EVER!
review/text: I love when this stuff comes out in stores every year, because that means I get to make bread pudding!  This bread is incredible for bread pudding, as it has spices and dried fruits already built in.  Just cube up, let sit overnight (or if in a hurry, just use it as-is), and use it as the bread component in a good bread pudding recipe (I recommend one from the Food Network).  This stuff is incredible!  It also makes fantastic stuffing!

review/text: Happened upon this at Vitamin Shoppe the other day and was intrigued by the no sugar / all natural claims on the can. Ever since I started eating organics and staying away from highly processed food items, I've never felt better. So anyway, I had a can of this and felt amazing. I didn't realize it was the Solixir until later in the day, when I realized I had more energy and acuity than usual, which I attributed to the good stuff in the green can. I maintain a pretty routine diet, and am aware of what I eat/how it makes me feel. I could definitely see having a can of this on a saturday morning after a late evening, or after an intense workout, or even before it. I wrote this review because I tracked it down on the internet and found I could purchase it on Amazon. I'm ordering a case right now...!

My taste buds jump with joy as the tingle of bubbles mix with the sparkle of ginger and the tang of pomegranate.  My mouth feels refreshed and clean when I'm done.  What a relief not feeling sugar coating my tongue and teeth.  No sugars or sweeteners (natural or artificial) other than the 30% juice. This has been on my Subscribe and Save list for over a year.  I've had to double my order as friends and family keep grabbing them out of the fridge.

Seriously, this was an awesome drink.<br /><br />For those of you who don't enjoy sweets as much, I would recommend putting half and half. Water helps lower the sugar concentration, and the sweetness, but it doesn't take away the taste, it still taste really good.

review/summary: Extremely delicious-- the best sweet barbecue sauce I've ever had
review/text: I am not a bona fide cook, nor am I a barbecue expert.  Most of my sampling of authentic down-south barbecues has happened on business trips, and I've sampled most of the types of barbecue sauces available at the local grocery stores.  I happened to luck on this one at the grocery store the other day when shopping for something that wouldn't be too spicy for the chillun.  We brought it home that night and used it to dunk pieces of chicken, and I was blown away.<br /><br />I am at a bit of a loss as to how to describe the flavor.  It is sweet and tangy, and slightly spicy but just enough to be pleasant-- I don't think people with even sensitive palates would dislike this sauce.  In a way, though of course they have some different ingredients, this is like a much more refined, more delicious version of the Sweet Chili chicken nugget sauce from McDonald's, which we also like.  (No, this is not the creme de la creme of food connoisseur reviews, but you knew that going in.)<br /><br />The ingredient list on my bottle includes these items in order: water, vinegar, sugar, tomato paste, molasses, and honey, with less than 2% of salt, aged cayenne pepper, natural smoke flavor, modified food starch, dextrose, spice, corn syrup, caramel color, garlic, xanthan gum, onion, sodium benzoate as a preservative, maltodextrin, tamarind, autolyzed yeast extract, and natural flavor.  Ingredients may of course change over time, so make sure to read the ingredients on whatever you buy.<br /><br />I've only used it for dipping, not actual barbecue.  As a grilling sauce I'd say it's ever so slightly on the thinner side of normal, possibly due to vinegar content, but would still work for grilling, especially with extra basting.<br /><br />ETA: During the writing of this review, I had to go heat up some chicken so I could have some of this sauce.

review/text: These gummis are absolutely delish! They are not has hard as the gelatinous gummis but every bit as delicious. They are gelatin-free, made from a sea lettuce which I guess they call "gellan" in the ingredients.<br /><br />My only peeve has to do with the little write-up on the back of the bag, in which they state: they wanted to get rid of the meat gelatin in their sweets and "get rid of all the other stuff that wasn't good".<br /><br />Well, a quick look at the ingredients reveals that the gummis are still made with corn syrup, sugar and modified corn starch as the top three ingredients, lol! so gelatinous meat is not good but sugar is... whatever!<br /><br />the other ingredients are: acidulant, citric acid, gelling agent, gellan, flavors, acidity regulator, trisodium citrate, fruit concentrates, elderberry extract, fructose, invert sugar syrup.<br /><br />These gummis are gelatin free, fat free, dairy free, gluten free, all natural colors and flavors.<br /><br />Since it's mostly sugar, 7 pieces of these peach dreams pack about 121 calories!<br /><br />Anyway, for a nice splurge now and then, I'd take these gummis over the traditional ones any day. My favorite flavor is strawberries and cream--two different flavors in one bag. Yum!

review/text: I'm a big gum chewer but I don't really like the taste of mint, so that limits about 75% of the options out there for me.  I mostly chew fruit flavored gum and have recently enjoyed the other gums in the "Dessert Delights" series, with Orange Cream Pop becoming my go-to choice lately.  I was excited to see this new flavor introduced since I love the taste of actual root beer floats.  I bought a single pack to try it out, and was really impressed!  In my opinion it tastes just like a root beer float (or as much as a stick of gum could) and now I chew it exclusively.  I'm on Amazon today to buy a 10-pack pack, if that says anything about my satisfaction.  I will admit that it doesn't last too long, maybe 5 minutes or so before the flavor starts waning and in 20 minutes you're chewing on flavorless rubber.  However, in my experience most non-mint flavored gums don't last much longer than that anyway.

So while technically our conquistadores are Spanish, for all practical intents and purposes you can consider them Portuguese.<br /><br />Certainly, that's how they taste, and at a price that's lower than you would pay for their cousins just across the border.<br /><br />Furthermore, these fish are presented in a decidedly upscale fashion. As we learn from the back of the carton, "Artisan fishing methods, old master cannery know-how and the highest quality ingredients produce a sardine that is moist, tender, and uncommonly flavorful".<br /><br />In addition, they are "hand packed" and "100 % natural". Lemon in the olive oil adds some welcome zip.<br /><br />After all this my stomach's rumbling. Bring `em on!

review/summary: My dog loves these - they help his teeth stay clean
review/text: I originally started my dog with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WBZ47C">Paragon Hedgehogs</a> - made of the same substance at the toothbrushes, but in a larger form factor - when he was a teething puppy about a year ago.  At that time, he was really slow to finish an entire Hedgehog, but once his adult teeth came in, the thing would be gone in a day and that was way too much dental chew to be ingesting at a time.  Now we give him one toothbrush a day after dinner.  He'll spend half an hour looking for the perfect hiding spot for it and then give in and eat it.  He loves these "toothbrushes" and gets so excited when we give one to him.<br /><br />These treats are made from vegetable starch and have a mild smell like potatoes.  They are currently made in Holland.<br /><br />The "toothbrushes" come in a few sizes. Our pup is 15lbs and we give him the "toothbrushes" from the "small 28ct" bag.<br /><br />The one issue I have with these chews is that they contain titanium dioxide (for coloring) which some studies show is toxic in large quantities.  I'd prefer if they left this ingredient out but unfortunately I've found that nearly every dog chew has something questionable in it.

review/text: Our three dogs love these chews, which we alternate with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CE9I9S">Sam's Yams Big Boyz Sweet Potato Dog Treats, 1-Pound Bag</a>. A daily dose of these chew treats seems to minimize the tartar buildup. We usually feed this medium size to our two 50 pound-ish dogs and the large size to our 65-lb Aussie/Chow mix. We appreciate the all veg, highly digestible ingredients and great chewing action (they're good and chewy, but not hard enough a dog might break a tooth on them), and the fact they're made in Holland, while our dogs seem to appreciate the flavor and gum-massaging action. Be sure to have plenty of fresh water available for your dog, as ours always enjoy a good long drink after finishing their chew treats.<br /><br />This product comes in a variety of sizes, and the sizing information isn't always clear. The "product dimensions" given here describe the size of the PACKAGING, not the product. For clarification, these Paragon medium-sized Star Toothbrushes measure 4" long and 1 1/8th" wide at their widest point (the base of the "handle,") while the large size are 5 1/2" long and 1 1/2" wide at their widest point. I hope that's helpful.

review/summary: Amazing customer service
review/text: When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert "3-4 mm" to inches and consequently discovered the "Coarse Grinder Salt" was almost 1/4" (1/6" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!

review/text: This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a "rounded" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference.

review/summary: For more than salting foods.
review/text: Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet, and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron.

review/summary: super fast shipping, free samples
review/text: placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping; super faster. the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me. in addition, it came with 3 samples (himalayan salt, lemon citron flake salt, and cyprus white flake salt) weighing quite a few grams each (sorry, doesn't say the weight and i don't have a scale with me at the moment).<br /><br />as far as product quality goes, i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods. i haven't tasted it yet, but i bet it tastes like salt. of course price wise this salt (the spice lab) is WAY cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods (even including shipping).

review/text: I have not purchased this from Amazon yet as still on what I purchased elsewhere BUT I noticed many people buying the one pound bag. Just to let you know: one kilo equals 2.2 lbs. Why would you buy the one pound bag on something that never goes bad when you can get more than double for just a few dollars more.<br /><br />Dr. Mercola's comments regarding Himalaya salt benefits are what started me using this initially a few years ago. Many micronutrients, great purity. One person questioned the iodine: no salt naturally contains iodine unless it is iodized or contains some sort of seaweed. You can easily see his comments at mercola.com.<br /><br />Himalaya salt has a very 'clean' taste--add at the end of cooking.

This has a light, mild taste that greatly enhances meats, vegetables, etc.  It's pink/peach color also looks very pretty in my clear Cole/Mason grinder.  It grinds very finely with no issue.  In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.  If you're a neat freak, this might bug you a little and you might find yourself wiping out the top of the grinder.  Great salt and the bag lasts a long time.

Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon).

The salt is very high quality and a beautiful pink color.<br />Due to my miscalculation, I ordered crystals that were too big for my grinder.<br />I sent a note and asked if I could exchange it for smaller crystals.<br />Customer service answered quickly and said "They were sending me a bag of smaller crystals" completely free.<br />How wonderful of them!!!<br />You don't see that very often these days. I commend Spice Lab for having such wonderful "customer service!" I am now a dedicated customer!!! Thank you Spice Lab for my quality salt!! I am going to make "Sole" and cook with it every day!!!

review/summary: SALT OF THE EARTH - Himalayan Style
review/text: Silly me, I didn't even know there was such a thing as pink Himalayan salt.  A friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style.  So now, it's like buying a red, Ford Mustang.  It's all you see on the road or, in this case, on the shelves of the stores.<br /><br />I'm actually glad I purchased this and have stopped using regular old white salt almost totally.  The salt does seem to have a milder taste but I don't find myself using any more of it than I did with the good old "when it rains it pours" variety.<br /><br />Since ordering this from Amazon, I've managed to find some here in my little town but it is way expensive.  When you purchase this you will also need a salt grinder unless you like throwing big chunks of salt at your food.  Worth getting the two together, however, especially if you purchase a grinder with a glass container as the salt really looks attractive in a pretty, transparent grinder.  And, of course, it tastes good, too.  About it's nutritional value I admit to knowing zip.  Does salt HAVE nutritional value?  In the meantime, I give this four stars.  If I find out more about the actual food value I'll update this review.

review/summary: Great mild hot sauce - outrageous price!
review/text: I agree with the other reviewer.  Down at my local grocery store, a can of this sauce is 69 cents, but if you watch for a sale, you can get them 2/$1.  This is, however, an excellent, mild hot sauce for folks who want a bit of heat on their tacos or tostadas, but have taste buds too sensitive for the fiery sauces that are out there.  I've used this sauce for the last 25 years, and love it!

review/text: I really like this brand of cheese sticks. They have great flavor, not an overwhelming 'chemical cheese' taste, and they don't rely on a ton of salt as do so many other snacks like these. Unfortunately, they came from "Warehouse Deals". They are packed by the manufacturer in a box of 12 designed for transport on pallets in semis to stores. That means the manufacturer's packaging is not designed to have a label stuck on it and then be tossed around by UPS, or FedEx, or whomever is delivering it. I received twelve boxes of cheese stick crumbs!!!! DO NOT ORDER IF "Warehouse Deals" is the vendor!!!!!!

review/text: I've tried to find a good chocolate covered sunflower seeds for so long - I had them when I was young and couldnt find it in the US that easily. The Chocolate covered sunflower seeds from Yankee traders taste really good. The chocolate itself is really good. I can taste sunflower seeds in there but some of my coworker said they couldnt really tell (hance the 4 stars), I guess becasue they are not used to the sunflower seeds taste. I have to put just a little of it next to me or I'll probably eat the whole bag in a few days. Thank you!

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I have been a sardine eater for years and I love my boneless skinless. I have tried a million brands and variations. I have learned a few things.<br /><br />All sardines in this shape tin are from morocco and from the same plants. They are the same exact sardines in seasons, king oscar, etc; so its all about finding the lowest price brand and seller. I fully endorse these sardines and this seller as being an excellent example of service and quality goods. I ordered on friday and got them monday morning with free shipping option.<br /><br />These are boneless and skinless as specified with very minimal salt added. The fish was fresh even for my ridiculous standards, the olive oil was of good quality with the fish very well marinated, and the oil goes good with cooking or with good french bread and balsamic vinegar.

review/text: What a pleasure to have found truly skinless and boneless sardines with a great, delicate flavor -- and in LIGHT olive oil.  Delicious.  Much better than supermarket brands which are often too strong in taste and scent.  I've saved some money by subscribing to delivery every other month, but may have to increase it to monthly. Cento is a good brand -- their tuna is delicious, too.

review/summary: Best sardines and great value!
review/text: I've tried myriad of different brands, the last one being Crown Prince which were floating in oil, literally. Not much of a meal unless you consider drinking that olive oil filling. The cans arrived a bit dirty so make sure to wash them before opening. The package it arrived in looked like it's been sitting on a shelf for ages, but the actual sardines are very good!! The can is packed, I'd say 6-8 sardines and a lot less oil. Still enough to pour over salad. They don't taste fishy, unlike the Season's brand, and are salty enough to no need for additional salt. Just a splash of lemon and voila...delicious over salad greens or with a boiled egg for breakfast. This one is a keeper and I'll be ordering more soon.

review/summary: These are great but the can sux
review/text: I've tried a bunch of different sardines from Amazon and these are the best I've tried though I haven't tried any of the more expensive ones. Nice taste and the texture is very good. The texture is what I hate about sardines packed in water. These are well worth the cost. I had one box with a problem with the can. The first box was fine but on the second box of these and for every can in that box the pull ring popped off and I had to open the can with my pocket knife which isn't easy once the ring is gone. I found that you just have to punch through the opening seam right in front of the ring then they open fine. Kind of messy though. So if you take these to work like I do be sure and have a secondary way to open the can just in case.<br /><br />Edit: I still say these are the best for the price but I have found some sardines I like a good bit better, Bela sardines.  However they are more expensive at $4 a can from Amazon but I found them for $3 locally.

review/summary: delivered damaged, amazon making good
review/text: Package arrived stamped "received in damaged condition" or something to that effect.  So Amazon recieved it from a third party, Cento Fine Foods, damaged and clearly leaking sardine oil, and delivered it to me anyhow.  What's up with that?  Upon opening, I found one of the 25 cans smashed - think pureed sardines all over the other cans - and 4 more cans badly dented.  So I really received 20 cans for the price of 25.  I hope they're reeaalllly tasty.  I guess it's better to avoid purchasing some things online.<br />UPDATE - Amazon rocks!  I have been told that they will be replacing damaged cans. (Hope they arrive in one piece)<br /><br />UPDATE 2-<br />Seller replaced my sardines!! I will certainly order them again knowing seller will replace broken cans.  Why can't I update my rating to 5?

I read other reviews about the can top breaking so I have always just been careful when opening them and had no problems yet.  I even feed the extra oil to my dog, he loves it!  Very similar to tuna in taste, not overly fishy probably because no skin.  A good buy at this price & I will do it again.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I am a sardine lover from way back, but have to eat them sparingly as my wife often threatens to throw me out of the house if I eat them when she's home.  However, in a fit of weakness and husbandly sneakiness I ordered these based on the previous Amazon reviews.  They are just as good as I had hoped - a very mild, pleasant flavor, firm flesh and excellent olive oil.  They are a little less salty than most sardines I have tried, which is good or bad depending on what you prefer.  If you prefer a very intense, smokey sardine flavor, these ones probably aren't for you.  They are excellent dumped on top of a salad, with no salad dressing necessary.  Most of the cans have been packed tightly with fish and just the right amount of oil.  And, wonder of wonders, even my wife has deemed them worthy of human consumption.<br /><br />I know other reviewers had some issues with the packaging or opening the cans.  These arrived in good condition, and all of the cans so far have opened perfectly.  I would definitely recommend them and plan on ordering more when this case runs out.

review/text: Not a good soup for the microwave.  Something in the soup or in the container design causes the soup to explode (top flies off and soup everywhere) or causes the container to jump around like a Mexican jumping bean, many times landing on it's side and draining cold soup throughout the microwave. I have tried in different brands of microwave and experienced the same issues.  I place container on paper plate, and cover container with many sheets of paper towel.  Sometimes this contains the mess, but often the force of the explosion will throw paper towels to the side and the eruption coats the inside of the microwave.

review/text: They are so hard to find in the local supermarkets by my house! I came across them at Bakers, and I'm glad I did. Although these aren't the healthiest snacks in the bunch, my taste buds are what matter. These are the best! It's soft, but crispy frosted breading with a big, fluffy chocolate pudding pile inside. They are totally worth the price and I would eat them everyday if I could. I don't know what the idiotic person who gave it a 1-star review was smoking, but this is so great tasting and sure as heck could be even unhealthier. It's not that bad if you only have 2 or so a week. The good thing about them is it has a good source of fiber and dome different vitamins. I have loved these all my life, and that won't change. I about melted when I took my first bite. I could've ate the pack of 5 in a day! You won't regret buying these if you like frosting and chocolaty pudding that tastes a little like fudge. If I could give them any higher of a star, trust me I would!

review/text: This product is great for using in any lasagna - even those who are not gluten-free cannot tell the difference between this and normal pasta. The only drawback here is that it does take it about 45 minutes or longer to cook fully in the oven. I usually boil mine for a little bit to cut down on the cooking time in the oven. This pasta is really great about not falling apart while cooking or handling which is a huge plus. Love it - a must have for the gluten-free!

I now get an auto-shipped case every three months and the price and convenience can't be beat.

It goes together quickly, then pop it in the oven for 45 minutes and it's done.  Going through a case from Amazon is not a problem at all, and as soon as they offer it again with free shipping, I'll be buying more!  I never have liked the taste of whole wheat pasta, and this whole grain rice pasta tastes so much better.  We like the taste better if I greatly decrease or omit the salt that I used to add to my lasagna recipe.

review/summary: Great pasta
review/text: My daughter is gluten free, but our entire family likes this pasta.  My husband claims it is not as heavy feeling as some pasta is.  Even my picky teenager likes it.  The fact that you don't have to boil it is a plus.  The first two times I used it, I was worried that it would not cook through, but that was not an issue at all. You can't go wrong with this product.
