review/text: I am totally addicted to this! i drink it every morning when i wake up and usually have one cup after dinner, . Bergamot is supposed to have properties that aid in digestion and calm your stomach, which i believe in. I have tried severl other brands but none even come close to the quality of stash.

review/summary: stash double bergamot tea
review/text: Bought this at a public store a few years ago but couldn't find it again.  Went to another brand from England and they stopped exporting it.  If you love bergamot then this is for you.  Full taste and bold.  Was thrilled when my daughter told me to look at Amazon.  And there it was.  So much better than any other earl greys.

review/text: Stash has some of the best black teas on the market and their English Breakfast tea is one of them.  I nice hot cup of this tea first thing in the morning is a great way to start your day.  I really like the individual packaging of the tea bags and ofter tuck a couple of packages in my purse in case a restaurant does not have this tea.<br /><br />I have tried some other teas and have found that some leave a slight, bitter aftertaste and Stash's does not do this.  Very nice flavor and I leave the teabag in the cup the whole time I am drinking it.  Not too strong and not to light.

review/text: This is as close to Earl Grey perfection as one can hope from a tea bag, and at ~$.13/ea, an incredible value. For those who take no issue with tea in a bag, Stash's double-bergamot offering provides a balance of floral, citrus, and earthy notes without being overly tannic or bitter. If you're in the US and you've been looking for a substitute for Harrods, this is it.

review/text: I think it's like another reviewer said, it really lacks a good black tea body. I love the intense spiciness, but clove dominates. In fact, the clove is so intense, that it numbs my mouth half way through a cup. I don't mind because it reminds me of when I used to smoke kretek, but others might.

review/text: Our family found Stash's Double Bergamot in a grocery store, tried it, loved it --and lost it.  Seems stores have limited shelf space and rarely carry "specialty" items like the Double Bergamot Earl Grey.  If you like Earl Grey, you will adore the Earl with Double Bergamot.  Very distinctive flavor.  Unique!  Thankfully Amazon sells the six-pack of this special tea, which we get on automatic delivery so we never run out.  Priced better than the local stores.

review/text: I really like other flavors of Stash (peach, lemongrass green and breakfast blend).  But, this has two types of cloves which I knew weren't my favorite but it also had cardomon oil which is my favorite spice.  But the cloves overpower everything else.  Numi golden chai has no cloves whatsoever so I recommend it if you want to avoid those pesky cloves.  Oh, Numi also does not have black pepper which is traditional in chai tea but is also a taste I don't like in my tea.

review/summary: About the best Earl Grey Tea I've found
review/text: Since I first tasted Stash brand Earl Grey tea, I have not purchased any other brand of Earl Grey.  The other brands I've tried just don't taste as good and are not quite the same.  This tea is flavored with oil of bergamot, rather than just "scented" with it, as as some labels say on other brands of Earl Grey tea.  I'm not sure what the difference is, unless that maybe Stash just uses more of the bergamot in their recipe.  But whatever the difference is, it works!<br /><br />For an added treat, also try the Stash "double bergamot" Earl Grey tea.  I highly recommend both, and I regularly drink both.

review/summary: An enjoyable way to start the day
review/text: I drank the regular strength Stash Chai for more than a year, and I liked it very much, although I always found myself wishing for a spicier version. When I learned that Stash also makes a Double Spice Chai I picked up a box of it at a local coffee/tea shop and decided it was actually closer to my preferences. When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product. Nevertheless, I am still generally content with my Double Chai and am continuing to enjoy my morning brew of it.

review/text: This tea is delicious with milk. The description on the website says to brew for 3-5 minutes. While this is a normal instruction for black tea, it will not produce the best chai. Because chai contains lots of spices, like other spicy things, it is better if the spices have the opportunity to mellow out. Basically, the longer you leave it, the better it gets. You can leave it over night or as long as you want. If it is cold, just put it in the microwave or reheat on the stove to bring it up to your preferred temperature.<br /><br />The decaf version with milk makes a lovely bedtime drink.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG8M6">Stash Decaf Chai Spice Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: How this tea could get any stars is beyond me.  I tried one bag and could not taste anything...you got it nothing.  So next I used two bags in a cup to see if that improved the taste...still no taste.  At my age I will not waste time on useless things so I gave the rest of my order to a friend who also enjoys Earl Grey Tea without my comment.  The next day she asked if I wanted my tea back saying it was the worse tea ever!!!<br />I will bet they do not publish this review but hope they will.<br />Do not buy this tea.

review/summary: Rustichella Makes Great Pasta ...
review/text: ... but it would be desecration to put this gunk on any decent pasta, let alone Rustichella's. Jarred pesto is to freshly-made pesto as instant coffee is to freshly-brewed mocha-java from Peet's. I've been silly enough to try various brands of pesto in jars, and none of them would glean more than two stars. The frozen brands are marginally better, but the only justification for store-shelf pesto is the unavailability of fresh basil, Even then, you'd do better to make a pesto recipe with any soft herb you have: arugula, dandelion, parsley, mashed artichoke ... if I lived in Nunavut I'd probably use lichen from the belly of a caribou rather than depend on jarred pesto.<br /><br />Here's a basic pesto recipe for a small batch:<br /><br />50g of basil leaves<br />Extra virgin olive oil<br />6 Tbsp grated Parmigiano Reggiano or Grana Padano<br />2 Tbsp Pecorino (romano, toscano, sardo or siciliano)<br />2 cloves of garlic<br />1 Tbsp pine nuts<br />Coarse sea salt<br />The traditional method uses a wooden pestle and a marble mortar. Start by pounding the garlic and salt until you get a smooth paste.<br />Add the basil, a handful at a time, and keep grinding until each batch of the leaves is incorporated. To preserve the essential oils in the basil, don't be too rough with it.<br />Add the pine nuts and grind some more.<br />Add the cheese and mix well.<br />Add the oil, little by little, until the pesto has the right consistency - a matter of taste.<br />Serve with pasta or added to minestrone. The recommended pastas are troffie, trofiette or trenette, but it goes with just about any pasta. I usually serve it with spaghetti or linguine.<br /><br />If somebody has an interesting variation, post it as a comment.

review/summary: Great snack for a low carb diet - only 80 Cal.
review/text: I am fat, but I'm currently trying to change that. Not being a body builder I wondered if this product was for me, and I was very happy with the results. I keep these with me on days that I can't prepare a meal or when I am tired of my diet food and want something that has a little more hearty flavor. Caveat is: just like turkey-jerky, if you didn't know you were eating ostrich you might think that it tastes a bit different. Keep in mind that ostrich tastes more like chicken than beef.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Compact (will fit in cargo pocket)<br />Tasty<br />Fairly low salt<br />Semi-Moist (good or bad depending on your taste)<br />80 calories<br />Great for diets<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Hard to open sometimes<br />A bit large to fit in pocket (won't fit in standard pants pocket)<br />Co-workers think you are weird to eat Ostrich<br />A little expensive<br /><br />So, with all that said, I keep a box of these in my cupboard at all times just in case I need a snack and I don't want to go off-diet. Buy a box and see what you think.

review/summary: Tasty source of protein
review/text: I didn't order these snack sticks from Amazon, but decided to give my review anyway. I'm required to get 60 grams of protein per day, so I have to be resourceful. I thought I'd try these sticks based on the many positive reviews. At first I was reluctant to eat them because of them being made from ostrich, but I couldn't taste anything different in them. They are delicious! They remind me of Slim Jim's but a lot better. They're not greasy and they're thicker. They are a bit difficult to chew, so be careful about that. Also, they're very filling. I could only eat half a stick at a time. I highly recommend this low-cal, high protein snack.

Natural Balance now has a very similar limited ingredient, duck and sweet potato product, but for some reason, that one makes the dog's stomach run.  The biggest cons with this product is price and availability.

Make sure you do NOT use a non stick pan.  Make sure it is very HOT before placing 1 TBS of Amaranth in the pan.  If it doesn't pop immediately your pan isn't hot enough.  Immediately remove your pan from the stove and shake shake shake so it doesn't burn.  Very tasty treat.  Keep in mind alot of the seeds won't pop but they are still very tasty.

review/text: I also purchased this at World Market. It is great over cottage cheese. yogurt. ricotto, mixed with fresh fruit or over berries. Not a coffee drinker, but was told about this in my weight management group.Most of us use the Torani sugar free syrups now. No salty taste, no funny after taste. Highly recommend!

I make a double espresso shot and make ice coffee with it, add a little of the salted caramel and it is as good as any ice coffee i have tryed(including dunkin donuts).

review/summary: Excellent for breading!
review/text: I use this product for breading anything from pork chops to fish.  I mix it with parmesan, which drops the carb count (my husband had type 2 diabetes), and dried italian herbs and it makes a great alternative to bread crumbs.  We also feel like we are having a treat whilst still eating healthfully and on top of all that, it keeps the meat/fish etc moist!!

review/summary: Very good baking mix
review/text: I am very pleased with my order of Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Baking Mix.  I love the 16 oz packages.  They are small enough to use up one at a time while the other packages remain unopened (also easier to store).  The flavor is also great, and I can make quite a few recipes with it. My favorite recipe being the low carb pancakes, the recipe is right on the package.  The absolute BEST reason I love this baking mix is the fact that it has 5 g fiber per 1/4 cup.  0 trans fat and 0 sugar.  Try it, you won't be sorry!

review/text: At first I substituted only a dash, perhaps 1:5 (Bob's Red Mill Baking Mix:Flour) in a recipe. I was worried the mix would change the outcome. Now, unless making something like a light fluffy cake, I make a 100% substitution. Great for casseroles, corn bread, home made granola bars (my repetoire). Great purchase.

review/text: As a type II diabetic, I've missed sweets most. This low carb baking mix has opened up a whole new world of creativity. I do use this 100% in place of regular flour with excellent results. I even managed to make blonde brownies (using DiabetiSweet brown sugar substitute) that turned out moist and chewy (with about 40 gr net carbs per 8" pan). No special recipes required. Have also tried muffins and quick breads and plan on trying some of my old cookie recipes. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Great product; great nutrition
review/text: Bob's Red Mill products are all good but this one is really special.  Zone dieters (and low carb dieters in general) really struggle to add old favorites to their menu ... especially baked goods.  Bob's Red Mill baking mix is very much like Bisquick, but without the poor nutritional stats that Bisquick brings with it.  Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Baking Mix enables us to make pancakes, waffles, muffins, etc., etc. that are "Zone friendly" so we can stay "in the zone" and still eat many of the things we were missing while on the Zone program (which, if you haven't tried and want to improve your nutrition or lose weight, you really should!).  Thank you Bob's Red Mill for another great product!

review/summary: Grossly Understated Carb Count
review/text: Not only does this baking mix contain fructose and turbinado sugar (where is the 'low carb' in those?), it tastes horrible. It is bitter with a very strange texture.<br /><br />The recipes are easy to make, but the results are less than appetizing. It was definitely a mistake on my part to order this on Amazon, since I was only able to purchase in bulk.<br /><br />This is definitely something to avoid if you have Type 1 diabetes. The carbohydrate count is grossly understated and will shoot your blood glucose numbers through the roof.

review/summary: Not loving it
review/text: I was so excited to find this Low-Carb Baking Mix and I thought that it would be of the same quality as all the other Bob's Red Mill products I've used.  Unfortunately that is not the case.  I've used it in several low carb baking recipes and it smells and tastes like FISH.  (Or is it soy, as others have mentioned?)  I don't know, but this product makes awful baked goods and the unfortunate smell and taste overpowers any other flavoring you may have in the recipe.  I imagine it must be a good coating for fish though.<br />I'm sorry I purchased this in bulk as well, as I feel bad about wasting money and food. This is not a keeper.

review/summary: You Can Have Mine!
review/text: I bought this to use in baking. As a low-carber of many years, I have learned to use several dry ingredients together to take the place of plain flour. Even though I only use this as part of the dry ingredient mix, the soy taste is still prevalent in the end result. I now add just a tablespoon or so to my baked goods just so that I can use it up, but I will never buy it again. Everything else I have used from Bob's Red Mill has been very good, so I had higher hopes for this product.

review/summary: Good for Low Carbers
review/text: I tried this product because I can no longer find (they must no longer make) the Atkins brand of low carb bake mix.  I actually do not like the consistency of this product as much, but the taste is very good and if I had not used another bake mix, the consistency would not have bothered me.  I would recommend this for anyone on a low carb diet.  We use it in pancakes mostly but also to bread chicken tenders when I occasinally fry them.  I did not like only using this for pancakes.  We tried the recipe on the bag and it was not the best.

review/summary: Good for heartier baked items
review/text: I'm a carb counter; I wanted this mix so that I could make things like strawberry shortcake biscuits, banana bread, and oatmeal cookies with Splenda. The first batch of oatmeal cookies turned out a little dry, but are otherwise rather tasty--and better than no oatmeal cookie at all. I made farmhouse oatmeal cookies, the kind with no brown sugar but made with soured milk. The strawberry shortcake biscuits turned out fine as well. Splenda works great with mashed strawberries. I haven't yet tried this mix with banana bread but I expect it will turn out well. Using this mix and Splenda, the carb count is quite low. I wouldn't recommend this mix to replace any white flour mix and expect the same results. But for heartier items, it works well.

review/summary: Great for SBD treats!
review/text: My family recently switched to the SBD lower carb lifestyle with great success. While other reviewers have said this isn't good for low-carb diets, I beg to differ. If you are doing NO CARBS then sure, there really isn't a whole grain for you. But if you are doing GOOD CARBS and low carbs then this is fantastic! My family loves pancakes, so I was excited to find this as an option. About once or twice each month I make pancakes with this and they are AWESOME. We always add some cinnamon and sometimes we add mashed bananas or NSA applesauce instead of oil. It's a treat with sugar-free syrup, of course, but it's a far healthier treat than a Bisquick pancake. I have no idea what anyone means about fish or soy taste in the other reviews. Perhaps they aren't seasoning the mix when using it for breading or baking. Even my super picky husband asks me to bake him pancakes with this!

review/summary: Contains fructose and torbinado sugar
review/text: Not sure how this can fall into the low carb camp when it's got crystalline fructose and torbinado sugar in the ingredients.  I guess I don't consider 6 net grams of sugars to be low carb...but you may think otherwise. We all have different limits.<br /><br />I know, some claim that torbinado sugar is "better" for you because it's less processed, but that's like saying Gin is better for your liver than Everclear because it's distilled less.  Both have a serious impact on your liver.  Likewise, sugar and torbinado sugar have a serious impact on your body over time.  Sure, this tastes pretty darned good compared to other low carb brands, but in my opinion, that's because it's got more tasty sugar.  The impact on my insulin after eating this is significant enough that I can't have it.  Just beware of that.<br /><br />Lastly, I wish more food vendors would pay attention to sugars and wheats.  There's getting to be a growing body of evidence that sugars (fructose especially) and wheat products are what's leading western countries into obesity and cancer.  You can check out eatingacademy dotcom for the science behind it.

review/summary: Tasty and Low-Carb
review/text: I read the ingredients and this is a nutritious and high fiber product. As expected the muffins and pancakes are not light and fluffy, but that's due to not being a refined flour. I find this to be exactly what I expected and easy to bake with (just be sure you have baking powder on hand). I've experimented with the muffins and find them to be the density of the bran muffins you might find at the store. There is a grainy undertaste but it's not a bad taste--just not white flour. I will use this product again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a healthier baking product or who is trying to eat a lower carb diet (it's good for diabetics too).

review/text: Have been successfully eating Atkins/low-carb for the past few years so appreciate products that allow  me to "go grain" occasionally without going off the dietary reservation. Also can use this product to serve friends who are not so hard-core in their eating habits, sometimes adding a portion of regular or almond flour to a recipe. This Red Mill product differs from specific Atkins mixes in the "whole grain" feature so it depends on the high fiber to provide low net carbs. Experimenting has shown me that a little extra egg can help produce the best texture; don't skimp on the leavening!

review/text: If you are actually a low-carber, you probably want to avoid this product.  Read the ingredients list.... it just is not low-carb. All the reviews that say that they like the taste are not for you.  If taste was the only criteria that matters, that would be different.  But low-carbers make choices first based on whether the food fits their way of eating and only second on how it tastes.<br /><br />If you are just avoiding "whites" because of diabetes or other health concerns, this may work for you and is a definite improvement over Bisquick.
