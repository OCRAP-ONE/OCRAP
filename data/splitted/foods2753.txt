review/summary: Best Iced Tea Ever!
review/text: I love this tea.  We use it with an automatic iced tea maker (4 tsp. to a basket) and it's perfect.  You can use the whole individual packet if you want to, but it's a waste of tea.  We open the individual packets and store the tea in an air tight container to keep it fresh.  China Mist makes other flavors too, which are great.  We often mix another flavor with the black tea and it's wonderfully refreshing.  Once you've had this you will never go back to Lipton!

review/summary: Great tea
review/text: Love this tea,  Our neighbor introduced us to it a month ago.  And we fell in love with it.  Now this tea is packaged in plastic in portion sizes, so you have to use a filter or strainer over your vessel.  But this is a commercial product and I'm using it at home.  it makes approx. 2 gals but we brew in a 1 gal container. So after brewing, before serving we cut the tea by 100% or we would be climbing the walls.... but that's fine.....  we love the stuff.  No after taste, and very clean taste.  And buying in bulk size like this we're saving money on a very fine product.......

Of course, the whole "melt in your mouth, not in your hand" thing, a lie.  But a catchy lie.<br /><br />I like the candies but stopped buying them when my son was a year old because he almost choked on one.  Now that he's 19... well, it's time to return to my favorites!  Ok, I could've returned earlier, I'm pretty sure he knows to chew his food now.  M&Ms are a good old standard for the candy bowl!  Hardly worth buying online, unfortunately, considering the shipping charges, but if you can find free shipping or get a deal on that, go for it.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/summary: Favorite Green Chai
review/text: This is my favorite Chai flavored tea. I know that's an immense claim but I've tried a lot of Chai and this one is incredibly good. Its green (not black, oxidized), its organic, and not full of artificial "stuff." You can taste the quality and the care that went into formulating it. Our favorite way to prepare it has been iced plain, but people can add milk, honey, sweeteners, or pie spices if they want and I'm sure it'd be great.<br /><br />The best part though, is the "Shepherd's" scripture. All of the verses are KJV, and extremely well chosen. It would make a great pair for a Bible study, devotional, meetings, personal time, or to give as gifts. This is truly a special one. Everyone I've shared it with has been ecstatic.

review/summary: Santa's House & Toy Shop
review/text: I have been buying Gingerbread house kits for several years at Costco and have always been happy with them. This year they changed the style to the one I'm commenting on. I was disappointed with the Santa's House & Toy Shop. I bought two kits and both had broken pieces that I had to glue together before I could even begin to assemble them, not to mention the candy canes that were obviously broken before they were even packed in the kit.  Also, the pre-printed sides were backwards, leaving me to have one rough side exposed with the windows facing inward. I guess I was spoiled with the previous kits I've bought, never a problem with any of them. I usually buy three kits every year. I assemble them before Thanksgiving and as part of our Thanksgiving day tradition my three grandchildren decorate them.<br />Regardless of the quality of the kit, the kids enjoyed them which is all that<br />really matters.

review/summary: Quick, light Brown Sauce good for on the GO!
review/text: My family and I travel frequently, and being a retired Chef, I still like to eat well, even on the go! We, my wife, and our twin son and daughter, travel and usually stay in nice "hotel" rooms WITH kitchens. So, preparing "scratch" sauces on the road is not convenient. With the Knorr Demi Glace, I can cook up a quick light brown gravy, or an elegant light brown sauce easily with this "instant" sauce mix. One can use this, to add flavor to everything from Chili, to Stoganoff, and many other dishes.<br /><br />No, it won't replace the freshly scratch made Demi Glace. Nevertheless, it is a great QUICK substitute, and is also easily to convert into several different sauces with other ingredients.

review/summary: EXPIRED FOOD PRODUCT - DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM
review/text: We purchased this product through Amazon and received it promptly on May 16, 2012.  When it arrived, we looked everywhere on the canisters to find the expiration date.  None was visible, so we thought perhaps the date was contained within the coding numbers on the bottom of the canisters, but the information was indecipherable to us.  We called Knorr Swiss directly for assistance.  We were told that KNORR SWISS DISCOUNTINUED THIS PRODUCT IN 2004, and since the maximum expiration date on these sauces is 2 years past the manufacture date, they were seriously expired, and we were told that under no circumstances should this product be used for food preparation.  We logged onto our Amazon account to return the product, but were told the product was not eligible for return.  We then contacted Amazon by phone and, as usual, they were extremely gracious and co-operative.  They confirmed that grocery items are not eligible for return, but immediately processed a full refund for the amount of the purchase to our credit card account.  Amazon assured me they would deal with the vendor on this issue, and I trust that they will.  In the meantime, be aware that this is not a safe food product.  The only reason I gave this even 1 star, is that the product review format will not allow for 0 stars.

review/summary: A truly all-purpose mix
review/text: This stuff is a great shortcut for a light, rich brown sauce.  Not a heavy thick gravy, but a rich glaze.  It's beefy, but there are definite vegetable flavors that shine through.  A spoonful of it adds a wonderful roundness to any beef recipes that have a sauce or gravy, or a spoonful can make an instant pan sauce with some drippings.  I like to use it as a base for a marsala sauce, or a carmelized onion sauce for sauteed pork chops, since it's not as heavy as a gravy.  You can do way more than just the standard sauce directions.

review/text: Every time I ordered black garlic before it came in bags rather than a tub and wasn't that fresh. By that I mean the cloves were not like I had when I was in China; they were firm and not as flavorful from U.S. companies trying to replicate it.  This was either due to the shipping in a cheap bag or due to not fermenting for long enough but I can only guess which.<br /><br />This shipped in a tub and was super fresh. It was really flavorful and the texture I remembered. It was that perfect mix that tasted like a cross between a balsamic reduction and worcestershire sauce.<br /><br />Better yet, there was nothing to peel so the container weight ONLY included what we ate making it a better buy .<br /><br />My dad saw it on Dr. Oz to lower cholesterol but we just love the taste in stir frys and in Italian food.  It's a very pretty garnish too rather than using the typical green things like parsley; sprinkle chopped black garlic on top of dishes and everyone loves the taste but can't figure out what it is. It's not at all bitter like white garlic.  It's really sweet and savory as well.

review/text: I've used this wonderful soup mix for several years.  Today I went to get some in the only store in town that I know sells it, and they weren't carrying it anymore!  I'm so glad I found it on Amazon.  I usually "doctor" it up as follows:  Make two packets at a time.  White it's cooking add a few red potatoes, sliced very thin, a can of whole-kernel corn, and a 10-ounce package of frozen spinach.  Cook long enough to make sure the potatoes are done.  Even if you don't add these extra ingredients, it's a good idea to cook the soup a little while longer than the directions state; otherwise, the garbanzos won't be soft.

review/summary: Best Flavors from Variety Pack - and Best Popcorn Type
review/text: I wanted to have "sized" portions of chip-type product that would be tasty and filling.  I tried at least 6 different brands of popcorn-type snack packages (unfortunately, most came in 24-36 item packages).  After receiving the first 5 brands, I felt they were total waste of money.... 2 had texture of light styrofoam peanuts, with almost no flavor.  A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.

I add one package of Splenda, which really brings out the ginger flavor. It's great hot or iced. I wish it didn't have calories! Hey Ginger People, how about a lite version? I appreciate not having to go out to BevMo (which isn't on my beaten path). Thanks for the Free SuperSaver Shipping Amazon! The only problem is I had to find a place to store the 12 bottles. But they don't stay stored for long!<br /><br />This is an update for my previously 5 star review. Several months ago, I realized the drink tasted different, with a stronger ginger flavor, which is too strong for me. I confirmed that the formula had been changed by writing to The Ginger People, who told me that the formula was revised to provide more benefits from the ginger, and suggested diluting the drink with water to make the flavor more palatable to me. I do this, as well as add two additional Splendas, and it is better, but not as good as it used to be. A benefit of diluting the drink is I am lowering the calorie count a little. But I no longer drink this as just a thirst quenching, cold, non-carbonated beverage, but only when I need it for an upset stomach. So I'm knocking off one star for taste. It's just not as tasty as it used to be.

review/text: I have been making wine for several years and purchased mainly Wine Expert kits. I ordered one of these to try after making the Barlo kit. This kit suprised me on how it turned out. Granted its not a $15 bottle of wine but, it is enjoyable. My son thinks this is the best one I have made yet. After looking at the reviews I ordered a Chardonnay to try also.

review/summary: First with this kit
review/text: Got this kit to try, nicely priced so went for it.  It's easy, good directions.  I did find that it took some major degassing, and be careful with that because it can spew right out of the carboy. This wine has the gas!  I took an extra couple of days for this process.  I topped it off (head top) for the last weeks with a niagra to give it a bit of sweet, and I did add a wine conditioner...it is mostly for gifts so I went sweeter.  It does have a bite at bottle, but I expect that to grow sweeter by Christmas.  All in all it's quite ok to drink at finish if you are a bit on the dry side.  A point that may interest, I had a duh moment when starting this wine. I forgot to add the benonite.  It cleared on it's own beautifully with a few extra weeks.  It seems goof proof.  I'd say buy it if you like a nice white, no frills kind of wine to chill on that spur of the moment.  I am pretty sold on these kits for the price. They are not the pinky up thing, but with a tweek or 2, or not, they are a nice budget wine.

review/summary: Great Value
review/text: I added sugar to get the SG up to 1.085 and used a cotes de blanc yeast from Red Star. Whipped the gas off a  couple times durring secondary and at SG 0.990 I degassed and cleared it per the instructions.  It seamed a little thin so I added two 12 oz cans of Welches frozen white grape.  This was my sweetener and 'body' filler as it were.<br /><br />A month after bottling this was pretty good.  I don't love Guweruztraminer but was looking for a base to make a semi sweet green chili wine after the 'Hatch Green Chili' spirit.  The Green Chili is good too but the base has become a decent white table wine.<br /><br />For $40 for 6 gallons you cant complain even a little on this one, though I'd rate it at $7-$9/bottle.  That's $170 bucks to the good on 30 bottles at the least.  So add a little juice to get the body up and a little sugar to get the alcohol up and you have a pretty decent table wine to serve.  I bet the guys making 5 gallon batches are right on as the kit by itself would make a thin wine.<br /><br />Very tasty and easy to drink.  It may 4 vs 5 stars based on my indifference to Gewurztraminer.

review/summary: I've had (and made) better Gewurztramainer
review/text: I would say this kit is "okay."  Drinkable, but I wouldn't purchase this kit again.<br /><br />Positives: Easy kit to make, labels are decent, corks were acceptable.<br /><br />Negatives:  You HAVE to add wine conditioner to sweeten up this wine.  Of course the kit omits this key ingredient, and says it is something "optional" you can do.  My wife and I both enjoy this type of wine, and have had at least 15 different commercial brands over the years + another we made ourselves a couple years ago (can't recall what kit that was from).  Without the conditioner, it DOES NOT taste like a proper Gewurztraminer.  It's okay tasting that way, but not good.<br /><br />With the wine conditioner, it tasts like a Gewurztraminer, but has a slightly bitter ending.  Also, this is not a 4-week kit.  It took a good 8-weeks total.  Once bottled, even 6-weeks later it's about the same as when it was bottled, so I'm not expecting any more improvement with time.<br /><br />Overall, it's okay, but I'd suggest buying a different kit.

If you like jasmine, you'll definitely love this tea!  I give this tea 5 stars for sight and smell and 4.5 stars for taste.  I wanted a little more spice or something in the taste, but I'm used to drinking black tea.  My favorite by Harney & Sons is their Hot Cinnamon Spice.

review/summary: Did not seem very fresh
review/text: The box arrived soaked on sesame oil. The individual bars were all covered in oil, though sealed. The bars were hard and gummy. I do not know if that is normal for this brand or if these were improperly stored. The sell by date had not been reached, so they were not expired. The halvah I had previously enjoyed was much lighter and flakier and that texture was what made them so good. These were shipped out of AZ, so maybe a hot warehouse or truck contributed to this? Not really certain, but somewhat disappointing. Since I do not know if this is normal for "Camel" brand halvah, I am giving them a 3 star rating. I should add that this box shipped from Nutricity.

This is coming from a former Red Bull junkie as well!<br /><br />Actually I also used to be addicted to coffee as well so this gives me both the energy boost I crave along with the flavor of a good coffee! It does have a good coffee flavor too! Its not too strong of a coffee flavor either although I used to adore strong coffee.<br /><br />This one is excellent for my morning "fix".

review/summary: Tastes just like an expensive coffee house drink!
review/text: This is my latest taste adventure from Red Leaf Tea! Now, I consider myself a bit of a coffee expert. I don't drink much coffee now but I used to live on the stuff and have had more than my fair share of traditional hot and iced mocha coffees. I wasn't super convinced that the mocha flavor would translate well to matcha, but I gave it a shot. I'm really glad that I did! This is pretty awesome. You can find more information and order some of this Mocha Matcha for yourself here: [...].<br /><br />I knew once I opened the pouch that I was in for a treat! This smells like a rich, dark chocolate with just a tiny bit of a coffee aroma coming through. Out of the matchas I've tried from Red Leaf Tea, this one had the most powerful aroma. Once again, I was impressed that the matcha was a beautiful, bright green despite being flavored. I immediately wanted to have this cold since that is how I prefer my coffee based mochas. So I added a really hefty scoop of this matcha into a blender bottle along with milk and a tiny drizzle of honey. After shaking it all up, it smells just like sitting in a coffee house!  The taste of this is completely awesome.  If I was blindfolded, I would be certain that this was a coffee based drink. The chocolate is dark and rich with the coffee flavors just backing everything up. The coffee flavoring isn't bitter or overpowering. I think I can taste just a hint of the matcha towards the end of the sip, but the flavoring is really in control of this  blend.<br /><br />Even though I almost always drink tea rather than coffee, it is nice to have something that will suit my occasional coffee cravings without having to brew an entire pot (and have the entire house smell) or go to an overpriced coffee shop. Like all of the matchas I've tried from Red Leaf Tea, this is really great and I think it would make a good addition to any baked good. I'm thinking that adding it to buttercream to top a chocolate cake would really set things off.  This is a great gateway matcha for those who enjoy coffee. There is no bitterness that matcha can sometimes have and the flavors are bold with a good kick of caffeine.

But all my doubts were blown away by the amazing flavor of this tea. When I opened the package, I knew I hadn't made a mistake. It smells like mocha. I made it into a cold almond milk latte and was just blown away by how well the flavor resembles a coffe-chocolate drink. I didn't feel like I was drinking matcha.

review/summary: Mochamochamochamocha!
review/text: Now, when I was in college, I worked in the campus library. Said campus library also contained a coffee shop where I got an employee discount, so I lived on sugary coffee drinks. I loved them, especially anything mixed with caramel. I learned how to brew coffee at home (yes, it took me until college to learn this), but it was never quite the same, so day after day I bought coffee after expensive coffee. It turns out, my body takes issue with both caffeine and dairy, so eventually I had to give up coffee. Have you ever seen a librarian strung out on coffee? Scary stuff. But considering I only liked it with extra sugar and way too much cream, it was probably for the best. Now, every once in a while my father in law will brew up a two cup pot when we're at his house and offer me a cup, but I just don't touch coffee anymore. Haven't since I started drinking looseleaf tea about two years ago. But occasionally, I miss it. Occasionally I just want a big cup of creamy coffee goodness and I have to tell myself no.<br /><br />So when I spotted this matcha, I had to have it. The caffeine in matcha doesn't affect me the way the caffeine in coffee does, and so I am very, very eager to try this. Maybe I'll even sprinkle in a bit of caramel....next time.<br /><br />When the package is opened, the smell of coffee hits you square in the nose. Mmm, I miss that smell. That smell only grows stronger as the matcha is brewed...mmm, it smells yummy. Okay, so, it's love at first sip. It tastes like strong, sweet coffee. It is lovely...there's even a hint of chocolate! I can't wait to try this in latte form with some Caramel Matcha...maybe even the English Toffee to bring out the chocolate in both. Definitely begging to be mixed with vanilla soy milk.  If you're a coffee fan, or an ex-coffee fan like myself, this is a matcha to try. It's so, so good. It's like an expensive coffee from Starbucks without the too high price tag and the horrible side effects of coffee! The aftertaste is almost one of roasted barley, which I like. Coffee always tasted burnt to me. But this is lovely. I see a happy future for me with this matcha at my side.

So I am always having to try different products and it starts adding up especially when she doesn't even finish the bag or won't even touch the treat.<br /><br />I read the reviews on this treat and saw such great reviews that I thought I would try it. As soon as I opened the bag she came running up to me. These treats are wonderful. She'll do almost anything to gets some! It's almost like she can't get enough of them. After years of looking for a great treat that she will continue eating my search is finally over!!!! This is a great product for a great price!!!!

review/text: Each June I travel with friends to Florida for a sign language convention. We always detour to 13 River Street, home of River Street Sweets in Savannah.  It's in my 'favorites' file on the GPS.  Their pralines are amazing, and their bear claws irresistable.  This year I had to resist.  I have acquired IBS, and can't eat chocolate, caffeine, dairy products and a host of other foods.  I can have sugar and egg whites, so I cruised their candy wall and picked out a pound of wrapped candies.  The only homemade candy I could eat was the divinity.  Its nuts on the top were a tolerably light sprinkling.  The divinity itself was an airy confection similar to homemade marshmallows.  Expensive marshmallows, but wickedly delicious!!

review/summary: Mojo flavor. Anywhere Amazon ships.
review/text: When I moved from Florida to Massachusetts this year, I realized I took Cuban food for granted; it's just not common in the Northeast. And oh, how I have missed it!<br /><br />If you've ever had pork, chicken or fish marinaded in mojo sauce, you're probably already sold on the flavor. This product - in 10 oz. bottles - allows you to marinade and cook a couple servings of your favorite protein with little or no waste of mojo sauce. I typically cook the chicken on the skillet with the sauce, then add the chicken to a bowl of yellow rice. It's simple, very flavorful, and hard to beat for the price and effort.<br /><br />Although I cannot rave enough about the flavor, I'm not a chef and can't talk about tasting notes. What I can offer is a list of *some* of the ingredients used in homemade mojo: Garlic, OJ, Lime, Cumin, Oregano, Cilantro, and Olive Oil.<br /><br />If you like the mojo, but just dont have access to it, I think the Amazon price is currently quite good. Get a few bottles.

review/text: I had been looking all around to buy Mojo sauce at my local grocery stores.  I couldn't find it and had a difficult time trying to replicate it at home because I also couldn't find sour orange juice.  This sauce is good and easy to grab to make a Cuban style roast in the crockpot with black beans and fried plantains.  I just add more garlic to the dish (personal preference).  Easy to keep in the pantry for when you need it.  I will buy this again once I run out.

review/text: I have never seen this type of reaction to a dry cat food.  One would think that there were baby chicks offered to some very hungry wild animals.  I have 16 cats and each one of them would attempt to harm anyone (cat or person) who came near their bowl of this cat food in an attempt to steal it.  Seriously, they growl at me if I try to move their bowl.<br /><br />Try it - you won't miss.  Being vegetarian, it was hard for me to mention the baby chicks but I was blown over by their reaction.  No other kind of cat food makes them act like that.  I actually did think that the first time I saw them with this food.

Marinate the wings in this sauce ( I used cider vinegar) for 4-6 hours, then cook on the BBQ. Reasonable price for a pint of sauce and very very good.

review/summary: Wins in blind taste test
review/text: I made this wine and it had been in the bottle about 2 1/2 months. I bought a 16$ bottle of Verdicchio at a local store and took it to a party. We did a blind taste test with a group very familiar with Italian wines and my wine won hands down. In fact the owner of Bar Italia in St. Louis was very impressed.<br /><br />A couple of notes on the wine making. I did add water to 6 gals but when I racked the wine after primary fermentation I racked into a 5 gal carboy and did not add water. I have another kit of this variety and this time I will add some yeast nutrient and ferment at a lower temp. Last time my primary fermentation was finished in 4 days.

There is a really horrible fake maple and brown sugar odor that engrosses the whole packaging even before you take the first bite!  Once your skin even touches the envelope, you cannot even wash the fake maple and brown sugar smell off with hot soapy water.  We looked forward to trying this, as we use the the regular variety often.  When you go to the grocery, just pick up the box, give it a slight squeeze and sniff.  The compare it to the regular.  It seems like they are even using a fake aroma on the outer packaging to drive you to an impulse buy.  Really bad stuff!

review/text: I usually like most of the Quakier Instant Oatmeal varieties, but I had to throw this one away.  I managed to eat one bowlful and it did keep me satisfied for quite a while, but there is a weird aftertaste or background taste that was not at all appealing to me.  When I tried it again a few days later, I threw it away after 2 spoonfuls and I won't be having it again.  The nutritional boosts and not getting hungry again too soon are appealing, but when you are trying to lose wieght, you want to at least enjoy the food that you are eating.  So, I'd rather have some regular instant oatmeal and enjoy breakfast.

review/summary: pretty bad coffee
review/text: I ordered this along with a bunch of other whole-bean coffees to try over a weekend, and this was the worst by far.  The beans were dry, powdery, and likely old.  I think they were probably sitting on the shelf for a good period of time before being shipped to me.  The coffee was weak and bordering on flavorless.  I even ran it through my french press and the grounds refused to clump together, they were separated the entire time and the flavor was awful.  I tried to create my own blend along with a darker roast, but to no avail.  Sadly, I ended up throwing half the bag away.  I ordered another colombian roast at the same time and it fared far better.  Lesson learned.

review/text: All around best supplier of medium-to-high grade blend coffees at reasonable prices. To get a better cup of joe you'll have to pay a much higher price. I've bought a number of Magnum Exotics' whole bean coffees over the past couple years and the blends are consistent across purchases and they have all been flavorful in slightly different ways. The Columbian is our second favorite after their Kona blend, which is a bit fruitier. All of these blends respond well to several different grinds and are very forgiving in the hands of the uninitiated.

The Jamaican blend is sweeter but a little weaker.  This is quite a bit better than 8 o clock bean , which for some reason Consumer reports rates really highly.  I think the Starbucks Columbia is better than all of them but it's pricey.  I'm having a hard time going to anything else after having the robust kick and aroma of the Starbucks House blend and Columbia, they are just so good -  Starbucks has ruined me it seems.

review/summary: Happy doggy tail
review/text: These 10-11 inch retriever rolls are about the best price I've found. At the time of my order, they came out to about $1 a piece, which is the same price as my local dollar store. However, there are several reasons why I'll keep buying them here. First, these are rolled very tightly and seem to contain more rawhide per roll. Being as dense as they are, it keeps a big chewer busy longer. Second, it's hard to stock up at our dollar store, because they never have too many on hand. I don't like having to stop in every week to see if they happen to have some in stock. Buying them at Amazon means I'm stocked up at the click of a mouse. The only reason I didn't give a 5-star rating was that they are marked Product of Brazil, rather than being made in the USA. I'll still keep buying them, though.

review/summary: Not for busy chewers
review/text: I bought these 'retriever rolls' for my 18 month old yellow lab.  He went through most of one in an evening.  They are not very compressed and unroll easily.  He got his teeth attached to the end that was unrolling, put his paws on the roll, pulled hard and basically unrolled it like fruit leather.  The rolls don't hold up as long as others and I won't be reordering them.

review/summary: Great Product, Great Bargain
review/text: These have gone in price (by 50% of the original price) since I originally wrote this review but its still a bargain compared to what you pay at other retailers.<br /><br />November 2006<br />When I first ordered the retriever rolls I was worried I had sacrificed quality for quantity but I was absolutely wrong.  Each retriever was about 11" long and about 1.25" thick.  They were identical in quality to the rawhide rolls I buy at the pet store for $2.99 each!!  I have a VERY active 18 month (100 lbs) yellow lab but when I give him a retriever roll he will lay down to chew and play for hours at a time.  They are thick and durable enough to last about week which is a miracle since he is a chewing machine.  I highly recommend them to anyone with a puppy or dog who chews.

review/summary: Different Quality
review/text: These were of a different quality than the first bag of 20 chews I purchased online.  They were the same brand, but the package was different and they were much lower in quality.  My dog had diarrhea for two days after downing one of these.  They were darker and different colors, compared to the first batch which were white and consistent. I'm almost afraid to order online again.

review/summary: pretty good
review/text: Good but not as substantial as the ones I have bought at CostCo in the past.  I thought they were more solid in the middle.  Thse splinter too easily.

review/summary: My dogs love these the best!!
review/text: My dogs are Goldens so of course they love to chew and eat rawhide. This roll is wonderful because  it doesnt leave a mess like many of the other types did. It is highly digestible so I dont worry about how much they are getting.  This seller is always top notch in my book.

review/summary: Retriever Rolls
review/text: My dog loves most retriever rolls I have given her and these are no exception.  She likes them just fine, but I find that they splinter into many small pieces as she is chewing on them and this makes an ugly mess.  Other than the mess, these retriever rolls are fine; however, next time I will try another kind of roll. Also, these rolls cost about $1 a roll whereas the last time I ordered rolls (through EBay) they cost half as much (100 for about $50).  Maybe the price has doubled over the past year because I wasn't able to find retriever rolls any cheaper than the ones I am reviewing here today.

review/summary: Ouch!
review/text: While these rawhides are large and take a fair amount of time for my lab to finish one, I don't deem it safe. As my dog chews the rawhide, sharp slivers break off and are left behind. I'll walk through the house barefoot and find these sharp remnants wherever the dog was chewing them and they HURT! I can only imagine what it's like for the dog to be chewing and get one of these shards jammed into his gums or worse, swallow one and get it stuck in his throat. I am not a fan of this product.

review/summary: Dog doesn't like them
review/text: My German Shepherd loves chewing, but for some reason, these just do not interest her at all. She'll occasionally carry one around in her mouth from one room to another, but she won't chew them. Maybe other dogs like these, but they were a waste of money for us.
