review/summary: Good product, stale inventory, great customer service
review/text: The box shipped to me receives one star for old and stale inventory.<br />The product itself receives 5 stars.<br />Amazon receives 5 stars for refunding the full purchase amount.<br />Customer Service receives 5 starts for their professional conduct.<br /><br />For several years I have been purchasing my favorite LaraBar flavors at the nearest Trader Joe's location. I recently moved to an area where TJ has little presence, if any, and ordered the bars from Amazon instead. Although the label on the box had indicated the expiration date was 10 months away, the first bar I chewed into was dry, stale, with a bitter after taste. This is disappointing because I am familiar with this product and I know what flavor to expect. I still like LaraBar and will continue to consume it but my next purchase will have to be from a brick and mortar location where I can sample an individual bar prior to purchasing a full box.<br />Upon my request Amazon had issued a full refund for this purchase. Hail Amazon!!!!

review/text: I can't believe some people actually manage to compare these bars to Snickers or other fake-ingredient bars. Really? A 200 calories of fruit and nuts vs. hydrogenated, high-fructose, heart-attack calling candy bars should really make this decision easy.<br />I actually came across Larabars just recently. I heard about them, but I was just never too curious to actually read the ingredients and try one. To give a little background on my life-style, I do all of my own cooking to make sure I know exactly what goes into it. I stray away from all the processed foods and I don't eat grains and starches such as potatoes. I also don't eat refined sugars as it falls into a category of processed foods. With that said, I am a human being and I do get cravings for something dessert-like. I have very high standards for my dessert. It has to be all-natural, unprocessed, and preferably without added sweeteners. With all of those requirements one has to pretty much always prepare their desserts from scratch because there aren't whole lot of prepackaged foods out there that have that same philosophy about preparing it. Larabar is one of the very few out there who actually got it right.<br />I was a little skeptical about the taste of the bars when I bought a couple to sample, but they all exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be buying them in the future.<br />Now, I wouldn't overindulge in eating a few of those a day as they are still plenty sweet and carbolicious, but I usually have a few bites after lunch as a dessert treat. One bar lasts me 3-4 days and I will choose it over Snickers any time of the day.

review/summary: Wonderful fruit and nuts on the go
review/text: This bar is great for getting raw fruit and nuts into your family. Could the nuts be chopped a bit smaller? Sure. But then the whole bar would be too mushy. Could they use fewer dates (to cut the sugar) and make the bar as moist? Doubtful. Cheries are tough as dried fruit goes, and I'm guessing that's the reason for the excessive dates. (Note, though, I can't stand plain dates and I don't notice the flavor or find them overwhelming. I'd just like a more tart, less sweet bar.)<br />This is the alternative to giving yourself and your family dried fruit--this bar is softer, easier to share, and slightly more flavorful than the best dried fruit. It makes nuts palatable to kids who think they don't like nuts. And that means more protein into your diet (though not as much as I'd like, it has exponentially more than plain fruit).<br />Great bar. Good price through Amazon. Stash these bars in your car, your briefcase, your desk drawer, your diaper bag, your kids' backpacks, and your family's workout bags.

review/text: I started picking up these bars at the health food store after I had to give up granola bars.  The cherry pie bars taste amazingly like the real filling, except without all the unnecessary sugar.  The bars are sweet enough on their own and the nuts add a delightful crunch.  The other flavors are delicious as well.  The price of the individual bars can fluctuate by more than sixty cents depending on the vendor and Amazon sells them for less as a large package than the individuals would cost at the cheapest store.  The organic ingredients and lack of additives ensure that the bars are gluten-free, but are still tasty.

review/text: The creators of this flavor (in the excellent larabar line of energy bars) got the lemon flavor perfect;but why did they leave out the potassium common in most other selections?The potassium is what makes the good "well being" feeling after you have digested this wonderful fiber heavy food and without that you get a curious hollow feeling when you are supposed to be humming.That is Humm Foods goal, after all.I wonder what lara was thinking about with this one flavor?I would suggest a re-working of the lemon selection to incorporate more minerals.( especially the potassium).Otherwise, these are great bars; the cherry pie and cinnemon roll are the best ,followed by banana cookie,pecan pie,and apple pie of the flavors I have tried.But as everyone knows, most no other opinion is more subjective than taste.

This has been a great filling substitute. These ones taste just like a PB cookie without all the preservatives and other junk in it!

review/summary: Moldy!!!
review/text: I love Larabars, and have about 1 a day during the week - so much so, that I have been ordering them in bulk to save a few bucks.  I very much like the spiciness of the Ginger Snap flavor, and is probably my 4th favorite flavor (after the brownie, bluberry muffin and pecan pie).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the latest bars I received were moldy, and they don't expire for months.  This item is not eligible for return, which is unfortunate.  $25 into the compost....what a waste!

review/summary: This is what a really healthy snack bar is ....
review/text: I think that this series of Larabar is what a real healthy snack should contain. If you look at the ingredients on all of this series of Larabars, then you'll see that it has only 3-4 ingredients like the fruit itself, dates and some form of nuts. It doesn't have sugar, salt or other preservatives. Because of the dates, it has natural sweetness and because of the nuts, it has natural saltiness. The nuts also give this bar it's calories (an average bar is about 200 calories).  The taste is well ... not like eating a Nature Valley snack bar. The taste is more like eating mashed fruit and nuts mixed together with dates. If you don't like dates or have a thing against dates, I wouldn't buy any of this series of Larabars because 90% of them have dates as a main ingredients. I think they use it as a natural binder. Because of this, I find that a majority of their bars taste kind of the same ... heavily flavored with dates.<br /><br />But, if you're trying to snack healthily and want to avoid processed foods and those sugary / salty snacks in the "snack bar" aisle at the supermarket, this is the bar to go with. Plus, if you buy it in bulk from Amazon, it comes out to be less than $1.25 / bar whereas at the markets it can go as high as $2.00+ / bar.  You just need to go the market and try all the flavors first before you commit to 16 bars of the same flavor at Amazon. It would suck to order 16 bars of a flavor and find out that you can stand the taste of it after the fact.

review/text: First of all, if you haven't tried Larabars yet, you're missing out!  All of their flavors taste just like their names.  Before I tried the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, my favorite flavor Larabar was Key Lime Pie (it tastes just like real key lime pie but is so much better for you!)  What first impressed me about Larabar is that I can pronounce all of their ingredients.  What next impressed me was that my picky 3 year old would eat them! He's now 5 and these are still his favorite snack.  Perfect way to get him some healthy, natural calories when he won't eat anything else.  These are my favorite breakfast, and they're best refrigerated.  They're a staple in our house.  Highly recommend!

review/text: These satiate my need for either a quick breakfast or something to eat in the afternoon for a snack when I need something I can carry in my purse. I've tried the lemon and the apple pie. I've very please with them both, but I didn't have unrealistic expectations for them. We, socially, have his idea that for example if we're unwrapping the lemon bar it's going to be bright yellow, vibrant, and very lemony. Not the case. They come out brown and nutty with a light, fragrant lemon flavor. The apple pie is the same. Unwrapped it is a brownie sized cut of brown apple pulp with ample nuts mixed in; very simple, tasty, and meets my need for a quick boost of fruit that won't immediate spoil like buying the freshest of produce might.

review/summary: Healthy RAW Snack
review/text: Some people say these are a high fat , high calorie , high glycemic , glorified candybar. I say otherwise. Concerning fat, not all fats are equal , some being healthy . Since this bar is raw all of the fat,protein and sugar have not been denatured  which means you get the full health benefit. As far as being high calorie , considering how nutrient dense these babies are I don't consider 200 calories high in calories at all. For me 200 calories is a perfect number allowing it to be used an nutrient dense snack or a quick meal on the go.<br /><br />Concerning these supposedly being high glycemic , sure , if you were to eat the dates in these by themselves it would be , but the nuts in them bring the glycemic load of the entire bar way down , which is another benefit of the healthy fats in these bars , it allows for the sugars to be released slower and for it to digest slower making you feel full and satisfied longer.<br /><br />As far as these not being any better than a candybar I say noway! No preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup , etc, in these babies , just a healthy combo of fruit and nuts. How many nutrients does a candybar have ? Now look at the nutrient in these , loaded with minerals . Also, unlike many other foods these aren't naturally low in nutrients and then "fortified" with man made vitamins and minerals to make them then appear healthy. All the nutrients in these are naturally occuring which gives you the benefits in a synergistic way where other healthy compounds such as flavonoids and phenols work together with naturally occurring vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />People need to let go of the old dogma which makes them think all fat is bad but if it's sugar free then it MUST be good. If that were true then cotton candy , pepsi and skittles would all be great for ya !Fruit and nuts makes for a good healthy breakfast or snack. I'll eat my greens/green smoothies in the other meals of the day. A person shouldn't eat only fruit and nuts during the day but they shouldn't only eat greens either . These bars help make it easy to strike a balance in your diet on the go. Larabars, Pure bars , SmartMonkey bars and ThinkOrganic bars are all healthy brands of raw bars that amazon sells and all worth a try . Experiment and see what flavors you like best , or make your own !

review/summary: Some GREAT Some HORRIBLE overall i'm HOOKED!!!
review/text: Tropical Fruit Tart<br />5 Stars<br />This bar is very refreshing with a wonderful fruit and citrus flavor and soft chewy texture.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough<br />2 Stars<br />I'm not a fan of this flavor. The bar would be much better without the chocolate chips that somehow leave a funny aftertaste.<br /><br />Coconut Cream Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Oh my I do love coconut, and this bar was better then I expected it to be. Wonderful texture and not too chewy. This would be a great replacement for the raspberry coconut zingers I'm addicted to!<br /><br />Cinnamon Roll<br />3 Stars<br />This one didn't blow me away or disappoint so I am giving it an average review. The bar was a little harder then I would have preferred and the Cinnamon flavor could have been stronger. It should just be called Cinnamon as it does not have any flavors that could hint as being a healthy bar flavored like a cinnamon roll. If you like cinnamon you will probably like this bar but if you are indifferent to cinnamon I would skip this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie<br />3 Stars<br />This one's ok... Good texture, not nearly the amount of cashew flavor I expected for something called "Cashew Cookie", and it almost had a stale flavor even though it was eaten well before the best by date.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip<br />5 Stars<br />This bar definitely hit my sweet tooth. Great texture, no funny aftertaste like some of the other chocolate Larabar flavors and I would definitely put this on the list of candy bar replacements!<br /><br />Pecan Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Not overwhelmingly sweet, great pecan pie flavor, perfect soft, slightly chewy texture.<br /><br />Lemon Bar<br />5 Stars<br />Very nice Lemon flavor and a wonderful chewy texture that reminds you of an actual Lemon Bar! The Lemon lingers in your mouth quite a while.<br /><br />Banana Bread<br />1 Star<br />This bar was bitter. There's only 3 ingredients: Almonds, Dates, and Unsweetened bananas. Well bananas are naturally sweet so what was so bitter in this bar? Some people might not find this as bad as I did, but I couldn't get past the first bite.<br /><br />Apple Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Another favorite flavor. It tastes like apple pie with a few nuts. It's just perfect.<br /><br />Ginger Snap<br />5 Stars<br />Wonderful Ginger snap cookie taste! This is probably the sweetest one I've tried. Good texture, chewy and crunchy, and delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter & Jelly<br />3 Stars<br />This bar had a great texture but only a so-so flavor. I would not purchase a full box of these bars, but I would pick it over some of the others if I had a limited choice.<br /><br />Key Lime Pie<br />5 Stars<br />This was a nutty bar, which is to be expected, but the subtle hint of lime was delightful. I could stand to use even more lime flavor but the soft chewy texture and lime flavor make this one of my favorites.<br /><br />UPDATE w/Additional Flavors:<br /><br />Blueberry Muffin<br />5 Stars<br />Oh, I think I've found a new favorite! This bar has a wonderfully rich blueberry flavor without being too sweet and it reminds me of a Blueberry Oatmeal Muffin.<br /><br />Chocalate Coconut Chew<br />3 Stars<br />As a huge fan of the Coconut Cream I had high hopes for this bar but after eating it the only thing I could say was "Where's the coconut?!" I definitley missed the coconut texture and flavor. The chocolate flavor of this bar however was not too sweet, not overpowering, and overall the bar will suffice for a chocolate lovers craving.

Depending on which Larabar you choose, the Amazon per unit price ranges from 1.35 for the Cherry to 1.83 for the chocolate per unit.  Amazon needs to adjust its price in order to be competitive in the market.

review/summary: Banana bread brownie?
review/text: Wow, I just had my first Larabar today after a long run, and I have been blown away.  As of late my preference has been for protein bars, but I had picked up a Larabar a few months ago just because it looked interesting.<br /><br />I tried the "banana cookie dough" flavor, since I'm a banana nut.  Unwrapping the package was difficult, though I've since found out that they have a multi-layer wrapper because there are no preservatives.  Once open, I was confronted with a raw looking rectangle of brown with pale chunks in it.  It looked moist and smelled phenomenal.  The first bite made me think "banana bread", and as I ate the rest of the bar I decided it wasn't quite like banana bread, but closer to that than a "cookie", in any case.  The pale chunks were the #1 ingredient - almonds.  The #2 and #3 ingredients were dates and bananas, respectively.  The #4 ingredient was.... nothing.  There are only 3 ingredients.  I actually flipped the wrapper over to see the continuation of the ingredients list before I realized that there was no more list!<br /><br />These bars are a little expensive for a non-protein energy bar, but the taste is like nothing you would expect from a brown rectangular smashed together food thing.  Its simply incredible, and now I have to go back and purchase the other flavors to try them out, too.

I love these bars as they are really filling and taste great (unless you are a sugar addict and need everything to have that super sweet calorie filling flavor!)  I also appreciate that I can buy cases of just one flavor at Amazon.com because the store where I've been buying them has 3 flavors per box and I prefer chocolate the most.  Whoever wrote the poor review about the high fat doesn't understand much about diet!  I've lost 20 pounds using these bars as a morning snack between meals combined with regular exercise and watching portion sizes.  Fat isn't the monster some think it is.. you need it and these bars provide a natural fat full of Omega 3 and Omega 6 along with a good mix of carbs and protein.  Thank you Lara Bar.

review/summary: short on ingredients, long on utter deliciousness
review/text: These are my favorite variety of Larabar.  If you like gingerbread (not gingersnaps or gingerbread cookies, mind you -- actual gingerbread, the kind that you can eat by the slice) than I am willing to bet that you will love these bars as much as I do.  The taste is exactly like that of freshly baked gingerbread; the texture is moist like gingerbread but crunchy because of the nuts the bar contains.  The crunchiness, in my opinion, doesn't detract a whit from the overall fabulousness of these bars -- in fact, I would say it adds to it.<br /><br />Finally (and this is true of all Larabars) the stunning brevity of the ingredient list bears noting.  Larabars contain no added sugar, no artificial flavoring or coloring, and no preservatives.  All of the sweetness and flavor (and there is just enough of the former and plenty of the latter) come from wholly natural, healthful sources.

review/text: I can't have gluten or oates so this is a great snack to carry around if you're stuck on some kind of nutritional pariah boat.<br />It filling and a bit sweet (hello there, dates), but doesn't go overboard. If it went overboard you'd be leaving your nutritional pariah boat. That would be be unsafe.

review/summary: Super tasty, pronounceable ingredients
review/text: I was on the lookout for granola bars that have ingredients that are more natural. I used to love Nature Valley bars, then I fell in love with the FiberOne bars, then I inhaled Balance bars. Now I think I've settled on Larabars, simply because they have such few ingredients and I can pronounce every single one of them. Even better, I can go to a regular grocery store and buy the ingredients, and if I'd want to spend more time in the kitchen, I could make them myself! (google for recipes, people really do make them themselves!)<br /><br />Love that Amazon sells them in bulk (they can get quite pricey, depending on which grocery store you go to).<br /><br />My favorite flavers are the Coconut Creme Pie, the Keylime Pie, the Carrot Cake, and the Cherry Pie. Soooo good! I don't leave the house without one or two of these in my bag :)

review/summary: Bars were moldy!
review/text: (NOTE: I purchased this box on July 8, 2012 -- not May 2012. Amazon must have used the date of a prior Larabar purchase.)<br /><br />I think Larabars are healthy; I've been eating them almost daily for years, but I like only a few flavors, and ginger snap is the best! But beware when they have a strange, sharp flavor (it tastes almost chemical to me)! This was the third box I have purchased that had this problem (out of about 8 boxes total). It always affects every bar in the box. I was able to get a refund for the first two boxes, but not this box from Amazon (I don't know why not), so I am going through the manufacturer (now General Mills), but it is not easy (I have to mail back all the wrappers I have).<br /><br />After finding mold on one of the bars, I had two of the bars tested by a food research company. I was told that the problem is the water content, the Aw, which was .717 on the moldy bar (from one lot) and .687 on the other bar (from a different lot), which tasted bad but had no visible mold (other bars in that box were later found to have mold as well). These bars still had more than 7 months before their expiration date.<br /><br />Here's a quote from the food researcher: "Pathogens cannot survive below water activity (Aw) 0.86 so food borne illness is not a risk below this Aw. Between Aw 0.60 and 0.70 the microorganisms of concern are xerophilic molds and osmophilic yeasts...In summary, the Lara Bar labeled "Bad" had an Aw high enough to support growth of mold and yeast. The other Lara Bar sample also had fairly high Aw, high enough to support growth of mold & yeast. As a standard practice, we target an Aw of less than or equal to 0.60 for all shelf stable products (with pH >4.2) in order to avoid growth of all pathogens and spoilage organisms. All manufacturers should be targeting an Aw of &#8804;0.65 unless they are adding preservatives."<br /><br />I don't know if I will give up on these bars yet, because when they do it right, they are really good!

review/text: These bars are great to have around for when you're running late and need something filling for breakfast.  They are also great to have in your purse or at work when you're surrounded by non-paleo options.  Our family likes these because they are sweet without being overpowering and filling.  The Cashew Cookie, Blueberry and Lemon bars are our favorite!  We can order them by the case through Amazon, and have them shipped to our door way cheaper than we can buy them in our grocery store. These alone pretty much pay for our Amazon Prime membership!

review/summary: So glad I finally tried these
review/text: I have been wanting to try Larabars for over a year. Finally today I picked up a box at Sam's club (the only place even remotely close to me that carries them), and I couldn't be more pleased. The bar I tried today was Apple Pie. The ingredients in the Apple Pie bar are dates, almonds, apples, walnuts, raisins and cinnamon. That's it. All natural, real food. I will say that it does not look enticing, or actually even at all appealing, and the texture leaves something to be desired...but it tastes wonderfully natural and gives a nice energy boost. It will be perfect for before/after/during workouts, but has enough calories that if I am too busy to eat a meal it will suffice. Does it taste like apple pie? Only slightly. But people who aren't accustomed to eating apple pie really won't mind, or may not even notice.

It looked like a candybar-shaped turd.<br /><br />But then I ate it, and the texture wasn't that great either so I was still grossed out with the image of the turd, but kept eating it. To my great relief it tasted really nice. There is a lot of flavor for how few of ingredients there are.<br /><br />Also, I really liked the minimalistic ingredient list. My advice, just don't look at it when you eat it.

review/text: I have tried several flavors of Larabar and I like them all well enough, but the Ginger Snap is my absolute favorite. It is delicious and satisfying. Larabars are sweet, but a lot of bars taste too sweet to me. Larabars are less sweet than some so someone who wants a really sweet snack might prefer something different, but I believe anyone who likes the taste of ginger would enjoy this bar. It tastes like ginger spice cake. I love it.

I love that they are raw, vegan, Kosher, contain all-natural ingredients and have no processed sugar.  These taste better, are healthier, and have a better texture than most lines of exercise-oriented energy bars.

review/summary: Nice snack bar alternative!
review/text: Well, if you are following the "only eat processed foods with five ingredients or less" rule, this product, Larabar's "cherry pie" fits the bill.  There are three ingredients: dates, almonds, and cherries.<br /><br />As a sports snack, it has 200 calories (70 from fat), 5g protein, and 5g fiber.  It's not a high protein bar for muscle building, but it does have the calories for glycogen replacement.<br /><br />It's not really crumbly or melty, so it transports well.  And if you are looking for a gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, vegan snack, this may be for you.  Most of us will snarf it down in about 4 bites.  If you need something that takes longer to eat, look elsewhere.

review/text: Trying to find an alternative for breakfast, I stubled upon these Larabars. After deciding on the Apple Pie flavor, I found one of the best tasting alternatives to breakfast I have ever eaten. Each bite is massive amounts of apple taste. The bars are well spread with nuts but the fruit taste is where it is at. The only downside is that the bars are kinda small so you will have to eat multiples.

I grabbed one fresh out of the box so they were hot and I later found then to be better hot and soft than at room temp. I would suggest giving that a shot. (I leave them in the car after a break at work and let them heat up that way, I have never microwaved them - I would imagine that would ruin them)

review/summary: Healthy Yummy Goodness
review/text: Wow - these are unexpectedly delicious!  Yes pricey, but you're getting a lot of healthy nuts and fruit in this bar.  And as far as I know, safe to eat when you are following the Paleo diet.  A great occasional treat -- yum!  The texture is nice and soft, just a little chewy and not too crumbly.
