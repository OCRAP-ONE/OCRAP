review/summary: Simple, elegant, delicious
review/text: These are by far the best dark chocolate nonpareils I have ever had. I first discovered these marvelous discs of succulent deliciousness at my local grocery store. I have a soft spot for dark chocolate, so I wasn't even slightly off put by the higher-than-average price tag for small 3 oz bag of these. Now I have the convenience of purchasing a whole pound for a cheaper price per unit? Oh dear god help me. I can resist anything but temptation.<br /><br />I'm not the best at describing flavor, but I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise anyway. If you like dark chocolate or nonpareils, you will love these. Try them at least once!

review/text: I love these truffles! I usually buy the bags at the grocery store but it's a total crapshoot as to how they've been stored so they sometimes haven't been kept cool enough and it ruins the outside shell so i thought I'd try buying them from Amazon. They came in two days with regular shipping (nice!) and were packed really well with chill bags. They were perfect! I will definitely order them again.

review/summary: Not As Expected
review/text: We had some other maker's dark chocolate truffles and loved them, but couldn't find them. We had seen commercials for these Lindt truffles, so I gave these a try.  They are listed as dark chocolate, but I would only consider them as milk chocolate.  We MUCH prefer dark over milk chocolate, and would not order milk chocolate truffles.  So we were disappointed.  They are probably real good if you like milk chocolate, but if you are expecting dark chocolate, you might want to try a small sample first, or get some from another maker.<br /><br />So now we have to eat all these.  It will be a tough job, but we will get through it.  I just wish their dark chocolate was dark.

review/summary: Best chocolates available!
review/text: My husband loves his chocolate fix, but there is really nothing more satisfying to him than the Lindor Dark Chocolate Truffles -- for him, every other chocolate candy pales by comparison. So to go completely overboard for Valentine's Day, I ordered the 60-count box. Yes, that may have been overdoing it, but I couldn't have made him happier. Also, he had recently seen a History Channel special on the making of chocolate, and was pleased to see the high quality of Lindor's processing featured! He has exercised unbelievable restraint in making the box last a while -- and every single bite brings bliss. Bravo, Lindor! Letting these dark chocolate truffles melt slowly in your mouth is a truly sensuous experience.

review/summary: best chocolate for  a reasonable price
review/text: I have purchased this at least twice, maybe 3 times...once I got the 120 count box and that lasted a long time. I am not a fan of dark chocolate, but this is not a truly DARK chocolate flavor. It is not quite milk, but not bitter like dark chocolate can be. The Truffles with the black wrapping are way too dark chocolate for me...so this is a nice balance between the milk chocolate in the red wrapper and the black wrapper dark Lindor truffles. I have to keep a sharp eye on the price, because for a while there it went WAY up and I didn't buy during that time. The reviewers that complained about melting must have not received their candy carefully wrapped in a styrofoam box, with little ice packs in the box. By the time mine got here on a very hot day, the packs were melted, but the chocolate was fine. Love the convenience and quantity!

review/text: This thing makes a great present for any chocolate lover, I ordered all three, milk, dark, and white... and have had no complaints from serious connoisseurs. The price is only contestable when Lindt holds its 2 for 19oz bags @ 20 deal, but still, you are cutting it really close, and when you factor in shipping, forget it. Walmart at best can only match this price through an online offer, however, with additional charges this substantially brings up the total cost.<br /><br />Word of caution, this deal may not work for those requiring shipping in hot weather or steamy climates.<br />Comment

review/summary: The Best Dark Chocklate!
review/text: I have tried to love DARK chocolate since reading so much about it's health benefits...... especially compared to milk chocalate.  Trouble is, it is usually too bitter for my sugar corrupted taste buds.<br /><br />This particular divine mouthful of heaven is a decided exception!  I really think that this traditional,revered company richly deserves it's enduring reputation!<br /><br />The "per unit" price is also exceptional, especially for European chocalate.<br /><br />The retail display packaging is easily disposed of,  and my only fear initially,as I tipped these glorious morsels into a silver bowl, was that I would be induced to eat one EVERY time I passed this enticing little mountain of deliciousness!<br /><br />Surprise!  This exceptional treat is truly so satisfying that I seriously don't crave another, and another! As a woman who can easily consume an entire bag of Maui potato chips in one sitting, this is remarkable!!!

review/text: My two kittens can be quite picky with treats, but these things bring out their inner wild ocelot. One bats it around all over the house like half-dead prey for twenty minutes, while the littler one sits in the corner gnawing on it and snarling to break it down and keep it away from other predators. Who knew indoor cats could get this way over a simple treat. These duck hearts are on the big side (for cats or small dogs), but my two kittens seem to like the challenge of taking the time to chomp them down. They're pretty easy to cut into smaller pieces with a butter knife, if you do want to give them bite sized pieces. All in all, I highly recommend!

review/summary: Good for pilling, too!
review/text: I tried these treats for my cat who was having serious nausea and food issues. Because organ meats contain taurine, I wanted a limited ingredient treat to augment meat-only baby food (which obviously lacks taurine). Despite being very nauseous, my cat gobbled these up.<br /><br />If they like these things, it's like kitty crack. Out of my three cats, two LOVE these. The other one wouldn't even try them (he's that way).<br /><br />I gave a bag of five cut-up heart pieces to a friend to try with his IBD kitty. He put the bag on the counter and in the morning found the chewed up bag with all of the treats gone!<br /><br />I use kitchen shears to cut each heart into about four pieces. I was very pleased to discover that the end pieces can easily hold a pill, making them a grain-free pill pocket. It's been a great help in pilling my sick cat. (Fortunately, he's now doing well and can eat cat food -- and these special treats, of course!)

review/text: I bought these along with some bonito flakes as a replacement to unhealthy processed cat treats (with disgusting ingredients and byproducts) that were making them fat. I make my own real meat cat food with chicken, turkey, beef, liver, heart, gizzards, bone and vitamins, so the treats were the only thing they were still eating from a shelf.  Because it can be hard to find chicken hearts, I have to add extra taurine to the cat food.  I like that I can now give them real heart as a treat or training aid.  I chose duck hearts to mix it up a bit.  It's a good price and there are a ton in the pack and it's a resealable Ziploc bag.  The hearts can be broken into pieces as well.  The cats love it.

review/text: I gave my 3 year old yorkie this treat and he snubbed it. I tried mixing it in a bowl of his food and he picked around it. The bag was vacuum sealed and appeared fresh, so not sure if he just wasn't in the mood or he didn't like them. Giving a 4-star for packaging and product freshness.

review/summary: Dissapointed
review/text: I ordered these after my husband and I started remembering candy bars from our childhood.. I remembered the 7-up bars, which I loved, and he remembered these bars.. I did a search on the internet and discovered the 7-up bars are no longer made, but these are. So I bought a box of them for us since I'd never seen them in stores (right after that, we noticed them in a few stores. lol).. I love chocolate, but this is that cheaper kind of chocolate.. I'm not sure what the difference is, but it's unnaturally too sweet and kind of cheap tasting. The fillings are also way too sweet, in a cheap product kind of way.. The peanut butter is barely there, the white creamy feeling is just too sweet and cheap tasting (like the cheaper candy they sell in stores), the caramel is ok, but there isn't a whole lot in there and the fudge center is also ok, but there also isn't a lot in there.. All in all, this isn't the candy of yesteryear...<br /><br />We only ate a few each and have started giving them to the kids and grandkids stuck in gifts, just trying to get rid of them. Some of the grandkids don't even like them, though.<br /><br />Unless yo like that cheap, overprocessed, over sweetened chocolate and filling taste, I wouldn't recommend these.

review/text: I am cooking for someone who is in CHF, so sodium free is a must.  I first tried this product in Heinz No-Salt ketchup and was impressed that there wasn't a metallic after-taste.  I tracked this down and have used it in baking mixes, general cooking or anything that I would normally salt.  It's really good!  I had to slip it by my Dad, but once he actually tried it in food, he was hooked.  It's not identical to salt flavor, but it's close enough to fool many!  I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Pretty good stuff!
review/text: I ordered this from Vitacost and received it promptly.  This is about as good as it gets for a salt substitute.  Don't taste it out of the jar, put it on something and it does taste like salt.  It doesn't have that potassium aftertaste that most salt substitutes have, even though it contains potassium chloride.  There is 356mg of potassium per 1/4 tsp. so people who need to limit their potassium should be aware of that.  I use it mainly in recipes for the bread machine so the bread doesn't fall, about 1/2 tsp. per loaf and the bread comes out perfect.  You might have to adjust the amount of yeast to just a teaspoon or a little more.<br /><br />As stated by the previous reviewer, I used to order it direct from AlsoSalt but the last time waited for months for a shipment.  Ordering from Vitacost through Amazon is the way to go.

I thought this was a brilliant plan to save a little money, and to cut out the wasted rice.<br /><br />No.  This is no substitute. For starters, jarred caviar is reeeeally salty and preservative-y tasting.  Which I maybe could have dealt with for the price difference, except that whatever the "Smokehouse" flavor is is GROSS.  I even like a smoky beer a local brewery makes, but this was not for me.<br /><br />I will not be buying again.

For starters, the color wasn't anything like the picture. It wasn't bright orange. It was more brown in color. It was only half full and it definitely wasn't "fluffy" looking. Against my better judgement, I spooned more than a few into my mouth only to discover that it had a horrible bitter taste to it. Because it is a grocery item, Amazon's policies prohibit its return (for safety reasons). However, Amazon did continue to earn my business by quickly refunding the $20 I paid for it. The refund processed within a day. I won't ever buy this product again.

review/summary: Nice Pickle, Very Good Deal
review/text: I usually buy Indian mixed pickles in a large can but gave the MTR brand a shot and was pleasantly surprised. Very strong, spicy flavor and aftertaste, you can tell there's Asafoetida (sort of a gum resin, used as a digestive aid, popular in Indian pickles and often substituted for onions and garlic in cooking by some as a religious preference). Has a bit of sauce with the vegetables which for me is great. A little can go along way and it's a great condiment for rice and some Indian meals. I've eaten this out of the jar by the spoonful, it's one of those tastes one can aquire and find hard to shake.<br /><br />This is advertised as a pack of 8. I noticed that it was delivered in a 9-pack with one missing. The quantity delivered is right, just made me do a double take and grin, thinking of a shopkeeper putting individual jars on his shelves when he could have charged me a bit more for the entire pack and saved himself the hassle of opening all those flats to pull one out of each. Sort of an Apu-Simpsons moment.

review/summary: a little too salty for my taste
review/text: I will start by noting that I am a long time fan of Patak's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB1AXG">Patak's Mixed Relish, Hot, 10-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 6)</a> with their mixed pickle among my favorite things; (an understatement, I would almost call it an addiction  BUT *the* store which carries it locally has almost tripled the price, so I turned to Amazon... hoping, but, alas, they will not ship to Hawaii.<br /><br />I have found quite a few things here which are as good as, some even better than, my old "tried and true" and so I gave the MTR pickle a try.  The price is exceptional.  No complaints in that department, but I personally found this pickle a bit too salty.  The consistency is also different, not as chunky.<br /><br />Now these things are a matter of personal taste, likely more so with respect to food than anything else I can think of.  It is also a bit of a challenge to describe, particularly if you do not know, or necessarily share someone's personal taste.<br /><br />This is not a bad product and I can imagine a lot of people liking it more than I.  Any pickle is going to have a good deal of salt because... that's what a pickle is: something preserved in salt.  I tend to go lower on salt than most.  That said, if you like salty foods, you will like this better than I did.  I also prefer a chunkier consistency.  This pickle approaches a spread.  Again, this is not necessarily a bad thing, more a matter of personal taste.<br /><br />I like the spice blend in Patak's better as well, and this is the most difficult to describe as it is subtle and noone wants to detail their recipe(and I can not think of a single ingredient which stands out).  So, all I can say is that I did not like it as much<br /><br />The MTR pickle is also not as hot, and I personally like HOT.  This is a place where many people will not share my personal preference, as I know from experience that I eat food hotter than the vast majority of people (It was years before my husband could eat curries as hot as I tend to order or prepare them).<br />As Indian pickles go, in my experience, this is on the milder side.  Judging by the reviews I have read of several products here, *most* people will differ from my tastes in this area and probably prefer a relatively milder pickle.<br /><br />All that said, this is a condiment which one would add to bring up the heat in a dish, maybe make it a little more flavorful.  I frequently have Annies frozen entrees for lunch (quick, convenient and healthy); the ones available locally being the spinach and paneer, and one or 2 bean curries with rice.  i find them fairly bland and *always* add pickle (I think without the pickle I would not enjoy them, maybe not eat them at all!).  I think the MTR mixed pickle will work OK to spice up those bland dishes.  It is not something I am going to either throw or give away, however, it is also not something I would order again.<br /><br />I hope I have been able to provide a description which is adequate enough for people to decide whether or not this would be to their taste.  In sum, I found this pickle to be saltier and milder than what I am used to.  It also has a different consistency than most, being somewhat smoother and less chunky.  Again, none of these things is necessarily bad.  It is all a matter of personal taste.<br />Edited to note that by the time we got to the bottom of the first jar I had sussed out the ingredient which threw the taste, and my opinion off.  The "heat" is provided by paprika, rather than chile (which is what most or all of the other brands I have had use).  Paprika is nowhere near as hot a cayenne, or chile, and so much more is required to make this hot.  Ultimately it is not as hot, and the other flavors are somewhat diminished (because of the quantity of parika required).  if you like paprika you may like this, and if you don't, get another brand.

review/text: With six cats in the house, let me say I was THRILLED that Amazon.com offered this in their vine program. My cats eat anything that doesn't run away from them, but everyone from the year old cat, to the seventeen year old diabetic kitty LOVED this food. Even my mom's cat, who is known to be pretty finicky loved it.<br /><br />The food looks like "real" food, not the loaf-type food so often seen in canned cat food, and it smells great. Not stinky at all. The cats gobbled it right up, and I like that there is plenty of broth and liquid on the food, because that helps my eldest cat, who is missing several teeth, eat it just fine.<br /><br />I've been feeding wellness and Eagle Pack Holistic food in addition to prescription food. This ranks right alongside those expensive foods. Good stuff!!!!

review/text: Dash loves it. Jasper does not. Dash Hoovered both his bowl and Jasper's, while Jasper took two bites and then moved over to the kibble bowl. We've tried three different flavors so far, and the verdict has been the same. So safe to say, not ALL cats want to eat "people food." I don't know much about this product except what's on the label. The fact that it's a product of Thailand concerns me a bit -- I don't know what their standards are for pet food, and after the scandal with the lead in Chinese-manufactured toys, well, I'm a little skeptical. It's also an expensive product. Since I don't have a consensus among the house felines, I doubt I will purchase any more of this product.

review/summary: My Two Cats Inhaled The Stuff
review/text: OK, so I couldn't personally taste this cat food and give you a review. But all I can say is: my two cats (14 and 15 years old) virtually inhaled it. Clawdette is the older one and she is fussy. She likes a cat food that has seafood and tomato in it. Chappie is less picky, but he can turn up his nose at some supermarket brand cat foods. So more often then not I buy the canned cat food at petshops (or on Amazon). I fed them each of the cans in the Variety Pack...and its as if the food vanished off the face of the earth within a few minutes. The bottom line: they loved it, it left their coats nice and softy and glossy, and they had lots of energy. So I (or, rather my cats) give it five stars.

He clearly likes the broth in the Chicken Pot Pie, but he doesn't finish his vegetables, or even all of the chunks of chicken.<br /><br />Of course, we can hardly blame him for abandoning one can to attempt to get into the turkey liver I was cutting up.

I completely grossed my fiancee out when I tasted it and let me tell you as someone who is an avid cook the Chicken Pot Pie is very good. I make chicken pot pie and reading the ingredients were like reading the ingredients in a chicken pot pie you would make or buy for yourself. The chicken did not taste processed. The first time I saw the can of food I thought it was gourmet tuna and had to read to make sure it was cat food. I can't say that I blame my kitty for enjoying this so much. We have a local health food store that carries it so it's easy to find for me but the deals online are amazing! I'll be going via Amazon from now on. My cat reacts to this the way she reacts to fresh tuna, she goes nuts!

review/summary: More like "human" food than Cat Food
review/text: My cats are crazy for this food, including the one that has turned up her nose at all wet food for 6 years! Unfortunately the price makes it prohibitive as an every day meal since I have 5 cats. Also, I've heard that too much fish is not healthy for cats, they need meat too and they aren't that crazy about the Petite Cuisine Chicken.  I still buy the tuna and just feed it occasionally as an extra treat. The food itself looks and smells just like tuna for humans, maybe even a little better. Some of it has tiny little (whole) shrimp and some pieces of codfish - it also has a lot of tuna oil, which I guess is what the cats like about it because the first thing they do is lap up all the "gravy". I thought maybe if I bought human tuna in oil and spiked their usual soft Friskies, they would enjoy it more, but that didn't work, so I continue to buy Petite Cuisine.

review/summary: Hard to find cat food!
review/text: Directly above it says this review is FROM Petite Cuisine Cat Food. In actuality it is FOR Petite Cuisine Cat Food!!!<br /><br />I used to purchase this cat food at Winn-Dixie stores. About six months ago they stopped carrying it. Amazon was the only place I could find besides the manufacturer that would sell me this at retail. Since the manufacturer wanted an exorbitant amount for purchase at retail Amazon was the only retailer left. Fortunately for me the Amazon program of monthly purchases worked out perfectly. It enables me to buy the food at a price that is acceptable and keeps my cats happy at the same time.<br /><br />As far as the food itself is concerned all I can say is that the cats love it, and it gives them very healthy looking luxurious coats and satisfies their appetites at the same time. If you need a link to make a purchase cut and paste the following into your address bar: [...]

review/text: `I was very pleased to see this product online.  I always bought Baby Girls canned food at Food Lion and now they no longer carry it at the local store.  Every cat and kitten who has had the pleasure of trying it loves it.  NOT gummy or looks like mystery meat.  Great product.

review/summary: Otis will eat it!
review/text: Otis is what I call a very picky eater. The fact is, until now, he would not eat the same cat food twice! He is 10 years old.<br /><br />I was in the habit of buying food one can at a time for obvious reasons. I did that for the Petite Cusine as well....the Tuna and sole. He inhaled it. I bought 2 more. This time 2 different varsities of the same brand. Again....gone.<br /><br />Since it is not cheap, I looked for it on line. Amazon had the best deal and I bought 4 cases of variety packs. That was almost a year ago. He still loves it!<br /><br />The other things I like are the ingredients. They are healthy for him.....no fillers.

review/summary: Cats' meow
review/text: The cats should love these little jars of different wet flavors, and even you cats who are accustomed to dry food should like this.  You feel like you're giving them something healthful and gourmet when you serve them this.  The food is quite liquidly, which could be a good or bad thing depending on their and your preference.  Open a jar and serve it to them, and don't mistake it for tuna for yourself!

review/summary: Human food but apparently not cat food
review/text: It looks and smells really good. It has no harmful additives. It is in a cute package. It has names of food that I like. If only my cats could appreciate all of the above qualities! I wonder if other people's cats do. I couldn't find any fault with the food, but then again, I'm human. I'd say it probably depends very much on what your cat's taste is. If your cat enjoys fresh organic food... then buy this. If they like Fancy Feast - don't!!

review/summary: Ho Hum Response
review/text: Any review of this product, necessarily, must be based upon observation of the four footed furry feline friends (barring any truly dedicated and odd reviewers). We have two cats that deign to call us their owners, at least at feeding time and when the litter box needs cleaning.<br /><br />This is soft food in the petite cans favored by the feline haute cuisine products. However, the similarity seems to end there as the product is flaked rather than sliced or diced, and the sauce is clear with an oily consistency (somewhat like vegetable or olive oil), the pot pie cans were considerably more fluid.<br /><br />The boy, Otis, will eat just about any soft cat food put in front of him unfortunately we were disappointed with his response to this product. The girl, Crystal, is the pickier of the pair and will usually lick a little of the food or sauce before abandoning any soft food (leaving the remnants for Otis), but would not touch this product. I was gratified to see that the product did not come out of China after the problems of the past year.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the cats did not seem to like the product as much as other soft foods. The poor response from the cats means that this one will not make it into the rotation.

review/summary: Great cat food but it is a little pricy
review/text: My finicky cat LOVED these petite cuisines.  He would scarf them down.  The ingredients are wholesome, lots of juices and you could actually see the real tuna, mini shrimps and so forth.  The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because it is really expensive in the stores.  But if money is no object for your little 4 legged feline friends, then I highly recommend this cat food.

review/summary: A Feast For the Most Finnicky Furry Feline
review/text: This food is a delight to give to one of the most important members of the family.  She's a bit choosy & will walk away readily from many foods. So, it is really something to watch her just gobble this down!<br /><br />The smaller sized can is nice as well for it insures that she'll eat the whole thing-down to the carrots. With the larger cans, she'll leave a third or more sitting there and it goes to waste.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine may cost a bit more, but nutritionally it is a very good meal for the kitty and she likes it, so none goes uneaten!  So, in the long run, it is a good value.<br /><br />On inspection of the cat food, it is composed of very good ingredients and is a high quality product.<br /><br />Our kitty loves it and gobbles it down at one sitting!

The Chinese chicken is not as liquidy.<br /><br />I have no idea how to compare this to other brands price-wise because it is not sold in my state. I've never seen it in stores.

review/text: Well my mother has a couple cats so I thought what the heck I'll get this stuff for her to feed them instead of hard food all the time.<br /><br />The cats who will eat anything and everything that you put in front of them were little apprehensive of this product. Granted the one cat does like spicy food but he did eat it throughout the days. They both like it but it's hard for them to get a hold of the pieces because the chicken is kind of stringy and not cut into smaller pieces and some of it ends up on the floor.<br /><br />But now that they kind of used to these they do definitely practically yell at me when I don't give them the stuff as soon as I open the can, lol. But it would be better if it were smaller cut pieces to reduce the amount that ends up on the floor.

review/summary: Warning: Contains Menadione
review/text: According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione "produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung." Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats.

review/text: I don't know if it's typical or not, but our cat gets tired of any flavor of canned cat food after a while. Sometimes she'll eat a flavor one day, but turn up her nose at it a week later. We vary the flavors, but she's picky. We've been trying the Petite Cuisine for several weeks now, and the four different flavors seem to give her plenty of variety -- she hasn't refused it yet. Here's hoping that continues!

review/summary: Almost...
review/text: I've got 2 cats that love their wet food!!  We figured this'd be a big hit & for the 1st couple cans it was.  My cats are used to your everyday  mushy cat food (Friskies I think), so when we opened this stuff I was surprised to see that this stuff actually looked almost some what edible.  It kinda looked like tuna with peas & carrots, although it was really juicy (seemed like almost half the can was just liquid).  Anyway long story short the cats devoured this food when we first gave it to 'em.  However I must admit the cans were a little small for 2 cats, but a can this size would be perfect for a 1 cat family.  (Here comes the only 3 star rating part)  Anyway, after the 1st couple cans it seemed as though the cats loved it, but then, all of a sudden they just stopped eating it.  I gotta tell you with my cats that's a rare thing to be sure.  Everytime we've tried to give it to 'em since they've completely turned their noses from it.  I can't really say that this stuff isn't good, all I know is that suddenly my cats stopped liking it, your cats might love it.  Granted, my cats are used to the mushy stuff I mentioned earlier, but to be fare they also like canned tuna/chicken (it could just be the big veggie chunks they didn't like, who knows).  I guess in closing, it's kinda up in the air as to whether or not you'll get the most out of your purchase or not, I know I won't ever buy it again, but again your cats might love it, kinda hard to come to a real definative conclusion:(.

review/summary: The cats weren't impressed!
review/text: When I ordered the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack, I thought it would be a real treat for the seven cats in our household and that the cats would provide an unbiased and impartial panel of judges. When the package arrived, I gave Brio, our youngest (three years old) one of the Sesame Chicken cans. She gobbled it right down and licked the container clean. Good sign! While she was scarfing down the food, I read the packaging and was impressed with the ingredients and the quality of the food. I was a little disturbed that the food comes from Thailand, but proceeded since I haven't read of any problem pet food coming out of Thailand. When I opened a can of the Chicken Pot Pie, I was amazed that it was mostly gravy - a few bits of chicken and some carrots, but mostly sauce (all of the cans were like that - not just the first one). Charlie (aged 16) liked the sauce but wouldn't touch the solids. For a couple of days, I only put out the Petite Cuisine wet food, and most of it just sat there. Hmmmmmm. With seven cats, you'd think at least one of them would clean it up. One of the claims on the packaging is that there isn't the odor from this food that there is in other brands, and that's very true WHEN THE FOOD IS FRESH. I learned the hard way that it smells just as bad as any other cat food when it's been sitting out for more than a day. My next test was to put out a can of Friskies wet food and a can of Petite Cuisine at feeding time for several days. The Friskies went right down and the Petite Cuisine just sat there. I used the whole case eventually, but have to admit that quite a bit of it went down the toilet. Amazon's case price is a little under $1 per three-ounce can, so that's kind of expensive to have to flush down the drain. My advice would be to not buy several cases of Petite Cuisine initially - see if your cat likes it first. Mine sure weren't impressed!

review/text: This is basically shredded white chicken in a seasoned gravy like broth. ALL 5 of my cats inhaled it and licked their bowls clean. It appears as human grade food. That said,and since it is not organic, it is more cost effective to buy a can of broth, add some seasoning and add a mashed can of chicken. I think the cost of this cat food for the convenience is not worth it-now if it were a 5-6 oz. can, then I probably would think it was a reasonable trade off. Just a note-the greatly higher amount of chicken you get in this flavor vs. the pot pie watery flavor is considerable.

review/text: My cats really seem to like this food. It does look like people food (the tuna and shrimp variety even has little shrimps in it). It is quite a bit more expensive than my usual brand of canned cat food (Fancy Feast), but it obviously contains whole seafood, which Fancy Feast does not.<br /><br />I dinged it one star because it is very watery, but otherwise I have no complaints. Unlike some canned cat foods, Petite Cuisine does not smell bad (as long as you don't mind a fishy smell). I would buy this again if I saw it on sale, but I probably wouldn't pay full price for it.

review/summary: the kitty she is purring
review/text: I haven't tried this product myself, although it does smell yummy and is marketed as "People Food for Cats."  Our cat seems to like it better than her regular canned food, Fancy Feast.  Nutritionally it seems on a par, but at more than a buck a can I wonder whether "people food for cats" is really "ploy for people who think their cats are people."<br /><br />It is nice to know that, if we're snow bound for a few days, we can eat the cat's food.

review/summary: Loved by more than half.
review/text: Out of 4 cats, one simply wouldn't go near it, one liked the broth and played with the food and the remaining 2  liked it immensely (nom nom nom). The cans are a good single serving size and it really smells like human food. Literally, they smell like cold leftovers. The food is in a broth and very wet, which your cat may or may not like. They only similarity in cats is that they are all different.<br /><br />To be fair, the one that didn't like it is insanely picky.  The food is not overly processed and I am happy to feed this to my cats. When I saw that it was made in Thailand, I was a bit wary as we all have heard about the melamine in, well, everything, in China. Then reading further, I saw the company addresses this and says that the food doesn't use Chinese products.  They seem a thoughtful company at the least, which when it comes to pets, goes a long way with me.<br /><br />As good as the food may seem to me, they are the ones that have to eat it.  It's a little more expensive, but not prohibitively so, especially if your cat likes it.

review/summary: It's OK for some cats... But not all.
review/text: Of my three cats, only one likes this food. I suspect the problem is that there are actual chunks of carrot in the food, and most cats aren't fond of carrots blocking the smell of the chicken in their meal. While the ingredients list is admirable, the chunks of chicken are very appetizing-looking, and it does appear to be as advertised- All natural- it's also not very popular in my household.<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie flavor is especially disliked by my cats, as it's very watery. The label describes this as a sauce, but it's really more like a weak broth that apparently tastes more like carrots than chicken, because even my chicken-mooching cat will not consume it. The Sesame Chicken flavor is a little more interesting to him, but he still just picks out the bigger chunks of chicken when he's really desperate, and leaves the carrots behind.<br /><br />Honestly, I really can't believe any cat would eat those carrots!<br /><br />My suggestion is to try before you commit to this size of a package, because cats' tastes vary, and in my experience, 2 out of 3 cats will only eat it if they're very, very hungry. The third is the kind of cat that will eat anything, and so she'll dig in. If you have a cat that will eat anything, then you might have some luck with this food. If your cats are a bit more picky about their food, then you may want to hold back and see if you can dig up a single can before buying a 24-pack like this.<br /><br />I respect what the company is trying to do with their food, but I really question the person who decided they were going to put chunks of vegetables in a cat food. Cats are carnivores, and sticking a carrot in their bowl is kind of an insult to them.<br /><br />...And we all know that insulting a cat when it comes to food is one of the greatest sins against cat pride one can commit.<br /><br />Remove the carrots, thicken the "sauce" and you might have something here.

review/summary: High quality - two paws up!
review/text: My cat enjoyed this food very much. He is an older cat and can be finicky. He *really* showed great interest in this brand, and liked the amount of juice in the food.  He preferred the chunky chicken in the pot pie flavor rather than the shredded chicken in the sesame entree, but hey he ate both with gusto!<br /><br />So if you have a picky eater, who likes a fair bit of gravy, this could be a winner for you!

review/summary: 5 PURRS FOR THIS DISH
review/text: Our cat is 6-years-old and has eaten (voraciously) the same brand of food in both the chow and the canned variety for all of his life.  He's not at all a picky eater (even given to nabbing a potato chip if he can).<br /> Nonetheless, we were a bit reluctant to try a new brand of food but no worries there.  With his first can of the Petit Cuisine Chicken Pie we knew we'd found a winner.  He didn't hesitate for a second, not even the unfamiliar smell slowed him down.  He seemed to particularly enjoy the liquid, lapping every bit of it.  A full tummy, a grateful rub of my shin,  and he slept for a few hours.  What a life!<br /> Five purrs for Petite Cuisine!

review/summary: Good quality, but ultimately it depends on the cat's personality
review/text: I have been giving this food to my cat for a couple of days, and I have mixed feelings about it. The chicken pot pie flavor has a lot of broth in it. Fortunately, my cat likes broth, and whenever I buy food that has either a lot of sauce or a lot of broth, my cat enjoys the extra moisture. However, this depends on your cat. What I found, however, is that the chicken pot pie has more broth than actual food.  The chicken is very chunky and looks very natural, and is exactly the consistency my cat enjoys.  However, it contains carrots, and my cat doesn't really eat vegetables. Cats in general don't eat vegetables, because they are naturally carnivores, so I question its inclusion.<br /><br />The Chinese Chicken is actually "sesame". It has a slightly odd aroma, which doesn't seem to bother my cat, and plenty of sauce, which my cat enjoys. However, the meat in this flavor is shredded, which my cat does not enjoy. It has fewer vegetables than the chicken pot pie, but my cat will barely touch the meat in this.<br /><br />From a nutritional perspective, these foods have about the same (or slightly better) protein content than my cat's regular brands. This is a plus, especially if you have an overweight cat. This food contains plenty of protein and plenty of moisture, which are really critical in quality cat food.<br /><br />Based on what I've seen, I would conclude that these are quality cat foods. They look better than what my cat eats on a regular basis. Ultimately, though, it depends what your cat enjoys -- consider the consistencies I've described before buying. In my situation, since my cat will not eat the Chinese "Sesame" Chicken, I have quite a few cans of food that I will not be able to use -- an issue of the mult-flavor, multi-pack design.

review/summary: GOOD GOURMET CAT FOOD
review/text: Feeding this to my 12 year old cat, she enjoyed the chicken pot pie quite a bit...and went through an entire can in one sitting. (Not sure if this is a good or a bad thing though!) The chinese chicken she ate, but didnt seem thrilled about. Giving a container to two other cat owners produced the same results. So, if I were to buy in the future, which I very well may, I would hope I could buy a carton of the Chicken Pot Pie by itself. But all in all this is quality food, and seemed to sit in my mature cats stomach easily - very important as all pet owners are still very cautious after last years awful pet food poisonings.

review/summary: Got Diarrhea?
review/text: This is an edit so I was unable to change my star rating.  At first I was happy with this canned cat food until the trouble began.  It has caused severe diarrhea in both of my cats who were eating it.  Now I'm in the process of trying to get things back on track.  As anyone who has been in this situation knows, the negative impacts of the situation affect the entire household, not just the poor cats who are suffering from it.

review/summary: my 10 cat review.....
review/text: yes, that's right, our family has 10 cats (all rescues), so you can imagine I was pretty stoked when this product came up for review.<br /><br />Now, since I have so many cats, my cats normally only get can food as a treat, maybe once a month. About a third LOVE can food, a third can take it or leave it, and the last third do not like can food at all. When I tried this product on my cats, over two thirds gobbled it up, only one or two showed no interest, and one (who has a sensitive stomach anyway) got sick within five minutes of consumption.<br /><br />The product has a lot of "juice", which I find my cats tend to enjoy. The smell wasn't overpowering like many cat foods.<br />In conclusion, I'd buy Petite Cuisine for my cats but only as a treat.<br />3.5 stars.

review/summary: My cats seem to like it
review/text: When reviewing cat food, you really can't go with taste since cat food is disgusting, but my cats really seem to like it. When I open a can they run to the bowl. Not that they don't usually run to the bowl but they are very enthusiastic about this stuff.<br /><br />The main problem I have is that it's in little cans so there's not much. I have three cats. And it's a little too watery. The food and "gravy" quotient is heavy on the "gravy" side. Also it stinks a little. Most cat food stinks but I distinctly smelled this one. So it stinks more than usual.<br /><br />Beyond that, if you can afford it and you have finicky cats, give it a shot.

review/summary: Kitties love it!
review/text: This is a high quality seafood based sampler pack of wet cat food. I have two cats that primarily eat dry food, yet every once in a while they get a can of something. I tried this brand and was impressed. The meat is visible and appears minimally processed (looks like canned tuna, for example). The cats just love it and are awaiting their next turn!

review/summary: A bit watery, but impressive ingredients
review/text: With all the nonsense about pet food recalls and melamine, it's important to know where your pet food originates. This food does not originate in China and contains no wheat gluten. The chicken pot pie is a bit too watery to me so one star down. However, watery is not necessarily bad as it provides additional hydration for cats that eat dry food. All three of my cats do eat dry food (Nutro). I like to provide them with moist food on the side to encourage their appetite and hydration. I am frankly scared of most canned foods available because of the melamine thing. The cheap ones have ingredients almost always originating in China, and the expensive ones aren't cost effective for me to provide as a snack. This food does fill that gap in that it averages a dollar a can (through Amazon, less through subscribe and save) and it contains high grade (human grade) ingredients. I thought about putting my cats on a raw food diet (BARF for cats). It's messy, requires counter space, time and storage space for ingredients and the finished product. Therefore I try to get the best dry food I can and supplement it with canned food like this.<br /><br />All three cats liked both varieties of food. 3 cats = 2 cans once a day. The dry food is at will - they munch on that when they like. So far, so good. No increased mess in litter box from soupy ingredients, either. Their appetites remain strong for both this wet food and their dry food.

review/summary: Nutritious but...
review/text: I do have to say that the cat food is quite nutritious and appealed to my cat's sense of smell as well as my visual sense.  He also did not throw up this food, which is a rarity for my sensitive-stomached cat.  On the downside, he didn't eat much of it, either.  I don't know what about it didn't interest him beyond a few bites, but most of it got left in his bowl.  My dog, on the other hand, loves it!  I give three stars because it's potentially interesting to other cats, but mine wouldn't eat more than a little bit of it.  I gave some to a friend, and her cats loved it.

review/summary: I have three cats
review/text: I typically feed them dry food, and once a day I split a can of Fancy Feast to give them a treat with their supper.<br />They love it. They have never turned down any canned cat food. Sometimes one will refuse or just nibble at a particular flavor, but they usually like their canned food<br /><br />I tried out both flavors on my three kitties, None of them did more than nibble, I tried it on my dog, just out of curiosity, He ate it . Continuing my experiment, I went to my friend Margie's house. She has three cats as well. Much like my feline family, one is a senior and two are young. Sadly, I had the same result. None of them liked it.<br /><br />Before receiving the food I looked online to learn as much as I could about this food before subjecting my furkids to it. Everything looked good, safe and worthy of Morgan, Rosie and Emmie. I was quite disappointed that they don't like it, to tell you the truth. It looked so good that I really wanted them to like it.I will be dropping off the rest of it at the shelter tomorrow. I certainly do not want it to go to waste, as it is a good quality product.

review/summary: One Cat Liked it and One Cat Hated It
review/text: One of my cats liked this food, although not as much as he liked the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety Cat Food, and my other cat wouldn't touch this food; however, she does like the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety. This variety of food comes with chunks of chicken, chunks of vegetables and gravy. I'm guessing my finicky cat was turned off by the vegetable chunks. On the positive side these cans are easy to open and you can pour the food out without having to use a spoon. However, because one of my cats wouldn't touch this food I won't buy it again. I'll stick with the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety Cat Food.

review/summary: Cats Love  It
review/text: My two cats love this seafood variety canned food. One of my cats is very finicky, so I was surprised when she gobbled up this food without hesitation. The cans are small, easy to open, and you don't need a spoon to get the food out. You can easily pour the food out of the can, as it is a mixture of small chunks of seafood and gravy. I divide a can of this food between my two cats morning, lunch and evening, so my cats are eating about a can and a half each of this food daily. My cats' fur is shiny and they are both active and content. I recommend this food and will purchase it again.

review/summary: Looks and smells high-quality, kitty likes it
review/text: My cat, who is of average pickiness, loved both of the chicken varieties.<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken looks and smells appealing, even to humans.  It's very recognizable as shredded white-meat chicken, finely diced carrots, and broth.  No chopped-and-formed meat by-products here!<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie variety is a little smellier, but not as bad as typical cat food.  It is fairly soupy, but my cat lapped it right up.  She even ate the carrots, which I would not have anticipated.<br /><br />Both products list high-quality ingredients on the label.  There is no wheat gluten, so hopefully this product is less susceptible to the melamine poisonings that have occurred with other brands.  It is made in Thailand, and I don't know what that means in terms of pet food safety.<br /><br />I like the size of the mini-cans, as they are just right for one meal for one cat.  I hate keeping smelly half-open cans of pet food in the refrigerator!
