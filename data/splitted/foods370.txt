review/summary: The Same
review/text: As boring as Pudding sometimes sound when suggested for dessert it is still as creamy and chocolaty as it always been. The Same taste but never the less makes a good snack or dessert. Sugar Free is an added plus so Jell-O get 4 Stars, if only for its long tradition of being served at all different kinds of tables.

review/summary: Hard to Infuse Without Making a Mess
review/text: Strictly speaking, there is nothing wrong with this tea.<br /><br />The problem is that it is a fine powder, so fine that I don't see a good way to infuse it.<br /><br />The particles are small enough to escape most infusers.  The only solution I can think of would be a cotton tea "sock" - yes, sock is a legitimate term used in the tea business.<br /><br />Ordinarily I am a snob in terms of preferring loose leaf to tea bags.  However, due to the fineness of these particles, this is one instance where a tea bag would be preferable.<br /><br />For practical purposes I would only recommend this item in the tea bag version.

review/summary: Flavorful, Tart, & Rich ...
review/text: I was drawn to this tea when I first saw it as I love all tart flavors - alone and enhancing many other foods.  This tea is recognizably lime but definitely is an exotic, earthy, and complex flavor.<br /><br />I have abandoned most other herbal and herbal blend teas - keeping only this, Celestial Seasonings� Sleepytime�, and Numi� Mate Lemon on a regular basis.<br /><br />This loose Dry Desert Lime herbal teasan is easily  brewed in my ingenuiTEA pot <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPN8TK">Adagio Teas ingenuiTEA Dispensing Teapot 16-oz.</a>.  I also buy the individual bag package for convenience and keep them in my purse and desk.<br /><br />If you already have available or decide to purchase the Desert Dry Lime and you like red lentils, try  Lentil Lime Soup recipe on the Numi� site.  It is flavored with this brewed teasan.<br /><br />And lastly,  if you are as crazy as I about tart lemon and lime in and on many foods, I encourage you to try the amazing True Lemon and True Lime packets!  It comes in various carton sizes but once you're hooked, the True Lemon 500 Bulk Case is great!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CDIE4Y">True Lemon 40 Count Box</a>

review/summary: I don't like the taste
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker and though this tea is quite "limey" and strongly flavored (good quality I suppose), you should really buy a small amount of this to decide whether you like it or not before going for the 16 oz bag. It is VERY strong tasting and a bit musty. I generally like most all teas yet this tea left a "sour" taste in my mouth and I never could get used to it. Approach with caution.

review/text: Somebody brought this tea to work and left it in the cabinet, presumably because they didn't like it.  I can see how it wouldn't be for everyone, but if you like a sour citrus flavor, you will love this tea.  The fragrance reminds me of lime Sweet-Tarts with an undertone of cedar.  The flavor is very tart, but adding sugar makes it far less so.  It is a complex tea that might just end up being your favorite.

review/text: Let me start by saying that I love tea. I love Numi's teas the best as they are organic and also fair trade products. I have purchased many of Numi's other fine teas through both Amazon.Com & Numi in the past.<br /><br />However, the Dry Desert Lime tea is the first flavor of tea I couldn't stand the taste of at all! The Dry Desert Lime tea is tart, smells and tastes medicinal and looks like coffee when brewed. Let's just say the Dry Desert Lime flavor isn't my cup of tea!

review/summary: Is Frequent Use Bad for Your Teeth?
review/text: I love the flavor of this tea. I subscribed to it in bulk to have caffeine free tea for most of the day. After drinking it each day for a month, I remembered that the acid in citrus juice is bad for the teeth for those who drink too much. I don't know what the pH of this tisane is, but enamel loss begins at a pH of 5.5. This tea taste to me sourer than a pH of 5.5. I cancelled my bulk subscription. Maybe I am wrong and this tea is teeth friendly, but until we know for sure I would urge people to drink this in moderation. But please do try it. It is delicious.

review/summary: Worst Fruit Slices I have ever tasted!
review/text: I was really hopeful when I ordered these Fruit Slices.  It had been a long time since I had eaten any Fruit Slices, and was hoping to spark a delicious memory from my childhoood!  BUT, I was so disappointed when I ate my first slice - yes, I ate the entire piece, HOPING that the flavor would get better, but alas, the flavor did not improve.  The slice I tasted was supposedly watermelon, but all I could taste was a bitter, sour fruit.  I took one bite tastes of the other flavors, and couldn't tell much difference in any of the flavors, other than a bitter, sour fruit taste.  So - save your money, and look for a different brand of fruit slices to buy!

review/text: I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle. I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace' brand Oolong.<br /><br />After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.<br /><br />What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.<br /><br />I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the 'Tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />Ken

The pureed consistency makes it super easy to mix in with their dry food. I keep some cans on hand for the days when my dogs are being finicky with their food -- or I just feel like giving them an extra treat!<br /><br />The ingredient list speaks for itself.

review/text: We once randomly bought some of this in a grocery store, and then spent quite a while trying to find it again.  By a great stroke of luck we found it here at Amazon.<br /><br />What we like about it is that we can add lots of great curry flavor without adding too much fire.  We've observed that almost all other brands load up with cayenne pepper or some other inexpensive spice to make it seem that the curry is "strong" or "potent" at the expense of flavor.  If we want more fire we'll just buy cayenne.<br /><br />Anyway, this stuff is different.  It gives you the freedom to dump in a bunch and then optionally tailor the fire to the tastebuds of you or your guests.

review/summary: Consistent and Classic
review/text: This is the curry powder I started with years ago. As I got more into Indian cuisine, I tried other brands and even mixed my own blends, but this still has the benchmark flavor for home cooking. The pepper, ginger, and other elements are in perfect balance making it a great seasoning for any protein or veggie. The only adjustment you have to make at home is with salt or red pepper.

review/summary: One sniff and you'll be sold
review/text: If you compare the price of this to one of the bigger-name American spice producers like Durkee or Spice Island, prepare to be shocked. Especially when you consider that the big named ones have sat on the shelf longer than this one has. What makes me the voice of authority? I am a buyer at a small grocery store.<br /><br />Price aside, this curry is far superior. Just smell it! Divine... Yes, it is a bit saltier than other curry powders out there; just keep in mind that you don't need to add any more salt to a dish. A quick meal can be made by dumping a good measure of this curry powder in a pot with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036QLLL2">Thai Kitchen Unsweetened First Pressing Coconut Milk (95% Organic),13.66 -Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> and whatever veggies/tofu/meats you have on hand. Basically, you just stir, heat and eat. For a lip smacking snack, sprinkle the curry on sweet potato fries. Yummy! I've also tried a bit mixed into my egg salad, tuna salad and macaroni & cheese with wonderful results.

review/text: Great coffee for an excellent price!  I decided to give this coffee a try because it is organic decaf and such a great price, and I was pleasantly surprised by its rich flavor without any bitterness.  I can make a strong cup of coffee without the flavor being bitter.  If you like a medium roast with rich underlying notes, and you drink decaf then this is definitely worth trying!

review/text: I've tried several brands of organic SWP decaf, all ordered from Amazon and this is the best value.  I didn't give it 5 stars just because it's not super-memorable, but the flavor competes well with the other brands.  The package states that the beans should be used within a month for best flavor.  (I transfer small amounts into a coffee can for daily use, and keep the bag tightly sealed.)  I hesitated at first to buy such a large bag......what if it was awful?  So I was pleasantly surprised.

review/text: This is an amazing brand.  I don't like garlic, and they mostly do sauces without it.  It seems the manufacturers of pasta consider garlic to be a centerpiece of their sauce, but in fact, there is no need to stick it everywhere, and the taste is better without it.  The sauces of this brand are the best I tried.  Furthermore, this sauce tastes very flavorful and authentic Italian, where, unlike in the USA, garlic does not permeate every tomato sauce.

Well, until I found the Green & Black brand (actually discovered the dark chocolate with ginger, another winner); browsed in amazon at the other tasty options (always dangerous for me);  only comes in minimum pack of 10: terrible really, but a temporary issue!  The fact it is dark chocolate takes away the guilt and it is all about healthy options, as are nuts and fruit, right?  The taste is devine, just the right amount of finely chopped nuts and fruit.  I hope they keep the price competive as a I am sure to come back to this seller and amazon:  how about putting this one on save and subscribe!

review/text: Since we have been following the package directions that say to feed 10 treats at one time, our cat rarely throws up at all and her stools are plumper. She has always had tiny, hard stools until we started feeding her these treats. We can tell by her stool if she hasn't had a 10 treat dose in a couple of days. She eats these as readily as any other packaged treat we give her. A great find as cleaning up grassy vomit almost every day was getting quite tedious! The auto ship feature is also a big plus. We can't always get these treats here on our island when we need them. Thanks Amazon!

I've taught them to do tricks using these treats because the cats want them so much that if they can figure out what I'm asking, they do it to get the treat!  But they are smart boys.<br /><br />I don't like some other treats because they are as small as kibble.  These are big enough for me to hold between two finger tips while the cats take them.<br /><br />My cats ask for these each night around treat time.  One of my cats eats dry food almost exclusively (no canned food, no meat scraps, etc) and he is often the first to ask for these treats.

We can mix different brands together in a pile, and he will pull the Temptations treats out with his paw and leave the others. Its unreal. Either they just hit the jackpot with the perfect cat-seducing ingredients, or they have some sort of addictive substance in them.... who knows! :) I only give them 4 stars because they are not the "healthiest" treat for a cat, but honestly... he just loves them so much I cant say no.

review/summary: Maybe too good, cats don't want anything else!
review/text: We occasionally feed a couple stray cats as they are good at keeping the mice and snakes away. Once in awhile we will give them some of these Temptations Cat Treats and they are crazy about them! They will only eat the regular cat food if their efforts at getting more of the Temptations Treats doesn't work. One of them will sit at the door and meow and meow but eventually goes and eats the regular food. We have tried all the different varieties of Temptations Treats and they don't have a preference, they like all of them. If you want something to really great to give your cat, try any variety of the Temptations Cat Treats but be prepared for your cat to start begging for these all the time. The one thing we cannot tell is how good nutritionally these are for cats, the package says 100% nutritionally complete but not sure what that means in this case. Even if you could feed a cat these alone, that would be way too expensive so for now I will balance a few treats with regular varieties of dry cat food.

Cats Have Staff."<br /><br />Maybe he needs his own Amazon account?  No, that would be too dangerous.  I can see a garage filled to the brim with cat toys and a house furnished with nothing but cat trees, live birds, and bowls of goldfish...<br /><br />Try these treats; you won't be disappointed (and neither will your cat, which may be most important)!

My white cat MAY eat a couple if I don't ask to much attention in the process, otherwise he doesn't bother.  I don't know what the difference is but I like them because they don't stink and are easy to regulate piece by piece.

review/summary: Excellent cat treats
review/text: I've been buying cat treats for many years. Of the brands and types that are still on the market, I find that Whiskas Temptations is the one treat that all cats love. They come in several flavors. My cats like the Hearty Beef and Turkey flavors best. Pricing can be an issue as I have noticed continual price increases in this product for the last few years. Shop around and get them where you find the best price. Currently, the best price is about $1.35 per 3 oz. bag. But I,ve seen them at prices up to around $2 per bag.

Even if you just say "yellow bag" the little ears perk up and they are ready to pounce.  Don't have any idea what makes them so irresistable but they obviously are.  I know other people who have had the same experience with their cats.  Too bad chocolate doesn't have 2 calories per piece like this does.

review/text: My cat gets one Whiskas Temptation treat whenever I do her nails. She's always been very compliant, but the treats have made her jello in my arms.

review/summary: Cat's are fickel
review/text: My cat's are spoiled, I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there, but probably more spoiled than most.  The price of most cat treats and even some canned food is cheaper than Wally World, especially with a subscription.  These particular treats they love, until they get too many of them and then they want something different.  I tend to have four or five varieties on hand at any given time.  One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.  But they also like other flavors much of the time.  Price is a little more but packages are larger.  One strange thing with Amazon, different flavors of cat treats are different prices, even though they are all Temptations, Friskies, Party Mix, or whatever.

review/text: We have two cats.  One is a large black Bombay 4 years old.  The other a Teal Tabby 2 years old.  We love our kitties.  They are our family.  We tried every cat treat we could find and many large animal supply (and small) chain stores and neither Chester or Pumpkin would have anything to do with them except turn up their nose and walk away.  Then we came on "Temptations".  Now, unfortunately, they whine for them all day.  But, loving parents as we are, they usually get them.  An inexpensive and tasty treat.  They get the best food, and now thanks to "Temptation" the best treats.  All they need to get now is a JOB!

review/text: My 4 month old kitten usually eats another variety of Whiskas Temptations (Chicken Flavor Dentabites, which he LOVES!), but he's gotten into the habit of eating my hair that I've shed and that's fallen on the floor(gross, I know), so I decided to get him this hairball control variety of Whiskas Temptations.  The fine print on the package says that it should not be used on kittens less than 6 months of age.  I didn't notice this until after I bought and opened the package.  Hopefully, they'll stay fresh for another 2 months.

review/text: So my cat loves these things. She practically hisses at me at random times and jumps on the counter throws the bag on the floor and starts swatting the bag all over the house. I then put them in the cubbard and I found her in the cubbard one day crying to get out. Its insane. She acts like someone on crack. Im starting to question what they put in these. Is there really a lot of regulation regarding cat snacks. I doubt it. Ive tried to stop giving them to her but she then turns her back to me and pouts for days to weeks on end. It has taken me a while to figure out what was going on with her and I have narrowed it down to these Temptation snacks. Im concerned about what drugs they put in these.

review/text: I found these in a local Petco and decided to try them with my friend's cat. The cat has gone crazy for these things! I've never seen this cat walk around on two legs, try to climb my arm to get to the treat in my hand, or reach into a bag to try to get to the contents before I gave her some of these. The name is very fitting, but the real temptation is for we humans to keep giving just *one* more treat to the cat over and over again to enjoy the fun reactions.

review/summary: My cat goes bananas for Temptations
review/text: I have a very tall, lean, long-legged male cat. He doesn't eat much. I put out the finest wet food and he shows barely any interest. I buy expensive dry food to supplement his main meals. Eh, he could take or leave it. I even tried giving him high-end tuna from a can--the kind people eat--and he hardly nibbled at it. He just doesn't have much of an appetite, or so I thought. When I sprinkle a handful of these treats on a napkin, he furiously eats them all up. When I open the cabinet where I keep them, he comes running from wherever he is in the house. He seems to like all the flavors equally (chicken, beef, salmon - doesn't matter). Temptations is the only food I can count on his eating on a consistent basis. I could never train him or manipulate him with food before because nothing ever motivated him. These treats motivate him. If I need to calm him down for a brushing or a nail trimming, Temptations will work the magic. Thank you, Temptations.

review/text: Of course, my cats deserve only the best so I began giving them treats to elicit a desired behavior in them.  Little did I know this would backfire and they would elicit a desired behavior in ME!<br /><br />Not only do they LOVE these (and a couple of other flavors), they have now learned when it 10pm, which is treat time and time to leave the bedroom.<br /><br />By 930pm the vultures are starting the circle me on bed while staring at me; at 945 they start to softly vocalize; by 10pm they hoist me on their little backs and carry me to the drawer where the treats live while in full complaining voice.  I obey and give them an equal number of treats in the hallway, quickly locking the bedroom door behind me. Why lock it?  We have lever type doorhandles and the male has learned to open the bedroom since "Treat Time" started, will march back in and demand more.<br /><br />Did Dr Frankenstein realized the monster he created?
