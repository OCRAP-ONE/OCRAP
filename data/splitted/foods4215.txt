review/summary: My Favorite Cereal!
review/text: Nature's Path is my favorite cereal brand, and OPTIMUM Blueberry is my favorite of them all.<br /><br />I've been enjoying this cereal for well over 5 years.<br />It's organic, and full of wonderful beneficial whole grains etc. - just read the ingredients list!<br />It has a mixture of textures, with "twigs", "puffs", flakes, seeds and the little dried blueberries.<br />It's great with soy milk, dairy milk, yogurt, and even right out of the box as a snack.<br /><br />I haven't bought it for awhile because it never seems to go on sale anymore, so I was thrilled to find it here on sale for $2.20 a box!<br /><br />I just got my shipment from Amazon, and want to add a few notes:<br />While the cereal seems very fresh, I couldn't find an expiration date anywhere on the boxes.<br />They have changed the packaging, making it even more eco-friendly, and also slightly reformulated the cereal. The box says "Now with 25% less sugar than our previous recipe" Yay!  (Don't worry, if you've had this cereal before the change, the taste is still wonderful.) So the "Nutrition Facts" have changed (not drastically) from what Amazon shows, but the fiber has dropped from 10g to 7g. The serving size is still the same at 1 cup (55g).<br /><br />Here are some of the differences that may be important to you:<br />Calories were 190, now 200<br />Protein was 8g, now 9g<br />Total Fat was 2.5g, now 3g (Still none are saturated fat)<br />Total Carbs were 40g, now 38g<br />Fiber was 10g, now 7g (Boo!)<br />Sugars were 16g, now 9g (Yay!)<br />Sodium was 200mg, now 230mg<br /><br />The cinnamon flavor is very mild, I usually add more for flavor and health benefits. I also add a small amount of walnuts (for extra EFA's, taste and crunch), or pecans. Read Update below for more additions.<br /><br />Unless you are hooked on the average sickeningly-sweet, unhealthy, over-processed mainstream cereals, I think you will love this as much as I do! If you want to try a box before you buy it in bulk here, I've found it at most health food stores, Fry's / Kroger's in their health food sections, and Sprouts.<br /><br />Even if you are hooked on the other stuff, give this a try, you might be pleasantly surprised. I had bought this for my parents and their verdict is: Dad loves it, Mom likes it.<br /><br />Update 6/6/09: I just responded with these comments in another review, and thought they might be helpful:<br /><br />I too would enjoy more berries in the cereal, but it would probably make the price astronomical, so I usually add a little of "Just Tomatoes" brand of freeze dried mixed fruit which is yummy and has a good mix of fruit - though I could do without the raisins, they're not so good freeze dried.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QV4">Just Tomatoes Just Fruit Munchies, 8-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />They also have only blueberries<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGAJP0">Just Tomatoes Just Blueberries, 8-Ounce Tub</a><br />plus strawberries, raspberries, apples, pineapple etc. just search "just tomatoes" - without quotes - in the grocery drop down in the search box.<br /><br />I first found them at my local upscale grocery store (in smaller sized containers) and they are a little less expensive here, but I also like to support the local store, so I buy them from both places.<br /><br />There is another brand that I haven't tried, but has gotten great reviews called Traverse Bay that has dried blueberries<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5YDO">Traverse Bay Dried Blueberries, 8-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7ELTM">Traverse Bay Dried Blueberries, 4 lbs</a><br /><br />You don't need to use a whole lot in the cereal so they last for awhile. One tip is to keep them in the freezer so they stay crunchy.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/text: This cereal is my mainstay.  While trying to keep my weight down, it's a great snack to grab instead of something not near as healthy.  I can no longer find it in any of the nearby stores, so I have it delivered monthly from Amazon.  Really helpful.  A healthy, delicious cereal for kids and adults.

review/text: Don't know if I got a bad batch, but I'm on the 3rd box (of a 6-pack) and there are NOT 7 blueberries among the 3 boxes.  Also, no cinnamon flavor.  Very disappointing since I've tried their Flax Red Berry which was very flavorful.  Will not get again.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: I have to agree with Renbur about the sodium.  I bought a box of this cereal at the grocery store to see if I liked it before ordering from Amazon, and I'm glad I did.  It's tasty and nicely filling but it's so salty that I end up drinking water all day.  Comparing it with other cereals it's one of the highest on sodium: 230 mg for a one cup serving (this is up from the amount of sodium shown on Amazon).<br /><br />I already order Heart to Heart from Amazon, and like it.  Now I'm looking for a cereal to give me a change.  Any suggestions?

review/summary: Whole grain flakes and crunchy fiber twigs.
review/text: Who would ever believe it would be enticing to hear a cereal product called a "crunchy fiber twig"?  Well, it actually did appeal to me because I get so tired of nothing but mush in my cereal bowl as soon as I add the liquid.  And this product did not disappoint, at least not where crispiness was concerned.  I liked reading the box with the folksy, down home feeling used to convey the basic philosophy of the company and their own naturally biased view of their product.  As always though, it's up to the consumer to separate the hype from the facts.<br /><br />The box I bought in the grocery store is different from the one pictured here and I think there has been recent repackaging and reformulating of the cereal.  I notice here on Amazon that the product description specifically says there is no vitamin B12 or Folic Acid in this product so that must have been a sticking point before.  I found that the cereal itself had a quite nice "nutty" taste and the fiber twigs are very crunchy.  A serving size is quoted to be 3/4 cup which is 200 calories.  The sugar content per serving is 9g and sodium count is 230mg.  The description of the sugar source is "evaporated cane juice".  From reading the nutritional list I know not to count on this cereal to supply any appreciable amount of my daily requirements for vitamins or minerals.  There are 13 ingredients listed for this cereal.  I find it quite interesting that it is called Blueberry Cinnamon Flax when flax is listed as ingredient #5, blueberries as #10 and cinnamon as #12.  But something we consumers can easily forget is that these ingredients are listed in order of their volume within the combination.  I poured out some dry cereal and tasted each item separately.  There is a definite sweet coating on each piece with the exception of the blueberries which have a concentration of their own sweetness from being freeze-dried.<br /><br />My findings are that the flakes get soggy almost immediately but the "crunchy fiber twigs" stayed crunchy all the way to the final twig, and I'm a dawdler over my cereal.  It took me more than 15 minutes to finish the bowl because I was reading and the twigs were still crisp.  This cereal does not contain flax SEEDS and it never claims to.  If you are expecting seeds, you will be disappointed.  There are not many blueberries, but the ones here are very flavorful.  In order to get as many blueberries as I would like the box would have to contain almost half blueberries and that is not just ridiculous, it would also be cost prohibitive.  I simply accept that as a fact.  I used Kefir instead of milk for the yogurt cultures I want and added a fresh peach.  This combination (even at the 3/4 cup recommended portion size) lasted me all morning.  I was impressed.  To begin with I had been slightly worried about the cinnamon flavor in the cereal because that isn't something I'm particularly fond of.  I need not have worried because I could not actually taste the cinnamon at all.  If you look forward to that taste, you will have  some objections to the company using that as a selling point for this product.  On another day I took a small zip closure bag of this cereal with me when I knew stopping for lunch would be a problem.  It was really good dry from the bag and kept me from giving in to the temptation to stop at a fast food restaurant.  Now that was a bonus.  I plan to order the six box package here on Amazon.  The price is virtually the same as in my grocery store chain, but my store has a monopoly in our area and they stock what they chose when they chose.  This is my way of spending MY money the way I want.

review/summary: Satisfaction Depends on Your Priorities
review/text: Nature's Path Organic Optimum cereal has an impeccable pedigree for the health conscious.<br />According to Nature's Path the cereal has "Certified Organic Goodness."<br />This means:<br />No synthetic pesticides<br />No synthetic herbicides<br />No artificial preservatives or additives<br />No genetically engineered seeds or ingredients<br />No irradiation<br /><br />Optimum is high fiber, low fat, and whole grain cereal with 25% less sugar than the previous recipe. The only sweetener listed in the ingredients is "organic evaporated cane juice."<br /><br />Fine. Optimum is probably a healthy breakfast choice and doesn't contain any of the nasties that the health conscious take pains to avoid. All of the cereals qualities and nutritional benefits are important to me too, but so is flavor.<br />After eating Optimum blueberry cinnamon cereal, I'm left to wonder why can't one have good taste and good nutrition in an organic cereal?<br /><br />My first taste of Optimum was straight out of the box. It didn't make much of an impression. The anticipated burst of cinnamon and blueberry flavors just weren't there. There's not improvement when the cereal is swimming in milk. The taste is bland and unimpressive. If one eats the blueberries individually, one can taste the blueberries though they are far from sweet. As far as cinnamon flavor goes, I detected none, not even a hint. It's also obvious that there's been a reduction in sugar content. I sprinkle sugar on this cereal, but it does little to improve the taste or eating enjoyment.<br /><br />Should you but this cereal? If health, nutrition, and organic content are priorities for you, but all means eat Optimum.<br />If you want the pizzazz of cinnamon or blueberry flavor, Optimum will seriously disappoint.

review/summary: Best cereal I've ever had, keeps you full!
review/text: This cereal is amazing!  I'm a cereal lover, and I find it hard to find truly healthy cereals (despite what packaging may boast), but this cereal *really* is healthy.  I expected it to have very few blueberries, but it's actually packed with them, and the fruit gives the cereal enough sweetness that I don't need to add artificial sweetener (which I love).  The blueberries, the hint of cinnamon, and the slight "maple" taste you get from the puffed wheat really do a lot for the flavor so you don't feel like you're really eating a healthy high-fiber cereal.  Since it is packed with fiber and protein, it keeps me feeling full for hours which cereal doesn't normally do!  Instead of being hungry an hour after I eat it, it actually holds me over from breakfast until lunch.  What I also love about this cereal is that the crunchy "sticks" stay crunchy until the last bite - the flakes do get soggy (as all flakes do by the bottom of the bowl), but the sticks stay crunchy the entire time.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to see this sold at Amazon, you can never count on local grocery stores to keep somewhat-"specialty" items in stock for long.  There's not a huge difference in the price here rather than at the local store, but at least I can buy it in bulk and not have to worry about finding a new cereal in a couple of weeks!

I get 3-4 servings per box, not too bad, breakfast for under a buck, this price is great with subscribe and save. I tried this after the granola sky rocketed in price and am so glad I did.

review/summary: My wife, a supertaster, detected no taste.
review/text: I was intrigued by the idea of combining cinnamon and blueberry. I was inclined to like the cereal, as those are both things I like quite a bit.<br /><br />I bought a box, brought it home. My wife happened to open it up first. She took a spoonful with some milk--and got that look on her face, and put her bowl and spoon down. "This is disgusting. It tastes like cardboard."<br /><br />You have to understand my wife is a supertaster--it's a real thing, look it up!--and so is supersensitive to flavors. She thinks plain Special K tastes quite sweet. She will happily eat simply a bowl of white rice for dinner.<br /><br />But in this cereal, she detected no flavors at all.<br /><br />Bizarrely, I thought "no, it couldn't be that bad. It's blueberry! And cinnamon! What could possibly go wrong?"<br /><br />The next morning I tried a bowl myself.<br /><br />It's disgusting. It tastes like cardboard.<br /><br />If there's cinnamon in it you could have fooled me. There are some little dried blueberries in it, but if you have anything but them in your spoonful, the blueberry flavor is overwhelmed by the styrofoam taste.<br /><br />Styrofoam plus cardboard plus half-sweetened sugar-smacks cereal. That is what this tastes like.<br /><br />I don't know what the people giving this positive reviews are smoking. Note that most of them even admit they prefer to add their own ingredients though...

review/summary: Make sure there are blueberries
review/text: I'm on my third box, and I have to say this cereal is amazing. It's crispy and delicious, and the texture variety is pleasing. Great cinnamon flavor and the blueberries, which I thought would be more a garnish than a flavor element, surprised me with their robust, fresh taste.<br /><br />Starting with the very first box, each day that began with a bowl of Optimum was a wonderful day. Great things started happening to me, too. Romance was rekindled between my ladyfriend and myself, and I even won a sizable amount of money from various lotteries. The universe kind of aligned itself in my favor, and I think it directly correlated with my consumption of this cereal.<br /><br />Then I hit the second box. While the first had tons of blueberries, and you got one in nearly every spoonful, there were exactly TWO blueberries in the second box. They were both in the first bowl. That was when things started going wrong, and all the great things that had been going on in my life started to crumble in front of me. My hours got cut at work, my car broke down, etc. It sounds silly, but I think whatever forces are behind this cereal's effects are directly related to the number of blueberries in each box.<br /><br />Box number three had lots on top though, so I'm crossing my fingers, and hoping things start looking up again. If you order this cereal, be sure to ask for the boxes with blueberries in them!

Enjoy !!!

review/summary: Fantastic Smell And Taste
review/text: My GF's mother sent me over a single K-Cup of Coffee People Coconut Mocha, because she thought I'd love it. And she was 100% correct! The smell is fantastic while it's brewing. The taste is absolutely satisfying. It's smooth -- not to strong, not to weak. It's a delicious rich flavor. I'm going ahead and buying a case....  NOW..

review/summary: Fantastic Belgian chocolates!
review/text: My mom first tried Leonidas chocolates when a co-worker brought her a sample from Belgium years ago. Later, during a family trip to Amsterdam in 2001, we stopped at one of their shops and bought several pounds of this fantastic chocolate for ourselves and family members.  10 years later, I ordered these as a Christmas present to my mom, knowing how much she loves these chocolates, and Leonidas, still does not disappoint. These were a total hit for the holidays and my mother, who does not eat dark chocolate, even gobbled up all of the dark chocolate pralines included in the holiday ballotin, they're that good! They are totally worth the expense.

review/text: These are the best cookies I have ever eaten! They are light, crispy, criunchy and very flavorful. They have just the right amount of spice and sugar on them not overpowering. I would not have know they were gluten free unless I read it on the package! These are my favorite of all of the Dr. Lucy cookies I have tried. I am a baker myself and believe that these cookies are well worth the money spent. So easy to grab and eat on the run.I wish they made bigger packages!

review/summary: Awesome and very different
review/text: I used this as a dipping sauce for wings, along with blue cheese.  The first thing I noticed is the very strong citrusy flavor which is from the fatalii peppers.  In the mix, there's a little smokiness, and you can distinctly taste fresh habaneros.  I'll be honest, at first I wasn't even sure if I liked the flavor on wings, but after using it a little while it grew on me and by the end of the pile of wings, I was really liking this hot sauce.<br /><br />This hot sauce is quite hot for a non-extract hot sauce.

review/summary: good and hot, no exract, a tad smokey and citrusy but not from India
review/text: This is good stuff. Ignore that this says its imported from India. CaJohns Fiery Foods is an Ohio company baby!  Its not blisteringly hot, but its actually edible and tasty not like that extract crap like Daves Insanity etc etc... Buy the 16oz jar if you can, its a far better deal. If you like basics like Melinda's XXX hot sauce this is at least two steps up. Bhut Jolokia has an inherent citrus/smoke flavor with heat that really builds. Not super hot at first, but give it a minute and it really starts to hit to kick in and trigger a diaphoretic response. Sweat as you may, you'll be happy you tried it. Great on basics like tortilla chips, enchilada, eggs, and pizza. Mmmm...

review/text: I first found this fruit spread in the Vermont Country Store last year.  It tastes like fresh fruit spread, not commercially processed.  There are small bits of fruit and peel and the flavor combination is not only healthy but delicious.  It blends wonderfully with plain Greek-style yogurt for a low-calorie treat that's better than most desserts!

"Don't waste your money again".<br />According to her report, the gift was mostly boxes, boxes within boxes, and little content.<br /><br />Getting accurate feedback from those who receive gift baskets and similar products is problematic--the recipient (unlike our friend!) is usually concerned about hurting the feelings of the giver when they are disappointed.

review/summary: I can't decide if the outhouse or my cozy toilet is the better place for this product.
review/text: After trying this for myself, I suspected that those high ratings were only illusions. My husband told me that company's consider these reviews as just another form of advertising and pay people to lie about a product's quality. I really can't imagine anyone thinking this product is drinkable, let alone, pleasurable. If you want a couple recommendations on decent tasting t-discs for your Tassimo machine, the Jacobs Latte Macchiato isn't bad if you add sugar. This morning though, I drank it after I tried the Voluptuoso and my mouth has a metallic taste to it. Not sure which one is responsible. Another thing, the milk in the disc tastes sour, but when you add sugar, there is a decent flavor there. For the 2nd decent beverage, you can take the Kenco Crema with some Coffee Mate's Spiced Pumpkin and Vanilla Spiced Chai (a liberal amount) creamers, with enough sugar, and have a nice smooth cappaccino. I've tried about nine flavors now, and the coffee, cremas, most lattes and cappaccinos, have the same inferior quality in looks and taste, as a cheap instant coffee, as well as, having your mouth taste like you just drank the contents of an ashtray. Kenco Crema is the only one that did not taste like nicotene. These are the coffees I've tried: Gevailia Cappaccino, Maxwell House - House Blend, Hag Crema Decaf, Jacobs Kronung, Carte Noire Voluptuoso Classic, Kenco Crema and Jacob's Macchiato. After finding one inferior brew after another, I've given up looking for a good cup of black coffee and/or cappaccino, for the Tassimo. Don't do what I did, which was believe all the positive reviews and downplay the critical reviews. My curiousity has been appeased after spending $34 in Tassimo beverages. Thankfully, 2 packages were free. Now I can either spend more money in S&H to return them, or drink all 56 cigarettes...coffee I mean. Oh by the way, for a tasty hot chocolate beverage, try Celestial Seasonings "Tuscanny" 1 bag made strong, followed by 2 pkgs Carnation Instant Hot Chocolate, with mini marshmellows, and hot water in a tall to-go insulated mug. Amazon sells both, but you can get the chocolate mix on sale for about $1.50 in a grocer.

Contadina adds WATER.  I didn't pay for water, I paid for tomatoes, hence the disapointment.

review/text: I thought of writing something witty and smart to take some of the sting out of my review, but there's not too much you can say that's good about this tea, other than the enticing aroma that comes up from the dry tea leaves; A nice blend of rooibos, chicory, and peach that enticed me to brew a cup. That was mistake #1; brewing it ruined the nice smell of the dry leaves, and the first sip was worse still; that was mistake #2. Holding on to it for so long hoping one day I would grow to love it was mistake #3.<br /><br />Finally, my girlfriend agreed to give it a try, and she loves it! Go figure! So I gave the box of stuff to her and now we're both happy!

review/text: This stuff is really, really good--maybe too good. It would be way too easy to pig-out and eat the whole pan full in one sitting. I tried several other brands I obtained locally. They weren't too bad--if you slathered enough butter on them to cover the taste. You don't need butter to make this brand eatable. I don't know how this product could improved upon even if one was cooking from scratch. It's easy too. Just add water and cook. You can even microwave it, although I haven't tried that. I would certainly recommend this mix to anyone who likes cornbread.

I thought the amount of six bags would be too much to store, since we eat a variety of breakfast items, but the bags are compact, and easy to store even sideways in a small space. The flavor is great, and a good base for adding any fruit and yogurt combination. You don't miss the oil, and there are enough almonds to feel like you have eaten something more filling.

What I don't understand is why they don't package one box as an assortment.  I am the only one who eats it.  By the time I finish 6 bags of Vanilla Almond I am really going to be tired of it.<br /><br />The granola is packaged in super-strong resealable plastic bags.  There's no danger of it all growing stale before I get to the last of it.<br /><br />Taste?  I love the taste.  Not too sweet.  Made without oils.  Lots of yummy things.  The almonds in this mix are really great.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who loves granola or wants to try it.  Just pick a flavor you think you'll really like.

review/text: I was hesitant to try this tea because I thought eggnog-flavored tea sounded like a weird combination, and I'm not even a big fan of eggnog by itself.  However, it turns out it doesn't really taste like eggnog anyway!  It has a mild nutty/vanilla flavor to it instead; it's very similar to the Celestial Seasonings "Nutcracker Sweet" flavor.  I like it, but probably not enough for it to displace my other favorite flavors.  (A person can only drink so much tea....  so many flavors, so little time....)

I had it plain and strong the first time I tried it; it was okay, and then I had second cup with milk and sugar, and it tasted better. Really light, and good for a cold winter's day. Plus, it doesn't have all the calories of eggnogg, so it's great for people like me who need to watch their weight.

review/text: Yesterday at church a young couple "shared" a box of Bigelow "Eggnoggn" tea bags with me.  She'd been given the tea while pregnant and it didn't sound "appealing" to her.  But as a tea fan...and an eggnog fan...I thought it sounded interesting.  Little did I know the delight that awaited me.  I added a spoon of sugar and some french vanilla flavored creamer.  I've never added cream to tea before, but there was a recommendation on the box to try it...so I did.  VOILA!!!  I now have a new favorite drink.  I loved it so much I came online looking for more.  I will keep this stocked in my house from now on as my go-to drink for a few minutes of peace, quiet and just plain enjoyment.  Thanks to whoever thought to try this combination.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!

review/summary: Eggnog Without the Calories!
review/text: This tea is fun and perfect for anyone who loves eggnog but doesn't want all the calories. I love the flavor of eggnog, but don't always want a thick creamy drink, so this is great for me.<br /><br />Though I do think it tastes (and smells) like eggnog, there's also something else there. I keep thinking Jelly Belly's buttered popcorn jelly beans? (edit: I hate those jelly beans, so I think I meant more of a buttery candy taste. Popcorn in a jelly bean? Should not happen!!)<br /><br />I love drinking this after dinner to calm my sugar cravings! Oh, but it goes well with chocolate, too.

review/summary: My favorite tea of all time
review/text: I host high teas fairly often and had four high teas between Christmas and the first week of the new year and this tea was the hit of them all (my tea menu usually has a dozen or more teas from which to choose), with people wanting several cups or even second pots of it.<br /><br />While other people feel it is better with sugar and/or milk, I actually love this tea plain, and there are very few teas which I like plain.  It's also been a hit with males and not just females.  I'm ordering six boxes from Amazon as our store is no longer carrying it (hope it's back next winter) and I think they'll also make great stocking stuffers next year.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: I ordered a single box from Amazon and just received it today.  I am sitting here drinking my first cup with no milk, cream or sugar.  I must agree with several other reviewers; it does not taste entirely like eggnog.  However, I am very much enjoying it.  It definitely has a "seasonal" taste that reminds me of the holiday season.  Also, I can definitely see where adding sugar and vanilla creamer would enhance the eggnog flavor.  I will definitely order this tea again, but peppermint herbal tea remains my favorite.<br />I have to knock off a star because it would be nice if there was a decaffeinated / herbal version.

review/summary: Seasonal Item, Hard to Find Elsewhere
review/text: After talking with a friend of mine who was quite sick at the time, the subject somehow turned to tea. She is a hot tea drinker and had finished off her box of Eggnogg'n tea quite a few months earlier. She said she was looking forward to getting some more around Christmas time, because that seems to be the only time she could find this particular flavor, which she says is wonderful. It does smell nice, but I prefer coffee, not tea. Anyway, I was so tickled to find this on Amazon, and at such a reasonable price. I had some shipped to her with a little get-well note and she was so excited, she had missed this so much. I normally wouldn't review something that I haven't personally had regularly (I did try this quite a while back, just a few sips, but I was waiting for the coffee to perk at her house:) The scent and flavor is surely similar to the spices found in egg nog, which I do like at Christmas time,  but this is a dark tea, and when I do drink tea (rarely) I like the green teas. Smelling it, though, almost makes me wish I did like dark teas, but I don't even like iced tea. This is one of those teas she likes to have from a favorite cup, and sit and enjoy, not so much a grab and gulp sort of thing. I haven't actively looked for this elsewhere since finding it on Amazon, but I understand it is mostly seasonal and hard to find elsewhere from her experience. I am so glad Amazon carries this, and at such a reasonable price.

review/summary: Not aptly named, but good.
review/text: Found this on clearance at the local supermarket, would not have bought it otherwise.  Eggnog tea?  It just sounds so weird.  Yes, it is, but also tasty.  There are eggnog like aspects to the flavor, and soy lecithin is their "eggy" flavor.  (Lecithin was originally found in egg yolks, but most lecithin these days is manufactured from soy sources.)<br /><br />Don't expect it to taste like eggnog.  Do expect it to taste pleasant.  Follow the directions - it is best when sweetened and has some milk in it.

review/summary: I love this tea.
review/text: First off, this review is extremely biased. Not because I work for Bigelow, but because I've been a consumer of Eggnogg'n for a few years now. And I looooveeee it. I can't say it tastes exactly like eggnog- especially the home made eggnog I make (trying to avoid the HFCS in the store-bought.) Maybe if you added a small amount of nutmeg to your concoction it could. But I see where they were trying to go with the taste. Regardless, it tastes amazing to me. I love eggnog, I love tea, and I especially love this :)<br /><br />A bit of soymilk and sugar and it's the final ingredient to not only a perfect cold winter day, but even a chilly summer night. Even a drop or two of vanilla extract helps out too. Mmm. If you have a couple spare dollars, definitely get a small box to give it a try. Whether an eggnog connoisseur like myself or not. Just talking about it so much, I'm going to make some right now!

review/summary: Nice, Lightly Spiced Tea
review/text: I was hesitant to try this at first because honestly eggnog (which I love) in tea form did not sound appealing!  My aunt kept telling us we HAD to try it, but we've been unable to find it in stores so far this year.  She liked it well enough to have me order a 6 pack here on Amazon, and even subscribe to having it delivered on a regular basis.  When it arrived, she shared some with us and I have to say it is quite delicious!  It does have somewhat an eggnog flavor, but to me it's almost more a mellow Chai flavor, lightly spiced, with vanilla.  Very good & something different, tea-wise.

review/summary: Bigelow  Egg Nog Tea Bags Box of 20 Tea bags
review/text: I picked up  2 boxes of  this Egg Nog tea  from a local grocery store not knowing anything about it<br />except that I like Egg Nog at  holiday time. The first cup got me hooked. I went back to buy<br /> more boxes, but  they were gone, and as this is a 'seasonal' tea, the store was not re-stocking.<br />I take my own tea bags  when we eat out and a waitress caught the odor and asked what kind of tea<br />that was. I gave some waitresses a bag to try at home, but said they were only available at Christmas.<br /> Too soon,I was opening  my  second box and knew thatI would definitely  run out, so I decided to write<br />to the company and see if they had any in the warehouse. I found that I could still buy the tea at Amazon<br />and ordered 2 cases, A friend , also a tea drinker, bought 2 boxes from me, and I gave a box to 2 of my<br />daughters. Thanks  to Bigelow for  making this delicious tea, and to Amazon for having it available<br />at a price I can afford.

review/summary: Yummy Flavor with Sugar & Milk - Nutmeg/Vanilla Highlights
review/text: I picked this up at our local grocery store.<br /><br />At first I thought this tea would be a little weird, but then decided that since I drink my tea with milk anyway, why not try it (it was on the seasonal discount rack).<br /><br />I'm glad I tried it.  This tea has a nice "yummy", semi-rich taste (with 2% milk & sugar) & is a good alternative to the other green/fruit/chai teas that I drink.  There are hints of nutmeg & vanilla that make this tea work.<br /><br />Recommended.  I will definitely buy this tea again.

review/text: I was disappointed that it barely has a faint eggnog flavor as it is more like a butter toffee flavor and fragrance. It is a pleasant mild tea that I brewed at the longest setting on my electric tea maker to obtain the strongest flavor without any bitterness. I will easily use up the 6 boxes by giving them away and using myself, but I will not reorder since I desired a true eggnog flavored tea.

review/text: I was looking for a product to replace Greenies for my three year old Chinese Crested. Although Bonnie never had any serious problems with Greenies I read about dogs choking on them and I know a few dogs even died. I realize dogs can choke on any product but I began to get very nervous.<br /><br />Flossies are great! Each Flossie lasts a lot longer than an individual Greenie did and they appear to be digested better by my<br />dog.  The crude protein in Greenies states "not less than 52 per cent" and in Flossies it states Crude Protein, minimum 89.73 per cent!" It is a low fat treat that my precious "baby" loves.<br /><br />By the way, in fairness to Greenies, they have come out with a wonderful "SMART BISCUIT" that is very digestible for dogs, as well as a treat called BARX, which is a very healthy soft snack stick.<br /><br />But Flossies will last your dog a long time and Bonnie guards her's ferociously!

review/text: I have been ordering these Merrick flossies for years now, they're made in the USA, not China, and keep my dog occupied for almost 30 min. So the price is usually worth it- nothing else keeps my dog occupied that long. BUT I was highly disappointed by this last shipment that I ordered last week. They are not only shorter, but much, MUCH thinner. My dog goes through one in half the time now. Also, each one of the 50 flossies are individually wrapped, super inconvenient having to open each and every one every time, not to mention the waste of plastic... Not sure what is going on with the Merrick brand. Otherwise, amazon is great in ordering & shipping.

review/text: I've been buying these treats for my 2 pugs for several years and they still go crazy everytime they see the box.  They are long lasting (for my pugs anyway), which is great because it keeps them "busy" while hopefully helping to clean their teeth.  Every evening they sit by the cabinet waiting for me to bring them out, and they happily chew away for an hour or so.  I especially like them because they are natural, and not loaded with lots of fat and fillers.  One note, if you have a smaller dog like my pugs, you may want to take away the flossie when it gets down to the last couple of inches as my dogs tend to just swallow it whole... make sure you keep the water bowl full with plenty of fresh water nearby.

review/summary: Merrick Flossies Dog Treats
review/text: Our Daisy dog loves these treats! I tried the cheaper ones but he knows the difference and won't chew anything but Merrick Flossies.  Our vet says our dog has the cleanest teeth he has ever seen because of the Flossies.  Love your dog?  Treat him/her with Merrick Flossies ... you are sure to get a smile in return!!

review/text: I have an adorable American Pitbull Terrier who is a FLOSSIE JUNKIE !!! He gets a small Flossie EVERY morning after his breakfast. It is the highlight of his meal and "we" make a big fuss about it. Believe it or not,he prefers the smaller Flossies over the Phats! I like that they are 100% tendon and a part of the body that he ( Spencer ) would consume in the wild. Because I do feed him raw, I like to keep his treats consistent with his diet. Merrick is RIGHT ON in that department. They rate above the charts in our household. Thank you Merrick for your awesome quality products.

review/summary: Bravo!! Order with confidence!
review/text: Merrick Flossies are awesome.  We have ordered them many time.  PetFoodDirect (via Amazon) really stands behind their service.  The first shipment was supposedly delivered by UPS but either wasn't or was stolen from my porch.  Another case was shipped pronto and with no questions asked.  My pups were desperate for their Flossies and the service was really appreciated.  Order with confidence!!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NV83EG">Merrick Flossies Dog Treats (50 Count)</a>

review/summary: Good but new recipe - just so you know.
review/text: My pups LOVED these flossies and I would buy them in cases of 50.  I would cut in half and give each shih tzu one and it would keep them busy for a while!  But, I recently ordered another case and they were "greasy" to the feel and look.  Turns out the manufacturer is now putting salmon oil on them (but has not put it in their description YET).  Just wanted you to know.  Sadly I now have to find another brand without the fish oil on them!  Some dogs may still love.  Mine did not.

review/summary: Flossies Rock!
review/text: My Cairn Terriers love their flossies more than life itself!  And my vet can testify how great they are for their teeth.  I just wish they weren't so expensive - how pricy can dried cow tendons be, really??

review/text: Love these!  Just wish they weren't so expensive.  Buying quantity did make them cheaper.  Dogs love them, and so do I.  They aren't messy, greasy, or gross like some other chews.

review/summary: My 2 dachshunds love the flossies
review/text: I have a small mini dachshund and a small standard dachshund.  I give them flossies 2 or 3 times per week.  They love the flavor and enjoy chewing it.  It also helps clean their teeth which is a plus. No by product and made in the U.S. so no worries about poor ingredients added.  When there is about 6 flossies left  I go and order another box.

review/summary: My dog loves these things....
review/text: The flossies arrived in perfect condition and a little quicker than expected considering I opted for the cheapest delivery option. These treats are one of the only ones I've found that keep my dog occupied for more than 5 minutes. She loves them so much in fact that she barely pays attention to anything else when she's gnawing on one. I only wish the treats would last longer. With my 25lb dog, I get about 30 minutes per flossie. All in all, this is a great product and at the lowest price I've seen anywhere.

review/summary: Best Chew on the market for small dogs
review/text: Small dogs love the Merrick Flossie.  It's spiral design makes it easy for them to hold it for chewing.  And, although it's sold as a treat, it does aid in oral hygiene, helping to keep your dog's teeth clean.

review/summary: Toss N' Treat Flossie
review/text: My dog loves his "Flossies". He tosses them in the air, rolls over on them, and loves chewing on them. So, it's like  an edible toy!! I will definitely keep them on hand.
