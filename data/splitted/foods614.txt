review/summary: Very poor quality
review/text: My husband and I love Cella's chocolate-covered cherries and I've ordered them many times from Amazon, but each time used a different seller. This batch is awful. The chocolate is melted not crisp, the bottoms of each piece looks as if a thumb has pushed them up and there doesn't appear to be any liquid center. Some of the pieces are sticky, too. I will never use this seller again. I wasted my money and that makes me angry.

review/summary: Molded Candy
review/text: Both boxes of candy, when opened, had a powder on the outside wrappers, the candies were dented and the liquid centers had solidified. This happened a year ago, of one of two boxes, from the same retailer, but I threw it away and did not think it would happen again. It appears that the powder is a type of mold and the candies were stored in an inadaquite storage area. I will not order from this vender again!

review/text: My dog loves this food.  I love it because her allergies have cleared up, I feel like I am feeding her something healthy, and her body is digesting most of it (don't have to clean up as much).  I looked at most natural foods but she is allergic to salmon, lamb and carrots.  That eliminated most of the options out there.  I was so glad to find this food.  I am not paying much more than I was when I was feeding her PetsMart's food and I am getting so much more.

review/text: If you don't live in or close to a metropolitan area, chances are you won't find taramosalata in your grocery store unless your town has a sizeable Greek population.  Krinos is one of the finest brands, and the shipping for the item is well within reason.  I had tried a store in Manhattan (I live 80 miles away) and the shipping was $30!!!

Such a great flavor, after tasting only a few for the first time I immediately orderd three more. These don't even have that "Almond" aftertaste, it finishes very nice with a hint of a butter maple flavor...wow.<br /><br />Now: To Diamond please rename to "Buttery French Toast", as this would be much better fitting.

review/summary: Unique product, well executed
review/text: The flavor of these nuts is similar to cinnamon toast cereal, yet they are filling and healthy, containing little sugar and almost no salt. I would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket, but Blue Diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy. Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...<br /><br />The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose. The ingredients:<br />ALMONDS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, BROWN SUGAR, CORN MALTODEXTRIN, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVORS AND SALT. PEANUT FREE. MAY CONTAIN OTHER TREE NUTS. Unless OTHER TREE NUTS comes from cows, I don't think this is true.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about "bowel tolerance" or "happy bowels" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

I will keep buying all their other flavors. The Bold line, especially the Habanero, is also excellent, as are the dark chocolate variety.

review/text: If you want a truly healthy, filling snack, you must give these a try, as well as their sisters, the Vanilla Bean Almonds. They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are "meaty" and sweet. And almonds are SOOO good for you. I'd recommend that you try them, and then get an Amazon subscribe and save if you can. It's well worth it! And all natural. LOVELY!

review/summary: Not the same as the canned version
review/text: I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond "Roasted Almonds - Honey" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very "off" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and "other natural flavors", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not "slivered" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned "Honey Roasted Almonds" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased.

review/text: This is basically candy masquerading as a "healthy" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack.

review/summary: Yummy in my Tummy :)
review/text: I ordered these lovely almonds a few weeks ago, as I often find myself jonesing for junk food, and I thought that if I had something that was good for me around, I would be less likely to grab something terrible.  These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.  I love these and I eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins :)

review/text: These are incredible!  Eating these makes me not want to eat candy.  I love these!  The price isn't that great though.  I think Blue Diamond should save money by packaging them in something cheaper than plastic.  I did notice it on Amazon in a box, but the price looks odd - over $50?  Too bad Amazon doesn't stock this, so no Free Shipping.

review/summary: Butter Toffee almonds are sooo good, but hi-carb
review/text: I've tried several of the Blue Diamond jar almonds and the Butter Toffee almonds are the best.  They would probably be my favorite almond, but they're high-carb. I guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time....  We can all do that, right?  :-)<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars -- my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt -- but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception.

review/summary: The best almonds on earth!!!
review/text: I must say, these almonds have made me a lover of nuts!!!  I have always been a cashew girl and never cared that much for almonds. Well, being on a low carb diet made cashews a no no.  Almonds roasted only with sea salt are soooo good. Blue Diamond makes the best tasting and these are hard to find in stores.  I love the 1 lb bag of these, but can't seem to find them. Buying these in bulk was the best deal out there and I will have to purchase again.  Thanks, Blue Diamond for a superior nut!

review/text: So the hottest-hot-off-the-press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away.... and for good reason.  They're full of B (and other) vitamins, fiber, --not-cholesterol, not-sodium, not-empty calories, and not tasteless wallpaper paste....<br /><br />But these --- these new Blue Diamond almonds (I've so far tried both the Brown Sugar Cinnamon and the Vanilla -- are soooooo good that it's hard to stop at an ounce.  This has become my after-dinner treat.<br /><br />To help fight the sodium bugaboo, they've instead coated them with a velvet dairy whey based powder (take note, lactose-intolerant folks) that is loaded with flavor.  They're not sweet -- except the sweetness of the lactose.  And they're not the least bit salty.  They taste like a great dessert in both flavor and texture.<br /><br />Thumbs way up -- licking my fingers kind of up.

review/summary: NOT as good as the ones in the tins
review/text: Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that "oven roasted" + "honey" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.

When we received the product, we found it labeled "specially selected for Wegman's." Sure enough, next time we went, there it was. In addition, two of the containers had an expiration in two weeks!

I knew it wouldnt be the same to have anise flavoring in my ice cream, and i was right! there is no substitute!  The package came quickly, and i am overall satisfied with the product.

review/summary: Oil is comparable to others - seller is lacking
review/text: I have used Lavender Essential Oil for years and loved the idea that these were food grade.  I ordered 7 different oils about a month ago - at the time of this purchase - but have only received 5.<br /><br />First the oils: They are mostly comparable to other brands but seem a thinner and do not seem to last as long as others - I expect that is due to the food grade. The bottles do not come with droppers - this makes it difficult to use as everything with essential oils is based on drops.  Depending on how often I actually use in food - I may or may not purchase this brand of lavender again.  The price is good but if I have to buy my own dropper tops it outweighs the better price.<br /><br />The company - faerie's finest - I was okay with the delay I was informed of on two of the oils in this purchase; however, when I recently emailed them to find out when those two oils would arrive I was informed that they were supposedly mailed before the date I was told there would be a delay.  When the issue is resolved - I will update this review.  In the interim, I will not recommend the seller nor will I buy from them again.  Which is unfortunate as they have nice selection of essential oils.

review/text: Hi,<br /> Online it says 100% pure lavender oil.  I use lavender oil religously and this does not smell like other pure lavender oils I've recieved in the past. The smell is faint and it is a little more 'perfume' smelling. I did notice on the bottle it says a 100% natural oil not a 100% pure lavender oil.  Online it states that it is a 100% pure lavender oil.  I wrote them and they wrote, "Thanks. We are sorry to hear that. Your can return for refund. But this is 100% Pure lavender oil, no mixed, no chemical.".. Too return it you would have to pay shipping back plus you are out the shipping you paid to recieve it too.  All in all if you are looking for a strong lavender smell this is not it. There responce was fast so I will give them the benifit of dout, so giving 3 stars for an okay rating. Thanks

review/text: I ordered this oil from "Enchanted Wilderness...Catey13" and am not sorry that I did!  I absolutely love lavender and when I finally recieved this oil, it smelled just as I imagined or better!  The concentration is strong and just a few drops go a really long way.  I've already used it in bath salts, a body scrub, a face moisturizer, linen spray and glycerin water and the bottle is still almost completely full.  Seems like this amount could last me for years!  I use the linen spray on my bed and it really makes the whole room smell wonderful and the bed seems "fresher" for a longer time between weekly washings.  The price was very reasonable and I even received a surprise sample of some rose geranium oil and some recipes and suggested uses with my order.  Also, the bottle does not have a dropper top, but there was a pipette included which works just fine.  Looking forward to trying it in lavender shortbread cookies next.  Would definitely order this again!

review/text: I know this is baby food, but I do like to know what my baby is eating.  So, I always taste test new baby foods before I feed it to her.  Now, there's some baby foods that are higher on the disgusting level of tasteless mush and others that are lower.<br /><br />This particular brand is actually quite good.  The flavors are fresh and fruity, and without the taste of anything too artificial (though there's still that citric acid tang).  I find that preservative "tang" taste to be pronounced in some baby foods I've tried, but it's not as bad here, particularly in the fruits.  I don't know why, but I appreciate it (even if my baby doesn't seem to notice).<br /><br />The Pears & Mangos is by far the tastiest, in my adult opinion, though my baby seems to enjoy the apple blueberry and apricots.  They definitely taste lower in sugar than some of the other baby foods we've tried, which is awesome too.<br /><br />She did not enjoy the winter squash, sweet potato, or any of the other vegetable/meat/grain combinations, including the banana oatmeal (and I have to concur with her opinion, I think citric acid was again used as a preservative and it added a rather unpleasant taste into those mixes).<br /><br />So, I say 5 stars to the fruit combinations (pretty easy to get baby to eat them), but would not recommend the vegetable/meat combinations (was actually easier to get baby to eat steamed vegetables ground up in my food processor).

review/summary: Great!  This is the easiest way to combine pears and mangos for baby food
review/text: Anything applesauce-based you can usually get a great deal in the store and combine fruit flavors yourself.  But pears and mangos take just enough extra work that I appreciated the ease of getting this one through Amazon.<br /><br />My twin 10-month olds turned out to be quite cooperative when it came time to eat this flavor brand!  Now I get it by subscription and they'd eat it instead of vegetables if they had a choice.  It is a consistency similar to applesauce, so you have to serve it in a similar way (it's runny).  I have the subscription to the Earth's Best Rice Cereal, so I always have plenty of that to mix in with it if I want.<br /><br />Ingredients per the label: Organic pears, organic mangos, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), citric acid.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 100% vitamin A, 45% vitamin C and 2% iron.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

review/summary: Best Baby Food, but not our favorite variety
review/text: Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />Pears and Mangos<br />So, I remember feeding this to my son and it taking some time to warm up to this flavor. Eventually he did like it, but it still was never his favorite. Now, my daughter has started trying new flavors and with a day of trying this broke out in a terrible rash and was sick to her stomach. Prior to this she had eaten Pears by themselves without any problems and so my conclusion is that she is allergic to Mangos. So, for the time being we are staying away from products with mangos in them, but may try this again in the future once she has had more exposure to other items.

review/text: I grew up eating poultry, beef and others meats with Sazon. My mom used it. It is really popular in NYC, especially the Bronx. I moved to the West Coast and cannot find it in stores out here so I am very happy I am able to order it online through Amazon - if not I would be really depressed. There is nothing like Sazon, it makes EVERYTHING taste fantastic! I use it on Chicken, Steak, Beef and Vegetables. When I'm getting low I become sad because without it everything tastes so bland. I like that this seasoning adapts to what you use it on so the flavor is delicious but the food doesn't taste the same. If you're a fan of rice and beans I highly recommended using this with Goya Sofrito and Recaito. You will make the BEST rice and beans ever. All you need is :<br /><br />2 packs Sazon<br />A can of Red Kidney Beans<br />1 half of chopped onion<br />2 tablespoons Recaito<br />2 tablespoons Sofrito<br /><br />Mix all ingredients in a sauce pan on medium heat for 10-15 minutes. Serve over steamed white rice and let the fireworks in your mouth begin.<br /><br />Much love!

If you want an easy way to fix mussels and clams, just add a packet or two of this seasoning to water in a large, wok-style pan.  The mussels and clams will open in the savory broth and you can serve them right from the pan.  Delicious!

review/summary: Sabroso!
review/text: As a first generation American, I tend to long for the Dominican dishes my mom used to cook.  To get the authentic flavor, Sazon Goya is without rival.  I used it in gandules, stewed meat, arroz con pollo and for my all American husband, chili con carne.

review/text: I lived in New Mexico for 15 years and grew to love the local cuisine, which means I am addicted to both red and green NM chile. Following the simple directions printed on the packaging, this seasoning mix hits the spot every time I need a fix of fresh carne adovada.

review/summary: Amazing customer service
review/text: When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert "3-4 mm" to inches and consequently discovered the "Coarse Grinder Salt" was almost 1/4" (1/6" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!

review/summary: Product changed....
review/text: This product seems to have replaced a similar previous product (Natural Himalayan Crystal Salt). The previous prodcut was a deeper pink color and the texture was better than what I was finding elsewhere. This new product (Himalayan Organic Natural Unprocessed Cooking Salt) is much more like what the competitors are selling. I've enjoyed all my products from The Spice Lab, but was disappointed with the replacent for this product.

review/summary: Great salt
review/text: This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a "rounded" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference.

review/summary: For more than salting foods.
review/text: Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet, and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron.

review/summary: Fluoride Content An Issue?
review/text: Not sure, but have been reading about Himalayan salt and apparently there is a high fluoride in this salt according to several reviews I've read, and that's not so good.  However, it looks very nice in my salt mill and tastes much better than Morton salt and I don't use it everyday.  Also, it's mined in Pakistan if that really matters.

review/summary: super fast shipping, free samples
review/text: placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping; super faster. the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me. in addition, it came with 3 samples (himalayan salt, lemon citron flake salt, and cyprus white flake salt) weighing quite a few grams each (sorry, doesn't say the weight and i don't have a scale with me at the moment).<br /><br />as far as product quality goes, i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods. i haven't tasted it yet, but i bet it tastes like salt. of course price wise this salt (the spice lab) is WAY cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods (even including shipping).

review/text: This is a great salt; it has a wholesome flavor and, I noticed it doesn't make you thirsty or rise the blood pressure as regular salt does. That's the benefit of the natural balance of minerals in it. I would recommend this to friends and health conscious people.

review/summary: Excellent Flavor
review/text: This is the first time I have used land mined salt.  I usually use salt from various sea sources.  After reading several reviews here on Amazon I decided to try this salt.  I was very pleasantly surprised the first time I tasted the salt. The flavor was fresh and subtle.  Not like the salt you usually buy in the grocery stores. Plus it has a lot of trace minerals your body needs.  I highly recommend this salt.

review/summary: the only salt I use--except herbamare and trocomare
review/text: I have not purchased this from Amazon yet as still on what I purchased elsewhere BUT I noticed many people buying the one pound bag. Just to let you know: one kilo equals 2.2 lbs. Why would you buy the one pound bag on something that never goes bad when you can get more than double for just a few dollars more.<br /><br />Dr. Mercola's comments regarding Himalaya salt benefits are what started me using this initially a few years ago. Many micronutrients, great purity. One person questioned the iodine: no salt naturally contains iodine unless it is iodized or contains some sort of seaweed. You can easily see his comments at mercola.com.<br /><br />Himalaya salt has a very 'clean' taste--add at the end of cooking.

review/text: I'll certainly be a repeat customer. I had a tough time finding large salt crystals to refill a grinder, but this fit the bill nicely.<br /><br />Flavor is clean with slight minerality. The color is not a deep as some other himalayan pink I've seen, but it's a very good finishing salt, and a good conversation piece when put on the table in a clear grinder.<br /><br />Also, the seller included a coupon for a future purchase in the package, which was a nice bonus.
