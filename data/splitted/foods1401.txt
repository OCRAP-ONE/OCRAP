review/summary: "Carry around a small stick"
review/text: These little sticks are in my opinion the "Best" Potato stick anywhere in the world! >Period&lt;<br />I cannot find them in the super market anymore, but I did find them on Amazon!<br />I have tried a number of other sticks from the market and honestly I end up pitching them...<br />French's are crispier and 100% tastier! And listen if you don't think so?! Purchase a box from Amazon!<br />You won't ever go back to any super market brand again! And now I'm going to order another case.<br />Because I'm out and after writing this I want some! :) So order a stick, you will be happy you did.

review/summary: Yummy Small Potato Sticks
review/text: I know these are Great. I ordered these (a box of 6-1 pound bags) on Feb 28. It is only March 17 and I have already eaten 3 of the bags. They taste great and are fun to eat. The only thing wrong is that they are NOT the Potato Sticks we ate as kids. These look like they took ripple chips and cut the chips along the ripple. They are very small sticks of chips or more like bits and pieces.

review/summary: Energy Enhancing and Oxygenating Water~
review/text: From Their Website:<br />"At the end of day, is water just water?<br /><br />You may think so, but not when it comes to Penta - Ultra-Purified Water.<br /><br />Founded in 1999 in San Diego, California, we created the Penta Water Company, Inc. with a mission to make a refreshing difference in the purity of water, and thus, in the quality of life. It inspired us to become like fine wine connoisseurs, where we could taste, discern, and feel the difference that Penta awakened in us. When we introduced it to the world, it was love at first sip and the rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />Today, PENTA water is available in more than 3,500 stores nationwide and the love for it continues to grow with many more stores being added monthly. Penta is also sold internationally, including in Australia, Canada, and Japan.<br /><br />Unlike many supplements and beverages that use synthetic additives, Penta has no additives so it is naturally and fully absorbed by your body to maximize its antioxidant effects. Oh, and did we also mention that our water is proven be the purest around? After all, not all waters are created equal.<br /><br />So you see, at the end of your day, at the beginning of your day, and in the middle of your day, the type of beverage and the kind of water you drink really matters.<br /><br />Penta is for the nourishment of your mind, body, and soul. It goes beyond hydration to become a way of life, a choice to fully embrace a vital, healthful life...today and tomorrow.<br /><br />Zero Additives. Ultra-purified Water. Now that's refreshing!<br /><br />PENTA, Live PURE."<br /><br />***I've personally been enjoying the amazing Penta Water since it became available to me locally in 1999. It absolutely re-hydrates me, leaving me feeling energized, refreshed and renewed. I drink Penta everyday with my dietary supplements (It's especially effective with a 5-Hour Energy Shot). Thanks Amazon, for these excellent prices too.***

review/text: BBQ and pasta. That should have stopped me right there but it didn't. It did stop me from fixing it for a while but I eventually took the plunge.<br /><br />It is just not very good at all. Maybe if you've never had BBQ or good BBQ this might be passable but otherwise just think it over - pasta with BBQ sauce - and let that be your guide.<br /><br />For completeness, what really struck me wrong about it was the texture with the flavor. It was odd to say the least. Not inedible but weird in a bad way.<br /><br />If you like BBQ sauce and you are a big pasta fan then this probably is worth a try. Everyone else should avoid it.

review/summary: Easy, One Skillet, 40 Minutes - Tastes Great
review/text: I grew up in Wisconsin, liking Velveeta, a processed cheese made from the leftovers of better cheddars and other cheeses. This was considered a sin by my uncle, a cheese broker in Manitowoc. Nevertheless, we ate a lot of it, because it was cheap. Now (sixty years later) I can afford Wisconsin's finest cheddars; but this product seemed worth a try.<br /><br />You need nothing but the package and a pound of skinless chicken breasts. Forty-five minutes is required start to finish; but there is little to do for 50% of this time.<br /><br />The package has a pasta bag (just fine), a barbeque sauce bag, a vegetable bag (tiny and not attractive), and a cheese sauce bag. The taste was just fine; but I will substitute some frozen stir-fry veggies next time.

review/summary: Dog Loves
review/text: I bought this to let my dog try it out when we switched over to adult food.  It is extremely expensive, but when I fed my dog this food, I put it at the bottom of the bowl and put her old food over the top of it. She proceeded in digging through the old food to and only eating this food. She LOVES it. When we made the switch she had some really bad gas, but that only lasted 2 weeks and now everything is normal, and instead of waiting to eat her food, she pretty much eats it right when I put it in her bowl. I highly recommend this food. The only thing I wish is that the food pieces were bigger so she would have to chew it up. I was at the vet and he said that there prescription science diet is made with carrot fiber so as the dogs are chewing it up (big pieces that can't be swallowed hole) it is also cleaning their teeth... So We will see if her teeth get bad in the long run, I constantly give her small chunks of raw hide and teeth cleaning toys, so I am hoping that will also fend off bad teeth.  My dog loves this food. Highly Recommend!

review/text: I have been making the food for my little Maltese since the pet food scares a few years ago.  I use Halo dry food for little treats for him and if I run out of the home-made and can't get a batch done before his next meal.  I trust Halo products, they're made of real food items, just like the food I make.  I tried the salmon first and Charly loved it, but I didn't like the smell of it much.  Once that was gone, I gave the chicken a try.  He loves that also and it doesn't have the same smell, so I like it better.

review/summary: My precious child (yorkie) REFUSED to eat for 2 months!!!!!
review/text: I have literally been frantic over "Celli" (nickname for Andrea Bocelli) not eating anything except treats..no nutritive value..for 2 months!!! I cooked grilled chicken breasts, beef cooked every way, even lean pork chops...no deal...It is very grueling to watch your only baby starving!!! I tried 32 flavors of dog food. He has always preferred dry food over canned food. So I was perusing the dog food offered by my "hero sight" Amazon,and something about Halo Spots Stew caught my attention. For days I went back and forth between flavors that my pooch would find appealing. Finally, I settled on the adult lamb recipe. After ordering I thought "Oh no, the kibble is going to be too large for his small mouth"( Am I neurotic, doting mother or what?) Anyone who thinks I am totally disgusting doesn't know what this situation is like!! I was prepared to chop the dog food in my food processor...BUT, the food arrived quickly, as usual for Amazon, and what a surprise!!! Upon opening the bag of food, to my pleasant surprise, the smell of the food was so good..so fresh.. and the kibble is so small!! Now for the happy ending...Celli ate every bit in his bowl as if to say "This is what I've been waiting for"...Mommy will rest tonight...Thanks Halo and Amazon...My love and gratitude to you!!!

review/text: Finally!-- a dry dogfood that my dog likes. I've tried many of the better quality dry dogfoods, but I usually give away at least half the bag to another dog owner. I've bought 3 different flavors of Halo Spot's Stew, and she likes all of them. And maybe it helps that the food is made in smaller pieces. I often mix the dry food with chopped meat or hard boiled egg, and sometimes wet dogfood. She eats everything instead of picking through it and leaving behind some of the dry food. Also, the size of the bag is easy to handle.

Her dog, Mr. Quiggs gives it "two paws up."  Full of real food and the end result is easy to scoop - hey, that rhymes with poop!  Cowboy will pick out the peas (yes, there are real peas in there) and eat the rest of the food first - either he saves the best for last or he really doesn't like peas.  I'm guessing the latter.  It's a big plus that the food can be delivered to my door - thanks Amazon.

review/text: My dog loved this food, and he lost a few pounds without seeming to be ravenous all the time.  I'm so impressed with the high quality ingredients, but I'm still searching.  My dog's skin issues are much improved on this food but not completely resolved, and peas are unusually high on the ingredient list here, so I'm thinking that he may be allergic to peas as well as corn.  Would definitely buy again if I can rule out peas as a problem.

review/summary: 15 years of Shedding Stops!
review/text: My JRT used to shed terribly before I found this brand.<br />I have tried at least 20 different premium dog foods, supplements, & coat treatments throughout her 16 years.  No expense was too great.  Her coat always looked shiny and healthy, but no amount of brushing (I tried all types of grooming tools, even those wire things to strip a dogs undercoat) would  even slow down her shedding.  And, she is also a very picky eater, demanding a new brand after about a month.  All that shopped with HALO.<br /><br />--It was AMAZING!  After a few weeks her shedding was noticeably decreased!  Thinking it was a dream and I had finally gone off the deep end I pushed it out of my mind.  I didn't want to jinx it but I washed and vacuumed the car especially well, crossing my fingers that it wouldn't fill up with hair. Sure enough, by the time she finished her first 4 pound bag of Halo Stew she STOPPED shedding altogether! AND, she has been eating this brand for months and still loves it!  Another prayer answered!

The Bigelow k-cups are terrific, much better than the other mint tea k-cups I've purchased in the past (Gloria's and Celestial Seasonings) in offering a bright and brisk cup of tea.  But please note: these might be a bit too vibrant for those with a more subtle palette.

review/summary: My favorite tea
review/text: I've loved this flavor of tea in the regular tea bags for a long time so naturally when I got a Keurig I had to find out if they made K-Cups. I am so happy to say that they do. It comes out perfect when I use my machine on the 10oz setting. It's very refreshing and what I especially love about it is the hint of spearmint. The mint flavor in my opinion is just right- not too overpowering, but not weak. It makes great iced tea in the summer as well. Love this stuff! A++ in my book!

review/summary: Could be better- very strong tea!
review/text: I like to drink herbal tea every once in a while as a break from coffee.  I love Mint Medley tea bags, but it doesn't work so well in k-cup form.  It seems to come out very strong, so I add more hot water in (which kind of defeats the pupose)!  My Keuring brewer can only make an 8 oz. cup.  If your brewer can make a 10 or 12 oz. mug, this tea would probably be worth a try.  I'm sure personal taste preference is also a factor here.

review/text: I don't know what makes this stuff so much better than the plain Dagoba cocoa (or even my favorite Ghirardelli cocoa powder), but it is. It's unsweetened, which means it can be added to smoothies or yogurt or anything you like and sweetened with fruit or your favorite healthy sweetener. It is rich and delicious, and the occasional cocoa nib just makes it even better. I hope they never discontinue this stuff! There's a review here complaining about the cost, but that's shipping costs. It's always much cheaper if you can buy it locally or buy it in bulk. Some of the vendors here sell it in bulk and I highly recommend it - worth having always on hand!

Which is one reason I chose this package size as I will be using them fast enough to keep them at the peak of their flavor. I've found that for me, the larger quantities tend to go a little flat toward the end, but this 7oz size in a multipack of 6, each with the freshness sealed in should go a long way to keeping my sourdough rye tasting as good as it can. If this works out, I will be ordering this again and again.

In the Olympia area, the cartons can also be recycled; check to see if they can in your area.<br /><br />These little cartons have earned a permanent spot in my pantry, in fact I've signed up for Amazon's subscriber service where they will automatically send out a box of them at an interval I chose.

review/summary: The perfect lunch box companion!
review/text: I have been ordering Organic Valley White Lowfat Milk from Amazon for over a year now and they have become a staple on our pantry shelf.  They provide a very convenient way to give my kids a healthy, organic beverage in their lunches or on the go.  I even take them to work with me!  I really like the taste - this milk is slightly creamier than regular milk and my kids love it because to them it is like a "milkshake".<br /><br />What I really love is the fact that it is organic and hormone free - something I am paying more attention to lately and looking for when buying dairy and meat products. Organic Valley is a company that cares about it's farmers, animals and it's consumers.  Their products do not contain pesticides, non-natural fertilizers, synthetic growth or breeding hormones, antibiotics or GMO's (genetically modified organisms). They care about their animals and the land that they graze.  When you purchase their products, you can feel good about what you are serving your family and you are supporting farmers who care as well.<br /><br />Amazon.com sells this product at a great price (lower than at my local natural food stores and even large chain stores).  I save even more by ordering this through Subscribe and Save - I save an additional 15% AND have the milk delivered to my door every month (you can have it delivered every 1,2,3,or 6 months and if you run out and need more you can have it sent on demand!)  If you are a busy parent, this is an incredible convenience and I highly recommend ordering this and other commonly used items through Amazon's Subscribe and Save!

Sadly, Amazon doesn't seem to offer exchanges on this stuff, but the rest are going in the trash.<br /><br />I imagine that not all of them are like this, since other people seem to have enjoyed their milk. Mine has the following on the label: 28 Jan 11 A32 27-421 17:32 0069615.<br /><br />Update: I contacted Amazon and they were able to refund my money for the spoiled milk.

review/summary: Convenient, but with an very strange taste
review/text: I've purchased Organic Valley's milk for quite some time now, always in the form of half-gallon containers, which taste perfectly fine. So this time I decided to try out the aseptic cartons. the plan was to keep these on hand for when i run out of milk during the week.<br /><br />When drinking it by itself, it seems to have an off taste. Can't quite describe it in words. Just a strange taste that doesn't stay in your mouth, but its hard to ignore while drinking it.<br />I've also tried it with my coffee, and luckily the coffee successfully masks the weird taste.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: We bought this for daytrips, skiing, and road-trips and lunches because we can freeze it but dont have to reallyt worry about having it in the refridgerator.  The taste is pretty good but the convenience is awsome. It is much more affordable if you get it with the free shipping.

review/summary: I love this milk!
review/text: I really miss being able to get milk in shelf stable packs. It was so convenient to get Parmalat milk in other countries and occasionally here, but I haven't seen it in years. I love these! GOT to have milk in my coffee every morning, and am often too lazy to dash to the store at night if I run out. These are great for travel, camping, work. Coffee is a big deal for me, and if I'm going somewhere that I think there is a chance that powdered creamer is the only option (getting an oil change, a waiting room, hotel room, etc) then one of these is perfect tucked in my purse. I love the taste, and love the fact that it is ORGANIC!!!

review/summary: More convenient than tasty
review/text: These do have a slight off taste to them, presumably due to the pasteurization. They are, however, very convenient for someone who is busy (healthier than most anything else you can bring to drink at lunch.) They do also have the benefit of pretty much not going bad, which can be a going concern when you live on your own and have trouble finishing a fresh gallon before it goes sour.

review/summary: Great milk product !
review/text: These little milk cartons are fabulous and an excellent solution for single serve size.  The aseptic packaging allows this product to be shipped and stored without refrigeration (keep cold after opening though; of course).  You pay a bit of a premium for organic milk and individual packaging; but if you drink milk and have a need for single serve, it is money wisely spent to avoid the long list of toxins from the mega-corporate milk.  This product is difficult to find in local stores; so it is nice to see Amazon carrying this product.  The taste is excellent too.  Nice job by Organic Valley and Amazon.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/01/2011<br /><br />As of today's update, Amazon is not longer selling this milk product.  Sadly, an Amazon merchant is instead selling it, at a significantly higher cost than Amazon was selling it at.

review/summary: good milk, convenient
review/text: After trying the OV chocolate milk, I decided to give the plain 1% milk a try.  It is creamier than I am used to with most milk and has a bit of a sweet taste, but is very good.  I like that I can take these to work and keep one in the fridge and not take up lots of space (we have one fridge for over 50 people!) while the rest can wait at my desk.  They are also nice to have in a pinch when I run out of my full gallon of milk and am cooking and need a cup or less of milk.<br /><br />I'm happy to support Organic Valley not only because it is organic, but because my friend's parents own one of the dairy farms in the co-op.  I am not just supporting family-owned farms, but also one that I know.<br /><br />The expiration date was months in the future on the ones that I received and they were easily all gone by the time the date arrived.

Really like that they don't have to be refrigerated until they are opened. Like the taste of this milk better than the other organic carton milks. The subscribe & save price on these makes them a good price that's hard to beat anywhere else.

review/text: While in Germany in the 80's I bought milk similiar to this, but it had a much longer shelf life, these expire in June 2012.I agree with many other's who stated that the milk did not taste all that good. What really drove me to find this order was something else though, the straws are way too short. I pushed in too hard I guess & whoops in goes the straw.I will not order these again.I only went to them tonight because I was out of milk and I like drinking milk with my chilli. I guess that I will go out and buy some tomorrow when I eat the left overs. I bought the chocolate too, I hope it tastes better than the white.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: This milk really tastes good. Even though it is 1% milk, it's flavor is much the same as full fat. Even my husband said he thought it looked like full fat milk, when I was pouring it. I originally bought this milk to use only when I run out of regular milk, or just so I would have milk when I need it for cooking, or whatever, instead of having a quart or half gallon go sour on me. I usually don't use this much milk, but I am back to buy more. It's only been a week, and I only have four 8 ounce cartons left. I originally chose this one, because I believe I am learning that if it's organic, it's probably going to taste pretty good.

review/summary: Wish they made it 2% not 1% milk
review/text: My son LOVES..LOVES Organic Valley fresh milk. Of all the organic milk we bought for him, he drank up the Organic Valley brand the fast. We found that if we bought OV brand, that week he would consume additional half gallon of milk compared to all the other organic brand milk. Even though we purchased 2% fat milk the majority of the time, I was not hesitate to order this at Amazon.com since it's only 1% difference. Boy... was I wrong!!! My son would not drink this milk at all, he had one sip and that was it!!! I want to pack this in his lunch bag, but since he's not liking it at all, I've had this all carton of milk not touched over 2 months. I did also purchase OV's chocolate milk, my son loves it. But chocolate milk has double amount of sugar in it compared to white milk, I don't want him to get hooked on it.
