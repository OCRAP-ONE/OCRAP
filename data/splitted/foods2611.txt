review/summary: Burton's Digestives Sweetmeal Biscuits
review/text: These biscuits go nicely with tea, coffee and ice cold milk. Nice texture, slightly crumbly, barely sweet, which I love, so don't expect the sometimes cloyingly sweet American cookie here. They're fibrous for those that require it. Nice buttery undertones but no greasy feel in mouth or on fingers. Makes for a nice break in mid afternoon. They freeze very well, too, so don't hesitate to buy larger amounts when on sale. To my taste they're almost as flavorful as McVitie's at greatly reduced cost. I'll buy whenever I see them on sale.

review/summary: Power Puff for Digestive Health Leads the Pack!
review/text: Searching for a low-sugar wheat-free puff to offer my baby girls, I discovered Plum Organics with much joy. Clearly superior to all other major brands of baby puffs for digestive health, who's better than Plum for my family? I've successfully battled to contain a serious digestive disorder called Ulcerative Colitis for over a decade in part by special attention to diet. In that time I've learned even moderate amounts of wheat causes problems by creating an overgrowth of Candida yeast in my system. Some know this as a sensitivity to gluten or sugars, others suffer without realizing as so many foods contain wheat or high amounts of sugar. For me it's cumulative folks, a little in nearly everything really piles up. I notice my body getting too much as soon as I begin to heavily crave breads or sugars.  Before you know it, that gummy gluten renders me 90% incapable of absorbing nutrition altogether.<br /><br />Back to the Puffs... wheat is high in gluten, but the oat and rice based Puff offered by Plum Organics stands out with ingredients more gentle on digestive function. This is in addition to providing all the stuff HappyBaby remains conscious of, like sugar and vitamin content. Rice is gluten-free and minimally processed oat may be too, but many still leave it off the list of gluten-free foods due to typical cross-contamination issues with lots of wheat growing and processed alongside oats. Small amounts are ok with me anyway -- I'm looking for regulation rather than elimination here. So I'm happy to introduce all these foods to my daughters at healthy levels.<br /><br />How about the sugar content? Super low, and only natural organic fruit, vegetable or cane juice is used (not corn-syrup as another reviewer erroneously reported -- [...]). And can we really get upset about a little blueberry or sweet potato juice temporarily staining a cloth when you account for their health properties? Regulate, read the labels for yourself and take joy in offering your kids a simple, low sugar, high vitamin, low gluten snack.<br /><br />Oh and must say, I love that they're mainly just puffed air with a fantastic balance of nutrients. 1/2 cup or about 75 pieces per serving keeps my little dears engaged in motor development and feeding skills for a while without concern for dietary imbalance.<br /><br />Bunch of facts, all packed up to help someone out there enjoy a little extra peace next time they offer Plum Puffs to their kids.  Live well!

review/summary: Finally, puffs that are organic with a flavor!
review/text: I have tried other puffs before. I tried a Gerber mixed type and another organic brand that should have been called, "bland", they have no flavor!<br /><br />My mother bought these for my daughter and put them in her diaper bag when I took her out to dinner with her father. I put some out for her and she gobbled them up. I then decided to taste them myself, I was starving and the food was taking forever, they were good! I came home that night and immediately ordered these. I can now have two canisters here and leave two canisters at grandmas.<br /><br />As far as staining, I did not have that issue. I am also a clean freak and worried about that the babies need to be babies. My daughter is 13 months and even if she drops some of these I have not had any staining.<br /><br />These are by far the best puffs I have bought and tasted. She seems to enjoy them and I monitor how much I give her since they do have sugar. These are a winner in not only my household but at the grandparents as well.

review/text: Although my daughter enjoys eating these, I'm not a fan of the blue/purple powder that coats the cereal.  The powder turns baby drool black leaving dark spots on clothing and bib.  And it gets all over hands.  I prefer other brands where the flavor/color is already baked into the cereal rather than as an exterior powder.

review/summary: I would give these five stars, but for teh blue mess they make
review/text: They do taste great, however, they turn fabric blue (the lining of the bibs, my baby's clothes, etc.)  While this isn't too big of a deal when at home (feed her naked in a plastic highchair), it makes for a big pain when we are traveling, which is what I buy the puffs for - convenience during travel.  I am not sure there is anything the company can do; blueberries are, after all, blue.  I'll keep what I still have for myself (I told you they taste great!), but will not be ordering anymore of this particular flavor in the future.

review/summary: Doesn't taste good, weird after-taste
review/text: I bought this last night at a local store because they are on sale. I have been longing to try the organic one for the sake of my baby's health. But this tastes so weird, almost like the cough syrup. The taste on each puff are not made evenly, I believe that is how they manufacture the puff, dry the puff out and spray the flavor & color onto each puff and package. And they dont melt as easily as the Non-organic one. I am not impressed. Would return the unopened ones to the store.

review/summary: Leaves baby with blue hands, face, & clothes
review/text: I love the Plum Organics baby food, and I was thrilled to see they had organic puffs for my little one. They are the right size, they stay fresh longer than other organic puffs we have tried, and they taste great! However, they will stain your baby BLUE! I was so disappointed that these puffs are sprinkled with organic blueberry powder and when mixed with baby slobber, your baby, highchair, and clothes will be blue. I am not sure why such a great product would have such a poor design. With a baby the last thing you want is a product that contributes to the mess and stains. I will not be buying more of these as I have seen the other flavors and all are colored, so I assume they will stain as well. This is one very disappointed Momma!

review/summary: Puffs the super snack
review/text: Plum puffs have a little bit more flavor to them then say a HappyBaby puff, they also have more color (from the food flavoring the puff).  So these purple ones can sometimes dye a sticky, wet finger, or sweaty hand.  Be mindful of that if you have a white carpet or say are the type of parent who is kind enough to let your child eat on the couch with the delusion that they won't crush and grind it into the surface.  Just saying.  They taste good for puffed up pieces of grain, it's a fun portable finger food, the containers make for easy storage.

review/summary: Yummy Puffs
review/text: My 10 month old daughter absolutely loves these things.  I originally bought the gerber puffs and she liked those as well but we use the Plum Organics baby food so I really wanted to stick with the organic stuff so I switched to these.  The blueberry and purple sweet potato  is one of her favorites and she can sit in her high chair and feed herself these with ease.  They are also great on the go.  If she gets a little fussy in the car or while in her stroller these are great to keep her calm.  I also really loved how they come in a 4 pack.  It is really convenient not having to go to the store when one container of puffs is gone.  Also the price is great!  This 4 pack came out to be cheaper than they are at my local grocery store.  Would definitely recommend these for your little one.  I also bought the strawberry and beet flavor and she loves these as well.

review/summary: Very crunchy, sweeter than HappyBaby brand
review/text: I like that these come in different "colors" to make things more interesting for babies. They are crunchier than the HappyBaby brand, which I like. They are a little sweeter too, which could be good or bad depending on your baby's (or your) taste.  One downside is that the purple color "dusting" does rub off on wet/sticky fingers and can temporarily stain clothes/furniture.

review/text: I had high hopes for these - organic! sweet potato! cute safe finger food! But when I saw the mess they made, I just couldn't love them. Not only do they leave purple slobbery stains on everything they touch, the puffs also quickly dissolve into gooey lumps that stick to clothes, skin, hair. My daughter seems to like Cheerios and Chex just as much as these and they leave far less mess. She's almost 7 months and if she's good with more "grown up" foods, I'm happy to leave mushy baby foods behind.

review/summary: Finally...I am in love!
review/text: I have never written a review before, but I am so enamored by this product I wanted to share my experience. I have two cats, and litter tracking has been a problem for years.  For health and dust issues I stopped using clay litters a long time ago, but have tried everything else.  Any of the crystal litters were hard on my cats paws and not scoopable.  I love the pine litter, but tracking was a major problem.  We have a covered litter box with an internal ramp.  When they came out of it, they step onto a litter mat that was grated and captured litter in a tray below.  They then walk across a fleece mat to capture more.  And finally, they move through a kitty door (a nice sized hole in the closet door - the litter box is housed in the office closet) where there was another blanket.  We did as much as we could, short of personally washing their paws each time they exited the litter.  It didn't matter.  Within hours after daily cleaning and vacuuming the floor would be a mess again.  We had litter everywhere, even beyond the room the box was located in.  It became a joke - a frustrating one.  We love our animals, but the litter was a huge problem.  About a month ago I came across the Green Tea Litter, and tried it.  AMAZING.  Happiness, bliss and wonderment hit immediately.  It is comfortable for the cats paws, easy to scoop, better at covering the smell, and DOES NOT MAKE A MESS!  The daily cleaning ritual of the floors has ceased.  It took years for me to find this solution, I hope to save you some of that time by writing this review.

review/summary: High hopes dashed
review/text: On the seemingly endless search for a better alternative to traditional clay litters, I had high hopes for Green Tea Leaves Cat Litter due to the number of positive reviews regarding the product.  Upon opening the bag I found the litter had a pleasant woodsy-tea odor that was not overpowering. The pellets (they can't be called in any way, shape, or form granules) are lightweight and of a comparable size/consistancy to Yesterday's News cat litter (or rabbit food pellets). Upon pouring the litter into the pan, waves of dust bourgened from the box.  Although the manufacturer describes the product as "low in dust", it is anything but.  In fact it's worse than many clay litters. The dust didn't end after the initial pouring either; every time the litter box was scooped, the waves of dust made a reappearance. My poor kitties must have a hard time breathing everytime they dig in this litter, and it's probably one reason why they dislike it so much.  The other likely being the consistancy. The litter does clump well, and the odor control is good, however trying to put myself in the cat's paws I had to pose the question; would I rather walk on a sandy beach, or a rocky one?  The answer is obvious; sand, of course. Hence, it's not a big surprise to find that the cats really do not like this product. There is also alot of tracking of the pellets outside the box due to their light weight and size.  In summation:<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - pleasantly mild woodsy-tea odor<br /> - clumps well<br /> - lightweight<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - hard pellet-sized litter that annoys felines to the point they avoid the box<br /> - high dust<br /> - high tracking<br /><br />If the manufacturer ever makes the pellets into smaller sand-like granules I'd be up for revisiting the product, but for now the cons far outweigh the pros for my household.  Unfortunately, we have to give the product one thumb and two paws down.

review/summary: I've tried everything, and this is the best
review/text: You name it, I've tried it.... clay, corn, wheat, silica, pine, newspaper, cedar, various combinations of the above, and multiple brands of several varieties ... none of them worked as well as the green tea litter.  It's the best odor control I've found.  It doesn't stick to my long-haired cats butts and create a clumpy mess that has to be clipped out of their pantalones (a major issue with long-haired cats and clumping litter).  It eradicates the litter box smell better than anything else I've found.  It doesn't have a strong or chemical smell.  To top it off, the cats prefer it to anything else I've tried and all adapted to it immediately.  It also tracks less than the other options.<br /><br />The only issues I've had are:  1. It's a pain in the neck to order it and then wait for a week for it to show up; 2. Because of the larger chunk size I had to find a scoop with larger holes than average and that was a bit of a pain; and 3. The chunk size is too big to work with the littermaid I own.... the thick plastic tines just acted like a shovel, instead of a scoop -- and it's just too expensive to be throwing clean litter out when it's still good like that.<br /><br />Green tea litter vs. keep using the LitterMaid?....  the green tea litter won and the LitterMaid has been retired.... yeah, the green tea litter is better at lowering litterbox hassle than the self-scooper.<br /><br />If the chunk size was small enough to work well with the littermaid, this would be 5 stars.<br /><br />I did just order an OmegaPaw rolling litterbox to try with it -- hopefully that will work out and make cleaning the box easier -- with 8 cats I need all the help I can get.<br /><br />Update......<br /><br />It's too chunky for the "roll n clean" grid.... it WILL go through, but instead of slowly roll it one way, then roll it back, pull out the tray and dump it, then roll back further to put the clean litter back.... it's slowly roll it forward to tilting toward the end..... spend a couple of minutes shaking the heck out of it to get the non-clumped litter through the grid, finish rolling it and then roll it back, dump the drawer and then roll it back the other way and shake the heck out of it again to get the clean litter back in the other direction.....  a workout which pretty much takes the ease of use of the "roll n clean" away.  I'm contemplating modifying the roll n clean and then retrying with larger slots to see if that works.  Decided to try a LitterMaid Ultra Mega because of the wire tines in the rake and the larger gaps between and it still raked way too much clean litter -- acting more like a shovel than a rake.  At this point I'm back to testing litter/box combos looking for a solution.... with 8 cats and a bad back, the notion of scooping by hand several times a day is not a good one.

It clumped well, but tracked everywhere because it was so light, and also would get all over my kittens fur, not cool. The smell is the worst part though,The memory of it still makes me cringe when I think about it.<br />*Good mews recycled paper smelled horrible out of the bag, was heavy, looked gross in the box, and was not flush-able.

review/summary: Closest thing to perfect I've found
review/text: I won't say we've tried every cat litter there is, but we've sure gone through a lot. We finally settled on a popular clay/crystals blend that worked pretty well, and were using a Litter Locker for disposing of the clumps and feces. Nothing like a plastic container full of used kitty litter to really glam up your bathroom, eh? But when our big Siberian cat developed bladder stones and a stubborn UTI, my research into her conditions led me to too many horror stories about the dangers of clumping clay litters. Eventually, I started seeing references to a cat litter made of pellets formed from shredded green tea leaves (a natural antimicrobial) which had solved health problems for other UTI-prone cats, and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Finding it was a challenge - although it's apparently the most popular cat litter in Japan, it's only carried by one small pet store within a 30-minute drive from our home. And expensive, whew! We nearly fainted. But that first bag was a life-changer for us and our kitties. All three cats took to it right away. It doesn't stick to their paws or their backsides, which did wonders for helping clear up the UTI. There's no added fragrance, but the litter itself has a light, herbal scent that's quite pleasant. It's so lightweight that I can carry three bags of it upstairs all by myself. And it's flushable! (Our three cats have all been tested and found parasite-free, so I flush with a clear conscience.) The urine clumps - which form under the surface of the litter - are just firm enough to scoop easily, and quickly dissolve when they hit the toilet water so you aren't actually flushing clumps. Buh-bye, Litter Locker!<br /><br />This litter doesn't control odor as well as the clay-crystals blend, but I've gotten in the habit of scooping/flushing every time I use the bathroom myself, so odor doesn't last long. The lightness of it means it scatters more than I like, but my cats scatter every litter anyway. At least it isn't painful to step on with bare feet! I keep a small whisk broom/dustpan combo next to the catbox and sweep up two or three times a day, as I've always done. I refuse to have a covered catbox for health reasons, but I do wish our box had higher sides! And I'm hoping as this brand becomes more popular, it will drop in cost and become easier to find. I'm happy to find it here on Amazon.<br /><br />Next Gen Green Tea Leaves cat litter isn't perfect, but it's darn close. So until they invent a cat litter that turns into rose petals when used and is self-regenerating, this one will do.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/24/11: They seem to have tweaked the formula for this cat litter - we've noticed it now seems more effective at controlling odor. We went out of town for four days, and the friend who came over to feed our cats completely forgot to scoop the catbox - for the entire time! With three cats using the same box, you'd think the odor would have alerted her. But even though when we got home the box was a mess, it still didn't stink. Amazing stuff.

review/summary: It's worth the price
review/text: The bottom line is, I pretty much test the limits of what our cat can tolerate regarding changing of the litter in the box.  I don't want to incriminate myself, but it's just not my favorite chore...This litter, although easily 3X the cost of what we used before (lately the newspaper remix versions), it lasts at least 2X longer between full changes of the box, so do consider that.  I think that the odor control is a little better, but there's no magic.  It must control the odor better from the cat's point of view, because she's OK with it.  I haven't noticed any downsides or trade-offs.

review/summary: Best cat litter ever!!
review/text: For the health of my kits, I will NOT use any type of clay litter - so went through all the other types and brands I could find.  Being a big-time green tea enthusiast, I decided to try Green Tea Leaves Cat Litter even though it was pricier and had to be shipped (not available locally).  I am totally pleased and impressed.  First, the litter is totally flushable which saves me many trips to the dumpster (we don't have our own garbage cans where I live) and that was a job I hated with a passion - especially during rainy weather.  Secondly, this litter never smells except for the nice odor from the components its made out of.  Third, my cats really like it!  Yes, it does track but no more than all the others - it's a nuisance but I guess it goes with owning cats and at least it's clean, not messy and dirty like some others I tried.  And fourth, a bag goes such a long ways that it's really not as expensive as it seems - actually I've found it to be way less expensive - and the bags are so light that I can handle them easily.  All in all I'm a happy camper now that I've found this litter - will never change (unless I can get the girls trained to use the real toilet {grin}!  By the way, my first order was from another source and I was horrified at the shipping charges -  Amazon offers free shipping on orders over $25 and this item qualifies so buy a couple of bags at a time and the price here is much better than anywhere else.

review/summary: Odor free and Flushable!
review/text: My cats adapted well to this litter, after rejecting anything made of corn. I have a septic tank, and I live in Africa where garbage disposal is an issue. I must have flushable litter.<br /><br />I find it a bit dusty, but that is not a big deal as my cats are not asthmatic. It tracks, and as someone noted, the big granules look like you have dumped granola on the floor. However, I find that it tracks only in a small area around the litter boxes. Perhaps this is because I put a rubber mesh carpet underpad under and next to my litter boxes, and this helps trap the scatter. The pellets of litter are very lightweight, a plus for me in transport, but they are soft, and my cats do not mind stepping on this litter. It takes a bit of care while scooping, as the clumps that form are soft and fragile. I don't mind, but it might drive another person nuts.<br /><br />The main issues--odor control, cat acceptance, and flushability--are fully met by this product. And for my esthetic sensibilities, I rather like the green tea scent, and I love that it is 100% recycled.

review/text: Since I first used this product, I won't use any other brand.  It seems my local pet and grocery stores can't keep it in stock, so I just order it every month through Amazon.  This product doesn't try to mask catbox odors with equally bad floral odors.  Instead, the real green tea used in this product seems to absorb the bad odors, leaving no odor at all.  What a relief.

review/summary: Great odor control makes me a lazy litter cleaner...
review/text: After finding out about the environmental impacts of mining to extract the materials for regular cat litter, which also just piles up landfills and does NOT decompose, I began trying natural litters.  I have tried every single natural litter that is sold in pet stores that I've ever seen (Feline Pine, World's Best, Nature's Miracle, Yesterday's News, corn-based, clumping and non, etc.).  I've also used a variety of non-bioderadable litters in the past, such as "crystals", ones with baking powder, and more.  This is by far the most superior, and the urine odor control beats all types; the only caveat is that it is not "perfumed" like some regular litters, so if that strong (and awful, IMHO) perfumed litter smell is your preference, you won't get it here.<br /><br />It also does not clump AS hard as some regular litters, but it does clump just fine.  Just don't shake the scoop too vigorously when sifting the clumps.  The tradeoff if you choose smaller-grained natural litters, which sometimes clumps tighter, is a LOT more tracking.  This litter tracks very little because the large pellets are less likely to get stuck in their paws.  Yet the pellets dissolve with moisture and thus are able to break apart & coagulate to do their job.  Just get a wider-slatted scoop if you are having trouble with the litter "pellets" not sifting through.  I even use this litter with a (semi) self-cleaning litterbox (the Omega Paw) and it works just fine.  I struggle to find this litter in stores and recommend that you purchase locally if you can find it; thankfully you can buy it online in a pinch.<br /><br />PROs:<br />1) Less tracking than your average litter<br />2) Almost no dust<br />3) Safe for kitty's lungs and digestive system<br />4) Fantastic odor control, thus less frequent scooping required<br />5) Clumping!<br />6) Lasts a very long time, offsetting litter cost<br />7) Very lightweight & easy to carry<br />8) Smells nice<br />9) Biodegradable (but try to use BioBags for the waste - the compost bin size works great)<br /><br />CONs:<br />1) Can be hard to find (more likely to be at your local independent pet store, which is better than a nationwide chain anyway)<br />2) Not eligible for Amazon Prime<br />3) Not as tightly clumping as regular litter<br />4) Plastic packaging is not recyclable or biodegradable<br /><br />Bottom line: I'm very picky about litter and tend to try every option before claiming loyalty to one product (if ever). This product is on my short list.

review/text: I love this litter and it is well worth the money.  First of all its light and I no longer have to lug heavy bags or boxes home from the store.  Even though it clumps well around my cat's waste, it can be shaken off and the waste disposed of in my toilet.  I do this every day.  There is absolutely no odor anymore and no more little pieces of cat litter and dust being tracked out of the box.  I wish I had known about this before but I'm grateful I know of it now.  My cat is fine with it and acts as though nothing has changed.  I give this 5 stars because there aren't more stars available.

review/summary: Love how lightweight this is!
review/text: I have to climb 2 flights of stairs (and walk a good distance) from my car to my apartment. This is so much easier to carry than clay litter. It is very lightly scented (from being made of tea leaves) - a big plus, as I hate the icky perfumey smell of most clay litters.<br /><br />I read other reviews...I've never noticed the dust.<br /><br />Also, this did have a more granular shape when it first came out. It is now pellets, but my cat uses it just fine. I'll probably jinx myself here, but he is 16 and has never 'gone' anywhere but his litter box.<br /><br />It does track, but I bought one of those spiky plastic door mats to put in front of the cat box and it all ends up in there. When I clean the box, I shake the door mat over it. Works for me.<br /><br />I hope they never stop making this stuff!!

review/summary: very disappointing
review/text: I really wanted to love this litter, but it just didn't impress me. I have 4 cats and 4 litter boxes that I scoop at least once a day so I am (sadly) a litter expert. I agree that there's significantly less dust and the little dust there is doesn't seem as irritating as the dust from the Tidy Cat scoopable litter I use. That's not a big deal for me though as I just pour the Tidy Cat slowly and turn my head away so the dust doesn't bother me. On the plus side, this litter weighs significantly less than traditional litter, which is nice when you have to lug it around. My cats were very willing to use it, but they are pretty easy going and have never "boycotted" the litter box for any reason as some cats do when you make a change. Now, for what I didn't like...<br /><br />I was really hoping for something that didn't get tracked all over the house, but I actually found that this was tracked further and quicker than my other litter. I'm sure of this because I only used this new litter in one box on the far side of the house so it was easy to see where and how fast it was scattered throughout the house. In terms of tracking litter, I actually found this to be more annoying than the Tidy Cat because these pellets are bigger. It was uncomfortable when I accidentally stepped on this litter in my bare feet (which happened often since it was tracked so far) and the bigger pieces show up more easily so it also looked really messy. To be fair, 2 of my 4 cats have long hair so litter gets trapped in the fur on their feet and I guess it was just worse with this stuff.<br /><br />This litter did provide good odor control, but I found it to be no better than my Tidy Cat scoop litter. Though the odor control was decent, the litter doesn't change color or otherwise indicate when it's been saturated by liquid waste and the "clumps" fell apart easily so I had to either scoop too much to be sure I got it all or risk leaving dirty litter in the box. That drove me crazy since this litter is pretty expensive if you have to throw away more than necessary just to be sure the box was clean. Because of this issue, I went through the bag more quickly than they estimate in the instructions.<br /><br />I suppose if the dust and the weight of traditional litter are big problems for you or if you really want to be able to flush your litter, this may be your solution. If you are looking for an alternative that is significantly better in terms of tracking, odor and cost, I don't recommend this at all. Also, the shipping costs were much too high (I searched everywhere online to be sure there wasn't a better deal) so be sure you factor that into the cost.

review/summary: Disappointing Mess
review/text: Sorry to dash anybody's hopes here. I know the reviews are pretty glowing, but that does not match my experience. This litter is not good. The chunks are huge, which not only seemed to make it hard for my cats to use, but looked disturbingly like granola when tracked all over the room. And track it does... like crazy. Which defeated my reason for buying it. Thankfully, on a tip, I switched to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005D4NXI4">Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat Respiratory Relief Litter - 20 lb</a> and I highly recommend it. It clumps well, tracks the least of the six or seven litters I've tried, and as an added bonus is completely dust-free (since it's made for cats with respiratory problems). Hope that helps. I know what a frustrating process this search can be and am very glad to be finally done with it.

review/summary: Does Not Live Up to Expectation
review/text: I had high hopes for this litter after having it highly recommended from a local pet store. The plus was that it was super light and the bag claimed that 10 liters was to last a single cat a month! I happily cleaned out the old litter and replaced it with the green tea leaves and found that in actuality the odor control was not that great. We have a small apartment and must keep the litter box in the foyer, so if the box is not fresh you smell it immediately upon entering. While it seemed to do pretty well with concealing urine smells it took many hours (like 4-6) before the poop smell was absorbed. I resorted to pouring baking soda in the box everyday even after cleaning it and it still smelled bad. Also, while it claims to be low tracking, we still found these large pellets all over the house. This bag that was claimed to last a month ended up lasting less then two weeks...we are moving on to the next litter.

review/summary: Best Cat Litter Ever!
review/text: I will only use biodegradable & flushable cat litter.  Before I tried Next Gen Green Tea Litter, I had used World's Best (corn-based), a wheat cat litter (Sweet & Simple, I think) and another which was ground nut shells.<br /><br />In the hot weather the World's Best produced maggots.  The Wheat-based litter attracted very small flying insects and the ground nut shells created a red tinge on the toilet bowl requiring heavy duty washing.<br /><br />They all produced dust which translated to my cats tracking the litter all over the apartment.<br /><br />About 9 months ago and after much web surfing I found a website that contained only product reviews sans promos and blogs.  I was extremely impressed by the description of this litter:  no tracking through the home, no bugs of any kind and it absorbs the odor very well!<br /><br />I've never done a review but I hope a lot of you read this and try Next Gen.  It's the best--  It's a little expensive but so well worth it.  Amazon.com is the best place to buy it if you are not in California as pet stores and chains like Petco & PetSmart have not caught on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AN0NYS">Green Tea Leaves Cat Litter - 7 liters</a>yet.

review/summary: High scattering, low clumping, bad smelling
review/text: As a tea lover, I can tell you that associating one of my favorite smells (dried tea leaves) with the odor of feces and urine hasn't been one of my favorite experiences. If you like the smell of tea leaves (and I recognize that many people don't), the litter is fine when new and dry. But once a cat actually uses the litter, the smell just mixes with poop and pee. It turns out, poop and pee smell bad, but poop and pee mixed with green tea smells awful.<br /><br />Also, while the pellet size is larger than most clumping litter, the tracking is actually worse because the pellets are very light weight for their size. Plus, clumping is below average. I tried to use this in a sifting litter box, and the litter doesn't stick strong enough for the clumps to keep their shape.

review/summary: Did not like this AT ALL.
review/text: I was enchanted by the 'tea essence', but I was not at all pleased.  It did not cover the odor and my apartment reeked while using this.  Not to mention, the green tea litter was tracked all over.  Guess my cat is big on tossing it up...His stools would actually stick to the bottom of the pan with this stuff.  Anyway, more importantly is the high dust content in the litter.  My cat developed upper respiratory issues from it and would sneeze and wheeze.  I didn't like pouring it out of the bag either because it would emit a cloud of dust into the air.<br /><br />Also, the scooper I have has pretty large filters, but not big enough for the large litter balls...so I felt like I was wasting a lot of litter with each cleaning.  Needless to say, we went through this pretty fast.  It just wasn't working out.  I have since switched cat litters and am a happy camper, and so is my cat who is having less and less respiratory issues each day.

review/text: I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control.

I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ($11 WHAT?!?).<br /><br />Personally, the flavor is too much for me, but my mom & aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips.

review/summary: Quite good
review/text: I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag.

review/text: I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.

review/summary: Salty and vinegary!!!
review/text: These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).

review/summary: A unique flavor for fans of Thai food
review/text: These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and "spices." I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions "tear here." So easy. Why didn't I think of that.

review/summary: Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good
review/text: Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.

review/text: For me, Kettle is the best brand on the market. They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods! I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors.

review/text: What I like about them:<br />1) Very thick chips.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

review/summary: A delicious, crisp chip with good flavor
review/text: I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!

review/summary: Convenience at low cost
review/text: I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!

review/text: OK,I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful. I took the plunge as I do like salty, and tangy flavors. No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)

review/summary: Excellent Thai-flavored chip
review/text: I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting.

Not to salty not too bland. They are a little oily but that's ok. The best thing is the 2 oz package. When I buy a larger bag it's harder to resist eating them all.  This 2 oz package allows for a little "portion control". Be sure to use your scissors to open, 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and don't open easily. Enjoy!

review/summary: Not quite the best...
review/text: In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips,  from the best I've ever had to big disappointments.  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products.  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice.

review/text: Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss.  Some of their flavors are terrible.  But this is very simple and delicious.  Probably one of their best flavors.<br /><br />Pros: Thick, crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesn't compromise on taste, eco-friendly business that isn't just giving us lip service<br /><br />Cons: The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open.

The best thing was that there were a lot of "brown" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.

review/summary: Fabulous!
review/text: These chips are some of the best I've tasted. They are not filled with chemicals. You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato. Not greasy. Perfectly crispy. If you don't like salt and vinegar tanginess, don't even bother to try. These definitely have zip. I love them. My children and their friends love them. Even my 4 year old loves them!

review/text: I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends.  :))  My experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side.  But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind.  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I don't have to buy them from the store anymore.

review/summary: Not bad but a little hard to get used to
review/text: My husband likes these a lot. They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however.

review/summary: Prefer other flavors
review/text: I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again.

review/text: I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat.

review/text: I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked! They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag. They definitely need to improve that!

review/text: A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim , "these will change your life!"  While my life is fairly unchanged, I cannot get enough of these chips . . . . and I do not even like kettle chips.  For the most part, I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy, but the flavor of these chips is amazing!  The are the type of hot that is refreshing.  If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things . . . try these anyway, they may convert you.

review/text: These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted.  It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.

review/text: This is easily the best potato chip that I have ever had.  Look at the ingredients:  Ginger and 3 types of hot pepper.  How can you go wrong?<br /><br />Obviously, not for you if you don't like spicy food. But, if you DO like spicy food, you'll probably love these.  They have that hot-with-a-hint-of-sweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food.

review/summary: Tangy, spicy, and sweet- oh my!
review/text: Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.

review/text: I don't write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted.  Every flavor is dynamite.  If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon, I would recommend cheddar beer, absolutely amazing.  And they're healthy!  (besides a lil fat)  I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake.  Enjoy, and don't eat them too fast.
