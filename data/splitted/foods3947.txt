review/summary: Some melted product
review/text: I have received and used this product several times in the past few months and love the taste. This order arrived with part of the product melted and re-solidified. I was at home when the product arrived. It was on my porch no longer than a minute or so. It was not melted when I opened it shortly after I retrieved it, but had melted and re-solidified sometime before arrival. Many of the pieces had melted and were stuck together. The product looks OK, except for the melted pieces, but the taste of the melted pieces is somewhat suspect. Amazon was kind enough to credit my account for the purchase.

review/summary: Brookside Acai Blueberry
review/text: These are the most delicious snacks I have had in quite awhile. The first time I have ever had them was when I located them in one of the stores I shop. When I went to get some more, they did not have any, so I decided to go on Amazon and I was so thrilled to see them there! If you have not tried them, then please do! You will glad to have found them! They are most nutritious and delicious at the same time! Jan Hughes

review/summary: Good Chocolate. Concentrated Juices Center.
review/text: I just can't resist stuff like this. Not only is it delicious, but it offers certain health benefits. It's Brookside Dark Chocolate with Acai Blueberry centers. Mmmmm. Are these good? Careful, you'll overdose. The chocolate is excellent. The center is made out of concentrated juices of blueberries and other fruits. Nice combination! I picked up my 2 pound bag at Costco, but I see they're available online too. I also picked up a bag os Brookside Dark Chocolate with Pomegranate centers, but I like the Blueberry best by a slight margin. Nice Candy!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Treat for Special Occasions
review/text: Obviously these are not a health food, but a wonderful treat with pure, lucious, dark chocolate covering real fruit juice pieces.  Because of their sugar content, they must be eaten in limited amounts.  Also, since they are formed like a medium- sized marble, they need to be kept away from small children who might choke on them. I love to serve them to company and they always get rave reviews, though I really like to keep most of them for my husband and myself and I have to hide them from my daughter and daughter-in-law.  Yum! Yum!

review/summary: Dark Chocolate at its Best
review/text: Brookside Dark Chocolate Acai with Blueberry is the best dark chocolate that I have ever enjoyed.  Somehow the fruit flavors enhance the dark chocolate flavor and the center filling has just enough, but not too much sugar. Portion control is easy. I allow myself one handful every day and the flavor is so intense that this is enough to satisfy my lifelong chocolate craving.<br /><br />Even people who tell me they don't like chocolate like this product.

review/text: These blueberry-chocolate nubbins are astonishingly good as to taste and texture.

review/text: I first purchased these at Costco but since I don't always see them there, I jumped at the chance to order them when I saw them on Amazon.  If you're not a big dark chocolate fan, I still recommend them because the chocolate is pretty mellow, not bitter like some dark chocolates.  I love the taste of these and I almost feel like the calories are canceled out because of all the good things acai, blueberries, and dark chocolate do for you!  I'll be buying more!

review/text: These may not have the 'berry' inside of them, but the fruit juice concentrate at the centers instead of a sugary candy is so much better.  These things are delicious and really cut the chocolate craving.  I get both the acai/blueberry and the pomegranate and take about 6 of each...I'm done with chocolate for the day - on an average day.  I feel better that they are more healthful than many other chocolate covered candies.  Yes it would be great if these were real berries instead of a jelly, but that doesn't mean they aren't a perfect treat.  You have to be a little sinful to really make it a treat anyhow don't you!  The price is great too.  Just wish the site that offered the better price would also offer amazonprime shipping.

review/summary: Wayyy too *tangy!*
review/text: Usually I make my own stir fry sauce but one evening for the sake of ease I decided to get this. Oh, my... God... Big. Mistake. First off, let me say that this sauce isn't necessarily bad tasting. It's just that the flavor is too overpowering, like Kikkoman overdid it on the soy and vinegar. As soon as you taste it, you're going to be knocked back by an overwhelming sensation of tanginess and fermented soy. Because the sauce was so strong, I double-checked the instructions to make sure if I wasn't supposed to add water or something else extra to dilute it. But nope, you're supposed to pour it straight onto your meal when it's almost finished cooking.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that my meal was completely ruined by this sauce but that it took some effort to get through because of the overpowering "tangy" taste and the unusual flavor. (Although for Asian-style meals, it doesn't really taste like any flavor you've ever encountered in Asian stir-fry). Because I don't like to throw out food, I'm going to try to make do with the half a bottle of this sauce I have left by adding a little sugar to neutralize the tanginess. Once I do that, that's it-- I'm done with this sauce. I definitely will not be buying it again or recommending it to anyone. If you're tempted to buy it, though, I suggest having additional ingredients handy to dilute its overpowering flavor, especially sugar if you also find it a little too tangy.

review/summary: One of the actual 10 Great Teas!!! This is an excellent product and extremly rare...
review/text: Generation is the only American distributor that offers this fine tea. (Very similar to the more common Fujian province Silver Needle; with a very unique taste and aroma, kind of smooth and nutty and less astringent.) It's grown I believe near the Fujian area on the Junshan mountain which is prestigious in the tea world and has been known for centuries for tea they produce there: that the Emperors themselves have hailed as great.<br /><br />I've been reading about it all over from the Wikipedia to anywhere else I could find out about it online. I received a sample of it from the very gracious people over at Generation when I inquired about it ordering my first order of gourmet loose leaf white tea. I immediately fell in love with yellow tea and Generation, but being new to the world of ordering loose leaf teas online (or anywhere else for that matter) I've tried to find it somewhere else to have something to compare it to. I've looked all over for it and Generation is the only place I can find it in the US.<br />This is a great tea and for any fans of white tea it's definitely a tea I would recommend trying.

review/summary: Refuting the 2-Star Review.
review/text: Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina  Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked "natural"), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]

review/summary: Worth the price
review/text: Our female Ridgeback pup didn't have the iron gut the breed is know for, and quality lamb or fowl- based foods continued to cause loose, very smelly stool and a gassy dog.  (We measure and feed, wetted, twice daily.) At around six months a friend (and pet supply store owner) put me in touch with his dog expert.  She suggested this Holistic Select food.  We've used both the duck and seafood mixes, but now stick with the seafood mix.  Her stool immediately firmed up to a surprisingly firm and almost odor free (!) state. No more gas.  Her coat is beautiful, I mean strikingly. We've used it for almost a year now.  No fish breath issues, but we're sushi lovers anyway...<br />So, taking all that into consideration, and if you don't overfeed your dog and waste food, the price is in-line.  I got cheap a month or so ago and bought a slightly cheaper salmon-yam mix by another manufacturer and noticed immediate effects.  I'm back on track.

review/summary: Came highly recommended by our dogs breeder
review/text: Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health, Lamb Meal Dry Dog Food came highly recommended by our Rhodesian Ridgeback breeder. The man has done extensive research to find the best dog food available for the breed he so dearly loves and in his opinion this dog food is IT.<br /><br />We first started our dog out on the 'LARGE $ GIANT BREED" puppy food by Holistic Select and around age 8-9 months we switched to the adult version. We serve this dog food twice a day with warm water and add a fish oil capsule and probiotics to it. With his dinner our dog also gets 1 tbs of canned Holistic Select as a special treat.<br /><br />Our Rhodesian Ridgeback is a happy and content dog, his coat looks awesome and up to now he never has had any problems with his digestion.<br /><br />Being able to buy this large bag of dog food at Amazon is awesome and a great deal. The cheapest I can find this dog food in a local store is $50 and then I have to drive to and from the store and haul the big bag myself. Thank to Amazon this huge bag is now delivered at my doorstep.

review/text: To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your "wrathful" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs.

review/summary: It all comes down to reading the ingredient label.
review/text: Selecting a healthy dog food is just like selecting healthy food for yourself:  You have to read the label.  You're want specifically named sources of protein like "chicken" or "chicken meal" and  you do not want things like "meat byproduct."  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the "Holistic"label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become.

review/summary: For a dog with sensitivity to chicken...
review/text: Living on an island with very limited access to premium dog foods, I rely heavily on ordering from Amazon and especially the Super Saver Shipping to make taking care of our pets affordable.  Recently, Amazon stopped offering SSS on a lot of the dog foods that I had loved and that were really working for my 40# mixed breed dog who is sensitive to chicken.  Since the cost of most of those foods doubled because of shipping, I decided to try Holistic Select to mix with her grain-free, venison- and fish-based foods to extend our supply.  She's been doing really well for the last three months on a blend of half Holistic Select, and half higher-quality foods.  She seems to really enjoy her meals still, so the taste must be okay.  I understand that there is some chicken in this food, but it is not a top ingredient and she hasn't had many problems from it.  I have noticed that she requires a bit more food now than before, and her waste is "bulkier," too, so it is apparent to me that there are more fillers in this food than I would like.  However, it has been a very good solution for us while we work on an alternative source of the foods we would prefer.  It has also worked very well for a friend who wanted to find a healthier food than she could find at the supermarkets, but isn't ready to make the leap to premium pet foods.  Her dog has been very happy and seems to be thriving since the change.

review/summary: Great food for a dog with a sensitive stomach
review/text: My dog had minor GI system issues and wasn't excited about her food, but when she went to my parents' house she'd steal their dogs' Duck Meal food (my parents had switched to it because their lab had allergies and the vet suggested it). Once I switched to Holistic Select, her GI issues were gone and now she gobbles it up as soon as it hits the bowl. I never intended to buy fancy food for my pet, but it's also nice to know her food doesn't have scary additives in it. This brand can be hard to find in normal pet stores so I'm glad Amazon sells it and with SuperSaver shipping!

review/text: I researched for the healthiest, least filler type food.  I live in the Washington, DC area where there are lots of police K-9 dog owners.  They recommend the Holistic.  It turns out that you can serve much less for the same amount of nutrition as all the other popular brands so 30lb. goes for two months for my 45 lb dog!  I keep ordering online from Amazon and my ordering records show an order every two months.  Shows up in two days delivered! The veterinarian always comments on my dog's healthy coat and leanness. I only wish it could be on the subscription feature so that it would automatically be ordered and worry free, but there are more important things in life to worry about, right!?

Theres better options on the merket, they make cost little more, but at least you're not getting jipped.

review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: I adopted a pug several months ago. I was told that she suffered from "itchy butt" which is common in pugs. I was given some allergy pills and told I should give them to her whenever I noticed her trying to scratch herself. I'm not really the type of person who likes to dish out the meds if they aren't really needed so, I figured I would try to change her diet and see if that helped. My  veterinarian recommended that fish oils might help with the itchiness. After doing a lot of research online I decided to give Holsitic Selects a shot. I used to have boxers and always fed them Eagle Pack which they did very well on so I thought this sister brand would be a safe bet. It turns out that it was. My dog loves the food and has not needed any kind of allergy pill in months. People are always commenting on how soft her coat is too. I have also started giving their feline formula to our cats who seem to enjoy it as well. Another great thing about this food is that it is made in the USA and they use all USA grown ingredients which was a huge reason why I chose them. Also, if you join their online community they send you coupons every month for $3-$5 off a bag of dry food and a few $$$ off of wet food or treats too.

review/text: Athena my toy fox terrier was having a lot of problems with chewing on her feet, course hair and noisy scratching just after she turned two. She had always shed a lot. If you wore a black shirt her white hair would cover you. If you wore a white one her 3 inch patch of black fur was enough to cover you in black fur. I was about to make a vet appt. for the chewing and itching. I stopped at a dog food store and was just going to pick up a good dog brush for the shedding. The salesman asked what was wrong and then guided me to this food. She didn't love it at first but loved the dog treats. I think the treats hooked her on the food. No more chewing after about a week. Hardly no scratching and her shedding is less then 1/4 of what it used to be. Not to mention people now comment on how soft she is. I love this food. However for a dog that has NEVER had bad breath she now has fish breath. Thus the four stars.

review/summary: Excellent Quality; my dogs LOVE it!
review/text: I have 5-7 dogs at any given time, sometimes feeding as many as 4 different foods at once. I show dogs in AKC conformation and foster rescue dogs. I look for a high-grade kibble that meets each of their dietary needs, keeps them in optimal condition (skin/coat) and most importantly, that they will eat! I have one dog that will only eat small bites, and several other dogs that are FINICKY.  I tried it on a whim (can you say SALE) and now I LOVE LOVE LOVE this food...Sure, it may seem expensive, but I believe if you feed a high-quality food you save money on vet bills down the road and help insure your pets longevity.  My dogs look and feel great after 6 months on it. I've fed MANY brands of high-grade kibble over the years, this one takes the cake.

review/text: My dog likes this food and is healthy. I like that her stools are easy to deal with, which they were not when we tried several other foods. After reading some reviews, I had hoped for a miraculous cure for her scratching and foot chewing, but instead got a slight improvement over time.<br /><br />I highly recommend signing up at their website. They routinely give out $3 off coupons and sometimes have special offers for $5 off (for which you might have to complete a survey or "like" them on Facebook, for instance). Being on their email list has not generated any junk mail for me. They seem to only send out an email once or twice a month which is well within my tolerance.<br /><br />On a whim I bought some of Holistic Select's dog biscuits and my dog absolutely loves them, more than any treat I've tried. She likes them better than Little Jacs. They are maybe tied with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188ZDZU">Holistic Select Salmon Recipe Natural Dog Treats, 6-Ounce Bag</a>. The treats I bought are not yet offered on amazon. They are called Holistic Select Wheat Free Holistix with Whitefish, Cranberries, Apples & Blueberries Natural Biscuits for Dogs. They are easy to break in half for using as rewards.

review/summary: Good food for English bulldog
review/text: We just switched our English Bulldog from bulldog food to this food because she has a bad rash and we can't seem to get rid of it. The person that sold us the dog recommended it. I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.

review/summary: Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS
review/text: We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb.

review/summary: Super for my Shiba
review/text: My little Shiba just can't handle chicken or grain byproducts. I love the ingredients, I love that my dog is enthusiastic about the food and I love that I can buy it on Amazon.com and have it delivered.<br /><br />The tiny kibble is great for smaller mouths but is on the harder side when it comes to dry. I have used pro-plan in the past and notice the shredded mix has much softer/grainy kibble. I sometimes moisten the food with a little bit of pet-friendly topping.<br /><br />The mix is nutrient and calorie dense. You may have to tweak your volume, depending on what you're switching from.

review/text: We have a corgi and this kibble is one of the only two things that the breeder recommended. Unfortunately our dog does not like this food. He would NEVER eat a pellet on its own. We always have to mix it with real food and even then he sometimes refuses to eat it. On top of that none of the pet shops in our area carry this food so overall big PITA.<br /><br />We are still ordering from Amazon but looking for an alternative.

This could be the best dog food out there, but if the quality control is bad, I won't be buying it. I'll add pictures of the mold or whatever is growing on the dog food.

review/summary: Very Pleased
review/text: I have been feeding my cocker spaniel holistic select for over 4 years, and I have been very pleased!  Recently I have discovered Amazon's auto-shipment of the dog food which is great, since the stores that sell it is quite a drive.  My cocker spaniel has had severe ear problems (as many cockers do) and the vet recommended a prescription dog food, after doing research, I decided on holistic select instead, and his ears are so much better!  They went from "chronic" to just irritated, and the vet was very pleased with his improvement.  He loves this food, and would eat it constantly if I let him!  I would recommend this dog food to anyone!

review/text: First I love this food. My pup has food allergies and she has gone through many top foods because of it. This is the first food in her 4years that I have been able to keep her on for more then a couple months.  I buy the large bag and have two dogs that it will feed for almost a month before needing more and both my dogs look and feel healthy and happy. No more chewing paws or stratching like crazy.  Both dogs also run to their feeding spot as soon as I get the bag out. Fishy smell is nothing compared to the help it gives my dogs. Shipping is always fast and hassle free. Love this product. Best thing I've done for my dogs outside of rescuing them :)

review/summary: Content means less than names
review/text: I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, "Holistic",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or "natural" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?

review/summary: Creates great jambalaya meals
review/text: We tried this jambalaya seasoning mix instead of getting the Zatarain's mixes that we usually get that include the rice. It made a great meal for us with plenty of leftovers and it was a big hit with our little family.<br /><br />If you were adding extra veggies to the Zatarain mix, using this mix won't really increase your up-front prep time. We added a bell pepper, a large onion and two celery sticks.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to simmer (for about 45 minutes) to get the best results but that is just 'waiting' time if one plans ahead. From start to finish, it took us about an hour to prepare this meal.<br /><br />I scanned and uploaded extra images of the package to the product image area. The rear of the package shows the instructions/recipe as well as a list of ingredients needed to make the recipe.

review/summary: Fun stuff
review/text: The package in the store looks a little different than the one in the Amazon picture. So I hope it's printed on this package.<br /><br />The recipe is relatively easy.  I throw one curveball into it. I use 1 lb of defrosted shrimp and a defrosted chicken breast or a couple of boneless thighs.<br /><br />So if you look at the recipe list, bell pepper, celery, onion - all cheap total less than $2. 2 cups rice and water cheap less than a buck. a can of diced tomatoes - $1. a chicken breast/2 thighs, $2 or so (fresh or organic a lot more). 1lb sausage - hillshire farms? $2-4 depending on flavor/brand. than shrimp - $5-10 a lb.  So if we average things out it's $16.<br /><br />You need some time and space - dicing veggies and meat. deshelling shrimp takes some time. Then cooking the meat, first and having some place to put it while the veggies cook is a little extra, not sure you need to do this part, but I do. Then watching over it take 30 minutes or so. So from dicing to adding the rice can take 45 minutes depending.<br /><br />But it creates a lot of food. A lot more than my quicker more homemade Jambalaya recipe. 4+ meals. very flavorful meals I might add.  Also the Sausage is the main source of fat.<br /><br />It's not a quick recipe, but it's worth having a packet around for some really flavorful rice, veggies and protein. All in one pot... kinda see above paragraphs.

review/summary: My cats won't eat anything else!
review/text: I try to feed my 2 cats organic foods, with no by-products in it. This food fits my requirements. Plus both of my cats LOVE this food. They even refuse to eat moist foods of any kind now. Their coats are shiny, they are lean and energetic!! Neither one overeats this food. My older cat was always plump when fed the famous name brand foods. Her coat was dull and brittle. Now it's shiny and soft. I love this food too, because I could feed it to the youngest when she was a kitten and not have to look for another 'adult' cat food when she turned a year. I love that I can order it online from Amazon.com. I find it less expensive on Amazon.com and I don't have to hunt for it in various stores. It's delivered to my doorstep. I highly recommend this food to all cat lovers! Just leave some for my cats!!:)

Now for the next question -- does your cat like it! Mine did, and she absolutely refuses to eat cheap foods, digging them out of her bowl and batting them around the kitchen floor to let me know what she thinks about them if i try to feed them to her. The manufacturer has used one of the same processing plants that Blue Buffalo and Natural Balance used in the past.

review/summary: Subscribe and Save a great value on a great cat food
review/text: I'm writing this review to add another strong voice in support of the quality and value of the Harmony dry cat food. Like the other reviewers, I had searched long and far for a food that fit my tough guidelines for healthy ingredients.  I found the indoor formula Harmony cat food at my local supermarket, was impressed after reading the ingredients list and decided to try it on my six cats ranging in age from 1 to 15 years old.  Each cat, without exception, took to the food right away.  When I found the chicken and rice formula at Wegman's (40 miles away), I switched my cats to that because I was concerned that the indoor formula for outdoor cats might not be the right balance of nutrients since Harmony went to the trouble of developing two varieties.  Once again, my cats took to the food right away.  I feed them dry and wet food and decided to try the Harmony canned.  In the past, I needed to mix some of the food I was trying to replace with the new food--but that was not necessary with the Harmony food.  I've been a cat caregiver for most of my 59 years.  I have never found a cat food that was so well received by my feline friends as Harmony.  In fairness to the single one star reviewer in this group, I looked up the Royal Canin brand.  I was not positively impressed by the ingredients list.  Besides that, Royal Canin has at least 3 varieties of dry food--a protein, a smell enhanced, and a texture variety. Huh?  I just wonder if all of the 1 star reviewer's 60 felines can agree on the same variety! On the point of the value of purchasing this food through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, it is by far the best pricing I've found.  Wegman's--again 40 miles away!--sells it for $12.99 with a Wegman's card--$14.99 without.  Through this program, currently I can get the food delivered to my doorstep for $12.66--no more long drives to Wegman's and less expensive to boot!

review/text: I decided to return to a natural food for my male cat. He has the tendency to overeat and I battle to keep him at a healthy weight. This food has MEAT as the first ingredient; this is rare to find. It is also available at my local grocery store. Not only does he love it, my little adult female does too. She sneaks over and steals from the male's bowl when he has left some food. For medical purposes she is on kitten food, so I do not feed her the same food. I was hoping that with no fillers, my cat would fell more satisfied. I mix up fiber powder and water with the male's cat food and he is more satisfied and usually does not beg for more food.  I just wish the company made a larger bag than 6.5.

review/text: We've tried a variety of different cat foods over the past year or so and this was our ultimate winner.  One of our cats has some GI issues and while we never got a straight diagnosis, they appear to be related to gluten consumption.  We had them on prescription cat food but given that there are 4 of them (and only 1 with the issue) this was getting expensive.  We gave this a try and while the GI issues didn't 100% go away, they became significantly better (as much so or more so than when on the prescription food).  Perhaps most importantly, it was generally healthy for all the cats and they all loved it.

review/text: My older cat was begining to have stomach problems.  It came on suddenly and I felt that it was due to a change of ingredients put in her dry cat food.  I began to look for a higher grade of food and read multi reviews on products.  I felt that Harmony Farms had the most consistent positive reviews.  Also owners with cats who were having digestive issues seem to have a higher percentage of improvement when changed to Harmony Farms. She had dramatic improvement almost immediately.  She still is having ocasional issues but she had developed severe inflammatory problems.  Take great caution in considering what you feed your pets.  I changed my dog as well!!  It was a good decision and I am very pleased with Harmony Farms and Amazons shipping it to my home.

review/text: First, it arrived exactly in two days thanks to the prime shipping! So that's already a star there.<br /><br />Anyway, I adopted a cat recently who was a bit on the heavier side and a little bit older (3 years old). I wanted to give him the best food possible and wanted to make sure he would be happy and healthy. Also, the food that I was feeding him was the atrocious Walmart "Special Kitty" brand so anything was better than that.<br /><br />I didn't even need to transition my cat at all. The second I opened the package to feed him his first bowl he was all over me! Would NOT leave me alone until there was kibbles to be eaten in his bowl. Now whenever he hears me putting food in his bowl he comes running. He loves the stuff.<br /><br />He already seems more active and alert after just a couple days of eating this awesome food. The price wasn't too shabby either compared to other natural/holistic cat food brands.

review/summary: Great cat food
review/text: Amazon offers this food at a great price. My local supermarket no longer carries this food after the jumped in price to $15.79 a bag. My cat really likes the food and he is extremely picky. I went through 4 other types of "holistic"  before he would even taste one. That's how we found Harmony Farms cat food.

review/summary: 60 cats refused the taste!
review/text: Multiple homes, total of 60 cherished cats who are given premium foods. The ingredients & reviews made me try this food; not 1 cat liked the taste, which is a first. Gave the bag to the wildlife reserve raccoons, who did consume it. I am unlikely to venture again from the Royal Canin varieties they adore, and does make their fur glow!

review/summary: If you love radishes...
review/text: ...especially hot ones, these are the radish for you!  My first sprouting attempt was with Sango radishes in a jar in my kitchen.  They were delicious and intense in that spicy radish taste...tiny, but they pack a lot of flavor.  Full-grown red garden radishes from your average supermarket taste like flavorless styrofoam in comparison.

review/summary: best. tea. ever.
review/text: Okay, that might be a slight exaggeration seeing as how I haven't tried every tea in existence, but this tea is pretty darn good.  While I cannot speak to quality of the distributor, the actual flavor of the tea is pretty amazing.  It's a sweet, herbal flavor that's mild but tasty and brews light like a true chamomile.  While it's fabulous on its own I used it for an impromptu chai-style latte with steamed french vanilla coconut milk coffee creamer (So Delicious brand) and I was in heaven!  I will now be ordering this en masse to carry around with me to drink EVERYwhere and I will tell EVERYone who is within earshot that they are silly for not drinking this and this alone.  ForEVER.<br /><br />Twinings, I'm in luuurve!

review/summary: These are great!
review/text: I ordered these as a Lightning Deal. Never tried it but it was like 50% off. I love spicy food and can never find anything I consider "spicy" anymore. Cooked these expecting "spicy" to be "tangy" as usual. WRONG!<br /><br />I drained 95% of the water out like I do with Ramen Noodles. Put the flavor packet on, and WOW it was SPICY. But I love it - great flavor. I had to cool my mouth down with chocolate milk. This from a guy who always orders the spiciest level at any ethnic eatery I go to.<br /><br />I'm sure if you don't drain all the water out before eating like I do, it will be fine. I plan on draining about 75% out next time. Finally, a food labeled "spicy" that actually is!

review/summary: From a Nong Shim Bowl Noodle Fan
review/text: I'm eating these for the first time as I type. (I've written reviews on the double 12-packs of Bowl Noodle, by the way, if you want to know my opinion of Bowl Noodle in general.) Shin Bowl Noodle are every bit Bowl Noodle (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PDO2YC">Nong Shim Bowl Noodle, Kimchi, 3.03-Ounce Packages, 12-Count (Pack of 2)</a>). This particular flavor's very spicy and oozes the essence of black pepper. All-in-all, this is like gourmet Bowl Noodle. It has more soup base and it's thicker; the vegetables are higher-quality and revive better than those in Bowl Noodle, and are more flavorful. If you're a Nong Shim fan, this is a must-buy! If you like Hot and Spicy Bowl Noodle, especially, or just any Bowl Noodle variety, you're going to like this.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious!
review/text: If you like food with a kick these are the noodles for you. I can't even eat a regular bag or cup of Ramien noodles after having this spicy brand. We have one of those hot and cold water dispensers at work and I use the hot water to fill the bowl, cover it for 5 to 7 minutes, and it's ready to eat. Are you really bold ... drink the broth afterward!! I've tried the Shin packages, the Shin bowl, the small Shin cup and the large Shin cup ... all the same great flavor, just different sizes. Of course, the package requires a bowl and a tiny bit more effort to prepare. Order it through Amazon grocery by the case for the best price or put it on your auto subscription for an even better deal. A case is usually two boxes or 12. I get a case through auto ship every 3 months, but I've also got half my family hooked on these too. Great stuff!!

review/text: Nong Shim makes the best instant noodles on the market, and of them, the Spicy Picante is my hands down favorite.  The noodles have a great testure and the broth is wonderfully spicy.  And a bowl actually satisifes as a meal, which is not something I can say about say, Oodles of Noodles.

review/text: I really am enjoying these spicy noodles and love the spicy flavor. However, I am very disappointed that you cannot microwave these (yes, I have tried and the foam almost buckled). Anyways, if you enjoy ramen that is hot you will like these. Two in a sitting is perfect.

review/summary: Reminds me of how A&W Root Beer tasted when I was a kid
review/text: The Zevia Root Beer Flavor is one of my favorites of the Zevia flavors.  It has very strong Root Beer taste which I find tastes a lot like my memories of A&W Root Beer back when I was growing up in Canada, back before they started replacing sugar with High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I'm not sure if A&W Root Beer is different here in the US from Canada, as the food in the A&W restaurants here in the US is nothing like the food in A&W Canada restaurants.<br /><br />In any case, I love that there's nothing but all natural ingredients here, and it's naturally sugar free.  This summer, I often combined the Zevia Root Beer with Clemmy's Sugar Free Vanilla Bean Ice Cream to make my own Sugar Free Root Beer Floats (and sometimes with Orange Zevia instead of the Root Beer) and they were absolutely amazing guilt free Floats.

review/summary: We examined their claims, gave it a taste-test, & found multiple problems with Zevia...But here's a solution! (Read on)
review/text: First, my household is a low-carb, low-glycemic index, and zero corn syrup household. We have been looking for alternative *natural* sweeteners for quite some time because our doctor has serious warnings (and lots of research) against chemical-based sugar substitutes like aspartame, saccharine, and splenda.<br /><br />Stevia is our favorite sweetener - usually from a bottle, or as a raw leaf. The problem is, we can find very few products (like snack bars, soda, cookies, etc) which use Stevia.<br /><br />So we were excited to meet the people from Zevia at the trade show in which they rolled out this product (2007)... and we were among the first people in the country to taste a stevia-flavored soda!<br /><br />At the trade show, the company gave out mini-cans of selected flavors, and we were super impressed. The taste is different from mainstream root beer, cola, and ginger ale products ... but it was sweet, sparkly, and had a nice bite. No awful aspartame aftertaste!<br /><br />We came home excited to order our first batch for home/personal use. To our disappointment, we found several discrepancies between their product & literature at the trade show, and the actual product rolled out.<br /><br />First, they decided to add caffeine to many of the flavors (not the root beer), but this ruined most of the flavors for us & makes their "all natural" claim a bit disingenuous.<br /><br />Next, we were told by company reps that the soda contains only purified water, stevia, and citric acid. To our surprise, when the ingredients were published on the can (FDA standards), we found that the PRIMARY sweetener is an artificial chemical called eurethrytol (2nd ingredient), not Stevia (5th ingredient). Drinking a 12 ounce can of ginger root beer flavored Zevia had the same effect on me as eating 4 maltitol-based chocolate bars (LOTS of stomach problems).<br /><br />Finally, they claim this is a zero calorie drink, but erythritol does indeed contain calories - about 25 for the can. And at $1 per can, the price is just to high. This product was a disappointment all around.<br /><br />SOLUTION!!<br /><br />Ok, so you're wanting a safe, natural, great tasting soda without side effects? All you need are 3 ingredients: Seltzer Water, Bottle of liquid Sweet Leaf Stevia, and (secret ingredient) citric acid.<br /><br />Seltzer water is widely available at any grocery store. You'll find the other two ingredients at your health food store (we buy citric acid in the bulk section of our local apothecary, under $1 per ounce).<br /><br />For one serving of soda (12 ounce) add 15-20 drops of liquid Stevia, and just a *PINCH* (1/8th teaspoon?) of citric acid. The Stevia sweetens and flavors, and makes a very nice drink. But the citric acid adds that "bite" that makes a cola taste like a cola!<br /><br />Our favorite Sweet Leaf flavors are: Root Beer, Cinnamon, Orange, & Apricot. This method is actually much cheaper than cans of Zevia, tastes better, broader variety of flavors, super portable (we travel with a little pouch of citric acid & a bottle of Sweet Leaf), and it's truly natural!<br /><br />Three more notes for health-conscious people: (1) We have tried many off-brand bottles of liquid Stevia, and they are all just fine. HOWEVER, many of the off-brands use a grain alcohol base, which tastes awful in soda (unless you're used to that sort of thing! Ha Ha...). So other brands are fine for cooking, but at this time I recommend Sweet Leaf for mixing drinks (just purified Stevia + water).<br /><br />(2) Aluminum cans are a disaster for the environment (takes one 12oz can of gasoline to melt down/recycle 4 new aluminum cans). So I recommend bottles of Seltzer water instead.<br /><br />And, (3) artificial carbonation robs your body of magnesium & other things. Instead, opt for naturally sparkling water, like Pellegrino. We usually pay $1.15 for a 1-liter bottle of naturally sparkling mineral water, no additives, and it has lots of healthy minerals. GOOD LUCK in your continued journey for better health!

review/summary: Love the Root Beer flavor
review/text: I finally found this soda at a local store. Not much on the shelf. I tried the zevia regular cola (bad aftertaste) the root beer one (this is my favorite) and the orange one (good). I didn't get the lemon/lime one. This rootbeer one is delicious. No aftertaste like the cola one has. I love rootbeer so I will continue to buy it. It is expensive at $1 a can and for the 6 pack it cost me $5.99 with no tax on it. It is a much better alternative to the diet sodas out there. I don't use artifical sweetners or have sugar in my diet except for stevia. I hope the price gets lower as other stevia colas come onto the market.

review/summary: Excellent artisan rootbeer taste!
review/text: I am currently drinking my second can of Zevia Root Beer, having managed to sneak it away from my three kids.  It's got a rich, full flavor and plenty of fizz--all our cans did.<br /><br />I left a fuller review on their Cola entry, but everything I said there stands for this variety, as well.  It's just as good as either sugar-full or sugar-free brands, but is not bad for you, and even good for you because of the stevia, which can help regulate blood sugar.<br /><br />Makes a killer float, too, with my own homemade sugar-free artificial sweetener-free ice cream.

review/summary: Natural Ginger Root Beer with stevia tastes great
review/text: When I found out about this product from Jorge Cruise's site, I couldn't wait to try it.  It took many visits to specialty stores (names obtained from the Zevia website) before I finally found one that had just two cans of the Ginger Root Beer in stock.  I bought both cans, even though I never really drink root beer.  After tasting Zevia Ginger Root Beer, I love root beer now!  This is my favorite flavor, even over Cola and Orange (haven't had the Twist, yet).<br /><br />Everything in the Ginger Root Beer is natural, and there's no caffeine (like the Cola, even though it's supposed to be natural caffeine). The cola is  my next favorite that I have occasionally.  I did not care much for the orange, it tasted artificial and not very orangy-tasting. I highly recommend the root beer flavor, though.

review/summary: The best Zevia flavor
review/text: My wife and I have tried the four flavors of Zevia and we both have this as our favorite.  Using Stevia instead of sugar or the common sugar substitutes is great.  The price is OK.  It would be nice if Amazon could make a deal with Zevia to offer "FREE with Super Saver Shipping" in the future.  At this time the $9.89 shipping makes the price less attractive.<br /><br />When we drink "traditional" soft drinks we mostly drink diet drinks.  We get Diet Dr. Pepper and Diet Pepsi (when available at places like restaurants) as first choices.  I tolerate Diet Coke when I want a diet soft drink at a restaurant and none of the above are available.  Although, I may also get a non-diet soft drink if that is the case.  I included some of the other drinks we like, since taste is subjective.  Hopefully if you like the above drinks, Zevia's Root Beer may be to your liking.

review/summary: It's ok
review/text: I've been trying to give up all diet sodas containing aspartame and splenda because of all the online research I've been doing on those sweeteners.<br /><br />This root beer is the first Zevia product I have tasted.<br /><br />It doesn't have a very strong root beer flavor -  more like a mix of root beer and ginger ale - to it and it tasted a little flat.<br /><br />For me, the flavor is just ok.  My root beer happy 8 year old didn't like it at all.
