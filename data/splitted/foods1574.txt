review/text: I purchased these k-cups a few weeks ago, and now I am hooked. I must have one every day. I am not a coffee drinker, but an avid tea drinker. From time to time, I try different k-cups. This vanilla is smooth tasting, creamy, yet not too sweet. If you are not into coffee, this will be a pleasant surprise. It has a little coffee in it.

review/summary: A little pricey but very good gum
review/text: This is the best gum I've found since Hershey discontinued their Koolerz brand several years ago.  (This stuff is also made by Hershey).<br /><br />Both the Spearmint and Peppermint flavors have a nicely combined minty sweetness that lingers for quite a while.  The texture stays "chewably soft" for even longer.  Another thing I really like about this gum, unlink others I've tried, is it doesn't stick to my fillings or crowns and I don't wind up with little pieces between my teeth.<br /><br />The only problem is the investment to get your first sample.  If you can find it in a store, it's not everywhere, one of these packs costs over a dime a piece.  It can be less, per piece, here but buying multiple "tubs" (designed to fit in a car cup holder) is a bit if a gamble if you've never tried it.<br /><br />It's great gum and you will probably like it if you like gum.  I was lucky and sat next to a guy in a plane who offered me some.  And, if you should run into me, ask for some because I'll be having some on hand from now on.

I'm not a tea expert, but this tea is really delicious! Whether you add milk (I usually add soy milk) or just water, this become a truly refreshing treat that is not too sweet. I recommend buying just one box of this item before buying the four-box-pack that comes from Amazon. If you do decide that you like it, then committing to the four boxes won't be hard! I'm about to run out of supply, so I will be ordering another four boxes soon hehe

But none of them could tell me if any store local to me sells it. So here I am buying it here- a little bit more expensive but not much. I have sprinkled this green tea powder over vanilla icecream, used it in smoothies, made iced and hot tea with it. I've made pitchers of tea with it and my quests loved it. It's good and good for you. I've also used the unsweetened style but prefer this lightly sweetened version. It is not sickening sweet either.

review/summary: My bullies love them!
review/text: My bull terriers can't get enough of these chews! I have searched high and low for the perfect chew - one that lasts and also one that is safe. I have spent a fortune on chews and the "stuffed" hooves are the best, also smoked knee bones are excellent.<br /><br />I have never had the hooves splinter or cause any safety problems.  This may be a potential problem with really large dogs who can really get their jaws around the hoof and crunch it maybe...so far no problems with my bullies.<br /><br />The natural "stuffing" is all the dried flesh and bones attached to the hoof that most brands remove, this is the best part for my pooches. They absolutely love getting all the stuff out of the hoof...takes a lot of time and distracts them for hours.<br /><br />Also, all of the other "chew-hooves" I have bought have a HORRIBLE death-cow-poo smell which made me want to vomit if my dog was chewing them around me. For some reason, this brand just kind of has a mild, smoked-meat smell. No rotten, nasty smell with these.<br /><br />i would definitely supervise a dog with one of these for the first time, since you never know how they will do with a new chewie.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: Worth their weight in gold
review/text: This is the only thing available that will last for days with my big obnoxious destructive dogs. After they have torn it apart (which takes hours) they enjoy the hooves for weeks. They go crazy for them, and spend several peaceful hours quietly chewing - mommy gets much needed quiet time. Totally safe, my 3 dogs are different sizes and have no problems or safety issues with the foot bones inside the hooves (they are round bones with no sharp edges - think knuckles). I've just bought a second batch of these, they are my first choice for a long lasting chew. I've gotten them years before and they have always been safe, good for any size dog, mine are medium and large mutts, but fine for little ones too - would last them for a month. WAY cheaper on here than in a TSC where they are over $5 each - and even that is a bargain compared to any other natural chewy available. Safer than rawhide because they won't get blocked up, and it is not so hard that it will hurt their teeth, as the hoof is like a nail, not like a bone. You'll want to put them outside with this goody, or put them on a sheet, can get messy.

review/summary: Highly recommended.
review/text: My 25 lb basenji loves this! He bores easily and doesn't take to anything for long -- toys, chews, all dead to him after 30 minutes max. But I've given him this hoof for an hour every couple days for two weeks, and he still gets excited every time. He dug out the insides the first time around, then went to gnawing on the hooves for several rounds. Now he's working on the "skin", but thankfully spitting out any chunks he manages to tear off. It's like 3 treats in one, and he's enjoying every part. I supervise him closely and have had no issues at all. Being a smaller dog, the size of the hoof alone prevents him crushing it to pieces. And, as others mentioned, there is no odor and little to no cleanup required afterwards. Pretty much a perfect treat for my dog; relatively inexpensive, long-lasting, no smell/cleanup, and keeps him independently entertained longer than anything I've tried so far (and I've tried lots).

review/summary: Dangerous item
review/text: I can't believe a positive review of this item exists!  We got one of these for our dog when the store was out of Merrick's "The Sarge" beef bones.  It was terrible.<br /><br />Our dog is a big, healthy, tough Labrador and loves her "Sarge" bones.  After chewing on the "Twin Hoofers" for just about 20 minutes, I noticed that they were coming apart into large, sharp pieces.  The women at the shop had said dogs can digest every part of the hooves, but I took them away because I wasn't comfortable with what was happening.<br /><br />By the next day, our dog was having horrible diarrhea and there were pieces of the hoof in it.  The morning after that, she vomited up several large, jagged pieces and then had so much blood in her stool that my boyfriend and I considered taking her to the vet.  We're waiting to see if she recovers on her own.<br /><br />Apparently, some dogs can handle it, but why take the chance that yours will have as much trouble as ours did?

review/summary: Dog LOVES this but surprisingly doesn't last
review/text: I just bought this for my dog today, it's been about 3-4 hours and he already has it split in half with just the hooves left. He's a 1 year old 50 pound border collie that LOVES to chew so I was hoping this would last at least a few days but it doesn't seem that way. He absolutely LOVES this, however, since he can go through it within about 5-6 hours I'm giving it a 4 star. Its' definitely durable, he's just VERY aggressive with his chewing. He's still going through his puppy chewing phase so I'm hoping once he's two years he'll calm down with the chewing and I can buy him stuff that will last past a day!<br /><br />EDIT: So I was wrong, it did last a few days. He broke the whole thing down to just the bottom part in a day and then munched on the rest of it for a few days. However, there was a problem unfortunately. He vomited shards of the hoof twice and had blood in his stool. The blood in his stool only happened once so luckily he ended up being fine. I supervised him eating this and didn't notice this breaking up into shards, I must have just missed it. I know someone else who reviewed this had the same thing happen so just watch very closely before giving this to your dog. He absolutely LOVED this and I'm sad he can't have it anymore.

review/summary: May need to monitor
review/text: I purchased one of these hoofers at my local PetCo and my small 16lb mixed breed loves it. The "Hoofer" is the whole hoof of a bovine, the toes with the bones and meat and skin all there. It is dried and not cured, which I am really pleased with. Because it is the whole foot I wouldn't recommend this for dogs that like to swallow large pieces off of their chews. For my small dog it is great!<br /><br />It doesn't smell bad like sometimes just the clipped hoof can, and infact even when my dog has been chewing on it for a long session I don't notice it being smelly. I've had rawhides after being chewed smell pretty bad (from the curing chemicals I guess?) but this hoofer doesn't smell gross. Even though it has more stuff in it than just a rawhide it doesn't get super stinky, a big plus for our apartment since we can't leave chews outside.<br /><br />Over all I recommend this hoofer as a good alternative to rawhides. If you have a big dog you may want to monitor them since it does have the toe bones inside and there are many and they are small.<br /><br />My dog hasn't splintered anything on this but again he is only 16lbs and is not a "power chewer", the red kongs are just fine for him. I would monitor closely if your dog is a "power chewer" just to be safe, but my dog is still working on this after month and there aren't any cracks in the karatin.

review/text: I was optimistic about the flavor, based on the yummy soy sauce and sesame aroma coming from the finished product. But the taste... oh man, the taste. It tasted like pure vinegar. The sauce was SO SOUR. The acidity overpowered any soy or sesame flavor by a long shot. The only thing I can think is that in order to compensate for the dish being lower sodium than most noodle bowl type things, they tried to ramp up the flavor with acidic ingredients. A touch of acidity does help bring out the flavor when you reduce the salt, but this was WAY too much.

review/summary: These noodles are great, but not from Amazon.
review/text: I've had these noodles many, many times. From grocery stores, and even a small convenience store on my college campus. They are always SUPERB- some of the best microwavable cuisine I've eaten. The noodles are soft, the sauce is like a syrup, and the flavor is just unbelievable.<br /><br />Not from amazon. I purchased these noodles with high hopes. I've ordered food items before from Amazon and NEVER have they arrived to my satisfaction or expectations. With these, I figured- "Hey, how could they possibly screw up vacuum sealed microwavable noodles?" I still couldn't tell you how, but it definitely happened.<br /><br />The noodles were clumpy, and broke even after microwaving , even if a small bit of water was added- nothing. There was no life to them, and when your noodles are off- it's tough to enjoy a noodle dish. If that had been the end of it, though, I still would have tolerated the rest of my 6-pack, if vowing to never order them from Amazon again. But no, somehow the SAUCE managed to be terrible in this product! Rather than the viscous syrup-texture of the store-bought Annie Chun's, the packet included in this item was watery with clumps. The sauce itself was watery, yet the "clumps" were all the more noticable for lack of syrup around them. These "clumps" that do not exist in the grocery-store version refused to leave the packet without me opening it up and adding water, swirling, and then dumping out whatever one would call the ungodly mixture I had at that point.<br /><br />Even still- I had hope for the finished product. Surely Annie will pull through for me, regardless of where I got this particular package from! No. What emerged from my microwave took me by complete surprise. In sharp contrast to the delicious noodles resulting from the store-bought Annie Chun's was what can only be described as a disaster. The noodles, already rubbery rather than soft- dried and shriveled over their 60 seconds in the microwave. The sauce, rather than permeating through the noodles as it usually does- had slipped past and collected in a small pool at the bottom of the container. Vegetable chunks and the mysterious "clumps" shriveled and died as well, without the sauce buoying their transformation from freeze-dried to fresh.<br /><br />Three trials later, modifying this and that part of the instructions: soaking the noodles in warm water first, including water in the container before microwaving, mixing a bit of water and corn starch into the sauce, none of this could save what Amazon shipped to me as "Annie Chun's Chinese Chow Mein" noodles. In the end, I decided against leaving the remaining two bowls in the common room for "someone" to eat. I wouldn't want to turn them off this great product just because I made the mistake of ordering food off of Amazon. Instead, they made their way to the trash, where they belonged.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, this isn't the first time I've ordered food off of amazon- Emerald Nuts that were "off", peanut butter that was "strange", a pack of 6 jars of Nutella one of which was opened, another of which was just "different". Scooby-Doo gummies that arrived with a crusty/crunchy exterior, and now this pack of noodles. It's not the first time, but I can safely say that it will be the last. Amazon's cheap prices are great for some things, but for groceries- it's just not worth it to this buyer any longer.

review/summary: Noodles were OK, sauce was not good at all
review/text: Echoing what some of the other reviewers mentioned, the sauce with this product has a very strong vinger taste/smell.  I used less than half of the sauce packet and it still felt that way.  The noodles themselves were OK, however without a good sauce to go with them, its really a moot point.  I don't recommend this product.

review/summary: Not Worth the Calories
review/text: I've had chow mein before and this is not it.  The noodles are Ok although they have a weird texture but like another reviewer said, you have to heat them up first because they're packed together pretty tight. Even after I microwaved according to the package directions, I still had a hard time breaking the noodles up to get everything mixed together.  The worst part is the sauce.  It tasted like watered down soy sauce and there was a very unpleasant tangy after taste.  Yuck!  I'm not sure who taste tested these but they need to go back to the drawing board. You can find a much tastier meal than this for 320 calories.

review/summary: 14-year old son likes them for his school lunch
review/text: Son has a fairly sensitive and educated palate, and he gives these noodles the nod.  Usually make him sandwiches of various sorts, but occasionally take a day off and toss a pre-packaged item in the lunch pail.  If the information on the package is real, these are decent food in eco friendly packages.  Decent price through 6-pack from AMZ.

review/summary: Not so good
review/text: I have had the Annie Chun's Noodle Bowls before (the bowls, not the trays that the Noodle Express line uses) and like those a lot. For those, you actually add water and steam the fresh packed noodles, then drain them before you add the sauce. When I read the microwave instructions for this particular product, I almost thought they messed up and left out the part of adding water to the noodles! But since I had never had these before, I decided to just follow the directions and see how it turned out. Well, it turned out bad, heh. The noodles aren't really conducive to breaking apart *before* microwaving them (unless you like your noodles in tiny little pieces), and it's almost impossible to evenly distribute the sauce on the noodles before microwaving, so half the noodles were dry and packed together, whereas the other half had a good texture, but were completely saturated in the sauce (which was a little strong for my taste anyways). Plus, the dried vegetables from the little packet didn't get reconstituted so they were almost too hard to chew. I happened to buy 2 of these products at the same time, so I'm going to try steaming the noodles with water when I have the next one...otherwise, I would never give these another chance!<br /><br />***Edited to add - June 8, 2009***<br />I tried steaming the noodles and veggie packet (added warm water to about 1/3 of the way up the tray, microwaved for 1 min), drained the noodles, added the sauce packet then nuked for another 30 seconds and it came out immensely better. The sauce flavor is still a bit intense (I tried the Teryaki version this time) but all-in-all, the product is better than I first thought. If only they would put the correct cooking directions on the box!!

review/text: I love this brand!  We have bought the plain applesauce in the past, and decided to try the cinnamon.  I use it in the kids' lunches and they love this flavor as well!  I like the individual serving cups, although it would be nice if they were made of #1 or #2 plastic so they could be recycled in my area.  The foil lids are a bit difficult for younger children to remove.  Overall it's a good value and is convenient to use.

review/summary: These are gross!
review/text: My children love applesauce.  I run an in-home daycare and purchased a case of the cinnamon Earth's Best applesauce cups.  Not one of my kids ate them.  What a waste!  After they all left the cups barely touched, I tasted the applesauce myself and it tasted sour.  The cinnamon was very faint and while every other brand of applesauce I have ever personally tried that is naturally sweetened, this brand did not have a bit of sweetness to it.  (We're talking ripe, tasty apples not High Fructose Corn Syrup sweet here).  I'll keep buying the packs at Trader Joe's - my kids love those and the price isn't that different.  Save your money, go with a different brand....

review/text: Just wanted to say that my son was premature and had severe reflux and allergies to the milk protein.  This formula was better than any other, even the Neocate.  Just a side note, the liquid formula IS different than the powder.  The liquid formula doesn't contain corn solids and the powder does.  I had my son on the powder and he would arch and pull away after two ounces (his twin sister could take about 5-6 ounces at this point and his weight was much less than hers).  I switched to the liquid and he sucked it down like he hadn't eaten in months.  It's very expensive but totally worth it in our circumstance!  The only reason it doesn't get five stars is b/c, yes, it has a horrible smell... but he likes it so I don't really care what it smells like!

review/text: My son (who is 7 months old now) has been on this formula since he was 2 months old..it was a lifesaver for us! He had colic and acid reflux. The first 2 months of his life were hard. He screamed almost constantly and my husband and I were so desperate to help our little guy feel better. Finally, our pediatrician recommended this over the phone. We braved a snowstorm to run to the store and buy this expensive formula. It took a couple of weeks but we did finally notice a difference! We found this product on Amazon and immediately signed up for Amazon prime to have this delivered straight to our door with 2 day shipping. Imagine my surprise when I went to order it today and the price has gone from $53.94 for 6 bottles to $61.20! It is no longer cheaper to purchase here on Amazon. It now equals about $10.20 a bottle and we can get it at our local large chain grocery store for around $9/bottle plus we can use coupons that Similac sends us! Very disappointed..we loved the ease of ordering through Amazon while also saving money. We've also found it cheaper to buy diapers at the store with coupons as well. Sad day for my family when Amazon lets us down!!

review/summary: PLEASE READ: This liquid is different than the powder form!
review/text: My son was having so many problems with food, we were going to a few different doctors and unfortunately had to keep switching his formula (not by choice, trust me!) I had to stop the breast milk even because he just was not tolerating the milk protein or really much of anything.  I have a super bad stomach and I was so worried I had passed it on to my son even at one month of age.  Our pediatrician gave us a container of the similac alimentum powder form and it did make a small difference however my son was still crying like he was in pain after each bottle.  I read a lot of reviews online and noticed a few people mentioning that their child could tolerate the liquid form over the powder form.  My doc knew nothing of this and i was so discouraged but figured I would give it a try.  Not joking, the first bottle of the liquid form he ate, no crying after.  I cried because I was so happy to not have my son in pain after eating for the first time.  At one point I was up north and ran out of the liquid so I HAD to give him the powder and sure enough, crying and pain immediately after.  My son is now almost 6 months old and has not had one single problem and is the happiest baby on the planet all day long now.  PLEASE spend the ridiculous amount of money for this formula because I KNOW first hand how  miserable life can be when your baby is in pain and you don't know how to stop it.  The powder form does have a corn ingredient in it that the liquid form does not have, please give it a try so you and your child will be pain free.  If it works as it did for me, you really should let others know because it is such a helpless feeling to have to go through.  Good luck!!

review/summary: Great for milk protien allergy
review/text: My daughter has a milk protein allergy and we had to switch to this formula. It's been great so far. Yes, it is more expensive than all the other formula, but there are not a lot of options if your child is allergic to cow's milk. Right now the formula is on sale (about $6.50 per bottle vs. $9 per bottle). I think it is due to the Similac recall that everything is on sale. I would stock up now if you are able! We have tried the powder version and to be honest it smells disgusting. It makes me want to vomit although the baby does not seem to care. I just can't handle it and we only use it when we are out of the house and can't keep a cold bottle with us.

review/summary: Great Product --- BUT BEWARE OF ORDERING THRU AMAZON!
review/text: We struggled to find a formula that would not upset our newborn's stomach.  He would grunt and squeal with stomach issues throughout the day.  We tried Sensitive and Soy... nothing really worked.  This finally did the trick.  We didn't encounter any issues with him rejecting it because of taste.  Although I will say that it smells a little more than the other versions of formula.<br /><br />One thing to beware of - Amazon offered this product through AMAZON PRIME and I ordered it.  They have yet to fulfill the order (almost a month later).  There are numerous vendors who are selling this on Amazon and I have had fast shipping through all of them.  For some reason Amazon just keeps stalling on shipping this product and does not give any reason when asked.  I've never had this issue with Amazon before and I am completely surprised.  The only reason I can think of is that Amazon offered it at a cheaper price and then afterwards decided they did not want to honor the cheaper price.

review/summary: Price increase..cheaper at local stores
review/text: My son (who is 8 months old now) has been on this formula since he was 3 months old! He had acid reflux. We found this product on Amazon and immediately signed up for Amazon prime to have this delivered straight to our door with 2 day shipping. However the price has gone from $53.94 for 6 bottles to $60! It is no longer cheaper to purchase here on Amazon. It now equals about $10 a bottle and we can get it at our local large chain grocery store for around $9/bottle plus we can use coupons that Similac sends us! Very disappointed..we loved the ease of ordering through Amazon while also saving money. Sad day for my family when Amazon lets us down!!

review/summary: great for babies with milk protein allergy
review/text: We switched our baby boy from the regular similac to this after we saw bloody stool. It is more expensive than other types of formula, but the blood cleared within two weeks like the pedi said, so it was well worth it. Our son also had reflux but this formula did not seem to help any. FYI for anyone wondering if this is cheaper than the powder- yes, it is. However, if your baby eats 32oz a day, you're basically saving $0.80 (yes, cents!) a day using powder($162.79 for six 1lb cans) vs Ready to Feed ($53.94 for six 32oz bottles). IMO I'd rather pay the $0.80 and not have to mix the stuff myself.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: Our son had very very bad congestion until he started on Alimentum and now it is completely gone and we are so relieved.  We used to hear him wheezing all night long and worry all the time about him.  Now he can finally breath.  It took about 8 days for us to see results.  We couldn't get him to take any of the other hypoallergenic formulas - he would gag and throw them up but he liked this one right away.  Our only complaint is the price!  We wish it wasn't so expensive.  But it's well worth it.

review/summary: Baby Likes It!
review/text: My baby was breastfed for several months, but I decided to wean her because I was exclusively pumping. She has a milk protein allergy so we were limited to the type of formula we could give her. We tried the Alimentum and Nutramigen powder and she hated both of them and cried, spit, and choked through a bottle if there was one ounce of either of them in it. I tried the ready to feed after I read that it didn't have corn in it and the first time I gave it to her, it she drank it without an issue. Some reviewers talked about the smell, which hasn't been an issue. I think it smells fine. It is expensive, but we are able to submit the cost difference between this and regular formula for reimbursement through our health care flex spending account.

review/summary: The best formula for reflux!
review/text: After 4 months of screaming, spit up and extreme reflux-- AND 9 formulas later-- we finally found our solution!  Alimentum ready to feed was a life saver!  My baby tolerates this forula VERY well!  There's still some spit up, but it's not projectile.  And, he doesn't cry while eating.  It digests very well too!  Yes, in the beginning we did notice it had a slightly different smell from other formulas, but we got used to it quickly.  And, I don't think it's nearly as bad as many say it is.  Plus, how can you complain about smell when this formula is clearly the only one on the market that works for reflux babies or allergic babies?!?!  This saved our son and our sanity!  Great price on Amazon too!  Oh, and insurance will pay for it if you work with your doctor and insurance company.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!  So grateful it exists.

review/summary: Too Expensive & Little Help From Abbott
review/text: Excellent formula for babies with protein allergies like ours. She must be on this premixed version formula but at about $10/bottle at most retailers (Walmart has it for $6.97 but doesn't always have it in stock), the cost is WAY too high. Insurance won't help, don't qualify for WIC, and when we called Similac to try to get more coupons (already a strongmoms member but coupons decreased from about 4 to 1), they were not cooperative but offered to send a powder sample. Amazon's price wih subscription is excellent, and only .64 cents more than Walmart which is a nightmare to visit and wait on line!!!! With free shipping and Amazons trustworthiness and service, Im glad to pay a little extra to get it shipped right to home! Yay!!! No Walmartians to battle!!!!!

review/text: Our baby handles this better than any other formula we've tried.  Very little gas and spitups, plus she's growing like a weed.  Her acid reflux went away, she sleeps better, its great.<br /><br />My complaint - this stuff should not cost as much as it does.  Its a scam that they jack the price of the only formula that works for certain children, knowing parents who have no choice will have to pay for it.  Its costing us nearly $500 a month for this stuff.  The businessmen at Abbott Labs who decided to profit off children with special dietary needs should be ashamed.  I'm *certain* it can't cost twice the price to manufacture this.

review/summary: Great Product!!!
review/text: I agree wholeheartedly with some of the recent reviews below.  My son has a dairy intolerance and I had to stop breastfeeding when he was 4.5 months old.  This product was a lifesaver!!  He drinks it happily, and his symptoms, since switching to Alimentum, have subsided (knock on wood).<br /><br />That said, beware of ordering through Amazon. I ordered several cases for my baby through Amazon Prime almost one month ago & have received multiple emails telling me that the product is unavailable for shipment. Meanwhile, several vendors list the product as available on Amazon (including Amazon's subsidiary, Diapers.com). I've contacted customer service several times, but have continued to get the runaround.  I suspect that this has to do with an attempt to avoid honoring the lower list price (the Amazon prices drastically increased recently).  It's a sad sad day when Amazon disappoints.  Notably, when I've ordered the full price product through Diapers.com, it's arrived the next day.<br /><br />In any event, the formula itself has been great!

review/summary: Great Stuff - really helped w/ Fussiness
review/text: Our little man was extremely fussy - our Ped's Dr. thought it might be a milk & soy allergy, & recommended this formula. Within a few days, the hours upon hours of fussiness ended & turned into 20 minutes here & there.  He got so good we thought, "maybe he's not really allergic to soy" - so we tried a dfferent (and less expensive forumla) - mistake - we're back on the Alimentum & the little man is back to his low state of fussiness.  He's also put on quite a bit of weight, seems generally less constipated, & has less spit up.  I think we're hooked.

I hate having to mix the powder so we use the ready to feed and it's fantastic. We just use a sharpie to mark when we opened it so that we can keep track of the 48 hour limit. I also love that the top has a mechanism to help with opening the foil top.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish it were available through subscribe-and-save through Amazon; I have to remember to re-order every two weeks.

review/text: My 2 month old began having screaming and constipation problems while I was using the orange similac powder.  We decided to switch him to the blue similac powder, nothing changed.  We even had abd x-ray done since the constipation continued to last for 7 days at a time each time, all normal.  After reading I found alot of the reviews were saying powder was different from the ready to feed.  We switched to this and within 12 hours had a pooping nonscreaming baby.  He was happy and not crying or pulling legs up constantly.  The ingredients in powder are different then the ready to feed.  Definetly worth the extra money to make our baby feel well.

review/summary: This formula is a Godsend!
review/text: My daughter has reflux and many, many food allergies. We've tried so many different formulas and this is the ONLY formula that works for her corn allergy. The powdered version contains corn (not much, but it does contain some) the ready to feed one (this one) contains none. She no longer screams when she eats and poops and her tummy is doing so much better! This is truly a formula for the most sensitive of tummies. If a sensitive formula like Nutramigen or Elecare didn't work for your baby, I would suggest trying this one. Hopefully it'll work for your baby, too!

review/summary: Happy in a Can!
review/text: Works awesome for milk-soy-corn allergy in my 4 month old son.  But did take a while to notice a difference:  5 days until colic started to disappear, 2 weeks before eczema started to improve, 2 weeks for blood to be completely eliminated from stool samples given to dr's office.  It does make him more gassy and his poop does smell horrible now, but overall he is so much happier!! :)  And the blood is gone, so that is great.  One downfall is that it is soooo expensive!!!  About $70/week and my insurance will not cover it unless he has a positive blood allergy test, which he doesn't, as the tests aren't accurate in babies so young.  And even with coverage, they would only cover 50% through a medical supply company which charges 3x as much as you can buy it at the store.  So yes, insurance coverage is a pain, worth a try though if your child needs to be on this formula.  Would try Nutramigen first to see if that works, as it's a lot cheaper.... my son had an allergic reaction to it (hives, blood in stool, colic, swelling, etc), due to the high corn syrup solid content and had to change to a corn-free formula. This is the only corn-free formula that you can buy at the store.

review/summary: Not what I had expected.
review/text: We got this formula for our 2.5 month-old boy.  He has been fussy and gassy, although his milk consumption is about 40% formula and 60% breast milk.  We were hoping this would be the solution, as sometimes he cries out in obvious pain before passing incredible amounts of gas.  It is heartbreaking.<br /><br />We immediately tried this as soon as it arrived, and it seemed like it was easier for him to pass, but then he had diarrhea that smelled terrible.  No wonder!  The product is completely foul smelling, and I tasted it and it is probably the WORST thing I have tasted in my LIFE.  I read reviews about it, and believe me, they are NOT exaggerating.<br /><br />After three days of using this formula, my son completely rejected it and chose starvation over this formula.  We had to go back to our previous formula, Similac Sensitive for fussiness and gas, which after three days of Alimentum really didn't seem to cause him much more difficulty than the Alimentum.<br /><br />We thought maybe it would help with the gassiness, but honestly, it is so terrible that I really wouldn't recommend it unless your child has an actual milk allergy and really needs it.  It smells and tastes terrible and is on the expensive side because of the processing required.

review/text: As others have noted, this stuff does seriously reek, even more than the other formulas made from dying cattle.  It does, however, stay down better than the powdered products, even the powdered Alimentum, perhaps because it's thicker.  If circumstances leave you no alternative but to supplement your baby with formula, the ready-to-feed products are handier and perhaps better-tolerated until you can get your baby onto fruits, vegetables, and grains.  If your baby tolerates the RTF soy formula, that's an obvious better choice than this stuff.

review/summary: We love it - safe rawhide that lasts!
review/text: This thing is HUGE and my Great Dane absolutely adores it! I purchased 2 chews, a knotted one and this braided one, and I must say that I am very happy. That's saying a lot because I usually hate rawhide -- my dog normally devours most rawhide treats in about 15 minutes and during that time manages to tear off at least one soft wet chunk big enough to choke on and scare the daylights out of me. These are designed in a way those scary moments haven't happened!<br />These chews are truly CHUNKY - the ring is easily over 8 inches diameter and the braid is about 3 inches across, the rawhide is super thick and the whole thing is HEAVY. The braided design makes it so he cannot pull large pieces off to choke on and he has to work very hard to get even small pieces off. Normally if he has to work hard at a chew he will just give up - but not these! He carries it all over the house, plays with it by throwing it in the air (which is very loud on my wood floor), and then settles down for some chewing time -- this chew keeps him entertained for a good hour or more. In this hour of chewing he does NOT devour the rawhide like many other brands we have tried, he just barely manages to get a small 4 inch section gnawed soft then gets tired and takes a nap.  In 3 days he has not gotten bored with this routine and we still have 98% of the original chew left! To me - that is a cost effective chew toy! He seems to prefer this braided ring over the knotted type - maybe because the circle design enables him to hold the chew firmly with his paws (see picture) or maybe because of the tasty beef basting. Even more impressive is that the basting looks to be thoroughly embedded into and throughout all of the rawhide not just brushed on the outside; it does not come off on his white legs or my beige carpet - how WONDERFUL is that?!<br />I feel it is important to note that these are all-natural rawhide chews MADE IN THE USA (Illinois). They do say "a product of Brazil" on the outside of the package because they are made from free range, natural grass-fed BRAZILIAN beef hides (without chemicals, preservatives or bleaches). They are also antibiotic, hormone and preservative free. All of their rawhide products are lot-coded for traceability back to the cow. They are a PetAg product (a USA company founded in 1930) which is a division of Borden (another USA company).<br /><br />So in closing: They might seem a bit expensive at first glance, but I have discovered they are high quality, long lasting, and dog entertaining... that to me is worth every penny and if my dog ever makes it through the 2 chews I we already have -- I will happily purchase more!

review/summary: Pretty good rawhide...
review/text: My lab is just turning 1 yr old and we have decided to try him on rawhide's. You shouldn't just use any rawhide, certain rawhides will break off in large pieces which is very dangerous to the dog or the dog could get a upset tummy from cheaper brands. Im pleased to say none of this happened to my lab with this ring or the Chunky Chew brand for that matter! It has been fantastic so far and he has loved every minute of it.<br /><br />I only knock this down a star because of the price, nothing else. The rawhide lasted 8-10 hours with my dog, your dog may vary, i only gave it to him for 1 hr stints. I have found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013APAWE">10 Premium Pressed Rawhide Bones treats 12"</a> lasted around the same amount of time for 1/3 of the price per bone. The quality build was the same if not better, and the dog loved it as well. So going forward i will be buying the 12 inch bone instead, just because i can get 3 for the price of 1 ring (as of this writing).

We had to cut up the first one, and let our 4-year old shelter boy have a piece at a time as he is not familiar with toys or treats.  It took over a month for him to finally finish it. It is great because it doesn't leave greasy residue or discoloration on carpet or flooring. He carries the new one everywhere, but the chewing hasn't started yet.  We are very pleased with this product and will continue buying them.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I bought this rawhide for my english bulldog who loves to chew.  I was very hesitant about rawhides with a previous bulldog due to the fact that pieces can be bitten off and choked on.  This bulldog is a chewer and I need to have something for him to chew on.  I only allow him to have rawhides when I am here to watch him.  He had this rawhide for 10 minutes and already had a piece big enough to choke on in his mouth and I had to dig it out.  I have given it to him 3 different times for about 10-15 minutes and he already had more than half of it gone.  I was hoping based on reviews that this would last longer than this.  The positive is he does love it and it seems to curb his chewing, but I just wished it would last longer than this.

review/summary: Best Chew EVER
review/text: I have a 55lb Boxer Mix, almost 5 years old.  He is a voracious chewer, and I usually get him moo tubes, or curly chews, or braided bully sticks.  They all last a day, maybe two.  I decided to try this chew based on the reviews I read here.  This IS the real thing.  My dog has been chewing this chew for the past week.  He carries it around the house, and there is just a little less than half of it left.  I am back to buy another one.  There is no scent, and no mess.  If you have a strong chewer, try this.  Really.

review/summary: Hallelujah - my prayers have been answered!
review/text: I have an 8 month old, 85lb pure bred German Shepherd that is an insanely strong chewer.  Both Amazon and the pet supply industry have made a killing off me as I have bought nearly every chewable product out there from stuffed animals to elk antlers.<br /><br />Until now, nothing has met my big four criteria:<br /><br />1) Taste - obviously, otherwise the dog wouldn't touch it<br />2) Durable - it needs to last longer than an hour<br />3) Clean - femur bones are great if you are ok with a chipped tooth and picking blood/marrow chunks out of the carpet<br />4) Cost - I refuse to buy expensive bully sticks at $12/stick when they last 10min<br /><br />My dog loves this ring - he lies down, puts one arm through the center to stabilize it and then has at it.  It's important to note that it makes him use all his teeth.  The ring design throws him off and he's got to strategize a bit.  At first, he uses his front teeth to pick away at it and then he uses his chompers once he's cut through a section.<br /><br />I bought this thing last week and he has only made it half way through.  Case in point.  This thing is great - buy it...do it now!

review/text: Product did not hold up well! My rottweiler and pitbull had these chewed in two within a few hours. Eaten within the first day. Enjoyed the rawhide while it lasted, just did not last very long!

review/summary: Lasts a Long Time with Strong Chewer
review/text: Our big Ridgeback loves his bully sticks and rawhide chews, but they last about 15 minutes. This is the only chew we've found that lasts--and it lasts WEEKS. It takes him about a week to chew through the ring, and then at least a couple more weeks to finish the rest. It's very, very thick and so it's a lot safer than unbraided or narrower rawhide. The taste must also be great, because we've tried other brands of thickly braided rawhide sticks (even the basted ones) and an expensive elk antler, but he isn't interested in them after a couple minutes. If you have a very large dog or just an assertive chewer, this is a "Best Buy"!

review/summary: The Beast Approves.
review/text: My two year old lab/boxer mix is 45lbs and typically a little beast when it comes to his toys and treats. It took him approximately 6 hours to gnaw through 60% of this rawhide ring and 3 hours for the remainder portion. I was hoping it'd last longer given the price and size but he loved it so I'll definitely buy it for special occasions.

review/text: My pit mix carried the chew around for four hours before she started working on it.  By the end of the day she had eaten about 1/3.  She really seems to like it.  I suspect the entire thing will be gone by tomorrow.

review/summary: AMAZING purchase, we are so HAPPY!!
review/text: Mine came in the classic raw hide color the ecru/off white color which didn't really bother me but i thought i should mention it since the picture shows a brown color one.<br /><br />It is HUGE and it is made for chewers!!<br /><br />I am so impressed with this because I've had it for about 2 weeks now and my 7 month old Labrador Retriever (which can pretty much chew through anything) finally managed last night to cut off a chunk and made it look like a smiley face now..:)<br /><br />I would definitely buy this again and i am already recommending to many of my friends.<br /><br />This definitely is a winner!

review/summary: One ring to almost rule all dogs.
review/text: After hearing that beef bones are bad for dogs (splinters and such), I started searching for a safer alternative for my german shepard Wiz.<br />Previous good reviews convinced me this braided rawhide ring was suitable.<br /><br />Wiz was ecstatic (as he always is whenever he gets something from Amazon). He pranced around happily, showing off his new toy.<br />After an hour, he ripped out a chunk of the ring. After a week, the ring pretty much disintegrated.<br /><br />Price and durability knocked this product down for me, but Wiz was satisfied.<br />Not recommended for real HEAVY-DUTY chewer.

review/summary: BIG chewstick for dogs that love to chew!
review/text: I got this for my Standard Poodle who loves chewsticks and finishes them way too fast.  He was so excited when I gave this to him!  This is a BIG and heavy chewstick, meant for big dogs.  My favorite thing about it is that is doesn't leave nasty stains and dried up "goo" on my furniture.  My dog has had it for 3 days now and he's got about 1/3 of it left.  He's kind of obsessive about it and has been working hard on it, so I'm pleased that there is still this much left.  I'd say the only bad thing about it is that he loves it so much, he's guarding it.  If my Pug walks by the bone, he gets "yelled" at for being too close!  I will definitely treat him with these every month or so.  Definitely worth the money!

review/summary: Love this rawhide!
review/text: I bought this for my Siberian Husky, who is a heavy chewer.  It has been very well tolerated by her and doesn't come off in chunks.  She's been working on it for about 5 days now.  We do take it up, but she's had it up to an hour or so at a time, or several hours when we wanted peace and quiet during the NFL playoffs! I've been very pleased and will definitely order another one!  She's still a puppy, but is about 43 pounds now.  It definitely keeps her busy and she prefers it over my furniture!

review/summary: Good rawhide choice for larger dogs
review/text: My dog is about 50 lbs but acts like she's 70 and I usually avoid rawhides because they can break off in large chunks  that are difficult to digest.  This rawhide is ideal if you worry about that sort of thing.  It will take a long time before they even break through the chew and another long period of the circle slowly getting smaller.  Great product, my dogs loved it, well designed for chewing.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: This is a wonderful chew bone. My dog (vizsla) chews on one of these and it usually lasts her a couple months (shes not an intensive chewer). I find this to be a great value. It is also very amusing to watch a dog carry around this big wreath of rawhide!<br /><br />Great value. As always, Amazon provided extremely fast shipment. Both my dog and I are very pleased.

review/summary: My Dogs' Favorite Gift!
review/text: Santa brought both this Rawhide ring and the rawhide knot by the same manufacturer for my dogs, a Catahoula who LOVES to chew, and my docile Shepherd mix who hasn't shown much interest in anything other than food and sleeping on the couch.  Both the ring and the know were a BIG hit with both dogs; the ring more so than the knot.  They both settled down quickly with these chews, after investigating what the other one had.  The Cata worked on the ring for a bit, and when she put it down, the Shep quickly picked it up and abandoned the knot.  I thought this might cause a fight, but the Cata simply picked up the knot instead.  The ring seemed to be easier for them to manuver in a comfy position, and was definitely preferred over the knot, but both were big hits.  I will be purchasing more of these in the future.

review/summary: Didn't last as long as I had hoped.
review/text: I got two of these based on the wonderful reviews they got.  I have an 11 month old German Shepherd and an 11 month old Labrador Retriever.  They both chew up everything!!  Normal rawhide chews, the 12" ones, last maybe an hour.  Their toys are destroyed, except for that wonderful Kong Ball.  They ate their doghouse, even after I put chicken wire around all the corners.  I didn't know what else to do.  I've read that getting them something to chew on will curb this bad behavior so I opted for two of these rings.  They were completely gone in a day and a half.  I don't know what the previous reviewers meant when they said they had dogs that were incredible chewers.  Anyway, I will buy them more for Christmas, because they do last the longest out of all the treats they've had.  I sure wish I could find something to entertain them for a week!

review/summary: puppy loves it now that she has her adult teeth!
review/text: I have a 6 month old aussie puppy. I bought this more than a month ago and she hadn't touched it, but I felt sure she'd get to it sooner or later. I'd seen her work on it for a long time when I first got it and she wasn't getting anywhere. now she's getting her adult teeth. she picked this up and has hardly set it down for the past 3 or 4 days. she's about 1/4 the way through it with a LOT of time chewing logged on it. I like her to chew himalayan chews and deer antlers because I think they are better for her, but I don't think buying one of these every now and again is going to hurt her, considering we also have a 13 year old dog who isn't a big chewer except for on rawhides (didn't know there were any reasons not to give rawhide when we got him) and he hasn't had issues because of them. for now I'm happy that my puppy is soothing her teeth on her big rawhide ring while I wait for a new himalayan bone in the mail!
