review/summary: Frequently used buy bulk
review/text: Look at buying cumin at your grocery store and then look at the bulk price. You cannot get ripped off like that. Buy some bulk cumin and then put it in a big glass jar. That little plasic jar you buy it in is rediculous. Put a couple of pieces of rice in the glass jar, it will soak up  the moisture and preserve it.

review/summary: Superior spice.
review/text: Very fragrant. I have bought several different types of spices by this company in bulk and they have all been very fresh and good. Plus for the price of four small grocery store bottles of cumin I got 2 lbs. I have found that if you put spices like this right into canning jars and store them in a cool place and keep them completely out of any light they will last for years. It's just not true that they lose their flavor in six months or a year. Not if you store them right. Minimize their exposure to air and light and they will last for a very long time.

review/text: Every bit as good as what you buy in the grocery store, but only a fraction of the cost. If you can can split the order with a friend, the deal is even better. This is a lot cumin.  I use a fair amount of cumin when I cook, but I'm not sure I will be able to use this much cumin before it starts to degrade. Even if I only use half of the cumin I will have saved money.

review/summary: Great price for a massive amount of cumin!
review/text: I cook a lot and go through a supermarket-sized bottle of cumin every couple of weeks, so this is a great product for me. The cumin is indistinguishable from what I previously bought at the supermarket. I think this is a great product for anyone who uses a lot of cumin, but since spices lose their flavor as they age, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't need to buy cumin every time he goes to the store.

review/text: I love Mexican food, and Cumin is a necessary ingredient in such dishes. I really hate going to the grocery store and buying the standard tiny bottles of spices that seem to be incredibly overpriced. Sometimes I can find a better priced spice in the Mexican Food section, but more often not. Needless to say, a 16 oz package is designed for people like me. This is a decent amount that I will not quickly run out of!

Also this is great to use when marinating chicken wings .Marinate the wings for about two days in the refrigerator with plenty of salt and spices. This stuff is really HOT so use sparingly.

review/text: I am such a fan of Dimitri's Classic and Extra Horseradish recipes (they are TREMENDOUS!)so I ordered the Chipolte/Habanero hoping for a smokey pepper version of the same stuff.<br /><br />I am extremely disappointed.  This stuff is SO hot that it totally overpowers all of the other flavors.....you might as well just squirt hot sauce into tomato juice, it would be a lot cheaper and the tast would be about the same.<br /><br />I like hot stuff, but not when the heat is all you can taste.  Perhaps some folks like this blend. Not me.

review/text: I bought these to give to my students. I have around 30 students, so it was economical for the first day of class as a snack. The kids liked them and with hugs, they were a cheap snack option without too many calories. I had 10 leftover, so I tried a few. My favorite was the rainbow one, it tastes the most like a home-made rice krispie treat. The chocolate drizzle is a close second, but the chocolate tastes a little strange. The double chocolate was my least favorite, there's just too much fake chocolate coating and it's too sticky. Overall, a great value, especially for snacks!

review/text: I am so happy to be reviewing and working with tomatoes that are not in cans! That alone impresses me about Pomi tomatoes. Cans make me nervous, I shy away from them whenever I can for health reasons. Also, there are no preservatives, the tomatoes are low in sodium and BPA free. The tomatoes are naturally grown in Italy without pesticides.<br /><br />I made a lasagna with both the strained tomatoes and the chopped tomatoes and it was the best lasagna I have ever had! The sauce was absolutely delicious, rich and fabulous. It was my first time making a lasagna sauce from scratch and I was worried it was going to be boring but it was zesty and stunning.<br /><br />Just last night I made my chili recipe with the chopped tomatoes. Sometimes canned tomatoes can be quite tough and hard to break down but these broke down perfectly. My only complaint is that the chili was a little dryer than usual but it was richer with an even deeper flavour thanks to these tomatoes.<br /><br />I would have bought these solely based on the fact that I could get tomatoes not in cans but after tasting the results of these fantastic tomatoes in my lasagna and chili... I will buy more.

First, they come in 6 packs with 20 bags per pack. The item arrived undamaged. I liked the small packs because it is easier for me to carry to the office. Each tea bag is wrapped in foil bags (to contain the flavor of the tea leaves I presume). The tea by itself is with great flavor and quite strong compare to Lipton tea bags and alike. I often put in one or two fresh mint leaves to jazz it up. Overall, this is a great tea bag to have if you like your tea strong and fragrant!

review/text: I love chili, especially hot chili and have had much better, but never from a canned product.<br /><br />Definitely superior to to Wolf and Stagg brand canned chili, if you like your chili hot.<br /><br />I am spending far less time cooking up batches as this stuff is so great, straight out of the can.

review/summary: VERY Spicy
review/text: This seasoned chili meat is really convenient to have on hand, but be warned--it is very spicy.  I cooked a cup and 1/2 of dried pinto beans and added 2 cans of chili no meat and a can of diced tomatoes to it.  The finished chili needed no other seasonings added.  That's how spicy strong this product is.  I can't imagine eating it on a hot dog straight up.

review/summary: My favorite bag tea
review/text: My friends at work tease me because I have an entire desk drawer dedicated to tea.  I love my tea.  I almost exclusively drink loose leaf tea.  I love the taste and the ritual.  But sometimes I don't feel like taking the time to prepare a pot of loose leaf tea, so I "settle" for a tea bag.<br /><br />PG Tips really isn't a compromise for me though.  I love PG Tips.  It's a great blend of black teas.  The taste is great and the bag is convenient.<br /><br />It's not completely accurate to call this a "bag" though, because it's a pyramid.  The water flows through the pyramid very nicely.  There's no string to take it out with though.  That's OK.  Use a spoon or let it continue to steep while you drink it.<br /><br />Excellent black tea blend!

review/summary: Great Classic English Tea
review/text: I'm normally a strictly loose leaf tea snob but I can't get enough of PG Tips. It's the classic British breakfast tea with the faint muscatel notes found in higher end indian teas. A splash of milk and a dash of sugar to top off, this is how I start each day. Be careful with steeping, if left too long this tea becomes extremely bitter and un-drinkable (unless of course that's your thing!).

review/summary: What can I say - I love this tea
review/text: A native Brit - I am addicted to my PG tips. So, now that I am living in the US I am committed to buying it online. The tea is full-bodied and so flavorful. I brew it straight in my tea mug by pouring boiling water from my electric kettle straight onto the tea bag and let it steep for about a minute. It is strong enough for me by then and then I add my reduced-fat (2%) milk to reach a color akin to pale pine flooring. Drink it piping hot and its a fantastic morning pick-me-up. I prefer to buy it in packs of 40 to keep it fresh but the price on the 80s was hard to pass.

review/summary: Great tasting tea!
review/text: I love all kinds of tea, especially Earl Grey, but for the basic, everyday tea, for hot tea and iced tea, I preferred Lipton. This PG Tips tea has changed my preference, and it has become my new favorite.  I like the crisp, clean taste and I really like the fact that they don't put paper tags and string on the tea bags. I have used it for hot and iced tea, and it works beautifully. I also like the reach in box of loose tea bags; so easy to grab. I bought the box of 80, and I know I will order it again.

review/text: My step-father is Australian and he turned me on to this wonderful tea. It seems to have that great tea flavor without the acidic nature of most teas. It is not a weak tea, but it is not over powering. For the true tea drinker, use the loose leaf. I use these "pyramids" for ease of use. At the very least give it a try, you'll be glad you did.

review/text: Definitely waay better tea than anything I've tried here in the US. The caffeine isn't overpowering like some black teas I've tried and I am particularly sensitive to caffeine. The item arrived and there was tea 'dust' inside the plastic, outside the box, which worried me, but once opened there was no problem with the tea bags at all. There is no string attached to the bags, but this really isn't a problem if you use a spoon for sugar or milk anyway. I got this item very quickly even though I live about as far away from England as you can get... California. Very pleased overall with everything.

We put mint leaves and a tea bag for two small cups, and we also put honey. It smells great. On a evening, after a hard days work, to smell this hot tea, is relaxing. The taste is really great, we love this tea much better compared to other normal ones we see in stores. They claim that they make this tea from the tips of young leaves, and that really does make a difference. Highly recommended tea.

review/text: Mostly I drink coffee but often have a cup of tea too.  First brew was three minutes.  Box said one to three minutes.  Three minutes great taste and high acidity.  Second try two minutes.  Less acid and wonderful taste reminds me of orange blossoms?  Next I will try ONE minute.  When hot water hits tea bag the water instantly changes color to dark tea color.  US Lipton is bland compared to this PG.

review/summary: Not Strong Enough!!! Lacks Full Flavors & Sophistication
review/text: Ok, I've been drinking a variety of hot teas usually with cream & a tad of sugar since the late 1970's... before that iced tea...<br /><br />Amazon did sell this at an excellent price 'IF' you subscribe & it arrived promptly with a VERY FRESH date... expiration in 2013 for best flavor (bought in August 2011).<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea is too weak & too smooth... I have to use 3 tea bags per 10-11oz cup of water to get some strength infused into it for 10 minutes! I recommend Lifeboat Tea (also from UK) over this or Scottish Breakfast if you want even more strength & full flavors.<br /><br />If you don't want strong Full Flavors or Sophistication, then this tea is a buy for smooth & subtle drinking... good for a tea party... to eat little cakes & scones with it. Better it be Lifeboat or Scottish Breakfast, imo, for my tea parties. :-)<br /><br />Right now, my ideal blend would be a combination blend of Scottish Breakfast AND Lifeboat... Lifeboat needs a tiny kick of strength & flavor from the Scottish tea... that's my perfect cuppa tea...<br /><br />If you know a better stronger blend that can top that combo taste, then please comment to this post... and Thanks!!!

The box does indeed contain 48 4-piece bars like the product advertises, which is good because I've had problems before where the amount it said is not the amount I got. When I opened the box, it looked like a lot more than 48 simply because I did not know that 48 4-piece bars would look like so much. The Now and Laters are the delicious banana flavor I remember and are start out hard, and then become chewy, just like their famous motto. Definitely worth the money and the amount you get will last you a long time.

review/text: Walmart, in their infinite wisdom, decided to remove Brach's Gummi Bears from the shelf in favor of some mystery bears packaged under the "Great Value" brand. These generic Walmart bears are all sugar and no sour/tart/fruit flavoring. The green ones taste the exact same as the red, orange and yellow ones. IMHO, they are hideous. I had to come to Amazon to get my fix. I have had imported bears from Germany that were too hard, too tart and cost 4 times as much. For me, these are the best! Btw, if you are trying to quit smoking and you need something relatively harmless to chew on while you contemplate the demise of all the people you know that deserve it; these bears will fill the gap and help you resist giving your boss a piece of your mind when he/she is convinced you can do more with less.

review/summary: Great product but shop around for a better price
review/text: These are our favorite (only!) fruit snack.  We went with these because of two BIG reasons, first they use only natural colorings (artificial colors are a common allergen and they can cause ADD like symptoms) and the sugar used is a less refined sugar which is better for you.  I know these are supposed to be for the kids, but I love them too.  We had been buying them on sale at Target for $2.99 a box, but our local Target only carried the berry flavor, and I like the citrus and the kids like the tropical.  This variety pack is much needed!  On sale at Target it turns out to be 60 cents a pack, this variety pack if you pay Amazon's price with free shipping comes out to 92 cents a pack.  So shop around, and if you have a Costco near you go there, because we just bought this same 24 pack variety box there for under $10 which makes each pack only 41 cents!

review/summary: Worth every penny!
review/text: The only negative to this product is that they are very expensive when compared to most other snack options but it's definitely a case of get what you pay for.  We certainly eat other snacks and treats but the cost of these comes from the fact that not only are they organic but dye free as well.<br /><br />If you have a child that is sensitive to artificial dye you know how hard it can be to find things without making everything from scratch and who had time for that :).<br /><br />These have an incredible taste, love the consistency and the fact that I can feel good about feeding them to my little ones.  A word of caution, since they are so "healthy" I made the initial mistake of treating them like a snack instead of treat.  In reality these are a lot like giving your kids gummy bears, just healthier, but still they are full of sugar and it's easy to eat multiple packages as they are pretty little.

review/summary: A Delicious Snack
review/text: I have always loved fruit snacks, and I couldn't resist trying ones shaped like bunnies. These have a slightly softer texture than traditional fruit snacks, but they have very strong, realistic fruit flavors. The tropical ones are definitely my favorite.  I prefer these to most brands of traditional fruit snacks; however, the price is a little too high to buy them on a regular basis.

review/summary: Why These Are Awesome
review/text: YUMMMY!!!!!! I love how these are vegan and have no gelatin. Just to clarify for everyone - the reason why other fruit snacks are so cheap is because they use almost zero fruit and they use gelatin. Gelatin is made of the ground up parts of animals, usually cow and pig. Soooo gelatin is never vegetarian and usually not kosher. Even if it is kosher, it is still made from ground up parts of cow, and is therefore not vegetarian. So bottom line : Annies is worth every. single. cent. because it is free of gross dead things.

review/text: Was very surprised on how strong the flavors are. They are very delicious. Even though they are a gummy fruit snack you don't feel like you are going to rip your teeth out trying to chew them. They are very soft to chew. Very happy with the product. Also does not have a lot of junk in the ingredients. Like that very much also. All flavors are excellent with a good variety in each pack.

While not a healthy food,it gives me comfort knowing that they are at least made with organic ingredients when my kids want a treat.

review/summary: Great Fruit Snacks!
review/text: I absolutely love these, healthy and yummy with an awesome texture. Texture is really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these have an awesome soft texture. They aren't hard and you don't have to sit there chewing forever; but if you want you can suck not them and they won't just disintegrate or stick to the roof of you mouth. My personal favorite flavors are the Summer Strawberry and the Berry Patch flavors, but all of them are pretty good. =)<br /><br />Another great fruit snack to try if you like this texture is Ocean Spray brand. They are not organic, but they are less than half the price of these. Mott's Medley's all natural fruit snacks are yummy as well and are made with both fruit and vegetable juices! The Mott's ones are also not organic, and not quite as soft as the Ocean Spray or Annie's, but again, much less expensive.

review/summary: Amazing Vegan Gummy Snack
review/text: I have been a vegetarian for almost 6 years for animal rights concerns and there are few things I crave. Gummy snacks are definitely one of them. These are unbelievably addictive and come in small pouches to help with portion control. I am actually using this as a sweet in gift bags for my wedding guests. I cannot praise this enough. The ingredient list contains no high fructose corn syrup or gelatin. The only critique, which did not bother one but did bug my fiance, is that because these use a vegan thickening agent (instead of gelatin) they are slightly softer than most gummies. No matter, these are amazing and I cannot say enough positive things about the Annie's brand.

review/text: My son adores these.  He'd eat the entire box in a sitting if I let him.  They're easy to chew and the variety is nice.  The downside is they're sticky, so I wouldn't suggest them for the car.  They also melt.  I've found them hidden under things a day later and they've melted to the floor because they were too close to the heating vent.  Not fun cleanup.

review/summary: Veggie Snacks are good if you like gummy treats
review/text: It was my fault that I didn't notice that these snacks were actually gummy fruit snacks, where I was expecting dried fruit bits.  I ordered them in a hurry and should have paid closer attention.  I liked them fine but the one I intended them for didn't like them at all - mostly because they stuck to his teeth, which is our problem. Gummy type snacks do tend to stick and most people don't mind it.  The product was good - just not for my kid that's all.  I won't order again just because of that but if he ever changes his tastes, I'm sure he would like it as it tasted fine to me.  The packages were small, about the right size for a kid snack.  So, if you like gummy like snacks, you'll probably like this one.

review/summary: Strange Consistency
review/text: I appreciate the attempt at an organic fruit snack, but I honestly just don't like the taste of these things. I'm not an organic-only shopper or a vegan, so I bought these simply because I heard they were good. After trying one of each flavor, I've decided I'm going to stick with regular fruit snacks. These things have a very strange consistency, almost like mushy gel. They aren't like your normal fruit snack from target or jewel. At this point I am wishing I hadn't bought them, especially considering how expensive they are.<br /><br />So unless you're specifically looking for an organic or vegan fruit snack, I would stay away from these...

review/summary: A Great Green Tea
review/text: I have yet to find a green tea that tastes as good as Bigelow, and is not over powering or bitter. I love pomegranate, so this is the perfect mix for me. Even though pomegranates are sweet, the tea is not a sweet tea. There is no added sweetener and there are no calories in it. It does have a bitter taste, like most green tea, but it is not the earthy-bite that some Green Tea flavors have.<br /><br /> Another warning is this does not taste as good when icing it or attempting to make iced-tea. For some reason the pomegranate becomes more potent when iced, and the green tea flavor fades. I love the taste of green tea and pomegranate but when attempting to mix them in ice tea-neither taste quite like they should.<br /><br />I believe this is one of the most potent green teas on the market! I usually see an improvement in my skin and nails when I drink it regularly!

review/summary: Yummy Tea!
review/text: I had a box of green tea last year that I threw away after only using a couple bags.  It wasn't the tea's fault.  I just don't really like the taste of green tea or most teas in general.<br /><br />But doing all this research on how to keep my skin and body healthy, I found that the #1 thing people recommend is green tea for your skin.  It's the best thing you can do for your skin apparently.  It's packed with antioxidants that help improve your skin elasticity and work wonders for your body.  A lot of beauty products now have it, though it's usually labeled as Camellia sinensis in the ingredients.<br /><br />So knowing this and knowing how much I disliked the taste of green tea, I was pleased when I found this green tea with pomegranate at my local supermarket.  I decided to give it a try and I really liked it.  The pomegranate makes it smell really good.  I add two teaspoons of honey, and it's the best drink there is.  (Pomegranate is also great for your skin.  Burt's Bees Naturally Ageless line has pomegranate as their main ingredient.)  And I can get two pretty good cups out of one bag.  I liked it so much that I bought a 6 box supply on Amazon (great price) so that I could drink it every day.

review/summary: Another of my favorite flavors from Bigelow Tea
review/text: I am a big tea drinker. I enjoy finding new flavors that blend well with the tea flavor. Pomegranate is one of my favorite fruits to begin with, and it is really good for you. Add the benfits of green tea and you have a healthy flavored drink (cold or hot) that beats drinking soda.<br />If you are tired of water having no taste, here is another benefit of drinking this tea. I find it tasty enough that I don't need to add any sweetener. When I offer it to guests, some prefer just a little sweetener (one or two splenda).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R4G4PO">Bigelow Green Tea with Pomegranate 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R4G4PO">Bigelow Green Tea with Pomegranate 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>
