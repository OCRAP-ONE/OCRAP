review/summary: This stuff is amazing
review/text: I don't just limit this sauce to dipping in gyoza (although nothing on earth can beat it for dipping in some fresh, hot gyoza!). It is wonderful on almost anything. I add it to steamed veggies, meatloaf, even to baked macaroni and cheese. It is so delicious and adds a fantastic flavor to pretty much anything you can imagine.

review/summary: Bad Packaging, Great product but can't recommend shipping
review/text: I'm giving this a one star because obviously there is a problem with the packaging seals on this product. The only reason I order is that I don't have time to go buy these at a local store which is about an hour from my house--thus ordering makes sense. Except that when my shipment arrives there are 3 packages out of the 6 boxes that are leaking. I open up the box and there is a terrible stench. Spoiled coconut water smells awful, especially in the 100 degree summer temps we've been having. So I unpack the boxes, and pour out the spoiled contents because of the smell, and then go to Amazon to try to report that 3 out of the 6 boxes in the package were damaged. Well, it looks like the only option is to return the package or request a refund. I need the other 3 boxes that were not leaking, and can't find an option to report this to anyone. Then I read the other reviews for this product and note that I'm not the only one whose experienced issues with leaking during shipment. Since there doesn't appear to be a way to be credited for only the items in the shipment that were leaking, and keep the others, and I would have had to get clean boxes and repack the horrible smelling boxes in new packaging to ship back, I just decided to keep the undamaged ones, and to let others know. I won't be ordering this size again in the future, and will just make the one hour trip to my grocer that carries the larger size and then buy locally in bulk next time.<br /><br />Note: if you try the product it is really good, but the packaging leaves a lot to be desired.

review/summary: Vita Coco Buyers BEWARE- Mold inside
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>I have been on the coconut water wagon for over 2 years now.  I truly feel there is no better coconut water than the one that comes directly from the source in hand.  Because fresh coconuts are not easy to find I started buying Vita Coco over a year ago.  From all other coconut waters out there I felt theirs was the best tasting, best quality and I also liked the fact that the source of the water came from just one country and not multiple ones.  I have been a happy consumer for over a year, most of my purchases came from the local supermarket until I decided to purchase the vita coco 6 pack on Amazon as part of the subscribe and save program I gave a box to my mother in law. Earlier this week she opened one of the containers and she said the taste seemed a bit off, a little rancid and she felt like I had swallowed something more than just water. She decided to take a closer look and I was appalled at what she uncovered. Huge chunks of mold her water; it made her sick to her stomach. I am sad to say that after this experience we will no longer consume this product. My concern is what kind of quality control is out there and is this the first incident.  I have heard many reviews talking about rancid taste and moldy taste I wonder how many of those containers had the same stuff inside.  Worse of all is that I have been giving this water to my 3 year old who loves coconut water. My mother in law sealed the container and took these pictures I have contacted the company but I have yet to hear from anyone.

review/summary: Great product but poor packaging.
review/text: Again, I had a problem with the product leaking ---  Both my original and replacement order. The manufacturer's packaging simply does not protect the contents enough. The box soaked through and this time, one of the top faces just tore right off because it was so damp.<br /><br />When I buy other liquids from Amazon such as the "Zola Acai drink"<br />([...]), the plastic containers are better equipped to sustain the shipping process unlike these coconut water cartons.<br /><br />I really enjoy Vita Coco's coconut water products. The taste is light, refreshing and hardly sweet at all. And yes, it is thirst-quenching. However, I do not recommend this larger packaging size. The other tetra packaging for the smaller individual cartons is better equipped for impact. Since I lost much of the drink from the leakage on both orders, I cannot give a high rating. However, I will give credit where credit is due and Amazon has been prompt to respond to my concerns.

review/summary: Electrolyte and potassium rich, no added sugar
review/text: This product also comes in the single serving size<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0R8I">Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a><br />with little straws attached. The single-servings have 11.1 ounces, while the 34-ounce carton says it has four servings of 8.5 ounces each. I still drink about 11+ ounces per serving, so get a little more than 3 servings per carton.<br /><br />This is 100% pure natural coconut water, with no added sugar. The 8.5-ounce size serving contains 45 calories, 0 fat calories, 30mg of sodium, 515mg of potassium, 11g carbohydrate in the form of naturally-occurring sugars (no fiber), 0g protein, 4% of the daily value (based on a 2,000 calorie diet) of calcium, 4% daily value of phosphorous, 175% of the daily value of Vitamin C, 0% daily value of iron, and 8% daily value of magnesium. This means that Vita Coco 100% pure coconut water has more electrolytes, with 15 times more potassium, than leading sports drinks, without the added sugars and/or artificial sweeteners and other added ingredients (dyes, etc.)<br /><br />It gives excellent hydration. My only regret is that I didn't find Vita Coco before I did a 26.2-mile marathon back in 2002. I still take frequent walks, and with Vita Coco, I never cramp.<br /><br />I have noticed that my blood is clotting better/wounds are healing more quickly. I occasionally get small scratches from my cat, and have gotten various scratches from shrubbery encountered on my walks, and recently, a sharp knife got the better of me and I cut my fingertip. It was during these recent instances that I noticed the faster healing time and better blood clotting. I monitor my body's processes closely and can attribute these improvements, at least in large part, to consuming coconut water.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: My discovery of coconut water was brought on by a search for a natural alternative to Pedialite (There aren't many pronouncable ingredients in Pedialite and none I'd put in my baby's little body.) Coconut water is the best alternative, good for you, and the taste is simply refreshing. Not too sweet, but not boring either! A great solution to dehydration! This size is great to keep in the fridge. . . certainly more friendly to the environment! A great price on Amazon . . .

review/summary: Shipping issues - product leaked
review/text: The product is delicious. But I had shipping problems. I ordered 12 boxes (pack of 6). Each box came in at different times, with different UPS tracking numbers. So I had to make sure I was home on different days, and had to keep track of each package. One package was damaged in shipping. UPS reported the damage, and I was reimbursed. On the rest of the shipment (11 separate packages), some of the individual VITA Coco 34 oz boxes leaked.  The aluminum seal is not very strong, and caused the coconut water to leak in several boxes. The seal in the 11 oz package of VITA Coco is bigger and stronger than the seal in the 34 oz package.  I would never have this item shipped again, unless they change the packaging. I think the leak was not the fault of UPS, but the fault of VITA Coco packaging. I bought the 34 oz box from a grocery, and noticed that some of the seals were also defective.

review/text: I ordered two boxes of 6 VitaCoco water.  I only received one box, so clearly I was miffed that I was missing half my order.  Making matters worse, after opening the box that contained the six Vitacocos, the packing cardboard was clearly wet, and indeed a box had burst and leaked Vitacoco water all over the insides.<br /><br />According to the Amazon returns policy, the items could not be returned, but customer service was willing to refund the purchase.  So kudos to Customer Service, but jeers for everything else.

review/summary: Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 34 oz  Boxes pack of 6
review/text: Amazon.com packed this product very well and the package was not damaged during shipment.<br /><br />The Vito Coco product I ordered and received (as titled) was not as good condition.  On 4 of the 34 oz boxes, the seals were broke slightly.  All 4 with broken seals were dripping very slightly - very noticeable as I held onto them.  The slight pressure used to hold them caused the dripping out of the seal before ever removing the seal. Two of the containers was smashed on the top - both of which were 2 of the 4 with broken seals. When I opened some of the shipping packages of these products, it smelled moldy.<br /><br />The seal for the opening is flimsy and could easily be damaged. Some of the seals were far too easy to remove - not the kind of seal you want to use for this heavy weight - 34 oz product.<br /><br />I only have one other coconut water to compare this product to, and that is the brand O.N.E.  Compared to O.N.E., the taste of this product was off - a taste of decay or mold. Some tasted moldier than others. I drank them all anyway (with no apparent ill affects), except for 3 of the 4 in which the seals were broken.  3 of the 4 with broken seals, I poured down the drain.<br /><br />The price of the 34 oz 6 pack product of Vita Coco is excellent in comparison to other coconut water brands on the market, but is it worth it?  Not to me.  I will not be buying this product again unless they improve IF the price remains the same.

review/summary: No leaks, No dents, great taste, seems like the packing issues have been fixed
review/text: Vita Coco's packing was a fitted box with extra cardboard and probably not enough on it's own. Amazon's added heavy duty bubble wrap that had very little give (different to what I usually see for other items) and box was packed well and I got my Vita Coco in quick time and in perfect condition. No leaks, no dents, all 6 boxes tasted good! Will now consider the monthly subscription. I was hesitant based on the poor reviews I saw about packing...but I think Amazon seems to have fixed that. Also I got from the other reviews that there was a bad batch that got shipped out which affected a lot of people. It also seemed that most people got replacements which I would be fine with. Will buy again.

review/summary: 1 Liter for about the calories of a can of coke
review/text: First, let me note that there are several different manufacturers of these 1 liter bottles of coconut water. I have tried this variety (Vita Coco) and the Zico brand, which were comparable in price and quality. Both were delicious, though only about half the people here at the office that tried it shared that opinion. So young coconut water may be something of a specific taste.<br /><br />I'm a fan of coconut water (both Zico and Vita Coco) because they are very refreshing when served cold. As they claim, it does naturally contain some of the same compounds found in sports drinks that are supposed to speed hydration (take that with a grain of salt...water hydrates just as well as anything).<br /><br />But best of all - 34 fl. ounces (1L) of (Zico/Vita Coco) coconut water = ~173 calories. One can of coke (12 fl. oz) = ~143 calories (according to the label, other sites claim more). The cocount water also has a fair amount of potassium and a small amount of other vitamins, whereas cola has almost no nutritional value at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Both companies shipped my coconut water all the way to Afghanistan in good sturdy packaging too, I might add.

I am a loyal Amazon customer and that will not change, but I will never order Vita Coco to be shipped again.

review/text: The coconut water was great - the usual taste I've come to expect from Vita Coco plain coconut water. It's pretty good for packaged, store-bought coconut water.<br /><br />The packaging is terrible.<br />- The containers have a seal you need to tear in order to pour. When you pull on the tiny tab, 2 out of 3 will rip without opening the seal.<br />- The six containers were well protected in carton shell, but they were a bit hard to take out. I ended up ripping off one of them open while removing it from packaging, and spilling some product. This is because the plastic top (opening) sticks out a bit from the side, as to help with pouring without dripping. However the problem is that it's easy to get it ripped open as you're sliding it out of the carton packaging.

That is until i received my second shipment and found a box full of sticky Vita Coco packages with two of the boxes open and half empty.

review/summary: Great product, leaking boxes :(
review/text: Something is definitely wrong with vita coco's boxes. Two of them leaked enough to soak the cardboard boxes they came in. I checked and it appears to be something wrong with their peal back seals rather than the boxes themselves and I will be calling the company so they can address their faulty packaging since it's not Amazon. The drink itself is better than a few that I've tried thus far. I mix them with protein powder after the gym or sip them on their own. Very tasty. Better than Zico which tasted strange to me.<br /><br />If you order it and get a pack that leaks, call the company and complain. They need to know from anyone who has a leaking product that their product is faulty. It's not amazon as the foil seal on the boxes wasn't secure. In fact, I'll be raising issues of product tampering as a safety issue.<br /><br />The drink itself is great. The packaging not so much.

review/text: When I was little and in Vietnam, I used to taste coconut juice every time I went to the country-side to visit my grandparents.  This brings back that memory.  I really like it.  It's not too sweet, and I can definitely taste a salty element of the juice.  However, it's a balanced taste.  At first, when you take a sip, it might taste a little sour or as if it has gone bad.  However, the more you drink it, the better it gets. One warning though:  it's a natural laxative.  So, be very careful where you are drinking for the very first time.  Let your body have a reacation to it first before bringing to sport events, work, etc.  It's better when chilled.  Enjoy :)

review/text: Vita Coco Coconut Water has become a vital part of my day. A few months ago, I read that Vita Coco has 15 times more electrolytes than any sports drink on the market. However, I do not consider this drink just a sports drink. For example I have swapped my morning coffee with a 100% pure Vita Coco. Unlike drinking coffee and than crashing, Vita Coco makes me feel energized throughout the day! Whenever I make breakfast smoothies, I always use Vita Coco. Below is a great recipe to try!<br /><br />3 cups frozen strawberries<br />1 banana (or 1 cup of blueberries)<br />1 cup Vita Coco (I use 100% pure)<br />1 cup of icecubes (optional)<br /><br />Place all ingredients in a blender and puree well. Add more Vita Coco if needed for smoothier consistency. Too easy, too good!<br /><br />I swear by this drink. I used to get cramping in my muscles and shin splints after running...but when I drink this before and after my run, I do not feel any pain....<br /><br />Simply put when I drink Vita Coco, I feel more refreshed and healthier. So thanks for making such a great product!

review/summary: Tastes great but packaging needs improvement!
review/text: I signed up for the subscription hoping the bad reviews were just flukes on the shipping.  The taste is great as always, but one of my boxes was damaged in shipping and leaked all over my laundry room.  I should have contacted the retailer to get it replaced but I just mopped up the mess and made a mental note to cancel my subscription and order a smaller size.  I do wish they would address the shipping/packing problem as it has been mentioned more than once on this site.  Whomever is making the executive decisions for their packing and shipping needs to come up with a better plan or more customers will go elsewhere!

review/summary: Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water
review/text: If you like coconut water, this is for you! I had bought this product at a local market to try, while having chemo. Turns out the more i drank, the more i wanted! It has potassium in it, and some chemo makes you potassium deficient. So, i felt better drinking this product,along with lots of water, to say hydrated.

review/text: It's summertime, with lots of days over 100 degrees F. in Central California. Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water comes to the rescue! It's the most refreshing drink I have ever had, and the added Vitamin C takes care of that nutritional requirement at the same time. Also, Vita Coco tastes much better than other coconut waters I have tried.

review/summary: Just for the record...
review/text: Amid all the horror stories and bad experiences with this product that several other people have unfortunately had, I would like to write my own review. Vita Coco is my favorite brand of coconut water and I have been drinking it for a couple years now, and I recently decided to try ordering by the case here at Amazon instead of hunting down the odd carton or two at stores across my city (it's not that easy to find in San Antonio!) like I had been doing before. I was weary of giving Amazon a shot because of the other reviews with people's negative experiences, but luckily and thankfully I experienced none of those shipping and/or quality control issues with the water! My box of 6 1L Vita Coco's arrived promptly, was well packaged and the water itself was well within a reasonable expiration date (April 2013)! I couldn't be happier and look forward to getting my cases of VC shipped to me on a regular monthly basis with Subscribe & Save now! Hooray!

review/summary: Great packaging!! No leaking cartons!!
review/text: First of all I LOVE VitaCoco Coconut water!! So ordering it was a no brainer for me. I had read several reviews that some people had issues with leaking containers when they received their shipment. It appears that Amazon or VitaCoco has taken steps to remedy this problem. I ordered the 6 - 33.8oz containers. They came packaged snug in a box that fit them perfectly. And that box was then wrapped in bubble wrap and put inside another box! No leaking! I am sooo happy with my order. I hope this review will help others with the decision on ordering this product. Based on some of the reviews that I had read, I almost didn't order from online. Hope this helps =)

review/text: I had a friend turn me on to coconut water for running because of the high amounts of potassium it has. It also has no added sugar and is a great alternative to gatorade. I think it tastes great cold and I like the convienince and packaging of the 1 quart boxes. I hope they continue to use the boxes instead of plastic because it biodegrades a little easier. Amazon had a great deal on a 6 pack of these, and you can't get them cheaper anywhere else. I paid about $1.70 for an 8 oz box in a grocery store. This was $3-4 for 4 times the amount.

review/text: Great product but I must agree with other reviewers about packaging - ordered two cases. One was fine. The other one had one of the corners of one of six cartons frayed and about half a cup of cocowater made the packaging damp. Not sure how it gets frayed as it was packaged inside two other boxes... Great product, bad packaging.<br /><br />Looks like Amazon is doing something about it since the item is under review. Kudos to them!

review/text: Amazon does not always carry this 34-ounce container of Vita Coca Coconut Water (comes in package of 6). Wait, however, and it pops up on occasion.<br /><br />I think this is the best, sweetest tasting coconut water around. Even the Vita Coco in the smaller containers do not match the taste of the 34-ounce package. I have no idea why this would be the case, but after months of comparing it is simply, to my taste buds, true.<br /><br />The Amazon price is comparable to the prices I find at our local grocery store. Note that if Amazon does not have it in stock, private sellers do, and they always charge a lot more (plus shipping!).

review/summary: best tasting coconut water in a box so far
review/text: i bought this from a local store after trying various other brands (zico, harvest bay and 2-3 others that I can't remember).<br /><br />Hands down, this one is the best.  the other brands had a much more mild coconut flavor, and none of the sweetness you get from fresh coconut water.  vitacoco is there on all fronts.<br /><br />now, I won't say it tastes exactly the same as fresh coconut water, but in a pinch, it's definitely the best brand I've found.<br /><br />also, just as a price hint, look for it at your local stores.  I'm in Seattle and found it at Fred Meyer on sale: $3 for 34oz box...half the price of amazon.  unfortunately, fred meyer only had 1 box left.  :(

review/text: I used to live in Hawaii and really missed fresh coconut water.  The water from supermarket coconuts are hit and miss.  I have tried Zico, ONE and Vita Coco, and although they are all good, I find Vita to be the best tasting.  The only complaint I have is that it is a little pricey, but it is worth it for something so tasty and healthy.<br /><br />Just one more note, you sometimes see coconut water in cans.  That stuff usually has fillers and added sugar.  Always read the labels before buying because there is a lot of junk out there.

Well Vita Coco just did all the work for you.  Each carton is 100% pure coconut water.  This stuff taste fantastic cold and you can just gulp an entire 11 oz pack in like 5 seconds.  People say it is provides better hydration that sports drinks and a ton of other scientific stuff about it, but in the end, I just bought it cause I like the taste of coconut water and this is pure 100% coco water.  Get it both for taste and it's health benefits.

review/summary: The puppy loves this!
review/text: If my dog could review this product, she'd give it 5 stars. She obviously loves the bacon flavor and being a very licky puppy, this is a real treat for her. As the pet owner, I like that she seems so content with the product, but it's a non-traditional way of delivering a treat and seems a bit awkward. The treat is given through a roll-on ball, like the old deodorants. With little treat bites, you can reward a dog with one or two nibbles, but regulating the number of licks or the time they're allowed to lick doesn't work so well. For training purposes, I wouldn't recommend this product, but just for gratuitous treat giving, I think it's just fine.

She really thought at some point I would give up and give her the bottle. I am passing it on to a friend who is trying to train her dog not to pull on the leash. I realize this is a training tool but my dog didn't seem to think so. She did like the taste.

review/summary: Smells Super; Our Dogs Have no Taste Appreciation
review/text: I reluctantly give this a 3 due mainly to the smell of the Liver Flavor.  The sole purpose of the product is to offer a flavorful break from the ordinary dog food flavors they normally receive but alas both picky Yorkies refused on several occasions to even take a good whiff.  They love freeze dried livers from chickens, beef, pig and lamb but cannot stand Lickety Stik.  Just to test the situation I tried the Stik first and it was a resounding NO.  Then after they had freeze dried livers and again it was NO.  I took their favorite dry food and applied a small amount on several pieces and mixed them in with untreated food.  They literally segregated the morsels into edible and Stiks.  The Stiks did not get touched while the unflavored were eaten with vigor.  Determined to prove that the Yorkies are just picky I offered a few licks to the neighbor's Retriever and he looked at me as if I am the fool I am.  Success did not open its heart on several days ago nor did it when I tried one more time with the same negative results.  I cannot say that any of the other flavors have any similar aspects since I only received the one container.  Bottom line:  Human Rating: 3  Dog Rating: 1 too many.  Sorry but the effort was there.

review/summary: Our Six Dogs LOVE The Lickety Stik!!!
review/text: Our six dogs (four of our own, plus two foster dogs) all LOVE getting their "licks" from this Bacon Flavor Lickety Stik!!!  They are all medium to big dogs (Boxer mixes, Pit Bull mix, Black Lab mix , Plott Hound & Greyhound mix) and they all come a-runnin' when I pull the bottle out.  Even Mollie, our finicky-eater Black Lab mix, loves it.  Sometimes, they try to take a bite, but they all quickly figure out that the trick is to lick the little roll-on-deodorant-type ball.  The key, of course, is to hold the bottle while the dogs help themselves, as opposed to giving them the bottle to do with what they please...  ;o)<br /><br />The bottom line is the Bacon Flavored Lickety Stik gets a unanimous "Four Paws Up" from my test panel!  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Interesting way to "treat" your dog!
review/text: I have to say this is an unusual product.  It's made on the same order as a deodorant and the dog licks the roller to get the flavoring.  We got the liver flavor and all the dogs loved it.  In fact, there was some times when two dogs were trying to lick the roller at the same time since they can't seem to wait their turn.  It's definitely something to try...don't know how well it would do training your dog instead of the regular treats, though.  It'll probably get gross after a few lickings too but a damp paper towel should fix it up...especially if you wipe it after the dog uses it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't comment if it really tastes like liver flavor.  The dog's aren't talking but they definitely seem to like it...<br /><br />Oh yeah, and its made in the USA!

review/summary: Interesting Idea - Little Dogs Loved It
review/text: Well, the title says it all.  The little dogs of the household loved this interesting twist on the traditional treat.  They did not seem to understand why they were not allowed to walk off with it, but they grasped the concept eventually.  Often traveling with our two smallest poms, this "roll-on" style treat is a simple, non messy, non-poop-inducing alternative to traditional treats.  It is "just enough" when you want to reward them without having to worry about making a mess in the car.  I am not sure if this concept will catch on with the mainstream, but as long as it is competitively priced, I can see this being a useful tool for many dog-rearing activities.  While we are far past that stage, I can see this being helpful for different training activities as well.  Bring yourself and your dog "outside of the bubble" and give this new treat a try.

review/summary: One weird idea
review/text: Can you imagine how this product came to fruition?  It seems like an accident.  Like the guys in R&D accidentally filled some roll-on deodorant tubes with dog food flavoring.  Or maybe it was a large-scale Big Lots-style buy where the guys at the pet food factory got an incredibly great deal when a Ban roll-on factory got flooded and had to unload a warehouse.<br /><br />In any event, what seems like a really weird idea is...well, a really weird idea that our dog LOVES.  Of course there's not much nutritional value to letting your dog take a few slurps off the end of a liver-flavored roll-on doggie treat, but hey, there's not much nutritional value to that rawhide toy you just bought him either.  Give this a try for dessert.

review/text: When I first saw this I wasn't to sure but I love to give my pups new things to try. When it came in I checked it out....it looks like a roll on deodorant. I had to laugh but then came the taste test. I think my dogs are in love with this! We have small dogs...all less than 6lbs and I have to roll the ball for them to get more flavor so it's not so bad but I imagine that larger dogs can roll the ball themselves. If you're looking for something new and different then you may want to give this one a try!

review/summary: Doggie "crack"....Lol!
review/text: I ordered this, not sure if my dogs would like the roller ball or turn their noses up at it, but I'm happy to report they loved it! They went at it with gusto-so much so that I had to put it away after only a few licks-afraid they might make themselves sick. Little did I know that my little monsters would find a way to knock it off the shelf & absolutely destroy the bottle while I was at the grocery store. I came home to a shredded bottle & 2 pomeranians with very guilty looks on their faces.....<br />I think this is a great product & if the reaction of my dogs is any indication-so do they. I will definitely be ordering more when it becomes available, but might have to invest in a lock box to keep it in....lol!

review/summary: loved it
review/text: I have the most picky dog in the world.  She's a big dog, which usually means they'll eat anything, but not my dog, so when I got her the Likety Stik, I honestly didn't think she'd like it, but she loved it!  And what a great training tool.  Rather than fill your pocket with treats,(that usually go through the wash) you have a neat, no fuss way to reward them.<br /><br />I did have to squeeze it to get the liquid moving along after she'd licked it, and it dripped onto her pure white, newly bathed ruff, but it came off with just water, so no worries.<br /><br />I then took the Stik over to my in-laws to give to their obese King Charles spaniel, and he of course loved it, because he eats anything.  What they liked was being able to give him treats that didn't add to his weight problem.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a great new way of treating your dog.  Whoever came up with it is a genius.  I'm going to buy every flavor for my dog, and one for my in-laws dog.

review/summary: Roller Jams, Wasted Product
review/text: The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism.

review/summary: Lily LIKED It!!
review/text: My little diabetic shih-tzu, Lily, is notorious for hating anything new. I am constantly on the search for healthy new treats that I can give her after she has her insulin shot (every 12 hours...ugh!) I received the Liver flavor Lickety Stik and was prepared to donate it to the local animal shelter because I was just sure Lily would turn up her nose to it. Lo and behold...she liked it! It took a minute or two for her to figure out how to get the treat out and I squeezed the bottle too hard and some dripped on the floor, but Lily quickly lapped it up. I don't think the ball turned very easily, but she was determined to try to get the treat-juice out of the bottle. I think this is a great idea, but I am only giving it 4 stars because the packaging was hard to read and the ball didn't seem to turn very readily.

review/text: The smell and taste of the Lickety Stik was an instant success with our dog.<br />But the dispensing ball dosen't move easily, very much of the time,<br />and it's a nuisance for us to keep helping the ball turn for our dog to get this treat.<br />We get more on our hands then our Golden gets in his mouth.<br />When we try to turn the ball for our dog, even we find it difficult.<br /><br />The roller BALL is a concern, we don't consider it 'pet safe'.<br />If our Golden Retriver got this bottle,<br />he could easily bite this roller ball out and would try to eat it.<br /><br />The ball requires a strong tounge to move it, even at that it gets stuck.<br />We can't imagine this stik being at all compatible with small dogs.<br />If you squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out around the ball<br />most of that drops to the ground between licks.<br /><br />This would be a great idea if it worked, and was truely 'pet safe'.

review/summary: Great Idea- My dog loves it.
review/text: I have one dog, Rex, a Shepherd/Lab mix and he absolutely loves the Lickety Stik. Now if he sees me get it out, he automatically sits or gives me his paw. So cute.<br /><br />This is a great new idea for doggy treats. Especially when walking my dog- I've gotten tired of carrying a bag of treats for him. And new ideas are always welcome, I don't want to overfeed my dog with other treats... They can get expensive because he's allergic to almost everything.<br /><br />So the lickety sticks come in three flavors- liver, chicken and bacon. Rex loved each one. The container that holds the liquid treat is a roller... I saw another reviewer describe it like a deodorant stick with a roller. That is exactly what the case is like. Unfortunately the liquid doesn't just come out when the ball is licked, the bottle has to be squeezed for your dog. My roller gets stuck if I don't squeeze or push it with my finger.<br /><br />I highly suggest trying this item out, great alternative to milk bones :)

review/summary: Great Idea for Dispensing Dog Treats
review/text: Really like the idea of a roller-ball to give treats, especially as rewards when training (skateboard, leash walking and close commands).  The dispenser is similar to a roll-on deodorant design.  Lickety Stik is a healthy all natural (according to the ads) liquid containing vitamins and low in calories in several flavors. The dispenser contains over 500 licks.  A no mess way to give rewards plus it carries the made in the USA with all-natural ingredients.  My English Bulldog puppy loves the stuff (liver flavor); however, it also comes in chicken and bacon flavors. Following  is a list for those who read the ingredients,  1)natural liver flavors, (2) cultured milk, (3) lecithin, (4) mixed tocopherols (natural preservative- a source of vitamin E), (5) scorbyl palmitate (source of vitamin C), (6) rosemary extract, (7) green tea extract.  A caution about dogs allergic to chicken - they should not be licking this stuff. Unlike most treats, the shelf life is 18 months and "best" licked by date is stamped on the bottom of the roll-on dispenser. The description indicates the Lickety Stik formula contains antimicrobial agents - basically no germ transfer. The stuff does not have to be refrigerated.  Naturally, you must shake the dispenser often.  Will be ordering the Lickety Stik 3 pack with all flavors from Amazon.  "Reilly" recommends the treat!

review/summary: Great, low-cal training treat.
review/text: I had to give the ball a partial turn to get some of the liquid on it after shaking to mix it up, but after I did that my dog licked away and loved it! This is a good low-cal treat for dogs and would be great as a training aid. Our dog dutifully performed her repertoire of tricks to get more of the treat, and then followed me back to the kitchen as I put it away. The only bad thing is that you DO have to hold it for the dog, but if you're using it as a training aid that may actually be an advantage.<br /><br />There are over 500 licks in each tube and 10 licks is only 1 calorie. I gave my dog 10 licks per trick.<br /><br />FWIW, my dog is a 1.5 year old hound dog/bird dog mutt.

review/summary: Good for a go around, but probably not the staple snack for Charlie
review/text: The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're "healthier;" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that.

review/summary: My dogs love it, even if it is funny looking
review/text: PetSafe Lickety Stik is a weird looking dispenser full of a delicious liquid treat my pooches are crazy about.  The strange design is slightly bigger than a deoderant bottle and the dogs get their treat by licking the roll-on ball!<br /><br />I own Wonderland Kennels, with 7 Boston Terriers and German Shepherds that I train and compete with.  Even the picky ones love this stuff.  The bottle is small, but it goes a loooong way because the pups are only getting a little at a time, instead of a larger treat.<br /><br />Pacino and Molly (German Shepherds) first instincts were to try to bite down on the dispenser, but it didn't crack and is still holding up fine.  They quickly learned to just lick it, though the best way to introduce it to larger dogs is to hold it completely upside-down so the angle makes it easier to lick and harder for them to grab.<br /><br />I'm honestly surprised by how big a hit this little Lickety Stik is with my pups, and how long the bottle lasts.  Maizy, Molly, Gracie, Pixi, Einstein, Pacino, and Isabelle each give it four paws up!  :)

review/summary: Whoa!  My Dog REALLY Likes this Thing!
review/text: When I received this "Lickety Stik", I really wasn't sure what to expect with my dog.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about - he is CRAZY about it.  If I even go near the bottle he starts wagging his tail and giving me the excited look.  One aspect about this doohickey I really like is that you can use it as a reward for your pet, without constantly having to give him a biscuit or similar treat; just a lick off the Lickety Stik will do the trick!  The occasional biscuit and treat is okay, but this is much better for active training.  Highly recommend, though you may want to shy away from trying it yourself.

The container is 5" tall and approx. 1 1/2" around and easily fit right in my jeans pocket, so this would be very easy to take on a walk. I could also see that this might be helpful if you happen to have a dog who won't eat - you could roll the liquid around the edge of his bowl and it may entice him to eat.

It is clean, you can keep it in your pocket and not end up with little bits of kibble in the laundry.<br />Our dogs are Great Pyrenees and Border Collie.

review/summary: An innovative invention much appreciated by canines
review/text: with the exception of my senior chihuahua that viewed the container of Lickety Stik as possibly a lethal weapon and, not wishing to take any chances, tore out of the room when she saw it for under-the-bed protection.<br /><br />"Oh well," I said, "I've got three other dogs.  Let's try them."  At first my toy bichon-poodle was also wary and stepped back.  But when she saw my shepherd and chow chow growing very excited and thrilled by this new offering, she relented and tasted some herself.  It was a decided hit.<br /><br />There are no directions on the small plastic container as to how to use, so I was uncertain if I should squeeze it and, if so, how tightly.  I quickly learned that squeezing it too firmly causes the liquid to pour out so, if squeezed, "lightly" should be the watchword.  I would advise the first time trying it to place a paper towel under the container until one gets the hang of manipulating the small plastic bottle and administering the treat to the dog(s), which will not be a problem as my two large dogs, and eventually the smaller one, just kept wanting to lick and lick and keep on licking.  They found this new-found gadget to be very exciting.<br /><br />What is most appealing about it to me is that it contains all natural ingredients - nothing artificial.  They consist of natural flavors, cultured milk, lecithin, rosemary extract and green tea extract.  It also contains Vitamin A.<br /><br />So this is a fun way to make your dog(s) happy, small enough to carry in your pocket, light enough for easy carrying.  Now I've only used it once, but I predict that the next time my dogs (chihuahua excepted) see me holding the by now familiar container, there'll be a stampede of sorts.

review/summary: I think this is an unsafe product
review/text: Do you know those Tootsie Pop commercials where they'd see how many times the Tootsie Pop could be licked before they'd chew right into it?  That's how this Likety Stik worked with my dog.  He licked it three or four times, then immediately wanted to chew on the roller.  I repeatedly pulled it out each time he'd try, but it kept repeating.  Lick, lick, lick, chew.  Lick, lick, lick chew.  Within one minute, no exaggerating, he had chewed off the end and I was scared to death that he'd swallow the roll ball. Fortunately he spit it out, but if he had swallowed it, he easily could have choked to death on it with it blocking his windpipe.  I would never buy this product again, and highly recommend others not to.  Seriously, it was completely chewed through in one minute of opening the package.

review/summary: Fun Idea
review/text: This is a nice idea for a low calorie dog treat.<br /><br />It looks just like a roll-on antiperspirant, and you have to roll the ball to get it going. One problem is that this is a syrup or other liquid that is pretty sticky and I usually have to get the ball rolling myself each time. Also, once I offer it to my dogs they can get one lick but cannot get the ball moving.<br /><br />The other problem I've had is my dogs want to take the whole thing, not just lick the surface of it. They seem to like the taste because they really grab the whole thing.<br /><br />I think it's a fun idea and it does seem to taste great to them, though I wouldn't really recommend it because of the ball being hard for dogs to roll. (in my experience)

review/summary: Dog was a fan, but I wasn't
review/text: I have a 60lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix who loves all sorts of treats so I'm always on the lookout for new products. Unfortunately, many doggie treats have gotten a bit pricey these days if you plan on giving them a helping. When the PetSafe Lickety Stik (essentially the same design as a roll-on deodorant) popped up on Amazon Vine I naturally snatched one up right away. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Low in calories, 1 per 10 licks.<br /><br />+ My dog loved them.<br /><br />+ Container has a re-sealable cap.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Fluid can drip out of roller ball and leave a sticky residue on surfaces.<br /><br />- Container is not really pet safe if the dog gets ahold of the treat.  Most dogs could easily chew apart the package and choke on the roller ball.<br /><br />- Doesn't promote healthy chewing, essential for a dog's teeth.<br /><br />- Small container is not good for bigger or messier dogs.  My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br /><br />- Smells absolutely awful.<br /><br />My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.  Still, I wouldn't pay the asking price for the item. The best thing about this treat was they occupied my dog long enough to groom him sufficiently.

review/summary: Potentially messy but my dog loves it.
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>Lickety Stik is a lickable (vs. edible) dog treat that comes in a variety of flavors, such as bacon, liver and chicken.  The container looks something like an old-style stick of deordorant with a plastic ball under the cap that LOOKS like it would roll around, but is actually stationary.  You squeeze the bottle until the gravy-like liquid treat starts to ooze out AROUND the ball and the dog licks it off. If you're not careful (i.e., if you squeeze too hard, esp. if you are treating a small dog like mine), you could end up with a mess on the floor.  That said, it is not difficult to master how hard to squeeze to treat the dog...just be forewarned to squeeze gently until you find the right pressure to use.<br /><br />As you will see in the accompanying video, my dog adores the flavor (I was using the liver flavor Lickety Split in the video).  She whines for it sometimes several times a day (she knows where I keep it).  However, she has a sensitive stomach and I have had to switch over to predominantly allergy-formula food and treats to reduce (and almost eliminate) the frequency of her spit-ups.  The day after I gave her the first taste of Lickety Stik, she spit up for the first time in a few months.  Perhaps that had nothing to do with it and it was something else, but it did make me wary of treating her with this product too often.<br /><br />Note that the packaging says this product is "All-Natural with Vitamins," that there is only "1 calorie in every 10 licks" and that there are "over 500 licks per bottle."  The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I can see where this product would be an excellent one to use for training purposes or on car trips, when you don't want to have to carry a lot of treats with you.<br /><br />Edited 10/11/11 to add that, after reviewing a couple of other reviews, it appears that the rollerball is SUPPOSED to roll, which was my assumption, but it did not on either of the ones I have used (bacon and liver flavors).  I just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball.  I was able to on one but not the other.  Perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling.  I've been using it about a week.

review/summary: Interesting Dog Treat
review/text: My family has two chihuahuas. I tried the dog treat on the two of them today and got different reactions. The largest chihuahua liked it and the smallest chihuahua did not. This is par to the course and people like different things too.<br /><br />The treat is a liquid that taste like liver. It can be rolled easily anywhere you desire. All you have to do is take the top off and squeeze the sides of container. It is easy to use. It certianly is a new concept as I have always thought of dog treats as something solid.<br /><br />I would recommend it for any dog owner. If you have any questions, ask at this email!

review/summary: Rich bacon smell
review/text: This item seems like a great idea...a convenient, and non-messy way to carry treats for the dog.  It is like a roll-on deodorant container...a bottle of fluid with a rolling ball top that brings the fluid up to the top of the ball as it is spun.  It has a rich, bacon smell smell to it and my little dog (7 lb. Maltese) was interested in it, but I couldn't get him to lick it beyond the first tentative taste.  I think that it was the novel delivery that threw him off, not the taste.  I believe that with a larger dog, where one tongue swipe would clear off and refresh the ball, it might be better received.<br /><br />I'm back after trying this with a larger dog with no success.  He just wanted to take the whole thing in his mouth.<br /><br />This seems like a good idea and it might work if you started using it with a puppy as a training device.  Perhaps you could "train" older dogs to use it properly, but it is certainly NOT worth the effort to do that.

review/summary: Our dog's opinions
review/text: We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary.

review/summary: Novel idea, but needs work
review/text: I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is "Smoky Bacon"<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the "no mess" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only "outside" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product.

review/summary: Three dogs -- not much interest
review/text: I tried this on three dogs, a border collie, a weiner dog, and a little taco dog. Each one showed an interest in only one of the three flavors, bacon being the top contender (two out of the three), as opposed to the chicken and liver flavors. However, the weiner dog (who has no other known allergies) was clearly allergic to this product -- she sneezed every time she licked it so I gave her no more. She has never sneezed like this before.<br /><br />In summary, with all the treats that are available for dogs these days, even though this one is a low-calorie type, I would pass it by. It seems like a good idea but in actuality, I'm pretty sure that you'll be seeing this product on the sale table at Big Lots before too long.

review/summary: My dog liked it, I didn't.
review/text: I usually try to see the good side of things so I'll start with  - my dog liked the taste.  She is an older dog and it takes a lot to get her excited, this did.  As for me, it's messy, and kind of icky when you think about the dog's saliva being put into the bottle every time you roll the ball top.  The top is a roller ball that is very difficult to turn.  You get your fingers sticky with this strong smelling liquid, and it has to be done repeatedly. You can run it along the counter to turn it, also a bad idea. The dog just gets a taste from the ball, then wants to EAT the bottle which, according to the warning label, is a no no.  No eating the roller ball or the bottle!  If they were to get hold of the ball it could choke the dog.  Bad design if you ask me.  OF COURSE the dog is going to want to bite the bottle if it tastes like bacon juice.<br />  I gave her a couple licks and decided to throw the rest away.  Sorry puppy.

review/summary: Two Out of Three Agree!
review/text: I have three dogs. Two of them loved it, one so much that she tried to swallow the whole bottle, or run away with it and rip into it as she might a bone. They were definitely confused by it, they weren't sure what to do with it, but once they caught the smell of bacon they couldn't get enough. The third wasn't so keen on it, but I feel like that was more because he was abused before we took him in and he doesn't like something being held in front of his face like you have to do with this treat. I did eventually get him to try some, but after one lick he refused anymore, I will attribute this to his fear rather than any misgivings he might've had about taste as he eats everything.<br /><br />I think this would work better if you have just one dog. When you pass out treats or food, sometimes squabbles can happen, and that definitely happens here when you're focus is on just one dog and the others get jealous. Also, dogs generally do prefer to grab their treat then be able to go, take it somewhere and spend some time with it, maybe hide it for later, can't really do that with this.<br /><br />This is also drippy, so be careful or you could end up with a bit of a mess.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well this would work for training though. I would probably stick with regular treats for that, but if anyone can test that, please comment and let us know if it worked!<br /><br />Edit: I noticed that my dogs try to go after pill bottles now because the bottles kind of looks like the tube (have a similar shape) so if you get this, might want to watch out for that.

review/summary: New fun treat
review/text: My dog loves this treat. She loves the taste of it and I like that it lasts a while. Other treats just do not last long with her including rawhides but with the Lickety Stik she gets approx 500 licks. She goes nuts every time I go to twist the top off of it and doesn't stop licking until I finally say that she's had enough. With any dog treat some dogs may not like it but I think it's worth a try to purchase Lickety Stik for your dog at least one time. I have found one problem with this treat which is the roller ball doesn't roll so well sometimes. It gets to one point where my dog licks it and it stops turning which annoys her and annoys me as well because I have to get my hands all messy trying to fix the roller. This is the only gripe I have with this treat but it is also why I deducted one star from the overall review.

review/summary: I question its value
review/text: My two dogs do love this product.  The dumb one found it confusing for only a few seconds, and then began licking it happily.<br /><br />The product is physically similar to roll-on deodorant.  The plastic ball works well, and will last the duration of the product.<br /><br />The product doesn't last very long in my experience.  Because the dog is not getting anything to chew, and you are not reaching into a bag of treats, I think most will see a tendency to let the dog get several good licks in.<br /><br />If you're very interested in weight loss without loosing rewards, I suppose this is a clever solution.  Otherwise, this simply is not the best value compared to many other options.

Just whip it out of your pocket and give your dog a lick.  No where on the product did I see the shelf life or how to store it.  I'm assuming it does not need to be refrigerated.  It looks just like a roll-on deodorant bottle.  It's just liver flavored gravy in a deodorant bottle. It's dispensed when the dog licks the ball.  I got the liver flavor. I don't see this lasting very long.  It's a small bottle.  There is a little "window" at the bottom of the bottle so you can see when it's almost empty.<br /><br />I could see these being used for treats in training.  "Chester" says it's great!

review/text: I only have i bottle (bacon flavor), so I don't know if it is typical, but the ball does not roll easily.  My dogs can get the liquid treat, but only if I squeeze the tube a bit.  And they aren't small dogs with weak tongues.  They are a Border Collie and a Labrador Retriever.  They do enjoy the treat, thought the Border Collie is not overly enthusiastic.  The Lab is enthusiastic about anything edible, even remotely, edible.  A bit messy as it drips a little when I squeeze it, but then it's not meant to have to be squeezed.  I will check other reviews and if my hard-to-move roller ball is the exception, I will be ordering more of this handy, portable treat which is easy to keep mess-free in a pocket.

review/summary: The dog likes it, but not over other treats
review/text: Who would have thought that putting stinky smelling liquid dog snack in a deodorant roller ball container would be a good idea - although I have to admit, it's a pretty good idea!  It took my dog about 2 seconds to figure out how to use this thing...just point it at your dog and let them do the licking.  Our dog liked it enough, but when giving the opportunity to either lick this, or eat a liver Bil*Jac, he went for the item that required chewing (albeit only a little chewing).  It works well enough for a quick treat, although I think that in training, it's better and (and faster) to toss my dog a small training treat instead of having to uncap and let him lick the Lickety Stik.<br /><br />On a side note, this stuff smells *really* bad (aka, your dog will like it).  I can't imagine the stench come out anytime soon, should a dog decide to rip it open on a carpet or if it leaked in a car...

review/summary: My Dogs Love It!
review/text: Lickety Stik is an all-natural dog treat that comes in a deodorant-like container with a roller ball on top.  The idea is when your dog wants a treat, you give him a few licks of this lo-cal product instead of something more fattening.  Ten licks = 1 calorie.  I wasn't sure what to think about this product at first--great idea or somewhat odd?  My dogs made the decision for me:  they love it!  In fact, when I picked up the bottle to write this review, they both came running.<br /><br />I think Lickety Stik would be especially useful if your dog is on a diet, or when you're training and don't want to give too many high-calorie treats.  This is a winner at our house.

review/summary: Dogs are undecided!
review/text: I didn't know quite what to think about this dog treat & neither did our Bichon, Biscuit, or our golden Retriever, DJ.  It is exactly like a roller ball on a deodorant bottle.  The dogs have to lick and roll the ball to get the flavor or treat.  DJ finally caught on though it took several licks to get the flavor flowing.  Biscuit still hasn't gotten the hang of licking to roll the ball.  Instead of licking the ball he tries to chew it.  He would get very frustrated when he would get a taste of the gravy, but couldn't lick hard enough to turn the ball.  He finally gave up on it & asked for another kind of treat.  DJ loves it but thought only 20 or so licks wasn't enough & also asked for something more substantial.  I guess it would be good as a treat when training a dog to do tricks or potty train.  It would be a nice reinforcement.  I also like giving the dogs a treat to keep them busy for a while, but this treat takes up my time, as I have to hold it.  I will stick to buying biscuits or other type treats.

review/text: Maybe my doggie is just not smart enough for this product?? I'm not sure. It comes packaged like "Tussy" Deodorant from the old days. You roll it around and the flavor is on the ball and as your dog licks it, the flavor keeps returning. Ok, what did MY dog do? Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just "lick" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange "treat". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus.
