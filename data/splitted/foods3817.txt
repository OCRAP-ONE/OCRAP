review/summary: Excellent, natural chip
review/text: You won't find any MSG, hydrogenated oils, or various things that most people can't pronounce and have no idea what it actually is in these chips.  What you WILL find, however, is a very flavorful chip that has enough flavor for eating plain, but not too much flavor for dipping.<br /><br />While I couldn't really taste a true "olive" flavor, I think that the olives mixed with the garlic salt provides a very subtle flavor that is more robust than plain salted chips.  Of course, not having an overpowering flavor is a good thing...<br /><br />Texture is important with the foods I eat, and these had a nice firm crispness to them.  Other various natural tortilla chips I've tried (including "store brand" Whole Foods chips) have an off-texture (not quite crisp, not quite stale) that have prevented me from repeated buys.  Not the case with these ones.

review/summary: Pretty good, more cracker like than chip
review/text: These are like a cross between a cracker and a tortilla chip.  Its tastes pretty good but has a sort of a little cardboard like texture.  It would work really well as a dip cracker.  For snacking, I prefer the jalape&ntilde;o chips of this brand, they are pretty tasty.

review/summary: you can actually taste the olives . .very unique
review/text: I like these chips just a bit better than I liked the multigrain version.  The flavor here is unique in that you can actually taste the green and black olives - I think they hit just the right balance here, as well, not too much, not too little.  Salt level is good - I don't care for overly salty chips so these are good for me.  Very textured and multi-level flavor in that you can taste the individual ingredients.  I think they'd go well with a mild guacamole or a smooth cheese and some fruit; nothing should compete with the flavor of these chips.

review/summary: DELICIOUS
review/text: I love these chips.  Wonderfully pristine and interesting ingredients.  1-ounce bag, which is perfect to take to work as an emergency snack if there's no time for a lunch break, has 140 calories, 3 grams of fiber, zero trans fats, 7 grams of total fat (a little high but the truth is sometimes higher fat content equals more filling) and a nice and low 2 grams of sugar and equally nice and low 80 mg of sodium.  I will save the bags and recycle with http://www.terracycle.net/ with my energy bar wrappers.  I rarely eat chips because of weight considerations.  These are definitely worth the calories.  But they could be addictive so I've gotta watch it.  Bottom line:  absolutely delicious and crunchy.

review/text: I really like the flavor of these chips/crackers. The sesame seed flavor really pops after a few bites and they aren't dry in your mouth like some other multigrain products. They are a tad stale feeling, but I think that's intended and it doesn't mean they're old. With that said, I enjoyed my first bag. If I see these in a local store I will buy them again.

review/summary: great flavor, but not outstanding
review/text: To sum it up . . I liked these chips, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy them.  That's not a bad thing since I would chose them over other chips- they're just not a 'must have'.  Flavor is good, multi-layered in that you can pretty much taste the individual ingredients - the oat bran, the grains.  Salt level is good.  To compare, Tostitos regular tortilla chips can be extremely salty, whereas these are not.  Flavor is also more dimensional than the Tostitos multi-grain chips (but not that far apart); the ingredients are obviously much better.  They do look nice with their textured nuts and such in them, so they would look much better than your average chip if you were hosting a nice party.

review/summary: Definitely not a tortilla substitute
review/text: Does it matter if things are healthy if they don't taste very good?  This multi-grain chips may be packed with goodness, but they taste like a stale wheat thin that was left sitting in a bag of real tortilla chips for awhile and managed to pick up a bit of their flavor.  I think I would actually like these better if they were simple multi-grain crackers without the thin brushing of flavoring.<br /><br />Someone looking for a healthy alternative might be happy with these.  If you are a compulsive snacker, then maybe you could get used to the taste.  But anyone looking to chow down on some tortilla chips isn't going to be too happy, and would have to force themselves through a bag of these rather than eating what they really wanted.<br /><br />Unless you covered them with cheese and made nachos.  Because that makes everything taste better!

review/summary: "Food Should Taste Good..." Really?
review/text: For a company who's name is "Food Should Taste Good," they certainly do a poor job of practicing what they preach. I bought a couple bags of their lime torilla chips, and wasn't the least bit impressed. Granted, I only bought them because they were so cheap, and that was only because they had been marked 75% off (after being mark 50% off, and 25% off before that). Suffice it to say, it seems that I wasn't the first person to discover their horrible taste, otherwise people would have been buying them more regularly, and the Base Exchange wouldn't have been getting so desperate to get rid of them.<br /><br />Even with a gob of Tostitos cheese dip, the taste of these chips is barely tolerable.

review/summary: Not That Different
review/text: Imagine a small "wheat thin" that tastes like a slightly stale tortilla chip and you get an idea of what this product tastes like.  The caloric intake and the fat, cholesterol, sodium, protein and carbohydrate amounts are similar to other snacks of this type.  The ingredients lists flax, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, brown rice, oat fiber, soy, but the taste is that of a lightly salted tortilla chip.  The word, "Multi-Grain" is a good buzz word for health and this does not contain any Trans fat or other harmful ingredients.  However, I can't say that it's much different than most snack foods on the market other than it is not greasy.  It's not bad, just not different enough to spark my interest.

review/summary: Food Should Taste Good ....
review/text: ... and these do!!<br /><br />Wow!  I was really surprised at how good these chips are.  These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there.  The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right.<br /><br />They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips.  Seems as if other manufacturers feel that in order to get flavor, you have to go heavy on the salt.  Not these.  An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium.<br /><br />For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts.  Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack.  Or how about some light semi-soft cheese, the kind that comes in the little individually-wrapped wedges?  These chips are sturdy enough to serve as light crackers.  Yum!!<br /><br />I'll definitely be purchasing these from Amazon -- I've never seen them in the stores, and I simply must have more of them!

review/summary: Tastes great ... and gets 2-year-old approval
review/text: These multrigrain chips taste like restaurant-quality corn tortilla chips, but they come in individual-sized bags. Most importantly, my two-year-old daughter (who is so picky she hardly eats anything) absolutely LOVES these chips.<br /><br />These chips are technically "multigrain" because they contain yellow corn, brown rice flour, flax seeds, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and soy flour. However, stone ground yellow corn is clearly the main ingredient in these chips and you'll have a hard time picking up the flavor of the other ingredients with your taste buds.<br /><br />The other thing I really like about these chips is that they're flavored with sea salt, which is lower in sodium and (in my opinion) tastes better than regular table salt. With only 140 calories per bag and 7 grams of fat it's hard not to say yes to this tasty treat.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these chips!

review/summary: snack food heaven
review/text: These are wonderful!  They're definitely chocolate, but not overpowering.  The sea salt provides a nice foil, so you can eat a whole bag by yourself without going into a chocolate coma (maybe that's bad).  They're just sweet enough to make the chocolate happen.  They're like "hint of oreo" without all the garbage and without all the guilt (unless you eat a whole bag in one sitting).<br />I've had them with a peach salsa, which was nice.  I think they'd go really well with a fresh fruit salad.  They'd go well with ice cream, and they're perfect with a tart, plain yogurt.  I dipped them in hummus too, and while it doesn't not work...I'm not sure it's great.  Still, basically they're versatile and not too bad for you.  When you find yourself at the bottom of the bag you can always say, "well, at least it wasn't a bag of oreos."

review/summary: Subtle yet sweet tortilla adventure...
review/text: What impresses me first off about this brand "food should taste good" is the fact it is an all natural brand.  They do not use preservatives, trans fats, they are gluten free, Certified Kosher, no Genetic modification etc.  What is even better about all that is it sacrifices all the unhealthy without sacrificing flavor.<br /><br />** CHOCOLATE TORTILLA ** (6oz bags) [5 stars]<br />These Tortilla chips I just had to try.. I mean chocolate Tortilla chips!?  Rather then getting an explosion of sweet sugary chocolate you get this nice, soft subtle taste of chocolate with each crunch of the chip.  These clearly aren't meant for salsa and in fact the back of the bag suggested  to sprinkle them in vanilla ice-cream or better yet... warm the chips up slightly to bring out the flavor.  Both suggestions worked great.  In fact I prefer these to chocolate chips in my ice cream and they probably are far healthier<br /><br />The chips are rectangular in shape and are delightful to eat.  They make for a perfect snack or to help enhance an existing snack; or satisfy the chocoholic in you<br /><br />Definitely a 5 star product with 5 star quality taste.<br /><br />** JALAPENO TORTILLA ** (1.5oz bags) [5 stars]<br />The Jalapeno tortilla chips are outstanding!  I'm a fan of spicy food so I had to test these out for myself.  The chips do not smell spicy at all which means they are spiced properly (not overloaded).  Upon first bite you might not taste much but that is when this chip gets you.  Very quickly a subtle jalapeno flavor kicks in with a bit of nice spice that isn't to overpowering.<br /><br />With the added kick of the chips these would go perfect with a nice mild salsa.  The chips are crispy and fresh, with that nice subtle spice lingering on your taste-buds for a good few minutes so a small 1.5oz bag will last you some time and allow you to savor the flavor.

review/summary: Good try, but tasted stale
review/text: Looking over the ingredients on the bag, I was pretty impressed.  Whole grains, no processed sugar, etc.  And at 140 calories per bag, not too bad in that respect either.  3 grams of fiber and 3 grams of protein isn't too shabby, but with ingredients like quinoa and all the other whole grains, I was a little surprised that it wasn't more.  But maybe I have unreasonable expectations.<br /><br />The only problem was when I stated it.  The chips were hard, and my immediate reaction was that they had gone stale.  They had that 'stale taste' as well, if you know what I mean.  But with the bag just opened that moment, and an expiration date over a year in advance, I'm apt to believe that this is just how they're supposed to be.  The flavor was alright, lightly salty and a little nutty.  But this is probably not the best snack for children, as they will most likely not enjoy the hardness and staleness.

review/summary: FoodDOESTasteGood Multigrain
review/text: These tortilla chips should be renamed to FoodDoesTasteGood!  So many times "healthy" or "good for you" snacks are as flavorless as water.  Good for you, but absolutely boring to the taste buds.  These chips, however break the rules.  No Trans Fat, 0.5% staurated fat. 18g carb, 3g dietary fiber, 2g sugars and 3g protein with only 140 calories per 1 ounce bag w/60 of them from non saturated (good)fats.  Remember, not all fat is bad.  Some fat, like these are needed for digestion and brain function.  The flavor is great.  They are filled with flax seed, whole grains, wheat, but have a crisp, thick feel without grainy flavor.  They have a salty flavor like that of a tortilla, but you don't need a topping or salsa for the flavor.  No itchy lips from to much salt like a regular tortilla and no salsa falling on your clothes!  I eat these just as a quick snack but have served them along with hummus, cheese and veggie sticks for a crowd.  I also toss them into my kids lunch instead of chips or pretzels.  Most of the time they take a couple bags because they share them!  I like the one oz. bags because they tide me over at that 3:00 snack time without letting me indulge with too many.  I've had the Olive and the chocolate, but the multigrain are by far my favorite.  Serve these at your next party, but make sure you have quite a few bags...you will need them.

review/text: Tried these with our homemade chipotle salsa... AMAZING!<br />Great size and shape for dipping. You could go savory or sweet with the dip for sure. The chip is not overly sweet. Very subtle. Great plain out of the bag. We are back for a CASE :-)

review/text: I eat these plain, an ounce at a time, to get my salty-crunchy fix while on WeightWatchers. I think they're pretty darn healthy, and pretty unique. It's not drowning in salt, just enough sea salt to bring out the natural flavors. Honestly they're so good I can't bear to cover them up in any sort of salsa or dip and can't think of any that would both compliment and stay subtle - then again I'm not a huge fan of chips with dips. Just plain chips for me!

review/summary: healthy AND heavenly
review/text: As a weight loss coach, I often talk about quinoa.  The Aztecs called this "the food of the Gods" and it truly is...incredibly healthy and full of vitamins, protein, antioxidants and it's extremely filling. I have gotten many people hooked on it using it as a substitute for rice.  I got these chips (multigrain and the cheddar flavors) simply because I saw good ol' quinoa in the ingredient list but also tons of other good stuff: Stone Ground Yellow Corn, Non-hydrogenated Canola Oil, Brown Rice Flour, Flax Seeds, Turbinado Cane Sugar, Oat Fiber, Sesame Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Quinoa, Soy Flour, Sea Salt, real cheese in the cheddar.<br /><br />But having "good" ingredients doesn't often equate to good taste.<br /><br />It does here.  These are addictive.  I typically buy them at Target or Central Market but it's cheaper to get them here with subscribe and save and no taxLove these...and I actually feel GOOD about putting them in my body. A rarity for a snack.  Bring on the cheddar and I'll sign up for auto delivery.  Try em with hummus.<br /><br />Alternatives: I am also equally addicted to barbecue PoPChips...they are also an all natural snack that's low in fat and calories but highly addictive in my opinion.

review/text: As a big fan of sweet potato fries, I was instantly drawn to these chips when I saw them at the grocery store.  I actually bought a few different varieties of Food Should Taste Good chips because I haven't seen them before and they seemed different than other chips.  I'm trying to eat healthier, but not give up all the things I enjoy eating and chips are one of those things.  This particular chip is a great alternative to the normally greesy fried potato chips and they taste just like sweet potatoes.  Apparently they are a combination of sweet potato and corn, but its still good.  Highly recommended as a snacking alternative to regular chips.

review/summary: Guilt free tortilla-chip snacking pleasure
review/text: Are you the type of person that always needs a side bag of chips to accompany their lunchtime sandwich but then feels pangs of guilt afterward for consuming that extra 120-200 trans-fat laden empty calories? If so, FoodShouldTasteGood's line of nutritious tortilla chips strikes an effective balance between satisfying your junk food cravings while providing some nutritional benefit by way of high quality ingredients and a few grams of fiber to boot.<br /><br />The most important factor though is that with their 'Multigrain' line of tortilla chips (think of a corn tortilla chip that's tasty yet packed with such whole grain goodness like flax, sunflower and sesame seeds as well as oat fiber, brown rice, quinoa and soy - yes please!) the taste itself is good enough to convince the staunchest junk-food addicts to reach into that bag for yet another bite. These chips go well with everything from sandwiches to soups as well as served plain by itself. These chips are tasty enough with the right crisp texture you've come to know and expect from your standard snack tortilla morsel. Great product all around.

review/text: These all-natural multigrain tortilla chips/crackers are very tasty.  Just like the restaurant tortilla chips you nibble on while waiting for your meal, these are slightly salty, crispy, and chewy, and I wanted to keep eating them even when the bag was all gone.<br /><br />The chips are high in fiber and there are only 140 calories per bag, making it a perfect snack.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised--unsalty Frito meets Sasame cracker!
review/text: I have order anxiety:  so when I go to order something I usually panic and blurt out something I didn't really want, or in this case, click the ORDER THESE button on these Multigrain things.<br /><br />Fast forward to today... I studied the bag with this description:<br />TORTILLA CHIPS (it's a cracker, too!) MADE WITH<br />Flax, Sunflower, and Sesame Seeds<br />Oat Fiber, Brown Rice<br />Quinoa, Soy<br /><br />We have pavers that look like the cracker on the front of the bag... and I have no idea what quinoa is, but I tried one.  Hmmm kind of like a not so salty corn chip, with a little sesame seed flavor thrown in.  Just enough salt.  Crunchy, and without the stab-the-roof-of-your mouth shards.  Nice mingling of flavors...can't say I know what flax seed tastes like, but I think I like it now!  I like them.  I really like them!!<br /><br />The ingredients list is:  Stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flour, flax seeds, turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt. Not a bad ingredients list!  For one 1 oz bag, 140 calories, 60 from fat.  And each cracker feels like you are eating something, not like a bite of air in a salt-laden wafer.<br /><br />I could seriously go for more of these now.  They would be fantastic with a slice of mild cheddar or something really different with a creamy artichoke dip.  Lots of possiblities, and still good right out of the bag.  They say they are available at your local supermarket or grocer--really, I am going to get more of these, they are that good!

review/summary: Tastes the way it looks.
review/text: The actual product is exactly what it is described as - a hybrid of a chip and a cracker.  Some pieces tasted more like a cracker and others more like a tortilla chip - either way it was pretty good but I think the saltier pieces were better tasting.  It took a few pieces to get used to the taste and texture since it's really not quite like any other snack I've had.  The pieces are very thin and light like a tortilla chip, but they're also textured and grainy like a cracker.<br /><br />After the first 4 or 5 chips I decided I did like the taste and texture and easily munched down the rest of the bag.  The bag is a small 1 oz of 140 calories and seems to have as many chips as one of those 100-Calorie packs.  This would be a refined alternative to Baked Lays.

They have an artisan quality in that they are the exact opposite of processed chips that all taste the same. I munched my sample bag down in mere seconds and decided to buy the full size package from Amazon. They get 4 stars instead of 5 to reflect the high cost per ounce.

review/summary: Average Chip, Good Ingredients.
review/text: Not too bad. It is similar to the stone ground or multigrain chips out there. The smaller size should not fool you because it's still sold by weight. I liked them more for snacking because of this. The smaller size is not as hot for dip or salsa holding. Not too salty, for sure. Had a fairly low sodium content for a chip even.<br /><br />Earthy with a touch of salt is perhaps the best way to describe it.<br /><br />The ingredients are what make this. Simple, nothing crazy or 8 syllables. It is not like eating cardboard or styrofoam, just good stuff. If you've ever made corn chips with rough meal from scratch, this has a similarity in texture and quality.<br /><br />Lastly it arrived nicely packaged from Amazon. I did not have a bag of crumbs but intact chips. Something that is always a plus with products like this.

review/summary: Delicious.....You'll like this so much you'll want the BIG bag
review/text: Well, the manufactures of the Multigrain, FoodShouldTasteGood, tortilla chip has succeeded in their claim.....this chip does taste good.  The one ounce bags are perfect for on the go and the "mini" version allows the consumer to pop the entire chip in the mouth with no mess.  The packaging looks (dare I say it) more sophisticated and "adult like" so you won't feel embarrassed to tote one around in your brief case (no orange tigers lurking around with artificial colors or flavors).  This blend between a chip and cracker taste quite good all in its own right but it is also great with dips and cheese.  I really enjoyed it and hoped the kids would hate it so that I'd have more for myself.....sadly, not the case.  This multigrain chip was a hit.

review/text: I had just taken a Freshly made Spinach, Feta, Olive Tomato Quiche out of the oven when these Olive tortilla chips arrived!<br />Talk about perfect timing....anyways we broke open a bag & I served the quiche with a choice of these & buttered toast crisps...........they ate all the chips & asked for MORE!<br /><br />As I was serving 2 slightly different variations in the quiches, 1 with parmesan & less spinach & one with more spinach & different tomatoes, I asked which did they like the best........they all said the CHIPS!!! I should have just served the Olive Tortilla Chips & saved myself all the work! LOL<br /><br />These REALLY are that good! I have never tasted any that come close & Tortilla chips are a staple in our house, as we have them with salsa over cottage cheese, I make an awesome beans, rice, salsa, cheese, & sour cream dish we serve with tortilla chips etc....<br /><br />As there are only 140 calories per 1 oz bag: 7g fat, 18g carbs & 2g protein,  a bag of these with a cup of low fat cottage cheese & salsa is a low carb (ZONE type) meal or snack (depending on your appetite!!<br /><br />The flavor of the olives is WONDERFUL, with just a hint of garlic.......they are a fabulous combination, I will definitely be buying more, & for the record, the children who had these were all boys, ages 10,12 & 15. They wanted more immediately, but they will have to wait for an Amazon order as you cannot buy these locally here where I live..............:-(

review/summary: Delicious and healthy tortilla chips
review/text: I have been on a quest for a number of years now to eat foods that provide good nourishment to my body without sacrificing taste and satisfaction.  I immediately loved these chips when I tried them -- sometimes "healthy" foods have to grow on you, but not so with these chips.  They come in a nice little pentagon shape, and there are about 16 chips in the bag, which is just right for a snack or to combine with a sandwich for lunch.  If you are watching your calories and fat, it is great that they list the nutritional information for the whole bag and not for 1/2 bag like some companies do.  All the ingredients in these chips are ones that you see on those lists of "healthy foods you should be eating."  All the flavors meld together to make a really nice, rich flavor that is ever-so-slightly sweet, and you get a light taste of flax and sesame seeds.<br /><br />I compared the label with Doritos Toasted Corn Tortilla Chips, and these Multigrain Chips have 3 times the fiber, 2/3 the sodium, 1/2 the saturated fat, and of course the much healthier ingredients, with no trans fats.<br /><br />These are the best chips of the many I have tried that use healthy ingredients, and I'll be definitely ordering more of them.

They're sweet but extremely low in sugar--about 2g. You get 20% of your vitamin A in one serving which isn't bad for a snack.  I bought these for my son for the holidays--he loves sweet potatoes. He enjoyed these. These are much healthier than potato chips and are just as tasty if you like sweet potatoes.

review/summary: Amazing flavorful chip!
review/text: I saw these on display at my supermarket and tried them on a whim.  Boy am I glad I did!  They are spicy and flavorful.  I would describe them as a medium hot; the heat kicks in after you've eaten a few, but it's not too hot.  They are so excellent with just plain sour cream -- it's hard to stop!  They are also sturdy enough and big enough to use as a cracker if you want to top them with cheese slices or relishes.<br /><br />Buying a case on Amazon saved me $1.00 per bag compared to the grocery store.  And, thank you Amazon for placing the case inside of another box before shipping.  They arrived in perfect condition -- no crumbs!  I think I'll go have some more...

review/text: How could a chip get better than the Food Should Taste Good chips? I love the distinct, natural flavor that's built into the chip, balanced with the perfect amount of sea salt sprinkled on the outside.<br />These are whole-grain, high-quality, no-junk, full-o'-flavor...and the bag looks stylish, besides.<br /><br />Highly recommended! Easy to eat the whole bag - but you actually feel OK even if you do (woops). (I had no sugar rush, only a very slight chocolate rush, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.)<br /><br />Seal of approval from Lovejoy Fitness -- http://lovejoyfitness.com.

review/text: AMAZING chips.  I picked them up at Whole Paycheck, and as soon as I'd had a few, I ran to Amazon to see if I could buy them by the carton!<br /><br />I believe I have never tasted a better chip of any sort.<br /><br />They're lighter and crisper than the usual kinds of tortilla chips that come in brown paper bags, and they have the taste of olive oil, black pepper, salt and olives.<br /><br />I ate them right out of the bag, but I could see them working well with some kinds of pate or hummus, too.<br /><br />The main down side:  one 6oz bag contains 840 calories, and they're quite addicting.

review/summary: YUM, Chips...!
review/text: Not optimistic about the taste of healthy chips I was expecting these to taste roughly like chewing a cardboard box. Boy was I surprised and delighted! These chips taste like a cross between a salty Frito and Sun Chips. With no trans fat, no cholesterol, no crazy preservatives to make them look good after months on the shelf. And even though they taste so yummily salty there's only 80 mg of sodium. Compare that to your average chip! I'd definitly eat these again.

review/summary: Tasty Snack
review/text: I am munching on these chips as I type, trying to keep the salt off my fingers and from going on the keys. I like the way they taste. The flavors are mainly of stone-ground corn, but you can tell there are other ingredients, as well. There's a nice nutty aftertaste. I like texture, too. Just the right amount of crunch.  These chips aren't overly salty, either, another plus.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise, these chips rank among the more healthy versions.  There are only 140 calories in a one ounce serving, a lot less than the normal 200+ I see on similar products, and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower, too. It's got 3g of fiber = 11% of an average daily requirement. There are no trans fats cholesterol, preservatives, etc.  It seems that the FoodShouldTasteGood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good.<br /><br />One reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale.  My own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip.  The expiration date on the bag is in November.  With no preservatives, it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away.<br /><br />My only hesitation would be the price.  Currently these chips aren't in stock on Amazon and there is no pricing given so I would say you'd have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips, even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good, as well.

review/summary: Interesting chip, but maybe not the best for salsa
review/text: These tortilla chips have an "all-natural" feel to them, and a somewhat unique taste, which is both good and bad.<br /><br />First off, I'll just comment on the packaging.  The singular bag is made of a relatively thick foil-like material and is air puffed tightly.  The result is freshly crisp, unbroken chips in the bag.  A nice bonus and much better than standard lunch-sized chip bags you find from most common companies.<br /><br />As for the taste of the chips, they're pretty good.  I liked the olive and garlic flavor when I was eating them by themselves.  However, when I paired them with some salsa, the olive taste didn't match up that well.  They might go better with a french onion chip dip instead (though I didn't try that).<br /><br />So if you want fresh, never-broken tortilla chips to eat just by themselves with no dip, these do rather well.  If you're looking for a chip to go with your bowl of salsa, you may want go elsewhere.

review/summary: Very nice chip, even better ingredients.
review/text: A good chip, though some folks might be put off. The olive flavor comes from real olives put into the mix. So this means some chips are -Olive- flavor, and some are just a hint of olive flavor.<br /><br />Personally, this was a sizable plus. Not a every tidbit crunched is the same kind of flavor chip.  If you need something more standardized in the way of flavor you're going to want to look elsewhere.  I liked these better than the multigrain to be sure. Still only 4-stars because it didn't -wow- me the way I want a 5-star product to reflect in my reviews. The smaller chip size should not fool you because it's still sold by weight.<br /><br />It arrived nicely packaged from Amazon,  I did not have a bag of crumbs but intact chips. Something of a plus with products like this.<br /><br />To sum up. Wonderful flavor overall, but don't expect every chip to taste the same.

review/summary: multigrain taste and not too salty; too bad they are fried and not baked
review/text: While I enjoyed eating these chips, I doubt I would order them again.  The positives are that they are not too salty and they have a good, multigrain taste.  (I suppose this latter quality might be a minus for some who don't like the taste of whole grains.)  The negatives are that a fairly small serving size (one ounce) has 7 grams of fat because these chips are fried, not baked.  So while these are made using whole grains that aren't genetically modified, I'd hesitate to call them a healthful snack because of the high fat content.

review/text: I absolutely loved this snack!  If you like olives, you will too.  The taste of olives is just right, not to strong and not too subtle.  The reason I don't just like this snack, but love it, is because I'm a label reader and don't buy products with lots of ingredients that I can't pronounce.  These cracker/chips have no trans fat and only a handful of ingredients that you'd have in your kitchen.

review/summary: Not good for some dog's stomach
review/text: Apparently the "New and Improved" ziggies are not so good for some dogs.  When I started giving my dogs the ziggies (The old style with no filling) she loved and her stomach was stable.  This "new and improved" ziggies gives my dogs' violent diarrhea.

review/summary: Our dog loves them, but the aftermath isn't pretty!
review/text: We have a large mixed-breed dog who loves to chew. Her ability to demolish toys is almost comical, so we are always looking for a way to entertain/occupy her that isn't going to drive us into bankruptcy.<br /><br />She loves her Kong, but I hate cleaning it after it has had peanut butter in it. So, when I saw these I thought they would be a perfect solution! Something she would have to put a little work into that wouldn't result in a big mess to clean up afterward.<br /><br />I was right...sort of. She loves them. They only keep her occupied for about 10 minutes but that's more than can be said for most of her toys. However, about an hour after she has one she gets the worst gas she has ever had. I'm not talking the occasional smelly fart. Last night I went upstairs and thought something had died in my bedroom because the smell was so terrible. It took me 15 minutes to realize the smell was coming from the dog and wasn't going away. I can only imagine the discomfort she must be in to be producing that much gas.<br /><br />Unfortunately as much as our dog enjoys them, I'm fairly certain they don't like her and I don't think I can handle the resulting gas storm.

review/summary: Kong treats
review/text: The concept is a good one. Stuff a treat into a rubber toy, and let the dog figure out how to get to the prize. Should keep Fido busy for hours unless like our dogs he loses patience and gives up. After having to remove the Ziggies ourselves most of the time, we've given up and now give the remaining Ziggies to one of our dogs as a snack.<br /><br />Good: Made in the USA. Piper likes them. Doesn't make our dogs sick. Soft  enough for a dog with four missing teeth like our Piper. NO meat-by-products<br /><br />Not so good: First two ingredients are ground wheat and gelatinized wheat starch. However, there is chicken meal in there too.<br /><br />Finally - As a treat choice this isn't bad because there are far worse choices out there. As entertainment paired with a Kong, it hasn't worked too well for us. It might work for you.

review/summary: Not a good fit for my dog
review/text: To put it simply, my dog gives up too easy. I bought a package of these thinking it would be easier and less messy than filling the Kong with a food/peanut butter mix and freezing it. Little did I know that my options with these Ziggies were either too easy or too difficult for my dog. If I inserted it into the Kong with just a little bit sticking out she would get the whole thing out very easily and it would be gone in 2-3 minutes. This totally negates the concept of it occupying her over time. Whoever said that a dog won't give up on food until it gets it never met my lab. If I wedged the Ziggie all the way inside the Kong she would give up after trying for 5-10 minutes and walk away from it leaving me to pry it out with a knife. After two tried I ended up feeding the rest of them to her as treats. She enjoyed them very much but the price point is too high to use them in that capacity. Not all dogs are the same and others will probably have more favorable results but I did not.

review/summary: Not worth it
review/text: I bought these as an easy solution to filling the kong toy.  I typically fill the kong with chicken & peanut butter but figured I can save some time cooking chicken with this product.<br /><br />It fit really snugly in the kong toy. Maybe I bought the wrong size?  The package says it fits medium and large kong toy (I have a medium). My dog was only able to eat the tip of the treat and could not get the treat inside the kong.  Using a knife, I managed to wedge it out and gave the rest of the treat (not in the kong) to my dog.<br /><br />A few hours later...my dog had smelly gas and eventually, my dog had diarrhea...<br /><br />I decided not to feed the rest of the package to my dog but did not throw out the package.  A few weeks later, my husband, not knowing the product caused stomach upset in our poor dog, decided to feed the Ziggie to our dog.  Our dog is currently being crate-trained (only a 3 hours a day when we are out).  Lets just say, she had diarrhea inside her crate.  After a few hours of cleaning, bathing, and throwing away a new dog bed and blanket, I'm writing this review.<br /><br />Now, granted, there is a chance that it may have been something else that caused her stomach upset (I feed her premium dog food and limit her treats, and never give her table scraps)BUT she only had the issue the two times we gave her this treat. I'm not going to risk a third time.

review/summary: Not totally pleased
review/text: When I bought these treats for my dog I was hoping for, as most people are, an easy and mess free way to give my dog his/her Kong toy. That is exactly what I got.. kind of.<br /><br />Yes, my dog does love the taste of these treats, and they fit well inside my large Kong. The problem is that the treat either ends up stuck inside the Kong, inaccessible to the dog, or the dog pulls the entire treat out at once and eats it.<br /><br />I'm not totally satisfied with this product. It keeps my dog entertained for a little while but this treat doesn't fully work as intended. I will not buy this product again.

review/text: These Ziggies are great to stuff the Kong.  My dog hates his crate, so it keeps him very busy trying to get it out.<br />Sometimes it takes him hours.

review/summary: Sitting here feeling grateful
review/text: I felt compelled to write my very first Amazon review as a result of sitting here, getting my work done, observing my puppy run back and forth across the room with a Ziggie-stuffed Kong in his mouth.  I am currently overseas and do not have access to many dog treats, but I happened to bring a bag of these and am so grateful that I did.  My 11-month old puppy is unbelievably food-motivated and perseverant, and this has kept him busy for 1-2 hours on several occasions.  Because we have a limited supply, I had to figure out ways to ration the Ziggies, so I've actually cut them into four pieces, and give him a fourth every week or so when he's got more energy than a walk and fetch session will take care of.  I put peanut butter on the sides and then stuff the piece as far into the Kong as it will go, to the point where I struggle to get it out even with a tool (chopstick!).  Then I hide the Kong, so he needs to spend time tracking it down, and then he lies there working it for OVER AN HOUR.  He'll sometimes stop to nap while working on it, then wake up to continue, with not a single concern for what I might be doing during that time.  For dogs who will not give up pursuing even the smallest morsel of food, the 1/4th Ziggie + Kong combination is just brilliant.  Don't get overzealous though and break it up any further; I tried to cut it into fifths and wasted one whole Ziggie as a result.  I think that I'll continue to only give him a fourth even when we return to the States because he can pull the full ones out in just a couple minutes, and this method costs a fourth the price.<br /><br />Puppy just stopped for a water break, and now he's back to work!  =)

review/summary: My dogs enjoy these!
review/text: I give these to my dogs about twice a month. They really enjoy them and it entertains them for awhile. For added enjoyment, I also put some peanut butter in the kong. My (smart) dog is done with it in about 10 minutes, but it takes my other dog (not too bright) awhile for her to finish it.<br />I like to use these on rainy days or days when I am super busy and we don't make it to the dog park.

review/summary: Doggie Approved
review/text: My dog seems to really like these. I'm sure they're not the healthiest dog treat out there, but hey we all splurge sometimes. For some reason he won't eat the KONG while we're away from home, at work. But once we're home and he's had his walk he usually goes and finds his KONG and carries it out to the mat at the front door to enjoy his treat! I sometimes add peanut butter to it or plain yogurt. He digs it, the only problem is my dog gives up too easy. If the Ziggie breaks off leaving half of it too far for him to reach it, he's over it. He'll just leave it there, leaving me to have to dig it out for him later.
