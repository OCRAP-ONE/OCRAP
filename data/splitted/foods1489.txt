review/summary: Just okay...not exactly what I hoped for
review/text: I have been on a quest to find a really good hot cocoa mix. After sifting through many types and reviews I decided to try this one. Sadly, this mix is kind of blah...it is not bad but not anything better than what I buy at the supermarket. I like cocoa that is rich, mildly sweet with a hint of saltiness. I did not find this mix rich at all (yes, I followed the directions) and did not detect any salt, it was mildly sweet--maybe minimally would be more accurate. Perhaps, after trying it a couple more times the taste will grow on me? I will say it does have a uniqueness about it. All and all, I have to say that I would not suggest this product.

review/summary: Not white tea. Heavy on the cloves.
review/text: I should have read the description better.  The ingredients list is accurate, I just didn't read it before ordering.  My bad.  It's not white tea with orange and cloves, it's white peony with orange, cloves and some other ingredients.  If you are looking for a white tea blend, keep looking.  However, it is good tea.  It's a little heavy on the cloves for my taste.  I bought two different teas from this company and the package on the other one resealed just fine.  The zipper seal on my particular bag of this, doesn't reseal properly. No big deal. I am happy with the packaging overall.

review/summary: Great packaging and taste
review/text: These taste great. One thing I really like is that inside one package there are six smaller wrappings of the crackers, so I can eat just a few crackers without worrying about the others going stale if I don't eat them soon. These are gluten, lactose, soy and preservative free. They also have some calcium and iron. The ingredients are potato starch, rice flour, buckwheat flour, eggs, palm oil, modified corn starch, dextrose, salt, yeast, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sunflower lecithin, cream of tartar, ammonium bicarbonate, natural flavor.

review/summary: Schar Table Crackers Gluten Free
review/text: I am new to gluten free foods.  I was diagnosed with celiac disease in March.  I have been searching for a "normal tasting" saltine cracker.  This is as close as it comes.  These crackers are delicious<br />with almost all my new gluten free diet foods.  I am so glad I found them.  I will continue my orders as long as these crackers are available.  Thanks Amazon!

review/text: These gluten free crackers are very good, and this was a reorder of the product for me--so I obviously like these crackers.  However, the shipping needs to be improved, as too many of the crackers are broken upon arrival.  The product, both times I received it, was soft-packed on just one side, and I believe this is what causes the breakage.

review/summary: Nice GF Cracker
review/text: My 8 year old gf son and I give these cracker 2 thumbs up.  I doubt I will eat them by themselves, unless I'm sick, but with topping they are yummy.  The texture is like a thick saltine.  They do not break on the pre-dotted line.  They have a mind of their own and break in unique pieces each time.  I was pleasantly surprise to find 6 individual sealed sets of crackers in each package.  Each set has 6 crackers in it.  GF foods can go stale quickly so individually sealing these crackers is a great idea.

review/summary: Less expensive locally
review/text: I never buy food online unless I've tried it first.  So I tracked down a package of Schar's table crackers at the grocery store, loved them and decided to order more from Amazon.  Except I can buy three packages here for $16.47 instead of $20.49...PLUS shipping.  That's the first time this has happened and I'm a little surprised.<br /><br />As for the crackers themselves?  They are wonderful!  No rice cake texture like all of the others I've tried.  There's a little more to them than regular saltines but that's fine with me.  The flavor and texture remind me of the real things.<br /><br />If it makes some of the other purchasers feel better, this package also has a number of broken crackers.  I don't mind though.  The taste is worth it to me.  :)

review/summary: Didn't think I would ever eat crackers again!
review/text: I truly love these crackers. I didn't think I would ever be able to eat crackers again. I eat them with chicken salad, but can also eat them with anything one would normally eat crackers. I actually like these better than saltine crackers and Ritz; they are not as salty and not as sweet. I originally purchased these from Sunflower Market, but am happy to see that I can get them from Amazon for less. Haven't tried any other Schar products, but am now willing to try. They break easier than mainstream crackers, but don't crumble in your hands. I think their delicateness adds to the "freshness".<br /><br />UPDATE 03/15/12: The price has gone up by $6 since I made my first order a little over a month ago; they are now $20.06. I may have to find a different source.

review/summary: Clean tasting green tea
review/text: I am sipping on my first cup of Oothu green tea from Davidson's right now.  My first impressions are that Oothu green is a very clean tasting green tea.  I like to brew my tea very strong, and I don't detect any harsh or overwhelming grassy flavors. Visually, the tea looks of high quality, with very few stems.  The loose leaf tea has a slightly spiced aroma.  Overall, this seems to be a tremendous value.  16 oz is a lot of loose leaf tea!<br /><br />UPDATE 06.08.10<br />I just re-ordered the tea, and I wanted to note that Davidson's improved the packaging.  Rather than the packaging that is pictured, the product now comes in a resealable ziplock-type, foil-lined paper bag.  This type of packaging is ideal for tea and undoubtedly improves the freshness of the product.  I increased my rating by a star.  In my mind, this is the best deal in loose-leaf organic green tea!

Here is the thing: The green tea, no matter how the grade they are, the frashness is the most important. Low end green tea if they produced within one year they still have good vitamin even their taster is not so good. If they exposed in air more than one year, the vitamin get oxidazed, even the good grade tea become worthless. Unfortunately these tea didn't wrapping in the air tight package, loose like made in last century.

review/text: I have been burned by one of the Davidson's teas in the past (Green chai with orange peel - blech!) but this is a very drinkable, albeit very strong, green tea.  It has a pronounced "vegetal" flavor without yielding the bitter green taste you can occasionally get from a gunpowder green.  I drink this as an everyday green and I'm very pleased with it - just be conservative with both the amount of tea and brew time to avoid an over-the-top taste.

review/summary: Third Grade Tea, Not High Quality
review/text: How you view this tea depends on what you are used to.<br /><br />If you are used to drinking high grade green tea, say for example from the first grade of organic green tea from Tenren,<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />or the Special grade, which is above the first grade, then you will find this tea very lacking in flavor and in the delicate qualities that make a fine green tea.<br /><br />If however, you are comparing it to green tea bags from almost anybody, well then it is a considerable step up.<br /><br />But be aware that this is not a high grade tea.  There are many broken leaves, and in fact, I don't see any whole leaves.  I think this is equivalent or worse than what TenRen and other tea sellers refer to as a Third Grade tea, and correspondingly, the price is no particular bargain.

review/text: These peppers have good color, aroma, and taste. I ordered a pound and am quite pleased with the amount of product per dollar. We use green peppers for many things: poaching salmon, flavoring corned beef, ground in salads, etc. So far I've found the peppers competitive with any other green peppers I've bought and they are less expensive to boot.

review/text: What a surprise! The truffle salt  I ordered was cheaper than it is at my local Whole Foods. It arrived so fast that I could not understand what could possibly be in the package! It said Paul Butler in the return address, which gave me no clue. What wonderful treats are in store for me! I will toast some good bread, spread a nice helping of smoothly mashed avocado to which I have added a soup�on of lemon juice and a slight sprinkle of the truffle salt.  Some black bread, even untoasted, is good this way! I look forward to the next delivery that says Paul Butler in the return address . A great seller!

review/text: Durkee Garden Seasoning is impossible to find locally, so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon.<br /><br />My vegetarian husband loves this mix, which has a nice blend of onion, herb and spicy dried peppers. He uses it on tomato soup, salads, mashed potatoes, many things that need a little extra zing but no extra salt.<br /><br />I've also used it in cold pasta salad for a little extra flavor.<br /><br />A great option for vegetarians, or folks who need a low-salt diet.

review/text: I used to hear how coconut oil is so unhealthy for you.  But thank God for the internet and objective researchers.  Perhaps if a coconut oil has been refined and adulterated and hydrogenated it will be unhealthy, but raw, virgin coconut oil is one of the best things in the world for you.  I use this product not only in my diet but for skin and health care as well.  Think about it, how could a fruit that grows from the earth for our benefit be unhealthy?  This Nutiva product is a godsend and I will make sure to keep a steady stock of it from now on.  Just check out the several books out there touting the benefits of virgin coconut oil and you'll see what I mean.

review/text: the island girls rave about it. And it's  Virgin Organic Coconut oil. I've been using it for a couple of years now and nothing moisturizes me after a shower like this stuff. It's a multipurpose product that can be used in the kitchen and the bathroom. For now, we're just going to focus on uses in the bathroom. I use it on my hair- particularly the ends, my face at night, and my whole body after a shower. Coconut oil is great for locking in moisture,  it's very light, and has easy absorption (even with oily skin like mine), but you won't believe the other benefits....<br /><br />see the rest of the review here: [...]

review/text: The product is very good, but the dealer I was buying from is unreliable. Be very careful with which dealer you are buying from. There are many companies sell this product at Amazon,I ordered this product twice from the same supplier. First time, after my credit card was charged for a month, I did not receive my order. I had to read a letter to inquiry about it, and they did send my order after that. The second time, I ordered two twin packages-total four bottles, they only sent half of my order-two bottles, but charged me for four bottles price. I wrote letters to the dealer through Amazon to complain about this, the dealer did give me the credit back and offer to send me the other two bottles at free of charge. It has been a few weeks, I have not receive it. I have been ordering from Amazon for many years, these are the only two incidents with the same dealer happened to me. I am just glad that I ordered this product through Amazon and did not order directly from the dealer.

review/summary: The quintessential breakfast tea.
review/text: Given this blend's orgin, the name "English" Breakfast is a bit of a misnomer, because it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name "breakfast tea." It proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over Britain, many of which then added the word "English," which has been part of its name ever since.<br /><br />English Breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and China. Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday "work horse," and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee.

review/summary: A straight-ahead pleasure
review/text: This Twinings tea is a simple pleasure that never offends. It is sturdy enough to be enjoyed with milk or sweetener, yet has little harshness when consumed black.<br /><br />Twinings of London was founded in 1706, and is known internationally for marketing teas of consistency and value. Twinings English Breakfast Tea was originally blended to complement the traditional, hearty English Breakfast, from which its name derives. Twinings literature tells us that this is a blend of Kenyan and Assam black teas.<br /><br />This Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses only small particles that infuse more quickly than whole leaves. This blend approaches full strength within just a couple minutes. To avoid excessive particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. (Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.)<br /><br />This product is an attractively priced and enjoyable introduction to the world of loose tea. Would I rank it as my favorite tea or even my favorite Twinings? No, but I keep some available for when I want the pleasure of plain ol' tea. (As an aside, I would rank Twinings' Earl Grey a bit higher in quality. It is a whole leaf tea with just the right amount of bergamot orange flavoring. I personally don't think of Earl Grey as an everyday tea, but I enjoy it as an occasional pleasure.) I wish you pleasure in exploring various teas.

review/text: My husband loves black tea.  He was raised on it and drinks about 3-5 cups a day.  For years, he would drink Lipton or Tazo Awake.  That was until his friend introduced him to Twinings English Breakfast.  One cup and he was hooked.  It has a great, smooth flavor that isn't bitter like other teas.  Once his eyes were opened to better quality teas, he started trying many others (some that were quite expensive) - none have compared to Twinings.<br /><br />He used to use the tea bags.  But, last year, we got a Keurig and ordered the Twinings K-cups.  After a while, it got far too costly.  So, we got the loose leaf tea to use in our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FKRTO0">Ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown/Green, 3-Count</a>.  It works great.

review/summary: Best Tea Ever
review/text: Once upon a time we drank coffee.  We bought the best beans, ground our own beans, brewed each cup or pot carefully using good water, until we had the flu.  After two weeks of being too sick to function very well, we felt good enough to brew some of the coffee we had missed so much; it tasted like ****.  We had grown out of our coffee addiction, but still needed something hot to drink.<br /><br />We reverted to tea, but Lipton was never that good.  We discovered this tea (Twinings English Breakfast Tea) and started our day with this kick off.  We have tried and enjoy many teas, but this is the one we always come back to and use to start most days.<br /><br />We do not use the English method to brew tea; it takes too long and does not seem to make that big a difference.  instead we brew our tea bu using a standard American Coffee Maker (Like a Mr. Coffee).  We find that using one to two teaspoons of tea per 10 to 12 (coffee cup measure) cups of water gives a very good brew.<br /><br />Biggest plus is that this is a great price for a great tea that we already enjoy.  The closest stores that sell this tea are about 25 to 50 miles away, so it was drive there and then spend 2 to 3 bucks more per can for this size.  HUM, drive and pay more or get home delivery at a lower price?  Well...

review/summary: Great tea, great price
review/text: I first bought this tea while on a trip to England several years ago and have been drinking it ever since.  Once you try it, you'll never go back to tea bags.  I've occasionally tried other brands of loose English breakfast tea, but I always go back to Twinings because it has such a wonderful flavor.

review/summary: Makes great iced tea
review/text: I go through a ton of iced tea in the summer and I brew it in a Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Pot.  Twinings English (or Irish) Breakfast Tea tastes great!  About four tablespoons in a coffee filter (with the top twisted shut and a second filter placed upside-down over it in the Pot) is juuuust right!  Much more economical to use loose tea than tea bags.  I've been buying it from here for the past couple of years.

review/text: I'm very picky about tea, having grown up in India, and despaired of a good cup before I tried Twinings. I've never looked back. This is the tea I use to make 'chai' (tea with milk) and all my Indian friends have been surprised at how good this tastes. I won't recommend this leaf for tea without milk, though; a tad too strong for that.

review/text: Of course nothing beats homemade (although my attempt at a homemade cream of broccoli wasn't as good as store bought in my opinion, I can't do a good cream soup :|). However, this is a pretty good example of a great soup mix. It's got a nice flavor, but of course it's a nice idea to add a few extra ingredients - shred in some sharp cheddar and cut up some fresh broccoli, maybe add some corn in too. They stopped selling these at the store I shop at so I'm glad to see them up here!

You add milk and water and wallah!!  Instant cheddar Broccoli Soup.  HOWEVER, if you're like me and you love broccoli, I would honestly suggest you add some more.  It's light with the broccoli pieces, which if you're like my HUBBY he was very happy with the way it is without adding anymore (not a broccoli person at all but he even liked this soup!!).  I also tossed in a little more cheddar cheese after I fixed this and YUMMERS!!  It was pretty darn good.<br /><br />Give it a try, You'll enjoy it!!  With a little additional it becomes a 5-Star!!

Other than having a problem with the lid at first, this popper has been great! I had to bend the lid a little to keep it shut during popping. Once doing that it was fine. I use only white popping corn cooked in peanut oil, then sprinkle with a little sea salt. Very yummy and very popular with all my friends.

review/summary: Love Love Love this stuff!
review/text: I bought Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil from a local natural foods market after reading so many good reviews on Amazon.com and the many uses for this awesome oil on the internet. The first thing I did was put some in my dry hair to absorb for a few hours. After shampooing, my hair was MUCH softer than it was before. I've put few drops on my ends 2 more times since then and my hair is soooo soft now! In that time, I've used it as a face and body moisturizer and it does NOT make my dry acne prone face break out. Be careful though, coconut oil is not a thick oil so a little goes a loooong way (which is a great thing!). Smells SO good on my skin, gives it a slight, mild toasted coconut smell.<br />I've cooked eggs, kielbasa and pulled pork with it so far and it makes the tastes of those things richer, which is a pleasant surprise. No overpowering coconut taste, just a slight "ummph" to the flavor of things I've cooked so far with it.<br /><br />I even like licking the spoon after I've dipped it in the container to get some oil.<br /><br />Right now, I keep it on my kitchen counter in a cruet (oil drizzler) and it is liquid which is fine by me. Will start solidify below 75 degrees though so don't be alarmed if your clear oil starts to become cloudy every once in awhile.<br /><br />I purchased one 15 oz. jar from my local health food store for $9.99 so 2 for $12.17 is a great deal! Will purchase again :)

review/summary: Near Perfect for popcorn, experimental for other things
review/text: Edit:  Added a second part.<br />===============================================<br />Original Post<br />I use this with the whirleypop, which I'm expecting to break any minute, but that aside, this makes near perfect popcorn.  The coconut taste is a little bit stronger than what you'd find in movie theatres but overall a bit bland (which is not a bad thing).  I frankly prefer that than trading the health benefits for overly processed oil.  That and while I love coconut trading the near tasteless flavor of the oil for a strong coconut flavor would reduce it's versatility in cooking.<br /><br />So when you salt this lightly with popcorn it stands on its own.  But I season mine with kernel's seasons, splenda, sugar, some salty butter flavoring along with melted Nutiva, mixed then drizzled on top.  In short, it's one step short of heaven and the switch from Canola is immediate and amazing.  I honestly can't stop eating it and it is rather healthy in comparison to movie theatre popcorn as I use far less and still has a very similar oil fragrance and taste.  Yes I still treat it like an oil and use about 2.5 to 3 tablespoons for a 1/3 cup of unpopped corn.<br /><br />On that note, while I applaud the brave reviewers out there who put this on their hair, and eat it religiously daily this is still an oil.  Perhaps a high quality one and one I may put on my split ends one day, but to me this is a yummy cooking oil you use in moderation.<br /><br />It also is a tad expensive (hence subbing a star) and again I do find it too bland to use alone on toasted bread (perhaps it has to be toasted together in the toaster oven) but the quality and convenience is really good.<br /><br />So if you happen to use it in other ways, good on you but I am happy with using it sparingly, and simply for popcorn.  It seems much more useful to me than using it as the latest and greatest in health fads today.  Especially because oil, even when healthy, contributes a hefty amount of calories and fat to your diet.<br /><br />==========================================================<br />Note about the Coconut Oil Hype<br /><br />Seems like a few people are very into the hype, so much so that if you do not write an overly glorifying review of coconut oil something is wrong with you.  I'm not a believer in ONLY scientific studies and if that were the case I would not care for reviews by buyers from amazon.  And frankly I love you reviwers as you save me time and money.  However I do have a limit on what I hear from the internet.  And whenever there is the word "miracle" attached to something in the title I use a heavy amount of skepticism.  And MANY people believe coconut and coconut oil is a "miracle".<br /><br />Sorry folks it isn't.  I do realize all the benefits of coconut water by the way. Coconut water is extremely healthy and even used as in emergencies to substitute for human blood, but even so I would hesitate to call coconut water a "miracle" as drinking it alone is not a cure for aids, cancer, etc. as suggested by some. That, to me would constitute a true miracle. And if it were true, coconuts would have been discovered a long time ago as a cure for aids/cancer, etc.<br /><br />Coconut water is undoubtedly good FOR you and I love coconuts as a whole but do use some discretion when eating OIL.<br /><br />To me, if you're thin, eating fat is not so much an issue when the fat is healthier and you probably need some caloric substance. Extra virgin coconut oil, while still being researched, comes from a coconut and thusly is inherently healthy to some degree. However, if you're already overweight, then eating 3 tablespoons of oil, ANY oil, on TOP of what you eat amounts to 390+ calories extra which means you gain a pound in only 10 days.  It is VERY easy to overeat oil and that said I would really hesitate to overuse coconut oil or any oil without extensive studies.<br /><br />So those reading what I wrote, as of March 3rd, 2011 coconut oil is still being heavily studied.  Just google it if the following links do not show.<br />[...]If you're on the fence, don't consider it (or anything for that matter) a miracle until long term studies ARE done.  If it's oil, keep in mind moderation is always the key.  Don't buy the hype to eat 3 tablespoons a day if you're already overweight.

review/text: At this point I've ordered this coconut oil several time and I feel confident that Nutiva delivers a consistently excellent product. There is definitely some coconut taste due to the fact that it's a virgin product but that doesn't bother me at all. The taste and texture are alot more pleasant than other brands of coconut oil I have used in the past. I usually use it when making scrambled eggs or other assorted foods on the skillet. I can sometimes detect a little sweetness but I like it, especially with something salty. I have also used this oil to make chocolate truffles and baked goods and it has always come through like a champ. I highly recommend this as a great oil for any culinary purpose and I will definitely buy it again.

review/text: I don't know how I lived so long without this stuff. This brand is leaps and bounds superior to all the other coconut oils out there. It has comparatively little greasiness on the skin and absorbs quite fast. I use it as a moisturizer, shaving cream, makeup remover, hair conditioner, scar treatment, to relive itching on bug bites, lube (no latex condoms though please), foot treatment at night, massage oil, and I even use it on my pet hedgehog for his dry skin. It has  great texture and faint coconut smell that is pleasing and not overpowering. I don't regularly eat it or use it to cook with, but I have tasted it and it is nearly flavorless. I recommend this to nearly every person I talk to.

review/summary: Excellent coconut oil
review/text: I keep 1 in the bathroom, 1 in the kitchen. For folks with kinky hair this is a wonderful sealant to lock moisture into your hair. Think it's most useful if placed in hair AFTER a leave-in conditioner or other moisturizer. By itself, doesn't seem to moisturize - just sort of sits on the surface, looking greasy for a while. So after you've moisturized, rub a small amount of Nutiva between your hands and then lightly work it through your hair, with attention to your ends. Give it a few minutes to soak in to avoid the soul glo look: at first it will of course be shiny, but it soaks in very quickly and then your hair just looks lush and healthy (unless you get heavy handed with it - then it will stay looking greasy. Go light...you can always add a little more later). It's also a good sealant to use on your skin after putting on body moisturizer.<br /><br />Great in the kitchen too. Can use in pretty much anything, with excellent results. Recommend using this for anything you're going to heat, and saving the olive oil for cold dishes. There are a million other uses for coconut oil, so it's worth taking some time to look into. Cold pressed, virgin, organic coconut oil is what you want. Like with most oils, this one will change consistency depending on the temperature, but even when it solidifies, it will quickly liquify again if you rub it between your hands or heat it. Price of this product seems to vary, would take a quick look to find the most reasonable deal. The scent is earthy, nutty, and not too strong - not overwhelming like chemical coconut scents. Unless you have a sensitivity to/dislike of coconut, think you will like the scent.

review/summary: Great oil...especially for popcorn!
review/text: This coconut oil is the bomb-diggity! Seriously, it's really good stuff. I like the fact it's organic extra virgin--no extra stuff added. I use this oil about as much as I do olive oil. It has a nice flavor; it's not overwhelmingly coconutish. In fact, you can barely taste the coconut--it just adds a nice, mellow flavor to your food.<br /><br />My favorite thing to use it for is popcorn! I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper a few months ago, along with some Amish Country Popcorn, after a friend told me how great it was. YES! It makes the BEST popcorn (see my review for that for more details!) The oil melts nicely and quickly. It doesn't burn easily, so it's great for making foods that require high, fast heat.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!<br /><br />PS- The popcorn is Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country Gourmet Popping Corn.

When it turns to liquid , it feels like you have water in your mouth.There are so many benefits to using Coconut Oil and I just love the Nutiva brand.

After using it for cooking several times, I decided to try a tablespoon in a chocolate protein powder smoothy. With just the protein power, coconut oil, milk and ice and no other ingredients it ended up tasting like an Almond Joy / Mounds bar. Yummm.<br /><br />The size of the tub is perfect - very easy to scoop from. I like that it comes in a two-pack rather than one large container. When I start on the second jar, I will place another order. I never want to be without this brand of coconut oil!

review/summary: Best tasting coconut oil we've tried.
review/text: We have been using coconut oil instead of butter or margarine for a few years and have found this coconut oil from Nutiva to be the best flavor, and easiest spreading [when left at room temp.]. Some of the other brands tend to process the coconut flavor completely out, so tastes like you're eating lard. This has a mild, pleasant flavor we use for everything you would use butter for: toast, baked potatoes, corn on the cob is amazing! Thanks Nutiva!

review/text: I absolutely love this stuff and am always trying to find more uses for it! It has many health benefits and it smells and tastes heavenly. Some people may find the coconut aroma and flavor distasteful but not I!! I bought my first jar from a health food store, this is my second order and I hope it will arrive in tact as I see a few other reviewers have had troubles with shipping. I do already have experience with this oil though so I'm sure it will be a liquid when I receive and congeal as it is brought back to an air conditioned home's room temperature. That is normal for coconut oil.<br /><br />I am updating this review to say that it came in perfect condition! There were NO LEAKS, both containers were sealed tightly. No issues whatsoever. I just wish I had ordered the largest size since I love this product so much. I have been counting WW points and hit a plateau from using too few points. I began adding 1/2 T of this to my espresso in the AM with some Almond beverage and SF Hazelnut coffee syrup and started dropping the lbs. again! Don't know for sure this is what did it but I'm very happy to have that yummy creamy flavor and still be losing weight! Knowing also I'm adding good fat to my diet.<br /><br />5/9/2012<br />I'm ready to order again and researched the prices again also.  This size, although it gets used up fast, is the same price as the 2 - 54oz sizes and less than the 29oz size so I went with it again.

review/summary: How did I live without this?
review/text: I love Indian food and I love coconut so I thought I would try this. I read a bunch of reviews(on a different forum about the good effects of coconut oil):weight loss,:you can use it for a skin lotion and you will smell wonderful... etc. I decided to try it and it was so good you could eat it raw. It didn't absorb into meat but it did take longer to cook. Veggie "meats" it absorbed as quickly as other oils but I did lose 2 lbs the first 2 weeks I used it.

review/summary: Great tasting in oatmeal!
review/text: After reading good health reviews on this product I ordered some to use in cooking. I had my doubts because my husband never has liked coconut. I tried a Tbsp mixed in a sweet potato with some cinnamon and it was great but I just put cinnamon in my husband's sweet potato. After he saw how much I enjoyed my sweet potato with the yummy coconut oil, he said he might give it a try next time I used it. This morning I made oatmeal, adding a Tbsp of coconut oil. He loved it. He said, "This tastes so good, it must be bad for you." I can't wait to try it next time I cook chicken.

review/summary: Healthiest fat on the planet.
review/text: I love this product.  I originally used it because I learned that it was the healthiest fat for frying foods, even better than olive oil.  It can be used in place of any fat or oil need.  I use it, not only in cooking, but on my skin.  I use it on my face instead of face cream and my skin is soft and comfortable.  I also use it on the very dry skin on my feet.  I don't particularly like the taste of it, but I have friends who love it. If you like coconut, you will love this on salads etc.
