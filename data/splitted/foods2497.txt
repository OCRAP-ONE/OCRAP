review/summary: Best corn chowder ever!
review/text: I have used this mix for over a year and have probably made it at least a dozen times.  It's all-natural and very easy...just add your own potatoes, chicken broth, heavy cream, and chicken.  It tastes great, and I always get compliments on it and people asking for the recipe.  If you buy the 4-pack, you will use the 4-pack...it's that good.

review/summary: A Hit!
review/text: We had an Autumn soup party a couple of weeks ago, featuring 3 different soups and different artisan breads.  The overwhelmingly favorite soup was the Illinois Prairie Corn Chowder.  It couldn't have been easier to prepare, and I added absolutely nothing to it (except the fresh corn, as recommended on the package) and it tasted fantastic.  Everyone wanted my soup recipe and were surprised when I revealed that it was an easy to make packaged soup.<br /><br />The package makes a lot of soup, about 12 servings.  Since I had a large group, I made up two packages.  We were able to send extra servings home with our guests, and still had plenty left over for ourselves.<br /><br />I saw a review that suggested adding some cooked bacon to the soup.  I'm going to try that next time, even though the package mix requires no extra flavoring.  I just like the flavor of bacon.<br /><br />I'd recommend this soup to anyone who likes corn, chowder, and a rich tasty soup.

review/summary: Frontier Soups Hearty Meals Illinoise Prairie Corn Chowder
review/text: My family loves this soup.  It is so quick and easy to prepare.  It tastes like I cooked it all day, but of course I did not.  I just added a few ingredients listed on the package.  I even added a few more ingredients I thought might be good.  The first time I purchased it, I found it at a local craft show and wanted more so where did I look for it, on Amazon of course?  It is wonderful on a cold day with a special loaf of bread and salad.  I would recommend it to anyone that likes a hearty soup.  It arrived promptly and in great condition.  The price was good for the convenience and number of packages your receive.

review/summary: Stone soup
review/text: To make stone soup, one puts a stone in the pot and then a little onion and a left over carrot and whatever old stuff you have in the refrigertor and maybe a piece of chicken, and by golly, there is a pot of soup! To make this "creamy" corn chowder, you add a pint of heavy cream, and then 2-3 potatoes, and 2 quarts (1/2 gallon) chicken broth, and then "if available, 2-3 ears of corn." To be fair, the resultant soup tastes good, but, with these ingredients, it should; I just wish I had known what would be called for prior to spending any money. As an alternative, Amazon has a Turtle Island roasted corn chowder that is "just add water," and it is delicious. See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OREZAG">Turtle Island Southwestern Roasted Corn Chowder Mix, 5.5-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>.

review/summary: No Longer Effective In Asthma Relief ...
review/text: To protect consumers from what they deem dangerous chemicals, and sometimes in their control in banning and outlawing certain additives put into foodstuff, the FDA acts over-zealous and over-reaching.<br /><br />Several years ago teenagers in sports were especially using energy-enhancing supplements and drinks containing large amounts of "ephedra".  A significant number of these adolescents abusively overdosed on such supplements and drinks that caused many to become serious ill where some unfortunately died.  To counter this harmful trend, and instead of being selective in creating pragmatic regulations concerning quantity, the FDA altogether banned "ephedra" (aka: "endphdrine").<br /><br />For centuries, the herb "ephedra" traditionally was used in herbal teas and other health products to help ease and alleviate asthma attacks because of its unique and beneficial antispasmodic properties that facilitated in opening bronchial air passages.<br /><br />In the past, I regularly used Taditional Medicinals' "Breath Easy" herbal tea for years with great therapeutic success in controlling my asthma symptoms since it had a small amount of "ephedra" in it.  However, after trying this product's newly reformulation (re: removal of "ephedra") for four months, all I can say that for asthmatic relief, today's "Breath Easy" tea no longer effectively works for that purpose.

I almost panicked when Safeway quit carrying it, so went in search, finally finding it at online sites like Amazon and at a grocery in a neighboring town.  I have asked our local pharmacy to carry the product along with the Throat Ease (which also works great for sore throats) made by the same company.  This stuff works!

review/text: I love this tea. I have to say that this is the best natural product I've ever had that did what it described on the box.<br /><br />I'm in Colorado (originally from Texas) and had mad allergies. My lover gave me a cup of the tea and it tasted fantastic.<br /><br />Halfway through the tea, I was already blowing everything out of my nose and was already expectorating. I felt great after, and I could finally sleep peacefully, since the allergy medicine didn't work for me after a short period of time.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for people with allergies, chest colds, head colds, common colds, and mild sinus infections.

review/summary: I Like This Way More Than I Should
review/text: I'm a perpetual dieter and I don't really have a huge sweet tooth so I'm kind of shocked at how much I like this product. It's way better than any other store bought frosting/glaze I've ever had. Where I live, one of the grocery stores makes chocolate cake donuts and this glaze and those donuts are to DIE for!<br /><br />You might be kind of surprised at the size of the bottle but not to worry, there's enough in there to more than cover a 9x13 inch cake.<br /><br />I don't use this to "frost" an entire cake. We like to take donuts or a piece of cake, microwave it until it's warm and then heat the glaze in the microwave for about 10 seconds and drizzle it onto the individual serving of cake. This is great for us because my husband and I are about as different as two people can get and he likes sweet stuff much more than I do so I can have less on my cake than he puts on his so we are both happy.<br /><br />This is good on chocolate muffins too and maybe the best thing about it is rather than having a large cake sitting around where I and my hubs are constantly tempted, we can just do one serving at a time.<br /><br />I've bought this several times now and will no doubt buy it again.

review/text: V8 vegetable juice has been a staple in our kitchen for decades.  The spicy hot variety adds a little zing without overdoing it.  It is great cold but it is also a really tasty hot drink when microwaved and a little parmesan or blue cheese is added on top.  With crackers and some fruit or veggies it makes a great light lunch or quick snack.  It is also one of the items in my kitchen cabinet that I grab when making soup as it enriches the flavor nicely.  The best thing is to know that I am enjoying something that both tastes good and is for for me.  And subscribe and save makes it a good deal price wise.

review/text: This juice is phenomenal--it's not the product I have a problem with, but the price I just paid ($35.76 for a case of 24).  Spicy V8 is all I ever buy, but is extremely difficult to find in the 11.5 oz cans.  I ordered this online thinking it would probably cost a little more, but imagine my surprise and chagrin when I found a case of 24 regular V8, 11.5 oz cans, at Costco yesterday (1-12-11)for $12.59. Just how much could spicing up the V8 cost the manufacturer?  My stupidity (I rate myself a "minus one star" for consumerism), but paying TRIPLE the price is a bit much.  I'm keeping the order, of course, because it was my mistake totally, but you can bet this won't happen again.

review/summary: Not Tagliatelle!
review/text: While this is a wonderful tasting pasta the order I recieved contained clearly labeled Linguine, definitely NOT Tagliatelle. We will use up this pasta as the taste is nice but I am back on the hunt for genuine Tagliatelle. I guess I need to cancel the Subscribe and Save order for this pasta.

review/summary: Really nice tasting pasta in a hard to find shape
review/text: Love tagliatelle which is not easy to find.  This pasta has a great flavor - slightly nutty when cooked al dente and lots of body/integrity - really stands up to heavy red sauce.  A more than decent value.  According to the package, they have been at it since the 1300s so I figure they are close to perfecting the recipe.  Again, a really good value that I will purchase again.

review/summary: Blue longevity kitten food
review/text: Having adopted a kitten from the Humane Society, full of parasites and<br />bacteria from other cats, she was already traumatized from a previously<br />rejected adopter, and we were lucky to find her.<br />A Siamese Tabby point and into everything, her energy was soon made<br />apparent when we found the Blue Longevity.. Having had miserable bouts<br />of diarrhea for several months, she regained her strength after a long drug<br />treatment and we saw her charisma come right out after a frustrating<br />battle to gain weight and just feel better, which she really did. Trying other<br />vet recommended foods was no good. Boiled chicken and rice was becoming<br />tedious for us all, and Blue really came in and won the day. So I heartily<br />recommend this kitten food for those little souls who need a lift and<br />a stable stomach-friendly diet. Bravo Blue Buffalo. 10/10. Our little girl Cleo went<br />from 2lbs at 4 months old to almost 8lbs at 7 months. Skin and coat immaculate,<br />full of life, bright and alert. We have to import Blue as we live in the Caribbean,<br />but it's most certainly worth the crazy methods we use to get it here!

review/summary: Love this brand!
review/text: When we first got out kitten we were feeding her Iams, Purina... one of those big name cat food brands. However, we moved to a new location and we came across this brand and I instantly fell in love. All you really need to do it read the ingredients in the back. Practically, everything that you would see a cat eat in the wild is in the food. There is real meat and fish in there, blueberries, cranberries and vegetables as well. I can't really say that I noticed a huge change in my kitten since she was always a terror before the switch but I did notice that her coat looked shinier. Yes, it's extra money but it is well worth forking over the money for when you look at it in the long run.

review/summary: My Kittens Will Not Eat This High Quality Food
review/text: I have purchased alot of the Blue Buffalo canned food for my kittens, so I thought I'd try the Dry food.  Unfortunately, they don't like it.  My rating is only based on my kittens not liking this food.  Your cats may love it!  I think the quality of the product is superb, with the first ingredient listed as deboned white fish, followed by salmon meal.  There's also vegetables listed: carrots, spinach, broccoli, tomatoes.  The crude protein % is listed at 35%!  I do think this product is high quality, and the price does reflect that.  I'm a firm believer in "you get what you pay for" -<br /><br />Some of us don't like caviar.<br /><br />I really wish my kittens liked this food.  The size of the food pieces are tiny for little kittys mouths.  This item uses REAL FISH and my cats will not eat it.  I'm bothered by that.  They like the Hill's Science Diet for kittens.<br /><br />I rated it 3 stars because I think it's a high quality pet food with excellent ingredients even if my kittens don't like it.  I would have rated it 5, if they did like it.  I think it's a great product and priced fairly.  I don't expect to pay pennies for quality, and this is a premium food for kittens.

review/summary: the best ever
review/text: Even on a modified gluten-free diet these are permitted for me.  They have a slight buttery taste which makes them appealiing for all types of appetizers or snacks; they are especially good with a spread, like Nutella.  They always arrive unbroken because they are so well packed and they are consistently fresh. There are a variety of uses for these, from snacks to saads to main dishes--they are kid friendly also because of the great taste.  Pricing is better than through grocery store.

review/summary: Poor quality ? past shelf life?
review/text: I loved this product as a teenager and hadn't seen it for years until it showed up on the shelf at my local grocery. The quality of the product I bought at the store was great and I love this product not only for taste and versatility but it is low cal. However, I was disappointed in the product I received via Amazon. It seemed that the toast was very brittle and if I had to guess I bet it was because maybe it was past its prime shelf life. I will still continue to order groceries from Amazon because for the most part I have been satisfied.

review/summary: Fabulous!
review/text: These are great - they work well with peanut butter or flavored cream cheese for a sweet treat or with tuna or egg salad as well.  I have them in place of toast since I am on low carbs and they are great with eggs in the morning.  Serving size is two but I usually only need one so the carb count is only 5.5 that way. (11 for 2 pieces)  They are a little dry to eat plain but I have buttered them and eaten them plain as well and that works too.  I haven't tried it yet but I think they would work broken into a salad as croutons too.<br /><br />The only downfall I found is the packaging.  Once opened you can't close it so I slide the opened package into a ziplock bag (gallon size) and they stay perfectly fresh.

review/text: These Rusks are delicious.  They are not very nutricious, but they are a low caloried alternative to crackers and breads.  I spread them with peanut butter or jelly.  Or I spread low fat cream cheese and top with a slice of turkey.  You can crumble them up in salads as "croutons".  They come tightly packed in a nice box so 90-95% of them aren't broken.  They have a fairly long shelf life so they won't go stale if you keep them tightly sealed in a plastic bag or container after opening a package.

I recall we spread them with tuna salad, a slice of tomato, topped with a slice of American cheese, then placed them in the oven.<br /><br />My purchase arrived fresh, crisp, and very enjoyable.  I was concerned about freshness, but I need not have worried.  They were well packed and, so far, no broken pieces.  I've enjoyed sharing them with family and friends.

review/text: I purchased the Old World collection directly from the Spice Lab as a Father's Day gift for my husband.  The item was extremely well packed and arrived ahead of schedule. A small wooden salt spoon, sample packets of gourmet salts and a reference/index card with information about each of the 11 salts were included. Brett was responsive and helpful. This is a great company with an interesting variety of salts and spices. I will definitely make a future purchase and refer the Spice Lab to others.<br /><br />UPDATE: I'm disappointed that my email reguarding a broken test tube and cork has gone unanswered.  The first time I used one of the salts, I was extrememly gentle but a large piece broke off as well as some of the cork top. The tubes should not be so fragile so I sent an email to that affect to Brett, the owner. Despite answering my initial email about how much I loved the gift and where could I post a positive comment, he has not responded with regards to the breakage. Good customer service would be to follow up.....

review/text: On Sept.12 I posted the following seller review:<br />  3/5 stars:<br />  "I'm sorry to say that this item arrived with some slight cosmetic damage. On the top front edge of the rack there is what I would call a dent, but it's also rough. From the way it was packaged I would have to say that it was that way when it was put into the box. I intended this as a gift, and I don't have time to return it, so I'll just try to sand it down so it's at least smooth."<br />  Jammies, September 12, 2012<br />Later Amazon added:<br />  Message from Amazon: "This item was fulfilled by Amazon, and we take responsibility for this fulfillment experience."<br /><br />Shortly after I posted it, I received an email from The Spice Lab Inc. offering to send a new block. I sent them a couple of pictures of the damaged area. They sent me a new block and two little spoons to replace the one that was missing from my original order. The replacement block arrived yesterday in plenty of time for my trip to visit my son and daughter-in-law.<br /><br />In hindsight, I should have contacted The Spice Lab before I posted the review, so they could have had time to resolve the problem. I had jumped to the conclusion that I'd need to return the item in order to get a replacement, which wasn't the case.<br /><br />Since it's a gift, I can't speak to the quality of the salt, but I can say that the block is very sturdy and attractive, and the little spoon is a charming addition.<br /><br />I greatly appreciate the efforts of Brett at The Spice Lab, and I would happily buy from them again.

review/summary: Pricey but nice selection of salts
review/text: I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes exotic salts, and it was a hit with him. It was well packaged with no breakage. (Some of the reviews have mentioned that they received broken containers.) The wooden holder is nice but not all that permanent. I would recommend this for someone who'd like to sample various kinds of salt and doesn't mind paying a high price. The reason I gave it four and not five stars was the price.

review/summary: Tasty Coffee
review/text: I ordered this brand on a whim, I knew I wanted a Kona blend of some sort.  This turned out to be a great choice.  The choclate taste is present, but not overwhelming and the coffee taste is clearly present.  I would classify it as a medium/dark roast and seems to have a slightly higher than average caffeine content, which is fine with me.  I find myself using very little sugar and no creamer, though I usually put creamer in my coffee.<br /><br />Great taste and great value as well.  I will likely buy this coffee again.

review/summary: Sea Salted Caramels
review/text: Solay Gourmet Himalayan Sea Salt and Celtic Salt Soft Vanilla Caramels are without a doubt the most incredible, creamy caramel I have ever eaten.  I love the added crunch of the sea salt and have tried numerous brands, all ranging from pricey to more pricier.  These are worth every cent and are the best I have had.  This will be the second time I have ordered the caramels and will continue to do so.  I limit myself to one or two a day which is really hard to do, but with the cost I want them to last a little while before having to order again.  Try them, I assure you, you will not be disappointed.

Now that Eden has teamed up with Lundberg as a source<br />for their rice, the cereal tastes very good. Prior to this, the cereal did have a rancid flavor, as another reviewer may have mentioned. At times, when I eat it alone, I add various nuts, seeds and dried fruits. I liked it so much, I am get it through the subscribe and save program.

Further, you can determine the consistency, whether you want to make it thick or thin. It's delicious, healthy, has an excellent shelf life, I eat it every day, as I said, couldn't live without it.

review/summary: Favorite thing about Brazil
review/text: I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture. This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they aren't! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold.<br /><br />Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish. They never turn out wrong.

review/summary: Thai Instant Coffee
review/text: I purchased this product in the hope of being able to make Thai Iced Coffee at home without the need of going to a Thai restaurant to purchase it.  It didn't taste anything like restaurant Thai Iced Coffee.  The absence of cardamon, a key ingredient in Thai Iced Coffee, was evident.  It tastes more like a poor-quality mocha latte.  The only positive thing I can say is that it wasn't as sweet as restaurant Thai Iced Coffee, which I always dilute with milk.  Anyway, I didn't like it; but it was worth the try.
