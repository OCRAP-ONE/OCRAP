review/summary: Our very picky eater likes it.
review/text: We have a dog who doesn't like to eat. He is 6 1/2 years old and is terribly skinny. We have bought dozens of different kinds of food to tempt him to eat. This is the only one we have found that he will actually eat day after day. It is moist and our dog seems to think it is delicious.

review/text: When i initially purchased this item for my dog, i was a bit nervous. I had given her the food (and had slightly heated it up) and she smelled it and walked away.  Now, however i do not heat it...and she eats it.  The reason i heated it was because she had preferred it with past wet food, but obviously this was better at room temperature.

review/summary: Tempted my 14 year 8 mo old dog to eat!
review/text: I tried some of this on my old guy, an American Staffordshire Terrier that is 14 years, 8 months old. He had just gone through a phase of refusing to eat his normal food, which is good stuff, but is a dry kibble mini disc type ( Bench & Field Holistic - Very good food! )<br />So I got some canned foods to try on him.  Got the Newman's, and 2 other organic kinds.  Buster just loves the canned foods, but the consistency of some of the others is sloppier and harder for him to eat, as they just seem to mash into the bowl, and he has to lick them instead of being able to eat them in soft chunks.  This food smells almost good enough to make me hungry...... and is easy to spoon into his dish, where it takes him less than a nano-second to select a nice chunk and eat it.  I just stand there, and spoon a few chunks at a time into his bowl and he looks for more.<br />So I am really happy with this food and even if he DOES get spoiled on it, he's so worth spoiling at his advanced age that I don't consider it a problem!<br />Before this, I was cooking human food to tempt him just to eat, so this is better balanced and seems to give him more energy.<br />( Before this, he was feed on free schedule, with a bowl of dry food out at all times, and he would eat every 3 days when he felt like it. That worked very well for 14 plus years!  I did the same with my first AmStaff, and he made it to 15. ) Also, Buster has NEVER had to make a vet visit for illness or medical problem his entire life until 2 weeks ago, so that eating arrangement obviously worked great for a very long time!  ; )

review/summary: HONEST REVIEW!
review/text: I live in Manhattan and i have a beagle (5yr old) n i ordered this food because the economy is bad and i need cheap afforable dog food. People talk about this food as if its garbage so i did my research by a co worker who used to work for pedigree and online. The food is proccess is nasty! but if has all the vitamins and protien needed for all dogs. I checked cans at a pet store and pediagree had more vitamins and more crude protien then science diet n others. I know the food is made bad but it isnt effecting your dog. I recieved the cans unharmed just 1 was a lil bent but it wasnt a biggy n i recieved it fairly quick and my dog loves the food. I recommend this food for low income pet owners.  N pedigree may be bad but feeding your dog people food is even worse. Think about that!. Also Pedigree was the #1 dog food back in the 80S n 90s but since all these new dog food came out and research was done on the food was declared garbage. It still used in shelters.

review/summary: Delicious Meaty Dog Food
review/text: Pedigree  smells delicious.  It is an enticing smell, good enough to make humans turn their noses toward it.  A black lab and a standard poodle in our family agree that it tastes delicious.  The meaty chunks of real beef  in a doggy-tasty gravy pleases the most finicky canines. None of the humans in the family have tried it though.<br /><br />It has all the meat in it that a dog needs for maintenance, and it can be mixed with dry food for extra crunch.  There is the right balance of calcium and phosphorus for strong teeth and bones, according to the Pedigree people.  It also has omega fatty acids and the essential nutrient for healthy skin and a shiny coat.  The dogs find it highly digestible so that the nutrients are easily absorbed.  (All these features are listed on the Pedigree web page.)<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Beans but no seasoning
review/text: That's basically it. If you offer a Cholent kit, you could at least send along a spice packet, without which this is just, well, beans. For all that trouble, I can buy beans much closer to home from Hispanic and Texas sources.<br /><br />Real cholent tastes like Texas-style refried beans. It's not a coincidence. Those beans represent an ancient branch of Judaism that came to the New World with the Spaniards and taught the locals how to make all kinds of cholent versions, including Cuban black-bean soup. Unfortunately, that version of cholent that still survives doesn't pass muster for kosher nowadays. And, Gefen isn't helping matters.<br /><br />Oh yes. Cook at least 24 hours in a crock pot, adding water periodically, because it tends to boil down. Oh yes, something like 5/6 cup of dry beans will feed at least 3 people, but add carrots and onions.

review/summary: Not the same stuff sold in the US
review/text: This is the oatmeal my father's family regularly sent us from Puerto Rico when I was a child, and boy am I happy to have found a way to buy it myself all these years later. Even if you haven't taken any Spanish language classes you can probably pick out that "avena instantanea" is, in fact, "instant oatmeal," and Quaker is, of course, Quaker. The same brand you see every time you walk down the cereal aisle in your grocery store. Yet this oatmeal is substantively different from the oatmeal you can buy in Illinois. It's smoother somehow, creamier. I've purchased many varieties of American Quaker oatmeal and cooked it in the method that I learned as a girl, but it is not the same. It does not make a bowl of "Puerto Rican oatmeal," as my sister and I came to call it. This, however, does.<br /><br />If you grew up in the Caribbean and have tried to reproduce the oatmeal of your youth, here it is. If you have no idea what I'm talking about but you like oatmeal, give it a shot. I like to cook it with skim milk (and a splash of half and half, as the milk fat makes it creamier), then dump cinnamon and blueberries into it so I can feel all smug about my healthful breakfast. Delicious!

review/summary: Something Changed, And In A Bad Way
review/text: I've been enjoying this product for years.  It was by far my favorite bourbon, and I didn't mind spending $40 on such a small bottle as it was so amazingly good.  However, they've recently changed something about the way that they make it, and the quality has gone WAY down.  I've tried three different bottles recently, all from different batches, and they were all extremely lackluster.  The great taste is gone, and has been replaced with a rather unpleasant harshness.  I can only hope this change wasn't intentional and things will eventually go back to normal, but for now, I'm disappointed to say that I strongly recommend staying away from this bourbon.  It's simply not worth the price.

review/text: I'm not the world's greatest at describing coffee, but I do know what I like. I tend to prefer dark roasts, and I don't like anything acidic or too bitter. This Tchibo Gold is an excellent choice in a moderately priced ground German-roast coffee. It seems to be a darker roast, and the flavor is bold with a hint of a smoky note. Amazon supplied fresh coffee, and as expected the service was excellent.

review/text: I agree with all the reviewers who found this coffee smoother and less acidic than domestic U.S. brands. It is good coffee, but it is not exceptional coffee. While I consider Tchibo Gold of better quality, I found the flavor similar to regular Folgers coffee. If you think U.S coffee brands generally taste fine and you'd like something similar that is easier on the palate and the stomach, Tchibo is probably a good choice. For a flavor that is different and very outstanding, I'd recommend trying Dallmayr (also available on Amazon).

review/text: I have two little power chewers (under 20 pounds each) who can tear through a regular rawhide roll in a couple of hours. After three days they each could only manage to eat about one fourth of a roll. These rolls are gigantic compared to the regular 10" rolls I have been giving them. I had to cut them in half to make them easier for my dogs to handle. Usually, my dogs strip off large pieces of a rawhide roll but they couldn't do that with these rolls, the hide is too thick (it ranges from about 1/8" to 1/4" thick). Four of these rolls lasted for about a month with two small dogs chewing on them for about two hours every day.

review/text: These rawhides are great!<br /><br />It is really hard to find rawhides that are made in America using American cows. It really does matter where they are made because the US has laws against using formaldehyde and other deadly preservatives in products meant for pet consumption.<br /><br />If your pet is a heavy chewer and goes through rawhides like candy, then they could be consuming harmful amounts of poisonous stuff.<br /><br />This article does a great job discussing the topic:<br />[...]<br /><br />These Rawhides are made by Pet Factory in Illinois. They are talked about in the article as being great quality rawhides but they go on to say that the company does not sell directly to the public so they are really hard to find.<br /><br />But here they are!!<br /><br />They are really thick and last a very long time. They are a great value too. Petco makes a "Retriever Roll" for $5 each that are of lesser quality than these Pet Factory ones.<br /><br />I order 10 at a time though and when I first open that box, the smell is pretty gnarly; which is exactly how natural rawhide is supposed to be. Just open the box outside and let them air out a bit before bringing them inside and everything is fine.

It's also the least expensive price I found for Pitta.  The three cans have a lot of tea in them.  I thought 2 oz wouldn't be much, but it's a lot of tea.  Well worth the price.

review/summary: Great flavor!
review/text: I purchased this product because I make a lot of pizzas and the reviewers rave about this sauce. I waffled a bit before I purchased it because 12 cans is a lot to use up if you don't like it. Well, I took the plunge figuring I could hide it in meatloaf or spaghetti sauce if I didn't absolutely love it but I have to admit, I'm impressed. This sauce has deep, rich tomato flavor with not a hint of anything artificial. It's a keeper. I gave it four stars for two reasons. I feel that it's just slightly heavy on the spices and also, it's too thick--concentrated almost like a tomato paste. I add a full can of slightly drained, chopped tomatoes to a half can of the muir glen and pulse them together 12 times in my food processor. The resulting taste and texture is reminds me of good pizzeria pizza sauce and surpasses anything I was making from scratch.  Ican also see using this sauce in my spaghetti sauce and meatloaf with great results.  Highly recommended (Get on autoship to save more money).

review/text: This pizza sauce is fantastic.  It is the tastiest canned pizza sauce I have ever used, and I have tried many different brands. In my opinion, this is the difference between good and great homemade pizza. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Perfect Pizza Sauce
review/text: Not too sweet, not too spicy and just the right consistency for pizza. I highly recommend this sauce.<br /><br />How much pizza can you make with one can?<br /><br />If you are making one 16" round pizza you will likely have extra sauce unless you lay it on extra thick. On an 18" round pizza the sauce still covers nicely but you might not have any left over for dipping.<br /><br />I typically make a single 12" diameter pizza and I like to lay the sauce on thick. One can is more than enough for two of these pizzas, which causes a left-over problem. Another reviewer suggests freezing the extra but that requires advanced planning to account for thaw time and I'm a guy so I never plan that far ahead.<br /><br />Some calculations:<br /><br />I figure one ounce of sauce can thickly cover about 15 sq inches of pizza. This is based on my experience with 12" diameter pizzas:<br /><br />... 12" diameter = 113 sq in<br />... 2 pizzas @ 113 sq in each = ~15 sq in per ounce<br /><br />15 ounces @ 15 sq in per ounce means one can is enough sauce for 225 sq in of coverage, or about one 17" diameter round pizza. But who makes 17" round pizzas?<br /><br />If each ounce covers 15 sq in of pizza, one 15oz can will cover ...<br /><br />* one 18" dia round pizza (255 sq in) @ 0.059 ounce / sq in, nicely covered<br />* one 16" dia round pizza (201 sq in) @ 0.075 ounce / sq in, extra thickly covered<br />* two 12" dia round pizzas (226 sq in) @ 0.066 ounce / sq in, thickly covered<br />* one 15"x15" square pizza (225 sq in) @ 0.066 ounce / sq in, thickly covered<br />* one 13"x18" baker's half sheet (234 sq in) @ 0.064 ounce / sq in, thickly covered<br />* two 9"x13" quarter sheet pans (234 sq in) @ 0.064 ounce / sq in, thickly covered<br /><br />By "thickly covered" I mean the sauce oozes when you take a bite. If you like to spread the sauce thinly you will have extra for dipping. Bonus!<br /><br />For my twelve inch pizza-making purposes a 7 or 8oz can would be ideal but I'm not going to stop buying the 15 ounce cans. I'll just have to eat more pizza.<br /><br />By the way, if you like pepperoni, I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JW96I">Bridgford Pepperoni, Old World, 16-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 3)</a>. Good stuff.

review/text: I am a really picky pizza maker.  Since I found the perfect recipe for the crust, I have been testing various toppings.  Since I make almost everything from scratch, I used to make pizza sauce from scratch as well, but that got to be really time consuming.  So, if I'm in a rush, I use this canned sauce because is the best I have found.  It's terrific as a base for marguerita pizza.

review/text: After trying a few different brands of organic, healthy pizza sauce, this one has easily hands down become my favorite.  Not only is it great as a pizza sauce, but I also use it as a pasta sauce for spaghetti and chicken parmesan.  I do not care for spicy anything, and I do not find it too spicy at all.  If you make homemade pizza or eat pasta, I'd encourage you to give this sauce a try.  Not only is it delicious, it is also healthy.

review/text: I used to make my own pizza sauce before I discovered Muir Glen.  This sauce is rich and thick.  It also has a familiar, traditional pizza flavor that my two young boys approve of!  The best part is that it doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup like many other brands do.  If you make a lot of pizza, the case price is a good buy.

review/text: Wow. This can of Pizza sauce is seriously the best sauce our family has ever had! We purchased a pack of 12 and gave out many cans to our friends to try and they were totally impressed also. Not over seasoned and tastes of really ripe tomatoes. Super red color, all natural, organic and totally simple. We love simple food that tastes like it is supposed to. This product tastes like the most lovely tomatoes picked fresh from the garden and freshly pureed but still has texture. Love it! Your homemade pizza will be perfect with this sauce and you won't get any pesticides that create cancer in your pizza to boot! How can you knock that?

Made with all organic ingredients, you can eat it without fear of eating anything harmful -- because it's full of safe, organic, ingredients!<br /><br />Use it as a pizza sauce.  Use it as a spaghetti sauce, or wherever tomato sauce or a similar ingredient is called for.  You can even melt cheese, then pour it IN the sauce, mix the two together, and add to a calzone / pirogie crust!  The extra spices make this pizza sauce taste different from regular tomato sauce or tomato paste; they are just the RIGHT spices to make anything you add this sauce to, taste like pizza!<br /><br />At 40 calories per serving, and 7 servings per can, each can contains 240 calories.<br />This makes it a very tasty, quite low-calorie snack, all by itself!<br /><br />If you like pizza, you will like this pizza sauce!

review/text: Love the flavor of this pizza sauce, and the price (especially for organic products) and also the convenience of ordering from amazon. For each of those points, it gets a star.<br /><br />The one thing I can't stand about it, though, is the dehydrated "onion" - it's SO tough and dried, I really can't chew it up that well. At least, it takes longer to chew than anything else so I'm occasionally left with what seems like a little bit of plastic to spit out - it's really quite disgusting. I don't think I'll be purchasing any of this pizza sauce ... probably will try to run the remaining cans of sauce through a sieve or something before using.

review/summary: Delicious, delicate and subtle chocolate
review/text: I hadn't tried Numi teas prior to this, but I will definitely be purchasing this particular tea in the future.<br /><br />I'm a bit of a tea junkie, and use a dedicated Zarafina tea brewer (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HJNJNO">Zarafina Tea Maker Suite with Ceramic Tea Pots, Cups, and Serving Tray</a>) for making both loose-leaf and bagged teas, as I find I get a more consistent cup of tea this way - this may or may not be the issue some of the other reviewers were running into with their cups.<br /><br />I've found this tea to be a very pleasant surprise.  I don't typically like "flavored" teas, such as blueberry or strawberry, but this tea caught me off guard.  After pouring the tea, I noticed a very pleasant chocolate scent coming from the cup.  While most flavored teas have a stronger odor and weak taste, the chocolate and vanilla taste in this tea is definitely pronounced without being overbearing or cloying, and really didn't need sweetening.  If you do decide to sweeten it, I would recommend something simple, such as raw sugar or a half packet of Splenda.  Anything more aggressive would probably ruin the taste of this tea; definitely don't use a creamer.<br /><br />The chocolate and vanilla flavor is pretty complex, especially for a bagged tea.  I found it a very pleasant change from my standard English breakfast and white teas.  It's a black tea, but not as aggressive as most black teas are.  My wife is a die-hard coffee drinker, but even she got hooked on this one, and it's become a habit to have a cup of this after dinner.<br /><br />It *would* be nice to have a loose-leaf variety of this tea for the tea elitists like myself, but it's not a dealbreaker for me.  I'm a big fan of this one, and it has me considering other bagged teas for the future.

review/summary: My favorite tea in the whole world. Period.
review/text: Now, I don't presume to say that this is a tea for everyone. I don't quite get it, but obviously, considering the reviews, many people don't like it at all. (I gave t-bags to 2 co-workers, after raving about how wonderful this is, and their lack of comment 6 weeks later tells me that they didn't like it, either.) It's up to you whether you want to risk disliking it, or missing out on something truly amazing. (Rule of thumb: If you like pu-erh, you might as well try it; if not, this might not be your best introduction to it.)<br /><br />When I'm having a horrible day, when things have turned sour and the world seems to be against me, this is my cup of comfort, my security blanket. It soothes me, calms me with its sheer deliciousness. (Give a child a big bar of chocolate, and he'll stop sulking in no time. That's my equivalent.)<br /><br />Now, this tea is amazing, but far from perfect. I wish there were twice as much tea in each bag, for starters; this is a bit weak, and I use big mugs. I wish there was more pu-erh than condiments (chocolate nibs, orange pieces) per bag. I wish that it was good for multiple re-steepings, as most pu-erhs are. A few more t-bags per box would be very nice too, or a lower price tag.<br /><br />In fact, these shortcomings annoy me a bit, and I've been looking for other chocolate teas (pu-erh and non-pu-erh) to substitute it. So far they've all failed. It is next to impossible to find *good* chocolate tea; most are terrible. See: I hate rooibos, so that plus chocolate equals "eeew". I like black tea, but haven't found a good combination yet. Green tea and chocolate sounds gross; I haven't tried it yet. Same for white and oolong. I've only found another brand of chocolate pu-erh (Mighty Leaf) but the flavor wasn't there.<br /><br />But I found a way to make this perfect: I cut a bag open and mix it with regular pu-erh; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5L0I">Rishi Tea Organic Pu-erh Tuo Cha Loose Tea, 5-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a> or a Camel's Breath tuo cha work beautifully. This way I can steep it 3-4 times, and I get the yummy flavor in a much stronger version. Heavenly!!!

review/text: Every bag of this tea I've tried so far has been very different from  the other bags. Sort of a Tea roulette. Several cups have been quite weak, even in a six ounce cup, no matter how long I brewed it. One cup was strong but bitter, another had a huge amount of cocoa powder sediment. I tried double bagging one cup which made a strong, bitter cup that tasted more like stale coffee than like either tea or chocolate and one cup was actually pretty good. Only one cup had any discernible spice flavor.  The cocoa seems to be rather poor quality too. On the other hand one of my daughters' just loves it.

review/text: A very tasteful tea with just the perfect hint of chocolate.  Good for the sunday afternoon when you need a warm refresher.  I'm more of a dark tea drinker, earl grey is probably my favorite flavor and english breakfast at a close second.  This tea for me is definitely a situational tea.  The hint of chocolate goes perfect with a small serving of ice cream or a nice spring afternoon at the porch.  It isn't the best tea for early mornings, nor is it something you drink at the end of the night.  I would recommend this tea along with your vanilla ice cream as they just seem to compliment each other.  The tea is bold though and of good quality and the flavor is not bitter at all.

review/text: I won't call myself a tea expert.  Organic green tea is pretty much all I drink.  I'm known as the "tea expert" in my social circle because I know of the existence of white tea (although I haven't tried it yet).  Onen day, I was in a Natural Foods store, and the attractive package and appealing description of this Numi tea caught my eye.  Since I was on vacation, I splurged and bought the box.  Tried it as soon as I got home.<br /><br />And I've never looked back.  I admit, the first cup wasn't eye-popping.  It had a pleasant taste, but I decided it wasn't worth the $10 I had to spend on the single box (Amazon sure has a nice deal going on).  Except, the next day, I found myself looking forward to having another cup.  It WAS good - such a unique, warm taste.  Over the next few days, I discovered that - in my opinion - it tastes best after brewing for 5+ minutes in WARM water, not boiling.  I just let the faucet run on hot, and fill up the cup with it.  That's probably not the "right" way to brew tea, but<br /><br />I've since had a steady supply of this tea - it's just delicious.  Highly recommended!

review/text: Unsweetened, this has a nice mellow, black tea flavor, with a hint of cocoa, orange and spice.  Sweetened with sugar, the flavors intesify somewhat, but when I added a splash of soy milk, it completely dominated the flavor and the subtleness of the cocoa and orange was lost.  Perhaps cow's milk would be better if you prefer milk with your tea.<br /><br />For anyone on a gluten-free diet like myself, Numi's website states that all their teas are gluten free, with no chance of cross contamination.<br /><br />I think I'll go have another cup.

review/summary: Another wonderful Numi Tea
review/text: I've been looking forward to yet another good Numi tea flavor. This is a blend of chocolate with vanilla flavors.  I personally drink the Dry Desert Lime and the Jasmine.  I am the only person in my family who likes the Dry Desert Lime though.  One time was enough for everyone else.  So a more user friendly flavor, like this one, is much appreciated.<br /><br />As far as the chocolate flavor, no one is going to say, "Oh, chocolate," when they taste it.  It is a lot subtler than that.  The same is true of the vanilla.  These are undertones to the full bodied tea taste instead.<br /><br />It tastes great, either hot or cold.  I even drink it at room temperature.<br /><br />I've tried it out on my mother-in-law.  She generally does NOT like the Numi teas, finding them too weird.  However, this is the first Numi tea I've tried on her where she drank the whole thing and said she liked it.<br /><br />There is another great painting on the box as the female half owner of Numi uses the teas to paint. Her paintings are reproduced on the boxes which is a very nice touch.

review/summary: Pleasant, but you only get one cup of tea per bag
review/text: Chocolate Puerh is a good cup of tea.  It is certainly different, with the chocolate in it, but not what I would characterize as a truly excellent tea. Since good-quality puerh black tea has a rich complexity of earthly flavors, it makes me wonder why Numi decided to dress it up with chocolate and spices.  I discovered puerh tea at a wonderful tea shop in Xi'an, China, and this just is not the same thing...maybe I was just expecting something different.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. I wouldn't call this a sit-and-savor-it kind of tea, but it's pleasant.  It reminds me of a mild chai tea.<br />2. It doesn't seem to get bitter as it cools down.<br />3. It's organic, and comes from sustainably harvested wild tea trees.<br />4.  The chocolate and spices are nicely balanced, and there is no need to add milk or sugar.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The directions don't state the yield of the tea bag, or even how much water to use.<br />2. The directions state to pour boiling water over the tea bag.  I was taught that water for good quality tea should be very hot, but not boiling.  So why are they telling me to put boiling water on it?<br />3. The directions also do not say anything about re-steeping.  I found that the teabag only was useful for one 8 oz. cup of tea, which I steeped for four minutes (directions say to steep it from 3 - 5 minutes).  I tried re-steeping it, and the resulting brew was very bland.<br />4.  Top quality puerh tea generally is more robust than this tea.  At one cup per bag, it seems a bit pricey for what you get.<br /><br />Overall conclusions:  It's very pleasant, but not earth-shaking.

review/summary: Great Balance of Chocolate Flavor
review/text: I'm usually a strictly black tea drinker - I don't need anything too fancy in the morning. After trying Numi's Chocolate Puerh, it's going to be hard to go back to basics. It has a great chocolate flavor which blends perfectly with the flavor of the tea. It is rich, but not overpowering - drinks great with or without milk. Great way to start the morning, or equally good as a nightcap before bed. Definitely worth trying.

This tea feels a bit richer than average tea, but I wouldn't say it tastes very chocolatey. The over-riding flavor is black tea. Adding a splash of milk and a bit of honey enhances the subtle hint of chocolate.

review/summary: Kind of watery tasting....
review/text: This tea is really different. I taste chocolate if I think about it, don't notice the orange, cinnamon or vanilla at all and find the nutmeg to be the strongest flavor. Take the word "strongest" with a grain of salt....I found this tea to be very watery with little body. Perhaps I added too much water - I used about 8 ounces. I even just left the bag in the mug, hoping that if it steeped longer the flavors would intensify. No luck. Even my favorite tea, Stash White Christmas, which is made with white tea, has more body than this. I can make that in my 12 ounce mug and still have a good cup of tea. I don't see myself ever reordering this tea; it's just too strange a flavor and too weak for my taste. 2 stars.<br /><br />After further review I've found that just 2 drops of stevia made a difference in the flavor; made it more palatable. I also gave the teabag a good squeeze and that helped slightly. I raise my rating to 2.5 stars, rounded to 3.

Like another reviewer commented, I was underwhelmed.<br /><br />The other person in my family and I both agree on one thing, however, if you're expecting something like "a cup of hot cocoa", you will be disappointed.

review/text: I'll apologize up front that I'm no good at describing subtle tastes and aromas...but I'm drinking a cup as I type this to help me out.  :)<br /><br />I normally put some type of sweetener into tea, but I think that this is good just by itself - that's not unprecented, but it's pretty rare for me.  It has sufficient taste to it to keep me interested without sweetener, and it's not bitter (at least when steeped for 2.5 minutes).<br /><br />This has a hint of spice, IMO.  It's quite enjoyable.  Regarding the "chocolate" in the name, I honestly can't taste any at all...zero, zip.  The directions say to stir the cup as the chocolate might settle, but I still don't taste any.  Perhaps that's one of those subtle tastes that I'm not picking up on, but on the chance that you're like me, don't expect any chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Lack of chocolate aside, I like this a lot.  Overall, I enjoy this tea and recommend it.

review/summary: My favorite black tea
review/text: I'm a bit sensitive to the acids in black tea, but I'm trying to watch my sugar intake, so I don't want to sweeten it. This means that I find many black teas to be too harsh. Numi's Chocolate Puerh, however, is ideal for me. The very mild notes of vanilla, chocolate, and spices don't in any way overwhelm the black tea. Instead, they mellow and complement it. The result is a perfect cup of tea that makes it worth spending the extra for Numi. Even though, yes, the price tag does make me wince.

review/summary: Delicious, a bit subtle, but wonderful for blending with other teas
review/text: Chocolate and tea are not the most obvious combination, and yet this tea provides a soothing, harmonious experience that seems like the most natural thing in the world. The chocolate flavor isn't terribly strong, but the subtlety of it is part of the charm and what makes it work so well as a mid-afternoon or evening indulgence. Drink a cup of this tea slowly instead of snacking on a chocolate bar, and you may find that you're more relaxed, happier, and relieved at having saved calories for some other indulgence.<br /><br />And here's a hint: try combining this tea with another flavor. I sometimes brew a small pot of tea using a bag of this and a bag of The Republic of Tea's Strawberry Chocolate tea to really emphasize the chocolate flavor and add that delicious strawberry essence into the mix. The possibilities are pretty much endless, and this product makes a great base for a lot of happy experiments.

I do occasionally enjoy a simple cup of tea, usually brewed out of a bag, in a cup with some boiling water.  Nice and simple.  That being said, this is pretty good tea.  A little weak for my tastes but definitely with a plesant chocolate/vanilla flavor.  I can't say that I notice a big difference when compared to standard comparable store-bought teas.  It does smell very nice and makes a good after-dinner treat.

review/text: The description on the box sounded wonderful; hints of chocolate, vanilla, orange peel, cinnamon, and nutmeg, but I found the actual product to be rather flawed.  The tea leaves look far from the full leaves mentioned on the box, and there was also a fair amount of sedimentation from the bag.<br /><br />Moreover, the vanilla was extremely subtle, and I couldn't taste the chocolate or orange peel.  There was however a lot of cinnamon and nutmeg, which overpowered the other spices.  It tasted like a cinnamon tea, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is if you're marketing it a blend of spices.

I've been looking for a tea that will give me the same satisfaction as a nice hot cup of black coffee.  Numi Organic Chocolate Puerh just might be the one.  Normally I wouldn't put chocolate and tea together, but the result is quite satisfying.  The chocolate taste isn't overpowering, but instead gives the tea a subtle and earthy flavor.  In fact, a hot cup of this tea satisfies my late night sweet tooth.  I can't wait to try it with a cookie.

review/summary: Delicious, organic, & eco-friendly
review/text: This is a delicious tea with a nice blend of natural chocolate. The flavor of tea predominates, with the addition of a touch of chocolate and a hint of vanilla; it sounds like a weird combination, but works out rather well. The chocolate adds just a tad of weight to the flavor without making it taste at all thick. The taste worked well for me both with and without sweetener; but I think if you normally use sugar or other sweetener in your tea, as I do, you'll probably still want to do so.<br /><br />The packaging, as noted in the product description, is recycled; and this is altogether a product that will appeal to consumers with a conscience, whether it be with regard to what they put into their bodies, how they impact the environment, or how they affect the farmers. Regarding the packaging, each teabag is enclosed in its own biodegradable packet and has a tiny slit to help the consumer open it easily. I think the box, which is rather close in size to roughly similar items on the grocery shelves (Celestial Seasonings, Bigelow teas, etc.), is a little large to contain only 16 tea bags.

review/summary: Light tea with spice notes
review/text: Puerh tea is normally a traditional Chinese tea that has been aged and fermented. The teas are commonly sold in shaped bricks of compacted leaves.  The Yunnan region in China is well known to be a source of this tea.  This tea can often be found in varying vintages and sold according to a particular tree.  A one hundred year old tree can produce a flavor complexity different than a 50 year old tree.  Believe it or not, there are tea connoisseurs that can recognize the flavor profile from a particular tree.<br /><br />Numi tea brings to the mainstream US consumer market the looseleaf bagged sampling of this tea known for generations in China.  The tea has a mellower, rounded taste due to its aging and fermentation.  They have also added hints of spice so that you have subtle hints of chocolate, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.  It is not overwhelming in spice like many of the other "spiced" tea, but much more subtle.  It does not hit you over the head with spice notes like when you go into a department store during Christmas season.  But don't let the chocolate throw you off.  There is almost no discernible chocolate flavor, it is more of a scent.  If you enjoy black tea and want a bit more of a flavor and scent profile but find the mandarin spice or chai spice too overpowering, I strongly recommend this tea for you.

review/summary: Chocolatey Delicious
review/text: I have to confess that I'm a real fan of Numi teas. I haven't tried one yet that I haven't really enjoyed, and the Chocolate Puerh is the latest on my list of must-have teas.<br /><br />As teas go, I think this is really somewhere between a tea and a chai. The ingredients are puerh tea, cocoa powder, vanilla, theo chocolate cocoa nibs, rooibos, orange peel, nutmeg, and cinnamon. All organic, of course!<br /><br />The first think I noticed when I opened the foil wrapper was the cocoa smell. Mmm. First scent was good. I steeped the tea for about 4 minutes (they suggest 3-5 minutes) and took a sip. The flavor is definitely tea, but there's the deep undercurrent of cocoa reminiscent of holiday baking and childhood treats. I think the rooibos and orange peel add a nice sweetness and slight citrus to the mix, and the cinnamon doesn't overpower the rest of the ingredients. Numi does a good job of balancing flavors.<br /><br />The tea bag wrapper says "velvety & vanilla," and the tea does have a somewhat heftier mouthfeel than a regular cup of tea, probably because of the cocoa. I could drink this every day, but I'll probably savor it a couple of times a week as an after-lunch treat. If you like tea and chocolate, this is definitely worth a try.

review/summary: not much flavor
review/text: I shared this product with a person in my office who drinks tea daily.  (I'm a big coffee drinker, so I don't drink tea every day.)<br /><br />My initial impression was that while this tea smelled good once the bag was opened, the tea itself had almost no aroma once brewed and the tea didn't have much flavor either.  I thought that perhaps I had not brewed it long enough even though I had brewed it a full 5 minutes (the manufacturer recommends brewing 3-5 minutes), so I threw the bag back in my cup of tea.  Despite leaving the bag in the cup as I finished drinking the tea, the tea never got much flavor as far as I was concerned.  Then again I'm used to drinking really strong coffee, so I thought that perhaps my taste buds were simply used to a stronger flavor.<br /><br />Enter my co-worker.  I specifically did not tell her my impression of the tea because I wanted her unbiased opinion.  She was excited by the description of the tea on the box and brewed a cup for herself as she normally does every morning at the beginning of the work day.  She just stopped by my desk to give me her feedback.  Her main description of the tea was "bland."  She said it did not taste bad, but that it did not have much flavor.  In other words, her perception of this tea matched mine.  She further added that she would not buy this tea.  She didn't even want the rest of the box from me, so I'm simply going to put it out in our lunchroom in the hopes that perhaps some people where I work will enjoy it.  Who knows -- maybe this tea will impress at least one of my coworkers and they'll decide to purchase this tea.  I know I wouldn't.

review/summary: Hands down, my favorite tea!!!!
review/text: This is the first tea that I've had where I did not feel the need to add any sweetener whatsoever...no honey, sugar, cream, nothing!  I noticed many reviewers were unimpressed by the lack of chocolate flavor, but Numi never claims that this is hot chocolate.  It has a subtle, yet definite chocolate essence, and tastes wonderful whether it is hot or cold.  My favorite thing to do is drink tea while it's piping hot, and then whatever I don't have time to drink, I refrigerate and drink later with my meal.  This tea is perfect for that, and makes a nice (and healthy) alternative to a cold soda.  Numi, you hit it out of the ballpark with this one, and I will continue to drink and serve this tea for years to come!

review/summary: Eh.
review/text: Maybe I got a bad bag (possible, considering the other reviews), but this tea is pretty underwhelming.  This is my first experience with a chocolate tea, so I don't know what to expect, but I found this had a faint smell of chocolate and a very watery, very faint sweet taste--what that specific taste is, I couldn't say.  Will be trying yerba mate next and am hoping for a better experience.

review/summary: Too good to get a 3 rating, but not good enough to earn a 4 rating...
review/text: I had really high hopes for this tea. When it arrived in the mail I immediately opened up a pack and made some tea. It's not really what I expected. I thought it would have a slightly lighter and more chocolaty flavor. Don't get me wrong, its still a good drink. I think there's a little too much nutmeg that kind of throws it off. I would definitely urge people to give it a try because it is pretty good and has a distinct flavor

review/summary: Lofty goals for a tea!
review/text: "Numi's vision is to inspire well-being of mind, body, and spirit through the simple art of tea."  That's an awful lot for a tea to take on, but you have to give them credit for setting such a goal!  I can't say I was spiritually transformed by this tasty chocolate tea, but I can say it was soothing and pretty yummy.  There is enough chocolate and vanilla bean taste to satisfy a small chocolate craving, but not enough to make this tea sweet - at all.  It's a good way to have a small treat with hints of chocolate to end the day so you can avoid caloric damage from real chocolate treats.  I am not such a tea aficionado that I can comment on the tea quality beyond the fact that it is clearly not Lipton and this company is into image and producing a quality product.<br /><br />I go with 4 stars because, while tasty, this flavor is really not my - wait for it - cup of tea (sorry).

review/summary: Chocolate tea ?
review/text: Chocolate tea ? What a concept - two fabulous drinks in one cup.  Ah, but it might not be such a great idea as chocolate with coffee, because the "green" flavor of tea does not harmonize with the warm flavor of chocolate.  It's not bad, it's just not great.<br />Other Numi products are better.

review/summary: Not my "cup of tea"!
review/text: Let me start by saying I generally LOVE Numi teas and own a lot of them!  I've bought several of their "sampler" packs and enjoy the variety of flavors they offer.<br /><br />That being said, this is NOT one of my favorites!  In all fairness, I think maybe I just don't LIKE chocolate and tea together, because I also tried Trader Joe's brand of chocolate tea and thought it was nasty stuff.  I wouldn't say this is NASTY but it's certainly nothing I would actually purchase again.<br /><br />I like chai tea, and this sort of reminds me of it, but the chocolate notes in it just seem out of place to me - and I LOVE my chocolate!  Just not in tea, I guess.  I'll stick with their Earl Grey and Moonlight Spice, two of my all-time favorites in the Numi lineup!<br /><br />5-24-10 - I am updating my review!  My favorite restaurant serves Numi teas, and I decided to have some after dinner.  I asked the server which one she preferred, and she pulled the packet of Chocolate Puerh out of the box of assorted teas - she said, however, that it really needed cream and sugar to be GOOD!  So I took her advice, added a good splash of half & half and a packet of Splenda and you know - she was RIGHT!  It WAS good and just the right "dessert" after a big meal.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't throw out or give away the box I had - I dug around in the cupboard and found it and have been enjoying it at home ever since.  I do use heavy cream at home, which gives it an ever richer mouth-feel.  I will probably buy another box when this one is done.

review/summary: Smooth, chocolatey tea, with a high price tag
review/text: I am truly more of a coffee drinker, but I do enjoy tea sometimes. I have found that I really enjoy teas that have a chocolate flavor. They seem more rich and satisfying to me. One I had been enjoying is this one:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00113FULO">Good Earth Cocoa Chai, Black Tea, Cocoa And Spice, 18 Count Tea Bags, 1.43-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />It is good, and you could somewhat compare it with the one I am reviewing today.<br /><br />This one, the Numi tea, is even better. Richer, smoother and more full-flavored. I had company last weekend and several of my guests tried some and everyone wanted to take an extra teabag home. That said, it is very expensive compared to other chocolate teas, like the Good Earth brand. About 3 times as much per bag, comparing with the Good Earth subscribe & save price!<br /><br />I would not purchase this for every day, but it is definitely gift-worthy if you have tea lovers on your gift list this Christmas and want to get them something special. Even the box is lovely and special looking. I will be ordering some more for gifts, as well as some to keep around specifically for company. (I may have to hide it to keep it from disappearing in between company visits!). I can't afford it for everyday use--I'll probably keep buying the Good Earth for that--but this one will still have a place on my shopping list.

review/summary: If you like the delicate flavor of tea, look elsewhere.
review/text: Since I like tea and I love dark chocolate, I thought I would give this Chocolate Puerh tea a try.  I didn't know what to expect based on the description, but it was not at all what I would have liked it to be.<br /><br />Although I do regularly partake in some truly fine teas from Mighty Leaf, both loose and bagged, I don't consider myself an expert or a tea snob, but I do know what I like.  Properly filtered, clean water is important if you want to taste the tea and not whatever is in your water so I use water filtered by a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QR95CQ">PUR pitcher</a> for making tea.  I also use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CFQUGA">a glass cup</a>, so no undesireable flavor is introduced there.<br /><br />When I brewed my first cup, the first thing that came to mind is that it has a nice aroma, but it wasn't the aroma of tea... it was the aroma of weak cocoa.  I tried some without any type of sweetener and my impression was that the cocoa powder completely overwhelmed the flavor of the tea leaves.  It kind of tasted like a weak, bitter chocolate drink to me.  I've eaten raw cocoa nibs in the past and it reminded me of that... not at all pleasant since cocoa nibs are bitter.  I decided to add sugar to the tea to see if that would improve the flavor at least to the point where I would enjoy it and luckily it did.  My impression of the sweetened Chocolate Puerh was that it tasted just like a base for chai tea without the chai spices or the milk.  It's pleasant, but not at all like most of the flavored teas I've had in the past, the majority of which still retained some tea notes, whereas this tea does not.  Over the coming days, I brewed more of it and I came away with the same impression each time.  While I like it with sugar, I was not thrilled with it or blown away by it.  I'm not going to come home and crave a cup of this as opposed to say, a cup of Mighty Leaf <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E95KNS">Organic Earl Grey</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E95KOM">Mighty Leaf Vanilla Bean</a>, both of which are truly excellent flavored teas.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a tea I would order again.  Although it is okay, it just doesn't taste like tea as the cocoa completely masks the flavor of the underlying tea leaves and unlike a good chai tea, it does it in a way where the overall flavor isn't strong enough to satisfy or entice.  I feel like the brew is not quite like tea and its not quite cocoa and its not a chai.  Its stuck in the mediocre middle somewhere and what it does offer is just not desirable enough for me to want a more of it in the future.

review/summary: Chocolate aspect nicely nuanced
review/text: I was skeptical about this product - chocolate tea? How would that work?  I was very pleasantly surprised by this sophisticated tea.  First you taste a nicely spiced black tea, then subtly you begin to experience the chocolate taste. I liked it because the chocolate did not overwhelm the spicy tea flavors, but complemented them in an unexpected way. This is a unique tea to enjoy especially during the cold months. And it goes great with cookies!

review/summary: Chocolate Puerh -- A New Experience
review/text: After ordering this tea, I thought, "What was I thinking?" but I'm glad that I did order it. Trying to describe this tea is kind of like trying to describe Coca-Cola to someone that has never had it. There are definitely flavors of cocoa and nutmeg, but this isn't like drinking watered down cocoa.  While the flavors in this tea are familiar in themselves, the combination is unique and definitely worth a try.  I'm sorry that I can't better describe this tea....the Coke analogy kept running through my head as I thought about what I would write.  I do recommend this tea as an experience of something new and different.

review/summary: Strong and warming
review/text: Numi tea tends to be good tea, as a general rule.  This tea is a nice addition to Numi's repertoire.  It's a hearty tea, the kind that coffee drinkers would also likely enjoy.  The addition of the chocolate is a nice touch as it stands up well to the bold flavor of the puerh.  The cinnamon and nutmeg lend a warming effect to the tea and the combination brought to mind sitting in front of a warm fire during the holiday season.  There is some orange peel in the blend as well, but I didn't find the flavor of it to be noticeable.<br /><br />I drank my first cup black and found it quite enjoyable.  It was mildly sweet, thanks to the chocolate, but not overwhelmingly so.  The cinnamon created a sort of tingly sensation.  The second time around, I added two teaspoons of turbinado sugar and a splash of milk and found it equally enjoyable, though I don't really think the sweetener is necessary.  Still, the milk gave it a more velvety feel and the sugar brought out more of the chocolate taste and toned the cinnamon down a bit as well.  This is definitely one of those teas that can justifiably called "dessert in a cup".

review/summary: Nice Tea
review/text: I had to look up Puerh (from Wiki: Puerh tea (pronounced POO-urr) or Bolay tea is a type of tea made from a "large leaf" variety of the tea plant Camellia sinensis and named after Pu'er county near Simao, Yunnan, China).  It has a good balance of flavors, a little bit sweet so I'm assuming not calorie free.  The company is very "green" using recycled and biodegradable papers in their packaging and tea bags.  Also supporting fair trade with the tea farmers.  All around a good product from an upright company.

review/summary: Tasty way to try Puerh tea
review/text: I want to say off the bat that I'm not a fan of Puerh tea - the types I've tried so far have been very strong, with a heavy mushroom flavor, even when brewed lightly. "Earthy" is a word that's frequently used to describe Puerh.  Takes some getting used to, at the very least.  But Numi's chocolately version of Puerh is a big improvement - just as it's described on the box, it has a "velvety and vanilla" flavor - it's still a medium strong flavored tea, but the flavorings make it very palatable.<br /><br />It's best brewed with boiling water, for about 5 minutes, to get a deep chocolate flavor (and be prepared to stir occasionally while you drink it, so you can keep blending the chocolate, which can settle a bit at the bottom of the cup).<br /><br />I've also tried the loose version of this tea, and it is a bit stronger than the bagged version.<br /><br />I give this 4 stars mainly for reasons of personal taste, since I'm not 100% enthusiastic about Puerh in general, apart from this particular brand.  Also for those not in the know, Puerh can also have a bit of a "cleansing" effect (in terms of your digestive tract), so be aware this is probably not a tea you would want to drink in mass quantities on a daily basis. But as an occasional treat, or as a "dessert" tea, it's perfect.

review/text: I am smitten with this tea. First, the packaging is lovely. The design of the box, the fonts used...everything ids flawless and inviting.<br /><br />On to the actual TEA. I never expected a tea that had vanilla and chocolate as the main flavors to be this perfect, but it is. The chocolate is more of a hint, not like a thick uber-sweet chocolate taste. Just enough of a hint to set the tea apart from other more spicey flavors.<br /><br />I give this tea a HUGE thumbs up. Add it to you tea library and enjoy!

review/summary: YUMMY NUMI!
review/text: Wow! This is such a different type of tea experience. I like it plain but it is really yummy with some soy/almond milk and agave nector or other sweetener. It's Cacao flavor, not chocolate which gives it a different kind of taste. It doesn't taste too sweet at all, it's full bodied and satisfying. It feels so comforting to drink! The only improvements would be chai spice flavorings instead of the vanilla. Still, overall delish!
