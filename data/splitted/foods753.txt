review/summary: Good Health Olive Oil Potato Chips
review/text: Very good for a potato chip with salt on it. They were cooked in olive oil and they have sea salt on them. They are good for a change from the usual. They are very crispy. They seem to be a little bit thicker than most potato chips. Update: For my own personal use there is way too much salt. Sorry I can't handle all of the salt. But at least I tried them.

review/text: I am a big fan of salt and pepper chips, but had never heard of this brand.  I was curious and ordered a batch.  Exceeded my expectations.  Perfect blend of salt, pepper and olive oil.  Good crunch, not overwheleming.  I could eat a whole bag in a sitting, but theres enough in one 5oz bag to last you a few days. My local grocery store needs to stock these ASAP!  In the meantime, amazon has a good deal on these chips.

review/summary: Best chips ever!
review/text: I have been looking everywhere for olive oil and rosemary potato chips since my local Italian grocer stopped carrying them. Was so surprised when I accidentally ran across them at Amazon and haven't been able to stop eating them since they arrived. These are the best chips I think I have ever had--fresh, crunchy, lightly flavored with rosemary, and best of all--made with heart healthy olive oil. I know that olive oil doesn't outweight the negative of eating these chips---but who cares--they're awesome!

review/summary: Rosemary's Real
review/text: See our other review of the Good Health All Natural Kettle Style Olive Oil Potato Chips, Sea Salt.<br /><br />The rosemary in these light, scrumptious chips, is in fact, REAL (not an imitation). Just when we thought the rosemary is too much, the flavor disappeared and did not leave us with an aftertaste or unpleasant "snacking" feeling.  These chips are airy, delicious, seemingly healthier than others, and of course, highly recommended.

review/text: So you've bought "chocolate worms" at the grocery store, PLEASE do not assume this is that type of low quality product. This is the finest chocolate sprinkle you can find. The flavor is excellent and when you buy the big one, the price is most reasonable per ounce. I first bought these at a specialty market over a decade ago, and found them fabulous. My kids would even eat it by the spoonful. I use them as decoration on top of cakes, cookies, ice cream. I also bake with them. Add 1/3 cup to your brownies for a much superior flavor and moisture. I also use 1/3 cup instead of chocolate chips in cookie recipe and they are a big hit. I now buy the big containers and give them as gifts and EVERYONE I give one to is now as addicted as my family...you too can enrich you life with these yummies

Don't expect it to taste like a bowl of Ben and Jerry's.<br /><br />I am a 20 year-old male college student, I'm not exactly a calorie counter, and I still think this stuff is delicious.  I usually eat it with chocolate soy-milk.  The flakes are extra-crunchy.  Much more crisp and substantial than say, frosted flakes (they stay crispy longer as well), but not terribly sweet.  Yeah, the chocolate is pretty lame if you eat the pieces by themselves (although I wouldn't call it "gross" at all) but when you eat it with the flakes, this cereal tastes pretty great.

review/summary: A healthier alternative to the kiddie chocolate cereals
review/text: This is not an overwhelmingly chocolatey cereal, like many of the kid cereals.  It does have a chocolate taste that is reminiscent of Cocoa Pebbles to me.  I love chocolate, but I also love fitting into my pants, so this is a great compromise.  It's got enough of the little chocolatey squares to make it sweet and to satisfy my chocolate craving, and I actually do quite enjoy the crunch wheat and rice flakes; they stand up quite well in milk.  One caveat: this is NOT real chocolate, hence the title of Chocolatey Delight (rather than Chocolate Delight).  This is made of out partially hydrogenated soybean oil rather than cocoa butter and solids, which does add .5 g of the dreaded trans fat per serving (despite the fact that the nutrition label says 0 trans fat; you only see it at the bottom of the list of ingredients).  It doesn't quite taste like real chocolate, but neither does any other breakfast cereal that I've ever tasted.  I did not find it to be waxy, so maybe that's just a personal taste issue.  It's quite good, however, and has earned a place on the top of my refrigerator for those days when I'm seriously craving chocolate at night but don't want to blow the day's diet.  Give it a try for yourself; I really enjoy it!

review/text: I saw a box of this on sale at a local store, so I thought I'd try it before committing to an Amazon subscription pack.<br /><br />It's a decent version of Special K, with tiny little bars of chocolate mixed in with a good ratio. Still, the problem with having actual chocolate in the cereal rather than baked into it is that once the chocolate comes into contact with the cold milk, it hardens and you end up with the typical chunky chewed up bits of chocolate you get when eating chocolate and drinking milk. The chocolate bits sink to the bottom and so while you can keep your ratio nicely proportional by making sure to scoop the bottom, if you're not paying attention you can end up with a bunch of little chocolate bars.<br /><br />So while it tastes good, it's not good enough for me to want to buy it regularly.

review/summary: This cereal rocks, I have to agree that the bad reviewers are crazy! lol
review/text: I have been eating this cereal since it first came out. It absolutely helps me curb those late night cravings, which is my most vulnerable time for eating unhealthy. It satisfies the crunchy & chocolaty cravings.<br /><br />Yes the chocolate pieces sink to the bottom of the bowl, but this is usually when you have only a few spoonfuls left, otherwise the flakes help hold the pieces up ontop. I actually like that at the end I get a spoonful of like 5-6 pieces of chocolate. The Chocolate does have a "waxy" type coating...but thats so it doesnt melt in the box during transportation...I have never had a negative opionion or even thought about the texture of the chocolate before I read the negative reviews here, but that's because it just tasted good and I enjoy the taste and texture. So I have to disagree with the negative comments on the chocolate pieces...sure, it's not quite like biting into some Dove chocolate, but this cereal tastes great and satifies a chocolate fix with less fat and calories that Dove chocolate!<br /><br />The cereal is made with whole grains and does provide some fiber, I use the cereal as more of a chocolate snack than as a meal for breakfast. I prefer higher fiber content in my breakfast, helps keep me fuller longer so I don't snack all day. So while this cereal is perfect for a late night fix as it has the crunchy and chocolate craving satisfaction down...I think there are much healthier breakfast cereals out there like Kashi or high fiber oatmeal! Other than that this cereal tastes awesome and has helped me lose weight by giving me a better choice for my cravings. :)<br /><br />My husband also loves this cereal, he is often "stealing" a bowl of it when he's home, so I started buying 2 boxes at a time, when I saw the price on Amazon I about flipped! I pay the same amount for 2 boxes at my grocery store as the Amazon Subscribe and Save for 4 boxes! Twice the amount for the same price, yes, please! Love Amazon!

review/summary: Chocolate doesn't really go with cereal and is a bit waxy
review/text: The first time I tried this cereal was when I bought a sample pack sort of thing of Special K. My first impression was pretty good. This time around, I wasn't as impressed. Don't get me wrong, it's a good tasting cereal, but it doesn't really work. The combination of chocolate and cereal isn't that great. Also, as some other reviews pointed out, the chocolate is a bit waxy. It's not a big deal, and it makes sense considering that they need to make it so it doesn't melt in the milk, but still it's not necessarily pleasant. Out of the whole Special K range, this is the 4th best, falling behind the vanilla/almond, berry/yogurt, and strawberry.

review/summary: Not Really Chocolatey or Delightful
review/text: One of my least favorite Special K cereal. It's definitely edible but don't expect it to be "chocolatey" or "delightful." I read the other reviews and thought I'd give this 3.5-star cereal a try anyway. The rice/wheat flakes itself are less sweet than those in their Red Berries Special K Cereal. I guess they sprinkle them with less sugar to compensate for the "chocolate." The chocolate is 1) not melty, 2) sinks to the bottom, 3) taste close to semi-sweet chocolate morsels but 90% less melty, 4) hard. The chocolate chips reminds me the Ex-Lax (laxative) chocolate. I just eat the flakes and throw away the chocolate; they edible (not disgusting) but I don't find them enjoyable to eat.

review/summary: Too much bland chocolate
review/text: This cereal is pretty good, as far as healthy(ish) cereals go.  But I was overwhelmed by the amount of chocolate pieces in the box.  I find myself picking out about half of them each time I pour a bowl.  They are also bland tasting - not like I expected at all.  I am disappointed that at the taste of the chocolate and that are are so many pieces, which I assume is because of the weight of them.  A box of regular Special K that has the same weight is considerably larger than this box because the heavy chocolate takes up so little space.  Even if the chocolate were great tasting, the chocolate pieces to flake ratio is way off.  I might purchase them again, but only if I find them on sale for a great price.  If not, I can easily live without them.

review/text: I like Special K and I love chocolate so when I saw the two together I thought, why not try it? Well, I did and I love this cereal! I could eat this for every meal of the day. But something that I found out when I first tried this cereal: don't pick out the chocolate pieces to eat separately because they'll taste funny to you. You have to eat the cereal all together because the flakes have a little chocolatey flavor to them and it adds to the flavor of the chocolate pieces. So if you love Special K and chocolate, you should give this cereal a try.

review/text: I am a huge Special K fan. Especially Red Berry, but at heart I am a chocoholic. I was so excited to hear they had a chocolate version and I ran right out to try it. It is your average Special K flakes but with the addition of "Chocolate Pieces". The problem is they leave a horrible waxy coating in your mouth because of the poor quality chocolate. I am sure this is because it has to stay healthy but I would rather have a Fat Free Chocolate Jello 100 calorie pack then deal with the feeling it leaves in your mouth. So back to red berry for me!

review/text: I like special K cereal. I like the bars, too. But this flavor of their cereal is just gross. The flakes are alright on their own, but the pieces of chocolate are totally unedible. They are big waxy chunks, and you can barely taste any chocolate flavor in them. I don't know what they are made out of, but it's not real chocolate. They get stuck to your teeth and you just have a mouth full of brown waxy bits by the time you're done with a bowl of this cereal. I'm a huge cereal fan, and an even BIGGER chocolate fan, and you couldn't pay me to eat another bowl of this crap!

review/summary: hate to complain....BUT.....
review/text: Well, we gave it a shot.  (reveiwed after 4 out of 5 in our household wasn't pleased)<br />-the concept was a good one...add some chocolatey goodness to a special K cereal...However, it FAILED!  Out of our house, only the 6 year old liked it.  Why?  because it was literally like sticking little chocolate candy bars on your cereal IN THE MORNING.  Now, who doesn't like their regular chocolate cereal? WE all do, we love coco krispies and such...However, this was not the same.  There were mini chocolate bars in a 'healthy' tasting cereal.  It just doesn't quite mix.  Then you add milk on top of those chocolate bars and it was just hard to eat.  My husband other children didn't want any more (and he had bought 4 boxes)  It was too much for the morning time.  Maybe if I bag this up and stick it in someones lunch box they will see it as a wonderful treat in the afternoon (and since NO ONE HERE WILL EAT IT for breakfast, I may just have to do that).<br />We are big fans of most of the Special K cereals (the yogurt clusters is our fav and a staple item in our house).  This won't stop us from trying more, just not gonna add any chocolate candy bars to our cereal again anytime SOON!

review/text: The boxes arrived undamaged but when I opened the box to eat the cereal, the chocolate pieces had all melted due to the extreme summer heat during shipment in the UPS trucks and, as a result, it was large solid chunks of chocolate matted with the flakes so, even with milk, the cereal was not edible. Apparently, certain items should not be shipped during the summer heat.

review/summary: Could use some improvement, but still very good
review/text: This cereal smells like chocolate when you open the box, but taste? The chocolate pieces have no taste. Too bad, too. It could've been good. I don't know what they use, but it says it has cocoa. I can taste chocolate in everything else I eat, so it's not me. I like the flakes all right and when you open a fresh box, the flakes with some ice cold milk are real light and crunchy. They just need to improve the chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Update: 2/11/12<br />Either they made it better or I've gotten used to the taste of the chocolate! :) I also found adding a half packet of Truvia helps bring out the chocolate flavor. And it does say "chocolatey pieces" not "chocolate pieces." Yes, it's waxy, but now I brush my teeth AFTER breakfast ;) You get used to it. Personally, I like that the chocolate pieces are on the bottom. It's kinda like the surprise in the cracker jacks box. If that bothers you, just use a flatter bowl. All in all, it's not perfect, but it's still my favorite cereal. :)

review/text: So some people didn't like that weird feeling the chocolate left in your mouth that people mentioned as a "waxy" feeling, but I personally enjoyed the taste of this a lot, and I bought this quite a bit until I realized there's trans-fat in the cereal.<br /><br />In the ingredients, the cereal contains "PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL", which for those who may not know, but anything "hydrogenated" contains a very small amount of trans-fat.<br /><br />It may only be less than .5 grams and so in the nutrition panel, they can show that there's 0 trans fat in the cereal, but if you had 3-4 servings of chocolatey delight, you could very well be eating 1-2 grams of trans-fat. Just be forewarned.<br /><br />Anyways, give the cereal a try if you haven't, and don't just think you'll hate the taste of it just because others didn't like the taste of it because I enjoyed the flavor of the cereal very much.

review/summary: You can do better than this, Pacific Foods!
review/text: I am no stranger to Pacific Foods or soup products in general.  I eat a lot of this manufacturer's items and I consume many varieties of soup.  Of late, Pacific Foods has been producing many new flavors of soups that lack attention to taste and consumer friendly packaging.  This rosemary potato chowder is one of these newer soups and it was a big disappointment for me.<br /><br />My dislike of this soup began with the packaging.  It is one of those fold and tear type of cartons where you pop the sides up and take a knife or pair of scissors and cut off the top to remove the contents.  These cartons are not consumer friendly.  It is difficult to remove the product without some of the contents spilling as you tear off the top.  Pacific has soup containers which come with a capped spout.  The capped spout on other containers allows the consumer to pour what they need and refrigerate the rest.  Alas, with this container, you need to pour all of the contents and put what you don't need into a tupperware dish -- thus creating more dirtied dishes in your life.<br /><br />The second disappointment was the appearance upon pouring.  I definitely eat food first with my eyes.  When I poured the soup into a bowl, there were giant curds intermingled with oily broth, carrots and celery.  This soup is made with milk so I am guessing that was what caused the curds.  I had to use a whisk to break them up.  After heating the soup, the base was still very oily.  See a photo of the soup in the product image gallery.<br /><br />The third disappointment was the taste and texture of the soup.  The soup is oily, filmy and I don't think it is thick enough to be called a chowder.  The manufacturer was very light on the use of rosemary.  I wouldn't call this a rosemary potato chowder.  I would call this flavored liquid with some finely diced potatoes and a dash of rosemary.<br /><br />The fourth disappointment was the nutritional profile.  This container has 2 one cup servings.  Each one cup serving has 230 calories, 8 grams of fat, 25% of your daily saturated fat (5 grams) and 30% of your daily sodium.  See a shot of the nutritional profile in the product image gallery.<br /><br />If you have the time, I would make your own potato soup.  Imagine Soup carries a large line of soup bases, including a potato flavor.  If you add potatoes, onion, carrots and some spices, you will have a soup that is much more texturally appealing, flavorful and nutritional (that soup base has 110 calories per cup).<br /><br />This product is vegetarian.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States.

It wasn't as good as some of their other chowders, and even though it was a lot of food, it wasn't satisfying.<br /><br />Since the flavor was potato rosemary I expected those to be the predominant flavors.  And they were to an extent, especially the rosemary.  There definitely was that piney flavor that permeated the soup.  The potatoes took a back seat though and while they represented most of the texture, they didn't really have that potato-like taste.  I also thought it was somewhat watery and nothing like the texture of a chowder at all.  There were other vegetables included, but you really couldn't taste them.  Another note on the texture, I encountered some rosemary sprigs that were tough to chew.  It didn't bother me, but I know it bothers a lot of people.<br /><br />The ingredients were pretty good.  Only a few things are in this including water, potatoes, cream, onion, celery, carrot, cornstarch, sea salt, garlic, rosemary, and natural flavor.  So really, not that much at all.  Which is good, I hate when they add fillers and at least with sea salt it's a healthier salt than normal.  Calorie wise its about 230 per serving, and there are two servings in the box.  I of course ate both servings since I had nowhere to store the rest at work, but even so it made up a pretty large portion that I almost couldn't finish.  It just wasn't satisfying as said before.  Fat is 8 grams per serving and sodium 730 mg per serving.  There are some vitamins, but I don't think they were added in intentionally, just a product of the food contained within.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this flavor again.  Too watery and the taste wasn't that fantastic.  I'll stick to the other flavors from the brand.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: No shortage of potatoes in this mild, comforting soup.
review/text: I think this is one of the better gluten-free soups available. If you heat it thoroughly, it looks just fine. There are LOTS of chunky potatoes and the flavor is mild but pleasant. Many other gluten free soups are overly spiced with flavor combinations that don't always work together.  I do love highly spiced foods, but sometimes I just want a soup that is gentle and comforting, like this one. Of course, if you don't love potato soup to begin with, it probably won't make you happy.

review/summary: Not good
review/text: I was very disappointed in this soup. I was excited to try it being as I love potato chowder and rosemary. First of all, I tasted little if any rosemary in this runny soup. While there was plenty of potatoes they were diced very small and were somewhat grey in color.This is my first time trying Pacific Natural Foods soups and I will not buy this again. I have some of their Thai Sweet Potato soup to try. I only hope it is better.<br />One week later.....<br />I tried the Thai Sweet Potato Soup. It was worse. At least I could eat the Rosemary Potato Chowder,the Thai Sweet Potato went in the trash

review/summary: good for hash brown casserole
review/text: I used this soup instead of cream of chicken or potato soup in the hash brown casserole with the sour cream, cheese, onion, butter...to make it gluten free. It actually worked very well and the consistency worked similar to cream of chicken soup. My daughter actually likes this soup and the clumps discussed in previous reviews disappear when heating.

review/summary: Great flavor - amazing value
review/text: The Infamous Goose is a very inexpensive Sauvignon Blanc, at about $10 per bottle, but it packs in flavor. As is typical of this variety from Marlborough, New Zealand it is very citrus-y:  the flavor of grapefruit hits you at once and continues to the bottom of the glass. Others with perhaps more refined palates taste a variety of different fruits, lemongrass and honey --  but to me it's grapefruit all the way. It's got good body, and is a wonderfully fresh drink, one that goes with a wide variety of foods.  You can hardly beat the price - try it once and then buy a case!

There was none.<br />I did more research, one of which found: [...].<br />Destiny water is nowhere to find.  Strongly recommend learning about this company and its water before ordering it, AND ordering it on Amazon!

review/summary: good water
review/text: I like the bottle that this water comes in, it's a harder type of plastic, so it doesn't crush in your hand like many of the other brands.  I gave it only 4 stars because of the sodium content.  You must be careful if you are on a low sodium diet and factor the sodium content of this water in.  I make coffee with it, in my Keurig, and it seems to work fine and the coffee tastes really good.  I also love that it's a larger bottle, but still fits into my car drink holders.  It also has magnesium in it, but most people don't get enough of that mineral so it's negligible.  It has actually helped me lose weight, I think the sodium in it keeps me from craving salty foods during that time of the month when all us ladies are craving either salt or sugar lol.

review/summary: Pop Up Bowl is Terrible
review/text: The bowl bag does not pop in the same amount of time as a normal bag so it makes your microwave's popcorn button useless. Additionally, about half of the bags are faulty and open when popping resulting in very little popped popcorn. Last, I have found it almost impossible to get the bag to pop completely even when watching it pop (since I can't use the popcorn button!). Overall, this new bowl design is terrible and I would recommend switching to another brand until they go bag to the old bags that work.

review/summary: ..back to kicking Jif's butt!
review/text: I bake a lot of peanut butter cookies.  Plus everyone in the house, dogs included eat peanut butter, so you might say we're connoisseurs of a sort.  I always have A LOT of peanut butter on hand.  It goes quickly, so freshness is never an issue.<br /><br />Today, because I happen to have both brands, I felt like a pb and crackers taste off lunch.  Right off the top, no hesitation, Skippy kicked Jif's butt.<br /><br />First the color and texture: Skippy hands down.  Thick, beautiful, bold golden peanut density.  Quality.  The peanuts taste like they're very fresh.  That little Skippy swirl on the top, you could see the color differentiation.  The speckles of the nuts.<br /><br />Jif was okay.  Nothing to write home about.  Thin.  Color VERY uniform.  Like everything was mashed to a pulp.  Maybe that makes a difference.  I don't know.<br /><br />A couple of years ago, Jif cornered the market with an intense deliciousness and peanut flavor and it's molasses sweetening.  I don't know what happened..but it's thinner and the molasses is gone.<br /><br />Skippy rules.

review/text: I've been using Evanger's Whitefish/Sweet Potato for my 7-year old Cavalier KC Spaniel. She's got terrible IBD and has to eat the limited-ingredient dog foods. I had been buying the Prescription ID from my vet, and it was fine, but it wasn't always convenient to get to the vet's when I needed the food. On the strength of advice from a woman who had 3 dogs with various stomach issues (none of her dogs was a pure breed, so it's not just for expensive, overbred dogs like mine!) I tried it for my dog and we haven't gone back to the Prescription brand. Yes, it's more expensive than grocery store dog food, but it's a little less expensive than the vet-prescribed food. And, I've saved in further vet and medication costs b/c her stomach isn't churned up by other brands. It's well worth the cost. Get a small bag to start, and go from there!

review/text: This is a huge container of sliced dried mushrooms.  They are flavorful and not too many broken pieces.  If you are buying them in the little one ounce pouches, compare the price and try these.  They last a long time in the original container.  I find myself reconstituting them to add to pizza, risotto, soups and omelets.  They do need some time to plump up in very warm water, and then need to be cooked because the texture is not the same as a raw mushroom. Save the liquid for use as a flavor base in recipes.  I really did not notice any quality difference between these and other brands in the small packs.

review/summary: Taste like graham crackers
review/text: These cookies are great for kids snacks and for adults. But be careful, cus a little can get out of hand! I ate half of box while snacking and watching tv one night. Plus on auto ship, they are a great bargain.
