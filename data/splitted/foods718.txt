review/summary: My most favorite coffee Great flavor no acid taste
review/text: I am so sorry to hear that the Tully's Kona blend will not be available due to the drought conditions in HI and that they will be doing a replacement blend with different polynesian locations.<br />I have really enjoyed this blend. For me it has a medium body with a wonderful taste and low acidity.<br />I hope the replacement is like this also.

review/summary: My Fovorite
review/text: First off...  100% Kona coffee is my favorite and I have had plenty of 100% Kona from Kona Hawaii in the last 20 years.  This is not 100% Kona but it does have a great flavor.  I like it better than any other Kona currently available in the K-cup.  Unfortunately Green Mountain coffee (Tully) has discontinued this k-cup not sure if it is temporary or permanent?  Green Mountain simply told me that at this time there is no plans on bringing it back!  Bad idea, I have talked to numerous people that also call Tully's Kona their favorite.  If you can find it then try it.

review/summary: Best Coffee Hands Down!
review/text: Tully's Kona is our favorite K-Cup! Took some to the office and now most are hooked on it also. You can't beat the taste. However, about 2 cups is enough caffeine for most. It's somewhat hard to find in stores as stock usually goes fast. It's nice to be able to buy it in bulk on Amazon.

review/summary: The same as any other dark roast k-cup
review/text: I drink a lot of k-cups due to the fact that my work has the machines and provides a great assortment of flavors. I would compare the Kona k-cups to just about any other k-cup that's medium or dark roast. It's a decent flavor, but a huge disappointment because I was overly optimistic that it would taste closer to real kona that is fresh brewed a more traditional way.<br /><br />If you aren't expecting too much, this is a decent cup of coffee. If you want anything close to authentic kona taste, you need fresh beans and not freeze-dried plastic cups. If your only experience with kona is this stuff, you're missing out on a great cup of coffee at a decent price.

review/text: This product lists equivalency in drops, yet the packaging is not a dropper style bottle nor does it have any type of dropper applicator. The equivalency is also very wrong, it is not nearly as sweet as it labels itself to be. It also has a bitter after-taste that I have not had with other sucralose based liquid sweeteners.

review/summary: Holy steak batman!
review/text: I used to grill mys steaks and use my own spices from scratch. When my friends would come over for a cook out they would ask what I was using and I wouldn't tell them, pretending it was a secret. Then, one day, I went to my friend's cook out and I swear I tasted my own steaks. When I told him that he just laughed and threw me the bottle of Montreal Steak spice. The coarse salt, black and red pepper, garlic, sunflower oil, and paprika were the spices that is in this bottle that I used all the time.  I was actually happy that someone came up with the idea to pre mix all of these spices because it really is a time saver. This really gives steaks, burgers, chicken, and even potatoes a little bit of zest to the flavor. I have also tried the spicy version, but nothing beats the original recipe. Just wish I would have bottled it first. Great product!

review/summary: Burgers, Steaks, Chicken + Mccormick Montreal Seasoning = Amazing
review/text: Mccormick Montreal seasoning is one of the simplest, best tasting, and versatile seasoning on the planet for virtually any meat. It's awesome on burgers and steaks, but it's also very good on chicken, vegetable kabobs, pork chops, and virtually any other meat. I mix it with soy sauce for burgers, and consistently get asked by my guests what the secret is. They can't believe it when I tell them how simple it is! I also use this in the broiler with a little olive oil with great results.<br /><br />There are few ready made seasonings that I will use when I grill (I prefer to use homemade dry rubs or marinades) and this is one of them. It is the best of the best, and I can heartily recommend it for grilling.

review/summary: Nice touch for dishes
review/text: I first came across this product watching one of Rachael Ray's "30 Minute Meal" shows. I thought the recipe was nice, so I picked up a container of McCormick's Montreal Steak seasoning.  And I've continued to use it since.<br /><br />It is especially nice when grilling, as its placement in the "Grill Mates" line would suggest. I use it on hamburgers, on steaks, and on pork when I grill out.  I also will use it when baking or frying such meats inside.<br /><br />It adds a nice little bite to the taste.<br /><br />Components? Coarse salt, spices (such as black and red pepper), garlic, paprika, and sunflower oil. Simple ingredients, but they work well together and end up adding a pleasant taste to whatever one might be cooking.<br /><br />So, I'm a fan and recommend this to those who would like a little something extra on their meat.

review/text: A snickers is a snickers, not much to say about it.<br />However, the expiration date is for three Months from now which tells me that these snickers have been sitting in the warehouse for many Months already.<br />When I bite into the snickers it is quite obvious that this candy is not fresh at all...(ex: the caramel is not chewy, the chocolate flakes off into pieces when I bite into it telling me it is stale, etc.)<br /><br />I have been shopping on line for well over 10 years due to my being disabled, and I don't drive so I do almost all of my shopping on line, including, most of my food.<br />This has been the slowest shipping I've ever experienced with a seller...<br />So, let's see, I have very slow shipping from the seller, add to that the snickers are almost out of date and very stale, (in fact  I am going to toss them into the trash), I am left with a very terrible experience with this seller...what a rip....seller must be judeo/christian as money seems to be the bottom line!<br /><br />So needless to say I'll never, ever use this seller again, I would rather go without!<br /><br />Edit: problem is NOT with Amazon, I love shopping on Amazon, the problem is with D+J.<br />Amazon issued a refund for the stale candy....Amazon is the best!

They are of excellent quality and come in nice plastic jars resembling large spice jars for parsley and such.<br /><br />The seeds sprout uniformly and well, with negligible "junk", and are very tasty.  In comparison, I had a very bad experience in buying seeds from another seller/producer that came in a cheap plastic bag that spilled all over the box and arrived in a black plastic trash bag from the post office.  The quality/uniformity of those other seeds was nowhere near these from The Sprout House.<br /><br />If I am buying alfalfa sprouting seeds, I will ONLY buy these.

review/summary: Great seeds, delicious sprouts!
review/text: I just love alfalfa sprouts on sandwiches; however, over the months. I found that alfalfa sprouts were being sold less and less in the local food markets.  It is my belief that the reason is simply that they do not have a long enough shelf life.  It was this reason that I went online to Amazon and purchased this product. Knowing that seeds have a long shelf life, I stored it in my cabinet until I had the courage to learn how to sprout at home.  It was a You Tube video that gave me the courage to begin sprouting.  I do not know why it took so many decades for me to learn how to home sprout.  Alfalfa sprouts usually take about three days or so to mature, and require no more than watering and rinsing with the final hours on the window sill for Mother Sun.  The sprouts stay fresh much longer than I imagined because they are processed at home and are so very delicious.  I highly recommend buying this vendor's seeds.  They are perfect.  One pound of alfalfa seeds lasts a long time.  I guarantee that you will love sprouting seeds as I now do.  Thank you so much for the lessons!  I just finished sprouting a new batch and had to come back online to sincerely thank The Sprout House!

review/text: For some reason I am not getting a very high germination rate with these seeds.  It seems that about 25% do not sprout.  I soak them for 8 hours at first then rinse them every morning and evening.  Maybe I got a bad batch or maybe they are old seeds but I will order from someone else next time.<br /><br />I would like to update this review.  I believe the problem I had with these seeds had to do with the weather.  I live in a humid area of Brazil.  When I first started using these seeds it was summer here and I had a poor germination rate.  Now the weather has cooled and I am getting a very good germination rate.  Although I rinsed these twice a day and the weather was very humid, it could be that they dried out too much.  I would not be afraid to purchase these again and I am sorry if I caused anyone not to purchase these with my previous review.  If I can I will change my rating to 5 stars.  I always try to be honest and if I make a mistake I try to correct it.  I count a lot on the reviews of others when I make a purchase so I want mine to be correct.  Enjoy.

review/summary: Dramatic Price Increase
review/text: As a vegetarian I enjoy having fresh alfalfa sprouts growing in my<br />kitchen. I have made several purchases of these particular seeds from<br />the Sprout House and can highly recommend them. I use glass jars and<br />plastic lids with openings that I purchased in the 1980s specifically<br />for growing sprouts. These seeds grow well and taste great.<br /><br />I last purchased a pound of Sprout House Organic Alfalfa Sprouting<br />Seeds in late September 2011 for $9.50. That price included Free<br />Shipping with an Amazon order over $25.00. Now in January 2012<br />the price for the exact same seeds is $14.50 with the same free<br />shipping terms.<br /><br />I read here and there that the US economy is finally on the rebound<br />so perhaps that accounts for the nearly 53% price increase in four<br />months. Or possibly I was fortunate to get a bargain price in 2010<br />and 2011 with my Sprout House purchases and the regular price<br />has usually been at the higher $14.50 level.<br /><br />This is a good food product. One star is subtracted due to the almost<br />53% increase in price I encountered when I recently considered placing<br />a new order. That substantial increase caused me to postpone my<br />purchase. (For anyone who may be curious, I still have several<br />pounds of seeds in my refrigerator).

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: The seeds came with a lot of little black seeds mixed in with the alfalfa seeds.  We have no idea what the little black seeds are, and they don't germinate when we sprout the alfalfa seeds.  One thing for sure is they shouldn't be there.  We're very disappoint in this vendor.

review/summary: This makes a TON of sprouts!
review/text: At first I was a little sad to see how small the container was and thought "Is this really a pound?"  Well it is, and so far it has made tons of sprouts and hardly put a dent in the bottle of seed. The flavor on these is great and tastes way better than the crap you get at the grocery store. Also if you keep them in the fridge in a sealed container with a paper towel underneath them, they last at least a week without getting slimy. They usually don't last that long though!

review/text: Wow very fast shipping!  Package arrived as stated in description.  Mine came sealed and clearly marked in a nice clear plastic container.  New to sprouting but looking forward to this new project.  The kids will enjoy it too!  Can't wait to use the sprouts on salads and sandwiches.  I plan to order more, probably get the hot and spicy mix too.  I found some nice individual mason jars at the dollar store of all places.  I am using a kitchen dish cloth cut and fit to cover the top and it drained nicely while containing all of the seeds in the jar.  Testing how many to grow at a time, so if there are too many I will transplant into another jar to continue growing.

review/text: These products ship fast. Everyone one we purchased sprouted the first time. While they do recommend some other sprouters we are actually using the Easy Green Automatic Sprouter. Every product purchased from the Sprout House sprouted the first time. We'll continue to purchase until we figure out how to harvest our own although I never seem to have enough time in the day and a bottle of these sprout seeds will go a long way.

It germinates quickly and they are very tasty. I love to use them on my sandwiches and have gone to the fridge and grabbed a handful just to eat. I love the flavor of these sprouts.

review/summary: Love Jiffy Pop but check the expiration first
review/text: I have loved making Jiffy Pop since I was a kid and have since made it a point to share the fun with my own 2 children. It is getting almost impossible to find this stuff so I was really glad to find it here. I eagerly placed an order back at the end of July 2008.<br /><br />My order arrived quickly and was packaged nicely. I was super excited to see so much yummy jiffy pop all in one box. Upon closer examination however, I realized that the expiration date was the first week of October 2008. My kids and I love Jiffy Pop but making/eating 24 servings in just a little over 2 months was going to be an impossible task! I ended up giving several of them away to friends and family before they became too stale to eat.<br /><br />So the deal was great and I will likely try again but just be sure to ask about the expiration date before you order so you ensure that you get that great *fresh* Jiffy Pop taste!

review/summary: Delicious Way of Making Popcorn
review/text: I sipped Chardonnay one Saturday as a lone Jiffy Pop package laid relaxed on my counter, waiting for heat. As the evening gave way to night, and the wine found its better home, I found in my moonlit kitchen that I was its suitor. I had fire.<br /><br />Like Chopin finding music, I discovered inspiration that brightened and enlightened my heart. Thoughts of hot corn, popped into a new shape, tickling my tongue, excited me into a rush. Heating the aluminum, shaking it from many angles, I danced, my smile shining up from the polyurethane floor.<br /><br />For a minute, maybe two, nothing, until the first kernel said hello, rebirthing from harsh and hard to kind and soft.<br /><br />The foil rustled softly like a fresh-pressed cotton sundress, as popping corn made its plea of escape. More, then silence. Escape was found with my lacerating finger piercing and pulling open its silver veil. Steam now relieved, I bathed in the scent of butter, until a wispingly swift move delivered me from wanting to eating.<br /><br />Try Jiffy Pop. May you too have fire when the Jiffy Pop needs heat.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/text: Wow, really? What was Pepperidge Farm thinking when they created these? Seriously, they remind me of the awful taste left in you mouth after having a bout of the stomache flu. I wasn't the only one. My husband took them to work & co- workers came to the same conclusion with no influence or comments from him. Normally Pepperidge Farm products are so good, tasty & downright delicious. Save your money. The ONLY thing they have going for them is crunch & that I was able to eat only ONE. There is no possibility for craving or overeating them. Uncertain what the other flavors taste like, but would steer clear of Fiesta Cheddar.<br /><br />I wanted to try the chili lime but after this one think we will skip it.

review/text: Just purchased these at my local grocery store and would recommend them. The flavor is really unique almost reminds me of a seasoning you'd put on grilled chicken. They show a red pepper on the box which led me to think maybe they'd have a spiciness to them...not at all. If you can get them at your local store, i'd buy them there ( bought a couple at 2.99 a box.)Love anything pepperidge farm and definitely suggest these crackers to eat anytime!

review/summary: Great stuff but . . ..
review/text: Truly a great sweetener however the travel packets are simply too big. Part of my profession involves traveling so when I saw the packets I immediately bought a box. The problem is that the packets have an equivalent of two teaspoons and that is simply too much sweetness for my taste.<br />"Just use half" you might say. OK but what do you do with the leftover sweetener? The packets cannot be resealed and this stuff is as sticky as honey. It cannot go into your pocket so it has to be thrown away.<br />At over $14 per box one must throw away $7 worth just to use the packets. No thanks I'll use Splenda till they make one teaspoon packets.

review/summary: Great in more then just flavor!!!!
review/text: After becoming a little more aware of what ingredients I put in my body and being an avid griller, I picked out Stubb's Spicy BBQ sauce because it does NOT have high fructose corn syrup in it, which is RARE! It seems like almost all of the other BBQ sauces have HFCS. Stubb's brand was around $5.50, a lot more expensive then the mainstream brands like KC Masterpiece and Sweet Baby Rays.<br /><br />I'm glad I spent the couple extra bucks on this because it is GOOD!!! It is a little spicy, but it is delicious!! This is the only brand of BBQ sauce I buy now if I do buy BBQ sauce. About 95% of the time I make my own BBQ sauce, but when I'm feelin' lazy, I reach for a bottle of Stubb's! Great BBQ sauce! Worth checkin' out if you're looking for a healthier alternitive to your regular BBQ sauce!

I suppose I could add some more, being a salty snack lover, but that is my only complaint.  Otherwise, it's a yummy snack and crunchy additive to other lunch foods.

review/summary: Best chip I have ever eaten!
review/text: I live in southwest missouri now and recently visited my daughter and grandson in St. Peters Mo during Christmas 2011.  I was shopping at Schnucks Market and bumped into a center isle display.  I was not shopping for potato chips, but here was this large hill of Spudmaster Colossal Chips right in front of me.  They come in a very colorful paper box, and are contained in a gold foil bag inside the box.  The box has bold American colors of Red, White, and Blue.  There is a cartoon of a large Spud resembling Betty Boop on the front.  I got to tell you, this made me stop and pick up the box for a closer look.  A local company, made right here in Missouri ( America! ).<br /><br />They are alittle pricy at $5 and some change, but what the heck, I thought I would try them.  Low sodium, and seasoned with paprika cant remember what else but it sounded good, and they are fried in peanut oil.  I opened the box in the truck outside in the parking lot to sample them.  They are a very large chip, similar to a kettle chip.  The chips in this bag were darker and not white like ordinary chips, but dont let that fool you.  These chips are simply the best chip I have ever put in my mouth.  The flavor of the chip and not salt, or grease.  Loved them.  I now look forward to going back to St. Peters for another visit with my Grandson, and Schnucks since I cant buy these chips down here yet, and amazon doesnt carry them yet.

review/summary: A great replacement for artificial red food coloring
review/text: I won't need to buy red food coloring for a long time. We use it in hummingbird feeders because they really do like red despite what "experts" say. However, I might believe the experts that we should not be giving the birds nasty chemicals contained in most colorings. If I ever make chocolate cake, I will be sure to use some of this as sugar to get that fancy red color kids like lately.

review/summary: Exact replacement
review/text: I happened upon this product actually at my local costco and thought I'd give it a whirl since I had been wanting to replace the staple refined sugar that was available in the grocery stores where I live. The package indicates that this product can replaced white granulated sugar in all food items. I have tried it with just about everything (as the bag from costco is a hefty 10lbs). From iced tea to cakes, brownies, icings, and breads, I have not had a single problem utilizing this product in lieu of white sugar.<br />Sometimes I get the complaint (from the lovely family members) that the iced tea is less sweet than usual; however, I have not noticed a difference. I use this product in recipes in the exact amount that is called for in white sugar.<br />The only problem I see with buying this product on Amazon is the price. At Costco, I got a 10lb bag for maybe $10-12. And, of course, as they are so wont to do, Costco has removed this product in favor of a different organic white sugar. So I guess I'll be searching for a little bit longer to find my unrefined sugar.

review/summary: An unexpected treasure: Russell's Reserve Rye 6 is a diamond in the rough.
review/text: A moderately inexpensive, relatively young, rye whiskey from a mainstream American mass market distiller... yawn... right?  Wrong.  Prepare to be impressed by the smoothest, creamiest, yet most floral, sweet, and interesting rye you've ever tried.<br /><br />A lovely rich golden amber in the glass.  The nose, after extended air (10-20 minutes) is delicate yet rich with honeysuckle, vanilla, lanolin, mineral and some sweetness with a vegetal components - alfalfa treacle?  It's a light and lovely smell that is soothing and yet appetizing.<br /><br />Entry is off-dry (slightly sweet) with dry cereal and a peppery quality that almost feels like the effervescence of soda.  Midpapalate expansion is sweet with rich cereal sugars, oak vanilla floral essences, some sherry toffee notes, and a big dose of cream.  The creaminess carries into the long and elegant finish with more peppery notes balanced by that sweet floral cream, fading into light wood tannins.<br /><br />Lithe, fruity, floral, sweet and kissed with clean oak; Russels 6 takes rye into a sweeter, lighter, more feminine place than I usually experience rye.  I like it...  Wait, I LOVE it.  A quiet and unassuming knock out.

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: I always have a case or two of Maruchan ramen in the pantry. Their shrimp flavor is especially good. I always drain the soup off the noodles before I serve them. I especially like it with some spinach sauteed with an onion and a head of garlic -- seriously, try it, it's remarkably flavorful and costs next to nothing. Or just the noodles with some chopped green onion to dress them up. Or with a little curry powder. I've tried Top Ramen in the past but prefer Maruchan.

review/summary: Great price, it's ramen
review/text: What can I write about ramen that hasn't been written before now?  It is decently flavored, packed full of sodium, and has a long-ish shelf life.  That is our purpose in purchase - we keep these as our emergency earthquake food.  Maybe not the best choice considering the amount of water it would take to prepare but it is affordable for us at this time.<br /><br />This flavor is not my favorite but the bf maintains that they are "edible" and that he would "eat them again."  Five stars because I don't know how to downgrade a vote for ramen.  It's as steady as the sun.

They sort of taste like those peach ring candies you can get from dollar stores, except these are a lot cleaner and don't have a sour bite to them. My mother didn't like these, but I loved them. Don't let the smooth texture throw you off either.

review/text: Wolfgang Puck Toscana is one of my favorite light roast pod coffees. I have been drinking it for years when available. Amazon is the only place that has it at a decent price and it seems to disappear from time to time. Individually wrapped pods for freshness and they fit nicely in a Senseo pod holder. Not good enough for me to use exclusively, thus only 4 stars, but probably my favorite so far.

review/text: I prefer my coffee strong, and I usually get the chef's reserve made by the same brand.  I wanted to try something different.  I use a Bunn machine, so the option is there to allow for how much water (I choose the least amount) and there is a button to push to make it stronger which I also have to push so that this is not too weak for me.  It has good flavor, but I think in the future I will purchase the chef's reserve which is stronger.  I especially like that the pod covers are biodegradable.  Nice touch, fabulous price.

review/summary: How to Fix Your Pancake Recipe, DO NOT USE WATER!!!
review/text: First off, I just want to mention that I've been to the Griddle Cafe a few times, I've always had a good time. Pancakes are absolutely delicious, as well as a number of other meals on the menu. I bought the red velvet pancake mix in hopes of having a little bit of those good times when I was there at the Griddle. The mix was good BUT there are some minor discrepancies to the directions of how to prepare the batter that I had to alter. It says to use water, but the pancakes will come out horrible; taste is fine... I guess, but the texture is all wrong to what they serve at the Griddle and in general for good pancakes. Instead I looked at the Bisquick mix recipe for pancakes, and the second time around the pancakes came out as they should come out. For 1 cup of R.V. mix, combine 1/2 Cup of milk, 1 egg, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla (if so desired); the pancakes will come out great for a better format of the recipe go to this link: [...]. and go the recipes tab and or search for pancakes, you should get the simple recipe on how to prepare your pancakes... I guarantee it will be so much better

review/summary: I once drove 800 miles for Red Velvet Pancakes
review/text: I have amazing cyber friends in West Hollywood who highly recommended The Griddle Cafe's red velvet pancakes. They tweeted a picture of their brunch and I was sold. The next day I packed up my husband and we took off on our 800-mile round trip to get the pancakes. They were everything they were cracked up to be. We considered seconds... but the nearby La Brea tar pits beckoned and we were full.<br /><br />Now I don't need to drive to get the world's best pancakes, the mix is delivered to my door. I just add water and cream cheese icing (the recipe's on the canister) and these light fluffy pancakes all mine. If you're worried, the very sweet cream cheese icing is perfect for breakfast/brunch since the pancakes themselves are not all that sweet. I purchased the mix for five friends this Christmas. I know they are as happy with their yummy results as I am with mine.<br /><br />By the way, you can order The Griddle Cafe's buttermilk pancake mix right here, too.

Certainly didnt taste much like red velvet. Second batch came out same way. Tried making my famous waffles using this as a base, the taste was redvelvetless.<br /><br />Certainly would not buy again.

review/summary: Wrong Directions?
review/text: I've made red velvet pancakes from scratch before but I bought this to make Sunday morning breakfast prep go a little quicker. The pancakes are good, the recipe for the frosting is good, however - the box says to use 2/3 cups of water with 1 cup of pancake mix. This is NOT correct, I ended up having to use almost half the canister of mix for that 2/3 cups of water. I don't know if this is just a mistake on the can but it was annoying that I've now used half the can on one breakfast for two (when there is supposed to be a lot more servings than that per canister). I'm not sure I would repurchase, this is more convenient than making them from scratch but in the end I don't know if it's worth the price if I only get 4 meals out of it.
