review/summary: Vegan Kids Vitamins
review/text: I didn't know what to expect. Since this was my first time getting these vitamins. I searched high and low for vegan vitamins for my kids. The kids loves them....even my autistic child loves eating them. I do hoped they could make the pills smaller and add more inside the bottle instead of just 60. I will continue to get them....until something better comes along! God Blessed!

review/summary: My vegan toddles loves it!
review/text: We are vegan and so is our baby. When she turned about 14 months, I started giving her this vitamin, cutting it in half, since it's made for children 2 and up. She never had problems chewing it. I think she thinks it's candy...<br />I'm still nursing her and I give her the vitamin every other day or so, as a safety net, since she does eat a pretty good and complete diet.

They even have the same amount of iron as the pediatrician-prescribed "extra-iron" vitamins prescribed for my daughter because she is vegan.

review/summary: Good vitamin for little ones
review/text: I purchased this vitamin for my 2 year old.  This vitamin is a chewable tablet.  Even though it is quite crunchy, my 2 year old loves this vitamin and asks for it every morning.  I didn't taste it myself, and she seems to like it so I will likely continue to purchase it.  My daughter is not a vegan, I am, so my household does eat mainly a vegan diet since I do the cooking!  I do make meat occasionally for my daughter and husband, and the reason I purchased this particular vitamin was that I felt it would round out any nutrients she may not be getting elsewhere and I like that it is all natural.

review/text: My vegetarian 4 year old reported that she felt really strange after she took these vitamins. I honestly think they gave her too much energy because she was very moody on these vitamins. I stopped the vitamins and she felt better again. She usually takes Rainbow Light Kids One Multistars and does not have any issues whatsoever. These vitamins seem like a great option for others out there.

review/summary: Worth the price!
review/text: Every time I've introduced this rice to people they've been amazed that this is brown rice. It's delicious and always used in my home instead of white rice. I prepare it in my rice cooker on the white rice setting as it says on the bag. I add a touch more water than asked to make it a softer texture that I prefer.<br />The rice comes out lighter in color than other brown rice that I've used. At times, I add a little unsalted butter mixed with chopped green onion to dress it up. Never gone back to white rice.<br />I find this rice at my local Asian market.<br />Bottom line is it's a little pricey but soooo worth it!

review/summary: Delicious, easy cooking, short grain brown rice
review/text: I love this rice!  It truly is "tender and delicious" as stated on the package.  Keep in mind that even though it is a product of California, this is a Japanese-style brown rice, thus more polished than American-style brown rice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a few months after posting this review I have had some  bad batches of this rice, regardless of the place of purchase (I tried a nearby Japanese food store as well as a mail-order Korean store).  I also had that experience when buying it already cooked (as part of the bento lunches at a nearby Japanese cafe). It is as if the rice is on its way to being rancid.  If anyone knows what the problem is and how to recognize it before I buy a pack, please let me know because when it is good, it is outstanding.

review/summary: Delish, BUT ...
review/text: I've seen this cereal in Wal-Mart several times but kept passing it up for Kashi's Honey Toasted Oat, a healthier version of Cheerios, but I decide to buy it today based on the great reviews I've read and this cereal is absolutely delicious. I WAS going to buy the pack but it's WAY more cost effective to buy from the grocery store, Wal-Mart in particular. There it's being sold for 2.82 and depending on where I purchase it, county-wise, I only pay 6 or 7 percent tax. So you figure 2.82 * 6 = 16.92 * 7% = 18.10. Sorry Amazon, Wal-Mart though they are terrible in their business practices, they have you beat on this.

review/summary: Great cereal!
review/text: If you're looking for a healthy and "heart smart" cereal, this could be it.  As a cold cereal, the flakes are tasty and crunchy.  The blueberry/kash clusters are also nice, adding texture and flavor, although I find that they float to the bottom of my bowl midway through.  I usually eat this with just milk for breakfast or to fuel a midday jog, but I've also been known to eat it right out of the box when I'm hungry and need something healthy to eat ASAP!<br /><br />The taste is slightly sweet without going overboard and could use a few more blueberries per serving, but I add my own.  This cereal is not, unfortunately, organic, as other items in the Kashi line are.  But it's still a great selection for a quick meal any time of the day!<br /><br />As for best prices on this product, I do NOT support Wal-Mart regardless of how low their prices are.  Whole Foods tends to be the most expensive, of course, and I've seen this elsewhere for about $3.49 per box.  Because it's Kashi, it won't be cheap but it's a good addition to your diet if you can afford it.

review/text: I started buying Kashi Blueberry Cluster cereal about 3 years ago, at that time there were blueberries..however, the last few boxes I've purchased are only tiny cluster, and NOT blueberries. The reason I started buying the cereal in the first place was because of less sugar and oat flakes. I won't purchase another box of Kashi cereal, instead I am going for Natures Path cereal which HAS REAL BLUEBERRIES.

review/text: Amazon sends me a lot of requests to review products that I have purchased and I mostly ignore the requests. This time, I realized that I really liked this cereal because it remains super crunchy in milk and it is delicious, so I would review it. I ordered 6 boxes of the cereal and I would order it again. I haven't seen it in the grocery store. I like the add-ins that are in the box--the clusters and the blueberries, but fundamentally, it's the flakes that I really like because of their texture and the fact that they stand up to milk until the bottom of the bowl. Yes, it has fiber and nutrients that you want in your cereal, but it's the taste that will see you reaching for this box from your shelf. I have about 5 different cereals in the pantry. This is the one I always select. I eat cereal for dinner a lot--this one is substantial enough to feel like a meal.

I was instantly impressed with its taste, and I've come to enjoy it each morning as if I were having it again for the first time. It is truly delicious. The perfect cereal: crunchy, not too sweet, deeply satisfying, and nutritionally balanced. I certainly hope that Kashi never stops making it. It would be a very sad day, indeed. My personal congrats to whomever at the company came up with Blueberry Flake and Cluster Oat Cereal--he/she should go down in history of cereal alongside the names of Kellogg and Post.

review/text: Kashi makes some of the most healthful cereals on the market, and this oat flakes and blueberry clusters cereal is no exception.  There is a lot to like in this cereal box.  First, they taste great.  The touch of blueberries (a healthy fruit with many antioxidants) and oats (cholesterol lowering) gives a hearty taste without being too sweet. The flakes are crunchy, and stay crunchy (for a time) even in milk. Second, the ingredients are all healthy: total fat 2 grams, No cholesterol, 135 mg sodium, and 4 grams of dietary fiber.  Loaded with vitamins, there is 25% Vitamin A, 50% Vitamin C, 100% Vitamin E, 100% Vitamin B6, 100% Folic Acid, 100% Vitamin B12.<br /><br />Total calories per 1 cup serving total 200 (15 calories from fat).<br /><br />Put real blueberries on this cereal for additional taste and nutrition!<br /><br />This one will be on my shelf.<br /><br />kone

review/summary: wow--one of the best cereals I've ever had
review/text: If that sounds effusive, let me tell you--it's the truth. I ordered this cereal during the Kashi promotion Amazon had because I already liked two other Kashi cereals (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGXT2A">Kashi Organic Promise Cinnamon Harvest Cereal, 17.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and Kashi Good Friends Cinna-Raisin Crunch Cereal, 14-Ounce Box (Pack of 6)).<br /><br />This one is perfect. Simply perfect. It's not overly sweet, the blueberries aren't wimpy, and the texture of the flakes is wonderfully crisp and hearty.<br /><br />I am sharing this with my mom and dad, who need a cereal with lots of fiber and good taste, and they love it, too. Considering how picky my dad is, that's quite a testimonial.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: It's Magically Delicious!
review/text: and you don't need a dancing Leprechaun and a wheel barrow of sugar to convince you of it.  In addition to great taste, it's got a great texture, doesn't get all soggy when you put milk on it.  With the $20 off $49 special going on Amazon during July 08, it's a good deal to buy from Amazon too.  Stock up while it is on special cause chances are it will stock out soon with the current special offer.  It is easily one of my favorite cereals along with a few other Kashi products.  You'll look forward to getting up in the morning when you know you'll have a bowl of this waiting!

review/text: Kashi cereals taste awesome and are really healthy for you (supposedly). The price of a box is rediculous though. I can get a box of raising bran for about $2 a box for 16oz. Kashi is about $4 in stores and you get 11oz.<br /><br />Bit of a rip off but hey... All Organic ingredients.<br /><br />I'm mixed on the value of this...

review/summary: Incredibly misleading
review/text: This cereal is very misleading: the box claims to have blueberry clusters (photo shows abundant clusters) but contains at most two or three clusters PER BOWL, maybe 15 clusters PER BOX. As someone who rarely reviews anything, the extreme lack of blueberries and apparent false advertising was so laughable that I felt the need to find reviews on the Internet to see how others received it. I find it very surprising that there are so many positive reviews... Is the lack of blueberries a new thing? Perhaps the economic meltdown has led to Kashi grossly cutting back on including dried fruit in their products? I think the answer is yes. That, or maybe we should just all stop making the silly assumption that a cereal that claims to have "oat flakes & blueberry clusters" actually has blueberry clusters.

review/summary: Stays crunchy but uh..
review/text: I dislike how all the flake cereals immediately dissolve into the milk forcing you to eat as fast as possible.. so this one was a good surprise. It's quite crunchy and stays that way in milk, but maybe a little over crunchy?.. They really did not need to glaze it that much. With that much glaze I also expected it to have a lot of flavor but no.. it was like just crunch crunch all the time. Also, where are the clusters?? I see tiny flakes of blue colors oats (like a cluster of 2 oats max) randomly, but no blueberries!! I don't see where you all are seeing these yummy blueberries. Please tell me how my cereal is missing all the clusters. If it's supposed to be that way, why does the picture so clusters so large and claim to have clusters?!?

review/text: I learned a valuable lesson, buy one at your local store before you buy a case from Amazon! I like most (NOT all) of Kashi products, so this cereal sounded great. I'm big on crunchy, but this flake is over the top! It's not only crunchy, it has minute pieces of something (grain?) in each flake that was too hard for a cereal. The taste was fine, it was just too hard to chew, and I don't like to let it soak to soften, then it's mush. The fruit in it was delish, tho!

review/summary: Too sweet and "blueberryie" for me! Not for this Kashi fan...
review/text: To be sure, Kashi Heart to Heart Blueberry Flake and Cluster cereal has a great nutritious quality and crunch. Bluberry and cereal clusters give a nice textural change to the crisp, sweet flakes that make up the bulk of this cereal. Unfortunately for me though, I found the blueberry flavor overwhelming and cloyingly sweet. I even tried to finish the box eating it dry as a snack but couldn't do it. Honestly, I tossed away almost a half box of this stuff (I kept eating it because I paid so much for it!) and was hugely disappointed in this purchase. Blueberry flavored cereal fans will love this stuff! For me, I'll stick to my favorite Kashi cereal <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E060">Kashi Heart To Heart Honey Toasted Oat Cereal, 12.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>which is only slightly sweet and packs a great crunch!

review/summary: Okay - not great
review/text: First, understand I am a complete coffee fanatic...I even have several coffee plants growing in my home. I love a good cup of Jamaican Blue Mountain - I've actually visited the island and many of the plantations - and I'm willing to pay the high price for the best beans in the world. While these are okay, they aren't exactly the cream of the crop.<br /><br />Still, I want to start by complimenting the shipper. They arrived quickly, and if I'm to believe the "Roasted On" date on the package, they were roasted the day before I received them. The packaging was also top notch and my beans arrived in great condition.<br /><br />But that's about the end of the positives. For one thing, I always expect JBM to be somewhat large beans, uniformly dark and with a slightly glossy or oily appearance. The best tend to look almost "pampered". These beans weren't that...they looked like the small leftovers at the bottom of the barrel. The color was rather pale for JBM, and many of the individual beans were cracked and broken. I have to say, the beans just seemed unappealing in terms of appearance, and I've never seen that before from anything claiming to be pure JBM coffee.<br /><br />As for the taste, I'd rate it fair to good overall, but only fair compared to better brands of Jamaican Blue Mountain. The taste was very mild and again, somewhat stale tasting, and with an unusual almost fruity taste I haven't experienced before from JBM coffees. Perhaps this vendor doesn't sell much JBM, and so the remnants sit in their facility for many months longer than optimum, or possibly there were other varieties accidentally mixed in.<br /><br />To be clear, I wouldn't say they were terrible beans - certainly better than the JBM "blends" you see advertised, or anything you'll find at the local Starbucks. They're just not up to the standards I expect for a really fine Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, especially considering they aren't exactly a bargain price.

review/text: I wish I could give a better review. On the positive, the delivery of the coffee was SUPER FAST and friendly, and the re-sealable package was top notch. However, the coffee did not live up to our expectations. We understand that JBM often has a "mild" flavor, but when we brewed it at a regular setting, it was very thin. We had to grind almost twice as many beans as normal to get a good taste; this used up our beans really fast.

review/text: I can't eat any kind of wheat flour, but since I discovered Almond Meal (Bob's Red Mill), my diet is much easier to live with. I use 4 parts almond meal with 4 parts garbanzo (bean) flour and 1 part potato starch (NOT potato flour)as a substitute for regular flour. I've made brownies, peanut butter cookies, banana bread, and carrot cookies and found the texture and taste are not noticeably different than the original recipe, at least to me.

review/summary: Gluten Free and SCD, yes, but NOT My Top Pick
review/text: While these arrived fresh, freshness isn't the only hallmark of a quality product.  You can get the same results with a good food processor (i.e. a Kitchen Aid). This is NOT a fine, even grind.  If I sift the product, I find a lot of chunks.  I want a fine EVEN grind when using nut meal/flour (the terms are used interchangeably in the industry) as the main or only flour in my baked goods.<br /><br />Since this brand is easy to find in many supermarkets, I do recommend it for some uses.  It's good for folks who don't do mail order, those non-GF cooks looking to lower the carb count of their bread coatings, and those looking for an easy GF or a no-carb "breading" option, but only when a coarse coating is suitable. For instance I like fine coatings if I'm going to "pan fry" a white/light flesh fish fillet.<br /><br />When used as the main or only flour for baking, the batter will look lumpy and the finished product will taste a bit gritty. It won't perform well in some recipes because the chunkier nature of the grind will affect the way the batter handles moisture, which could result in a dense rather than light texture.  It could also yield products that fall severely upon cooling.<br /><br />In order words, disappointing outcomes might not be the recipe or your culinary technique, it could be your choice in ingredients!

While trying to locate a source for unsweetened coconut, I was led to Amazon.com where a sale on Bob's Red Mill Almond Flour happened to be occuring.  I had been used to paying much more for a much smaller bag of almond flour through the health food section of my grocery store.  I was so pleased to find a source of the flour at almost half price plus a special of free shipping.  There were 4-16 oz packages to a box shipped in a reasonable amount of time in the original carton that is purchased for display by grocery stores so I know it was fresh.  I let everyone I know about the great prices on low carb supplies available at Amazon.

review/summary: Great for the GAPS diet.
review/text: I've started using this almond flour to make GAPS-friendly recipes, since grains are prohibited on the GAPS diet.<br /><br />I tried to use it to make cookie dough, and it didn't go so well because it completely changed the flavor and texture.  Also, I think this flour makes the resulting food heavier...which makes sense, anyway.  The gritty texture makes cookie dough less appealing to me.<br /><br />In other recipes, though, this works totally fine.  For instance, I made banana bread with this almond flour and it is still kind of heavy, but it tastes great.  I haven't tried it yet, but I suspect this flour would substitute especially well in crusts, instead of a graham cracker crust.<br /><br />Overall, this almond flour is not wheat flour--it tastes different, the texture is different, and it behaves a little different in recipes...so if you're just coming away from wheat flour, it isn't the same.  However, it is a decent substitute in many recipes, and I plan to continue using it.

review/summary: Incredible addition to baking!
review/text: Replacing half the flour in a basic muffin mix with these finely ground almonds is a great way to add flavor and nutrition while reducing startchy carbs. My signature muffin uses these almonds, a splash of almond extract, real white chocolate and raspberries. For a low carb version, I use poppyseed and these almonds replacing half the flour while sweetening the recipe with Splenda. Bob's Red Mill Almond Meal/Flour is also an incredible addition to Belgian waffles. The flavor marries well with pure maple syrup harvested near our inn, the Anton-Walsh House Bed & Breakfast Inn of Hurley, Wisconsin (just two blocks from the boarder with Ironwood, Michigan).<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDG598">Bob's Red Mill Almond Meal/Flour, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Texture?
review/text: Am I using the same flour as everyone else? This stuff was a pain. The texture wasn't flourlike at all, it had huge clumps and the almond flour cookies I made (with an almond flour recipe) were HORRIBLE - grainy to the point that they would not even stay in a cookie shape, no matter how careful I was. Investigated after this and apparently Bob's Red Mill is known for this. I haven't really had issues with their other flours I've used (I'm on a gluten free diet like many people writing reviews for BRM products) so I think maybe they just don't grind the almonds fine enough? Not sure what exactly the issue is, but it is honestly unusable in recipes relying on lots of almond flour. Now I have 3 bags of it left and just mix a little in with other GF things I'm baking for a bit of added nutrition. If there's not too much in the flour mix, it doesn't affect the texture badly enough to ruin it, but you can still feel it a little. Blech. Who wants to buy a flour you have to grind fine yourself? I don't own a food processor, so it's not even an option for me. Might as well just make it myself at this price.

review/summary: If You Haven't Tried Almond Meal in Your Baked Goods . . .
review/text: . . . you are missing out on a true baker's secret--magically moister, richer baked goodies. Plus, you'll be adding protein. Almond meal works great in bread machine breads. I use 1/2 cup as a substitute for the same amount of wheat flour.<br /><br />The downside is this stuff is pricey. NOW Vitamins has it for less, though Bob's is gourmet and elegant in the simplicity with which he crafts his foods. Trader Joe's used to carry almond meal but hasn't lately, at least at our local store.<br /><br />Wherever you purchase it, do give almond meal/flour a try. I think it's a bakers blessing and good for all.

review/summary: Great for Low-Carb Cheesecake Crust!
review/text: I purchased the almond flour with the intentions of making low carb pancakes, brownies and muffins. I also discovered it to be a great cheesecake crust alternative for those who are on a low carb diet. You mix the almond flour with your favorite sugar substitude (Splenda, Stevia or Truvia etc..), Ground cinnamon and butter (optional for flavor and moldable crust) and you have a very tasty graham cracker type of crust. I used about 1/2 cup of Almond flour which is equivalent to 8g Carbs 10g protien for the whole cheesecake pie crust. The price for the almond flour is not Cheap (about $10 per lb) when  compared  to other so-called low carb flour options such as those that are made out of flaxseed, coconut and wheat. I studied my options before buying and found the almond flour to be the one with the least carbs per serving.

review/summary: DELISH
review/text: I use this for making marzipan (almond paste) which is so expensive to buy ready made. It is very easy to make. Instead of powdered sugar I use Xylitol which is a natural sweetener that tastes like sugar, but is a lot better for you, expecially if you're diabetic. You can buy it in powdered form under 'Jarrow Formulas Xyli-Pure Xylitol Powder, 16 oz', or a 5 lb bag of non powdered Xylitol (it comes in smaller amounts too).<br /><br />I recently found out on the Internet that if you have a Vita Mix blender (which I have), you can make your own powdered sugar from Xylitol to make marzipan. I've done it twice and it tasted exactly the same as marzipan made with ordinary powdered sugar. It is more expensive, but worth it if you are thinking about your health and weight!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ORSIJ4">Xlear Xylosweet Bag, 5-Pound</a><br /><br />The price of this Almond Meal/Flour is very good, I saw it in my local Richard's Whole Food Store for almost $11 a packet, that's without tax. If you subscribe, they send you 4 pks for $30.60, no tax and free shipping and have it delivered whenever you like by managing your subscriptions, or even cancel it if you wish. I've found that it keeps a very long time. You can use it for lots of recipes, like cakes and pastry, it's delicious and a bargain.

review/summary: Not 100% safe for SCD/GAPS!
review/text: BRM 'gluten free' items still contain some sort of gluten cross contamination.  We started SCD/GAPS to deal with lingering health problems caused by eating a regular GF diet for our Celiacs.  I bought 2 different brands of almond flour, one made specifically for and by SCD and BRM.  We used up the other brand and started using the BRM and guess what?  ALL symptoms of Celiac started coming back!!  Doing an Internet search I did find out that many Celiac's not only react badly to BRM almond flour, but to many other of BRM GF items too.  Before SCD, we had stopped using any BRM GF baking products because we always got 'gluten sick ' from them.  We will NEVER use another  GF flour from BRM again because their food safety is just not strict enough.  I did get a prompt refund from BRM for the $125 I spent on the 25lb box of almond flour though.

There is also a place on the site to see if someone carries it in your area.  I was just a few clicks away from purchasing this here, and decided to do a quick check on the website which is where I will buy it until the price is equal here.  Just to be clear, if it was just the soda I would give it 5-stars, but because the price is essentially doubled, I am driving the point home that the pricing is outrageous and hopefully giving it 1-star will get people to read this.

review/summary: Pretty Good; Hot Stuff...
review/text: I like hot things and usually when items boast being hot, they're usually somewhere in the medium range. I have to say that this one is pretty hot for not being a specialty product meant to raise eyebrows. Flavor is pretty good; the meat in this brand (general Western's meat flavor not flavor type) is on the tangy side and texture more soft compared to Tillamook and other more traditional beef sticks, but it doesn't seem greasy. The sticks are also smaller which is OK with me. The casing may be "natural", but I'd say manufactured and not intestine which I tend to prefer.<br /><br />Overall, not my favorite stick or flavor, but the quality is good, price is fair, they warn that cajun is their "spiciest", and everyone has differing tastes; that's not their fault, so I they still get 5 from me. By the way, I followed with a purchase of the peppered bacon which I like better.

I imagine it would be a little more palatable to add sugar to it, but I'm not a fan of sweetening teas and prefer to drink them straight. It had some laxative effects by morning, but nothing too overpowering. This is definitely a very mild tea.

Still not as good as the original, but it helps cut the craving down :)  Good cost cutter, option, too, as long as you buy them either direct from the Tassimo company online, or from a place like BB&B (bed, bath...). The price here, if for only 1 package is ridiculous. Twentyfive? Ten is more of the standard pricing.  I believe BBB offers free ship online for single serve coffees like this, too.  Tassimo often does sales and always does free ship over 50 buckaroos.  If you sign up for emails from Tassimo, they often send out deals and sales on their stuff, too.<br /><br />There were a couple of cons, though. One is that they only offer the Peppermint Mocha seasonally, so that may be part of the high cost here on amazon right now.  The second downside is that there was a bit of a chemically aftertaste.  Nothing horrible, but definitely noticeable.

review/summary: Tassimo disappoints again... :(
review/text: Five stars for Amazon; fast delivery, great packing, etc.  Standard Amazon service...<br /><br />The product itself... well, I really wanted to like this.  I really did.  But it's the same bitter coffee that the Tassimo came out with two years ago.  I had put my machine up in the closet for two years, hoping that maybe the coffees would taste better when I pulled it back down.  Nope.  The syrup is good, but the coffee itself is extremely bitter and it tastes burned -- even more burned than the 'green mermaid' coffee.  My machine goes back up on the closet shelf for another year... the concept is awesome, the machine is neat, but when the drinks taste like burned coffee beans, I just won't use it.<br /><br />I'm not giving up on you yet, Tassimo... but the K-Cups at work sure do taste a lot better than the stuff coming out of the Tassimo...

review/summary: Not Too Festive
review/text: I was really excited for Tassimo to get a mocha line of coffees.  I love chocolate mixed with peppermint and had really high hopes for this blend.  It tasted like Gas-X mixed with coffee, and just like Gas-X it stayed with you the rest of the day . . . Not too festive for a holiday coffee.  I must say the regular mocha is delightful!  Note:  This is WAY cheaper on Tassimo.com, thus I don't feel so guilty throwing it out.

review/summary: Okay, not great
review/text: This is the third flavor that I've tried out in my Tassimo and I had high hopes for it since I REALLY enjoyed the regular Gevalia Mocha.  I was expecting more of an "Andes Candy" flavor, but unfortunately, the peppermint flavor here is a little too over the top/bitey and the chocolate is somewhat toned down/non-existent.  I might do some more experimenting with this though, since I have 7 more servings left.  I'll probably try something along the lines of brewing a Suchard Hot Chocolate disc in conjunction with the Peppermint Chocolate and espresso discs that comprise this flavor, in hopes that might take some of the edge off of the excessive peppermint.<br /><br />I am glad that Kraft is putting out seasonal flavors and want to support that endeavor, but I probably wouldn't buy this one again.  If you do like peppermint, you might want to give this a shot.

review/summary: Tastes Like Coffee Medicine!
review/text: This is the worst tasting stuff I've ever experienced in a T-Disc.  It literally tastes like coffee flavored medicine.  It even leaves a bad medicine like  aftertaste in your mouth.  Very disappointed.  Won't ever buy again nor can I recommend it.
