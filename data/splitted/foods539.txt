review/summary: unbeLIEVably GREAT pasta -- YEAH!!!
review/text: This healthier, multigrain pasta has totally transformed my usually whole-wheat-hating husband.  He adores it, preferring it now over his old white pasta, which he'll no longer buy as a substitute even if this isn't available.<br /><br />All the shapes of Barilla Plus are great (I especially love the rotini and the thin spaghetti), but these lovely bow ties (farfalle) please my hubby the best.  When he cooks, he'll make a fabulous pasta salad with them, or he'll serve them hot with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3OA7G">Scarpetta Tuscan Vodka Sauce, 19.8-Ounce Jar (Pack of 4)</a>(an out-of-this-world, shelf-stable gourmet sauce which heats in its own jar in the microwave -- no pots!).  For an even more festive dish, try adding sliced stuffed green olives to the vodka sauce and topping with freshly shaved parmesan.  Good dinner-party dish!<br /><br />We probably eat Barilla Plus pasta at least once a week and have successfully foisted it onto non-healthfood-eating guests who had no idea they were being served anything but an unusually delicious ordinary pasta.  Try this for yourself and your old-style-pasta-loving family and friends, and I'll bet you'll be hooked, too.  On Subscribe-and-Save, even -- YEAH, Amazon!!!  A huge win for us.  :)

review/summary: Great tea at a great price
review/text: This is an unexpectedly enjoyable tea.  The mate gives it a deeper and woodier taste than black tea alone, with just a hint of smokiness.  While that might not sound particularly appetizing, it's actually quite good.  However, I ONLY like it with a squirt of lemon juice (and sweetener).  Without lemon juice, I don't enjoy it, but I have to have lemon juice in my plain tea, as well.<br /><br />The flavor is distinctive enough that when I moved to a small town where the local store doesn't carry Morning Thunder, I didn't switch back to plain tea.  I had to start getting multiple boxes on my periodic trips to the big city.  I was delighted to find that Amazon now offers it at a price lower than most supermarkets.  Having it delivered (for free with Prime membership or Super Saver) is the ultimate in convenience.<br /><br />I don't find this tea particularly invigorating (not that I notice, anyway, which is perhaps a good thing), but the mate does seem to live up to its reputation as an appetite suppressant.  Whether it revs you up or not, it's a great way to get started in the morning.  And with the astonishingly high level of antioxidants (due both to the tea and the mate), you can actually feel good about drinking it.<br /><br />Don't be alarmed by the six-pack size.  It's a good enough tea that you'll go through it quickly.  Each box is individually wrapped in plastic (as you'd get it at the store), so you can expect a long shelf life.

review/summary: Start your morning with a roar
review/text: Move over coffee, I'll take some Morning Thunder.  When my doctor told me I had to seriously limit my coffee, (from 3-4 cups a day to 1 or 2 cups per week) I despaired.  How could I have the energy I craved to jumpstart my day without coffee?  I tried various teas and coffee substitutes with limited success.  When I found mate, I knew I was half-way there because I liked the energy, but I longed for stronger taste.  Hence, when I found Morning Thunder, with half mate and half black tea, I rejoiced.  A steaming cup of this, graced with soy milk, is truly a gift from God.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Smoldering and tantalizing brew
review/text: Morning Thunder is an excellent name for this drink, but I have a feeling it might put some people off, as the tea is very good without being too whacky and crazy tasting. I was expecting a real potent punch, but upon reading that it had yerba mate in it, which I  drank in one of my favorite Chai mixes, I was sure it would be palate pleasing and I was right! This tea is very simple, as the ingredients list is short; roasted mate and black tea- no fillers, no funny stuff and no funky herbs and spices.  Upon further search on the internet of it I found out that Yerba Mate is an herb that is traditionally prepared as an energizing tea and consumed by natives of South American countries as it contains high concentrations of antioxidant flavonoids possessing potent free radical quenching activity.  It also includes several B vitamins, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Beta-Carotene and Calcium. Mixed with black tea, the Mate tastes like dark chocolate, just a hint mixed with the tea, it's a subtle yet an eye opening experience upon the first sip.<br /><br />I try to take good care of my health and drink lots of tea and water, but I had no idea how high in antioxidants this tea was! Per serving it had 1150mg, compared to 375 to 800 in broccoli, 600 to 900 in Tomato Juice and 650 to 1100 in Orange Juice. Tea is much easier to prepare than eating a bowl full of broccoli and drinking tomato juice, and it's quite refreshing and also tasted nice with some milk and sugar. I don't add lemon to it, just sugar and I let it soak in for about 3 minutes. Its makes a slightly smoky, chocolaty and exotic brew, yet it's still tea can be drank at breakfast or tea time. I love the cover art and the simple goodness of Celestial Seasonings, as it reaches out and transforms many coffee addicts to tea lovers &#61514;<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/summary: Know all the facts
review/text: Personally, I very much enjoyed the flavor and the tea gave me a very pleasant lift. The feeling was similar to a regular caffeine lift from coffee, but it also created a feeling of mental alertness rather than jittery.<br /><br />BUT ---  there is some evidence that consuming too much of this in certain ways can cause health problems.<br /><br />I'm not trying to be a "downer" or rain on anyone's parade -- enjoy it if you choose. I do believe, however, that there is nothing wrong with informing people and then letting them make their choices. The studies done seem to be legitimate. The odds are against any one of you readers being harmed by yerba mate, but out of thousands of drinkers, there will likely be some who are. So this is just in the spirit of helping you make an informed decision, especially if you smoke.  And I wasn't biased against it -- I REALLY did enjoy it.........<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />You can look up other studies if you choose, and disregard the ones that you believe are not convincing. But it is important to make an informed choice.

review/summary: A change of pace to a coffee lover
review/text: Although it may not give you the acidic bite of a strong cup of coffee , it does have a distinctive flavor all it's own and it does have that caffeine kick that kind of creeps up on you rather than hit you right away..it is very pleasing to the palate if you're a regular tea drinker. I take a few bags with me to work for a quick caffeine fix in the middle of the afternoon that way I have a fresh cup and dont have to brew an entire pot of coffee for just a cup or two. Works great for me..and obviously I like it since I purchased a whole case of it.

review/summary: Bison at Breakfast
review/text: Celestial Seasonings began with herbal teas- chamomile, green tea, orange pekoe, and now has branched out into more exotic blends like yerba mate, chai, and rooibos. Morning Thunder, with its surrealistic depiction of bison, is a perfect depiction of this powerful tea. Yerba mate is a stimulant from South America, mainly consumed in Argentina. Celestial Seasonings roasts it, giving it a somewhat burnt flavor. It's more like a revved-up black tea than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028QDMY">Yerba Mate' Tea -Organic - 25 - Bag</a>, which aims for a more authentic taste. Morning Thunder has the earthy flavor, but Sebastopol's Guayaki goes for the authenticity. Celestial Seasonings offers a savory, spicy introduction for the newbie. It's a delicious wake-up call in a cup!

review/summary: Works as well as coffee without the jitters
review/text: I found that coffee makes me jittery and it also upsets my stomach a bit, so I needed a strong replacement.  Morning Thunder definitely fits the bill for me.  There's enough caffeine in it to really wake me up and since it's a tea, you don't really get nasty coffee mouth after you drink it.  For me, there aren't any side effects other than being more awake.<br /><br />The flavor is very herby and grassy.  It reminds me a little of the Asian grass jelly drink.  It's not something that I would order at a restaurant, but the flavor is passable for me so I don't mind drinking it.<br /><br />The leaves come in fancy pouches that don't have a string attached.  I've found that I can either let it sit for a while to get stronger or I can stir it to speed up the process.  I don't know if tea aficionados would object to stirring it, but I suspect that tea aficionados would be buying loose leaf tea anyways.<br /><br />Overall, I find it to be a great replacement for coffee or any other caffeinated drink.  It definitely wakes me up and I don't get any of the side effects of drinking coffee like bad breath, the jitters or an upset stomach.

review/text: Morning Thunder Tea is the kind of tea with a kick. I do not know about anyone else but to me strong tea makes me feel pretty darn good, almost like I am getting away with something (funny, since its perfectly legal..) and perks me up on my branch and all of a sudden I want to do things and stop dozing off. I want to create, to ponder on issues otherwise reserved for the acute minded, I want to get so high from that tea that I might start laughing for no valid reason, make a fool of myself. Can anyone tell I am on it right now? I am as happy as a clam. Once I drink it early in the morning and I am a little moody for thinking I did not sleep well and I am Bitchy and un-accessible to the world the Morning Thunder takes care of setting my course straight. I am sure there are many strong teas and by God, I would like to meet them all, but Morning Thunder is under my roof so it gets 4 Stars for being there, help to accentuate the self for the productive side of things. Long Live America!

It brews to the color of a medium or medium - dark roast (closer to medium).  It is bright without being overly acidic (it retains a smoothness, but not so smooth as to be mellow; it is still bright).  It is rich and good mouth feel.  It retains it's flavor for the whole pot without changing (I'm assuming it would if you left it in glass carafe on hot plate).<br />I brought a thermal carafe to work right after brewing and honestly, it could have been a coffee commercial:<br />Eyes opening widely, "Omg, this is really good coffee."<br />Big grin, "This is delicious!  This is the best coffee I've ever had!  I love you, and I mean it this time!"<br />Satisfied smile, "This is really good coffee, delightful.  It tastes like coffee from when I grew up (in Central America)."<br />When I first brewed and tasted it I thought to myself, this may be the only coffee I ever buy again.<br />Usually I purchase:  Starbucks, Gevalia, and Illy.<br />The price really is pretty good for 12 oz bags of ORGANIC coffee!

review/text: These are one of the best sour candy treats ever, if not the best.  They have the best consistency because they're just the right amount of chewy.  They don't break apart between your teeth like other nonsensical jelly beans and the like; they're just amazing.<br /><br />If you like sour, and the perfect challenge for your teeth, buy these bites, they're delicious.

Very easy to manipulate and has a very consistent result. Very enjoyable for everyone because its not overly bitter or sweet with a very rich finish.

review/summary: Chewy and tasty
review/text: I bought the variety pack since they are pricey and I didn't want to commit to one flavor in case they weren't all that good.  I liked them all.  The peanut butter chocolate chip was the most "desserty" flavor of the bunch with a few chocolate chips in the bar.  The Cherries and Berries had some nice dried fruit chunks in it and a nutty sesame taste.  The Granola with Coconut tasted exactly as the name implies.  I will likely purchase the variety pack again instead of the single flavor boxes.  They do not have a lot of protein and are somewhat high in fat, are very moist and chewy, so they aren't what I am used to from my meal replacement bars (I really like Zone Perfect Fudge Graham bars - my kids also like them which is a bonus and a decent after school/before sports snack that transports easily in backpacks and sports bags).  Nice for a change but not quite as filling as others I have tried.

review/text: I am a vegan breastfeeding mom.  My little one was diagnosed with a soy protein sensitivity, so I had to eliminate soy from my diet. Soy-free vegan protein is hard to find, particularly in a convenience food.  I was reluctant to order 15 of any one flavor, in case I didn't care for it, so this variety was a nice option.  All the flavors are good,the peanut chocolate chip one is the only one particularly high in protein, with 15 grams.  Cherries and berries is particularly delicious, good enough for desert!

While this isn't necessarily unhealthy, this kind of main ingredient isn't really 'big picture food.'

review/summary: Absolutely Love It ! !
review/text: When I was a kid I used to get a brand of beef jerky that doesn't exist anymore and I absolutely loved it to death (well, not really to death, but...).  I have tried so many different brands of jerky and have not really found a good substitute to that old brand until a month or so ago I found THIS brand in a small grocery store in the middle of nowhere U.S.A. and bought it on a whim.  I couldn't contain myself because I had FINALLY found a substitute to that old brand, and I just had to get more of it and fast.  So I came online to find it and Amazon.com had it so I ordered a WHOLE case.  It got here in great time and was packaged very well.  I now have a standing order to receive this product every so often and am loving snack time again.<br /><br />This is not the kind of Jerky that makes you feel like you just ripped a hunk of meat off a dead cow, it's been ground up and processed and then made into strips, but that's the kind I LOVE.  Thank you Amazon, and thank you Lowery's!<br /><br />Signed by a VERY satisfied customer.

review/summary: Occasionally moldy but otherwise good
review/text: We used to buy the canisters of these until they disappeared from retail stores.  They were addicting but later became hit-and-miss.  Some was tender and fresh, while some was too stale or smoky-tasting and would get left unfinished.  The expiration dates were at least 6 months ahead, so that wasn't the problem.<br /><br />Anyway, we recently ordered the bags and were pleasantly surprised.  They're not quite as tender and tasty as the first canisters we opened years ago, but they're worth the price.  The only problem we've had is that out of 6 shipments and 72 bags, 4 bags contained mold -- from 3 different shipments.  Three bags had just a couple spots of mold but were a little stale and tasted funny.  The fourth bag had about half the surface area of the jerky covered in white mold, and the smell was pretty bad.  We're still eating more but checking for mold first -- not something we should have to do.<br /><br />As someone else mentioned, the Amazon's product photo and nutrition information are old.  The bag now advertises 16 grams of protein, not 21.  Fat content is increased from 10 g to 14.

review/summary: High fat jerky
review/text: I got a bag of jerky at the drug store a few weeks ago because it was on sale and I wanted a low-fat, low-carb, high-protein snack.  It was pretty good but a bit expensive so I decided to get some at amazon.com with a subscribe and save deal.<br /><br />Sad to say, I shopped based on price because I thought jerky was jerky.  That was a mistake.<br /><br />This Lawry's jerky is tender and easy to chew but the fat content is almost as high as the protein content.  This is low-budget, low-quality jerky.  My kids like it but I would prefer to pay a little extra and get them healthier stuff.<br /><br />I canceled the subscribe and save.  I will look for something different.

I've been addicted to these since my high school days in the mid 80's when they used to make them so dry that they about broke your jawbone. So much better these days with the same taste but not so dried out like dog treats. But, they seem to be really hard to find until I found them months ago at our local grocery store but others must have liked them as much as we do that they instantly sold out. They restocked them and days later they were gone once again. Argh! So I went onto their website where they directed me to Amazon where I ended up buying 2 sets (16) canisters so we'll have some for months to come. I just hope Amazon continues to carry these since we can't find these anywhere anymore. Thank Heaven for Amazon! : )

review/summary: Jerky-esque.....
review/text: I can only call this stuff "jerky-esque," because it is really not like any "real" jerky that I've ever had before. Easy to bite through and chew, but extremely processed and pressed into form. As alluded to in another review, the look and texture of the these is very reminiscent of jerky-treats that are made for dogs. Overall, I'd give the texture 2.5-3 stars....different...a bit odd...ok, but not really "meaty."<br /><br />Taste, I'd give 2 stars. They rate as edible, but certainly not good. Eating a full serving at one time tends to feel like a chore, so that should tell you right there that these things aren't too great. Not horrible, but not something I'd prefer to eat...<br /><br />Value. Decent, but in a subjective sense. You get a lot of product for the price....which is great if you happen to like them....but nothing to crow about if you don't....

review/summary: Veg Dog Food
review/text: My dogs are now veg dogs. I'm a vegan & all of my family is, so for a very very personal reason I wanted the dogs to eat veg too. I was tired & grossed out when feeding them & having them lick any of us, so now I feel better. I know they are getting the nutrition they need & they can be veg along with us. They adore the food too & don't seem to be missing meat, if they were I would let them have some, but I would buy some organic, better farmed stuff to feed them in that case, not dog food in a can. Meat in a can has so much junk in it, it's not really meat anymore or healthy.

review/text: Have tried a variety of vegetarian and vegan dog foods over the years.  My senior dog is doing well with, and likes, Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula canned dog food.  I'm glad to have it.  He is 15 1/2 years old, and along with supplements to help for aging issues, this is his only dog food.  It is gentle on his stomach, and is wheat and soy free, although it is not organic.

review/summary: Dog Loves It
review/text: Our family is vegetarian and so is our dog. My dog is very elderly and loves this food. In fact, he loves it so much that he pretty much pushes me out of the bowl while I'm trying to scoop it out. I guess he figures he's too old to be bothered with manners. Anyway, I now prepare it (I mix it with his dry food) on the counter so we don't have any more "encounters".

review/text: Many green teas leave you feeling like you're just drinking a cup of hot water.  This tea has taste.  The added white tea really adds a delicious note to the cup.  As these bags are stringless/tagless, they work well in my ekobrew cups used with Kuerig machines.  I like to use two bags, though, to get a full-bodied flavor.  Even using two bags, it's still a fraction of the cost of the k-cups.

review/summary: Lovely delicate green tea - which just happens to be decaf
review/text: I adore this Celestial Seasonings Decaffeinated Green Tea! Before this, I had been drinking Stash Premium Green (with caffeine).  I had heard bad things about the taste of decaf teas in general so I was hesitant to try this decaf version from C.S. But, WOW, am I glad I did. This tea has so much more flavor, is so much more delicate and lovely than Stash could ever hope to be. And this is decaf! Remember when you brew green tea - it is best to use water that isn't quite hot enough to boil - that keeps your cup of green tea from getting bitter. (Conversely, black and herbal teas are best made boiling water) Also, do not brew it too long - meaning, don't go longer than the recommended time noted in the box flap - or you'll release more tannins and experience slight bitterness. Personally, I brew mine on the weak side (3 minutes) with not quite boiling water, I add 1/2 tsp of sugar, and milk .... pure heaven in a cup. Lovely fragrance, taste, and aftertaste. Others might say milk overpowers green tea, but I enjoy it. I believe this tea only contains 5 mg of caffeine per cup (decaf is never 100% free of caffeine) so you may drink it at night without worry about staying up all night, or if you doc recommends cutting down on caffeine, or if you simply want to give your tummy a break from irritating caffeine - this is the ticket. Enjoy!

review/summary: The perfect rice for making sushi
review/text: Kokuho Rose is a variety of medium-grained rice developed and grown in California by Koda Farms. It is very similar to Japanese rice (japonica), which is short-grained and fat. Introduced to the American market in 1963, it is well-suited for Japanese cuisine because it's very sticky and glutinous, having the same taste and texture as Japanese rice. It is a very popular choice for making sushi because it is relatively easy to find and inexpensive.<br /><br />To make sushi rice, the kernels have to be washed until the water is clear, then steamed. I use an electric rice cooker like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009E3F68">Panasonic SRG06FG 3-Cup Automatic Rice Cooker</a>, but you can get fancier ones that cost upwards of $100. Cooked perfectly, the grains are firm, slightly elastic and have a shiny, pearl-like luster.<br /><br />You should be able to find this at your local Asian supermarket, as it is a widely distributed brand. Some bigger American supermarkets may also carry it. Another popular brand is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HQKHUI">Nishiki Premium Rice</a>. These are the two major brands I use and recommend. If you can't find either of these, a third brand is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MCHN8Q">Botan Rice</a>.

review/summary: Inferior to other sticky rice brands
review/text: I tried this brand along with about 5 others while on a recent sushi making kick.  This rice was significantly inferior to several brands of other California grown sticky rice, as well actual sticky rice from Japan.  Rice came out more mushy than other brands - almost like it was overcooked, and on several occasions I would find a few hard pieces of rice mixed in with the rest.  It's passable, but definitely not preferred, especially if you are trying to make sushi or something else where rice texture is important. At the time of this review the price is $14.95 for a 5 lb bag, compared to $7.20 for the same bag at my local Japanese supermarket - the review grade does not reflect this price differential, recognizing that it could change.  I should point out however, that at $15 for a 5 lb bag, you can buy premium sticky rice imported from Japan in a decent Japanese supermarket.<br /><br />Update: Have added additional brands to my comparison list, this one really is on the bottom by far, I question whether the 5 star reviewers have tried any other options (just about any California short grain variety, Botan Calrose from the supermarket, Nishiki - all significantly better than this.)

review/summary: An astonished and ecstatic novice user
review/text: I'm quite the novice when it comes to rice, so I'm not going to deliver any lectures on the genetic and cultural history of sticky white rice. I just know that I like the sticky rice that I've gotten from the better Chinese take-out restaurants. I also know that the precooked rice packages I was preparing at home were too expensive and not that good. And it also seemed like a good time to stop eating too many potatoes.<br /><br />So I bought a bag of this rice, a bestselling Aroma rice cooker, and a good rice washing bowl. My selections weren't based on expertise. I just went with things at the top of Amazon's bestseller lists that were in an economical price range. I carefully rinsed enough rice for a dinner party of four, threw it all in the cooker, pushed two buttons, and checked it an hour later.<br /><br />Boy, was I ever amazed. This product produced the best sticky white rice I've had from anywhere--home cooking, take-out, restaurants. It has that nice glutinous quality that allows the rice clump to together in some of the most favorable mouthfuls I have ever had so far as white rice. This stuff is really a keeper. At the rate I'm going through  it, one bag might last 5-6 weeks. And that's for just one person.<br /><br />I guess this rice is good for sushi. I wouldn't know. I just like to load it on a plate, use some salt, crushed peppercorns, and soy sauce, and put something else (like an entree) off to the side. The rice is so good by itself, the entree is almost incidental.<br /><br />So I expect to be buying more very soon and highly recommend this. I also recommend the Aroma cookers, which are quite the bargain right now.

review/summary: Versatile and easy to love
review/text: I'd never tried this rice before, despite seeing it around forever and hearing good things about it. Finally picked up a bag when we ran out of our Lundberg Akitakomachi rice (good stuff -- try it), and was pleasantly surprised. I did rinse it several times until the water ran clear, and brought the cooking water up to just about my first finger joint. Brought it to a boil, then covered and let simmer for 15 minutes, then shut the heat and let it steam for about 20 minutes more.<br /><br />It has a very pleasant gloss and stickiness, along with a subtle, clean flavor. It's perfect for sushi, but I'll also use it alongside other Asian meals, since it's very chopstick-friendly. Our staple is usually Golden Phoenix Thai Jasmine, which is exceptional -- if you're lucky enough to find it, don't miss it; but I'll definitely start adding this rice into the rotation. The texture is quite delightful and a nice change of pace. If you enjoy moist, stickier rices for general eating as well as sushi, you'll find a lot of ways to use Kokuho Rose. But shop around, as the listed price is quite high for the amount of rice.<br /><br />I also picked up a bag of the same producer's sweet/glutinous rice, specifically to use for homemade rice wine. I was surprised to find it too bland for eating, but it worked just fine for the wine.

I bought similar rice at the local grocery store and have had perfect results with it almost every time.<br /><br />Looking at the other reviews makes me think it's something I'm doing wrong, but I have tried every combo of preparing that I can think of.

review/summary: SEARCHING FOR A PET APPETITE ENHANCER?
review/text: *********************************************************<br /> UPDATE:  READ THE UPDATE BELOW FIRST. Thanks. (June 15 and August 3, 2012)<br />*********************************************************<br />  I WAS, BUT NO MORE (actively anyway). We have four cats: two ("normals") who eat about anything, one with kidney disease (CRF/CKD) and accompanying reduced appetite, and one that has picky (and weird) tastes.  In the process of trying to find an appetite stimulant for the mom-cat (with CRF/CKD) I tried out several products on her and the others (the kids) as well.<br />Here are the results of this less than scientific (or definitive) survey:<br /><br />  Drs.Foster&Smith Shrimp Snappies Treats (ground to powder)-----------ALL REFUSED.<br />  Freeze-dried powders (Prowl and Ziwi Peak)----------------------------NO EFFECT. All but one (Ms. Picky) ate them.<br />  Seafood juices (tuna, oyster, sardine, etc.)-----------------------------NO EFFECT. All but (same) one ate them.<br />  Dry (ground to powder) cat food (Halo, EVO, Blue Fuffalo, etc.)---------NO EFFECT. Ditto acceptance.<br />  Canned cat food (gourmet brands & renal diets)------------------------Ditto.<br />  Hairball tube lubes (usual suspects & Cat Grass)------------------------Ditto.<br />  Mark&Chappells De Furr-ums treats------------------------------------Ditto.<br />  Calming chews & liquid (Pet Naturals)----------------------------------Ditto (except Ms. Picky accepted)<br />  Brewer's yeast(powder)-----------------------------------------------Dulled all appetites a bit; all accepted<br />  Barley Cat (GreenFoods; powder)--------------------------------------EFFECTIVE on mom-cat; others liked except...<br />Drs.Foster&Smith Tuna Treats (ground to powder)----------------------EFFECTIVE on mom-cat;  all others liked<br />  Bonito Sprinkles (Cat-Man-Doo)----------------------------------------EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE; ditto<br />  8in1 Dingo Anchovy Fillets (ground to powder)--------------------------Ditto (effect & acceptance)<br />  Tropical Fish Food (Sergeants Atlantis)---------------------------------Ditto (except Ms Picky liked; 2 normals NOT)<br />  Purina Whisker Lickins Tender Moments (Chicken flavor)-----------------BEST (effect & acceptance)<br />  Whiskas Temptations Treats (crumbled by hand)------------------------BEST (effect & acceptance)<br /><br />Most of the products were accepted by most of our cats but their appetites were not helped noticeably until I found the last seven: Barley Cat (separate review), Drs.F&S Tuna Treats, Cat-Man-Doo Bonito Sprinkles (reviewed here), 8in1 Dingo Anchovy Fillets, tropical fish food (I did not test the "regular" or "beta" but ingredients were similar and loaded with fillers and dyes; no reason to suspect that the brand is critical), Purina Whisker Lickins Tender Moments and Whiskas Temptations Treats (only "regular" Salmon and Chicken flavors tested). Only the Whiskas  Temptations were effective to the point of bringing all our cats' appetites back to the "relish" or "enthusiastic" stage. None of the products were "perfect": most lacking in some degree of effectiveness or acceptance and the regular Whiskas Temptations (?the "natural" versions?) lacking in quality ingredients and difficult to crush by hand. I have avoided brands like Whiskas for years on nutritional and ethical grounds but I will reluctantly use them in a flavor enchancer role until I find a more suitable alternative. Three of our four cats had weird responses to the tropical fish flakes: our two "normals" were absolutely repulsed and our Ms Picky licked her bowl clean.  Go figure.<br /><br />The Cat-Man-Doo (CMD) "sprinkles" I bought from HealthyPets.com for just a bit less than the price on Amazon. These are the only dehydrated bonito in "sprinkles" form (there is a TUNA DASH product out there but more expensive) that I could find. Other bonito products typically are  large flakes and more expensive. Although the CMD product comes in a shaker jar it is not a "sprinkles"  form like salt or pepper and does not shake out as easily or evenly; the "sprinkles" are still flakes, just a lot smaller. If you decide to further reduce the size of any of the products it is not necessary to pulverize them to a fine powder.  Generally they come out of a shaker container a little more uniformly if left slightly course. The Whiskas  treats, because of their soft center, are best crumbled by hand.  The Whiskas  products present the best value: about 300 servings for about $1.80 on sale at PetCo (and a bit less at Walmart). Purina Whisker Lickens come in several flavor varieties and, though equally effective, contain about 150 servings and are more expensive even on Amazons best terms (multi-pack and free shipping). Purina WL (3 oz) would have to sell for under $1 per pack off the shelf or with free shipping to be competitive. I found several of the products (DrsF&S, 8in1, Sergeants, Purina WL, and Whiskas) at a discount store (BigLots). Among the dried fish products, the CMD sprinkles do offer good value: about $2.80 per ounce (before shipping, taxes) and provide so many servings that I could not attempt to count or even estimate. If your pet gets turned on by CMD then, because of the prodigious number of servings, the CMD could be the better value. A word of caution on the CMD quantity: The listings and ads stated that the sprinkles jar contains 8 oz. NOT TRUE.  The company used a fluid ounce (volume) measure rather than a weight measure for this particular product.  The sprinkles jar contains at least 2 1/2 oz by weight. Even so, the price still beats other brands of bonito (and tuna) products that I ran across.  Credit to the company, however, since they packed the jar about as full as possible and they responded positively to my complaint about the choice of measures and confirmed that the labels, ads, and other marketing materials will be changed ASAP to state the 2 1/2 oz weight measure. Will they pack the jar as tight?  Cat-Man-Doo also is introducing a chicken sprinkles product (2 oz size).  I wonder: would our Ms. Picky take to that?<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Effective appetite enhancers are out there and probably one that matches the pickiest/weirdest of tastes.  The problem, as I discovered, is finding it.  As far as I can tell, there is no logic, no rhyme, no reason to use as a guide. Individual differences among cats seems to be the norm and consistency of preferences does not appear to be of any evolutionary value. Cases in point: our Ms. Picky.  She does not like flavors OF meat and fish  but loved the food flakes FOR fish; our "normals", who rarely refuse anything, were sorely offended by the same offering.  Personally, we now have reasonably priced go-to flavor enhancers for all our cats (Whiskas Temptations) and  back ups (Cat-Man-Doo Sprinkles) for all as well, even Ms Picky.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I powdered and combined the 8in1 Dingo anchovy product and the Cat-Man-Doo sprinkles, which suggests that other closely effective products may be mixed successfully. I did it just to use down the anchovies since they are relatively expensive and I probably would not purchase them at full retail price.<br /><br />So until their tastes change (again) we are no longer actively searching for appetite boosters.  Hope this review helps (with products or ideas) ANYONE ELSE (even dog companions) WHO IS STILL SEARCHING FOR A PET APPETITE ENHANCER.<br /><br />  ****************************<br /><br />UPDATE: AND THEIR TASTES DID CHANGE--REPEATEDLY. AND I ACQUIRED A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE after trying over four dozen flavor additives over the past year. There are two approaches to re-stimulating pet appetites; ON food or IN the pet; that is, from the outside in or the inside out. I WAS TAKING THE WRONG APPROACH, assuming that all I had to do was find the right product to add to my cats' food and Valla!, problem solved! The following are my personal conclusions after many months and conversations with several vets:<br />  1) Diminished appetite may be difficult to distinguish from strong preferences (picky-picky) and preference changes.<br />  2) Normally healthy pets experience swings in appetite (like, seasonal or during hairball buildup) and do not need extra appetite stimulants or treats (although you would never guess that from the explosion of treats on pet food aisles). Even pets that play or perform only expect approval, attention and affection. Everyday pet feed should provide an adequate level of sensory interest.  If not, then find an appropriate formula (or mix of brands and wet/dry) that does. Affordability may be an issue but "treats" are not cheap and I have not done the math to get a fix on the  pricepoint at which treats would become more expensive. In any event, off-the-shelf enhancers/treats may have a role in case of genetic or age-related sensory loss, as a short-term aid, as a palliative after a rough experience/day, or as a "last resort".<br />  3) Pets with known or suspected medical issues may need the inside-out approach. Additive appetite enhancers may not be much help if the reduction in appetite is due to a medical case. The short term benefit from (even the best) appetite additives (anywhere from one meal to several months), may be long enough to keep them going while the underlying medical issues and related appetite symptoms are resolved (or not). Some inside-out Rx appetite enhancers also may only work short-term (maybe up to 6 weeks); others may work if administered continually; the best (but not typical) outcome would be a jumpstart of the pet's natural appetite.<br />  4) Pets on a special diet (like calorie restriction or Rx) have fewer choices of feed and MAY benefit from added (outside-in) appetite enhancers to even the most palatable available special diet formulas. Expect short term results and anticipate having to cycle through various enhancer products frequently.<br />  5) One reason for the loss of "magic" of appetite enhancers is pet intelligence:  they may eventually figure out that they can "cherry pick" the tasty additive and leave the relatively unappetizing food; or "wait out" your first offering in anticipation of tastier follow-up offerings. BUT the flavor additives work better as sprinkles and tend to lose their magic if mixed in with the food.  I found this to be the case even if I "marianated" their regular food with the flavor enhancer in water prior to meals.<br />  6) I have used the phrases "flavor enhancer" and "appetite stimulant" interchangeably. There probably is a substantive difference but my interest was the end result (a hearty interest in meals and increased consumption).<br /><br />For those readers who are interested in further lists of products I have tried, I set out the items I have researched/used since the last report. They are organized a little differently, hopefully in a more useful fashion.  Besides the specific items, you may find the list helpful in generating further ideas to experiment with.  Unless noted otherwise, the off-the -shelf products were crumbled or pulverized if not already in powder form. Prior consultation with your vet would be advisable if not required, for the INSIDE-OUT types and may prove helpful  before venturing even into the realm of off-the-shelf and DIY flavor enhancers.<br /><br />THE INSIDE-OUT TYPES  (do not depend on the senses but work internally, if at all, to stimulate appetite):<br /><br />  Vitamin B-12 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Dexamethasone (Rx injectable steriod)<br />  Pro-biotics ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Depo-Medrol (Rx injectable anti-inflammatory )<br />  Pre-biotics ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Mirtazipine  (Rx anti-depressant pills)<br />  Exercise ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Cyproheptadine (Rx anti-histamine/serotonin pills and  compounded liquid)<br />  Charcoal (medical/food grades) ^^^^ Cerenia (Rx anti-nausia/inflammatory pill)<br />  Pepcid AC ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Zantac<br />  Oral Electrolytes (Non-Rx fluids like: Pedialyte, Caravet, Ions, Pets&Vets, and DIY recipes)<br />  Rx injectable Electrolytes ("Sub-Q" fluids)<br />  Rx Oral Electrolytes (like: Rebound OES)<br /><br />THE OUTSIDE-IN TYPES  (depend mainly on the senses of smell/taste to get the attention of the appetite):<br /><br />  Hills Science Diet AD (Rx) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Pet Vitamins  (Sargeants)<br />  Dental gel ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Liver (raw, sauteed; chicken & beef)<br />  Garmon VetClassics Cranberry chews (crumbled)^^^^Liver (human-grade dessicated/dehydrated; capsules/powdered)<br />  Cranberry (liquid)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Hairball "treats"<br />  Beefeaters Cod (freeze dried puffs)^^^^^^^^^^^Milk<br />  Cat Milk (Whiskas) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Chicken (freeze dried puffs)<br />  Clinicare RF ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Canned pet food (regular & Rx; seared/browned; crumbled)<br />  Lactulose (Foster & Smith)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Boutique canned food (like Fancy Feast)<br />  Spirulina (St. Jon Naturals)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Vienna Sausage(chicken; meat & broth)<br />  Vita Gravy ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Pet Naturals Calming Chews, tabs, liquid<br />  Friskies Crispies ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Mars Crave treats<br />  Pounce treats ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^JRBFoods Catty Shack treats (Walmart)<br />  "Super" Reds/Greens (human) powder ^^^^^^^^^^Bench & Field treats<br />  Other petmates dry food (powdered) ^^^^^^^^^^Foster&Smith Joint Care 2 (powder)<br />  Catnip (powdered)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^8in1 Kookamunga Catnip Spray<br />  Catsure liquid diet^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Rebound Liquid Diet<br />  Cheerios breakfast cereal (crumbled) ^^^^^^^^^^KMR (liquid)<br />  Vanilla extract (no alcohol)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Pet Greens (freeze-dried liver puffs)<br />  Natural Balance Platefulls-sardines (pureed) ^^^^^^My Little Lion (salmon)<br />  Natural Balance Perfect Bites (rabbit)^^^^^^^^^^ EVO Wild Cravings<br />  VetsBest Right Bites Health Management (dogs) ^^^Mixins (Variety Pet Foods)<br />  PureBites (Pure Treats Inc)freeze-dried liver puffs ^^<br /><br />MOST/LEAST EFFECTIVE Rx PRODUCTS:  There are differences; but best sorted out between you and your vet.<br /><br />MOST EFFECTIVE OF THE NON-Rx PRODUCTS:<br /><br />  In addition to the better ones (according to our cats) noted in the original list (Barley Cat thru Whiskas Temptations), add these to the BEST class::<br /><br />  Dessicated/dehydrated Liver (human grade) capsules/powder (go easy, may cause the runs)<br />  Seared/browned Canned Pet Food (regular and Rx)<br />  Vienna Sausage (chicked meat & broth)<br />  Catty Shack treats (crumbled)<br />  Natural Balance Platefulls-sardines<br />  Pet Greens Freeze Dried puffs (liver)<br />  Natural Balance Perfect Bites (rabbit)<br />  My Little Lion (salmon)<br />  EVO Wild Cravings (herring & Salmon)<br />  VetsBest Right Bites Health Management (dogs)<br />  Mixins (Variety Pet Foods)<br /><br />LEAST EFFECTIVE NON-Rx PRODUCTS:<br /><br />  In addition to the originally listed ineffective ones (again by unscientific poll of our cats): F&S Shrimp Snappies thru brewers yeast powder, add these:<br /><br />  Vita Gravy (Petsmart)<br />  Bench & Field treats (Trader Joes)<br /><br />ALL OTHER NON-Rx PRODUCTS<br /><br />  Most were accepted by all four cats but were not particularly effective as appetite stimulants in our trials. Your pets, especially the healthy ones, may respond more favorably.<br /><br />  IF I WERE STARTING OVER WHAT WOULD I DO?  (Supplementing my "perspective" points above) HERE ARE MY MAIN TIPS:  1) Get to know my pets' taste preferences in advance of any need  2) Check for medical causes  3) If no medical issues, switch to the other form (dry/wet) of the pet's regular food and try as a flavor enhancer topping and/or as a substitute  4) Then try  warming or browning the wet version of the pet's regular food  5) next, your best choice of a "treat" or supplement with the pet's favorite flavor used as a topping  6) then one with a liver taste, such as Barley Cat or Pet Greens Freeze Dried  7) Then Cat-Man-Do bonito sprinkles, Natural Balance Platefuls, Catty Shack treats, Purina Whisker Lickins, or Whiskas Temptations 8) If a product meets with initial acceptance, withhold judgment on "effectiveness" until after a few meals worth of experiences  9) forego trying all the hundreds of "treats" in search of "the" one that will work after you have gone thru your best shots  10) If there are medical issues, consider off-the-shelf and Rx appetite stimulants, singly or in combination  11) If a liquid meal substitute is called for consider REBOUND and CLINICARE RF, but also CATSURE and KMR and (as a last resort?) human versions of liquid renal failure products. Acceptance at this point will likely be a major issue but at least they are there for the trying.<br /><br />  My apologies for the awkward columns but I could not figure out a neat way to compress the information. Hope all this helps and Good Luck.

review/summary: Perfect Risotto--Every Time!
review/text: Sure, you've got to have some patience if making even a simple risotto with little ingredients, but it's the cooking time, the prep and then stirring, for about thirty minutes or so, that makes this so. If you're a rice lover though, and you've never tried making this creamy dish, you must give it a try! Not only is it easy to make, but it's one of those dishes that you can put on the table, roll out the impressive name it comes with (I just love the way risotto sounds when spoken) and you've got an impressive and tasty presentation for guests or even your family.<br /><br />It can be as simple as the great recipe on the box, which Amazon lists in the label description above, or you can fancy it up with some great grilled chicken or shrimp and crispy (or steamed if you prefer) veggies. I would recommend using a good wine, one you'd likely drink with your meal, since this only adds to the amazing flavor (cooking wines DO NOT do the trick!). Experiment with the recipe on the package if you want. Parmasan cheese is a great additive at the very end, it's rich pungent smell coalescing with the other flavors excellently, but don't be afraid to try some others,. i.e. fontina, asiago--heck, even some cheddars work great! When those short grains start to release their starches, the creaminess comes into play and you're almost ready to eat! The smells are devine and it's a dish you will not be able to resist. RiceSelect's risotto rice works great every time, making for the perfect risotto experience.

review/summary: I love Risotto!
review/text: Ever since first seeing Risotto being prepared on a Gordon Ramsay program, my boyfriend and I couldn't wait to try to make it ourselves.  Finding the correct rice (arborio) was difficult enough, and after trying the brands from 2 or 3 different stores, we decided RiceSelect made for the best Risotto.  We used to buy it at SuperTarget before finding it here on Amazon.<br /><br />Our basic recipe:<br /><br />Serves 3-4, as a side<br /><br />1 cup RiceSelect Arborio Rice/Risotto<br />1 tablespoon olive oil<br />1/3 cup cooking wine (we've tried all kinds)<br />4-5 cups chicken broth<br />1 - 1 1/2 cups grated parmesan cheese (NOT the powder kind)<br />1 tablespoon butter (optional)<br /><br />Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a shallow saucepan over medium heat and add risotto rice.  Stir risotto for a couple of minutes then add cooking wine.  CAUTION:  the wine will cook off rapidly and could cause steam that will burn you if you're not careful!  Stir 30 - 60 seconds until all wine has been absorbed then add 1 cup chicken broth.  SAME CAUTION AS ABOVE!  Stir constantly until broth has been absorbed, then add another 1/2 cup of broth.  Repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  Wait until the previous amount of broth has been absorbed/cooked off before adding the next.  It typically takes about 20 minutes to make the risotto.  You'll know you're ready for the next step when the Risotto is soft, but not mushy.  You'll notice as you're adding chicken broth, that most of the liquid will be absorbed or cooked off, leave you will a creamy base.<br />Remove risotto from heat and add one cup parmesan cheese.  Stir until melted.  Serve immediately.  Garnish with extra parmesan cheese.<br /><br />OPTIONAL:  if after adding parmesan, the risotto seems stiff, add one tablespoon of butter.  Or if you like butter, add butter! ;-)<br /><br />RiceSelect Arborio Rice/Risotto has consistently given us great results and we're always sure to have 2 or 3 containers in the pantry.

review/summary: Great even with a rice cooker
review/text: Great risotto.  I have bought this brand both in the general food stores and through Amazon.  Personally I think this brand is as good as some I find in specialty stores.<br /><br />Sometimes I take the time to fix risotto as it is traditionally prepared other times I just throw it in the rice cooker (with a few extra steps).  This rice turns out beautifully both on stove top and in the rice cooker.  It tends to be a bit creamier when prepared on stove top.  In the rice cooker it is a less creamy but still rich.<br /><br />This is my basic formula for the rice cooker<br /><br />1. Few tablespoons butter melting in rice cooker while I cut up an onion<br /><br />2. Sautee onion in butter when soft add rice<br /><br />3. Sautee rice a few minutes (here I will add dry herb and fresh garlic)<br /><br />4. Add 1/4 cup dry white wine or lemon juice for every cup of rice stir until absorbed by rice<br /><br />5. Add 1/2cup chicken broth stirring until aborbed<br /><br />6. Add remainder of chicken broth (I typically use 2 to 2.5 cups per cup of rice) close rice cooker and let it do its thing<br /><br />7. Toward end of cycle check rice add more liquid if needed (here I sometime add 1/2 cup of cream, water, chicken broth, or 1/4 cup lemon juice)  this is also where I will add fresh herbs if I am using them<br /><br />8. When done I sometimes add shredded parmesan cheese

review/summary: Bugs in it
review/text: After using the rice twice over several months, I was cleaning out my pantry and saw bugs crawling around in the rice.  The jar was tightly sealed and nothing else in my pantry had bugs.  My only conclusion is that the eggs were in the rice to begin with.  Gross!

review/summary: Quick-cook risotto, too absorbent & looses shape easily.
review/text: This particular brand of risotto seems to have been further refined to be a quick cook risotto.  While this is very convenient for the home cook to get a risotto-style dish to the table in 20-mins instead of 40, the resulting texture is dry and even gummy because the grain continues to absorb the sauce and loose its shape even as it is ladled out for service.  Once everyone is ready to eat, the chances are that there is no sauce and the rice is overly soft.<br /><br />To be able to gauge this precisely one needs to make this in the traditional way (instead of in a pressure cooker) and pulling out before done, all the while reserving some sauce on the side to be poured on the rice at service.  Because of its enhanced-absorbent nature, this rice will continue to absorb any moisture and is unsuitable to be eaten as leftovers unless morphed into a different dish such as a porridge or arancini (rice ball).<br /><br />In essence, this is a quick-cook type of risotto that is mainly for a cook-now-eat-instantly type of meal.  If serving risotto as part of a longer more elaborate meal, use another brand as this will not sit well on the plate.
