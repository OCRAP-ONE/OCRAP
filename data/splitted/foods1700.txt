review/summary: The best so far
review/text: Due to allergies on the part of one dog, and pickiness on the part of the other, I've switched to natural dog food over the past year.  Of them all, my dogs love this stuff the best.  It has a nice smell and texture, and is more easily chewed by the elderly dog.  Relatives who hadn't seen the dogs for a few months immediately commented on the healthier appearance and renewed vigor of the dogs.

review/text: This is all I feed my baby. She is a 12 year old Boston Terrior. She has allergies but this is the only food I have found that does not break her out. It is easy to digest and keeps her wieght under control. She likes the taste and it has the great stuff for her skin in it. If your dog is having skin problems I hightly recommend trying this food. It is the BEST!!!

review/summary: No more gas
review/text: Boxers are known for being susceptible to gas. My Boomer is aptly named, but since switching to Wellness dry with about a third of a can of Wellness canned food, fed once  a day, he stays slim, energetic and blessedly flatulance-free. I also note, over a few months, that skin bumps are disappearing. I've tried several top brands, and this seems the most healthful.

review/text: I highly recommend ALL Wellness products!! My Shih Tzu's were plaqued with severe allergy problems,, Spent $$$$ after $$$$ at vet for relief for them, nothing seemed to work.. I did extensive research on dog food and found out the mainstream brands are all crap, nothing but by products, additives, nothing natural about any of them.. Did research on Wellness and Blue Buffalo, look them up, you will find out for yourself.. Their products are all natural, no additives, no preservatives, 100% meat from animals that are NOT fed growth hormones, etc.. My dogs have been on this food, both wet and dry and they are thriving and the picture of health, bright eyes, shiny coats, full of energy and NO MORE allergies..

review/summary: this cured my dogs allergies!
review/text: I have a Shih Tzu that will be soon turn 3.  I had her on a grain free Chicken diet until several months ago when she started having allergy problems.  Her constant licking and scratching drove me thru the roof.  My vet put her on a very expensive pill (like $60 a month), and recommended to me that I find her a diet with one "novel" protein.<br /><br />So, I went on-line and did some research.  Wellness was always something I was curious about.  I went on their website and found out that I could get some free samples.  After speaking with their customer service rep, I was informed that this Whitefish and Sweet Potato formula was their number one food recommended for dogs with allergies.  So, the company mailed me two trial size bags of this kibble.<br /><br />Well, it worked.  I've had my dog on this food for about 5 months now and she's completely stopped her licking and scratching in about a month.  I slowly weaned her off of her prescription allergy pill as well.  My vet is very, very impressed.<br /><br />I would give this food 10 stars if I could!

review/text: After bouts with Pancreatitis in both of my schnauzers (neither are overweight, but have major sensitivities to fat content), this is the only food I can feed them without worrying if it's right for them.  It has no corn, which is fantastic--unlike other cheaper brands.  It might be $10 more than you're used to spending on dog food, but it is worth it.  They are your family and deserve to eat as well (or better--haha) than we do.  I love my dogs more than anything which is why I will only feed them this.  (They love it too!!)

review/summary: Package and shipping issue
review/text: I rarely leave negative feedback, but I was shocked by how this product was packaged.  I understand that it is dog food, but a little more time and thought could have gone a long way and not have caused me the pain of what I experienced when the box was opened.  First, the box was the same size as the bag of dog food and had no additional packing.  I'm fairly certain the bag was opened or starting to open prior to being packaged and shipped.  Needless to say, when the package arrived via UPS, I opened it in the garage and the contents of the bag went everywhere.  Half of the bottom of the bag was open.  I lost at least half of the bag.  In addition, I don't know how long the bag was sitting opened.  It's probably not an issue with dry dog food, but you never really know.  All I can say is I wouldn't buy an opened bag of dog food at the pet store.  What I intended as a convenience of having this brand of dog food shipped directly to me, turned into a wasted amount of food and a lot of clean up.  I gave a shipping review to Amazon last week, but there was never any "I am sorry for your inconvenience" or any other type of apology.  I'm gathering these reviews are only spot checked.<br />The Wellness dog food itself seems to be a high quality dog food that my dogs enjoy.  I'm just very reluctant to purchase this through Amazon again.  If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have taken some pictures and posted them online. I was so irritated and it's just not worth the time for this particular product to do a RMA.  Buyer beware.

The only con it is a little pricey. But if your loooking for a good deal shop here. Pets mart and Pet co will charge you 7.00 or more in shipping. Amazon gave me free shipping you can not beat that!!! and usually the stores wont carry such a large bag. Def a good product if your dog is unactive and overweight.

review/summary: Happy Chihuahua
review/text: My long haired chihuahua is overweight. Her ideal weight is approximately 6-7lbs, however she currently weighs approximately 9lbs (this is my fault, I overdid it on the treats). She loved her Wellness brand super5mix adult formula for small breeds kibble, but I recently noticed the small breeds weight reduction version being sold at PetSupermarket, and decided to switch her over.<br /><br />I was worried she would not like it, as I had once unsuccessfully tried to switch her over to the other Wellness Super5Mix weight control kibble (purple bag, normal sized kibble). Surprisingly she took to the taste of the Wellness Small Breed Weight Control kibble almost immediately. I didn't even need to ween her off of the Wellness original kibble, just gave her the weight control formula and she liked it, no problems with her digestion. The color of the kibble is slightly less brown than the original adult formula, but she did not seem to notice a difference at all. She likes the small size of the kibble, and recently I have noticed that she has lost about 4 ounces... not much but it is a start. Hopefully with exercise and some restraint by me, she will be within her normal weight range, but I am happy I made the switch and will continue to purchase this brand.<br />TIP: My dog is a picky eater, so I sometimes mix a bit of water into the food which causes the food to give off an aroma, which draws her to it. It also makes it easier for her to eat because it softens the kibble. It's also good because it keeps her hydrated... Just an FYI.

review/summary: The best dog food
review/text: This is a phenomenal pet food.  I have used it for 5 years with two dogs and it's wonderful.  First, they think that it's delicious of course and eagerly eat it day in and day out. Second, it's been crucial for my pet's health.  Dog 1 had allergies and was scratching and putting her paw into her mouth.  After going on this food, she no longer had those issues and her coat looks fab. She's a black lab mix.  Dog 2 was adopted with horrendous inflammatory bowel problems and suspected allergies to common proteins.  We had to start him on a very restricted diet of only novel proteins and chose the Wellness Simple food.  He didn't enjoy it as much and when he was stable, we switched him to this and he did great.  He loves it and it has kept his gut stable.  Also a lab mix and his coat looks great on this food.  We use both the Wellness fish kibble and canned food.  Highly recommend.  It's pricey but as someone else said, cheaper than the vet bills!

review/summary: Attention AMAZON:
review/text: I think Amazon is doing a disservice to Wellness Dry Dog Food by mingling all the reviews together rather than separating the opinions out, based on the particular type and "flavor" of the Wellness food being reviewed.  I was researching the food for SMALL BREEDS and zeroed in on that particular type, but the reviews were all over the place talking about many of the other varieties.<br />My experience with using the dry Wellness for Small Breeds, both the regular type and the Healthy Weight type has been excellent.  All out mini dachshunds love the food, have beautiful coats and are very healthy.  My only suggestion is that they offer the SMALL BREED variety in super size bags.  Buying 12 lbs at a time is ridiculous when one is feeding multiple dogs, and many of us with little guys, have more than one..... the potato chip theory, right?

My dog was 2-3 pounds overweight and i had a very hard time finding a dog food which is good in nutritions and its low in fat. After 1 month my dog became lean and much more energized eating wellness healthy weight dog food. I believe all overweight dogs should be on this diet, its trully wonderful! I've tried other brands to help my dog lose those extra pounds, along with long walks, but this is the best! The best holistic weight management dog food.

review/summary: Best brand out there...
review/text: I have 7 dogs.  All various breeds and sizes.  I was looking for a brand without additives that all my dogs would benefit from.  I have a few that need to lose weight.  Wellness makes the best product.  I buy the small bites for my little ones....pieces are small and they love it.  I but the Healthy weightCORE for my "dieters" and mix it with canned green beans or peas and carrots.  So far my Golden, who was an overweight rescue at 129 pounds, has lost 19 pounds -- she's been on this food for about 7 months.  I buy the original CORE version for my baby bulldog, who had a lot of gas.  No more smells and ripples in the night!  Amazon has the best price for Wellness. And its shipped right to my home -- no lugging big bags back and forth.  Yes, it's more expensive than the other stuff--but it really works.  And that will cut down on future vet bills.  All my dogs are healthy and have nice shiny coats.  Priceless!  Wellness now has a SIMPLE version for those dogs who suffer with food allergies.  A family member has a little Teddy Bear with severe skin issues -- she'd scratch until raw and bloody.  She switched to the SIMPLE version of Wellness and has been itch free ever since.  Again...great brand!

review/summary: Stop the scratching!
review/text: Dogs probably don't really want to spend most of their lives scratching, but it seems that's what they do.  After trying many foods on two dogs, Wellness has stopped that.  It must be the natural ingredients because when I've tried "supermarket brands" they go back to scratching again.  Thanks, but I'll just stick with this.  Coats are shiny, even after swimming and mud baths.  It's expensive compared to "supermarket brands" but a bargain compared to other holistic dog foods and the vet bills we used to have!  Many years ago, we started feeding it to our black lab and he showed significant improvement in a couple of days.  After he died, (he was 14) we eventually got a golden retriever pup and tried him on the cheaper food but he showed the same signs of scratching and dull coat.  We put him on Wellness and all symptoms cleared up quickly.

review/summary: Perfect for mini schnauzer
review/text: First let me say that every time i read some of the dog food recipes on the labels i begin to think that there are real bits and pieces of fish in the bag. lol but no. This dog food is phenomenal. My miniature schnauzer had been on puppy chow before i got him.( not the best) however i made the foolish decision to transition a pure breed mini schnauzer from puppy chow to Purina One. And that's when the problems started. My dogs coat went from a nice black with brown highlights to a black coat with his pale white skin showing under it. He looked sooooo sick and his coat felt really dull and wiry. He refused to eat any more of the Purina one and so i had to think fast. I had remembered that a breeder website (bijou poodles i was thinking about getting one) had listed some top grade dog food as one of their links. So i so Wellness Core as a good choice. Well I decided to go with the fish and sweet potato recipe and my dog was not disappointed. He loves the food and has began to get a lot of his color back.<br /><br />Bag: Very loud bag package. Plus i don't really like the resealable feature since it does not come with a zip lock. However if my dog gets into the dog food bag the material food be so loud my neighbors wood here it.<br /><br />Smell: awesome he lost his cool as sooon as i cut the bag open.<br /><br />Quality/quantity: Wellness does not do like some companies and make the bag really big, while theirs less than half the dog food in the bag. 15 pounds is exactly that, 15 pounds. Also my mini would eat a lot of the puppy chow at one time. However with Wellness he only needs about a half a cup and hes full!

review/summary: Best dog food we have fund
review/text: Wellness is by far the best dogfood we have ever fed our yellow lab.  Though it is expensive, we figure we spend the same amount  or less than we would through purchasing a cheaper food as we would need to feed more for the same caloric intake.  We get by with a thirty pound bag about once a month or so.  Our lab's coat is healthy, he has high energy, and his "movements" are solid... May be too much information.  However, that is one of the big differences I notice with cheaper dog foods.  To help with further comparison, our lab is 8 years old, is an active hunter nine months out of the year (waterfowl spring and fall, rabbits, upland birds), and he is an indoor family dog.

review/summary: Happy with the product
review/text: My dog was suffering with itchy skin.  He had been eating Natural Choice brand (cheaper) since he was a puppy.  I was nervous to change foods.  The vet suggested to change foods sand see if the skin issues cleared up.  Wellness brand did the job.  My dog seems to love the food and the skin issues cleared up within a few weeks.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: We have a black female lab. And since she was little she would not eat anything but pedigree and as long as shd was fine we gave it to her. For the past 3 months she was licking her paws, itching, she had bald spots. I treated her with different kind of oitments which brought her coat back at thr bald spots however she was still licking and itching, shaking. We finally decided to change her food from that horrible by products pedigree to wellness and two days later less itching licking and everything. Although it is pricey i dont care she is herself again!

review/summary: Great, high quality food
review/text: I will no longer feed my dog(s) standard grocery store foods though I did have a cocker spaniel live almost 17 years mostly on that before I knew better. This is a very good food. Good ingredients (meat should always be the first ingredient, not corn, wheat, etc). Can be a little pricey, so you may have to shop around, but it is worth it. You will occasionally find dogs that can't tolerate certain foods and this is no exception. So far hasn't been a problem for my dog after > 2 years of this particular type. Breed: Giant Schnoodle, ~66 lbs. He loves fish so this is perfect. If we're having fish for dinner (tuna, baked tilapia, etc), you can be assured he'll be nearby with his nose turned up somewhere sniffing around.

review/summary: My picky Husky loves this
review/text: I have a chow mix and a husky. My chow eats anything and is on the Wellness Healthy Weight (chicken flavor). My husky is really picky. She finally ate the Wellness puppy chow when she was a puppy after refusing to eat many other brands. At almost 2 years old I really wanted to change her to "big girl" dog food. She is still pretty skinny, because she is so active and still did not eat very much. I decided to switch her to the Wellness Core, but she constantly vomited. So I got the Wellness Fish and Sweet Potato since her puppy food had sweet potato in it too - hoping that she would eat it. NOPE. I guess she does not like fish!!! :-( Then I noticed that she likes my chows chicken flavored food, but the low calorie food was not ideal for her since she needs to put on a few lbs. So I finally tried this one ......... and BINGO ........... She LOVES IT!!! She can't get enough of it and always wants more. I am very happy with this food!!! And even better - it shipped from a location 30 min from my house, so ones it was shipped I had it the next day! The price is also about $10 lower than where I used to order Wellness before!!! So this is where I will always get it from now on! Thanks for fast shipping and a great price! I also recommend Wellness - its really a great food with real meat and NOT byproducts and tons of corn! ;) Your dog will love you for getting a great food!!! :)

Given the quantity it is much the same price as the stuff they sell at the supermarket. It doesn't have the yummy "chicken in a biscuit" smell but it is way more nutritious according to all the internet investigation that I've done.

review/text: My puppy loves it, and I love my puppy.  She doesn't eat a whole lot just yet, but she will soon.  Looks like it costs about $50-$60 for a month's supply.  Considering that I spend that much on myself in a week, I'll gladly spend that much on my sweet Layla for a month.  The better you spend on dog food, the less you'll spend in the veterinarian's office.  And that's exactly what I told my vet when I took her in for her rounds of shots, and she agreed wholeheartedly.  She only wants my money for routine office visits.  I firmly believe that Wellness dog foods will help ensure that you only take your beloved pet to the vet for routine maintenance.

review/summary: Picky dog gobbles it up!
review/text: I have two rescue chihuahua mix dogs (2yr old chiweenie 19 lbs. & 7mo jack-chi 9.6 lbs.). Both have started turning into butterballs from extra treats given during training as well as not enough walks, and could each lose 1-3 pounds. We've stepped up exercise but I still wanted a food that would help maintain their weight because they're both low to the ground and weight gain prone. My bf and I have been searching and searching for the "right" food to give them both. The choices and information on dog food is insane and combined with finding food they'll both eat is head spinning!<br /><br />The bigger/older one is super picky about all food and is known to spit out treats he doesnt like and to not even sniff new foods he hasn't experienced until u show him or break it up for him, but the little one will gobble anything in a flash. Previously we've had the oldest on Kirkland brand adult food and while he doesn't "love" it, he'll eat it with some waffling and overall its proven to keep him solidly healthy. After getting the 2nd pup who has typical jrt skin sensitivities I started researching foods to help him out and switched him from blue buffalo puppy to blue wilderness (also he stopped growing up and started growing out bc of too much puppy food richness which our older one also experienced when he was transitioning to adult). (As most know small dogs can stop growing much sooner compared to large dogs.) We tried to feed blue wilderness to the older one but found that he definitely turned his nose at it and given half and half portions preferred Kirkland over blue. In general I think blue is an awesome food but tends to be a little too calorie dense for our guys. Combined with their recent chubbiness and based on great reviews and ingredients, I decided to try Wellness Super5mix Healthy Weight for small breeds.<br /><br />We've only just bought some a few days go so I'll have to report back on weightloss, but we were super excited that based on first a small sample to each, then second when we mixed a meal with their old food they both immediately gobbled up the food. This is amazing because our oldest has always seemed to tolerate his kibble but hasn't ever loved any brands we've tried to date. This is the first time he's started eating a new food immediately!! My bf is also happy bc he would rather feed them the same thing than to have separate kinds for each like we were doing. I'm pretty sure we've found the "it" food that works for us!!!

review/summary: NOT involved in the recall
review/text: I have used this Wellness fish formula for 8 years for my dogs. This food is a super high quality food for dogs as well as having some healing attributes that make it very healthy for seizures and liver issues. My Schipperke's are doing very well on this formula and no longer require Phenabarb or any seizure medication and the liver studies on their blood work are almost normal at 13 years of age after serious liver problems 8 years ago.<br /><br />Wellness tests All batches for problems prior to distribution. They did give a voluntary recall on the puppy formula even when it tested out with no contamination. I also feed the senior dog formula to my 100 pound German Shepherd dog as I believe it has given him wonderful joint health help as he ages.

review/summary: Some Diamond Pet Food Wellness are RECALLED
review/text: I don't know if this particular one is recalled though. Just though I'd give a heads up though.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying.

review/summary: Makes my beautiful dog more beautiful!
review/text: We have an 8 month old beagle mix.  We were given a bag of Science Diet when we brought her home from the shelter and she wouldn't eat that.  My daughter picked up a bag of Iam's puppy food and that's what we were giving her the first month. Her poops smelled so bad from day one when we got her and didn't improve on the Iam's.  She seemed to have consistently runny poops as well.  She was also constantly itchy and scratching at herself.  We switched to Wellness puppy food and after the initial introduction for her to get used to that brand we haven't looked back.  She loves it!  She is now on the adult formula even though she's not quite a year old (read that beagles should be switched over to adult food at about 6 months because they have reached their full height).<br /><br />We are finishing up her second bag on the adult formula and she is looking beautiful, sleek and healthy.  We have so many people comment about how pretty she is and, especially, how soft her fur is. Her poops rarely smell and when they do it is usually because she was given new treats/snacks or one she hasn't had in awhile.<br /><br />I have seen some reviews (mostly from the puppy formula) with people complaining about runny stools but it is important to gradually get your dog used to any new dog food and gradually build up the amount by mixing it with the dog food you are replacing.  We even did this when we switched from the puppy to adult formula even though it probably wasn't as necessary to do that as both were the lamb formulas.<br /><br />She's full of energy and very happy and seems to love her dog food as she always eats it up and sometimes will carry in her bowl looking for seconds!!<br /><br />Also love how fast this company ships out the dog food too!  Whoever was selling the puppy chow would take awhile for it to arrive but this one usually shows up in a day or two.  Do wish this was available at our local market though!

review/summary: after 10 years my dog feels great!
review/text: My dog is an 11 year old pitbull and has had a sensitive stomach, reoccurring chronic ear infections, and was always licking her paws since she was a puppy. She would get up to walk around and immediately throw up for no reason. This would happen sometimes several times a day. Her symptoms were similar to acid reflux in people.I took her to 3 different vets for these issues separately (never realizing they could all be connected). She was on nausea medications, antibiotics for her ears, and several different ear washes. Nothing completely cured any of her issues. After doing a lot of research, i came across Wellness white fish and sweet potato and couldn't be happier. Over a 10 day period, i slowly changed over her food from the Iams i had been feeding her. It has now been about 3 months and she is a completely different dog. Since fully switching over to this food, she hasn't thrown up once and she is no longer scratching at her ears. She has more energy and always wants to play. I no longer have to coax her into eating by mixing in wet food with the Iams. She wags her tail when she sees me filling her bowl now and eats right away. She even licks the bowl when she is done and looks at me for more. If your dog has any of the same symptoms my dog had, you should definitely give this food a try. It might not be a fix for every dog but it doesnt hurt to try. It worked for my dog!

review/summary: Excellent Dog Food For Some
review/text: I have a 6 year male old lab mix that has had numerous problems with allergies, skin irritations, and digestive issues that could not be fixed through steroid injections or expensive medications.  When he was young I fed him Beneful and he did okay for a bit and then he would have medical issues.  Through expensive medical treatment, we would get him back to normal but it was only a short time before the next outbreak.  I tried everything.  Supplement pills, different foods, allergy medication, steroids, limited diet and nothing seemed to work.  He would get better and then back to being bad with him constantly itching, chewing his skin, and he just looked miserable.  It seemed as though this cycle would never end.<br /><br />Then while visiting my brother who owns a collie recommended this food because I kept commenting on how healthy he looked and how soft his fur was.  I was hesitant at first because I had tried so much and nothing had seemed to work.  I gave the Wellness Super5mix whitefish and sweet potato a chance.  All I can say is that he no longer has ANY skin irritations, his fur is shinny and soft, he has a lot more energy, and overall I would say he is in his best health every.  The change came after about 3 weeks of him eating the food.  We use to have to bath him once a week and with the Wellness food we bath him maybe once a month.<br /><br />But I will say this food will not have the same effect for every dog.  As some of the others on here have stated that their dog had loose stool issues and the dogs simply refusing eating the food, this is very true.  My other dog has no allergies what so ever and I figured if it worked for the one dog it should be fine for the other so I would only have to buy one type of food.  The non-allergic dog began eating the Wellness and had immediate issues with loose stool and upset stomach.  So I keep him on his old food which is just the average food you would find in any pet store.<br /><br />Give it a shot if you have exhausted all other efforts.  All I can say is that my dog is in his best health ever and it was only due to a better diet and more attention and with the help of Wellness.  I would recommend this food to anyone who shares similar dog problems as I have experienced.

review/summary: Quality kibble from a brand you can trust
review/text: My dog was experiencing skin allergies and had actually chewed her tail down to the bare skin. Her once shiny, lustrous coat had become dull and flaky and she was putting on extra weight to boot. After a trip to the vet (where she got a clean bill of health but I was told that she was about 8 pounds too heavy) I immediately switched her to this food and scaled back her portions on the advice of the vet. It's been about 6 weeks and the results are clearly visible. The scratching and the hot spots are gone, the coat gleams once again and the dog has shed most of the excess pounds.....she really seems to enjoy the kibble and happily scarfs it down when put in her bowl.<br /><br />Dogs react differently to different foods but I highly recommend giving this one a shot. It's worked wonders for my pup.

review/summary: Worth the price
review/text: I adopted a 6 month-old dalmation-pit recently and when I brought him home he had watery, disgusting smelling stools. I tried Natural Balance, which didn't really make a difference, and Before Grain, which he liked but it didn't have any effect on his poop. I did some research and decided to try the chicken super5mix and after mixing it into his food for about a week or so his stools became significantly less watery and it takes him about half the time to do his business than before (where I would watch him struggle and it looked painful and sad :( wonder what they fed him at the shelter ). He's my first puppy and I noticed that after a long time in the sun/we go out for a jog, he would have this weird funky smell like rotting chicken. I'm guessing that's his sweat smell. After about two weeks on Wellness the smell decreased SIGNIFICANTLY! His coat is also glossier. Leonidas hasn't been on this food for that long so I'm a bit hesitant to attribute the change just to food.. but I really think that's what it is. Bought the 15-lb bag to test it out last time, just ordered the 30. I'll try to remember to update this after he finishes it :)<br /><br />P.S. he also has MUCH less gas. win-win for both Leonidas and myself (but more for myself)

review/text: I love this brand. If you go to their website, sign up for their newsletters. They'll send you $3.00 off coupons every couple of months or so. No so helpful when purchasing through amazon but helpful if you have a local store with Amazon similar pricing like I do ;)<br /><br />My dog loves this food. He suffered from some stomach problems when he was a puppy so I switched him to Innova. I loved Innova, but my puppy didn't - his hair became oily, he didn't seem interested in the food, he began to smell bad, and the stomach issues continued. I did more research, switched to Wellness, and everything cleared up! I like the clean ingredients, the way his coat looks, and how he NEVER has bad breath or puppy farts. Ever.

review/summary: Best food on the market ...
review/text: Great food for my pooch's coat and helps her produce a consistent stool. Switched from Nutro Natural Choice, which was fine too, but considering they are both priced in the same neighborhood and Wellness has a higher protein content, this made more sense.<br />But I probably wouldn't have switched from Nutro if it wasn't for all those recalls a few years back -- it really freaked me out. My dog is glad I switched.

review/summary: Golden Retrivers Love It!
review/text: if you have a golden whose hair tends to smell, this product will significantly reduce the problem. When I adopted my golden, she was extremely overweight and she didn't smell that great. After a few weeks of eating this dog food which was recommended by a friend, she began to lose weight and smell better. It is now about a year and a half later and she's in great shape and smells like a dog. The product does not contain any corn.

review/summary: Healthier coat in a week
review/text: We rotate foods with our one year old. Went from a poultry mix to the fish and his coat is so much softer after only three weeks. Seems to be extremely palatable, and our pup had no issues switching over. He's extremely active so we've been feeding him a little more than the recommended amount on the bag, and his weight and energy level have remained constant. Wonderful food thus far -- no stomach or gas problems, just a mild case of fish breath. Would recommend to anyone!

review/text: Our dog loves this food. We tried the salmon and the whitefish flavors also but he clearly likes the chicken the best. We have only used wellness for our dog and his coat remains shiny, he is at an appropriate weight and full of energy, and has healthy bowel movements. I think this is the best you can get and well worth the price in the longevity your beloved pet gains in eating a healthy, natural diet.

review/summary: Too High On Carbs, Low On Protein
review/text: I am not rating this food with three stars because I dispute the quality of ingredients, or that it's one of the healthiest commercial dog food available on the market. Wellness is an excellent brand, more importantly, one whose quality control I trust. My dogs are doing fairly well on it, too, however, the reason I cannot give the Super 5 Mix a five star review is for the unusually low levels of protein and fat, which are not suitable for my highly active Beagles.<br /><br />My dogs spend as much time outdoors as they do snoring on the couch (which is a lot), and unfortunately, the 22/12 ratio of fat:protein does not cut it for them. By most standards 22% is a very low amount for even a maintenance diet, and despite the inclusion of whole grains, fruits, and veggies, I've found that I need to add oils and meat on a daily basis because their coats have been thinning out/shedding more than usual and their muscle mass has definitely decreased in the several weeks I've been feeding it. I'm very disappointed because it's only the middle of summer, when they normally maintain their coat very well and are less active than in the cooler months. Energy levels are also not very good... I am seeing spikes and crashes which is usually indicative of a high carbohydrate feed, so alas, will have to find another, more meat based diet for my pack. Although I would still recommend this for less active dogs - it's just not right for mine.

review/text: I remember when it was almost impossible to find oragnic dog treats online. Amazon rocks when it comes to buying organic dog treats! I ususally get my treats from doggiemunchies.com because of the quantities and flavors they offer, however I decided to try the 30 pound bag of organic dog food to offer both organic treats from doggiemunchies.com and the food from Wellness.

review/text: We have two Large Yellow Labrador Retrievers. One has always been fine with a higher end large breed grocery store brand. The other, developed terrible ear problems over time, after trying other remedy's we finally started changing foods, and found Wellness brand cleared up the ear problem within days! Sometimes mild ear irritations would come back, although in a very mild form as compared to before.<br /><br />A few months ago, we decided to try the Wellness Chicken, and the ear problems are gone. Another benefit is, so is their Gas!<br /><br />The dogs love the food, are still just as active, and look just as healthy as they always have. Plus they love helping open the box that the food comes in when picked up off of the front porch!<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon and Prime we do not have to search pet stores that are always out of this stuff, and we can have dog food on our doorstep within 2 days! All of this without paying crazy shipping costs.<br /><br />Keep it up Amazon, and Wellness.

review/summary: NOT worth the money
review/text: Like most commercial dog foods, Eukanuba is mostly garbage, full of by- products, fillers and grains that dogs do not need for health. While this is certainly not the worst dog food out there, it is far from the best and absolutely not worth anywher near the price it commands. Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13.

I called Amazon and they were happy to refund the cost. However, having ordered perishable items before, they always came with some type of cooling agent in them so the items would be in the same fashion as they were shipped. Think twice about ordering these candy bars. By the way, Amazon was not the shipping agent. These came from a seller who didn't bother to send me an email as to who to contact.

review/summary: Worse than the average bulk organic navy bean from health food stores
review/text: Even though these beans seemed fresh, they had terrible flavor. They were way worse than the average navy bean from the bulk bins of my local health food stores. After cooking one batch, I ended up throwing the rest in the garbage.<br /><br />I've been frustrated by the uneven quality of beans from my local health food stores. Sometimes great, sometimes terrible -- often the beans are very old, even though the stores I shop from are busy and have high turnover of beans. So I've been on a mission to find a mail-order source of consistently great beans. For navy beans, these are not it -- or at least this batch wasn't it. (Note: I did like Eden Foods kidney beans, so I'm not criticizing the brand.)

review/summary: Delicious and unique
review/text: I have only recently discovered "unprocessed" honey, and I cannot begin to describe what a difference there is between real, untreated honey and the stuff that is commercially available in those little plastic bears in the grocery store.  It's light night and day.  I never used to like honey, but this has become one of my favorite foods, and is an excellent alternative to sugar or artificial sweeteners in tea.<br /><br />It has a very rich texture, with a mouthfeel that is different from regular honey (more granular, but not in a bad or distracting way).  It also has a subtle floral, honeysuckle taste on top of the overall sweetness.  The only issue that I had with this honey is that initially there was a thin layer (~1/4 inch) at the top of the jar that was reminiscent of marshmallow fluff, and was disappointing in both flavor and texture. I'm assuming this is just normal separation, either scooping this part off or just making sure to thoroughly mix the jar before eating would probably eliminate this problem.

Gradually made the change from her old food to the new and she hates it. She has thrown up twice so far. I will be taking my loss and throwing the rest out. Back to her old food. It may be great for some dogs, just didn't work for mine.

review/summary: Made both my dogs vomit and eat less.
review/text: We switched to this food from Purina One because the ingredients are advertised to be of much higher quality, and we wanted to improve our dogs' diet. We made a smooth transition to this food by slowly mixing it in with their existing food, as vets recommend. Once the transition was complete, they were vomiting their meals several times per week, which they had never done before the switch. We continued to feed them this food for about a month to see if it changed, and they still have problems keeping it down. I often see them eating grass to induce vomiting as well, so I think its giving them a stomach ache. They also got to the point where they just didn't want to eat the food at all sometimes, which I've never seen them do. We switched to Newman's Own dog food now, and they're eating much better already.<br /><br />I wish I had done some research on this food before purchasing it. Type "Wellness dog food vomit" into Google, and you'll see what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product.

review/summary: Finally found a food that works for my dog
review/text: Jaz has food allergies that cause him to have diarrhea and gas. The Wellness Super5Mix dry dog food, chicken recipe, is the best food that I have found to control his symptoms. He eats it twice a day, with some canned food, also. No diarrhea, no gas, and his coat is super shiny!

review/summary: High quality dog food worth the price
review/text: Wellness Super5Mix is a high quality dog food. Yes, it costs more than the junk you can buy in Wal-Mart, but as with most things in life, you get what you pay for.  Wellness keeps my beagle regular with no indigestion or diarrhea. I've tried switching to cheaper brands, but they leave him gassy, listless, and constipated. My dog isn't crazy about the taste. Of course, he'd prefer canned or, even better, table scraps. But he does eat the Wellness, and it keeps him healthy.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: A sub-par version of store bought Wellness
review/text: We've been buying this exact formula of Wellness for our Cocker Spaniel "Lucy" for over a year now.  We thought that it would be worth purchasing on Amazon since it was priced almost identically and it would be more convenient than going to Petsmart since it would be delivered to our front door.  We didn't receive the food for well over a week after we ordered it so we were forced to buy a small bag at the store until we received the food.  No big deal...we figured next time we'll just order it a couple of weeks in advance so that Lucy's food supply isn't as low and we have plenty until we get the next bag.  After feeding her two meals of the bag we got from Amazon, Lucy started having violent diarrhea.  I'm familiar with the fact that changing foods can cause an upset stomach with dogs but this is the exact same food we have been feeding her for a very long time.....or so we thought.  We knew that the only thing that changed in Lucy's diet was the fact that we ordered the food from Amazon.  So we went and bought another small bag of the same stuff from Petsmart.  Much to our disappointment, there was an obvious difference in the appearance of the food.  The bag from Amazon had chunks that were misshaped, very porous and even smelled different.  Our conclusion was that Amazon received the reject bags at a discount and sold them as the same product.  We then stopped feeding Lucy the Amazon bag and switched her back to the store bought bag.  Immediately her bowls improved.  Although we were refunded for our purchase we had to jump through a few hoops that weren't worth the time we wasted to do so.  Please reconsider before you purchase this food.  Wellness is an Amazing product and we're proud to feed our little Lucy the best food that we possibly can but this is not up to the quality that Wellness is known for.  I'm going to post pics of both the Amazon bought food and the Store bought food so that you can see the difference.

review/summary: NOT a cure-all if that's what you're looking for
review/text: My dog has severe allergies as well as a sensitive stomach. After thousands of dollars, allergy shots, etc. I decided to give the fish and sweet potato a try because for years everyone has raved about how much better it is for dogs who are allergic to the typical proteins, etc. in kibble.  Well, let me say...I'm disappointed.  It's been six weeks and I've seen no difference in the itching/licking and scratching.  The fish breath? I can live with that but whoooooo-weeee the GAS that this stuff caused for not only my allergic dog but also my "stomach of steel" dog. They can clear the HOUSE in about two seconds flat.<br /><br />While I do appreciate the quality ingredients that are supposedly in this food, I am disappointed that I've seen absolutely no difference between this and the Pro Plan or Natural Balance I tried before this. Could it be just my dog, sure. But all in all, if you're looking for a magic cure, sorry to say this isn't the one it's hyped to be.

review/summary: Developed problems after couple weeks
review/text: I have had my German Shepherd on Canidae (chicken) since she was a puppy and did wonderful. Well, Canidae had a recall last winter & I had to switch her, so I tried Wellness (chicken).  I have to say, I am really disappointed with this dog food. Besides her not really liking it, her breathe smells bad, has very loose to diarrhea stools, and she has been licking her paws & shaking her head like her ears are bugging her ( which she never has done before and that is a sign of allergies). I noticed the chicken formula is back on the market and I will for sure be switching.

review/summary: Dog Food was excellent - but, don't count on it...
review/text: Our dog has many allergies, and - finally - we found a dog food that he can tolerate.  Happy Days!!  But, Wellness wasn't selling enough of the Salmon and Rice - so, they took if off the market.  No Warnings, no advice to begin to seek out an alternative - just, gone.  He is now vomiting on the Wellness replacement - and we're seeking yet another alternative - but, it won't be from this company.

review/text: I am very fond of Wellness brand itself, but this particular kind just did not get along with my dog's digestive system. I purchased at Petco store. My dog is a Sheltie and she has not had special dietary need that I know of. She was fine with other formulas/treats from Wellness.

review/summary: My Dog Wouldn't Touch this with a Ten Foot Pole!
review/text: My dog seems to be allergic to poultry so we thought we would switch him to this lamb-based formula.  Usually he is a good eater, but my dog had one smell of this stuff and wouldn't come back.  I understand Wellness puts higher-end ingredients in their food but if a dog doesn't like it there goes your money right down the drain.
