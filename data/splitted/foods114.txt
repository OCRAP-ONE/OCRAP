review/summary: ...Only because the coffee is so good
review/text: Love this coffee, so I was rather disappointed when I recieved this particular shipment.  The box said it was a pack of 50, but there were only 47 K-cups in the box.  And one of the K-cups had come open, reducing the quantity to 46 and creating a mess of coffee grounds in the box.  Not sure who takes the blame for this - the coffee box was sealed and included inside another box with other items, so that leads me to believe fault lies with "The Coffee People."  I suppose if many others are experiencing this same issue, it may be time to choose another coffee provider.<br /><br />March 29 Update: Discovered 8 other faulty cups in this batch - Top seal would come loose while brewing & cause grounds to overflow from top of K-cup, or the internal filter would leak by and puke coffee grounds into my cup.  I was beginning to suspect a faulty brewer,but when these same results occurred on a second and third brewer, the problem lies in the K-cup...

review/summary: Be Wary of These Pods
review/text: I ordered Emerils Big Easy Bold a few weeks ago, and at least half the time I have been dissatisfied, because there is something wrong with the pods.  The pods do not work well in the Keurig.  Instead of dripping down into the cup, they collect the water, flooding the dispenser and delivering only half a cup.  At first, I thought it was our Keurig, but the other coffee we have, the tea, and the hot chocolate work fine.  It's only Emerils that doesn't perform the way it should. It was ordered new from Amazon, but other Keurig products from Amazon are fine.

review/summary: well rounded & bold
review/text: I've tried many brands of extra bold K cup coffees and this one is the best. Well rounded and bold as the caption states. It has gotten slightly weaker over the years, but it is still good. Retail keeps going up here on Amazon as well as other outlets. However, Tully's and Newman's Own is currently much less expensive at the local Club store (C---co). The cost difference is forcing me to move to other retail and brand options. One item of note, the patent on the K Cup is expiring on Sept. 16, 2012. When Green Mountain Roasters is no longer the exclusive manufacturer of K Cups, we can all hope for a large decline in retail prices.

review/summary: good strong cup-o-joe
review/text: First, let me say, I do not consider myself to be a coffee connoisseur or snob. I do not have a refined pallet. But, I do enjoy a good strong cup of coffee. The Emerils bold is exactly what I was looking for. I know there are always those out there that say, "nowhere close to my custom grind and French press." But, I use the keurig for the convenience and variety. The emerils bold is perfect for what I want - a good strong cup of coffee to start off my work day.<br />***********<br />Update 7/26/12<br />I've tried a couple other "bold" coffee's, just to compare. (Brooklyn Beanery Fugettaboutit and Jet Fuel)  Not all bolds are the same. The other bolds seemed more bitter. (Some people think that bitter = strong coffee. Not true, strong coffee = good coffee, bitter coffee = bad coffee.) I'm done experimenting with different brands. For a good, strong cup of coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold will be my go to coffee from now on.<br /><br />Also, I just want to make one more comment on defective K-Cups. I see alot of reviews for both Emeril's and other K-Cups saying saying that they are horrible because 1 in every 3 explode in their Keurig machine. My wife and I go through 60 - 70 K-Cups per month, since December 2011. We've never had a problem with any of them. (when I say 60 - 70, they're not all Emeril's bold - we would be bouncing off the walls. We also use Caribou breakfast blend, decaf, green tea, heral tea, and hot cocoa.)

review/text: Received this order promptly, but am very disappointed in it.  Over half of the k cups have exploded in our Keurig.  When this happens it makes a huge mess.  The machine has to be totally cleaned each time.  It appears that the seal at the top of the kcups is not properly attached.  The ones that do survive make excellent tasting coffee, but I will not reorder them online again.  Very disappointed, makes some of the best tasting coffee we have tried, but only got to drink a little of it.

review/text: Very good but not great. Did not have the richness and depth of flavor desired.  We ordered this and the Green Mountain Double Black Diamond and between the two the Green Mountain was better.  We had no issues with the Emeril's as far as grounds in the coffee, etc.  The flavor is good but for a French Roast, it has not overcome that K-cup issue of 'weakening' the richness of bold coffees.

review/summary: Finally I've Found My Everyday K-Cup !
review/text: Bought a Keurig machine several months ago (which I love BTW!) and started out buying different variety packs of coffee's so I could try all kinds of new flavors and blends.  Eventually I wanted to decide upon something that would be my everyday standard.  In the mornings like a nice solid bold roast that's rich and doesn't get watered down when making a full cup out of the Keurig machine.<br /><br />Right away I knew the Emeril's was the best choice, the Easy Bold is perfect my morning Joe.  At night I go with a lighter blend (from Supermarket using the MyK-Cup) but Emeril's Easy Bold is perfect for my mornings.

review/summary: My Favorite K-Cup Coffee
review/text: I've had my Keurig coffee maker for over a year and have tried many different K-cups. Most recently, the new Dunkin' Donuts. HATED IT.  I couldn't wait to dump it out and brew one of my Emerils. Of course, with the Keurig brewer, I didn't have to wait long. YUM.  This coffee is for the real coffee drinker. It is strong (even on the large cup size setting), bold and full bodied, but smooth with no bitterness.  By far, my favorite. I order them through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program for the best price. Once in awhile from Bed, Bath and Beyond with a 20% coupon, but their prices have gone up substantially and I prefer the size (50 pack) from Amazon.

review/text: One of the best decisions I have made was to match my Keurig coffee maker with Emeril's Big Easy Bold K-Cups. Keurig makes sure each cup of coffee is hot, fresh and eliminates the odor of coffee siting in a pot for hours. Big Easy Bold is the best tasting coffee I have ever had. Bye Bye Starbucks - no need to run out when you need a coffee fix! The new packaging reduces waste, and with Amazon's subscription service I can always have inventory at home.

review/summary: Delicious but packaging is faulty
review/text: First of all I love the flavor.  Couldn't be happier, it is as described - bold, delicious, loved it.<br /><br />BUT I bought this several times and each time I had problems with my Keurig and the packaging.  The K cups would not empty, would overflow, and would make only 1/2 the amount recommended.  Keurig would say "prime" repeatedly after using these cups, and I would have to go through the extensive method of re-priming my Keurig.  I bought this twice, and (yes, I'm slow), with the second batch realized the problem was the packaging of the K cups.  For whatever reason this kept happening.<br /><br />Since I cannot return this item I am stuck with 30 of these that I won't use.<br /><br />I also won't order anything with the blue cups again, especially not this brand.<br /><br />Just to clarify - I am not a serially negative poster, and I have had my Keurig for over 6 months.  I've used multiple other brands without a problem.<br /><br />For now I'm sticking with Paul Newman's extra bold.  Great flavor and no problems with the K cups.

review/summary: A bit bitter
review/text: We love the big bold flavors we typically find in the dark roast coffees available for the Keurig.  However, my family and I found this one a bit too bitter.  The flavors are strong and this is definitely a bold coffee, but the lingering flavor was not as smooth as some of our more favorites.<br /><br />We've tried this on two occasions, once from a sample pack and another time from a box of 24.  We all consistently agreed across the two times.  So I feel pretty confident in our assessment.  Perhaps others will like this if they put more sugar or cream in it to knock a bit of the bitterness off.  Since I use no cream and only a little sweetener, this is just a bit too strong for us.

review/summary: Worth the problems
review/text: I have ordered about 20 boxes of this coffee.  Seems in 3-4 of the packs in each box of 50 clogs up and gives me issues on my machine.  For some reason it punctures the filter bag and grounds clog up everything.  I will normally tap the k-cup on the counter prior to insertion to try and get the filter away from the punture mechanism at the bottom but it still clogs at times.  I have a wire that I use to clean out the jet when it gets clogged.<br /><br />Outside of this issue the coffee is the best on the market if you like a good bold<br />cup of coffee.  I still highly recommend this product.  And..it is a great value.

review/summary: really bold taste - the best I have found
review/text: I have been grinding my own coffee and putting it into a DIY k-cup. I tried several of the "bold" pre-packaged k-cups (I use these when I am in a hurry.) None of them matched up to my own grind until I ran across these. Emeril's Big Easy Bold is the first I have found that make me want to brew them instead of my own grind. Excellent!

Nice for after dinner but not a real waker upper

review/text: It appears that the coffee is not very consistent with the flavor. My first experience with this coffee was a good one, smooth rich flavor. This box is so bitter that neither myself or my wife will drink it.<br /><br />I tried the coffee again this morning, just bad, very bitter. I normally like most coffees, this one is exceptionally bad. I must have received a bad batch, it seems that the batches are very inconsistent. I tried to send my coffee back to Amazon, no return policy fo coffee.

review/summary: awesome brownies - pancake mix is really good too!
review/text: i have tried 3 pamela's products:  the brownie mix, the pancake mix and the bread mix.  first the brownies -- best i've ever tasted - i'm addicted to these things!  i tried doing the applesauce substituted for oil and i don't recommend that - the brownies were too dry.  the oil recipe is definitely the best -- also substituting espresso for water was yummy -- the pancake mix is really good too.  i've made the pancakes and the waffles - the waffles are the best i've ever tasted, with or without gluten.  my co-worker used the pancake mix as a substitute in a regular recipe that called for all-purpose flour and said it worked great.  finally, the bread - my friend made me a loaf of bread in her bread machine and it was pretty good --not dry like most gluten-free products.  the only thing was that when i tried to toast it, the bread remains moist - it won't toast!  weird...anyway, i recommend all three products and buying them off amazon will save you $1.50 - $2.00 off the package price at the supermarket!

review/text: I recently was diagnosed with Celiac, and tried these brownies. I LOVE THEM! They have a bit of a gritty texture as compared to regular brownies, and they are SUPER chocolatey. It is the most intense chocolate flavor I've ever had in a brownie. But I like that kind of thing, so I love 'em! Plus, they don't have a ton of fat and they have fewer calories than non-GF brownies, and because they are so chocolatey, they satisfy me quicker than what I remember with non-GF brownies. The ingredients are all organic too, which is nice.<br /><br />Highly recommended. :)

review/summary: Brownie mix -- Nothing to write home about
review/text: I tried Pamela's Brownie Mix on the recommendation of a relative with celiac, about a year after I was diagnosed.  I was pretty disappointed; although moist with a very brownie-like texture, there is an aftertaste I didn't like that I notice in many GF baking mixes.  Also I agree with the comment about them tasting carob-y instead of chocolatey.  My non-GF family & friends said they were "weird" and "different".  Not terrible, but after I tasted one, I did not want another.  I'm sticking with the flourless brownie recipe I've been using; at least my family likes them.

review/summary: Suprisingly GOOD
review/text: I initially purchased a package of this brownie mix from Walmart; it was on clearance. For years, I had no idea why I was always sick. One of the outstanding food problems was chocolate. Consequently, I did not eat it. I was not sad, but every now and again I would want to have a bite of it. It couldn't be too chocolately; it had to be more on the lines of a milk chocolate flavor. Anyway, I made these brownies tonight. Since I like cake-like brownies (not such a concentrated chocolate flavor), I made some changes. I did not use the recipe on the package. In place of the listed 1/2 cup of water, I used 1/2 cup of milk. I also added 1/4 cup of water. I like cooked pecans, so I added slightly chopped pecans in the batter and some whole pecans on top. The result was really good brownies. I like the melted chunks of chocolate in brownies. My brownies were no where close to gritty. This may be due to the fact that I used milk (lactose-free) in place of the main water ingredient. Will buy again and use for events. It won't even be necessary to tell others it is gluten free until AFTER they've said how good they are. (smile)

review/text: I've had some gluten free foods that were terrible, but this is not one of them! These are amazing. My 8 y/o daughter has recently been put on a gluten free diet by her doctor for gluten intolerance (testing for Celiac also) and she was upset that she couldn't have "anything worth eating" anymore. I made her these brownies, and she said they were better than my recipe (which was a wheat based brownie)! Along with food intolerances she has high-functioning autism so she is very picky about textures, gritty food bothers her. I noticed a tiny texture difference from the wheat brownies but she gobbled them up anyway, they were THAT good. I made the "original" style, and it came out moist, soft, and just gooey enough but not undercooked. I like them better than wheat brownies, because you can cut these while they're still somewhat hot and they don't crumble! Getting them out of the pan hot is a trick but I only broke one brownie doing it. Even my husband, who can have all the gluten he likes, loved them.

A nice fresh loaf of bread happens to be number one, but a close second is a wonderful pan of moist brownies.  The sad thing is that many gluten-free mixes end up with products that are coarse and dry...and, believe me, I've tried many.<br /><br />This one, however, is fabulous.  You'd never know it was gluten free.  In fact, if you make it for people who aren't going gluten free, they'll never know.  But why do that?  They can have their regular old brownies and you can have these...all for yourself.<br /><br />Easy to make.  Moist.  Nice texture.  They don't even need frosting.  Just sprinkle some powdered sugar on top if you like (if you sprinkle it through a doily it will make a pattern for fancy events).  I've also added nuts to this mix, such as almonds, walnuts, and even brazil nuts.<br /><br />Simply heaven.

review/text: Superb! These are amazingly good. I'd eat them even if I could eat regular wheat flour based brownies. The egg free option is superb too which is also important to me.

review/summary: How many delicious versions can you make from one brownie mix?
review/text: Several decadent ones. And all the recipes are on each bag. Rave reviews from all my non-celiac friends. Excellent case price from Amazon versus any store (Whole Foods/Sprouts/Market Street/Central Market) where I can purchase in North Central Texas. An also outstanding alternative (if you want less decadent, more cake like, but also like the "real thing") is the Namaste Chocolate or Namaste Blonde Brownie mixes, both available by the case at a great price from Amazon. Everything Pamela's and everything Namaste I have tried have been excellent, this coming from someone who used to bake from scratch.

review/text: I order these on a yearly basis for my gluten-intolerant girlfriend.<br /><br />Pros:<br />She loves these, which can be tough to do because she still remembers her pre-gluten-free days<br />They are easy to make (although she has me make them most of the time because I never over mix them, her's always have a cake consistency)<br />Well priced on Amazon, unlike in most stores<br /><br />The girlfriend is so impressed with Pamela's products, she has subscribed to the monthly newsletter and received countless recipes we love (e.g., gluten-free crepes).

review/text: I bought these in our supermarket on a whim one day.  I love them.  I have had digestive issues since childhood.  These taste great.  They dont make me feel sick.  I can have my cookie fix without feeling compelled to eat all of them.  My supermarket stopped carrying them so I bought the six pack.  I make them about once a month so the mixes will be used long before they expire.

review/summary: Fabulous!
review/text: Note, the back of the package gives you options as to what you can add to the mix.  There is a cake-like optin, fudgy, non-oil, etc...  I used the "fudgy" recipe and it was FABULOUS!  They had a wonderful flavor.  I got them on a whim, suspecting one of my children may have a problem with gluten.  Even if he tests ok, I will buy these again, I actually prefer in some ways to the Duncan Hines brand I normally use.  My son has eaten them up!  We do not notice any aftertaste (which has been mentioned in other reviews).  Maybe they used a different recipe than fudgy?  I actually did notice the chocolate had a very rich taste, like they used a high quality coco powder.

review/summary: Pricey, but yummy
review/text: While this mix is pretty pricey to end up with a small pan of brownies, they do have a great taste!  I love that they have alternative recipes on the package.  We have egg allergies, so I use the egg-free recipe.  I have to cook it for significantly longer than the recipe states, (10+ mins.), and still the brownies are pretty gooey and don't hold together.  OK to eat at home, but not good enough to take anywhere.  Again, they taste great, especially for a chocolate and sweets deprived pregnant woman :)

review/summary: Birthday Cake Savior for GFCF + Egg, peanut and tree nut free household!
review/text: With a birthday fast approaching I was searching everywhere for a decent GFCF and egg, peanut and tree nut free cake recipe or mix.  I've tried several different recipes from several different cookbooks and websites in the past, but never felt compelled to recreate those disappointing cake moments.  I checked out Pamela's website and found an egg and dairy free cake recipe using the brownie mix.  I'd seen Pamela's products at my local grocery store, but stayed away because of the steep price ($7 for a single bag of the brownie mix!).  Then I found the product on Amazon and saw the subscribe and save price and the positive reviews, and that made me decide to take the plunge.<br /><br />I tried out the egg and dairy free recipe and not only did all the kids enjoy it, but so did the adults, some even had seconds.  The cake does taste and almost feels like brownie, but it tastes good and the texture is not off-putting.  After 2 years of disappointing birthday cake for my 3 kids, I've finally found a tasty and economical solution.  Thanks Pamela's Products!

review/summary: It's delicious. Inbetween cake and bread
review/text: I love this gluten free bread. Very easy to make....<br />a quick tip. After mixing and putting in bread pan, leave it<br />in a 200 degree oven for an hour and then bake it for another hour at 350. It gets a crispy crust but stays soft and firm on the inside. Try sprinkling a little raw sugar on the top before putting in oven. The only problem with this bread is that I overeat it.

review/text: This product is great for not only brownies but also cake. I used the recipe on the side for decadent cake and everyone loved it. People didn't know it was gluten/casein free at all. Was flavorful and moist. I ran out of vanilla almond milk so I used chocolate almond milk. It made it more chocolatey.<br />For a gluten/casein free chocoholic it was a wonderful treat.

review/text: Truly, I adore these brownies.  I am always reluctant to use mixes for anything but an extra crazy schedule forced me to grab this at the store, and boy howdy am I glad!  I made the butter version and added an extra Tablespoon of oil for extra moisture.  You know those flourless chocolate cakes that are so yummy?  That's what these remind me of.  I will be buying this again and again, and was so impressed that now I'm embarking on other Pamela products.

review/summary: Wonderful for children who are gluten free and casein free
review/text: My son has autism and is on the GFCF diet.  He loves this mix made into cookies.  I remove the chocolate chunks ( trying to keep them as low in sugar as possible)  and I add 8 tspns benefiber and 1/4 cup baby rice cereal to boost the nutrition.  Then I add 1/4 cup flax oil and 1/4 cup olive oil and bake on a pizza stone - they never burn on the pizza stone - might burn if cooked on conventional bakeware.  My son love these and he is a very very picky eater.  The brownies that this mix makes are fabulous, too.  Great for birthday parties.

I like it better than Bob's Red Mill brownie mix (which I thought was good too, but a bit moist). It tastes just like "regular" brownie mix. No complaints, everyone loves it, and my daughter doesn't have a tummy ache. Perfect!

review/text: I cannot say enough about Pamela's brands, especially the Brownie Mix.  They are just as good, if not better, than many conventional mixes out there.  And Pamela's gives many variations to the recipes on their packaging - although I highly recommend the "Fudgiest Brownies".  I bought a case for my sister who also went wheat-free and she agrees.  If you've found out you must have a wheat-free diet and feel that loss, try these products!

review/summary: easy, tasty brownie mix
review/text: This is good stuff, of which I have consumed an absurd amount. I keep some of these brownies in the freezer at all times, for serving guests, or for having a little something sweet myself when I come home from an event where everyone but me (all the non-celiacs) have been snarfing down the cake or cookies and I have had . . . coffee.<br /><br />The first time I used this mix, I made the butter recipe, because I had always cooked with butter and was afraid it wouldn't taste good without butter. But the next time, I was in a hurry and didn't want to bother melting butter, so I made the oil version with canola oil, and it tasted just as good. And it's better for you. So that's what I make. I usually add half a cup of Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips. The flavor of the dough has a subtle richness that I think comes from being sweetened mostly with mollasses and honey. As with all brownies, don't over cook.<br /><br />I often make this to take to potlucks or other events that require "something to share," because it's easy and quick and everyone who likes chocolate likes these brownies. They are very moist and rich; I cut them into very small squares. Unfortunately, they taste great right out of the freezer; otherwise they would last longer and I would weigh less.

I've made them for dessert and no one guesses that they're gluten-free.  We make the "fudgy" version and it really is just too good for words.  Nice chocolate chunks, also!<br />Another great value with Amazon's "subscribe & save".  This product is approaching $5 per bag at the foodstore.  Now, we can have brownies as much as we want!

review/summary: FANTASTIC BROWNIE MIX!!
review/text: My son was just diagnosed with allergies to several different grains.  I've been trying all kinds of products to pack in his lunches because of it.  I decided to try Pamela's wheat free, gluten free chocolate brownie mix.  He LOVED it.  He almost ate the whole pan in one day!  My husband, is SUPER picky about "health" foods and though the texture is somewhat different than white, bleached, enriched, yucchhh flour, he and my boy were fighting over the last pieces.  It is a little crumblier, but we all liked it.  Thank you Pamela's.  It's nice to find some alternatives out there;  the fact that they are healthier is just an added PLUS!!

I will definitely be looking for something else.
