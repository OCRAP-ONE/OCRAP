review/text: When the Raisin Bran came out in the Fiber One brand, I couldn't find my Honey Clusters at grocery, Walmart, or Target stores. I spent lots of time looking; when, I decided to check Amazon.com.  I found what I needed at a better price (and delivered to my door).  Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: Tastes HORRIBLE, even for a fiber cereal!
review/text: I happen to like most of the Fiber One cereals, but this version is AWFUL.  It has the same stiff, round flakes, but they've been coated with some kind of fake, metallic sweetener.  It's overpowering, and it literally made me sick.  If you need the fiber, I recommend Fiber One's raisin bran.  It's more naturally flavored and the raisins make it just sweet enough.  Stay away from the Honey Clusters!

review/summary: Better than expected
review/text: I am not going to say that fibre products are as good as lobster, but the cereal was much bettr than I expected. Lets talk about cost, as fiber one is costly. If you need fiber, since most of us get less than half of daily requirements, and adds to alot of nasty illnesses, colon cancer, we need fiber. To to get fiber needed out of regular food items, its almost impossible. This cereal, provides about half whats needed. Whew, love that fiber. So, it provides much more good fiber and grams and so the cost is in a way less than others, that have much less fiber, and therefore is actually more expensive. Happy crunching.

review/summary: Horrible aftertaste
review/text: I made the mistake of eating this cereal before reading the ingredient label.  You would think with Sugar, Corn Syrup, Brown Sugar, Honey, Barley Malt Extract, and Malt Syrup it would be sweet enough.  But no, they also added Sucralose, which explains the gross aftertaste.  If you dislike artificial sweeteners, skip this cereal.  I prefer getting fiber from cereals with short lists of ingredients, with mostly things I actually can identify.

review/text: One might think that the sugar, corn syrup, and high fructose corn syrup in this cereal would be enough. Lurking in the list of ingredients is the poisonous Sucralose. Another Fiber One cereal has Aspertame. At least now I know I have to read every label.

review/text: I have enjoyed sugar twin since my mother first sent it to me in a care package while I was stationed in germany back in 1974 due to my weight and the military rules on weight control, it helped ne to maintain a level of weight that was acceptable to the miltary.  I love it and have to order as no commercial or military facility in the area of the U.S. that I live in has it available.

review/summary: My Favorite Tea!
review/text: This has been my favorite tea for a number of years. I love it hot or cold, but most of the time I drink it cold. When making it by the glass I take a tall iced tea glass, fill it with very cold spring water and add 2 Raspberry Zinger tea bags. In a couple of minutes I have iced raspberry tea! I drink it unsweetened sometimes but other times I add a little bit of liquid stevia (a natural sweetener found in health food stores that does not have any calories & does not affect your blood sugar) and it is delicious. I sometimes add some fresh squeezed lemon or lime juice. Sometimes I add 6-8 tea bags to a gallon of spring water and make the tea in the fridge. I love to bring a gallon of it to the homes of friends and family when we visit. My sister-in-law recently asked me what brand of tea it was because they had made some iced raspberry herbal tea and it did not taste good like the one I make. I told her it was Celestial Seasons Raspberry Zinger. You can make any flavor of their teas iced by just adding the tea bags to cold water. My husband likes it also! I love it hot too. Everyone has their own tastes, but everyone that I give it to iced thinks it tastes really good.<br />I have even used it to dye some doll's clothes for an antiqie doll some years ago. Teas can be used as a natural dye source.

I don't put sugar or anything in it. Also, when brewed, it's a deep raspberry pink color and smells wonderful! I would highly recommend this if you enjoy fruit and/or berry herbal teas!

review/summary: With Zinger Ice Tea Summer Never Has To Be Over!
review/text: I know it is October and summer is officially over but this tea is good year round. Now it is sweetened with stevia but I think it is not quite sweet enough so I add another packet of stevia. The main flavors in this tea are hibiscus and raspberry. I don't taste much of the roasted chicory or orange peel. This also has blackberry leaves and rasberry leaves but you'd never know it. This is caffeine free and considered an herbal tea so you can drink it day or night. All you do is steep two bags and then pour the tea over ice. Add more sweetener if needed.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: While some may like the sweet cloying taste of raspberry tea, and I've tried it, what I like most about this version of raspberry tea is that it's tangy and sour. I add a packet of Splenda to my morning Raspberry Red Zinger tea and the combination is just right:  not too sour and not too sweet in other words perfect.<br /><br />What I also love about this tea is doesn't contain caffeine meaning I can cut back on the caffeine I've been drinking. I love black tea both iced or hot so it's nice to have a tasty alternative as I can drink the Raspberry Zinger tea instead.<br /><br />Recommend.

Of course, most of us know that already!<br /><br />If you're in the mood for something warming with just a hint of sweetness and lots of flavor, this tea is for you.

review/text: So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the teas in the "zinger" series.  I like Celestial Seasonings in general.  Of course, the tea bags have no strings and that is something of an annoyance, but other than that, the teas are tasty and enjoyable.  Zinger really is a great description of the product.  It has a surprising and deeply flavorful taste and an aroma to match.  The lemon has a fresh, rich lemon flavor.  The raspberry embodies the flavor of raspberry as well.  It is a great option for those who enjoy herbal teas.

review/text: When I first brewed the tea bag, I was amazed by the deep red color and invigorating fragrance. The tea was very sweet and I didn't need to add sugar or milk. After taking a few sips however, and relatively enjoying the rasperry taste, the flavors began to become sickeningly sweet--a bit too fruity. There isn't very much "tea" flavor here-mostly just fruit flavor. It's worth a try, and I believe that a more experienced tea drinker would appreciate this unique blend.

Then he spent the next couple days throwing up chunks of bone. My boxer is not an aggressive chewer but this bone is soft and can easily be broken down...no "hours of enjoyment for your pet." I normally watch closer when he's chewing something that he can break up but I thought I had nothing to fear with the bone.<br /><br />I wish the packaging had been clearer about the nature of the bone.  However, I am am glad it is made in the US.<br />In the meantime I'll stick to good ol' soup bones and antlers for him to gnaw on and I'll pay closer attention as he chews on something new.

review/summary: Not all that good
review/text: While saving money is a key factor in purchasing this, I am basing my review on the taste of the product.  Overall, the coffee has a powdery taste as compared to the pre-packaged K-cups. It does not compare to the Tully Pre-Packaged French Roast that I am used to drinking.<br /><br />As noted by other reviewers, I don't know the Eco friendliness of the packaging, since you are trading out a small plastic cup for a small plastic pouch.<br /><br />Overall, a two star for the taste.

review/summary: The strongest of the Ekojava varieties -
review/text: My wife likes the French Roast, Honduran House Blend, West Coast Roast, Breakfast Blend, Sumatran, and then Donut Cafe in that order.  I prefer the Donut Cafe, Sumatran, French Roast, Breakfast Blend, West Coast, then Honduran.  They each have subtle differences and are a good alternative to more expensive Green Mountain (K-cups) varieties.  These tend to work better with the My K Cup (reusable filter) than Folgers or other regular coffees due to the finer grind and package size.  I paid $3.82 per 25 count container on my last order before the price went back up to $11.99 and would pay that again.  I don't think I would pay regular price however.

review/text: I got these when I bought the Eco Brew cups so I could reach my free shipping limit. I was not expecting much but I was very surprised. Easy to tear open pack and the fill the cup to the proper level of a big cup of coffee. These are not super bold but I find they are more of a medium bold which is just right for me. I plan on ordering more as soon as I run oyt.

review/summary: Good coffee & value ... MY Kcup not so good
review/text: I love the idea of less garbage and lower cost for Kcup coffee, but I find the water just passes through MY Kcup too fast, so it is hard to get a really strong brew which is what I prefer. The EcoJava is a great coffee just do not like the results in the kcup machine.

review/summary: Good flavor, great value
review/text: I decided to try this coffee on a whim after browsing by it on Amazon. I have a Keurig single-cup brewer and have been looking for a less expensive and more environmentally friendly product than the overpriced k-cups....without giving up the flavor and quality that I like about them. The EkoJava packets fit the bill pretty well. I use them in my reusable Solofill k-cup. Each packet is just the right amount for the Solofill. I deducted 1 star because the flavor isn't quite as robust as with the actual k-cups varieties that I like, but I brew these on a smaller setting (less water) which provides more flavor in each cup. Also, it's important that you do not pack the coffee into the reusable cup too tightly or it will not brew the full amount of coffee. The grounds must have room to expand and allow the water to flow through, so you must leave the grounds as loose as possible for best results with this product! Another good thing about these packets is that the plastic pouch can be fully recycled, where as k-cups are extremely wasteful. For that reason alone, this product is worth a try, but hte flavor is great too!

review/summary: it's OK
review/text: We decided to try these because they were on sale at a very low price. Though many reviews are positive, we weren't all that thrilled with them. It seems there is even just a bit too much in each packet for filling the holder. They aren't as convenient as some of the other reviewers might lead you to believe, and there is some stuff to throw away as well. The container they come in is quite large, so we ended up throwing them into a baggie. The flavor was pretty decent, but using them is really not all that different from using any other ground coffee.

review/text: I bought these to try because they were so cheap and seemed like a good idea to reuse the poems cup. The coffee rates good and it works great though admittedly more work then a one use K cup. That is mainly personal thing since it is for an up stairs second coffee put that is not near a sink so I can't simply wash it out. Otherwise they are pretty handy....though I do wonder if I am being eco after all being that I am still making trash.

The coffee does not taste freshly ground and tastes like is is old and has lost all of its flavor.  No matter what the price, bad coffee is no bargain.  Oh well...will have to stick to the more expensie Black Diamond K-cups.

I insert a 4-cup paper filter into the pod well, pour in one of the packets, fold the filter closed, and moments later I have a great tasting mug of coffee.<br />Coffee taste is a matter of personal preference. For my taste, the EkoJava French Roast is perfect.

review/summary: Great French Roast, less than mediocre packaging.
review/text: The coffee is good. On par with most other French Roast pre-ground coffees.  Smooth flavor, and the aroma is mouthwatering.  The coffee itself is 4.5 stars out of 5.<br /><br />These are marketed along with the EkoBrew K-Cup replacement, which is how I have been using them. The thing is - these "single serve packets" don't fit into the Ekobrew K-cup - there is too much coffee. There is no practical way to "save" the remaining grounds for use another time/day. I don't drink the same flavor every day, so it would be a few days before I rotate back to this flavor, and then I'd have to open another package to even out the amount - leaving me with another partial package. Unpractical to say the least. I bought this to save time and flavor (after exposure to air, the flavor becomes less potent.) and I'm not really saving either. I spend more time trying to tap out the proper amount of grinds to fit into the EcoBrew, and then the package is open, so the leftovers aren't as rich as the first brew.  Package review would be 2 stars out of 5 - the functionality of it is there, but the sizing needs a major improvement to be practical for what it's marketed as.<br /><br />In summary: Taste is great, Package size leaves a lot to be desired. 3.5/5 (rounded to 4)

review/summary: Bakery on Main Granolas rock!
review/text: Our family has tried several of Bakery on Main's granolas - and this flavor is one of our favorites.  We don't all need to eat GF foods, but if we find something that tastes good, my family will go along with my GF lifestyle and enjoy it, too.  This is one of those foods that we all eat because it tastes great, stays crunchy with milk on it, and is good for you.  I love having the flaxseed in the granolas since it shows Bakery on Main's desire to add the "healthier" ingredients to their products.  Give it a try and I'm sure you'll love it, too!

review/text: Be VERY careful when eating this cereal. There are tiny dried fruit pieces in the cereal which are so incredibly hard, their consistency is something akin to an uncooked grain of rice. This morning I was eating a bowl, and one of the fruit pieces became lodged between a tooth and my gums while chewing. I unfortunately now have an open, bleeding wound in my mouth thanks to this cereal. So please, be very, very careful while eating this. I never thought I would actually ever have to say that about A BREAKFAST CEREAL!

(also good for vegetarians who need protein, since they are a bean) I've had fresh or frozen edamame and enjoyed them so I thought I'd try these. They are very tasty; they have a good, subtle flavor, a little nutty. They are slightly dry, but no more than say an average cracker or something like that. I will definitely add them to my lunch rotation :) I also like that the food is not very processed, with only three ingredients (soybeans, maltodrextrin, sea salt). I love that I found them on Amazon, since they don't have them in my regular grocery story so the convenience is a major plus!

review/text: As I continued to take my acai shots in the morning and evening, I noticed a new but familiar desire in myself. I finally wanted to exercise again!! To my delight after my second full 32.0z bottle of acai gold. I am up in the mornings walking on my treadmill. Mind you this has not happened in almost 15yrs!! I was a regular exercise junkie back then but over the years poor eating habits and lack of exercise has left me listless and depressed. A friend recommended I try acai berry for weight loss but it has been soo much more than that!! I tried the organic vs. conventional because I wanted to get as close to natural as I could.I found this product to be a bit watery and murky looking, but from what I read the apperance is the way it is suppose to be. The seeds are apparent when you drink it and the taste is a cross between berry and chocolate. Overall not bad and I feel it does work over a period of time, might I add like anything worth having, you have to wait for it!!!

review/summary: Accelerated my metabolism
review/text: I have been drinking Acai Gold for about two months and here is what I have noticed. My energy level went up a great deal in the beginning. Followed by a lack of appetite. Then I began to notice that I was losing weight since I wasn't eating as much.<br /><br />After two months, my hair is really healthy and shiny. Since I gave birth to my second child, my hair and skin have not looked this vibrant in some time. I was warned that acai juice doesn't taste very good but I actually like the taste of this juice. Just make sure to shake it before you pour so the seeds are not all settled at the bottom.<br /><br />I like ordering it by the case since my husband has now joined me in my ritual of taking acai shots. Dynamic Health was professional and prompt in fulfilling my order. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the results that I hoped to achieve by consuming acai.

review/summary: Acai Gold: Increased energy, decreased weight
review/text: Aug 2012 - I used Dynamic Health's Acai Gold as a last resort, because nothing else seemed to touch the extra weight I'd been carrying for years. Lo and behold! My appetite not only decreased, I seemed to have less craving for sugar. And I felt more energetic. Not miraculously so, but I have chronic fatigue, so any increase in energy is worth noting. I lost 12 lbs in under 2 weeks. Someone said I was probably just losing water weight. I replied that I didn't care how I lost the weight; I hadn't been able to lose any weight for several years, and was just happy to weigh less. I maintained the weight loss for several months, but didn't lose any more, so I decided to stop taking Acai Gold.  Over the next few months, I regained 10 lbs., so I'm placing another order, today. Good stuff!<br /><br />Sep 2012 - I've been taking 1-2 ozs of Acai Gold again for the past few weeks, and have lost 7 lbs.! And that's in spite of my forgetting to take it for almost a week after someone pushed it to the back of the fridge, so I didn't get the visual reminder to take it every day. Again I notice that my appetite and cravings for sugar have decreased. Again I feel a little more alert and energetic and have less muscle pain and spasms than I typically have from fibromyalgia. Definitely good stuff!

review/text: This is probably some of the purest form of acai out on the  market.  It is organic and completely pure.  The delivery was prompt and the seller was professional.  The only reason I don't give it a five-star rating is that for some reason acai juice in general seems to make me go into depression.  I have a very sensitive system so it probably won't be a common side-effect for most people,  but I do want others to know that it is a possibility.  Acai is full of nutrition and benefits, but I had to stop drinking it because it caused depression in me.

My husband and I are trying valiantly to get through a bottle of this "juice", but it isn't anything like the acai berry juice we've purchased elsewhere. The other tasted like boysenberry; this tastes "just not good". Which is why it's probably better for us. But there's no sense in our buying it if we're not going to drink it, so this is our first and last bottle.

review/summary: Won the approval of my very finicky cats!
review/text: I have an 8 year old and a 2 year old. They are both very finicky and get bored with food easily. If they don't like a food, they just lick up the gravy and the rest dries out, so the leftovers go outside for the feral cats. I'm always on the search for new things to let them try. Now that one of my cats is getting older, I'm getting proactive about his urinary tract health so I was happy to find the variety of Friskies Senior cannned cat food here on Amazon. This flavor is their favorite, they lick their plate clean. It has chunks that are small enough for my older cat to eat (he has some missing teeth, I took him in as a stray) and plenty of gravy which both of them love. I like that when I open the can it smells like real meat instead of stinky mystery meat by products. This food ( any flavor) is a great deal on this site. Friskies runs about 50 cents a can when it's on sale at the grocery store, and with Super Saver Shipping I come out almost equal and don't have to wait for sales to stock up. There are also so many flavors available here that aren't in stores. My furry friends are happy, so I'm happy.

review/summary: The Cats' Meow
review/text: My four cats really, really like Friskies Cat Food Meaty Bits Senior Diet with Lamb & Rice in Gravy.  I add a little warm water which makes even more gravy and then mix in a small amount of dry food.  My cats are very impatient that I'm not faster at feeding them.  It doesn't matter to them that there is a pop tab on the can so I open it quickly.  In their opinion, I simply don't put the plates down fast enough.  I think they were watching episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation where Data gives a command to the unit in his quarters and a mere second or two later, a bowl of food appears for his cat Spot.  I appreciate that Friskies Lamb & Rice comes in a senior formula as three of my cats are seniors and this formula is easy for them to digest.

review/summary: Great alternative for my male
review/text: Although this isn't his absolute favorite, I always have a few cans on hand to toss into the mix whenever my male gets tired of his regular routine. If you've EVER had a Persian (and PLEASE, feel sorry for me because I have TWO), you KNOW they're the most finicky of all cats.  But, every male I've ever had has gone crazy over this lamb variety.  It's just something very different, something they just don't make in every brand, so it's quite nice to have the change.  It has bits of rice in it which, although my guy thinks it's VERY unmanly, he does eat it clean.  I do recommend this variety, even though it's diet, he's had it since he was a year old.  Great stuff, highly recommend!

review/summary: Just not good cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are water sufficient for processing, meat by-products, chicken, turkey, and wheat gluten. At least there is chicken and turkey in it, which is the only reason it got more than 1 star from me. But other than that its all nasty stuff. Wheat Gluten is just gross and by-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Other Friskies flavors are even worse than this one. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.

review/summary: Totally surprised and delighted!
review/text: When blended teas became available a few years ago I jumped to try as many as I could. The fun wore off when most of the blends I tried were too unbalanced or too simple for the ingredients to really get synergy. I then went for blends only as medicinal support.<br /><br />This Cucumber White blend really scared me (vegetables and white tea??) but I tried it on the insistence of a friend. I was floored by how round and full of flavor this blend is. This tea manages to come across as calmly invigorating and robustly refreshing. The cucumber is a subtle, fresh note atop the more earthy white tea base. I can taste the tiniest hint of lime, too.<br /><br />All-in-all it's a playful, grown-up blend that gives just enough caffeine to perk me up. It's low enough in caffeine that I can drink it a couple hours after my morning coffee and it doesn't make me feel caffeinated at all.<br /><br />I think this would be a great iced tea, too. If I had a spa/salon/wellness center I would serve this tea!<br /><br />Even if the idea of Cucumber White tea puts you off, try it. I think you'll be as surprised as I was.

review/text: This pasta sauce has organic ingredients, no added sodium and tastes great.  Also, its glass jar packaging avoids potentially dangerous chemical leaching that can occur with canned tomato sauce.  Finding a reasonably priced, organic, no sodium tomato sauce in a jar is difficult.  I eat it daily because research has shown that the anti-oxidant lycopene in tomatoes (particularly cooked tomatoes as in sauce) is extremely beneficial for prostate health, especially when eaten with olive oil.  For these reasons, I recommend this product.
