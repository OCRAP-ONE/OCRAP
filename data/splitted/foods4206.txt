review/summary: GREAT TREATS
review/text: I try to stick to all natural products in my household.  That goes double for my dog.  she is a super mutt with a strong stomach, but that doesn't mean I want to take any chances.  these seem like quality treats and she really enjoys them. I have purchased several flavors and she loves them all.  will definitely buy them again.

review/text: We have two cats and four dogs. The cats seemed to like this treat but the dogs turned up their noses at it. One of them, a Chiweenee, eats just about everything and he would not touch it. He tried it and left it laying on the floor.

review/text: My 4 month old puppy loves these, and has even learned how to "go to bed" in order to get his paws on one! Zuke's is quite a consistent brand, and our pup loves everything we have bought by this company so far. My husband and I like knowing we're giving him a tasty treat that's also natural and is made in America. Amazon usually has these for a little bit cheaper than most of the pet stores in our area, which is also nice!

review/text: Buster is a recovering shelter dog, and a little picky in his eating sometimes. I've tried a lot of food/treats, and some things he won't eat at all or is allergic to. (Note: he has no problems with steak that I've seen, lol)<br /><br />The Zuke's line of products are now his favorites; I've tried several items in the Zuke's line, and he loves all of them. The Jerky Naturals Lamb has a strong smell, (thus a strong flavor too, I guess) and he really goes for that.<br /><br />USA made too, so all in all, highly recommended!

review/summary: Not Really "Jerky"
review/text: It's difficult to tell from the pictures and the description, but these aren't really jerky (dried strips of meat) but are smallish, moist, chewy treats made from meat and other ingredients - I suppose meat goop formed into a shape.  Think Pringle vs. a potato chip.  Anyway, our dog seems to approve - not sure it even touched the sides!  The beef, lamb and salmon varieties she tried all disappear in the blink of an eye.  A tasty treat for your dog, made in the USA, but just not the jerky I was hoping for.

review/summary: Just when I thought it couldn't get better than Caribou's signature blend, along comes Daybreak!
review/text: When I picked up a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, I really thought I'd found the best good-cuppa-coffee to please everyone in our household. Caribou is a coffee company that is very popular in Chicago and are known for producing great quality coffee. With their reputation, I've always been eager to try the other blends that are available in k cup form, but they are often hard to come by.<br /><br />I ordered a 5 k cup sampler size of this blend directly for Keurig because I was so happy with the Caribou Blend that I couldn't wait to try the company's other offerings. I'm so thankful I did, because the Daybreak Morning Blend just hit the original blend out the park!<br /><br />I enjoy a medium roast with a kick. Just because I don't like a dark, bitter cup of coffee doesn't mean I want to skimp on flavor or aroma. And Caribou Daybreak really delivers in both of those departments. This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop. It goes great with a little skim milk, too. A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us. So we have to order it online, which seems a little pricier (surprisingly). Oh well, I still think this blend is completely worth it. It's my new go-to k cup!

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill Whole Wheat Flour
review/text: "We use and believe in stone milling because no machinery has yet been developed that grinds grains into flours, cereals, and meals quite as well as the flint-hard quartz stones used by master millers since early Roman times." ~Bob's Red Mill Site<br /><br />The 100 % Stone Ground Whole Wheat Flour is my favorite flour for use in a variety of whole wheat bread recipes. It is all natural and doesn't contain any preservatives. You can use this flour for bread machine baking too and it produces superior results. I've used the recipe on the back of the bag and adapted it by using a mixture of whole wheat and regular bread flour because I didn't have any "gluten" as called for in the recipe. If you substitute 1 � cups of regular bread flour for part of the whole wheat flour you don't seem to need the gluten.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill products remind me of my childhood when my father took me to the Graue Mill in Oakbrook, IL where we watched corn being milled. It is now the only operating waterwheel gristmill in Illinois. While Bob's Red Mill products don't arrive in a cloth bag, the paper bags do have an old fashioned feel and have a string-sewn closure. I love the crinkly sound of the high-quality paper bags.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill uses slow turning, 100-year-old millstones to naturally grind together the bran, endosperm and germ that contains the nutritious oil. This is a "cool stone grinding process" which preserves nutrients normally lost in high-speed, high-heat milling.<br /><br />This company produces more than 400 products. Look for everything from hot cereals and mixes to flour milled from a wide variety of grains. If you love making natural breads in your bread machine, the flours are superior and produce deliciously nutritious breads.<br /><br />Whole Wheat Oat Rolls<br /><br />1 c. water, warmed to 110�F<br />5 T. fat-free milk powder<br />2 T. clover honey<br />2 T. salted butter, melted<br />2 1/2 tsp. active dry yeast<br />1 lg. egg<br />2 c. bread flour<br />1 c. Bob's Red Mill whole-wheat flour<br />1/2 c. Bob's Red Mill thick-rolled oats<br />2 T. wheat germ<br />1 1/2 tsp. salt<br />Melted butter<br />Oats<br /><br />The dough may be made in a bread machine or by hand. Bread machine method: Place the water, milk powder, honey, melted butter, yeast, egg, bread<br />flour, whole-wheat flour, oats, wheat germ and salt into a bread machine pan. Set bread machine for whole wheat, dough and large loaf cycle. Form rolls.<br />Hand method: In a large bowl, whisk the water, milk powder, honey, melted butter, yeast and egg. In an extra large bowl, mix the flour, whole wheat flour,<br />oats, wheat germ and salt. Stir in the yeast mixture.<br /><br />Place dough on a well-floured breadboard. Knead until smooth and elastic. Place in an oiled bowl, turn once, then cover with a damp cloth. Turn oven on to 200�F, when you can feel the heat on your hand, turn the oven off.

review/text: I bought this for my mother in law who has an allergic reaction to everything.  I was excited when I saw this was something she could drink and ordered it for her birthday with a custom made wine glass.  It showed up opened and leaking.  NOT impressed.  If they can't fix their packaging and delivery, I would seriously look elsewhere to buy.  They won't even send her a new one.  They'll give her credit but won't refund the cost or send her a new one.

I get 50% of my fiber from one bowl of this and don't have to worry about the usual added (or hidden) sugar or sweeteners that is in many other cereals that say they are healthy like fiber one.  Also, this tastes very good!

review/summary: Tasty and nutritious, but tiny
review/text: I found this cereal accidentally at a local store and I am hooked.<br /><br />The barley malt adds a hint of sweetness so the cereal isn't boring, but the whole grains and flax seeds make it good for you, and it's full of fiber and beneficial fats.  If you're not comfortable with such a large order, pick up a box at a local store -- and come back to Amazon for the bulk discount.<br /><br />I wish that this cereal came in larger packages, as 10 ounces is only five servings.  Also, Amazon seems to have problems shipping them without crushing the tops of the boxes.

review/text: I purchased a box from wal-mart, not really paying too much attention to the nutritional facts at first. After my first bowl (with strawberries on top), I was hooked. I looked at what was actually in the stuff, and it was INCREDIBLY healthy, especially in a time where most cereals are loaded with synthetic ingredients and tons of sugar.<br /><br />A+, Recommend, would buy and eat again...and again...and again.

review/text: I eat this cereal daily because it's natural and nutritious, has plenty of fiber (10 grams per serving), and is very filling.  Unfortunately, the taste and texture is a lot like cardboard.  However, adding 1/2 cup of fresh/frozen fruit and 1 teaspoon of raw sugar makes it much more palatable (even delicious), without making it unhealthy.  After eating this for breakfast, I find it easier to get through my day without snacking.

review/text: Even after altering his diet, my husband still couldn't get his triglycerides down. Not only that, his blood sugar went higher. I was mystified and started to inspect everything he ate. What a shock I got.. all his "health food section" cereals with high fiber were filled with sugar. Some of the "healthy" cereals had more sugar in them than a kid's cereal! Even a certain cereal that is all bran contained High Fructose Corn Syrup.<br /><br />Enter Uncle Sam. 7 ingredients, less than 1 gram of sugar, and has 10 grams of fiber. Oddly, my husband enjoys the taste of it, too. As someone else pointed out, though, if you need something sweet with it, just add some fresh fruits.

review/summary: Delicious & very healthful.
review/text: This is by far my favorite breakfast cereal on the market.  I was introduced  to it about 20 years ago when my doctor recommended it to me as part of a program to lose weight and get my blood pressure down.  But beyond the fact that it's very healthful (no sugar, lots of fiber), it's very tasty.  The toasted flax seeds (which I'd never tasted before) give the cereal a very nice nutty flavor.  It may take you a few bowls to cultivate the taste - and I'd encourage you to resist the temptation to add sugar - because Uncle Sam is not like other cereals.  By volume, I'm satisfied with about half as much as a "normal" cereal. In a word, Uncle Sam cereal is wonderful!

I think it may have been crispier than a lot that I buy in the local grocery store.  It sold at a good price, was received in Amazon's normal timely fashion.

review/text: This cereal has made me a believer that you can enjoy a store bought healthy breakfast and actually know you are eating healthy.  I have tried many healthy cereals, but although good for you, I found them not so good for my pallet or my wallet.  This one, however, I thoroughly enjoyed.  At first, I encountered a "maybe not for me" thought, but after adding a small circle of organic pure honey to it, I tell you it transformed the bowl of cereal for me.  Now I cannot eat any other cereal but this one.  I just love it.  I get my small teaspoon of honey and my needed fiber, not to mention that I feel great afterward.  This is indeed a good buy, and I highly recommended for those who want to still enjoy a quick breakfast that does not brake your wallet, and is truly healthy for you, and taste excellent.

A cup of this cereal plus a cup of strawberries makes a great breakfast.  When we began having problems finding Uncle Sam in our local grocery stores (it was hit or miss -- sometimes they had it, sometimes they didn't), we set up a recurring order from Amazon.  Great price, great product, convenient delivery.  Definitely five stars.

review/summary: Awesome cereal. Lots of fiber, no added sugar
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:03 Mins<br /><br /></span>I'm always looking for healthy cereal options and I saw Uncle Sam original on the store shelf recently and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />It was the box design that caught my eye and as I scanned the box I was pleased to see that the cereal contained 10g of fiber per service and only has 1g of sugar per serving. That's fantastic! And it has a good amount of protein, 7g per serving as well as flaxseed.<br /><br />It is a smallish flake size and there a lots of flaxseeds in the cereal. I enjoy it with yogurt but have also eaten it with Almond Milk and Soy Milk. It holds it's cruch pretty well in liquid and about the only drawback, and I hardly consider it worth mentioning, is that occassionally I get a small flaxseed caught between my teeth. That is certainly no reason to avoid the cereal however.<br /><br />While not the most flavorful cereal you'll come across, keep in mind that most flavor from cereals is coming from the added sugar, salt and artificial ingredients. I like the fact that this cereal is healthy and full of whole grains, flaxseed and no added junk.<br /><br />I'd buy this again and will.

review/text: I've been eating Uncle Sam's original cereal and mix it with puffed brown rice cereal and puffed whole red wheat cereal with nothind added. As far as sweetening that a number of people seem to express a need for I just eat some banana and canned unsweetened-nothing added sliced pineapple with it. I stay away from sweeteners like honey and sugar even if raw and natural. I find after a number of years of avoiding sweetened food that I don't like food that is sweetened especially if you have unsweetened fruit with it. I certainly don't eat food with regular sugar added. Can't stand sweetened bread, for instance.

review/summary: Uncle Sam Toasted Whole Wheat Flakes= AMAZING
review/text: This was recommended to me on amazon, I was not sure about buying it on here because it comes in 6 boxes and if I hated it what was i going to do with all that cereal? I do have a weakness for cereal, but i like to keep the cereal i eat low in fat and sugar. I am also a vegan so no animal products either.<br /><br />The cereal meets all my requirements. I like to eat stuff that is good for me but also does not taste like cardboard. This cereal has some what of a ganola type consistency. The flaxseeds are whole, so be careful you might end up with some in your teeth.<br /><br /> I mix 1/2 cup of this cereal with 1.5 cups of Arrowmill's puffed kamut cereal. This adds the extra texture and slight sweetness to the puffed kamut. You get plenty of fiber and OMEGA fatty acids from the flaxseeds.<br /><br />All around great cereal. After i finish my stash of cereal I will order the 6 boxes from here :)

review/summary: Breakfast Staple at a Better Price
review/text: About the cereal:<br />Uncle Sam is a plain, healthy cereal with lots of fiber from whole wheat and some essential fatty acids (healthy fat) from flax seeds. It has no added sugar and very little naturally occurring sugar, making it a good choice for anyone watching his/her sugar intake. It definitely takes some chewing if you eat it dry or right after adding your milk/non-dairy milk but the flakes get very mushy and the flax seeds absorb some liquid quickly so unless you like soggy you want to eat right away! There isn't a great deal of flavor here so I like to use a vanilla almond or coconut milk with it or even pair it with some fruit. My 5 stars isn't as much for the flavor as for the nutritional content but it is still a good cereal!<br /><br />About the price:<br />I have yet to find a store selling Uncle Sam for a lower or even comparable price to the one you pay if you buy this from Amazon with subscribe and save! My mom and my sister both eat plenty of this cereal so I am very happy to have it delivered by Amazon at a great price every few months; I always have a stash of it in my cupboard for when family is here!

I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Uncle Sam's cereal fit my requirement for no flour and suprisingly it also had an excellent taste.<br /><br />My favorite way to eat it is with plain yogurt, a no calorie sweetener and a serving of fruit.  It makes a great breakfast but I have also used it as an evening desert or snack.<br /><br />Now not only can I enjoy it, I can also have it delivered right to my door without having to drive to a distant town specifically to buy it and hope the shelf isn't empty.

It really stands up in milk and doesn't get soggy. Usually I add a few raisins, walnuts, chopped dates, and dried, sweetened cranberries--that's a breakfast that keeps you satisfied for hours. Be sure to shake the box back and forth before pouring out the cereal so that the flax seeds, which sink to the bottom, get mixed into each bowlful. Lately, various grocery stores have stopped carrying Uncle Sam, so I am forced to buy it on Amazon.

review/summary: High Fiber Cereal with Great Taste
review/text: The South Beach Diet refers to Uncle Sam cereal, so my husband and I wanted to try it. I couldn't find it locally, but found it at Amazon and ordered it. It is THE BEST high-fiber cereal we have ever tried! It actually taste GOOD (which is more than I can say about a few other high-fiber cereals we've tried). This is our breakfast choice on the days we go to the YMCA to work out because of its "staying power" to thwart the hunger pangs until lunch time. We highly recommend this cereal. Try it. I bet you'll like it, too!

review/summary: A very good and healthy way to start the day
review/text: This cereal is fantastic.  The taste of the cereal is true and real, not sweet at all.  You can see the original shape of the berry before it was rolled.  It is also really good on yogurt as a topping.  The only drawback is that the flaxseeds can get stuck in your gums.  I'm glad to see that you can still get a good cereal without all of the artifical stuff.  I've been trying to avoid HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup) in the food I eat and I've been able to lose some pounds and inches.<br />Keeping with some advice from experts, this is a good fiber-rich cereal that does not create a blood sugar spike and is an important way to start your day.  With so much media attention to diabetes and blood sugar, this cereal makes a good compnent especially if you're trying to keep your sugar level.  Low sodium too boot!  The flax seeds seem to give me some energy that keeps me going during the day.

review/text: You cannot go wrong with this cereal. I had sworn off cereal because of the hunger I often felt only two hours after breakfast! With Uncle Sam cereal, because it is low glycemic - no hunger. However, eating it without a sweetener will take some getting used to, and is an acquired taste. Personally, I eat it with Splenda and it's yummy! I usually get my cereal in two days - never had a problem. Amazon Prime is definitely worth it.

Not too sweet, and it doesn't get soggy in milk. It works great with sliced up bananas or raisins or berries tossed in, or by itself.

review/text: This cereal is my staple now for breakfast, only I put a little twist on it. I miss one box with an equal amount of old-fashioned oatmeal and cook it like oatmeal. I just add some fruit when I start the boil and it is a wonderful, hearty breakfast that holds me and my husband until lunch. It is healthy and complex which equals a good way to start the day. I highly recommend it! Occasionally can be found at the store, but I get the subscription pack of 6 which lasts the 2 of us 2-3 months.

review/text: But not with milk... I prefer vanilla soymilk and I add dates, dried coconut and sliced almonds. Delicious! I mix up two boxes of this, one box of dates (the purple box you can buy at Walmart), and coconut & almonds to taste. I keep the entire mixture in a large reusable plastic container.<br /><br />I use the finely shredded, dried, unsweetened coconut that you can buy at an Asian grocery or health food store, because it is natural and requires no refrigeration. The sweetened, shredded coconut that you can buy in a bag in a regular grocery store contains propylene glycol (e.g. automotive antifreeze) and the canned or fresh coconut must be refrigerated.<br /><br />The only thing I don't understand is why the price is so high here... come on Amazon! This is under $2 a box at Walmart when you buy a single box!

review/summary: Great product at an outstanding price!
review/text: I discovered Uncle Sam while trying to drastically cut the amount of sugar from my diet.  At less than a gram of sugar per serving, this cereal definitely does the trick!  I always add either blueberries or strawberries, since my sweet tooth still isn't under complete control yet ;o).  From a financial standpoint, Amazon does a terrific job of keeping the price reasonable and, with the Subscribe and Save feature, it is less than any supermarket I've seen (including my personal favorite, Trader Joe's).<br /><br />Why only four stars since the product is good and the price is right?  After recently researching the benefits of flax, I figured I had this covered, seeing as it is one of the ingredients in my daily bowl of Uncle Sam cereal.  However, everything I've read states that the flaxseed must be ground to elicit benefit from it, as the whole seed simply passes through the body undigested.  If that's the case, then the flax is there merely for the crunch that it adds, and not for nutritional value.  It doesn't mean I'll eat any less of the cereal, but that I just need to incorporate flax in my diet somewhere else.

I guess people back then didn't care what shit tasted like. They would probably just about any old thing since this was likely when food was invented. Most people were used to eating dirt and old turtle shells they would find on the wagon trail and then Uncle Sam came along and blew their mind with these gravel flakes. I mean barley. Want a bowl of barley and clay? Step up to Uncle Sams!<br /><br />I don't even know what to do with the rest of this box. I guess I'll just set it on fire.

The flax seeds makes it taste nasty and it isn't even remotely sweet. I recommend you go to your local health food store and buy a single box before buying this stuff in bulk here on Amazon.<br /><br />PS For an alternative to this I strongly recommend the Kashi cereals! My favorites are "Kashi Heart to Heart Blueberry Clusters" and the "Kashi U Currants & Walnuts". The Kashi Go-Lean is a good choice too if your looking for a more healthy, plain, cereal. Another favorite of mine is Nature's Path Optimum Blueberry Cinnamon Cereal. By the way, these are all available here on Amazon!

review/text: Campbells Chunky "Healthy request" Clam Chowder tastes horrible. It's that simple. I wouldn't eat it again if it was free, really, I wouldnt. Only thing that could save this chowder is if you added at least a Tsp or two. of salt. about a 1/4 c of heavy cream, at least 2 TBSP of butter and a 6 oz can of clams to the 18.8oz can, as this stuff is all but devoid of those three things. If you like watery, bland potato soup, this stuff is for you!<br /><br />My suggestion: Just get the real stuff, but eat less of it and you get the same calories. At least you will enjoy each bite rather than cringe and after the 3rd bite throw it out. Maybe that is their plan. Make food so bad you just throw it out and lose weight from starvation.

But now that I am on a low sodium diet, I have to look for substitutes.<br /><br />When I tried the Healthy Request version of Chunky Chicken Noodle, it tasted identical to the regular version. So I assumed that this Healthy Request version of New Englan Clam Chowder would also be as good as its regular version, but it isn't. It tastes awful. It's so bad that I can't possibly eat it. So I wasted my money by ordering a case.<br /><br />Now that I have learned my lesson, the hard way. Before I will order a case of any food product from Amazon. I first try it out by buying a single can from a local grocery store. If it isn't available to try locally. Then I simply won't order a case from Amazon.

So you're left with this pale, thin, flavorless gruel of a soup. Seriously, if Hitler were around today, this would be his favorite soup. Who taste tested this garbage and said they liked it? Because they're idiots who should be beaten with sacks of fresh clams, which should then be made into a soup that tastes like something. If this were the last can of soup on earth, I'd kill myself before eating it. It's just that bad. Did I mention it tasted like nothing and that it would be Hitler's favorite chowder?
