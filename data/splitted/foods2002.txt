review/summary: Hairball reducer AND soft fur all in one!
review/text: My 13 year old cat has never liked cat treats.  I have tried a variety over the years, and she wouldn't have anything to do with them.  Until I found this one.  I was really happy to finally find something to reward her, or get her to come to me when called.  These treats have petroleum in them.  My cat loves Vaseline, so it makes sense that she likes these.  I have noticed a decrease in the frequency of her throwing up.  The great surprise that I found is that her fur has become softer!  I know it must be the petroleum in these that is coating her fur as well.  I have to feed her a special cat food because she has a tendancy towards the urinary tract infection, and since I have been doing that, her fur has been more coarse and dry.  These treats have brought back the softness to her fur.  I'm sold, and I will be buying these from now one.  My very picky cat loves them!

review/summary: This must be crack for cats
review/text: My four cats adore this.  They split one bag every night.  I mistakenly gave some  to a stray cat that I feed and he would not leave the deck until I gave him a whole bag.  My mother's cat is also addicted and requires a hand full every day.  She stares pointedly between my mother and her food bowl until she gets enough.<br /><br />Since one my cats has some dental problems this cat food is great as a treat that is good for them.

review/summary: Cats can't get enough
review/text: With other treats, my cats eat a few and then they've had enough. With these treats, they'd eat the entire bag and more in one sitting, if given the chance! My female will stare at or attempt to get into the drawer where I store them. I can't feed them to my male with my fingers because he gets so excited he tries to eat my finger, too. These are definitely a favorite.

review/text: Pick up the bag, give it a shake and your cat will come running. They'll start purring before you even get the bag open.  I give about 5-6 of these to my cats every day and they gobble them right up.  Leaves their breath 'better' than normal (not like they've just brushed or anything) and they never leave any behind.

review/summary: All 5 of my Cats go CRAZY for these!
review/text: These are truly temptations for our cats and will have them running from any side of the house.  When you open the bag, they actually smell like "french fries" (two of us confirm this) so the smell from the human side is not bad.  We have tried so many other treats but the Whiskas Temptations Chicken flavor are definitely a favorite.<br /><br />They can put weight on your cat quickly and certainly are not meant to be a diet.  But for treats, they are great and our cats really love them.  If our 5 love them, the chances are high that your cats will love them too!

review/text: I was purchasing my cat other treats until I came upon this one. Ever since he tried he couldn't stop. He doesn't want any other kind of treats but the Creamy Dairy flavor ones. Acutally, when he was inside his mother, she ate them while she was pregnant, don't know if it had anything to do with it but cats love these! They should start making gigantic bags of these. I pretty much have to buy them by the dozen for my spoiled rotten cat.

review/text: I've been giving these to my 2 cats everyday after I give them wet food so that their teeth can be somewhat cleaned afterwards. They love the flavor, though after such a long time they're growing weary of the taste. It's well known that cats who eat too much wet food without eating anything crunchy after are prone to tooth decay. This is just one product that can help cut down on long-term dental health issues with your feline.<br /><br />The only downside to this product is that it only comes in 1 flavor; my cats want variety. Do yours?

HOWEVER these treats are very small and when you have a 17lb large cat he doesn't have to chew them... he just swallows them whole. Therefore they aren't working on the teeth. Fun treat but not going to work for his breath. Will have to find something else.

review/text: I got this to give to our cat as an occasional treat. Like many of the reviewers here my cat now acts like an addict. I don't know what they put in this stuff, but she wants it all day and all night. It's gotten so she has started pestering me non stop. I'm glad I found a treat she likes, but it's a nightmare if we run out. I just came on here to order another box. I'm not sure if I want to keep dealing with this. I might have to consider kitty cat rehab.

As for treats same thing, she would not eat every kind. I bought a pack of temptations to try her and she goes crazy for them, i once left a package of them on my coffee table and went out and when i got back the cat had knocked them off the table and ripped the bag open and ate them all. (i think that these are equivalent to smoking to humans) its very addictive to cats.. 5 stars.. *****

review/text: I've been giving my cat medication for a little over a year now and I just hate prying open his mouth and dropping the pill in.  If I get one of these treats ready beforehand it triggers his attention to the treat instead of the pill.  I give him his medication and then immediately give him the treat.  (not in the same fashion, however)  He used to run and hide every time I opened his pill case now at least he sticks around.  It makes it easier for me too.

My cats also love Party Mix, does that mean they are drugged product.<br /><br />That being said please do not listen to non-scence on these ratings.<br /><br />My cats do love these temptations... They do not beg for them,,,, but they do like them!<br /><br />I feed them each 10 treats at home at a time, the suggested ammount and of course they could go for more (because it is a snack)...<br /><br />I love that these taste good to the cats but they are also very healthy!!!!<br /><br />I have 7 cats. One of my cats will only eat 4-5 treats and she gets FULL easy and the rest can eat ALL that I put down........ My neighbor sais that her cats do not like them because they are spoiled on "people food"... I was shocked when she returned the bag I sent them for Christmas!<br /><br />I tried to get them to eat them also and they walked away, tried to also put one in there mouth...<br /><br />I also have 35 cats in our shelter and they ALL love these treats, they will eat as many as you give them.... We cannot afford to buy these for them all the time but we get it for them every few months.. We keep them all the time for our own cats!<br /><br />They are a great product, I like to buy the large bags because you are saving money!

review/text: All my cats, but one like them.  I foster cats and have 14 now.  They come running at night, after I have scooped the litter boxes.  They know it is treat time.  It is a real convenience to have a box of Temptations delivered  to my door...especially in the winter with the snow on the ground.

review/summary: My cat loves it.. I don't know if I do.
review/text: Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running. I'm thinking he could smell it from across the room. I gave him one and it disappeared instantly, and he looked up right away and begged for more. I gave him a few more and put it away but he would not stop begging until I gave him more. One more, that's it. I put it away again and my cat got all feisty and testy with me. He started biting my empty fingers until I gave in again!<br /><br />I don't really like how it unleashes the BEAST in my sweet cat, but I can tell he loves it. It's like a drug even! With that said, I don't think I'll buy another pack for him. He loved his old treats but it never made him go crazy. There must be some kind of MSG-equivalent in these treats that makes them beg for more. I've never seen him act so ravenous after getting a treat.

review/text: I have many different flavors of these treats for my cats. They like this flavor, but something tells me they like the animal flavors better, whether it is fish or mammals. Don't get me wrong they love this flavor, but I don't think it is the best flavor you can buy.<br /><br />Temptations is most likely the best treat brand you can buy though, they never fail. Just shake the bag, and look, I have cats!

review/text: I didn't have very high expectations for these treats when I first bought them - we were just out of their other treats and I thought I'd give these a shot. Not only do our cats love them, but we've seen a huge difference in the amount of hairballs from our two furballs. We used to have hairball messes to deal with many times a week, and now it's down to just a few a month. I've now put these on our Subscribe & Save list to make sure we never run out. I love that I am giving them something they love that also happens to be so good for their insides. And as a huge bonus, we have a lot fewer messes to clean up/step in. We all win!

review/summary: Kitty Crack
review/text: All three of my cats are crazy about these.  They like the salmon and tuna flavors best. They all beg for them in one way or another.  One cat will sit and stare at me and if that doesn't work, he'll curl up on my shoulder and purr as loud as he can. Another one of my cats just bops me with his paw to let me know he wants treats.  The more I ignore him, the harder he hits me.  I eventually have to tell him no, because I don't want to overdo it with the treats. Anyway, they all love them and I've noticed silkier coats since adding these to their diet.

I'm sure that giving them different flavors means more to me, than it does to my cats; they don't seem to chew them long enough to taste them.  But they insist on two or three each time they come in the house, I'm sure it's a form of addiction.  I'm buying these on the "Subscribe & Save" program, which save money and time compared to buying them locally.<br /><br />Cats love these things!

review/summary: Whiskas Temptations Hairball Control Chicken Flavour Treats for Cat
review/text: With four cats in the household hairballs are a given. It got to be an almost daily routine to hear and see one or more of them gagging and coughing, trying to get rid of a build up of hair in their system. Why their digestive tracts haven't evolved to handle this problem over thousands of years mystifies me. Not only do they groom themselves, they also groom each other.<br /><br />We've tried several different products to try to alleviate this problem and nothing helped. Then we came across the Temptations treats. They have helped considerably. The cats seem to relish them, not knowing they're being given "medicine". Whilst the treats haven't completely ended the hairball issue they have been a great help. Now, it can be weeks if not months without any hairballs.<br /><br />If your cats have a problem with hairballs then give this product a try.<br /><br />Also, with Amazon's Subscribe and Save you'll save money.

review/summary: Big Yellow Pillow Mints or Really Bad Butter Mints?
review/text: I was looking forward to some good butter mints and still am. These do not come in a branded packange as shown but a clear plastic bag, granted there are a lot of them, but the "butter mints" are not creamy/buttery but are more or less big yellow pillow mints, there is none of the butter mint flavor or texture. A small percentage of them have bright yellow or orange spots on them, I am not sure what is up with that but would not eat them.<br /><br />So if you like a a large, dry, crunchy yellow colored over-sized pillow mints, perhaps best usedfor a decrative candy jar then these would be pretty good especially the spotted ones, but if you were looking for buttermints these is probably not for you.

review/text: Being a mustard affectianco, for lo these 60 brief years, I came upon the brand of mustard while living in Florida. It is superb on most all things I've put it on, in fact I can't think of a thing I've used it on that I didn't prefer the taste of this brand compared to any other.<br /><br />THe only thing I don't agree with is the method by which the company prefers to package it for sale in my neck of the woods (Arkansas), they put it in a plastic squeeze bottle and won't sell it in a plain jar. I hate squeeze bottles, they are such a waste once you get to the bottom part, sometimes you'll throw away a quarter of what you are enjoying and paying for.<br /><br />Needless to say, my wife ands I were delighted to find it being sold, in a jar on the internet. We had a nice transaction and will be doing it again.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Ray Morgan

review/summary: Kitties Can't Have Enough Of This.
review/text: This product beats most processed cat foods, it has plenty of flakes and the smell is strong enough to attract and kick off your cat's apetite. They have just the right amount of juice/water and its consistency is hardy enough to be more than just an appetizer.<br /><br />My cat loves this food. I have switched entirely to this food. I prefer it over other cup or canned foods, because I can see the actual fish flakes and not just some blended mess; it still has some preservatives, but they are minimal compared to other foods.<br /><br /> If you susbscribe to Amazon's delivery (Subscribe & Save), you can save a lot of money compared to your local store's price or a one time only purchase here at Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, a great product, cats love it, they don't get sick and seem happier overall, they can't have enough of this.<br /><br />NOTE/WARNING: This product is made in Thailand. Not the U.S.A.

review/summary: Are More Fond Of Others
review/text: I have ordered several flavors of Fancy Feast Appetizers to use in the rotational feeding of my 4 cats. Flaked Skipjack Tuna is not their favorite. They are a bit spoiled and when the local grocer or drug store has White Albacore Tuna on sale at a dollar a can, or even less, I stock up on the Albacore and give it out on Special occasionas to the kids. Special occasions may be Sundays, holidays, or, any day that I am tired and want to open one big, dense can of food that feeds several mouths!<br />Because they get such nice "human" Tuna, I think that kitty Tuna is just a little beneath them on any normal day.<br />Now, I do also feed a Feral Cat and since my indoors guys were reluctant to eat the Skipjack Tuna, I gave it to my Feral kitty. He gets real Albacore only 4 or 5 times a year. He scarfed the Skipjack right up.<br />So, my overall impression of how well a kitty eats this Appetizer Tuna depends upon how much human Tuna is normally put on his plate. If he is not so spoiled as my indoor guys, he will eat it without any reservations.<br />By now, my quest is finding kitty food that is unusual; therefore, new to the kitty palate. In the Fancy Feast Appetizer line, my indoor kittys like the Talapia <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OPQDDY">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Steamed Tilapia, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 10)</a> and the white meat chicken <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OPQKN2">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, White Meat Chicken, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 10)</a>. Both of these are 5 store encores for my cats, while the Skipjack is a 4 Star, BUT, if your kitty is not spoiled by Albacore, he should like the SkipJack just fine. I do recommend it, but at my house the Talapia and the chicken are eaten more quickly.

review/summary: A pricey  treat that my cats usually like.
review/text: This is a high quality product that comes in an excessive double wrapped container.  I think the packaging must contribute to the high price.  My cats like to start the day with it.  I split one container between two cats.<br />On the plus side, this is a very clean looking and smelling food, which is rare among pet foods.<br />On the con side, it is more expensive than many food items you are likely to buy for yourself or your family.<br />When it is available on subscription from Amazon, give it a try.

review/summary: Premium Edge Senior Dog Food Lamb and Rice
review/text: I have fed my last two dogs Premium Edge Senior dog food with lamb being the protein.  I am currently mixing it with Premium Edge large breed puppy chow which is a 27/16 protein/fat.  Typically German Shepherd's are fed<br />large breed puppy chow through 15 months.  My GS has Panoesteitis (Long Bone Disease) and I needed to reduce the protein without any additional growth components while still feeding her the necessary requirements.  She eats Premium Edge Large Breed Puppy Chow Lamb based and I substitute one of her four cups a day with the Senior Light.  I discontinued her vitamins due to the excess protein and I feed her as mentioned above.  I think the added supplements for seniors helped with her limp and strengthened her bones overall.  She is 13m months old and almost done with the Panoestetis; it is a self-limiting disease and generally heals by 18mo - 2 yrs.  I am not advocating that protein causes Panoesteitis - its just one of the mentioned possible causes.<br />I would recommend Premium Edge which is made by Diamond foods.  Google Diamond Foods and you will see all the brands they supply.

review/summary: Miracle Dog Food
review/text: I cannot say enough good stuff about this dog food.  I've been using this dog food for over 10 years and it has been difficult at best to find.  I'm so glad to see it on amazon!<br /><br />My 8 yo 50 lb. mutt was showing signs of age, sleeping a lot, and basically not much else.  My vet asked what I fed him and I told him Science Diet.  He said - well that's a good food.  I was then turned onto this food (for my 65+ lb lab) and I noticed an enormous difference in my mutt.  He became the fun active dog I'd always known him to be and basically stayed that way till he died at 15.5 years old.  I totally attribute his activity and long life to this food.<br /><br />My lab was always active so in all honesty I did not notice any changes in her.  The food is dosed with glucosamine and chondroitin for healthy joints - which is a nice to have when you have larger breed dogs that sometimes have joint problems.

review/summary: vet recommended
review/text: My Boston is 12 yrs old. Two years ago, he developed a skin condition characterized by flaking, excessive itching and bald spots on his coat. The vet prescribed methazolamide and Omega -3 fish oil: the former was toxic to his system, the latter, alone, didn't improve the condition. She then suggested Premium Edge in combination with the fish oil. I started out with the salmon (blue bag) which he's been up until this month. This time I ordered the lamb and he gobbles it up despite the fact that it's never a good idea to change your pet's diet, taste-wise anyway. Since he's been on Premium Edge, his coat has returned to normal and he no longer suffers itching. Whether or not the cessation of symptoms can be attributed wholly to Premium Edge may be coincidental but I wouldn't feed him anything else, either. I order the 35-lb bag because, for an elder 24 lb dog, it lasts months. Also, I no longer add fish oil. This food seems to provide all the nutritional requirements for a soon-to-be 13 yr old terrier.

I did have to do a Google search to find Amazon's number since it is practically impossible to find on the site.  However, the call itself was quick and painless.

review/summary: Love the Item; Packing Needs Improvement-Cracked Containers
review/text: I love the product and have no complaints with it. My problem is with the shipping. I have received two shipments of this product where two of the containers in each shipment were cracked and the umeboshi paste had leaked out, making a mess in the plastic bags they were packed in. I think this could have been avoided if better packing materials were used so that the product containers were not able to move around so freely inside the box instead of using the air-filled bags. Those air-filled bags still allow movement inside the box. I receive packages of food items from other companies who pack their products tightly inside the boxes and I've never received any items with leakage.

review/text: I can't say enough about this product. I received it two weeks ago, sans problems with the packaging that others have mentioned, and two packages are already gone.  This paste has now completely replaced salt in my kitchen, and basically lemon as well.<br /><br />My only problem is trying to resist eating it on everything, because the sodium adds up quickly.  The corn on the cob trick is totally delicious, and my new favorite thing is tomato and avocado dressed simply with some thinned out umeboshi.  I couldn't be happier.

review/summary: Do not have this shipped with heavy items!
review/text: I completely agree with some of the other reviewers here. I ordered mine along with several other items at the same time and didn't realize how poorly they were going to be packaged until I got my box with 2 of the 3 Umeboshi paste packages damaged and leaking everywhere. Amazon shipped this delicate item in a large box along with over 4 pounds of backing flours. What was the thinking Amazon?!?! Thankfully, they refunded me entirely for the damaged products which had to be thrown out for fear of contamination from other items in the box. Next time though, I will definitely NOT have these shipped with anything else.<br />Since this is a review of the product, I will say that the product itself is very good and very useful in a LOT of vegan/gluten-free baking. This is all I ever use it for anyway and a little goes a long way!
