review/summary: golden raisins are the good ones
review/text: It used to be, when I was growing up, that the raisins that came in little boxes always had stems.  And curiously, when you'd get a box of Raisin Bran, those raisins were stem-free.  (And sugar coated.)  I don't know if there are different standards in raisin processing.  But at any rate, the golden raisins never seem to have stems and they are less dry and crunchy, than purple raisins can occasionally be.  I like them on cereal mixed with blueberries and cranberries and it looks very pretty with the three primary colors together.

review/summary: Highest Quality Relaxing Tea
review/text: *****<br /><br />Sweet Meadows is a very relaxing high-quality Numi tea. This herbal tea is certified organic and is kosher. The whole organic chamomile blossoms used in this tea have been cultivated in Egypt's northern valley, and are combined with the finest organic lemon myrtle from the rainforests of Australia. The tea itself is caffeine-free, of course, and has a flowery chamomile and citrus-y flavor.<br /><br />If you like Numi herbal teas, get it---you won't be sorry.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Lifesaver
review/text: Whoever came up with this is a genius and a lifesaver. I too only use formula when I'm on the go or need to supplement if I don't have enough breast milk, so the can is a waste since I won't finish it in a month. The packets are so convenient. I carry a bottle or two of 4oz water and a couple of packets in my purse at all times for emergencies. Paid $10.69 for a box of 16 at Target.<br /><br />Only 4 out of 5 stars because you can only make 4 oz or 8 oz.  So if your baby is currently eating more than 4oz but less than 8oz you either hope he is satisfied with 4oz or make 8oz and waste some.

review/summary: Wonderful dog food, good price
review/text: This dog food was recommended by our standard poodle's breeder.  She feeds it to both her breeding dogs and her show dogs.  Our dog loves it, and eats every bit of his breakfast, lunch and dinner right down.<br /><br />The breeder said for us to mix the food with a little warm water and a tablespoon of plain, unflavored, nonfat yogurt.  My vet agreed, and said that the yogurt was an excellent addition.  He also has standard poodles as his personal pets.<br /><br />As poodle owners know, the breed can be susceptible to a horrible stomach condition called "bloat."  Feeding your poodle a top grade dog food on a regular schedule is very important for these lovely animals.  This dog food fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />It is interesting that this is an adult dog food, but the kibble is smallish, and if mixed with the warm water while the dog is a puppy, it can be used throughout the dog's life, once he/she is weaned.  You do not need a puppy chow when the dog is young.<br /><br />This seller provides this food at a fair price, and ships promptly.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/text: This is the first and only iced tea I have purchase since owning my brewer for the past year.  I put off buying iced tea due to the expense and thought how much different could it be from those cheep container mixes you find at the grocery store.  Boy was I wrong.  For starters my favorite ice tea is the half and half lemonade, and I find that these deliver the right amount of flavor, sweetness and that freshely brewed flavor I would expect from a Keurig brewer.  I find myself hiding my k cups from the rest of my family and complaining when the ice tray hasn't been refilled.  Keep in mind everyone's tastes are different and I tend to like my drinks sweet, I find the smaller tea cup setting on my brewer to work the best for this, without having to add additional sweetner or sugar.

review/text: I love going by Starbucks during the hot summer days here in Texas and ordering a shaken black tea lemonade sweetened with light ice. When I got my Keurig brewer and was checking out the drink selections for iced tea I came across this one and had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised that the taste is accurate for the ratio of tea/lemonade and the sugar was sweetened just enough. My son and I love them and he is the one that discovered that the 6 oz. water setting is best for the maximum flavor. These are a staple in my household and I love my Keurig brewer and will be saving money by drinking these at home instead of going to my local Starbucks! They are on 70 calories per serving and you get 25% of your Vitamin C intake for the day too.

review/summary: Celestial Half and Half lemonade tea for Keurig brewers.
review/text: I purchased a box of 16 of these half-and-half (black tea and lemonade) k-cups at Bed, Bath & Beyond.  They had a $9.99/box sale, and it was too good to pass up--especially since my better half loves lemonade iced tea.  Sadly, it was a bit of a disappointment.  It was barely different from the "Perfect Iced Tea -- Sweet Lemon Tea," and didn't have the bite of lemonade.  I wasn't expecting perfection--I realize that lemonade in any form is asking a lot from a hot beverage machine, but it was still a bit of a let down.  Also, I prefer to sweeten my drinks with Splenda.  (I don't need 13 grams of carbs from a glass of iced tea.)<br /><br />That said, my Keurig Limited Edition remains the best coffee machine I have owned to date, and the Coffee People "Donut Shop" variety is my favorite every-morning k-cup.

review/summary: Mmmmmm....so good....
review/text: I first tried this k-cup as a sample.  I was hesitant at first because most teas for the Keurig brewer are either bland, weak, or both.  The sample I tried came in a pack of 4 different iced tea flavors from Celestial Seasonings.  They were are suprisingly very good brewed over ice.  But, this one was by far my favorite.  It has a nice blend of "teaness" and lemon-y sweetness.  A pack of equal or splenda really brightens up the flavors.  I was instantly hooked and ordered a big box of this stuff on Amazon right after trying this drink.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, there is one big caveat to this drink.  It is a caloric drink.  So, if you are looking to restrict your caloric intake in terms of sugary beverages, becareful with this k-cup.  There isn't a whole lot of calories (about 1/2 a can of soda's worth), but it's still there and considering how good this drink is, it's hard to just drink 1.  Other than that, I think this is the best non-coffee beverage available on the Keurig brewer.

review/text: First, what I love about this flavor is that it's iced tea that is ready in under a minute. Whenever I want iced tea, it's there and doesn't require a lot of work. That being said, I wish it was a little more lemonade flavored than just lemon-ey. Sometimes if I let the drink sit a little too long it takes on pretty acidic lemon flavor that isn't all that pleasant. I also stumbled across a sample pack of the Southern Sweet Tea flavor since ordering this product and I've enjoyed it much more. This flavor is a good try by Celestial Seasonings but it still needs a little work.

review/summary: This is a first for me
review/text: Wow, I've never not liked one of the coffees or teas that are made for the Keuring...at least until now.<br /><br />Weak and flavorless and is the best I can say about this. You get neither a good tea taste nor a lemonade taste.  You do seem to get a bit of a bitter after-taste though. This may be due to  how much the ice cubes melt during production.  Frankly it is easier and less expensive to have a gallon of a good brand pre-made combination drink on hand.<br /><br />Brewed on 8 ounce setting as per manufacturers recommendation.<br /><br />*SAMPLE PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER*

review/summary: Best Tea Ever!
review/text: I love this tea! Although I'm a sweet tea lover, this tea is not too sweet but sweet enough to satisfy your taste buds. I used to buy it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, but they don't carry it anymore. It's not overly flavored with lemon--just the right amount. Out of all the teas and coffees I have, this one always runs out first.

review/summary: Daily ritual now!
review/text: After reading the reviews, I was a little skeptical about this iced tea.  Being an "Arnold Palmer" fan, I used to make my own at home.  A pot of brewed tea and store bought lemonade.  It was great, but it took some too time to make, and the store lemonade had a lot of sugar.  So, needless to say, when I got this, I immediately made a cup.  I found that the 6oz. setting was the best.  Everyone that has tried it, has really liked it, even the pickiest of my friends and family members.  I don't know what the "chemical" taste that some reviews are talking about, nor the fake sugar taste.  I like the fact that it's real tea, and that the lemonade side isn't too overpowering.<br /><br />I drink this probably at least twice a day now, and will keep it stocked in my Keurig pod holder!

review/text: I bought these by accident, but I'm glad that I did. I intended to buy the Southern Sweet Tea flavor, but clicked on the wrong product (I was shopping by image, saw the little ice symbol, and didn't even notice I ordered the wrong thing until it arrived). I decided to give it a try anyway, and I was surprisingly pleased with it. I will say that I think it needs to be sweeter (so I add some stevia or splenda), but otherwise I think it is pretty good. If you like Snapple or Arizona tea with lemon flavor, you will like the Celestial Seasonings Half & Half K-Cup.

review/summary: High Fiber in a Tasty, Healthy Snack
review/text: South Beach Diet Fiber Bars/Chewy Granola Bars are tastier than your average granola bar but not quite as tasty as your average chocolate bar--they definitely occupy the middle ground between these two extremes. The rich dark chocolate flavor is quite noticeable in these dense snack bars, which also contain 6 grams of protein and a whopping 9 grams of fiber (that's 36% of the RDA) per serving. These nutritional benefits somewhat offset the fact that saturated fat accounts for more than half of the fat content per serving (2 of the 3.5 fat grams per serving). Each bar contains 120 calories, so overall, this is a pretty good choice if you're trying to balance taste and nutrition.

review/summary: Way Overpriced
review/text: Whoa...in doing my research I noticed that one box of South Beach Diet Bar Fiber Granola Bar (that's a mouthful isn't it) costs $23.92 if you order it on Amazon. I have prime but I realize that not everyone does so if you factor in another couple bucks for shipping...ridiculous price. I'm not sure how much a box of this costs in stores (considerably less I would hope) but I daresay that it is unlikely that the price is worth the product. If anyone could use a good diet bar it's me but the problem with diet bars is in the name. They are DIET bars. They aren't supposed to taste great (otherwise you'd be in danger of eating the whole box and what kind of diet is that) so instead they usually taste like a mix of cardboard and...well more cardboard. Now the South Beach Diet Bar Granola Bar isn't THAT awful. Don't take that delicious looking beast on the package for truth. The real product is much flatter...And the taste? Well it tastes exactly what you would think a chocolate diet bar would taste like. It's unfair for me to bash a diet bar based on taste after admitting that diet bars aren't SUPPOSED to taste good but that image on the package really got my hopes up.<br /><br />But how effective is the bar? Effective enough. I ate one this morning and I didn't eat again till later this evening. That's not really praise for the diet bar, I have a pretty hectic schedule. But maybe I didn't notice the hunger as much. I'm guessing I could eat a granola bar (get better taste at a cheaper price) and be the same level as hungry. So if you take diets/diet bars seriously then this might be the bar for you. It doesn't really have anything to separate it from the other snack bars out there other than the South Beach name but hey, what do I know?

review/text: The South Beach Diet Bar (Dark Chocolate) offer a tasty but relatively healthy treat.  It has a rich though not overly sweet taste and is fiber rich while low on calories.  Don't expect it to taste like candy - this is a granola bar, after all - but it does offer a rare treat for those trying to lose weight.  While the heavier fiber intake may make it a little bit of an acquired taste, the chocolate makes it a lot easier to acquire.  If the rest of losing weight could only be this easy!

review/summary: Fills the Void
review/text: These diet bars have a rich dark chocolate taste but they're a little gritty (too much sugar)? I think the most important aspect of any diet product, if it's palatable and these are, is whether or not they're filling. These do fill the void, but with so much fiber you can expect a gassy side effect. They're kind of like drinking Slim Fast which many people refer to as gas in a can, but that's the sacrifice we dieters have to make to lose weight. They're great if you get up late and cannot wait to cook a plate!

These diet bars are a good choice for anyone on such a program, or really for anyone who just feels like having a healthy and tasty snack or light dessert from time to time. I liked them, and my wife liked them, too.

review/text: Since mid-May I am on WeightWatchers diet, need to put whole grains into my diets (pasta, bread, rice, etc.). I used this today in a macaroni salad. It said to boil 10 to 12 mins, but I'd say, no more than 10; it cooks quickly, and if you overdo it, some will split. It has 5 grams of fiber per 2oz serving, and since I'm on a high-fiber, low fat diet, this is very good. It has barely no sodium. I'm used to whole wheat pasta and like that a lot, but this one will take a little getting used to, not as dense; but for my purposes, it will do.

review/summary: Healthier than Whole Wheat alone and taste even better
review/text: I love the tastes of this pasta. It tastes even better than just 100% whole wheat. Kamut is a wheat type of grain but for what I have read has more micro nutrients (more healthy) and most of person that are gluten intolerant can eat Kamut with no problem. And Buckwheat is pretty nutritious (Whole grain buckwheat is an amazingly nutritious food. Even though it's protein is relatively low at approximately 11%, the protein buckwheat does have contains the eight essential amino acids and is one of the few "grains" (remember that buckwheat isn't a grain at all is more like a fruit) high in lysine. If you use half buckwheat flour with your wheat flour, the buckwheat's amino acids will round out the limiting amino acids in your wheat nicely, giving you a nearly perfect balance of the 8 essential amino acids. This particular balance between half wheat and half buckwheat flour is much more closely aligned to your dietary needs even than lean beef!!! It's also rich in many of the B vitamins as well as the minerals; phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper and manganese. In addition to this, it's a good oil source of Linoleic acid, one of the two essential fatty acids we must have to be healthy. Nutritionally speaking, buckwheat is a truly impressive food. Taken from [...]. Even though, it said that is organic, it doesn't contain any known certification like (USDA) to prove it, so if you looking for an organic strictly food, you would have to take a leap of faith here.<br /><br />So in conclusion, if you are looking for getting a better (in healthy and tastes) to whole wheat this is a pretty good product.

And I bought them because Amazon led me to believe they were k cups, only to discover I can't use them BECAUSE THEY DON'T GO IN MY MACHINE.<br />I'm writing this as a warning since I've ALSO just found out AMAZON DOESN'T ALLOW RETURNS OF GROCERY ITEMS.<br />Awesome.

review/text: This is not a review on the quality of the coffee but on the Amazon product selection process. I was specifically searching for Keurig cups and so stated in my query. This product was included on the Keurig cup list. When I received my product I discovered pods rather than cups. I should have read the discription more closely but didn't since I was expecting only Keurig cups. The Amazon search process should exclude products that don't meet the query parameters. Otherwise it is buyer beware! I will use that pods but it is not the convience of the cups.

review/summary: Delicious and approcable blend from historic Napa Winery
review/text: A great blend in which Joe Hurliman manages to coax out the absolute best characteristics of each varietal and one that the sum is far greater than it parts.  Were it not for the high price tag, given its obvious edge in complexity and ageability, it would easily replace the Recanati Petit-Sirah/Zinfandel as my blend with which to introduce new wine drinkers to the wonderful world of wine.  The combination of good acidity and balancing fruits make it pretty food-friendly and the wood and tannins combine to make this a real wine with the ability for some nice aging and evolving complexity.

review/text: I belong to a wine tasting group that has somehow evolved (devolved?) into a competitive hors d'oeuvres club. No cheese and crackers for this group (even though that's what would probably complement wine the best). And then one of our group brought these chips. They are just delightful without being fussy, e.g., not spicy, salty, overdone. These are plain and go with everything from dips to hummus to cheese - any cheese. I love to put them in the bottom of a soup bowl and then pour tomato soup over them. They're great on salads, too. A definite "find".

It solved all of his digestive problems; his weight is getting back to normal and his coat is shiny.  He feels better too - lots of energy, doesn't have to potty as often, etc.  Really happy I found a dogfood that is so gentle on his stomach.

review/text: My Assistance Dog loves this food.  After trying numerous foods for dogs with sensitive stomachs, and him refusing to eat, I gave him this Science Diet dog food, as recommended by his vet, and he gobbles it down.  His 'job' is very stressful and he is a very sensitive, alert dog, which leads to his stomach being easily upset, but with Science Diet, he has no problems and loves the food.  I am homebound and ordering the dog food can be pricey, so occasionally I try another high quality brand, but he won't even give it a try...well maybe a bite...but then he sits down and looks at me like 'okay, is this a joke, where's the good stuff?'...it may cost a little more, but he is worth it and earns every bite!

review/summary: Very, yummy!
review/text: I have really enjoyed these caramels.  The flavor, chewiness, and texture are just like the chocolate-covered caramels you find in candy boxes.  Very satisfying if you love caramels.  The flavor of the caramel is very full and rich; I can't tell that it's sugar-free.  The chocolate coating needs some improvement in flavor in my opinion. It could have a richer milk chocolate flavor, and be a bit sweeter and a little silkier.  That said, it doesn't taste bad, and certainly doesn't keep me from enjoying the candy!<br /><br />My very favorite s-f caramels are JUDY'S, but if I can't get those, then these Russell Stover's run a close second.<br /><br />I've avoided all artificial sweeteners for YEARS, only rarely have had regular candy during that time, and until recently didn't do any sort of sugar-free.  Lately I have been really missing nice caramels, and as I need to keep a close eye on the carbs, I've made an exception with this candy being artificially sweetened.<br /><br />On the whole, I think I'd rate this candy 8 or 9 out of 10.  [Very yummy!]

review/text: After making my own bubble tea for the first time with the regular 30mins-1hr boba, I decided to try the minute pearls.  I was quite skeptical about whether the "minute" pearls could be even close to being thoroughly cooked in anything under less than an hour b/c the regular bubbles took that long and there was still raw, dry starch in the center, which was quite annoying even after following the direction strictly.  But with the minute pearls, I pured them into hot boiling water and by the time I turned around they were completely cooked to the center and chewy.  I was ecstatic cos it was just like the kind in my local boba tea shop.  Now i can save my money and make all kinds of tea at home for myself, my husband, friends, family!

I've been eating the dark chocolate bars for years and was delighted to find chocolate with almonds.

review/summary: Delicious sugar free chocolate with no stomach upset
review/text: I have tried other sugar free treats sweetened with malitol and other sugar alcohols. Tasted okay, but caused prohibitive gastric distress. Like the kind of pain you would not wish on your worst enemy, accompanied by a multi-sensory symphony of humiliating bodily expressions. I read that the sweetener erythritol had low glycemic impact, but none of the accompanying health problems, but still felt a bit nervous. All of the current dietary suggestions include a bit of dark chocolate for its antioxident benefits, so I decided to give these bars a try. I am very pleased with the taste of the chocolate. It is very rich and satisfying. No problems with digestion, even when I went a bit overboard with quantity! The erythritol does have a mild "cooling" effect as it melts in your mouth, but I rather liked the effect. Like powdered sugar melting in your mouth, or the coolness of mint without the mint flavor. The almonds (also on many 10 ten food lists of dieticians) are a wonderful addition. I wish it was not so expensive, but I am going to try to limit myself to a piece or two a day for good health and happiness and hope that more competitors enter the erythritol sweetened chocolate market and help drive down the price a bit. In the meantime, I will definitely buy again!

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: I didn't want to buy a case of these before trying them out, so I finally found some at a local health food store.  The dark chocolate with almond is the first one I've tried, and it was great, really gave a good chocolate fix and has so much fiber in it, it was super filling just eating a square (which is so not like me lol!)  I like the ingredients a lot and it is hard to find candy like this that you can eat with no guilt and still actually like the taste.  So far no stomach issues either, it is sweetened with eyrithrotol (spelled wrong I know) and there is almost no other sugar free candy I can find  that is, and most of the other sweeteners used in SF candy do NOT agree with me causing a lot of stomach pain.<br /><br />I'd recommend trying to find one to test before buying a case of something this expensive though - even ask your local health type store if they'll order a case and sell them one by one or something.

review/text: We drink about 4-5 K-cups in our house each day, and this one always seems to be a favorite.  It's hard to find decaf flavors that actually taste good, but I really enjoy this one.  It's the same as most flavored coffees, in that it's a mild/lighter brew.  It tastes exactly like you'd expect a standard French Vanilla brew to, and I don't notice any fun aftertaste (like I do with some brands).  If you love dark/bold brews, this one won't do it for you, but if you just like a little after-dinner treat and don't want to be up all night, this is your K-cup.  Oh - and the person who said they sent the wrong product - you need to rate the seller that sent it (in your account/history settings).  It's not right to take it out on the actual product.
