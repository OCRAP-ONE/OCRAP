review/summary: Too expensive and TOO small!!
review/text: I was excited to get this product for review.  Yes, I am a sucker for nuts, raisins, and walnuts.  To have all three in a yummy chewy bar sounded like heaven.  Then I looked on the back of the package.<br /><br />Carbs.  TONS and TONS of carbs.  Now, I admit I am biased since I have Type C Diabetes.  But it is because of my diabetes that I check labels.  Pamela's may SAY that these bars are healthy, and the ingredients listed are pretty good -- but it was the carbs and sugar contents of each bar that deterred me from being able to fully enjoy my sample.<br /><br />Size.  Pamela's Products Whenever Bars are small.  Very, very small.  The bar itself is chewy and tastes great.  I don't agree that it would keep a person from being hungry or that it could be used as a meal.  Did I mention that the bar was tiny?<br /><br />Price.  These babies are expensive.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the couple of bites I was able to experience, the excess of carbs in each tiny bar and the expensive retail price will definitely keep me from buying more.<br /><br />Natalie S.

review/summary: Can't believe they are gluten free!!
review/text: I love these bars! Very moist, just enough hint of spice to remind me of a spice cake. The bars are moist, the nuts crunchy, the raisins, moist and plentiful. Not a low carb protein bar, but gluten free, and dairy free. Great snack bar. I would recommend these bars to everyone, not just people who can't have gluten.

review/summary: Run Away, Run FAR Away From This Product!
review/text: I grow tired of products that claim to be healthy and the WHENEVER BARS are no exception. When you put ingredients like oatmeal, walnuts and raisins into a food, it certainly gives the illusion that you're consuming something "healthy," right? But when you look at the ingredients list and nutritional info of this OAT RAISIN WALNUT SPICE bar, the reality hits you square between the eyeballs--this is NOT good for you. Although one tiny bar contains only 100 calories, it's mostly carbohydrates that will spike your blood sugar and insulin levels. That's not very good for your body if you're attempting to eat healthy. While I suppose this product is better than most of the carbage sold in stores these days, it's not doing you any favors if you are consuming it as a means to lose weight or improve your health. Of course, if you don't care about either one of those things, then eat up. But if you want to shed pounds and ward off chronic disease, then run away, run FAR away from this product.

review/text: I'm not intolerant to gluten, but I do keep an eye out for healthy snack foods. These oat raisin walnut spice bars have an unusual consistency, rather like fruit cake, but they sure taste better than fruitcake! They're not overly sweet, and it's actually possible to detect the flavors of oats, raisins, walnuts, and spice (mainly cinnamon), and they go well with a nice, hot cup of tea.

review/summary: Better than junk food but not a regular snack item for me
review/text: Before I go into the thrashing of ingredients, I must admit these taste *really good*. They smell good too, when you first open them. Like actual oatmeal raisin cookies! The texture is nice and soft, with a walnut crunch. These are higher quality bars than most. Unlike most snack bars, they don't leave an unpleasant taste in your mouth afterwards. I do not like oatmeal raisin cookies, but I did enjoy eating one of these bars for testing. I actually ate the entire thing and was surprised at what a quality product it was. (Heated in the microwave--out of the wrapper-for a few seconds, it was almost like a cookie straight out of the oven!)<br /><br />Having said that; they have 24 grams of carbohydrates per bar and 2 grams of fiber. I was surprised that they only had 9 g of sugars considering the second ingredient (agave) is the equivalent to corn syrup. Yes yes I know, "It's natural!" But look and see how it's processed, it's no different. One has a health label and the other doesn't. For those watching their sugars, they are the same and should be noted.<br /><br />If you are on a gluten-free diet because of health reasons, you will really enjoy these bars! If you are gluten free and also sugar-free, these aren't going to be a regular item for you. If you want a delicious snack bar that tastes pretty close to homemade, and you don't label your eating style, then you will like these bars! One bar is filling and delicious. Soft raisins and crunchy walnuts, if you are going to buy ANY snack bars, these are worth the money over other grocery store products!

review/summary: Decide for yourself if these are right for you...
review/text: Pamela's products have a long gluten free history and some are better than others like everything else. The reviews here run the gammut from great to disappointing. Too often I think people don't manage there expectations when they are buying a product where all the nutrional information is available. These bars are what they are, don't buy them if you want something vegan or low in sugar. Based on what's in the bar they're an ok, relatively healthy snack. My kids eat them if they're hungry but would likely reach for something less healthy given a choice. These aren't supermarket snack bars, I and they can deal with that. They're not hand baked by elves either. Check out the nutritional info provided and move along if they're not what you're looking for...

review/summary: Not a hit with our family
review/text: Within our family, my husband has diabetic neuropathy, one of us is a vegetarian(that would be me), and one of us is a Vegan.<br />This product might please others, who are not so particular, or who have different taste buds, but here is how it went with us: 1) My huaband thought they tasted "horrible". 2) I didn't think the colorie count and ingredients were worth incorporating into my diet daily or otherwise, and 3)my Vegan son could not even try them because, although they are touted as healthy, due to a few ingredients which were not necessary to add, they are NOT Vegan. Come on, even some varieties of Pop Tarts are Vegan at this point, not that I am saying Pop Tarts are the way to go.<br />Just my thoughts.<br />Incidentally, one of my children with autism took one look at the packaging and threw the bar and the package away. He is non verbal, but I count that as 4)one more opinion, possibly more of an aethestic nature, to take note of.<br />Sorry, Pamela's Products Whenever Bars in Oatmeal Raisin Spice...you sounded nifty but you just were not our cup of tea. Improvements could be made I bet!

review/summary: Back to the Gluten-Free Drawing Board
review/text: Pamela's cookies have long been the gold-standard for gluten-free treats and their chocolate-y goodness has gotten me through many a sad gluten-free day. When I saw these bars I snatched them up: sometimes you want a snack and a girl can eat only so many cookies and still keep her figure. Sadly, these tasteless, not-very-good-for-you bars fall short of the mark.<br /><br />TASTE: Blah. Sort of a raisin-studded sawdust is how I would describe it.<br /><br />NUTRITION: Also blah. There's some token chia, but the fiber, vitamin and mineral content is lacking. Plus the calorie count is high for such a tiny bar.<br /><br />THE SUGGESTED REMEDY: More spice (a tad more nutmeg and a dash of cardamon perhaps), swap out the raisins for cherries, increase the size of the bar and more fiber please.<br /><br />THE GRADE: C-<br /><br />It ain't worth the price my fellow gluten-freers. The search continues!

review/summary: Yeah they taste good, but for the money, size matters.
review/text: Wheat-free! Gluten-free! Non-dairy! Right off the bat, these bars sound like they're some pretty healthy snacks, and who can resist the taste of raisins and walnuts? I opened my box as soon as I got it in the mail, and upon opening the pack...was disappointed. These things are tiny! They're about the size of your standard credit card or driver's license, and gone in two bites. If you've ever had the Grandma's Cookies from a vending machine, they're just a little smaller than those, and taste similar to the oatmeal raisin ones, only these have walnuts.<br /><br />Sure these taste really good, but when you look at the nutrition values, it's hard to justify spending so much for a box of 6 of these, especially when there are better snack options out there. 190 calories? Ugh. 15mg of cholesterol? Ouch. I've had protein bars with much more nutrition, and less calories, that cost a fraction of what these do. I guess the key selling point of these Whenever bars is that they're non-dairy and gluten-free, but these seem like yet another product to jump on the 'healthy' bandwagon, with an inflated price.

review/summary: Tasty, but with Too Many Negatives
review/text: As a sufferer of Celiac Disease, I'm always looking for a gluten free snack.  Pamela's products are often a good choice for me.  These Oat Raisin Walnut Spice "Whenever Bars" provide a "gluten free, wheat free, dairy free" snack made with whole grains and sweetened with agave and coconut.  They are surprising nutty, a real bonus, nor do they skimp on the raisins--not so much a bonus to my palette, but they are large and whole so that I could pick them out easily.  These bars are also highly spicy, which I found pleasant, but which might be a problem for some people.  Over all, for me, the taste was very good, and the texture did not have the sandy feel often found in gluten free sweets.  Taste and texture both rate five stars<br /><br />On the negative size is the combination of price, size and carbs.  The latter is a personal preference, and not one that everyone will worry about.  As a Type 2 Diabetic, I have to eat carbs responsibly, and the 24 grams of carbs in this small bar (balanced by only 2 grams of protein and 2 grams of dietary fiber) does not make it worth it for me.<br /><br />The size and price elements will, I think, effect every consumer.  They are considerably smaller than other snack bars and at an average of just under $4 for a box of 5 bars, considerably more expensive.  I would recommend LARAbars as an overall better alternative.

review/summary: pleasantly surprised, for "gluten free"!
review/text: I have tried many gluten-free products, and many are dry, dense, or not that appetizing.  Therefore I didn't expect much from these, but I needed some emergency rations for a trip.  I was really surprised at how much they tasted like a soft, moist oatmeal cookie!  I found them delicious.  I would not say it is particularly healthy, given how much fat (9 g), calories (180) and sugars (9g) are in a "bar" that is pretty much the size of a cookie, but for those of us who need a safe snack on-the-go or a makeshift breakfast, I recommend these for flavor.  2g protein, 2g fiber, 24g carbohydrate.  Not vegan (contain eggs) but dairy-free (processed on equipment that also makes products containing milk among other allergens, but doesn't list wheat/gluten as a possible contaminant).

If you didn't know they were good for you, you would swear they were a homemade treat full of fat and sugar. With only 180 calories a bar, you can't go wrong with these tasty treats.

Ever since I bought the first boxes as a Gold Box deal, they will not touch the other bars (Oskri's Turkish Delight & Cashew bars and Cascadian Farms Fruit & Nut bars - I had bought lots as they were going through them regularly). The other bars are great, but these are in a whole different class - they are like eating the best oatmeal raisin cookie ever (the only thing that would make them even better would be fresh from the oven!).<br />The price is excellent and these are so healthy that I am happy to buy as many as the family will eat. I have not tried the other Pamela's products, but would venture to guess that they are equally as wonderful.

review/text: I like that you can eat these bars without immediately feeling that you need to drink something. They are moister than most energy bars I've tried and the walnuts add a great flavor and crunch. The sweetness level seems right too (9 out of 40 grams). The packaging is a bit misleading as the bar itself is only a bit more than half the length of the pouch. All in all a tasty morsel especially if you like walnuts.

review/summary: Delicious bars - soft, chewy and great flavor
review/text: Having tried almost every type of bar for portable meals or snacks, I was quite pleasantly surprised at how tasty and delicious these Whenever Bars are. I tried the Oat Raisin Walnut Spice and the bars are studded with goodies and nicely spiced. I went back for seconds the first time I tried them. Traditional granola bars are sometimes too hard to chew or too sugary or seem to have mysterious filler ingredients. It's easy to see what's in these bars. If you like a chewy oatmeal cookie type consistency, you'll like these, too! Highly recommend. They are not as big and dense as the Quaker chewy breakfast bars, but are a very nice size and easy to eat. These bars are on my shopping list now!

These bars have no glueten (wheat) in them, so it fills the needs of this group of people. (Although they are not vegetarian/vegan)<br /><br />As for the important taste and texture, these bars excell.  While most snack bars tend to be dense and heavy, these do not sit in your stomach like a lead ball.  They are not light a fluffy, they are what I would call substantial.

review/summary: Very moist
review/text: Eating these, I felt much more like I was enjoying a nicely balanced cookie instead of a healthy bar-type snack. With other brand bars, I often find them too chewy (too many oats, etc) and a little too hard. These had a nice balance of ingredients so it's more like biting into a cookie instead of a granola bar. Not too chewy, not too dense, good flavor. The only issue for me is it comes out of the package a little too moist. It felt like biting into a somewhat soggy cookie, or a cookie that had briefly fallen in a glass of water and left for a few hours to dry. It was moister than any other packaged cookie or bar that I've tried. That was a major turnoff for me, but two family members I shared this product with made no mention of that and rather enjoyed these bars and their level of moistness very much, so it might just be me.

See the photo we uploaded...straight from the package, one corner was bent easily, while another broke in pieces.<br /><br />However, besides being tasty, these Whenever Bars are gladly wheat-free, non-dairy, and offer nutrients that most cookies lack.

review/summary: A good cookie, not a good snack bar.
review/text: I used to have to eat gluten-free because of a histamine reaction I got from consuming wheat, I always enjoyed Pamela's Products to help make it easier to eat happy.  I am sad to say that this bar is a huge let down: very small, too low in fiber and protein, and very high in calories for its size.<br /><br />I understand that gluten-free food is not going to taste the same as their wheat-filled counterparts, but this really missed the mark.  With almost 200 calories, it should contain more protein and fiber than it does.  Add to its disappointing nutrition numbers its texture, so gummy and sticky that it is not enjoyable or convenient.  You will need a sink or wet nap for your hands afterwards.  I think I would wave away much of my scrutiny if this was just marketed as an extra chewy cookie, since that is what it is. The marketing copy I saw when ordering this off Amazon Vine was "A Satisfying Snack Food WHENEVER you want!"  I think that is a bit misleading since its stats are very close to most the Pamela's Cookies, the PB cookies even have more protein that these Whenever Bars.  As a healthy sweet treat, these are fine, as a nutritious snack between meals -- I will pass.

review/summary: Deceptively Filling!
review/text: Pamela's "Whenever Bars: Oat Raisin Walnut Spice" taste just like an oatmeal-raisin cookie and are deceptively filling for their small size.  In fact, the first time I had one, I scarfed it right down and probably didn't even chew enough, so I chased it with a second, along with a cup of coffee, and in about five minutes after everything got in my stomach, I felt like I'd eaten a plate of big pancakes.  So that was the wrong way to go about enjoying a Whenever Bar.  If you chew properly instead of eating as though you're a starving mastiff, ONE Whenever Bar is enough for one "sitting."  And these are a good option for when you're out and about, to keep your hands out of the candy bars or cookies at your nearest gas station.  You get some nutrition in return for your calories with these, instead of filling your internal gas tank with sugar and fat.  And like I said, they taste just like a regular oatmeal-raisin cookie, so it feels like you're being really indulgent, with these bars.

Delicious!<br />3. Healthy ingredients (e.g., w/o strange additives)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. A lot of calories in that one cookie (190). Though I think that is typical of similar snack products.<br /><br />For me, these are primarily in the same food niche as LaraBars, a snack for when I don't have time for a proper meal. LaraBars have an even shorter ingredient list, but they have the strange gooey consistency. (They are roughly the same in calories.)<br /><br />I will get these again -- they're a tasty and healthy snack.

review/summary: Taste like there home made
review/text: I have tried just about every Energy bar, and by far this is the tastiest.<br />That said, this is not called a Energy Bar.<br /><br />I guess there a tasty healthy little bar. If your hungry and on the go, and need to grab something that is healthy this is it.<br /><br />There NOY dry, and these are not ground up cardboard seeds, as most of the other bars are.<br />The nuts seem to be whole. I taste allot of whole Walnuts,raisins in these etc.<br />Its not hard on your teeth.<br /><br />The only draw back that I don't like is, there is Organic "Agave" in it, as the 3rd ing.<br />A while ago Agave was sold to us that it was a healthy type of sugar.<br />From what I have been reading, it is the same as , High fruitose corn syrup!Which I do not eat.<br />Maybe someone else here knows more about it then I do!<br /><br />As I said I don't like the idea there is Agave in this (although better then Soy). If there was not any, I would,and still might buy these to keep in my Car/ Purse.<br />They are good, and are Healthy, and look pretty much like the picture on the box.<br />These are not huge, but I think there satisifing, and filled me up.

review/summary: Tasty but TINY, and wish they'd lose the agave!
review/text: Agave is hyped up to be this great sweetener, but actually simply coconut sugar would be a much better choice.  Anyway, this had a flavor very reminiscent of oatmeal cookies, and I did enjoy one with a cup of coffee for the first taste test.  Next time I packed one in my purse, and I liked it but not as much without the coffee to help wash it down.  They are quite small for the price and calories.  Unfortunately, anything gluten-free seems to get an inflated price these days.  I hope in the future that trend will reverse.

review/summary: Taste great, not much nutritional value
review/text: Pamela's Whenever Oat Raisin Walnut Spice Bars taste great, but make sure to check the nutritional facts if you like to watch what you eat:<br />Calories 190<br />Calories from fat 80<br />Total Fat 9g (13%)<br />- Saturated Fat 1.5g (8%)<br />Cholesterol 15mg (6%)<br />Sodium 140mg (6%)<br />Total Carbohydrate 24g (8%)<br />- Dietary Fiber 2g (10%)<br />- Sugars 9g<br />Protein 2g<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 4%<br /><br />The bars tasted great and weren't dry at all.  In fact, they reminded me more of chewy cookies or cereal bars.  They're pretty dense and I found them to be a pretty good size for a quick snack.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend them because I liked the taste and that they don't contain high fructose corn syrup.  However, they don't pack much in terms of vitamins or minerals so these would be more for quick pick-me-up snacks rather than meal alternatives.

review/summary: Tasty Healthy Bar
review/text: These bars, to me, taste like a moist, soft oatmeal cookie. Oats, raisins, nuts, and a nice spice note. Considering all the things they're not (wheat free, gluten free, non-dairy) these are really tasty. Many of the moist healthy bars I've tried are really sticky, but not these. For me they're not too sticky, and just the right amount of chewiness and sweetness. The added chia seeds were a bit of a distraction, but not enough to ruin the experience. Overall, I like them well enough to purchase them, and at less than 80 cents per bar, a not too extravagant treat.

review/text: These bars taste very good, like oatmeal raisin cookies.  My two toddlers also loved the bar, which is not all that surprising because it is very sweet (and a little sticky).  While gluten-free, be forewarned that it does contain eggs so it's not safe for all allergies.

review/summary: More like cookies than bars, and a great option if you want a non-dairy snack
review/text: Whether looking for a non-dairy and gluten-free snack, or just simply something more on the  healthy side to feed the kids, Pamela's Whenever Bars are a filling and flavorful option.  The overall flavor and texture actually seem more like a homemade cookie than a "whenever bar."  The ingredient list also has several interesting additions you won't find in many other snack bars, such as chia seeds and even agave.<br /><br />An unfortunate problem with the average non-dairy snack is dealing with a dry texture or a lack of sweet flavor.  There's no question that Pamela's Whenever Bars are less moist than a gooey bakery cookie or a chocolate bar, but they aren't overly dry and have a pleasant texture.  Picky kids might complain about the difference, but it's not a huge deal and the raisin walnut flavor more than makes up for it.<br /><br />While there are better tasting non-dairy baked goods, there is also a fair share of less appetizing ones to be found out there.  With the health benefits of whole grains and Omega 3, as well as a nice fruit and nut flavor, the whenever bars hit the spot as long as you can enjoy the texture.

review/text: I don't actually eat gluten free or diary free, but I loved these.  They weren't that sweet, actually pretty spicy and chock full of nuts and fruit.  They had a great texture as well.  Slightly chewy, but mostly soft.  I had one in the morning and it did a pretty good job of keeping me full for a while.  Nice wholesome ingredients as well.  I can't say I'd buy them considering I don't need the gluten-free and they are pricey, but they were very good.

review/summary: it's ok I guess
review/text: I liked the texture and appearance of the bar - you can totally see: oh , this is an oat, here is my raisin, this is a walnut. I like when you can tell what is in the bar by just looking on it. It makes it look more of a homemade. The shape is also more just like a cookie dough kind of thing. I looks like somebody took a piece out of a huge dough ball, shaped it into a hot dog bun between their hands and flattened it by slapping it on a counter. It tastes fine - nice to see a new nut used in granola bars. They are also very moist. However main disappointment is the size. It is more like a kid size snack with adult calories in it - 180cal, 9 g of sugar and fat. It is ok on sodium - 140mg. I also wish it did not hav eggs or xanthan gum. This product is not vegan. And I think all the syrup and raising could have made it chewy enough - no need to weird ingredients. I would not have paid 75cents for the bar. It is somewhat small for the calories and I am against too many ingredients in it, even though they market it as a health food with their chia seed and such.

review/summary: Very tasty gluten free bars - just a little dry
review/text: I'm always searching for great gluten free products for my wife. Pamela's bakery always has a great selection, so I jumped on these bars right away.<br /><br />These bars are chewy (akin to Clif bars), nutty, and really tasty. They're quite satisfying, and have 190 calories. They are a bit on the dry side, so you will need to have a glass of water nearby.<br /><br />The first few ingredients are:<br />gluten-free oats, organic agave, rice blend, coconut sugar, and raisins. For those with other food allergies, these bars contain eggs, coconut, and walnuts. They are processed on equipment that also makes products with peanuts, soy, and milk.

review/summary: (Gluten-Dairy-Wheat free) COOKIES & the FACTS OF LIFE
review/text: Sometimes, you need a cookie. Not a protein bar, or seaweed with pumpkin seeds, but a grandma type cookie. Thats just a fact of life for most folks. And, if you cant eat dairy, Wheat, or the gluten from various grains due to allergies, then you will be deprived your cookie. Unless you want to buy a ton of items from the health food store, and make your comfort food. That is, if you have time. But, if you dont have time, splurge on some PAMELA'S OAT RAISIN WALNUT SPICE "bars". (hey, they're oblong cookies.) ITs a soft, mildly sweet, chewy cookie with great texture and rich taste. These anytime snacks are filled up with every good, expensive ingredient you can imagine, and some you probibly cant. (These are sweetened with coconut sugar. I didnt know there was coconut sugar out there. WOW.) Made from Gluten free Oats, Agave,(sweetener) Rice flour, Coconut sugar, raisins, safflower oil, Eggs, Walnuts, coconut, Chia Seeds, Vanilla flavor and spices, sea salt, and Aluminum Free Baking Powder, with everything Organic that can be, and as healthy as a cookie can be. THESE TASTE FANTASTIC! Each box has 6 cookies, individually wrapped in aluminum. OKAY, they each have 180 calories, so you shouldnt gobble down the box. However, when you have something this tasty and special, its best to "sip" the cookie like fine wine. So, if you are looking for some good treats, and you have food alergies, these "whenever bars" will satisfy that little fact of life we all understand. Sometimes, you just need a cookie.

review/summary: Satisfying but pricy
review/text: This product is a satisfying snack. Does tastes a bit like oatmeal cookies but sweetened by raisins, agave & coconut sugar, not cane sugar. I think it would taste even better with more walnuts but that would probably increase the calories. Honestly, I didn't find one walnut in my first bar and was shocked to learn that walnuts were even a listed ingredient!<br /><br />I liked it but probably won't repurchase. Each bar is about 1.4 ounces, which seems to me to be a small amount for the cost ... and the calories!

review/summary: Convenient treat that tastes excellent and has wholesome ingredients, YUMMO!
review/text: This is a snack that has wholesome ingredients and can satisfy that "sweet tooth" we all get sometimes.<br />I am not a fan of granola, it is too syrupy sweet and I don't like chewing the hard oats, and feeling like Secretariat (the horse) instead of a secretary at my desk at work! Try answering the phone with a mouthfull of granola bar, it isn't pretty, trust me.<br />The first bite just reminded me of fall flavors, and I thought the BEST complement to this bar would be a fresh glass of fresh pressed apple cider!<br />The spices are spot on.<br />AND, they are soft with a good texture, easy to chew and easy on the dental work, unlike sticky hard TOO CHEWY granola bars.<br />This bar is Wheat free, Gluten free, and dairy free.<br />IT IS NOT a low calorie bar, however at 180 calories and 9 grams of fat (0 trans, 1.5g Saturated) this bar is still TONS better health wise than say, a piece of pumpkin pie or ginger spice cookies. Which are TWO of the treats I could do without if I got a craving for them and had this bar!<br />This is a PRODUCT OF THE USA! I'll briefly list nutrition:<br />Calories 180<br />Fat 9 g (1.5g sat, 0 trans)<br />CHOL  15mg<br />Sodium 140mg<br />Total carbs 24g  (Dietary fiber 2g, Sugars 9g)<br />Protein 2g<br />There aren't any nutrients listed that are more than 4% Daily values--so I am not bothering to list them, they are negligible)<br />Ingredients: Gluten free oats, Organic Agave, Rice Blend (Brown rice flour, white rice flour, tapioca starch, sweet rice flour, Xanthan gum) Coconut sugar, Raisins, monounsaturated safflower oil, organic eggs, walnuts, coconut, chia seeds, natural vanilla flafor, spices, baking soda, sea salt, Xanthan Gum, Grainless and aluminum bree baking powder (sodium bicarbonate, sodium acid pyrophosphate, potato starch)<br />Allergy information: Contains Egg, Coconut, and Walnut, Processed on equipment that also makes products containing peanuts, other tree nuts, soy, and milk.<br /><br />I found these handy bars were great for an on the go healthy snack that kept me away from other unhealthier alternatives. I can highly recommend these as a yummy treat, and I will buy them again!

review/summary: Pleasing taste.  Texture just so-so.
review/text: I'll start with the nutritional/health aspect.  This 1.41 Oz snack is filling at 180 calories.  Not much nutritional value (2% DV calcium, 4% DV iron).  High fiber, moderate sodium (140mg).  Not a lot of sugar (9g).  In all . . . probably not good couch food, but is a filling compact snack when on the go and you need a lift, or maybe for the mini-breakfast eater.<br /><br />The texture issue:  somewhat sticky/gooey/pastey, with a wee bit of crumbling when attacked.  None of it excessive.<br /><br />Flavor is quite good.  I particularly enjoyed the large identifiable walnut pieces, rather than the micro-specs you get in some snack bars. I don't care for raisins (they are in there), but they are soft and whole if you like them.  The spice taste was pleasantly muted and there was a remote banana flavor (maybe the agave,coconut sweetening?).  Yummy.<br /><br />The texture issue aside (which I suspect had to do with the high fiber content) -  I'll give this filling, good-tasting, and reasonably healthy snack a full 5 stars.

review/text: I thought Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut Spice bars were tasty. They were chewy with a hint of sweetness. The spice flavor tasted like cinnamon and nutmeg to me. I had one with my coffee for breakfast and I wasn't hungry again until lunch time. These would make a great quick breakfast or snack for when you're on the go. They appear to be healthy too - sweetened with agave and only 190 calories per bar. The fat content does seem a little high though at 9 grams per bar. Overall I would recommend trying them.<br /><br />The allergy information on my box was: Contains eggs, coconut and walnuts. Processed on equipment that also makes products containing peanuts, other tree nuts, soy and milk.

review/text: These bars are made with ingredients that provide a healthy bang for the caloric buck.  Potential allergens are listed in bold on the package and easy to spot. I like that they are wheat-free, gluten-free, and non-dairy; also that they are not sweetened with refined sugar. I found them moist and tasty with a nice aroma and no weird aftertaste. They taste a bit like an oatmeal-raisin cookie with raisins that are especially moist and chewy.  I found them better than the oatmeal-raisin Clif bars. I liked the stronger spice flavors and the addition of walnuts.<br /><br />I will probably buy these when I need a pick-me-up.<br /><br />Con:  They do contain egg so may not be suitable for some vegetarians.

review/summary: High Calorie Small Snack
review/text: I have been purchasing and trying all sort of energy bars, fiber bars and snack bars for some time. I have no special dietary needs, but if I had to maintain a gluten free diet, then this Whenever Bar would be of greater interest to me. But, at 180 calories in a 1.41 ounce snack bar and only 24g or 8% DV of dietary fiber, there are better and less expensive bars on the market from which those on no food restrictions may choose. The mouth feel was moist and chewy as advertised, but the flavor was not memorable.  On the plus side, this bar did not contain high fructose corn syrup or artificial sweetener. And, it has only 6% DV of cholesterol and of salt. So, bottom line, those on gluten restricted diets may well wish to try this bar. Energy bars are very handy for travel. Nice to have when you get stuck in an airport or have a late arrival and all the food places are closed. But, whereas these bars cost close to $4.00 each, it is possible to buy other brands of healthy bars at a quarter the price. So, thanks to small size, high cost, non memorable taste and high calorie count, I ended up rating these a two star.

I was a little hesitant after reading the description on these bars, "Wheat-free, Gluten-free, and Non-dairy", since most of the times these types of bars don't taste very good.  I was very pleasently surprised after the first bit.  They bar was so moist and the raisins very plump! They def. filled me up for my mid-morning snack.  The spice in them was just right and everything tasted so good together.  I like that it is low in sugar and packed with whole grains which keep you fuller longer. Can't wait to start giving these to my 3 year old.

The taste is, in fact, very natural -almost, if not exactly like, home made. The are very moist,and chewy, too. On the downside, there are not many in the box and the bars themselves are rather small. I found myself liking these bars the more I ate and will definitely buy them at the store as long as they are not too expensive.

review/summary: oat raisin walnut whenever bars
review/text: I opened the box, took out one of the bars, and was surprised at how large the packaging was compared to the size of the actual snack.  It didn't look appetizing at all, and appeared to have been shoved in the wrapper haphazardly.<br /><br />I tried a bite, and was pleasantly surprised at the chewy texture and the flavor.  Also, not having dairy, gluten or soy is a big plus.  The big drawback is that they are rather heavy, and I could only eat about 1/2 the bar (no wonder they are so small).  I think that as a meal replacement, the whole bar would be fine, but as a snack, they might be too much.<br /><br />Overall, this was an okay product.  I would buy it again in the future, but not on a regular basis.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because it did have a nice flavor, and works for just about any food allergy...

I'll compare these to two other kinds of snack bar I recently purchased: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTGAUM">Nature's Path Organic Granola Bars, Peanut Choco', 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMQFY4">Nature Valley Chewy Trail Mix Bars, Fruit & Nut, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>.<br />NUTRITIONAL COMPARISON<br />The Whenever Bars list a 40 gram serving size with 190 calories, 80 of them from fat, 9g fat, 1.5g saturated fat, 15mg cholesterol, 140mg sodium, 24g total carbs, 2g fiber, 9g sugars, 2g protein.<br />Nature's Path Peanut Choco bars list 35g serving, 150 calories, 50 from fat, 6g fat, 1.5g saturated fat, 0 cholesterol, 125mg sodium, 80mg potassium, 22g carbs, 2g fiber, 11g sugars, 3g protein.<br />The Nature's Valley bar also has a 35g serving size, 140 calories, 35 of them from fat, 4g total fat, .5g saturated fat, 0 cholesterol, 65mg sodium, 25g carbs, 2g fiber, 13g sugars, 3g protein.<br />None of these bars contains trans fats. Adjusted for size, the Whenever Bar is higher than the others in calories, calories from fat, cholesterol. Nature's Valley is the sodium winner (lowest) and carbs (highest). The Nature's Path and Nature's Valley bars deliver 177% of the Whenever Bar's protein content, again on a comparable weight basis.<br />EATING COMPARISON<br />Each of these bars delivers a distinct eating experience. The Whenever Bar is soft, a bit like a soft-baked cookie. It's a little dry and slightly crumbly. Mind you these traits are not overwhelming and did not bother me at all. The flavor is fine.<br />The Peanut Choco bar is gooey and denser than the Whenever Bar, and seems much sweeter.<br />The Fruit & Nut Trail mix bar is very dense, chewy and nutty. You know that you're biting into something when you eat these.<br />Did I like the Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut Spice Whenever Bar? I did. Were I avoiding wheat, gluten or dairy, I'd welcome this option. Not having those issues to deal with, I consider it a viable alternative to the other snack bars I enjoy.

review/summary: "Healthy" cookie, anyone?
review/text: Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut Spice bars are a viable alternative to granola bars - if you're tired of the crunchy, stick-to-your-teeth bars, you can alternate with these soft stick-to-your-teeth cookies.<br /><br />On the nutrition/calorie front, Pamela's bars are wheat, gluten, and dairy free, and they contain no trans fats.  One cookie has 140mg of sodium (6% of the `allowable' daily amount).  At 190 calories each, they're similar if slightly higher in calories than most granola bars.  Their Cholesterol (15 mg), total fat (9 g), and carbs (24g) put them in the snack class for my family.  This is dessert, not good nutrition.<br /><br />I did find the cookies to be more like a homemade soft cookie than a granola bar and that was a pleasant change.  Although, at least for me, they cried out for an accompanying glass of milk.  Perhaps they're a tad dry?<br /><br />I did have a relatively strong gastro reaction to the cookie.  I doubt that you want to know more about that.  Suffice it say, if you're at all grain sensitive, don't try these for the first time when you're away from home.<br /><br />The bottom line:  Three stars.  Another entry into the `healthy' snack category that's adequate but fails to stand out.

review/summary: Amazingly Like My Grandma Used to Make
review/text: Before eating my first "Pamela's Gluten-free Whenever Bar; Oat Raisin Walnut Spice," I was mentally preparing to provide a list of all the technical details I would be listing in my review.  Then I had a bite.<br /><br />These odd little "bars" (its not really a bar, since it lacks a defined rectangular shape) taste just like my Grandmother's ginger cookies.  Everything else I would have said pales in comparison.  Basically, if you taste like grandma used to make, that sort of trumps everything else, and you get five stars.<br /><br />Warning: They taste really good, and knowing that you are eating something carefully designed to be very healthy and organic, its tempting to have more that the two I have budgeted for lunch today.<br /><br />The first one had a huge piece of walnut in the end.  The second one was heavy on raisins.  Each one appears to have its own character, as if they are made in small, individual batches.  List of ingredients on the side:  Gluten-free oats, organic agave, rice blend (mostly brown rice flour), coconut sugar, raisins, mono-saturated safflower oil, organic eggs, walnuts, coconut, chic seeds, natural vanilla, spices, baking soda, sea salt, xanthan gum, grainless and aluminum free baking powder.<br /><br />I have to admit I'm a big gluten fan.  Sometimes I bake bread on weekends and I knead the dough by hands.  I love stretching it out into thin films and I can literally manipulate the gluten to maximize the chewy texture in the resulting loaf.  But 1% or so of the world's population suffers from an abnormal immune reaction to partially digested gliadin. For those folks, this kind of product is a great alternative to traditional carbohydrates.<br /><br />But for folks who don't have a problem with gluten like me, this a very high quality, great tasting convenience food.

review/summary: Definitely tasty, but not my favorite.
review/text: I will start off by saying that our household has no need for gluten-free products, but I'm always willing to try something new. That said, we've tried a few random gluten-free products, and these are actually pretty tasty. They kinda tasted like a spiced oatmeal cookie or a spiced carrot cake, except I am not big "spice" fan and the ingredient list just said "spices" so I couldn't pinpoint which spice it was that I didn't love. But my husband ate them and liked them AND my toddler ate them and liked them (though I've found he isn't terribly picky when it comes to granola bars) and I would eat it if they were all we had, but that strange spice flavor knocked them out of contention for me. But overall I'd give them a strong four stars.

review/text: Each bar contains a full day's ration of carbohydrates, which makes it a bit hard to get thru the rest of the day without getting too much carbohydrate.  My wife, my son who happened to be with us, and I could easily and happily eat several every day if they weren't such diet-busters.  For those of you who can handle more carbohydrate, we would heartily recommend them.

review/summary: Hard to Stop Eating Them!
review/text: Pamela's Whenever Bars (Oat Raisin Walnut Spice) are awesome! I put the box in my car so I could snack on the go. They are hard to stop eating. These bars are like a mini spice cake. I love the moistness and the wonderful textures. It is hard to believe these are healthy for you, but they are (at the recommended serving size). For 140 calories per bar, these really fill me up until my next meal. These is great for those with allergies, but they do contain nuts. Thankfully, I am not allergic to nuts. I will defintiely be buying some more!

review/text: The first one of these I tried was pretty dry, I did not like it. The second one was moist and chewy, as were the rest. I guess the first one must not have been sealed! These had a good flavor and were pretty satisfying as a breakfast (I tend to eat a light breakfast). They have plenty of nuts in them, and the flavor is great. Several reviews state that the bar is very small, I thought it was plenty big enough, the wrapper fits very loose though so it may lead you to believe that the bar would be larger. I would purchase again.

review/text: I liek these small bars.  They are rich and dense as well as tasty, although perhaps a bit too rich for more than one at a time. Not too large, I was glad to eat it guilt-free as I am on a medical diet; one bar did not violate my daily intake.  The price is high, but they are good.

review/summary: A tasty and nutritious snack for people on the go
review/text: One of the best aspects of these bars is that they are soft and easy to chew without easily falling to pieces. The prime consequence of this characteristic is that the flavor comes out immediately when you take a bite. It also makes them easy to consume while on the go. As a lover of walnuts and raisins, these two ingredients make it very tasty for me and the other ingredients make it a very healthy food, suitable for almost all diets.<br /> A company called Pamela's Products makes the bars and the company donates to Celiac Spine and Autism organizations, another valuable point to consider when pondering the purchase of these tasty treats.

review/summary: Yummy, Feel-Good Snack
review/text: Yum! If you want a granola bar without loads of sugar and high fructose corn syrup, this is a good choice. These bars are not overly sweet. I found the flavor very satisfying -- plenty of oats and nuts in the taste. There are also little cripsy bits of rice in the mix, making this bar full of textures -- crispy, crunchy, and chewy.  They are a cross between an oatmeal raising cookie and a chewy granola bar. Very, very yummy without the overpowering flavor of preservatives that is in most store bought goods.<br /><br />Aside from the rice, they actually taste like something I would make from scratch. They even look homemade, too.<br /><br />These bars are about three inches long and two inches wide. They are shaped naturally, like a human made them rather than a machine cut them into a strict rectangle. (They probably are made by machine, but I did notice the more homemade appearance when I opened the package. It all gave me a nice, healthy feeling as I ate them.)

review/summary: Very Tasty and Good For You
review/text: The Oat Raisin Walnut Spice Whenever Bars were really good for not being something totally yummy like a Cadbury's Chocolate Bar. The taste is a mix of a sweetened bowl of oatmeal and an oatmeal cookie. It's too soft to be a cookie, but too formed to be a bowl of oat meal, if that makes sense. The ingredients are wholesome with oaks, agave, rice flours, tapioca, safflower oil, xanthan gum, raisins, sun flower seeds, coconut oil, sea salt, baking powder (grain and aluminum free, no less)and potato starch. It's not low in the calorie department with 190 calories a bar and 9 grams of fat. It also has 24 grams of carbs and 2 grams of fiber for those watching their carb counts. And it gives you a 2 grams of protein. For a gluten-free, wheat-Free, non-dairy snack, it's not bad at all. It should be a big hit for the Vegan/wholesome food crowd (of which I'm not).<br /><br />However, this is a tad pricey. At $23 for a 6 pack of 5 bars each, that comes out to $3.83 a box or .76 a bar. This comes out a little too high for my family's food budget.

review/text: Oatmeal cookie anyone? This Whenever Bar is gluten-free, wheat-free etc. etc. It all boils down to "it's good for you." The packaging is not so good for you with the individually wrapped bars. Surely a company so dedicated to healthy food can also be a bit more environmentally conscious.<br /><br />But the bar itself was tasty. It's very soft. Almost too soft really. When I read "bar", my mind assumes there will be some barness to the thing. This was very soft. I think my expectations would have been different if it was a Whenever Cookie.<br /><br />It smells and tastes like an oatmeal cookie. Loaded with raisins and walnuts, this bar made me feel like I was having a substantial snack. The fact that it is 180 calories in one bar with 9 grams of fat didn't feel all that healthy though.<br /><br />Overall, I have mixed feelings about this bar. I mean, it does taste good. It does deliver on flavor. I'm just not convinced it is the healthiest snack available for my money and calorie count. I doubt I'd buy these unless I had someone coming over who needed gluten-free snacks available.

review/summary: Tastes Good - Healthy Too!
review/text: There are a lot of granola/snack bars available so I thought this might just be one more, but I was surprised. This reminds me of eating a moist oatmeal cookie only better because it is gluten free, low in cholesterol, lots of omega 3 fatty acids and a good source of fiber. Not only tasty, but healthy too. My wife has a gluten intolerance so these also work for her. These are my new favorite choice for a snack. Excuse me while I go get a glass of milk to go with Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut Spice bar. Highly recommended!!

review/summary: chewy oat, raison, walnut, spice bar
review/text: Not having been a fan of energy bars and such, I was surprised when I liked the flavor and texture of the Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut Spice bar. It is soft and chewy and seems like a human made it in a kitchen. I was pleased to see that organic eggs and agave were used as well as some other organic ingredients. It is not all organic but some of the foods that I feel are most important to be organic are included. And... no nasty chemical ingredients. It does not contain dairy, gluten or wheat which does not matter to me but I know is important to others. I should stress that this is not a crunchy, crumbly type bar. I don't like dry cereal either. It is soft, chewy and has good nut and raisin flavor. I not only recommend this but plan to order some more.

review/summary: Tastes good, but is not for someone on a diet
review/text: Nutrition -- If you're already saddled with Celiac disease or have dietary restrictions like me, you're already a label reader. I'm a bit concerned about some of the nutritional information about these bars. Nearly half the calories are from fat. And, the box calorie count was 10 points higher than the label on the individual bar (Pamela's should fix this discrepancy). I'd also be happier if they hadn't used eggs, because that would cut the cholesterol and some of the saturated fat. However, the bar packs a lot of fiber, which will fill you up if you're hiking or being active in general.<br /><br />Texture and shape -- The marketing team must have said that they needed to branch out from cookies. But, the reality is that these are NOT bars, they are cookies. Very similar to good homemade cookies, but cookies nonetheless. They don't have the texture of a granola bar or a protein bar, and aren't easily eaten as a bar because they are soft and flexible. I suppose if you refrigerated them, you could get more of a bar texture since they are a bit on the fatty side.<br /><br />Flavor -- I did not taste very much walnut, but I did encounter raisins and oats. They were sweet, but not overly, which was good. They reminded me of freshly baked oatmeal cookies, but lighter due to the rice flour. I liked the flavor, but wished for more walnuts. I could definitely taste the cinnamon.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say they might want to re-market it as a cookie, since expectations of bars are higher given that most are designed to be meal replacements.

review/summary: A snack bar that tastes like a cookie
review/text: These snack bars taste like moist oatmeal cookies.  These may be the best tasting snack bar I have ever tried (my husband seconds this).  The bars have a moist texture and they are low on crumbs which makes them a good choice for an afternoon snack at work.  There are a lot of healthy things hidden in these bars which is always a plus.  These contain chia seeds and walnuts, both which are very high in Omega-3 fatty acids (the currently very trendy heart healthy fatty acid).  These are also sweetened with coconut sugar which is considered a low glycemic index food.  Coconut sugar also contains a high amount of minerals and vitamins so this is one of the healthiest sugars for sweetening foods.  This is also sweetened with organic agave, which chemically is a very high fructose sweetener.  For me, this is the one down side to this product.  I try to avoid the use of fructose-based sweeteners, even when they cloak themselves as "trendy" alternatives to sugar.<br /><br />They are dairy-, gluten-, and wheat-free but they do contain eggs, walnuts, and coconuts.  They are also processed on equipment shared with peanuts, tree nuts, and soy so they are not suitable for many with food allergies.

What's even nicer is I can share these with my friends with gluten intolerance but frankly I don't think the box is going to last that long.<br /><br />I eat these straight out of the wrapper, keeping it in and pushing it along. No crumbs from these. I would not describe these as "chewy" but they are moist.

They also are processed on equipment that also makes products contain peanuts, other tree nuts, soy and milk, which can be an issue for people with other food allergies (outside of gluten).

review/summary: Other than the gluten-free texture, I love these bars
review/text: I don't have any food allergies, but I have some close friends who can't tolerate gluten, so I'm always on the lookout for gluten-free foods that I can recommend or provide at parties.  I've also been trying to commit to finding healthy snacks to keep at my desk at the office.  These bars are delicious, gluten-free, and a great size for a quick snack.  With organic ingredients, lots of fiber, and only 190 calories per bar, I can also feel like I'm doing something good for my body when I enjoy them.  I like that the box is made of recycled paper, that the cinnamon flavor really pushes through in each bite, and that the list of ingredients is made up of words that I can pronounce.  I only have one problem with the bars: the texture.  I know that without gluten, it is nearly impossible to create baked goods that behave like standard baked goods, and the bars do achieve a nice softness that feels good to chew.  Still, the bars don't hold together well at all.  I found that I needed to unwrap a bar and use the package as a napkin, otherwise, the poor thing would crumble apart.  I don't know that this is a problem that can be solved without gluten, but it does make the product less portable (with a regular oatmeal breakfast bar, you can chew on it while you drive to work or even while you walk to your car, but you really need to be focused to get the most out of this snack).  I certainly wouldn't avoid buying these bars just because of the texture - the taste really is delicious - but it's something that a buyer should know before unwrapping the first taste.<br /><br />These snacks are a real treat, and while they're not safe for every allergy (the name includes "walnut," after all), they're easily good enough to delight someone with a gluten intolerance, and people who can have gluten should even try them for their delicious taste.

review/text: This resembles a soft, chewy, coconutty oatmeal cookie.  I think "coconut" should be part of the description because it's sweetened with coconut as well as agave, and some folks don't like the taste of coconut (but I love it).  The bars were a hit with the rest of my family as well. As for the price, I'd say these are more comparable to Clif or Odwalla or other similar bars that typically are $1-2 apiece, than something like Quaker chewy granola bars, so I think they're competitively priced.

Hard to be a critic when it's so good. Pretty good for breakfast as a side to yoghurt and fruit. Or a great finish to a salad dinner when you want something a little sweet to round off a tart dressing. Nice pick-me-up for a mid-afternoon snack. The box is right...this is a "whenever" bar.

review/summary: Great for "Whenever" snacking
review/text: Special diet stuff? Then it's got to be yucky, right? NOT! These bars are quite tasty and I think my son summed it up best by describing them as gingersnaps crossed with an oatmeal walnut raisin cake. The bars are moist and chewy with walnuts and chia seeds to give it an added interesting texture.<br /><br />Three of us here in the household tried the bars. My husband didn't care for them because of the walnuts and seeds. He says he didn't like all that extra "work" to eat his snack bar. He isn't one for nuts in his snack foods, either, so... He gave it between 2-3 stars.<br /><br />My son ate all his and said it was OK, but he wouldn't go out and buy a box to have around to snack on. He gave it 3 stars.<br /><br />Me - well I thought they were really very good. I enjoyed that extra texture supplied by the chia seeds, and I love oatmeal, raisins, nuts and coconut in my snacks. I'm all about flavors and textures, and this one was a hit for me! I'm giving it 5 stars.<br /><br />Each box contains five 40g (1.41oz) bars. Each bar contains 190 calories of which 80 of them are from fat. Out of the 9g of fat (13%), 1.5g is saturated (8%) and contains no Tran Fat. Each also contains 140g of sodium, 9g sugar, and 2g dietary fiber.

review/text: YUM! YUM, YUM, YUM!<br /><br />Moist, soft, and spicy--the reviewer who described them as a sort of cake-cookie hybrid was right on.  Great texture.  Lovely molasses-y, spice cookie-like flavor.  I do find these sweet (not too sweet), but I don't have much of a sweet tooth and find most granola/snack bars on the market too sweet.  These are refreshingly different.<br /><br />They're under 200 calories per bar. For comparison purposes, there are around 110 calories and an estimated 3 grams fiber in a banana.  One large apple has around 100 calories and an estimated 4.5 grams fiber.  So these bars have a higher calorie count than fresh fruit, but also a higher fiber content and a 350 milligrams of Omega-3s.<br /><br />Bottom line: like any sweet food (including fruit) these should be consumed in moderation.  "Whenever" might need to be limited to one per day over several week days.  However, I certainly intend to continue consuming them as they are really delicious!

review/summary: Delicious and gluten-free oats is the first ingredient
review/text: These Oat Raisin Walnut Spice Whenever Bars are delicious to me.  They are the size of a thick medium cookie, are slightly chewy, and are very tasty despite the fact that they do not taste sweet at all.<br /><br />The first three ingredients in order are gluten-free oats, organic agave, and a rice blend.  As for the rest of the cookie's name raisins are the fifth ingredient, walnuts the eight, and spice the eleventh.  The cookie contains eggs and coconut as well. The package claims that you get 350 mg of Omega 3 Fatty Acids and 9 grams of fiber per bar.<br /><br />Each bar is high in calories and I don't know which calorie count is correct. According to the box, each cookie is 190 calories but the individual wrappers say 180 calories.  Both say 80 calories are from fat.  Nevertheless, these are certainly a better choice than a candy bar and since these are wheat and gluten free, they are a good snack for individuals with Autism or Celiac Disease.<br /><br />I really love the taste and texture of these bars.  I was going to share one with my boyfriend but now I'm not sure they'll be any left for him.

review/summary: Delicious, I think I just found a great snack!
review/text: These "Whenever Bars" are delicious and hearty.  They are Oat, raisin, walnut.  Bite into one and you experience something that is not quite cookie, and not quite cake ... kind of in between.  Chewy consistency, crunchy given the nuts.<br /><br />I love them.  They taste like pumpkin bread with the various spices.  I don't think that I could ask for a nicer snack.  Two of them with a coffee would make a great, hearty breakfast.<br /><br />Delicious. I want to order more but they are out of stock.  I guess the secret is out.  Yummy!

review/summary: Like it alot
review/text: When I asked what the main ingrediant in this product was I was told it was vinegar.  My grandmother used to use vinegar to clean fruits and it works great, but it has a strong smell and often that smell can stick to the surface of the fruit.  Fit has no unpleasant scent and it does a great job.  You can see how much more dirt comes off than when just using water.  Plus it's kosher which is a plus for the times when I have my 2 modern orthodox jewish friends and their kids over.<br /><br />One reviewer says the plastic bowl has BPA.  As someone who tries to avoid BPA plastics for anything that handles my food I tried to verify this.  The bottom of the white bowl has a 5 recycling number so it looks like this collander is BPA free.

review/summary: Nice for those who eat a lot of produce
review/text: We eat a lot of fresh produce, so I like to have this around. I fill up the bowl and use it over and over to wash all the produce that I've brought home from the store, or that I'm using that night. The bowl is a bit smaller than I had anticipated - I was expecting something closer in size to a standard colander, and it is quite a bit smaller than that. However, it's still generally plenty big enough for any one item I may be using, and it's easy enough to do a couple of batches.<br /><br />One other thing that my help to know is that the "jugs" are for use in the bowl, and you are supposed to use one full cap per bowl full of water. This means that the jug is used up fairly quickly if you use it every day, so it's good to be aware of that. It is pretty inexpensive, though - I just tend to use it when I know I'll be using it twice or more.  (On two or more bowls of veggies.)<br /><br />It isn't a must-have, but for people like us who do eat a lot of fresh foods, it is a nice extra bit of insurance.

No thanks.<br /><br />We used to get Fit in stores; the price always got higher and higher until they stopped selling it. Finding it on Amazon at a reasonable price is terrific.<br /><br />We swirl a few batches of food in a bowl of water with Fit. Avoid washing food you won't consume within a few days, since cleaning off the outer layer of any food can limit storage life.

review/summary: It's unbelievable how much gunk is on produce until you use this stuff!
review/text: I started using this stuff several years ago but its availability has been sporadic until I discovered it was being sold on Amazon and then I was thrilled!  Before I discovered this stuff I was using antibacterial dish washing soap to wash my produce and it always left a soapy residue and aftertaste.  This stuff leaves no aftertaste and removes more gunk than soap.  A couple of things about it.<br /><br />1. Use it when you are ready to consume your produce because it washes off those nasty preservatives in addition to the pesticides.  Once you wash off the preservatives the produce has about a 48-hour shelf life.<br /><br />2. This is really useful for those that actually eat the recommended amount of fruits and veggies everyday.  It's too expensive for those that eat the occasional tomato.<br /><br />The bowl and strainer are a nice little bonus but not really big enough to wash more than a pound of tomatoes or a couple of bunches of cilantro at a time.  Also, for people who scoff at the idea of being so anal about washing produce that you intend to consume raw, I once washed a head of romaine lettuce and found a tapeworm in the water.<br /><br />Happy washing!

review/text: Recently rediscovered this product after not having seen it in stores for years. Glad I did. I use it on a daily basis for all types of fruit and vegetables, does seem to help get the produce nice and clean. The strainer bowl is nice, I use it so often that it's nice to have a spare in case one is dirty or in case I am washing a large quantity of produce at once. It's nice to be able to sit the strainer of fruit into the light plastic bowl AFTER washing so that it can catch any drips of water from freshly washed fruit...I will often wash cherries or berries and take them to the table right in the strainer with bowl for the family to pick from. Also, I have one bowl that is many years old and it still looks just as good as the newer strainer set. Really like this product!

review/summary: Finally, the TASTE of Fresh Fruit, not the Waxes, Pesticides, Dirt and Bug & Bird Do !!!!
review/text: My family has allergies and ADD and we are trying to eliminate those triggers from our diet.<br /><br />I tried FIT, and could not believe how much junk was left in the bowl after rinsing!!!  I have searched for alternative products and methods for over 15 years - and there is no comparison.<br /><br />I have even read reports that plain water with a drop of Palmolive Dish washing liquid will clean just as well.  No way.  All you have to do to prove this is the best way to clean your fresh food is try this simple test:<br /><br />Pick grapes off the vine and drop them into the colander which is sitting in its bowl.  I find you can get a lot more miles out of the pouring bottle if instead of using a cap full as it recommends, if you use the sprayer bottle and give the grapes a couple of good sprays as you roll the grapes around. I only use the pouring bottle to refill my sprayer bottle since I learned this trick.  Now, whirl your fingers through the grapes until all the sides are coated and the dirt has had a chance to loosen, about 10 seconds.  Then with the FIT coated grapes still there, fill the colander with water as if you were going to wash them the recommended way except you will not use a cupful of FIT.<br /><br />Now you can really swish them around easily for about 45 seconds and you be be amazed at what you see in the water.  Pick the basket of grapes out of the colander and dump the yucky water.  Now rinse away the film on your grapes and you will be surprised by the color that appears.  The grapes will feel smooth, their natural powdery bloom is gone as well as the Pesticides, and the toxic anti-mold preservatives they are dusted with. They have a darker richer color not a coated look. Pop one in your mouth.  ALL YOU TASTE IS GRAPES - nothing else.  And it is amazing how good grapes can taste!!<br /><br />I use this same method with green beans and frozen blueberries which also have high levels of toxins on them.  For the green beans, I cut the ends and then cut them into 2" pieces.  That makes them swirl better in the bowl.  For Frozen blueberries, I am a little gentler so as to not damage them.  But DH eats them every morning - so the HAVE to be clean.<br /><br />We eat an apple a day in our family and I spray them and really massage them for a good 30 seconds.  Then rinse and wipe with a paper towel.  I tell you, I can NOT eat fruit and vegetables that have not been washed in FIT because their flavor is disgusting now that I know what clean produce tastes like.<br /><br />By using my spray and wash method, your FIT will last a good long time.  I use it at least 4-5 times a day and the 8 oz. spray bottle will go over 4 months before I need to refill it.<br /><br />BTW, you don't need to buy this kit.  You can buy just the sprayer and the larger refill bottle.  Any drainer which fits in a larger bowl will do just fine.<br /><br />I am sure this product will pay for itself health wise and in eating enjoyment.

review/summary: Save water and money
review/text: In your spray bottle, put equal volumes of Fit, a saturated water solution of sodium bicarbonate, water, and 70% isopropyl alcohol. The Fit and baking soda solution emulsify and lift the contaminates, the water helps keep the mixture from precipitating, and the alcohol keeps the mix fresh as well as cleans. Cost per volume is cut by half or more and a spritz or two is the same dose as using full strength Fit. I use it for hand wash and dish wash for all but the most severe food grease problems and in cold tap water. Cleans schmaltz, vege oils, and pork. Heavier grease such as tallow may require Ajax or warm water. I like this mixture because rinse off is not (in my opinion) nearly as critical as with the commercial chemical dishwash mixes and my hands don't end up smelling like a French funeral parlor.

review/summary: Fruit and Veggies safe to eat again
review/text: This product is simply amazing! I use it at least once a day and there is no after-taste from Fit like other washes I've tried. You can feel and see the difference in your produce as soon as you wash it with this product. Cucumbers, which usually feel waxy to the touch and have a chemically taste to them, taste and feel like normal cucumbers from the garden after washing them in this product. The picture of broccoli they show in the brochure is actually what happens when you wash it with Fit. Usually broccoli has a milky white film to it (even organic broccoli), but after washing it in Fit, it is bright green. Like other reviewers have said, the amount of dirt, wax, and build up this stuff removes makes you wonder what you've been eating all the years you didn't use this product. Bottom line...IT WORKS!<br /><br />This is also a really great price. At my grocery store they charge 12.99 for one bottle. So getting almost 3 times the amount and a strainer for only $20 is a great buy. The strainer is a little cheap, but it works as it should. Overall, this stuff works wonders and actually makes you feel like what you're eating is clean and safe, which in a day where most of our food is coated in dozens of pesticides and chemicals, usually from Mexico, and travels at least 1,300 miles to get to the store....is saying something.

review/text: I was sceptical about this product until I cleaned some broccoli crowns. I soaked them in the FIT for a couple of minutes in the provided bowl, sloshed them around and then rinsed them well in the provided collander. The comparison between what the broccoli looked like going into the bowl of FIT and how it emerged was mind boggling. The broccoli was so green and fresh looking after the wash and rinse that I was instantly 100% sold on this product. I have begun to eat better (alot more produce) and was concerned about pesticides and proper washing. I realized that just rinsing in water doesn't clean the produce as thoroughly as it should be. This product does that and has become a must have product in my cupboard.

I ended up eating more fresh fruit and vegetables.<br /><br />I've been using Fit for several years now.<br /><br />Sadly, I haven't been able to locate it in my local stores for some time now.  I've talked with my local stores and the company that makes it and told them how disappointed I was that Fit isn't in their stores and how much I loved this product.<br /><br />I was thrilled to find it for purchase here on Amazon (COOL).

review/summary: Fit fruit/vege cleaner
review/text: This is a great place to get this product in bulk. It is very expensive in the store. I eat a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables. This set lasts me about 6 weeks. The strainer is very nice and makes cleaning easier. I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: love this product, bowel/strainer has held up for over 5 years
review/text: I'm a vegan, the bowel and strainer sit right out on the counter as they are used several times a day. For those who have commented the strainer feels flimsy, it may, but mine has held up with no cracks or breakage for over 5 years with multiple daily use.<br />This is well worth the few dollars it cost for the length of time I have used it.<br />I don't eat any fruit or veggies without using this entire product!

review/text: This product is better that anything I have ever used, yet it is not advertised as much, it is a wonder in a bottle, my family is very happy I bought it. I can't seem to find it in my local supermarket.

review/summary: Works great!
review/text: I couldn't believe how much product you get-just as pictured! The strainer works very well for me, it's not too large so it's easy to fit under the cabinet. I was glad to find it on Amazon also since I could no longer find it in stores. It doesn't leave any aftertaste and really brings out the freshness in produce.
