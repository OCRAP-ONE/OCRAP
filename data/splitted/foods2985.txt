review/summary: 5 paws up! Expensive but worth every single penny
review/text: I lost 2 cats from kidney disease (most likely caused by melamine-tained cat food in 2007-8). When I got my new fur-baby, I swore it would never happen again.<br /><br />While there are several promising options that provide excellent feline nutrition AND meet mama's exacting standards, the part I hadn't factored in was having a picky cat. Most canned food has a pate-like texture... which she won't touch. There are a few sliced/chunks in gravy options... she licks up the gravy and leaves the rest.<br /><br />Weruva, however, she gobbles right up. Licks the plate clean - even the flavors with peas and other veggies.  I'm super impressed with this food - it meets my standards for food safety (grain free; human-grade; no yucky additives for color/odor/flavor; free range; hormone/antibiotic free, etc.) AND the darned cat will actually eat it.<br /><br />A few bonus features for this food:<br />- It's the only canned cat food I've found that doesn't make me gag when I open the can. Looks appetizing, like you've opened a can of progresso or something.<br />- Pleasant to non-existent odor when I open the can, spoon the food onto a plate, etc. My small apartment appreciates this!<br />- If any shreds remain on the plate, doesn't gross me out to wash with the same sponge I use on my own dishes.<br />- The... err.. end results in the litter box are also nearly non-existent as far as odor goes. My small apartment definitely appreciates this!<br /><br />I haven't tried her on any of the fish flavors (I can't stand the smell of fish at all and I'm not a fan of the Menadione that must be added to fish-based cat food), but here's my cat's expert opinion on the flavors she has tried:<br /><br />Paw Lickin' Chicken: Just plain and simple, shredded chicken breast in a light clear gravy.  I think this is the one she gets least excited about, so I don't feed it too often.<br /><br />Grandma's Chicken Soup: One of her favorites. This flavor tends to have much more liquid and less meat than the others so I wouldn't use it as a primary food. However, I like to rotate this one regularly and feed it more often in warmer weather to ensure she's getting enough moisture. Also contains peas, carrots, & pumpkin.<br /><br />Funky Chunky: Probably her 2nd favorite. Similar to Grandma's Chicken Soup, but much less broth/gravy and much more meat. This one also has peas, carrots, pumpkin, and the shreds of meat are larger.<br /><br />Nine Liver: Her 3rd favorite, which surprised me. Shredded chicken breast and chicken liver, no veggies. The liver pieces are actually fairly small tidbits, not huge chunks like they look to be in the photos.<br /><br />Green Eggs and Chicken: Shredded chicken breast, peas, spinach, and little bits of egg. She isn't as fond of this one, so I've stopped buying this flavor. Pretty sure it's the egg she doesn't like, as she does like another flavor that contains spinach.<br /><br />Peking Ducken: By far, her favorite. Shredded chicken breast, small tidbits of duck breast, pumpkin. I was quite surprised by how much she loved this flavor -especially since I only bought the first can of Peking Ducken on a  whim. (It would be one of the more expensive flavors!)<br /><br />On the Cat Wok: Another favorite. This one has shredded chicken breast and shredded beef, with pumpkin.<br /><br />Steak Frites: Shredded beef, sweet potato, & pumpkin. She prefers "On the Cat Wok" so I think she's not as fond of beef, but she's content to eat this flavor about once a week.<br /><br />I serve Grandma's Chicken Soup, Funky Chunk, 9 Liver, and Peking Ducken in heavy rotation, tossing in the occasional can of On the Cat Wok, Steak Frites, and Paw Lickin' Chicken.<br /><br />If your cat is extremely picky, I suggest trying Paw Lickin' Chicken.  If you feed fish, I've heard that Mack & Jack is the kind cats like the most.

review/summary: Chicken Soup for the Cat's Soul
review/text: Although my cat is not a finicky eater, he really loves Weruva's Grandma's Chicken Soup! Because I need to get more liquid into his diet (he has been diagnosed with struvite crystals and needs to ingest more liquid), this soupy food is the perfect way to do that. And finally, I like this cat food because it is "real" food, not chopped up by-products like many cat foods. As a result of feeding my best furry guy this food, he has had fewer digestive problems and no urinary issues.

review/summary: Particular Puss Loves this Food!
review/text: So, I have a HUGE cat (not fat, just laaarge) who has never had issues with being choosy about cat food until this past year. She'd kind of pick at a food for a week or so, then just completely stop. Getting her to eat consistantly has been a huge battle, and I've been worried because she's been losing weight which is not good on her gigantic Maine Coon self.<br /><br />I don't have much money, but finally did the math and figured out that buying cheaper food and then throwing half of it away wasn't saving me anything...invested in the Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken cat food. It came a few days ago, and I think the year of struggling to find something Beatrix will eat is finally over. She LOVES this food. She's taken to lounging by the bowl and casting pitiful looks of longing at me whenever its not on hand! lol She's happy, so I'm happy. And its no lie that this is human quality food. I haven't actually eaten any of it, cause...well...yuck, but it looks like better quality than the chicken you get at KFC! lol Plus, and this is big because I live in a small apartment...there is almost NO odor to it like most wet cat foods...just smells slightly chickeny.<br /><br />I've also noticed that her tummy seems to be bothering her less if the litter and furball issues are a good indicator. Good food = happy cat. Give it a whirl.

review/summary: The best cat food out there
review/text: I got my cats on this food after I found one of them urinating blood and refusing to use the litterbox.  The vet told me he didn't have crystals, and after two visits they still couldn't figure out what was wrong with him.  They wanted me to put him on the Hill's Science Diet for urinary health, but I read the ingredients, which include by-products and rice, and decided to do my own research to find a better quality cat food.  I can't sing the praises of this food loud enough.  My cat is no longer straining to urinate, or going outside the box.  I have yet to find a variety either of my kitties don't like.  Just be cautious, if you are looking for a grain free food (which all felines should eat), Weruva does have a couple varieties that contain rice.

review/summary: my cats LOVE this food
review/text: I switched to this food when my persian cat was diagnosed with Lower Urinary Tract disease.  The high moisture content of this food aided in curing my cat (with only nutritional changes!).  My cats love all of the flavors, but one of them is allergic to tuna, so now I only feed them the paw lickin' chicken.  They won't touch any other brand of canned food now! The food is also very high quality--it contains no grains (cats are obligate carnivores--feeding them grains is ridiculous), no by-products, free-range meat, nothing artificial, and the cans are BPA-free! I highly recommend this food.

review/summary: Getting away from Weruva may have saved my cat's life.
review/text: I started feeding my 17-year-old cat Weruva a little over a year ago when she got bored with her old food. She's a picky eater, so when I opened the first can and she started yowling "Give it to me NOW" like Veruca Salt, I figured I had a winner. The vet we had at the time - hereafter known as Old Vet - didn't see anything wrong with it, so Weruva became her diet.<br /><br />Kitty, who has always been a pudgy little picture of health, started losing weight last year. Old Vet was not concerned at first and certainly did not attribute her weight loss to her food. However, when it progressed from half a poiund, to one, to more than three, a battery of tests was clearly in order.  At that point (July) Kitty was diagnosed with a hyperthyroid and kidney disease. Frequent visits to Old Vet for diagnosis and treatment began... lots of fun, as you can imagine. Food was again not deemed to be a problem.<br /><br />A month ago Kitty started having continual problems with her bowels and developed a raging kidney infection. Old Vet put her on an antibiotic. Symptoms worsened. She appeared to be in rapid decline and was thoroughly miserable. The antibiotic only made a slight difference, and Old Vet wasn't giving us helpful answers, so we went to see New Vet. New Vet ordered more blood work (fourth draw of the year - oh boy).  When New Vet got the results, she immediately prescribed another course of antibiotics, and a new prescription diet.<br /><br />Whoda thunk? It's been one week, and hallelujah! Kitty's recovery has been drastic. I feel like we dodged a bullet... and now I have 40 cans of Weruva to get rid of. I can't prove that Weruva is the culprit for my cat's health problems, and I absolve neither Old Vet nor myself for missing the connection to baby's diet. But given the whole timeline, I simply cannot believe Weruva wasn't the biggest factor.<br /><br />Weruva because weluvya? Don't think so!

review/summary: Cats won't eat this flavor because they don't like picking out the bones
review/text: At first my cats enjoyed this flavor, but after a few cans they slowed down and started to eat less of it or reject it completely. The times they did nibble at the food, large fish bones and spinal columns were left at the bottom of their bowls. I think my cats simply don't like the flavor because they don't like having to pick all the bones out.

review/summary: No cat will go near it.
review/text: I purchased this food after reading the many positive revieves for  my 6 pound Exotic who loves to eat, especially chicken. On opening I was surprised  how much like human  food it looked and smelled and was sure she would love it. Well, one sniff and she looked at me as if I were  nuts. My other more finky cat likewise.  I tried  again a few weeks later with the same results.<br />I then decided to let a neighbor try it since I did not want it to go to waste.  His cat had the same results.  No deal.  He  then put some out for  four ferral cats  he was feeding . NO takers.  It is hard to believe that not one  of seven cats would refuse something hailed as so tempting unless the food was defective..<br />I would not try this food unless youi needed some cans to hold up a bookcase.<br />If looking for a premium chicken try Instinct. A bit pricy but my cats love it. I also learned not to fix a good thing.  Cats are not like  humans and don't seem to mind the same food everyday.

I spent tons of money on "samples" of canned foods for her and I ended up wasting so much money. She didn't like anything I put in front of her. I was online one night and happened to stumble upon Weruva. I did my research and not only was I blown away at how awesome the quality of the food is but also the story behind the company. All of the meats are cruelty free as well which is a big plus for myself and my husband! Amazon has the best price anywhere and I love the free shipping! :-) I have also been feeding her Orijen kibble. Considering the quality of both of these products, you can't beat the price!

review/summary: Healthy but extremely low calorie per can (be careful not to underfeed your cat)
review/text: When I opened the Weruva can (3oz, chicken), I immediately noticed that there is not enough solid food (chicken) in the can, and a large amount of the volume is filled up by potato starch and water (85% moisture).  I looked at the label - it says: "feed adult cats 1 oz for each pound of body weight".  So, it means that I need to give my 14 pounds cat 4 cans a day to maintain his present weight.  Usually when other pet food company says that, they are exaggerating and your pet can live on half the amount they recommended.  But it is not the case for Weruva, based on their website, the calorie content for the 5.5 ounce can is only 84 cal.  So, by doing a simple math, the calorie content for the 3oz can is only ~46 cal.  The ideal calorie intake for my 14 pounds cat is 195cal (formula: ideal weight (13 pounds) multiply by 15).  In other words, I need to feed my cat four 3oz can per day.  So, I need to spend $4 (3oz) per day on cat food (he lives on a non-kibble diet).  That is a lot of dough!!! And I can do better by making my own cat food or switch to another non-grain cat food brand.  I think this product is overpriced and cat owners need to be aware of the calorie content in Weruva's canned cat food, so that they won't underfeed their pets with insufficient amount of calorie.

review/summary: The BEST food my cat has ever eaten
review/text: I cannot stress enough what a picky eater my cat is. Just to get her to eat more than a quarter of a 5.5 oz can of food at a time is quite the ordeal. For some time, I had to mix Nutri-cal with her food, because she is tiny for her age and isn't gaining weight at the rate she should be (she is a kitten). I was just about to settle with Earthborn Holistic canned chicken, as she seemed to like it more than any other food I had tried feeding her. It also appeared and smelled far less disgusting to me than the mush that comes in most cans; the consistency of the Earthborn is chicken shreds in gravy, which my cat seems to prefer. But as I was browsing in the cat food section today, I noticed Weruva Paw-lickin Chicken and picked it up to try because according to the description, it seemed that it would have the same consistency as Earthborn. It's also Grain-free and has no veggies (only this flavor is veggie free though) like Earthborn. And it costs the same, so I figured it wouldn't be difficult financially to switch over to Weruva, if she happens to like it.<br /><br />When I opened the can of Weruva today, I immediately noticed that the quality of this food is even better than Earthborn. The formula is almost soupy, with thinner shreds, which are easier for my kitten to chew and swallow. The smell is VERY tolerable and it actually looks like food a human would eat. The BEST part however is that she ate almost ALL of the 3 oz can. I was so shocked to see that once she was done eating what I spooned into her bowl, she went over the open can and began eating.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned initially when I noticed that even though the food is not described as adult food, in the back in small print it says it is for adult nutrition. However, according to Weruva's website, it is fine to feed it to kittens. The only difference between adult food and kitten food apparently, is that kitten food is supposed to contain more protein, because they need more for their growing bodies. But if fed a sufficient amount, this food, especially because it is very protein rich to begin with, provides complete nutrition for kittens as well. Seeing how much she ate confirms that.<br /><br />My only concern with this food, which is any person's concern with any premium quality food is the price. These foods ARE pricey and it can be difficult to justify spending so much on cat food, but if you can afford it, the benefits of premium quality foods (those that are byproduct and grain free, and preferably veggie free) are:<br /><br />-Their poop becomes significantly less stinky. The difference is very noticeable.<br />-The food itself doesn't smell so bad. And this really depends on what type of meat and consistency you buy as well. If you buy a chicken or turkey flavor food, it will be less smelly than a fish food. I don't see the point in feeding your cat fish other than as an occassional treat if she likes it, because it contains some levels of mercury and is not as nutritious to begin with. I've noticed that the mushy formula food smells considerably worse than the gravy foods. Also, I understand that cat foods are smelly because cats will only eat food that has a very strong smell, but that being said, there's a difference between a stench that permeates your room and a smell that remains concentrated in the general area where the food itself is.<br />-You end up saving money on vet bills, because these foods provide superior nutrition and a healthy animal is less likely to be a sickly animal.

review/summary: Very high quality cat food
review/text: We have a cat that develops urinary stones easily, and must also be on a low purine diet.  The Science Diet food suggested by the vet resulted in dull, dry coats, vomiting, and lethargic behavior, even after a lenghty adjustment period.<br /><br />Weruva foods to the rescue!  Their Paw Lickin' Chicken, Grandma's Chicken Soup, and Peking Duck flavors meet our dietary needs perfectly, with much healthier, higher quality ingredients than the SD food.<br /><br />These are very "soupy" foods, with lots of liquid in the can, ideal for cats who may not stay well hydrated otherwise.  I was afraid that our cats would not eat the vegetable chunks, but they surprised me by not only eating them, but picking them out to eat first!<br /><br />The shredded chicken seems to be very high quality but the texture seems a little hard for them to manage sometimes.  At first, they sometimes left chicken on the plate.  Now, they seem more used to it and eat it more easily.<br /><br />After trying a number of different high end canned products, these are our cats' favorites, paws down! After several months on the food, they seem very healthy, with shiny coats, healthy-looking eyes, and lots of energy.

I am very happy that Mr Poof is finally eating everyday - he would go on hunger strikes when he became bored of his food.  Now, he is a little purr monster when the Weruva cans come out of the closet!!!!!!  I actually had a question for Weruva regarding BPA in their cans (there is none) and I got to speak to the owner - what a nice lady!

review/summary: It may be good food, but my cat won't eat it
review/text: I should have known better than to take a chance on a new cat food bought over the internet. Sophie (my cat)just gobbles up every bit of sauce and leaves all the chicken in the bowl. When I tried to cut up or mash the chicken I realized just how dry and tough it is and don't much blame her for not wanting to deal with it. You just never know if a cat is going to like something or not.

review/summary: Green Eggs & Chicken, 3 Paws Up (includes a 17 yo and 7 yo picky Debutantes). Great Human Grade Cat Food Experience
review/text: During the cat food recalls of 2007, I became aware that the dry food I always fed my cats was not a good diet. In fact - at the time - I prided myself on feeding cats @ $8.00 a month.  Luckily, this Generic was not using the Gluten that was the cause of the Recalls.  After trying various tastes, my budget and cats decided on Holistic (use to be Eagle Pack Holistic) Chicken dry and Wellness Chicken Grain Free.<br /><br />Then, we had a problem with the Wellness Canned Cat Food Recently (it was pulled from Amazon - and now my Canned Chicken food doesn't show up in a review).  I then went to the Wellpet site, and noticed mostly dry food was offered from many online retailers.  THIS told me something was afoot - and I went back to the forum which helped me with cat food research.  Unfortunately, many folks had gone back to fish as a main part of their cats food.  However, they did bring up the rotation aspect - this means never feeding the same type of cat food concurrently, and also picking up some locally first, to make sure your cats will eat the darn thing.<br /><br />Locally, Chicken was the least affected of the Wellness foods, and the store I get it from, Wellness is manufactured at ANI (code begins MW).  This means I could also get a food that was produced at Menu/Simmons.  However, Weruva was raved about in the forums, so without knowing where it was manufactured - I gave a few cans a shot (Green Eggs & Chicken was the first flavor I read - so that is what I tried).  All cats slopped that food right up with no ill effects (Siberia is a 13 yo with sensi tummy issues, and there were none with this food - even after he gulped it up).<br /><br />I then looked up Weruva on the Internet, and found out it was manufactured in Thailand.  This first gave me pause, but they do guarantee Human Grade Food, and the food in the cans look quite edible (and no, I'm not eating it - but in an emergency ;-).<br /><br />Amazon has a better deal on this food than my local retailer. So my order for the cans went in (I had read some negative reviews here about the quality of the food, but with the Amazon Guarantee - how can you go wrong?)  I am pleased to announce that the food received from Amazon looked and tasted (according to the cats), as good as that purchased locally.  So for Weruva, Amazon has my business.<br /><br />With rotation, you can circumvent the cost of Weruva in a multi-cat household, AND being on a fixed income, through rotating.  I've settled on four canned food varieties, and one dry food (I may also be inclined to try some Weruva Paw Licken' Chicken, but for now - I have plenty of food).  The cost for multi-cat households is also offset by buying the larger canned varieties - 12.5oz to 13oz, and learning how to store them in the Refrigerator.<br /><br />On Amazon, I recommend the following:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a> (Its not grain free, but I personally don't like the mix for the regular, and neither do my cats).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a> (I had used it in 2007, and decided it wouldn't hurt them in a rotation.  Its the only wet food that contains some fish).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a> (I have tried to go all wet, but Baby Girl - 17, has had problems with all Grain Free, so a little dry didn't hurt her).<br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />A side note, many supplement with Friskies canned in order to cut costs.  I personally have yet to get over the meat by-product thing.  However, if it would help your budget - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOR6">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Turkey & Giblets Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> is THE best one to use for this purpose (no glutens).<br /><br />3 paws up for Weruva.

review/text: There's a lot to say about this cat food but I will just mention one thing: This evening I brought home some grilled chicken and offered the leftovers to my male cat, he tried some but would not eat anymore and continued to meow at me. I then took away the "people" chicken and gave him the Weruva paw licken' chicken and he gobbled it up as if he had not eaten in days.

review/summary: Best Kitty Food Money Can Buy!
review/text: Layla is extremely picky and has left certain luxury brand wet foods out to waste simply because they were unappetizing to her (How? I don't know!). And yes, she is probably too spoiled =), but I recently adopted her malnourished and hyperthyroid and I have been trying my best to get her on a healthy eating schedule. Anyway, the only flavor she goes absolutely nuts over is the Polynesian BBQ! She will go on hunger strikes if I don't have that flavor around. I don't know what they put in this flavor (crack? =)) to make Layla go nuts, but it's all she wants and now I'm forced to keep buying it.<br /><br />If you have a cat that has problems eating or is malnourished/anorexic (like Layla was), you would be hard-pressed to find food as high quality and apparently tasty as Weruva. My body-builder boyfriend remarked that perhaps if he gets hungry late one night he might pop open a can! It is made from free-range animals, and is processed in a human-grade facility. My only gripe, and it is VERY small, is that most of the food looks the same in the can (particularly the chicken flavors), so it feels like I'm not feeding Layla a variety or something special sometimes. And maybe cats prefer it like that--I do know they can be creatures of habit, so who knows?<br /><br />Again, if you have a picky or skinny cat, I would not hesitate to pick up a few cans of either polynesian bbq, steak frites, or grandmother's chicken soup. They are similar in price to other "luxury" brands, but the quality of Weruva is far superior. You aren't losing anything, and you may end up with a very happy cat =).<br /><br />EDIT: Layla had to stop taking her methimazole due to side effects, and while we were working with her vet for other options, her stooling and over-urination (polyuria) have normalized. ! I am certainly not attributing this solely to the food, but I think the high quality nutrition and supplements she has been receiving have helped Layla heal and perhaps  helped to correct some of her metabolic abnormalities. AND on a side note,  when I received Layla, her hair was like matted wire that fell out with just petting; now it is getting silky, and without those pesky oily parts (you know, behind the front legs?). She is really becoming quite beautiful.

review/summary: My cats love this food!
review/text: I've tried various premium wet cat foods, including wellness (old formula and new core) and my cats just seemed to tolerate it. My female cat wouldn't even eat wellness, so I thought this might be right up their alley. The second I opened the can they were intrigued. I've never seen them eat their food so fast! Even my female (who I usually have to go get and put in front of her food) was sitting there crying for her dinner that day. I've never seen her eat so fast and be so happy about it. This is also considerably cheaper than wellness (about ten dollars less) which is awesome.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cat food!<br />I was especially impressed by the fact that the cans are BPA free and contain no chemicals. That isn't even the case for many organic human food brands, so I'm impressed.

review/summary: Less is not More
review/text: I recently changed over from dry to wet food for my cats.  Trying to find a grain, veggie and fruit free food is not easy, cats are obligate carnivores remember and don't need that stuff (do the research).  I thought I found it in this chicken product.  However, when I opened the can I noticed lots of fluid and potato starch. After spilling out the liquid and rinsing off the potato starch (why is that there anyway? A filler?) The can lost 2 oz. of weight.  With the prices of cat food going up and up, I want more not less.  Don't misunderstand me, this is a fairly good product, a little low in fat, but the cats love it just the same. I just want the company to know if they say its 5.5 oz. then don't pump it up with junk to save a few pennies.  Consumers are not stupid.

review/summary: Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K)
review/text: I have been giving my cat Weruva for about a week after I received a free can from my local pet store. My cat absolutely loved it and ate it right up! So, I was pleased and decided to order more... without doing my research. I was very saddened when I learned that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K)is used in their FISH (please note this ingredient is used only in fish) I do not understand why they are using this synthetic form of Vitamin K when they could easily substitute something real like KELP. Do your own research, especially on Menadione. I would also like to greatly note that a small "made in Thailand" is on the can and that also freaked me out. The product looks amazing, my cat loves it and I will finish off the cans I bought locally but will be returning this to Amazon. Come on, Weruva, I think you could do better than this. (By the way, Vitamin K is NEEDED for Fish diets in cats, but there are other ways to provide it in the canned foods.)

I have been through many cat foods trying to find a non grain/glutton/corn based food that all three of my cats like that isn't extremely expensive.  I finally found it in this cat food.  I cannot stress enough how good of quality it is.  It actually smells like chicken a human would eat fresh out of the can.  All three of my cats LOVE it and it is very good for those of you that may have cats with UTI issues.  It is also very reasonably priced and Prime eligible.  I also like that fact that it is available in 5.5 ounce cans as many non-grain foods come in smaller cans.  This is a winner all around and will be the only canned cat food I will be buying in the future.

review/text: My cat LOVES this food and immediately begins eating as soon as I put it down.  The Nine Liver is her favorite flavor.  The liver chunks are not as large as pictured, and they seem to sink to the bottom of the can - just make sure to stir.  She likes many of the other Weruva flavors, including Green Eggs & Chicken, Paw Lickin Chicken, Funky Chunky, and Mediterranean Harvest.  These varieties have lots of gravy, while most of the other flavors are a bit less juicy.<br /><br />The order from Amazon arrived on time and there were no problems with the packaging.  The exterior Amazon box held another sealed box containing the case of food.  All the cans were in perfect condition.<br /><br />My cat only eats grain-free, wet food, and I'm glad I found Weruva to add to her rotation. Great food, highly recommended.  I'll be buying more!

review/summary: Weruva Paw-Lickin' Chicken
review/text: A 5 star must have canned act food for the discerning cat lover!! A proper feline diet should be void of dry cat food and most important is a quality ingredient wet cat food(if you cannot feed a raw diet) and I believe there is no better product than this!! Cats seem to absolutely love it, and it smells and looks just like freshly cooked chicken - which it is!! It is great for their urinary tract, and there are many interesting choices of Weruva to satisfy your cat's culinary diversity.  I cannot say enough about this product. My 3 month old kitten was not gaining weight, and  my veterinarian and I were very concerned. He had simply lost his appetite and was not gaining an ounce over 3lbs although I purchased so many different premium foods to entice him! When I was told about Weruva and first gave it a try, my kitten regained his zest for eating and immediately gained weight and is the most beautiful cat you would ever see!! He is 6 months old now and close to ten pounds!! He comes running the minute I open the Weruva stocked cabinet. It was a godsend & you can see the quality in every single can that you open!!

review/summary: Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken 5.5 Oz. Can (24 Pack)
review/text: We purchased the Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken after adding a new kitten to our family. After shelter and vet food recommendations, we had upgraded to the shelter's all-natural healthy brand but the cats much preferred the junk from the grocery store and the senior cat rejected the natural food. After reading many reviews, We tried this brand and flavor. My partner was concerned our picky senior cat would not eat it either, but all three love it. We have also tried the Weruva Middle East Feast, which all will eat, but Paw Lickin' Chicken is the favorite so far.<br /><br />We will be trying other flavors and are also trying some Best Feline Friend varieties. BFF is a bit cheaper than these Weruva standard brand foos, and while they seem to like the one we tried so far (Tuna and Bonito Be Mine), the chicken is still tops. All of these look and smell so good, I could certainly see eating this in an emergency - it is certainly as good or better than the canned chicken at the grocer. My partner no longer turns up his nose when feeding the cats wet food.<br /><br />The 5.5 ounce can size is great for us, with two cats sharing a can twice a day on top of two small dry food feedings per day.

review/summary: Finally might wean my cat off Fancy Feast
review/text: The first morning I set this down for my cat she gobbled up nearly two of the three ounce cans.  With subsequent feedings  her zeal has waned but she does manage to eat one can every morning, in do-able doses.  Then she gets her beloved Fancy Feast in the evening.  I want very much to get Fancy Feast out of the cycle because even though the classic recipes contain no grains, it does contain by-products and also fish and my cat has a fish allergy.  This Weruva chicken is wonderful stuff.  All white meat with vitamins and minerals in a bit of sauce.  Even comes in a BPA-free can.  There is zero stench, something I certainly can not say about Fancy Feast.  I am hoping she will continue to eat this product each morning for now because at least I'm cutting the amount of Fancy Feast down by half.  I plan to use up the Fancy Feast on hand in this way and ease her over to all Weruva.  Now an update - several weeks into the new feeding regime and my cat is happily eating up a three ounce can of this food every morning.  Without hesitation too!  I am so happy to have found a quality canned cat food that my sweetie loves.  Something I am enjoying is not having to break apart and chop up a semi-solid mass of pate style cat food.  This Weruva recipe comes out of the can ready to eat, I just remove the lid and pour the contents into a bowl.  I hope Amazon will add this product to their Subscribe and Save program.

It appears that they put a little bit of the outside of the fish in each can as a treat.

I'm so glad I found this food, very healthy and not made in China by the slave labor in the Laogai or chemicalsantifreeze, etc. that finds its way into the food.<br /><br />I knocked it down 1 star due to the amount of liquid, which is actually good since Cats get their water from food in the wild.  I just think it's a bit too much, but I'm sticking with it because it's real meat, very healthy and the Monster just loves it.

review/summary: not the best for my cat
review/text: I got this for my cat, thinking it was 'human grade', grain free, hence good for my cat. I realized the marketing is aimed at human sensibilities because it certainly looks and smells good enough for 'people' food.<br />It may be great for some cats, but mine gained 2 lb since she's been eating this and I was feeding her much less than suggested. She also developed urinary problems. My vet who is one of the few vets who have studied nutrition, tried calling Weruva to find out more specifics about their food including calories, because many of her feline patients were eating Weruva and gaining considerable weight. The staff at Weruva would not talk to her or answer her questions and I couldn't guess why that would be unless their research has no real scientific backing to indicate this is a nutritious food. I tried calling them about week after that to see if they would tell me anything -- I got the same dismissive response. Pet food is not regulated and these smaller manufacturers can get one vet to review their ingredients and pay them off to say - 'hey this is a great, human-grade, grain free food'. While I've read the positive reviews about this food and some obviously find their cats love it, if your cat is gaining weight or developing urinary problems while on Weruva, think twice about buying it.

There is VERY LITTLE chicken. I would say there is half a teaspoon of chicken in the whole can. What happened??? I want my money back. I didn't spend good money on gravy.

review/summary: The cats like it :)
review/text: I don't really know how to review cat food, but my two Bengals seem to love this stuff. One of them eats every flavor Weruva, but the other will only eat the Mack and Jack. I like that I can see the pieces of fish in the food, it's not some mystery ground product like some brands I've seen.<br />Shipping is always super-fast.

review/summary: So disappointed.. where is the meat?
review/text: I got this product about a month ago to try it for the first time.  My cat and I were pleased so I got 24 more... what a mistake.. where is the meat???  There is more liquid than meat.  At least 2/3 liquid and a few slivers of chicken.  My cat is seriously crying right now and tapping me on the leg begging for food which usually she just curls up and goes to sleep for awhile after eating. I had to get another brand that I have for emergencies in case food does not arrive on time. I need to have a serious talk with Amazon over this.

review/summary: Mideast Feast is a life saver for my siamese with kidney trouble
review/text: Recently switched from feeding friskies for the past 15 years because one of my siamese was having kidney problems. Tried a lot of different higher end brand cat foods, Wellness, Evo, Nutro. He was picky about almost all of them except for the Weruva Mideast feast. He loves human tuna out of a can and comes running for it so I thought he might like it. Turns out even my other finicky siamese who has refused to eat anything but dry food his entire life will eat this! All four of my cats eat this like it's the best food ever. The only problem with that is I go through it so fast! The best thing though is that it has greatly improved my cat's kidney function and because of that is worth every penny to me. I will never go back to friskies and their corn and grain again. It was killing my cat.<br /><br />I'd also like to add that amazon has the best price on this food from everywhere else I've searched which is wonderful! Everywhere else charges 5 or 6 dollars more plus 10 dollars shipping. With amazon I get free 2 day shipping and a much better price. Thank you amazon.

review/summary: My Cats say, "We-Ruv-Ya!"
review/text: We have older cats with one having hyperthyroidism. Even on meds, cats with this condition tend to throw up more than normal so they need more protein and liquid. I didn't feel like she was retaining the nutrients she needed as she kept throwing up much of her food.<br /><br />I did alot of research before trying this food. The Vet recommended some type of prescription diet for her to help her put some pounds on, but it's got grain and fillers in it (yuk). Plus we tried it once and she hates it so there ya go.<br /><br />So, I cut down on the dry food and have been giving them the Weruva pouches w/Chicken & Pumpkin and the Paw Lickin' Chicken. It's been 2 1/2 weeks and our hyperthyroid cat has only had one incident which was an extremely small hairball so no biggie. Now, I'm not saying that this food is a miracle cure or anything like that. But our cats are getting more real food, gravy, and no by-products, and the hyperthyroid cat's fur looks TONS better and she's even filled out a little. I've even stopped giving her the Fortiflora this past week...no throw up so just haven't needed it. All of us couldn't be happier!<br /><br />The chicken is both of our babies favorites, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that I could just wipe off their empty bowls with a paper towel. There's just nothing there when they walk away!<br /><br />Yes, it's more expensive. But I can't wait until we go to the Vet in 6 months and he asks me what we've been giving her to help her gain a little weight and keep her looking so good.<br /><br />Oh you know I'll be shouting it out, "We-ROOO-VAH!"

review/summary: cat goes crazy for this
review/text: my cat is almost 10 years old now and I started thinking more about what I feed her.  Admittedly I should have paid more attention to this years ago but believe it or not, until recently, I just thought pet food was pet food.  Gizmo had a bladder infection a year or so ago and after learning that kidney disease is a common and deadly disease for cats, I wanted to see if switching foods would help her ward that off so she can live another happy 10 years or more.  I did research and read all about how dry food and grains is unhealthy for cats and mainly filled with undigestible ingredients.  Grains in the food cause crystals to form in the urine as the cats body tries to process them.  Higher protein foods, grain free and with a higher moisture content are what is best.  I read all the reviews here and decided to try this paw licking chicken flavor.  For starters it doesn't have that gross smell most canned cat foods do.  It seems close to human grade to me.  From the first try of this Gizmo was hooked.  Now she cries for it, rubs around me, sometimes even gets wild if I am ignoring her and jumps up onto the counter to get my attention that she wants to be fed.  After buying 2 cases on here, I decided to try some regular store bought canned food.  I just thought this may be a bit pricey to maintain and she was going through it like crazy.  I tried several different brands from Petco and several from the supermarket.  I tried to get as close to this flavor as possible with shredded chicken flavors and none of that pate stuff.  Nothing!  She will not eat a single other brand now.  She cries and cries and if I set down something different she will sniff it and walk away.  I tried being stubborn and said, well if you are hungry enough you will eat eventually.  Well she won because she actually started to lose weight.  It was incredible.  This 6lb cat won by starving herself.  So I ordered more and she is eating and happy again.  If it makes her happy and it's healthier than all the dried grain filled junk I fed her for years then I will continue to buy it

review/text: My 2 cats love this food, and it is very good for them as there is all meat and vegetables without filler.  It is also quite pricey and difficult to find in the regular pet store.  I was so happy to find that I could order an entire case through amazon!  It is a great deal, arrives at my door so I don't have to drive to the specialty pet store and lug the cans around after paying too much.  This order arrived quickly, packed nicely so that none of the cans were dented or damaged.  This has been such a time saver.

review/summary: This food turns my cat into a wet vac
review/text: My cat inhales this food, he absolutely loves it.  In addition, because he licks the bowl clean there is never any bits of food left that has to be scraped off the plate.  Also, since it smells like canned chicken it does not give him funky cat food breath and mi gato is a face licker so this is a plus.  Only downfall is cost, at his weight he would need four cans a day which is quite expensive so I feed him a mix of no grain dried food and the Weruva canned.

review/text: My cats love this cat food and it's loaded with juicy gravy, which my male cat needs to keep from getting urinary tract infection.  Before using canned cat food with soupy gravy, I had to put water in their food.  Now I just give the cats their food out of the can with a few drops of high quality olive oil on top.  My male cat even goes into the trash bag to lick the can and lid.  I don't provide any dry food now because of my male cat's tendency to UTI.

review/summary: My Cat, Puppy, is a very happy customer!
review/text: I decided to re-write my review in order to let you guys in on how my cat's been doing on the Waruva cat food.<br /><br />We decided to try pretty much every flavor on here because I couldn't find any really good specific reviews for anything other than one or two flavors, here's how my cats liked the following:<br /><br />Paw Lickin Chicken- This is one of the favorites with both cats, although my male cat, Puppy, has a harder time eating it unless I put it on a flat plate, he can't seem to get it all while in the bowl. However, my female cat, Akira, has NO issues with it at all.<br /><br />Grandma's Chicken Soup- An epic fail for Puppy. He hates it, and refuses to eat it. I don't know if it's because of how liquidy it is, or if there's a smell he isn't so into... but he hates it.  Akira loves it and can't get enough... not sure how helpful this is, but I can say that if your cat prefers to lick their food instead of biting at it, you probably won't have a lot of success with this one, because Puppy licks his food and Akira bites hers.<br /><br />Polynesian BBQ - my least favorite of all the waruva products. It smells really strongly of fish (yuck) and is congealed... it's like jello. I have to fork it out of the can and mash it up in order to get Puppy to eat this.<br /><br />Peking Duckin was an overall success with both cats<br /><br />The Eggs and Chicken - Puppy would not eat the peas but Akira would (although she had some diarrhea after this.. but I think the eggs may be the culprit).<br /><br />Steak Frites- was hands down the favorite for both cats. It also contains pumpkin so I prefer to give it to Akira since she seems to have more issues with getting the runs.<br /><br />Those were the notable of the flavors our cats have tried. I hope this is somewhat helpful to you. Overall I recommend going with paw lickin chicken and steak frites.

review/text: I simply cannot recommend this food highly enough.  My formerly picky eater is ecstatic every time she hears the can open, and I feel confident that the food I'm giving her is not full of unnecessary carbs and additives.  Since switching to Weruva, she's lost the 2 pounds our vet suggested she lose, and her fur is incredibly soft and shiny.  At her annual exam, the vet actually asked, "What on earth are you feeding this cat to make her look so good?!"

review/summary: High quality, and the picky kitty eats it
review/text: Mideast Feast has been a boon to my elderly cat with chronic kidney failure.  He is not on a special kidney diet, and your vet's recommendations may vary, but our goal is to keep him from getting any skinnier.  He's sampled all the special kidney foods and won't eat them, so he gets any regular food he will eat.<br /><br />There are some days when he gets cranky and picky and won't eat much... this is our go-to food for those days as we can almost always count on him to eat this.  The other non-ill cats like it too.  The first ingredient is tuna with tilapia close behind so these must have compelling flavors.<br /><br />All the cats initially liked it, but over time slowed down.  It seems like it's about the chunky texture.  If I whirr this thru my little handy chopper for a few seconds, they finish it off pronto.<br /><br />The only negative is one in my own head... I get irritated with cat foods trumpeting "grain free" and then tossing in tapioca starch or potato starch... yeah, those aren't grains, but if a cat owner is looking to limit carbs to some extent, the "grain free" tag can be a little misinterpreted as "low starch".  Beyond that though, the skinny old cat is eating it gladly, so I won't complain further.  This flavor appeals to all my cats (it's a rarity to reach a group agreement) so odds are decent your cat will enjoy it too!

review/summary: Good for cats with bowel/stomach issues
review/text: My 9 year old cat has had chronic colitis and now inflammatory bowel disease. He has been on steroids, Rx diets, anti-nausea, antacids, etc, etc, etc.  After much research I decided to put him on a wet diet - dry kibble no matter how high quality just doesn't seem to cut it for IBD kitties.  In fact, it just aggrevates the situation. After much trial and error of different higher quality cat foods, Weruva seems to be the answer.  His formerly slushy *nasty* poo is now normal looking cat poop!  Who knew I could think his poo is now just so beautiful... I digress.  He is OFF all meds.  He was picky about what he would eat but we've found that he loves the Weruva brands - He gets Paw Lickin Chicken every night.  The only thing I add to his food is a good probiotic.  I am so pleased with this product.  Not only does he love it but it by far looks the best - you can see the quality of this food, it is not unidentifiable mush.  As a side note to this review, he loves the Steak Frites as well made by Weruva.

I don't like that there are so many ingredients (and some are questionable to me, as I don't know what they are without a bit of research - ex. dicalcium phosphate) but I think it's far superior to most cat food on the market. The ideal diet would be a cat's natural food or the raw food cat diet, but if you don't feed your cat that, this is a good cat food to choose. I think it's healthier than other brands and there are no grains!

review/text: We were looking for wholesome healthy canned cat food and went to our local natural pet food store and they recommended Weruva (that and Tiki Cat are their most popular, they said).  My two picky cats plus the stray cat outside LOVE it!

review/summary: Cats thought it was okay
review/text: I'm a big fan of Weruva cat food, but my cats weren't thrilled with this particular flavor. They ate most of it, but didn't "dig in" like they usually do - just kind of picked at it. The dog, on the other hand, was more than happy to finish it off for them. I must admit that I was kind of glad when they didn't wolf it down, because it definitely smells very fishy and I was happy that I wouldn't have to buy it again! :)

review/summary: made in the USA and made in Thailand, do they hold the same quality?
review/text: I have two cats that are very picky eaters, sometime ago I found out about weruvia and they seemed to really enjoy it. So, in order to keep my furry friends happy and save some money I purchased weruvia online, and to my my surprise one of them would not eat it at all. I discovered that the food I purchased online unlike the one I was buying at the pet store was made in Thailand. I found a can from a previous purchase which had been made in the USA and the cat ate it without a problem. So, I wondering if anyone has had the same problems???

review/summary: Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken wet cat food
review/text: I have two diabetic senior cats in my brood and I try to make sure I feel them all the best quality food I can fit into my budget.  The cats do love this food and I feel good feeding it to them because it is high quality.  The ingredients read like human-food, there are virtually no preservatives and it doesn't have that "cat food" smell.  The cats always lick off all of the "broth" it's packed in before moving on to the shreds of chicken breast itself.<br /><br />My only caveat is the cost.  Yes, I know you pay more for good quality cat food but I have read that even a lower quality wet food is better for your cats than a diet consisting of only dry food, even if it's the best dry food.  I feed my cats wet food once daily and they have "grazing priviledges" with a bowl of high quality dry food (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1WE5O">Solid Gold Indigo Moon Holistic Cat Food</a>) that I typically have to fill once a day.  I may buy this once in a while as a treat but they seem to enjoy the less expensive leading brand just as much.

review/text: My cats LOVE this food! It actually smells good for pet food, and it has a lot of gravy, which I read is a good thing for felines who don't drink much.<br />One of my cats had crystals in his bladder, but I didn't want to use the urinary diet food recommended by my vet so I tried this and it seems a great compromise.<br />Also, compared to other higher end cat food (wellness, newman, organix...) it's not more expensive and my cats seem to enjoy it much more.

review/text: This mix produced a good cake, but it wasn't really what I would consider a coffee cake.<br /><br />The cake had the consistency of an angel food cake, though it was a bit more dense than a true angel food cake.<br /><br />The taste was more like a lighter version of a pound cake. This is rather interesting since the cake contained no dairy.

review/summary: High Mountain Gourmet Magic.  Food of the Gods.
review/text: Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa), on a Super Saver Shipping.<br /><br />The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.<br /><br />In that maiden purchase I also added lavender and clove essential oils to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, and lavender tea.  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here offering Now Foods, including All Star Health, Vitamin Life, and Nutricity.<br /><br />I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment.<br /><br />If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, "nutrition" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of "yummy.").<br /><br />Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.<br /><br />The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to "gourmet it" accordingly.<br /><br />-- As "rice" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with "noodle heaven"; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).<br /><br />-- As "oatmeal" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, creme, that type of thing.<br /><br />As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:<br /><br />- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid ( water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa.<br /><br />-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12-15 minutes.<br /><br />-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Normally, a microwave cooks 4 times faster than "outside-the-waves" cooking, but, of course that time varies with larger amounts of food.  For example, 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8 -16 minutes.<br /><br />-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (�) cup liquid.<br /><br />I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate "lid"; zap it for another minute or half, then let it "steep" in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)<br /><br />In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.<br /><br />But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate "lid" I can just place it on the table for family style "digging in."<br /><br />I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!<br /><br />In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with both those sellers, when/if the products are available on Amazon).  Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm very confident in ordering any item from them.<br /><br />Quinoa has an iteresting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain:<br /><br />--  The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment's, like worms or parasites.<br /><br />-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.<br /><br />-- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the "naked" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions.  Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise-old-grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eons-younger food offerings.  I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre-washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available.<br /><br />Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).<br /><br />Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.<br /><br />I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of "health"?<br /><br />Here's an interesting question to ponder:<br /><br />Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had "lived" long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?<br /><br />For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024CW1O">Virgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.oz</a><br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books, including:<br />Molasses Moon

This grain is a great cereal (add a sweetner or fruit (fresh or dried), add some nuts (chopped almonds, pecans, brazil, filberts or sunflower seeds)add juice or milk and you have a filling breakfast.  My favorite is grated apples, dates and chopped pecans, I add some cinnamon, nutmeg and milk.<br /><br />For Lunch I add any chopped veggies (tomatoes, cucumber, green onions, bell peppers, avocado, olives, raw peas, corn - you get the idea) I have on hand (raw & chopped), with some basil, oregano, parsley (any combination of herbs you enjoy) with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar  on a bed of lettuce and you have a great and filling lunch.  You may add cooked or leftover chicken.

review/text: I've been reading and hearing about quinoa for some time now but was unable to find it in my small community.  After purchasing via Amazon, I'm pleased that I did.  This small grain makes a great substitute for rice, pasta or other starches in your diet. It has a wonderful nutty taste alone or many different seasonings can be added.  It can be used in various salad, vegetable combinations or even dressed up for a dessert or breakfast food.  I'm certainly pleased that I've found a new staple for my pantry.

review/summary: Excellent Quinoa!
review/text: I've only eaten quinoa about twice in my whole life.  Now that I have decided to convert my diet to a more whole plant food based program (after watching the documentary Forks Over Knives), I decided to try the Now Foods brand of this whole grain.  I mixed it with some organic amaranth grain that I recently purchased.  It was delicious!<br /><br />I combined the two grains (the amaranth and the quinoa) together (1/2 cup of each) and rinsed them first (which can be a chore with the amaranth since the grains are soooo tiny -- you really need cheesecloth to strain the amaranth grains when rinsing).<br /><br />Then I soaked the combined rinsed grains (in 1 and 3/4 cup of warm water with 1 tablespoon + 2 1/4 teaspoons of raw apple cider vinegar - I use Bragg's) for 7 hours.<br /><br />NOTE:  I did the soaking in my rice maker on the WARM setting (when soaking grains you want to keep the mixture warm) so at the end of the 7 hours soak I just flipped on the rice maker from WARM to COOK and let it cook (my rice maker shuts off automatically when the grains are done).  (Yes, you can just cook it in the water that it's been soaking in!)  I added a little sea salt to the mixture and gave it a good stir.<br /><br />Made 2 very delicious servings.

review/summary: Healthy "fast food" for kids and adults
review/text: We LOVE couscous but I have a hard time finding the whole wheat version in our local stores, so I thought I would try this brand.  I'm thrilled that this is organic and that the only ingredient on the label is certified organic unenriched whole durum semolina (wheat).<br /><br />I made the first round of this couscous tonight for my kids' dinner (a 3 year old and a 1.5 year old).  I love that I can make them something healthy in the time it takes to boil a cup of water and wait 5 minutes.  It's that simple.  To make it a meal, I simply added some herbs and a little bit of precooked meat to the water prior to adding in the couscous, and "voila!" in less than 10 minutes I was sprinkling parmesan cheese on their healthy, easy, quick dinner which they gobbled up and asked for seconds.  My husband and I both tried it as well and it was delicious.  The couscous cooked up very light and fluffy.  I love how couscous can pair with so many different ingredients to create various types of meals/tastes, how fast it is to cook, and how much my entire family loves it!  Great product!

review/summary: Whole wheat couscous is hard to find
review/text: When my local store stopped carrying any whole wheat couscous, I was sorely disappointed. I was glad to find it available on Amazon.<br /><br />This fine-grained couscous is good quality and tasty. I like it as a quick-cooking alternative to rice or noodles. It's great for camping since all you do is pour boiling water over it and wait three minutes. We often have it under stir-frys, dahls, or with a gravy-rich chicken dish. It holds sauce very well.<br /><br />Four jars is a lot - it's about 4 cups per jar, with our family of four needing about a cup or a cup and a half per meal - but we'll get through it all eventually.

review/summary: Ditch the white rice, eat this
review/text: This is a very fine grained couscous, which allows it to be ready to eat in not more than 5 minutes.  If your carbohydrate staple is white rice, give this one a try.  It cooks faster, is more nutritious and tastes better too.  Mind that this doesn't come with it's own "spice" or "flavor" pack, and it may taste bland on when cooked just plain.  However it serves as a very good base.  You can add almost any ingredient to your taste to make a great couscous dish.

review/summary: FANTASTIC product
review/text: We've tried alot of the Josef products... they're all absolutely delicious.  Glad to see Amazon is offering them as they can be hard to find.  Their cookies fit the bill for those with allergies to multiple ingredients -- but you'd never know they were allergy friendly from the taste.  They're worth the price.  (I can serve them to guests -- kids and adults alike -- and they never know the difference!)
