review/summary: Loosen up and Enjoy Life!
review/text: I wonder if the average person knows how difficult it is for someone with severe food allergies to find packaged preprepared foods they can safely eat?  Let alone something that actually resembles the real thing in taste and texture (without tasting like flavored cardboard).<br /><br />I'm allergic to soy, gluten, wheat and various other foods.  Ingesting even tiny amounts cause life threatening reactions.  As a result I cook most of my own meals from scratch, don't often risk eating out and take "safe" food with me when I travel.<br /><br />Unfortunately soy and gluten seem to be the foundation of most western foods.  So it's really REALLY hard to find foods that don't contain at least one of these ingredients.  So having an option like "Enjoy Life" foods is wonderful.<br /><br />Yes they're small and yes they're rich and calorie laden ... but they taste good and ARE SAFE for ANYONE to eat.  Believe me that's an incredibly bold statement.  So who cares how big they are?!  Besides, at Amazon's prices you can eat more if you want to ...

review/summary: Soft Baked, Snickerdoodle cookies by Enjoy life
review/text: Scrumptious! Especially knowing that these cookies have no saturated fat, no cholesterol, and a good amount of "untastable" fiber and flaxseed.<br />Soft, granular, cookie dough like texture with a subtle brown sugar flavor. Almost like eating a fluffy sugar cookie without all the "bad" indgredients.

review/text: I am not intolerant to anything except lactose, but my baby that I'm nursing is really sensitive to dairy and eggs! I've been on a really strict diet for her but have been DYING for something sweet and decided to try out a few items from the health food store. I can't believe how tasty these are! I am VERY picky and I think considering the fact that they have no dairy, eggs, gluten etc. these are FANTASTIC! Perfect little sweet treat to satisfy my craving!

review/summary: Gluten free happiness
review/text: My 2 year old son is autistic and has been on a gluten and casein free diet for about 3 months now, he has a lot of sensory issues, especially with textures so he is very picky about foods and the snicker-doodles from Enjoylifefoods are now a regular part of his diet. He will not eat any other gluten free cookie even others made by this company.I also find it much cheaper to buy them from amazon since they are about $3.50 a box at the cheapest in our local grocery store. Hope this review is helpful to you.

review/summary: Great flavor with overly sticky texture
review/text: I'll be the first to admit that I'm very forgiving of allergy friendly foods - being allergic to gluten, dairy, eggs & legumes - but these cookies would not make my desert island list. The flavor was close to what I remember of my last 'real' gingerbread cookie (of almost a year ago), the texture however, was not even close. The cookie disintegrated in my mouth and turned into a gummy mess that stuck to the roof of my mouth - not pleasant... A glass of something to wash them down would probably help, but I can't bring myself to eat another one with the double chocolate version being so much tastier.

review/text: These are a life saver for peanut allergic kids!  I buy most of their products since my son is allergic to peanuts.  These cookies are very moist and flavorful.  The kids could finish a box in less than 5 minutes some days.  I just wish it was cheaper!  These are pricey for the small amount of cookies you get in each box.  However, it is worth the price to keep the allergic child safe when going to school and church functions.  I bring these with me to all functions to have enough for the other children as well.  Since I can not bring home made safe treats to schools anymore, these will do nicely.  Amazon has a great price too.  The chocolate ones are great too!

review/summary: Recommended Cookies
review/text: Its sometimes hard to find decent gluten-free cookies that don't taste grainy or are too dry.  This is one of the good ones.  Not only are the cookies soft, but the texture is close to the "real thing" and, if you didn't tell people, they'd probably never know they were gluten-free.<br /><br />However, if you expect them to taste exactly like a home-made snickerdoodle cookie, you will be disappointed.  They don't taste like a real snickerdoodle, but they do taste yummy all the same.<br /><br />The cookies are little, but for a small snack or for putting out on a snack table for a party, they are just the right size.  Baking your own gluten-free goodies is often the best option, but not always the easiest.  For something pre-packaged, these cookies (and the other flavors by the same maker) are a good choice.

review/text: My five year old son has just been diagnosed with egg, milk, and chocolate allergies.  He is now very limited in the items he can eat and had already aquired a taste for foods that are usually cooked with eggs and milk. We haved tried a few allergy friendly recipes and products and they tasted completely different that what he was used to.  The "Enjoy Life Snickerdoodle cookies" are one of the few things he can eat and actually loves!  I am a very picky eater, but tasted one and it was delicious! I am thankful that we have found a product that not only happens to be allergy free...but is actually tasty too!

review/summary: A delicious gluten-free, corn-free, dairy-free, nut-free treat.
review/text: I have just placed my third order. Not being one to have a sweet tooth at all but with so many allergies, I have been searching for a ginger treat for afternoon tea. After a friend made me a scrumptious hypoallergenic ginger cake, my yearning for a ginger treat was reignited. This is a soft and delicious gift and has become a staple daily treat with my honeybush/rooibos tea. I do not miss the many foods I am unable to eat but there is certainly a joy when finding a treat that is tasty and devoid of unhealthy ingredients or allergens. I have two or three cookies every day and enjoy the experience so much. I do not have the energy to bake and so ENJOY LIFE has most certainly delivered nurture with substance on so many levels.

The flavor isn't too bad, but these are grainy and there's an odd aftertaste - perhaps it's the date paste (if I remember correctly - I don't have the box in front of me). I just ate two, and I won't cry if I never eat them again.

review/summary: hope for those new to allergies
review/text: If I were to sugget one food to those that might be new to the allergy world, it would be this product.  My four year old son was just diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis, and tested positive for several allergies.  I'm so glad that I found these cookies during our first week of restricted diets.  And if you have a young child with many allergies, you probably will be grateful for the extra calories in these cookies.  I let my son have an abundance of these cookies in his diet in hopes to bulk him up a bit.  I have let other family members try them that don't suffer from allergies, and I haven't had a bad reaction yet.  They really are good.  My only warning would be that they are more muffin like than most cookies.  My four year old was a little upset when he saw these because he was expecting cookies that look like cookies.  Either way, he tried them, and he likes them.

My son says they have a little bit of a bite to them, but that is how ginger cookies are.  He compares these to the Pamela's ginger snaps.  He likes both.  But sometimes he likes to have the "soft" ginger cookies...which is the Enjoy Life type.

review/summary: Delicious Snickerdoodles
review/text: Thank you thank you for making a gluten free and casein free product that is edible!  More than edible, the snickerdoodles are delicious, soft, and yum!  Not crumbly.  I only wish that you got more per package or that each cookie were larger, but GFCF is not an inexpensive endeavor.

review/summary: You have to like soft "cookies"
review/text: I bought the "Happy Apple," "Snickerdoodles," "Double Chocolate Brownie," and "Chocolate Chip" cookies. To me, cookies should be crispy, but if you like moist cookies, these should satisfy. They improved once the package was opened and the cookies started getting stale.  My favorite was the double chocolate brownie, and I am really not a choco-holic! They just tasted good without having to be stale first. The chips inside gave it a crispier "taste." My least favorite was the Happy Apple, even though I do like apples. I have to say that these cookies were a life saver when I was hungry and there was nothing else I could eat available. I do wonder, however, if one should find out whether they are allergic to sorgham flour...

review/summary: A Little Good
review/text: A friend sent these to me.  I had been eyeing them on Amazon and other sites and wondering if they were any good, since I get tired of baking everything for myself.  This morning I decided to open them up and give them a go.<br /><br />I was surprised first to find that the cookies were packaged in 2s, each sort of glued to each other in a plastic bin.  I removed two cookies and pried one off of the other.  They were browner than the picture on the front.  And kind of sticky.<br /><br />When I first bit into one, the flavor was good.  It was cinnamony, and that's usually all I need.  I really love cinnamon.  But after that, the other flavors came in.  Something bitter.  Something like raisins (must be the dates).  The texture was fine--like a Lara Bar, I suppose--and I had no issue with that.  Yes, it's a little grainy, but after a while of eating wheat and gluten free products, you understand that you're sacrificing texture in most cases.<br /><br />The flavor is ho-hum.  If you want a snickerdoodle, I'd agree with another reviewer and say you're better off just making your own.  This isn't quite a snickerdoodle.  It's more like a cinnamon oatmeal cookie, or something with brown sugar or molasses in it.  The flavor is very dark and a bit heavy.  But if you're looking for something fast and simple and cinnamon, then this is a godsend.  I personally hate it when cookies use raisins or things like raisins to flavor them (I can always taste it), but it wasn't so overpoweringly awful in this case.<br /><br />I give this product three stars for being decent and edible.

review/text: We recently found out that my 3 year old son is allergic to gluten and casein and these cookies have been a lifesaver!  My son has a big sweet tooth and these hit the spot for him.

The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because the texture is a little different for my taste... but it doesn't bother my son at all and that is all that matters!

review/text: This cookie will fit the bill for many on restrictive diets. The only grains in it are sorghum and rice, and it contains no dairy, eggs, or nuts either. They're soft, chewy, sweet, and if your craving is for an oatmeal cookie, it will fill the bill! It falls one star short of five because it does unfortunately contain processed sugar, and occasionally the currents seem very hard.

review/summary: One star because they are soft
review/text: Oh am I absolutely heartbroken that these are so terrible.  I thought from the reviews - so many, that these would be different than all the other natural, allergy free, gluten free, wheat free blah blah blah that I've tried.  When there's one or two 5 star/4 star on this kind of product I don't order it because I chalk it up to either people who never enjoyed "fully loaded food" but have always been limited in diet and so in comparison to the other choices, they probably are good - or people like some I know who really don't care about taste, as long as it says the right thing on the package, they think it's great.  Me, I've been modifying my diet relatively recently (a few years) due to severe allergies that literally make me feel like I might not recover from the reaction to some foods I have always eaten.  Everything I eat since this started is like a cross your fingers and hope it's ok, pray while I suffer through a reaction and be thrilled when it's over, or add to the list of food I can still eat and do the "I can eat it " dance. Certain preservatives are a huge culprit but so are other things so it's always a test.  I thought maybe I found one of those nothing bad in it foods that I could tolerate and would taste good.  These are terrible -I won't know until tomorrow if I can  tolerate them but it doesn't matter, I didn't even want to finish the first cookie.  They deserve a star for being soft-that's rare in low allergen foods.  But they don't taste anything like a snickerdoodle, they taste like a day old bran muffin with cinnamon on top and you can absolutely tell that they are "nothing in it" food - if not while eating it (which is obvious to me) the after taste is an absolute giveaway, just like all the rest.  The only decent thing beyond soft is a little cinnamon taste but that can't overcome the non-sweet sweeteners that curse all allergy free products in my opinion and nothing can help the grainy texture.  I'm truly heartbroken. I want a DECENT sweet that is safe! These are so grainy, cakelike but dry - not like a glass of milk could cure it dry - just grainy dry - must be the flaxseed. It's better than some products I've tried but not edible-at least not as long as I can eat other foods.  My experience with allergy free food has not been the greatest so I try everything I can and some foods that are not free of everything are tolerated while some foods that are everything free can still give me a reaction, just less likely so I'd rather have low risk experimental food-it's just such a bummer when they aren't any good.  I envy all of you who can enjoy them, I wish I could but the taste, the aftertaste and the texture are three strikes and just too much for me.

review/summary: False Advertisement
review/text: I am pretty active in health food, conscious social circles. Buying these types of foods and supporting alternative business is important to me. HOWEVER, this company consistently markets their products in HUGE boxes with tiny cookies or bars. I think the cookies are okay, but I feel this company knowingly deceives their customers by making the product look bigger. My husband and I actually laughed when we saw how tiny these things are. Regardless of how much value you get when you buy a box (Very little in my opinion), wasting massive amounts of packaging is inconsistent with the earth conscious advertisement on the package. For that reason alone, I will not buy these again.

review/text: I give these lemon cookies 5 stars because I have no 'reactivity', which is especially important for me. I have problems with the soy lecithin, mono- and diglycerides, and the soy in malted barley flour (in unbleached wheat flour). Not hives, but this soreness/pain in my shoulder and hip that are most apparent. I can  have at least 6 or more of these with no problems.<br /><br />I love the lemon flavor!<br />They definitely do taste sweet, but not in an over-powering way. The tartness of the lemon is still there. More of an adults cookie than a kid's cookie. Soft, but not chewy, so that is nice<br /><br />I am not wowwed by the funny "bits" that are in the cookies- a textural thing. I'm not sure what those are; lemon, the nuts??? They look yellow, so probably the lemon. Again, I am happy not to be 'reactive'. I don't each them every day.<br /><br />And, between the lemon and the gluten =-free, they don't/hopefully won't kick up my recent stomach issue either.

My 5 months old was having a hard time teething which is the reason I purchase this, but by the time they got here she was doing better but she still love chewing on this, she is not able to break it yet which is great. But I think I love them more than she does, I will order some more for me :). The item was packed very well, and arrived weeks before estimated date.

review/summary: Icing Atop Crunchy Ring
review/text: It's icing, hard icing, atop a crunchy, sugary, flat cookie ring. It comes in assortment of colours, but they all taste the same. It's not bad, but it's not great either. Reminds me of how a ginger bread man tastes, but without the ginger bit.

review/summary: The jury is still out....
review/text: Was recommended this product by my acupuncturist to help with sleep and to keep the body 'regular.' Been taking Natural Calm Plus Calcium for 3 nights now. I am a small person, so only started with a half a teaspoon. I put it in Decaf Green Tea and take it before bed. It tastes fine, a little sweet. Now it's Day 3, and I don't know if this is one of those products that require 8 hours of sleep, but I feel foggy and exhausted, and have that 'sleeping pill' feeling, like I took a sleep aid but didn't sleep enough. (I sleep about 7 hours a night.) It's really not pleasant.<br />Am willing to try it some more, and will also be trying just the 'plain' Calm without the Calcium, Potassium, and Boron. Maybe those are messing with my head, not sure. Yesterday afternoon I was feeling funny, nauseous and also foggy in the head. I will say that I am sleeping more soundly at night, but to wake up feeling this groggy, and to have it last well into the morning is not fun. I will be testing more, but it seems to be doing funny things to me.

review/text: I had been waking up with cramps in my feet and calves.  I only used one scoop in my juice once a day and this product stopped the cramps within a couple days.<br /><br />I recently ran out of the Natural Calm and started using Source Naturals Magnesium Malate (I had bought both products so I could compare the two).  Within a week the cramps are back.  I also have been getting restless legs at night, which I had forgotten about when I was taking the Natural Calm.  I'm ordering more Natural Calm now.

review/summary: Fibromyalgia
review/text: I had been enduring an agonizing week-long episode of what appears to be a fibromyalgic Tetany Syndrome of excruciating pain radiating from hip-joint to knee-joint along the muscles between the joints. In trying to describe to myself the electro-convulsive nature of it, I said it appeared to be like a fibrillation - only deep in my hip, and immediately the word "magnesium" popped into my mind. Dunno why.<br /><br />Tottered out to kitchen and One teaspoon of Natural Calm and 20 minutes later the convulsive constant spasms stopped. I was free from pain and able to sleep. Have had to keep a steady repeated dosage to keep the spasms at bay and it is difficult to admit that I probably have Fibromyalgia, but thank God for a remedy to the pain.<br /><br />I've kept the Natural Calm in my cupboard because of a peculiar muscle flutter/twitch I would get around the eyes when magnesium levels were low. Know this is just an anecdotal tale, but screaming pain one moment and no pain 20 minutes later, only difference being the magnesium is a tale that needs to be told.

review/summary: Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon magnesium is good for regularity
review/text: I purchased Natural Vitality's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE">Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon 16 oz</a> as a magnesium supplement to help me absorb calcium better because I was diagnosed with osteopenia--precursor to osteoporosis.  I will have to wait until my next bone density test in about a year and a half to find out if adding this readily absorbed magnesium product has helped my bones.  In the mean time, however, it has helped with my chronic constipation.  I had been using stool softeners for the past couple of years and this works much better.  It is a powder which you mix in a cup of hot water and stir.  I usually take 5 grams (a heaping teaspoon) once a day.  After it is dissolved, I add a little cold water so I can drink it quickly, although it does taste good.

review/text: I don't usually leave product reviews, but this stuff is worthy of doing so.  I have taken magnesium supplements in various forms in hopes that they would help me get to sleep and stay asleep.  Natural Calm is the only supplement that has helped with my insomnia.  Every evening, I have a mug with a heaping teaspoon of Natural Calm in some water.  It really does help with my ability to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep all night.  I used to lie in bed and wait to fall asleep, sometimes for hours.  Now I can't even remember trying to get to sleep.  This product is wonderful!

review/summary: Good, but FAR TOO SWEET!!
review/text: I use this to calm my generally overactive system, deal with stress and sleep better, and it's not unpleasant. It's sweetened with Stevia, which I prefer to any other sweetener. One star off: it's horribly SWEET!! Most American-made sweet goods are sweet to such a degree that sometimes it's hard to detect any other taste, but even by those standards this stuff is incredibly oversweetened. I'll use it, but I wish there were another, less sweet and more natural flavor available. How about, say, mango or grape...?

review/text: I am disappointed to report that although this product did seem to have an effect on my anxiety the first time I took it, the second time I took it, it made me very nauseated. It may be the stevia; I am quite sensitive to artificial sweeteners (although I thought stevia was natural). At any rate, I am going to have to get rid of this product because I'd rather be anxious than vomiting. Call me crazy. If you are sensitive to non-sugar sweeteners, you may want to try a sample of this beforehand if you can find one before you shell out the money.

review/text: This stuff is truly amazing. Previously I had chemotherapy and the drugs took just about all the hormones away, hence giving me hot flashes. Calm helped to restore the balance and get me back on track, since I was kind of young for menopause. It has also taken my monthly cycle from 30-45 days right down to 28 days. It really is a great product. Magnesium is also wonderful for helping the body absorb calcium. I have been taking it for almost 8 months and I wouldn't think of stopping.

Not the kind of thing that knocks you out when you take it, but if you pay attention you can feel it.<br /><br />The great thing about the calcium is it is a great way to help sustain and maintain weight loss. This is the best flavor they offer no doubt about it.

It is really tart, slightly orange tasting, and I have a hard time getting it down. I have to chug it quickly. I'd rather take a pill and get it over with quickly. Just blech. I'd rather take Bluebonnet Calcium/Mag Vit D liquid, and that is a thick goopy liquid but I only need 2 TB of it. This is just hard drinking a whole glass. Aside from the texture/sense issue, the product works well, and I don't get restless legs at night. It does help me sleep and I am in a better mood since taking it.
