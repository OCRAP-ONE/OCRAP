review/text: I am not a happy camper. This website says "pure xylitol". What did I get? A box of packets that say "Xylitol Plus" which is Xylitol and Stevia. And, most of the time, I find Stevia to be nasty. So now I likely have to throw this whole box away and I am pissed. This seller is not worth your time. Go to your local health food store where you can hold the box you want in your hands.

review/summary: Better than xylitol gum.
review/text: Highly recommended for table sugar. I purchased xylitol gum for dental protection also.  But I think that putting a quarter teaspoon xylitol into my mouth and holding it there reaches far higher molar/molal (pun intended) concentrations, far higher than using gum as the delivery method.  15 pounds seemed like maybe too much until it arrived, when it seemed like not enough after giving a pickle jar full to grandpa and grandma, a jam jar full to work, several jars full to the kids, and using for most sugar uses. Feels slightly different than sugar in the mouth, seems to get very slightly cold when dissolving, tastes every bit as good as table sugar, to me a little better.

review/text: Here is the jist:  Sugar = Toxic Xylitol = Healing<br /><br />I'm not kidding. It sweetens just like sugar, feels just like sugar though a bit "lighter" in consistency. You can cook with it, bake with it, put it on cereal. And it WON'T destroy your health like sugar does. Read up on it. Its phenomenal. Some dentists promote taking if 4 or 5 times a day as it can prevent and possibly cure tooth decay. Not kidding.

review/text: I have been using xylitol by NOW for many years. It has proved to be the best tasting sugar substitute i have found. The NOW people make the Ezekiel sprouted grain bread which is a part of my daily diet. It is best bread you can eat according the famous Dr. Don Colbert and other nutritional doctors. So, I trust it. The price is good. The health food stores charge quite a bit more.

review/summary: Great product...but production needs a little more Quality Control
review/text: I've been using this product for a couple years now--one packet each morning in my coffee. I've never experienced any of the digestive issues or tasted any kind of after taste with it. The packets are convenient and easy to carry with you. My only issue is that in the last three boxes I've ordered, I've had several packets that were empty. I'm guessing something's off with their quality control in the filling process. Hopefully, they get this fixed.

review/text: I was very skeptical ordering yet another sugar subsitute that "tastes" like sugar but isn't. I was SO pleasantly surprised when I used my xylitol for the first time this morning!! It tastes just like regular sugar! It does not have that fake sugar substitute taste like Splenda and even Stevia. It's amazing that I can enjoy my coffee without the after taste that sugar substitutes leave.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who cannot use regulard sugar, but hates the sugar substitute after taste!

Two heaping spoons in 12 oz and your okay. Tastes great!

review/text: I bought this product with the intention of using it as a replacement for splenda in my baked goods. I bake with the more unconventional flours (almond, coconut, sometimes soy) in order to maintain my low carb way of eating. I love the flavor of these baked goods, but I found that I do not like the after-taste I get from the splenda. Xylitol, although more costly, seems to be my answer. I find that I do not need to use as much of it as most recipes call for either. This is a great product, worth the price.

review/text: I am not into sugar substitutes because of the potential health risks so when I use sugar it is sugar not a substitute, when I found out that this really was a natural thing I tried it and loved it. It looks like cane sugar, it tastes like cane sugar and it really sweetens twice as much  (or more) as cane sugar. I have been using for a year now and are very happy. A bit pricey but worth every penny. Diabetics will love it.

review/text: I brought some of these packets with me today so that I could sweeten my tea at work and realized that I made too much coffee for the amount of Xylitol that I had originally put into it before I took off for my commute.<br /><br />The packaging has to be 'special' because Xlyitol is pretty 'humid', in that regular paper packaging would not be optimal.<br /><br />I write this because, although it's perfect for on the go, and the packaging is pretty much 'unavoidable' in regards to properly storing and transporting it, it was a pain in the butt to open one to two packets whilst driving (I had to wait for the next stoplight or I would've veered off of the road in my struggle to open the dang things!).<br /><br />All-in-all a great product. Even after having a 'sweetened' cup of coffee, I don't have a 'fuzzy' mouth, like sugar would normally do!

review/summary: My second bag from here.
review/text: It is a proven fact that sugar increases insulin levels which can lead to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, weight gain, premature aging and many more negative side effects.In addition, xylitol does not promote an insulin response by the body. In contrast to sucrose, or table sugar, whose glycemic index is 100, xylitol's glycemic index is just six.The key to xylitol's benefits is that it helps to break down biofilms. Brushing with xylitol , chewing xylitol gum, or sucking on a xylitol pastille several times a day has an anti-biofilm effect, according to researchers. Without the protective biofilm, bacteria just can't adhere to the enamel and release corrosive substances that cause cavities. Additionally, the bacteria that cause periodontal disease have no place to hide in the gum recesses.

review/summary: Xylitol is good but Z Sweet has fewer side effects
review/text: Xylitol was recommended by my doctor to help combat a familial tendency towards diabetes. It is very much like sugar in taste and form - and offered a terrific way to deal with my preference for sweetened tea and coffee. (Several of my doctors specifically recommended that I do not use Splenda or any other artificial sweetners.)There are some gastrointestinal side effects to Xylitol however.<br /><br />A product called "Z Sweet" was introduced to me as an alternative to Xylitol ... Z Sweet uses Erythritol mixed with a bit of Stevia (though there is NO licorice aftertaste at all). Erythritol seems to have all the same advantages as Xylitol, but has fewer side effects. The taste is nearly identical - though I prefer the Z Sweet combo. If memory serves, Z Sweet/Erythritol is not dangerous to dogs.<br /><br />If you find Xylitol useful in your life, as I do, you might want to know about Eryithritol (or Z Sweet) in addition.

review/summary: Consistently Good Green Tea
review/text: I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed envelope which helps to keep their freshness.  Over a period of time, I have settled on two favorites.  These are the Darjeeling and Green teas.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F95C">Twinings Darjeeling Tea</a>:  At one time, I used Twinings China Black Tea.  Unfortunately, they stopped selling that variety.  I tried others, but chose the Darjeeling tea for an afternoon tea and snack break.  It offers a nice strong flavor and deep color.  There is enough caffeine in this tea to provide a nice lift.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAS">Twinings Green Tea</a>:  There are quite a few varieties of green tea offered by Twinings. I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.  It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />I recommend both the Darjeeling and Green varieties of Twinings teas.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I purchased after reading many reviews.  Use on face, chest and hands.  The first application was not dramatic as far as results go; but I use daily and the results are fantastic.  It took me about a week to get the impressive results.  I have very dry skin. My serums and creams were not penetrating into my skin to give me a hydrated look.  Now I can easiy tell when the serums and creams are penetrating.  My skin is much more even in color, hydrated, healthy looking.  I apply the mask work into my skin for a few seconds and leave on for 15 minutes.  Remove  in shower and use a microdermabrasion product to remove dead skin after I rinse off the mask. I use a heavy cream on my skin after my serums to seal in moisture.  The skin on my chest was pebble like and I hated it.  This product has removed that look. That took over a week to change, but wow I can wear lower cut tops now and my skin is radiant!  My hands were looking rough.  My knuckles were so dry even lotion did not help.  I use this on my hands every night, remove with a microdermabrasion product then apply a thick lotion.  Finally my hands look very nice.  I have stocked up on this product, I never want to run out.  I also use the eye treatment, spray toner (use throughout the day to freshen up makeup), body polish and body creams. Sometimes I can get lucky and find this product line in stores; but not very often.  Finally a product line that works!

My skin soaks it right in but you only need a little bit of it. I think I use less a dime-sized amount to cover my entire face. It's not greasy at all and just leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft.

review/text: I don't know how I will ever use any other face wash ever again! This cleanser is amazing! It's very light but very effective at removing my makeup (I wear Bare Minerals). Unlike other cleansers, my skin doesn't feel dry and tight after I rinse. Instead, it feels soft and moisturized so I know it's not stripping my own natural oils.<br /><br />The cleanser is clear, with a fantastic scent, that works up into a rich lather. I have not tried the Pineapple Scrub, but when I want some exfoliation, I lather up my face with the cleanser and dab on some plain white table sugar. After some gentle massage, I wash everything off and my skin feels great!<br /><br />I have combo skin with acne around the chin and cheeks and this cleanser never hurts, stings, or irritates my blemishes (unlike a lot of other products). Since my acne is mainly from resting my chin/cheeks on my hands, until that habit stops I will always have breakouts. Luckily, this cleanser works so well and now that my skin feels so good, I don't want to touch my face anymore!

review/summary: Love this product!
review/text: When I bought this I was really going out on a limb. I like to read reviews for all skin care product before purchasing. This cleanser has a surprisingly cooling effect on the skin. Reminds me of a mixture between Noxzema's foaming face wash that was discontinued and the Clean & Clear Morning Burst (which dries my face out beyond belief). I love the smell, and it cleans my Mac foundation off way better than Cetaphil. Great product!

review/summary: Fantastic exfoliator
review/text: I bought this because exfoliants with small granules were too rough on my dry skin. I got a professional facial to help with my dry skin and they recommended a fruit enzyme peel that will dissolve dry skin without being so rough. Of course they wanted me to purchase an incredibly expensive product, but I decided to do some looking on my own. I settled on this product and have been very pleased. I can use it daily without it being too harsh on my skin and it dissolves all flaky, dry skin on my face. Even using it daily or every other day, the product has lasted a while (bought it in mid-August and still going here at Thanksgiving). It smells pleasant and feels soothing on my skin. Also, I think that Amazon had this listed as a liquid, but in reality it's a thick gel.

review/summary: Love the smell, how it feels, skin looks refreshed after!
review/text: I am usually critical of skin care product that doesn't come from a dermatologist's office.  Mainly because those products and brands can have more active ingredients than store product getting better results.  This stuff is so great! I love the smell, it feels really cool and refreshing on my skin (almost like aloe), and my skin really does look shinier and refreshed after I use it.  Also, it only has to stay on for 5 minutes so it's something I can do more often than masks that require 20-30 minutes.

review/summary: The right cleanser for me.
review/text: Love this facial cleanser.  My skin tends to be oily and flaky.  I'm no longer shiny, and I've had no break outs at all since I started using it.  It takes off all my makeup without leaving my skin feeling tight and dry.  Even my skin tone is more even.  My face hasn't looked this good since my pre-teen days.  Love it.  I'm never using anything else again.

review/summary: Overpowering Smell
review/text: This cream is more for normal to oily skin rather then dry/mature skin.  It goes on nicely and gets absorbed quickly.  It leaves a nice smooth feel on your skin like the more expensive creams do.  However this cream has an overpowering sweet jasmine smell.  The smell does not fade.  People will only smell your face cream.  This could be used as face cream/cheap perfume. I thought I can get used to the smell but it's too strong and rather unpleasent.

review/summary: Amazing product for what you pay for it.....
review/text: I've used this product considerably since I've moved to a different climate.  In this climate I break out along my t-zone, which I never had an issue before, but using this product enables me to help minimize and control the breakouts.  I also notice that this product helps fade away old acne scars.. not completely, but it does help minimize the appearance.  I have combo skin, therefore I only dab it on the affected or broken out areas rather than putting it all over my face because I noticed it did dry out my dry areas.  I also use it everyday on the affected areas without any issues.  I can't answer in terms of pores, but I do feel like the next morning after applying this product my skin tone looks more even.

review/summary: MADE MY SKIN SUPER OILY THEN BEFORE
review/text: SO disappointed! I have oily, mild acne prone, sensitive, combo skin. This product DID NOT absorb into my skin AT ALL. It sat on top of my skin creating a 'slippery' greasy layer. Eww. After about 30 minutes, my skin was extremely oily, shiny & greasy looking. It looked and felt like baby oil on my face! I have oily skin but this product brought MORE excessive oil onto my face even in areas where I normally don't get oily. I don't understand how this is a oil-free moisturizer but yet makes your skin extremely oily. Glad I was able to return it!

review/summary: Burns Sensitive Skin
review/text: I bought this product because I was looking for something more natural for my sensitive skin.  Says its "gentle for all skin types" but it's not.  Literally 2 seconds after I put the first dab on my face it started burning. I could see my skin turning red and getting a rash under it.  I had to wash it off immediately.  The spot that had it does feel softer than the rest of my face, but the burning and rash is SO not worth it.  My second complaint is that it's a gel mask versus a clay mask.  I should have read the ingredients better for that one though.

review/summary: My best beauty secret!
review/text: I love this product.  I have sensitive skin, & this is really gentle & soothing.  I also try to avoid wearing foundation, but this moisturizer wears well under Physician's Formula Organic Wear Foundation.  (I haven't tried it with any other foundation products).  I exfoliate every other day & apply this afterward, as well as after getting out of the shower.  The fragrance isn't too strong, and I love that its oil free, because I have extremely oily skin.  (I obviously wash my face on a regular basis as well in addition to exfoliating.)  This is a hard product to review because people's needs, opinions, & skin types are so different.  I was initially hesitant to pay so much for it, but in comparison to other oil free moisturizers, this one is about the same cost, & isn't full of harsh chemicals, fillers, & other crap that clogs your pores up.  Just my two cents.

I'll stick with green tea & aloe.

review/summary: Effective skin tightening face mask
review/text: I've been using this face mask for years. It is much cheaper buying it online than at your local drugstore. I use it about twice a week on my entire face, but almost daily just under my eyes. I apply it there when I wake up, pre-shower. It does a nice job of tightening the baggy skin under my eyes. It's not surgery so the effect doesn't last forever but it does help. I've had no adverse reactions from using Alba Botanica Papaya Enzyme facial mask.

review/summary: Oily dilemma...
review/text: I have a very hard time finding a moisterizer.  I have a very oily t-zone while the rest of my face is dry to the point of flakey.  A word of caution if you already have oily prone skin... This created more oil.  I only used it at night and when I woke the next morning I was shoked at the sheen of oil covering my entire face.  I was disgusted.  Granted, it didn't appear to clog pores, nor make my acne worse (I am an unfortunate sufferer of that infamous adult acne around the mouth and chin area).<br /><br />A nice thing about this moisterizer is it was extremely refreshing after applying.  Especially those nights following a toner that can sometimes leave that sting behind.  I love the smell of it too.  I have since switched to only applying it outside of my t-zone, and while I still discover oil the next morning, it isn't near as bad as before.<br /><br />I am on the hunt for a new moisterizer, as I probably won't continue to use this.  Unfortunately there just aren't a lot of moisterizers with green tea, which is what I was looking for.

review/summary: Long lasting lip balm
review/text: I've been using blistex for decades, burts bees for years and I just found this in the organic section at wal mart.  I like coconut and decided to give this a try.<br />Seriously, in my pockets always are my wallet, keys and lip balm.  I've worked outdoors for years and depend upon it's protection from the elements.  Blistex is fine, but I wanted something more organic, Burts Bees is great, but I don't like their tube as much 'cause sometimes I keep this in my bra (when I don't have pockets)and it's scratchy and the peppermint is annoying at times.  (I have yet to try the others)<br />But this Coconut Cream lip balm is really amazing.  It last for a really really long time.  I put it on before bedtime and in the morning there's still some on my lips, protecting and smoothing them.  I like the feel and the flavor and will be purchasing this product for many years to come now that I have discovered it!  Invest the 3 bucks and see for yourself if it isn't better than what you're using.

review/summary: I always come back to this product
review/text: I have really sensitive skin; it reacts poorly to almost everything (including hard water), it is dry in spots and oily in others, and it definitely sees a blemish from time to time. I've tried just about every product out there because I am easily swayed by advertisements for new organic facial products, but I always come back to this line. Unlike most products for 'troubled' skin, which contain harsh salicycle acid, this product doesn't make my break-outs worse at all. It's oil free, so even after a long day my nose doesn't feel slick, and it's nice and light so it goes great under make-up. The scent is fantastic and a little jar goes a long way because you need so little of it. If your skin is like mine, I recommend the pineapple enzyme cleanser, the habiscus toner, the papaya mask, and this moisturizer. That regiment keeps me clear, soft, and smelling like the tropics. The only thing I don't use is the eye gel, which is a bit too light for the eye area.

review/summary: It is well worth buying it!!!!
review/text: This product is great it isn't drying, it leaves your skin baby smooth and hydrated I definitely can see a slight difference so far. The only thing is that I thought that it would be bigger, it is really kind of small, but a little goes a long way.

review/summary: Deep Cleansing Fruity Face Scrub
review/text: Alba's Pineapple Enzyme Facial Scrub is deliciously pineapple with hints of orange juice and dreams of coconut drinks on beaches somewhere very far from home. The tropical escape factor is very present all while the scrub works overtime to remove dull surface cells. Lavender, Aloe, Jojoba, Pineapple, Papaya, Awapuhi, Bromelain and Vitamin E are the base for this creamy cleanser enhanced with a botanical fragrance. The exfoliating granules are very mild and the aloe makes this extra soothing. After one use you can see results in tone/texture and moisture balance, after three uses, you may find yourself ordering a second tube. It is that impressive. Looking forward to trying the travel kit because the products have amazing summery scents that remind me of warm days at the beach.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Not for Sensitive Skin - Read Ingredients First
review/text: I love the Alba products because they contain lots of natural ingredients and are a great value for the price, plus I've always had good resutls with them.  I use the sea kelp products and really like them but decided to try something different for the summer, so I ordered the Jasmine moisturizer and the hibiscus facial toner.  The jasmine cream is wonderful and works great on my dry skin but, unfortunately, the hibiscus facial toner caused severe burning to my skin. After I read the entire ingredient listing, I was shocked to find this toner contains sodium hydroxide which is used in such harsh cleaning products as oven and drain cleaners.  I do have sensitive skin which, I am certain, caused the reaction.  I don't think this product is for sensitive skin, but be sure to read the entire ingredient list before you decide to purchase it, and if possible, try a sample of it first.  I went back to the sea kelp facial toner and have had no further problems.

review/summary: Great Moisturizer, Overpowered by Scent
review/text: This product moisturizes very nicely. It goes on very smooth and stays on for awhile. I really wanted to love this cream, but the smell is just so overpowering. I was expecting a soft, light scent, but this is just so strong and overpowering that it almost makes you dizzy. The smell does not diminish the longer you wear it; I put the cream on before bed, and woke up the next morning smelling like I had just put it on. It's very unfortunate, in my opinion the smell makes the cream unwearable.

review/summary: WOW
review/text: I actually ended up buying this from walmart because I was in need of an oil free moisturizer for my face...BADLY and didn't want to way 4-5 days for my order to process on here. So I purchased it (and I cringed at the thought of spending 15 bucks on a small container of moisturizer), and applied it to my clean face in the morning and before bed. Let me tell you...<br /><br />THIS THING ZAPPED MY PIMPLES LIKE NO TOMORROW!!!<br /><br />Not only did it feel nice and silky on my face, and it soaked in, but it just cleared my face up! I was so surprised. I thought it was too good to be true and maybe it happened to be one of those days that my skin decided to clear uyp on it's own. But no, I was wrong... and thank goodness. I continued using the moisturizer twice a day for a week and my face just stayed clear for the entire week. I was so happy!<br /><br />This stuff is definitely worth the money, and it WILL last you quite a long time since a little DOES go a long way. How little you ask? Just lightly, and quickly tap your finger onto the surface of the moisturizer and that's all you'll really need!<br /><br />Five stars, baby. FIVE STARS!

review/summary: Mixed feelings...
review/text: I originally tried this product because the "oil-free" caught my eye.<br />Having an acne prone skin, I thought this moisturizer would be perfect!<br />But after using this product a few times I noticed a few things...<br />CONS:<br />  -This product doesn't sink into your skin but rather stays on top and leaves your skin feeling oily and greasy.<br />  -My acne continued to break out, even more! :(<br />PROS:<br />  -Made my skin feel softer :)<br />  -Very long lasting, don't let the 3oz fool you!<br /><br />OVERALL: I stopped using this product after using about 1/4 of it. But hey, everyone has a different type of skin.<br />  If you feel that this moisturizer might be the one for you, go on and try it!

At my age "over 50" I wondered how well a moisturizer without oil would work. Surprisingly well. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I used it a few times as a body lotion as well; until I found something more practical.

review/summary: Great cleanser...but watch the eyes!
review/text: I have very sensetive skin (and very hard water!) so it's hard for me to find a cleanser that doesn't irritate or dry out my skin. Albas Pinapple face wash is gentle, cleans my face very well and has a wonderful, refreshing pineapple scent to it. A small amount worked into a lather in your hands will do the job. Why only 4 stars? It's VERY thick and needs a little extra time to wash off. I've opened my eyes in the shower a few times thinking this was rinsed clean only to find excess pineapple enzyme wash in my eyes...and it stings! This is the only face wash I've used like that which is very odd. I attribute it to its thick texture and the fact that I have very hard water. Be careful with this! Make sure it's rinsed really really well before you open up your eyeballs. Other than that, it's a great product and my favorite facial cleanser :)

review/text: Feels great on my skin. The only thing about it that bothers me at all is the smell. It's not a bad smell and it's not that strong but I'm pretty sensitive to scents. It probably wouldn't bother most people at all but you might want to be aware if you have allergies or are really sensitive to smells.  I only mention it because I suffer from migraines and scents can be a trigger for me. The product works wonderful for my skin and I love the way green tea makes my skin feel so refreshed.

review/summary: Alba face cream
review/text: I have always like Alba brand products from the standpoint that they use plant-based ingredients which are far better for the skin than the other more expensive brands found at Macy's and the like. One only needs to use about a peas-size for the face as it can be a bit oily. Overall, it's a good product that I can use right before applying my make-up and use again after washing my face. This jar will last me quite awhile, so I can appreciate that. Pleasant smell too, not overwhelming with fragrance like most facial creams.

review/summary: the best lip balm on the market hands down
review/text: I love this lip balm and have been using it for around 10 years. It is the only lip balm that thoroughly quenches my dry lips and doesnt taste like soap! Inevitably some lip balm is going to get inside the mouth when using it, and this is fine as it tastes like coconut which I love! Not only that but the ingredients are safe - its not loaded up with chemicals like most.  Its the perfect lip balm and I hope it never gets discontinued.... I simply cant go without it, and have never found a lip balm as awesome as this one!

review/summary: It's alright
review/text: It smells nice, and has a thick consistency, but rather than call it a scrub, I'd call it a cleanser ; the particles meant to be scrubbing your face aren't big enough to do much scrubbing; if you want a very,very,very gentle scrub then this may be for you, but for those of you who have used the St.Ives Apricot scrub, and want something more effective then you should look elsewhere. On the plus side, it is partially organic, and natural, and as I mentioned earlier it smells nice. I just saw a review about how it smelled like rotten pineapples, and how it caused a pimple outbreak on the reviewer-I'm guessing it was either expired, or had gone bad so don't let that scare you away from trying it-you might like it. As for me,I need something with bigger particles so maybe I'll just do a homemade scrub with sugar-or better yet, I can add a little sugar to the scrub to make it more effective. Oh, and before I forget, my face did look a little brighter after I used the scrub. It isn't allthat bad, but it's just not what I was looking for in a scrub.

review/text: My local health food stores stopped carrying any version of Oat Groats when they relocated. I finally decided to order online. This is my first time with this brand. They are excellent. Groats are the whole Kernel, unlike oatmeal in various other forms that are sliced kernels.  If you don't mind the extra cooking time it takes, you get all the flavor plus extra fiber. I like it with craisins (cranberry raisins) and a bit of Soy Milk.  YUMMY!  And the price was better than in the store. I got 2 at a time, and they were delivered in just a few days =)  I try to always go Organic + this Whole Grain, make mine Red Mill from now on.

review/text: These cups are a perfect size for a snack or lunch. It tastes exactly like the canned ravioli, which is either good or bad depending on your taste. I love that the container is not heat conductive (it is similar to stryrofoam), so it is easy to pick up and handle even when it is very hot, though you'll need to watch out for the metal ring on the lip. I wouldn't want kids heating these up on their own since they are very full and I could easily see an accident happening pulling it out of the microwave and taking the lid off.<br /><br />I keep these at work in a desk drawer for those days when i just don't have time for anything else. It is true comfort food for those of us who loved it as a kid! It would be great for a dorm room.<br /><br />The cups seem very waterproof and durable, and if worse comes to worst you could eat it without even heating, so we keep a half-dozen in our hurricane supply box.

review/text: Way too good to be a microwave meal.  I was raised on Italian food, and never thought I would like a boyardee meal.  Was I wrong!  Great taste, fills you up just right.  Try it once and you will be hooked!
