review/summary: Blue vs Red Lady Grey Tea
review/text: I ordered Twinings Lady Grey Tea 7/20/2011 for my niece.  I was disappointed as I just learned it was not Lady Grey Twinings Tea that came in the red package.  When I placed the order I was sure this is what I was ordering. Could you inform me is it available at all?  I notice now it is not shown at all on your pages.  The blue package is ok but I do prefer the tea in the red package.  Recently a friend brought some back from her trip to London.  Thank you.

review/summary: Was looking to replace TJ Dutchess Grey Tea. Way dissapointed!
review/text: The reason why I went looking for Lady Grey Tea is because in December Trader Joe's discontinued their Dutchess Grey Tea. This was one of my all time favorites. So I did some research and ended up at this product and bought the 6 pack box. It's NOTHING like Dutchess Grey. Dutchess was deep, dark and flavorful while Lady Grey is bland and kinda watery. It reminds me of 7-up actually. I'm not sure what everybody else is raving about. Anyway, if you feel you must buy it, I suggest just getting the one box to try out first.

review/text: This tea is really good for the type of tea it is.  A friend mentioned how this was the best tea she's ever tried so I gave it a shot.  Unfortunately. I tend more towards flavored teas, therefore the 4-star rating.  In my opinion, the Ahmad Peach & Passion Fruit Black Tea cannot be beat.  That is by far my most favorite tea.

review/summary: Great Quality Cat Food
review/text: We are breeders of sphynx (hairless) cats. Prior to Natural Balance, the only way we could get our cats to eat dry food was to mix it with warm water and a half can of canned cat food, usually Iams or Friskies when money was low. Our local feed store recommended Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance as a healthy and tasty alternative. Our adult cats love it...no more "hunger strikes" holding out for canned food. Even our kittens started eating it at only 8 weeks, when mixed with a bit of warm water. Since there are no 'fillers', the cats are eating less to become full, which to me justifies the higher price. EDIT NOVEMBER 2011: Six years later, this is the only food we buy for our cats and they still love it.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: Some time ago I started looking into what is in pet food and was horrified, so I decided to find better food for them.  I usually buy one bag of this brand and one bag of AvoDerm and mix them together.  I've long been a believer that cats should eat fruits and vegetables, and this food has some of both in it, so they get more variety than they would with most cat foods.<br /><br />I'm not sure of what changes the cats may have had since eating this food, but it does seem like the food lasts longer than it used to.  Whatever the case, the cats are all healthy and love this food.  One of the cats has gained a few too many pounds since she got spayed a couple years ago, so I'm going to get the reduced calorie formula for her and see if that helps.

review/summary: 4 happy cats
review/text: I recently switched to this brand for dry and wet and Castor&Pollux's dry food. Since they all like the gravy based wet foods, I do add water to the canned food which they then happily devour. My 17 yo cat is very overweight, has bad teeth which cannot be cleaned again due to his age. Otherwise the vet thinks he's healthy. By accident I stumbled on some web based cat food reviews and was appalled at what I had been feeding my babies. I was naive in thinking Purina was healthy food. Since making the switch they all eat less although there is no  change in the litterboxes. For now I'm sticking to these brands and possibly adding Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul brand as they really enjoy the sample bag as bedtime treats.

review/summary: Healthy and high quality food that my cat loves
review/text: I got my kitten through a rescue group when he was about 7 months old. He had been a stray and was very thin, had bad breath, diarrhea, poor coat and missing hair on his ears. He has been on this Natural Balance dry food for the last seven months or so and he's now a very healthy 14 pounds, has a gorgeous shiny coat, no diarrhea, his breath is good and has a great energy level. It's hard to believe he's the same cat. I'm very happy with this food and so is he. He loves the taste and never gets tired of it. Yes, it's a little more costly than buying the generic brand of cat food at the grocery store but I save on vet bills because my cat is never sick. I have tried other brands of food, but he prefers the taste of this one and I'm happy he's doing so well on it.

review/summary: Wonderful Dry Food My Cat Loves
review/text: And more importantly, it loves my cat.  I am the owner of a new cat that I started out on a supermarket indoor cat formula, since he had been fed dry food while at the shelter.  While the cat ate this other food heartily, he soon began vomiting on a daily basis.  I did some research on the internet and found that this food, Natural Balance, is considered to be among the best cat foods out there of the dry variety.  Since my cat would not really touch wet food at the time, I decided to give it a try.  Not only did my cat love it, but all of his problems with vomiting disappeared overnight.  I am currently feeding him a combination of Natural Balance Original dry and a variety of wet foods.  He is doing great so far...lots of energy...and he really looks forward to mealtime.  My cat and I recommend this food!  :)

review/summary: My cat didn't like it
review/text: Per pound, more expensive than canned tuna, pork roast or steak. Ended up giving my purchase to neighbor's dog, because my cat wouldn't eat it. "None" of those 'designer' cat foods are worth their price.<br /><br />If protein is so important in your purchase decision, buy steak, (per pound) it's cheaper. Base your pet food purchase on logic, not guilt.

The flakes are just a little thicker than your normal mainstream flake, and are wonderful in milk or munching alone (which i find that i do as I'm preparing my bowl of cereal).

Try a box from your local store, and then come back to Amazon and order the case, because you'll save a lot and you'll eat through it pretty quickly.  ENJOY!!!!

review/text: I have purchased this cereal by the case for years because it is that good. When I ordered this at the end of February 2012, we thought I ordered the wrong thing as there was a definite change. Thinner flakes, less flavor, and not as sweet. Not that this cereal is very sweet anyway, but there was just a hint of sweetness that was perfect for eating without feeling the need to add any sugar to it. Why in the heck did they mess with perfection? Now it's just OK, nothing special. Might as well eat mostly flavorless Total because that's what it reminds me of now.

All those soggy spoonfuls of cardboard sludge?<br /><br />Well, Nature's Path Heirloom Whole Grains Cereal ACTUALLY stays crunchy!<br /><br />Around about the time of my third box of the Heirloom cereal, the phone rang just as I was pouring milk over it.

Imagine my pleasant surprise when I spooned a mouthful of cereal - and found that it was still crunchy! Top that with all the fiber and good taste, I've become a Nature's Path devotee. (So has my daughter, who orders three of their other cereals on a regular basis.)<br /><br />Don't you just love it when you find a product that lives up to it's claims?

I opened the fifth box and tried to eat the cereal and noticed there was a chemical taste much like biting into a medicinal pill inadvertently. I sent a message to the Nature's Path people concerning the contamination and have yet to hear back. Being that this product is a "natural" product, there should be NO POSSIBILITY FOR CHEMICAL contamination in the processing of this product. This is perhaps the first time in my life that I have ever returned a product for any type of contamination. I believe it says volumes about the essential BS that natural products are perceived as safer than regular products.

At Amazon's price for a 12-package carton, moreover, this superb mix (with super saver shipping) would cost at least 30 cents less per box than at our local grocery store. And we do love it.<br /><br />But that's still more than 43 cents per ounce, and a local supermarket now carries a fantastic basmati, wild rice and vegetable medley in 16-ounce packages. The latter costs more than 70% less. Admittedly, Near East's Long Grain & Wild Rice Pilaf tastes better than the basmati and wild rice mix, which does not include any spices.<br /><br />But we can add our own spices. It's hard to argue with the savings. Except for rare occasions, we have switched off Near East to the far less costly brand.

review/text: I've been a fan of this rice for years, and I was having trouble finding it in the stores.

review/summary: Wonderful Sugar Free Flavoring! Highly Recommended
review/text: The Kahlua Flavor is one of my favorite DaVinci Sugar Free Flavored Syrup types. This was a great find for me since I am a Type 2 diabetic and really have an overpowering sweet tooth.<br /><br />We have tried quite a few of the different brands on the market, but have settled back to DaVinci since the flavors are good and they are sweetened with Splenda. Several of the other brands use Sorbitol (which my wife is slightly allergic to) or Maltitol (which causes me "gastric distress" in large quantities).<br /><br />The real test for anything sugar free is if my kids will use it, and they all like the flavor enough to go out of their way for it. We have used this in coffee and in baking with great results.<br /><br />Highly recommended

review/text: Though the chocolate egg cream is considered the "default" egg cream I find  the vanilla egg cream even better. The essential ingredient in both is Fox's U-Bet  syrup. The nuanced delicacy of this SUPERB product is so splendid that it renders all other brands redundant. If I have an egg cream as my aperatif at luncheon I find that it insults my palate. I have found that  the U-Bet vanilla egg  cream is perfect for cocktail time or as a morning wake up drink. For diversity I will sometimes use Fox's equally splendid chocolate syrup--and to be able to order it online! A blessing! I think it was Voltaire or perhaps SJ Perleman who said "A life with Fox's U-Bet vanilla syrup is a life lived in vain"

review/summary: NO MORE RASPBERRY FLAVOR IN Celestial Seasons Raspberry Gardens
review/text: I am a long time lover of Celestial Seasons tea, and loved Raspberry Gardens Green Tea until this shipment.  They changed the formula of this tea and their other fruit flavored green tea to taste more like green tea.  Doesn't make sense to me, the reason people buy flavored teas is for the flavor.  I love the benefits of green tea but not so crazy about the flavor so I tried and purchased several green tea brands and flavors.  I spoke with Celestial Seasons and they decided to change the blend to make it more of a green tea flavor.  If that is what we want we would just purchase their green tea with no flavor blends.  Very disappointing.

review/text: Let me say, the first time I tasted Celestial Seasonings Raspberry Gardens Green Tea, I was in heaven.  Had I written this review then, when the tea was a lovely shade of transparent red-purple with a light blackberry flavor, I would have given it 20 stars.  But according to Celestial Seasonings Customer Support, they have changed the recipe, removing the hibiscus and blackberry and leaving that delightful "Mr's Yuk's Bathwater" flavor in it's place. I kid you not.  The tea is now a sickly yellow green with less hint of raspberry now, than before.  The box still looks the same, and the ingredients list still includes hibiscus and blackberry - but it's a lie!  Let the drinker beware.

review/text: I ordered two cases for my Mom who loved (past tense) this tea.  They really did not improve this product like they claim.  They took out the Hibiscus and added white tea "for a smoother taste".  It does not have the fantastic raspberry taste it used to have at all.  Now we have two cases that nobody wants to drink.  I did manage to scour my local grocery stores (7-8 of them) and find the last 5 boxes in my area.  All I can say is that I/we hope that Celestial Seasonings comes to their senses and goes back to the original formula.  And yes we did contact Celestial Seasonings and make complaints with them.  Why do companies have to go and mess up a good thing?

review/summary: Needs more raspberry!
review/text: Raspberry Gardens contains healthful green tea, which is known to provide many health benefits such as providing antioxidants which help mitigate the problems of aging, and assisting with weight loss.  The aroma of this tea is raspberry as advertised.  The flavor is tart and flat--dominated by hibiscus.  Raspberry flavor is very faint.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. They put a caffeine meter on the box to compare this tea with cola and coffee beverages-this tea has 15 mg of caffeine compared to 90 in a cup of drip coffee.  The level of antioxidants would be a good addition. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box: "The friend who holds your hand and says the wrong thing is made of dearer stuff than the one who stays away."  Barbara Kingsolver.

review/text: I have never had the previous version everyone raves about in the reviews here, so I am giving an unbiased review of this tea. I seeped for 3 minutes and didn't add any sugar or anything. It smells deliciously like raspberries and it definitely has a raspberry taste. The color is light green/yellow so I know it's not the old version. This tea is veryyyyyyy good. I am very picky when it comes to this stuff. It's so sweet tasting and soothing that I made myself another cup. Reading the other reviews, I can definitely see how a more stronger raspberry taste would make this tea even better, that's why I am knocking a star off. I can imagine this tea tasting better so I think the other reviews are correct. If you've never had this tea before, like me, you won't be disappointed. If you've had the old version and try this one, you WILL be disappointed. I hope they change it back to the old formula so I can try it and see what everyone's talking about. I also think that reddish color everyone talks about would make this tea even better, the color of this tea is ugly.

review/summary: Your own mocha and it won't cost you $5 per cup
review/text: Here you have an excellent tasting product that isn't THAT bad for you - even the carb-conscious folks. One serving has 28g of sugars and 2g of fiber - yes, fiber even. That's 4 tablespoons. I, personally, only need 2 so cut that in half, which is the same sugars as a light yogurt.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the best part. If you are like me and have grown addicted to the sweet tasting mochas from any of the number of specialty coffee places out there (Tully's, Peet's, Starbucks, etc.), but you hate paying $4-$5 for your fix, check this out.<br /><br />Buy your favorite coffee (I like Peet's house blend myself) and brew your regular coffee. Yes, you don't need a $1,000 espresso machine to do this. Add 2-4 tablespoons of "Ghirardelli Hot Chocolate Mix , Chocolate Mocha" to a large, dry cup (I use 2), pour in your hot coffee. Mix thoroughly. Now, add your favorite creamer (I like Mocha Mix light or nonfat lactose free milk). Stir. And, you have yourself a darn good mocha w/out the espresso machine hassle or the cost.<br /><br />Now, throw it in your favorite spill-free travel coffee cup and head off to work bypassing the unsuspecting grumpies standing in line for 10-minutes waiting to pay $5 for their chocolaty caffeinated beverage. Just smile knowing now you have an extra $100+ per month for something else.<br /><br />Excuse me whilst I take another sip of mine.

review/summary: Quick, Easy and Among the Most Delicious Dessert Drinks.
review/text: I used to make a Mocha Caf&eacute; au Lait on the stove with milk, melted chocolate, coffee, sugar, and seasonings. It was a delicious flavorful alternative to equally delicious homemade hot cocoa for special occasions. I have never been satisfied with easy or "instant" methods of making plain hot cocoa. They just can't compete with the richness of heavy cream and melted chocolate. But my Mocha Caf&eacute; au Lait met its match in Ghirardelli's Chocolate Mocha. This is a wonderful powdered mix of chocolate, vanilla, and coffee.<br /><br />The instructions tell you to mix 3 tablespoons of Ghirardelli's Chocolate Mocha with 8 oz (1 cup) of milk, heat, and serve. I find that 2 tablespoons with 2/3 cup of milk fills the average cup or mug. And I always use half-and-half instead of milk. Topped with sweetened whipped cream, this makes a decadent, filling dessert that rivals homemade and restaurant beverages and is attractive enough to serve to guests. Serve with a spoon for those who like to eat the whipped cream before it all melts into the chocolate.<br /><br />Ghirardelli provides microwave and stovetop directions. The microwave instructions advise heating the milk for 1-1 1/2 minutes before adding the Chocolate Mocha mix. I don't think the 2-step process is necessary, but if you've ever tried to heat milk or half-and-half in a microwave, you know how quickly it can get out of hand. One second nothing is happening; the next second the milk has bubbled all over the floor of your oven, leaving little in the cup. If you want to heat the hot chocolate in the microwave, you can add the Chocolate Mocha mix before you heat the milk, but don't take your eyes off of it once you start heating. If you see any bubbles, stop the microwave immediately, stir the drink, and heat more as necessary. Keep doing that until it's hot enough for you.

review/summary: Not my cup of Cocoa
review/text: Very bitter!  I couldn't taste the coffee at all.  It basically tastes like baking cocoa.  No sweetness, no richness, not coffee.  I bought the 4 pack though, so I've begun mixing it half and half with Swiss Miss (in the can), and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after I've made a cup.  Even making it with whole milk couldn't make this yummy by itself.  If you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee.... shop elsewhere.

review/summary: Nasty after-taste!  This cocoa is truly bad.
review/text: Ghiradelli has developed a name as producing high-quality chocolate products. But SORRY, in the case of this cocoa, the emperor has no clothes!<br /><br />I went to my local grocery, and since Ghiradelli hot-chocolate is one of the most expensive brands... I figured it was also going to be the best-tasting.  Boy, was I wrong!<br /><br />This cocoa has a nasty after-taste.  There is no smooth, chocolate flavor whatsoever.  I threw out the entire container because I found it to be undrinkable.<br /><br />I would recommend just about any brand before Ghiradelli.  I just don't understand the hype.<br /><br />Here are the hot-chocolate and cocoa brands I WOULD recommend:  Marie Belle, GODIVA, and even "Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf" all make great-tasting hot chocolate/cocoas.  Take it from a true CHOCO-HOLIC like me!

review/summary: Why buy so much sauce?  Because hoisin.
review/text: Shoppers looking at this item will likely be asking themselves the same thing I did when I saw this on Amazon: "What on earth am I going to do with all of this sauce?"<br /><br />You cook like hell and get creative is what you do.  Once you taste it, you will find things to use it for.  While there are better, richer, and ultimately more expensive hoisin sauces out there, Lee Kum Kee brand's ultimate strength is in inexpensively lending itself to being a solid, yet mutable base for flavoring your dishes and soups.  Add some onion powder to make a great barbecue sauce alternative.  Some rice wine, ginger, and crushed red pepper flakes for a unique marinade that has punch.  With sesame oil for a great stir fry.  By itself as a dipping sauce for steamed buns.  You get the idea.<br /><br />I've made a lot of great dishes in the time I've had this sauce, from hoisin infused meatballs, hoisin+honey glazed slow roasted pork shoulder, to just being a simple flavoring for Vietnamese pho noodle broth.  You will find many great things to use it for too if you are adventurous and have the pantry space.  It's very easy to work with and modify to your taste.<br /><br />Six 36 ounce bottles is a lot of sauce. But it beats paying upwards of $5 a pop for small dinky and dusty bottles at the supermarket, particularly if you don't have any asian stores where you live.  Never cooked asian food before?  It's ok, this is where you begin.

review/summary: Authentic chinese out of the bottle
review/text: Just add this to your lo mein or other chinese recipe for authentic restaurant taste.  I use some soy, ground ginger, msg (yes I like the taste of it and my arms haven't dropped off yet) along with a little garlic and onion powder and of course some roasted sesame seed oil.  The starter mixture is the basis for quite a few fine chinese dishes and the amounts of each can be adjusted to suit your taste.  A few lo mein noodles, some shrimp or chicken or beef bits and you're quickly able to make a very tasty authentic lo mein.  I don't use this in my fried rice, though but it is good in stir fried vegies, etc.

review/summary: Excellent sauce
review/text: I use hoisin sauce in many recipes as a key base ingredient. Mix in some garlic and  ginger and a good soy sauce like sempio 501s and you have a great flavor base or combination for any asian cooking application. Be aware the 36 ounce container is a net weight not a fluid ounce size. Hoisin sauce is heavy by natural weight of ingredients and if you use it frequently this size may not be as much as you think. There is approximately three 8 fluid ounce cups per 36 ounce bottle. I just used an entire bottle making a marinade and a dipping sauce at one shot. This sauce is very good tasting and fits the bill nicely. The price is not too expensive nor is it cheap, it is reasonable. The bottle is plastic and squeezable and much easier to deal with than those ubiquitous small overpriced supermarket glass jars. Since the sauce is so heavy and slow moving like heavy ketchup try upturning the bottle so the sauce sinks to the cap when it is upside down and you will get the last drop. Good sauce, good value....recommended

review/text: My wife decided at that last moment that she was going to put a dish together for our guest the very next day. The product was not available locally, so I went to Amazon and found every item that was needed to prepare the dish. Again, because of Amazon's shipping options I was able to receive the ingredients on time for the evening of the meal. Did I pay more, yes. Did I need as much as it came packaged, no. But it worked out because, I expected to pay more for our mistake of not having on hand the proper ingredients, plus our guess liked the meal and we were able to share the extra quantity with them, along with the receipt, so it all worked out.

review/summary: Iranian Style?
review/text: I purchased several different saffron's from Amazon and a local store to taste and sample.  This was of interest because it stated it was Iranian.  Having read that Iranian saffron was of the best in the world I was intrigued.  However, when received the label stated "Iranian Style". This was disconcerting. This is quoted from the product description:  "You will get about 500 saffron threads with this one gram purchase. We are known throughout Florida and the USA to have some of the finest quality Iranian saffron around! Since it is illegal to import saffron from Iran to America we have worked hard to source some of the finest Iranian style saffron from the nutrient dense lands of New Zealand, France & Greece."  Unfortunately I had not read this prior to ordering.  If it is not Iranian, why say it is?  Or at a minimum be consistent in the representations.<br /><br />To be fair I would say that it is good saffron, at least based on my limited saffron expertise, and compares favorably to the others I had ordered.  I am cooking with it and also taking it as a supplement having read of the clinical study proving saffron's efficacy in treating depression compares favorably to a leading pharmaceutical.<br /><br />Nevertheless there is a feeling of unease about the transaction which I thought to share.

review/summary: Prosciutto Americano Better Than Parma
review/text: I first tried this Prosciutto at Mario Batali's Pizzeria "OTTO" in NYC, and then a couple of weeks later, I found it again at his restaurant Lupa.  Mario Batali, for those of you who don't know, is the renowned Italian chef from Food Network with the long orange pony tail.  His two Italian restaurants are always ranked #1 and #2 in New York City, year after year.  He is known for his love of Italy, Italian food, and ALL THINGS ITALIAN.  However, in his own restaurants, he has begun serving La Quercia Prosciutto di Americano... Simply because it is better.  You must try this prosciutto if you like this meat.  MUST TRY.  It is simply the best prosciutto I have ever eaten (probably the best pig meat I have ever eaten, better than bacon, dare I say), and trust me, I have eaten a lot of pig.

review/summary: Excellent dog chew!
review/text: This is a great product. My dog is infatuated with this antler chew. I picked the antler that is split down the middle because he is older and not a strong chewer. He is very happy gnawing at the exposed marrow. If your dog is a strong chewer I would recommend getting the antler that is not sawn down the middle.  The intact antler would last longer. This product does not make a mess as there are no dyes.  It does not splinter like bone, or get gooey like rawhide.  I don't have to clean bits of goo off my dog when he is done chewing.  I will buy this again (and again).

review/summary: Best antler product I've found, but not quite as durable as I expected
review/text: I've tried deer antlers.  Some were great, others splintered into sharp shards that scared me.  I tried a whole elk antler ($30).  It was durable, all right, because after my dogs figured out they couldn't get to much of the marrow, they lost interest.  But all of them LOVE this antler.  They can grab onto it easily and scrape at the marrow.  They all love it so much I have to be careful that they don't fight over it.  However, one of them has managed to wear away the outer shell.  She is a pit bull, but she's not an unusually powerful chewer.  Still, I would recommend this antler.  The pieces they wear off are small, not sharp shards like the deer antlers, and it keeps them busy for a while and seems to satisfy their chewing needs better than artificial chew toys.

review/text: I have a young shepherd dog and a senior terrier dog with other dogs in the family from a small maltese to big labs and huskies. ALL of the dogs love these split antlers. My young dog enjoys regular antlers but they take her a long time to get into and she gets bored of them after chewing for awhile. She goes and picks this up almost anytime she's ready to lie down. The other dogs won't chew regular antlers but love the split kind. I love that it keeps the dogs blissfully out of trouble and is long lasting.

review/summary: Great for medium-sized chewers
review/text: Our 35 lb dog has been a chewer since she was born. We tried her on antler burrs I purchased at a dog show, but they proved a little too hard for her, and she lost interest quickly. I ordered the sliced antler hoping that she'd find it a little more accessible. It arrived the day after I placed the order (lightening-fast shipping!) and she's been gnawing at it ever since. The product was listed as roughly 9 inches long, so I'm pleasantly surprised that the one that came was a little over 10.<br /><br />Our dog loves it. If we let her have it 24/7, it would have been gone within the first day. As it is, it looks like it will last about 2 weeks total. Owners with larger dogs or more aggressive chewers may want to order something stronger.

She was a chronic chewer and had a destructive side when she did not have a chewy that she liked.<br /> I tried Kongs nylabones etc and she wanted nothing to do with them and decided that ripping dog beds and other things would be alot more fun.<br /><br />I am not saying this antler solved the problem but she would chew on for hours and did not destroy anything else if she had this with her to chew on.<br /><br />I am planning on buying another for my new pup as she seems interested in the full antler but you should always start with quarter or sliced first so they understand what to do with it.

review/summary: Great Concept
review/text: The antler we received is larger than I expected -- too big/heavy for my mini schnauzer, but would be great for a lab or boxer sized dog.  The good/bad thing about this chew is that it's sterile; I feel good that it's been cleaned and is safe for my dog, but my dog shows little interest in it.  Our friend's dog, however, was very pleased with it, though he shows no interest in his own antler chew (which isn't split).  I think there's something to dogs wanting to access the marrow.<br /><br />I'm going to leave it my dog's treat jar for a week or so and hope that it absorbs enough scent to catch my little guy's attention.  If it does, I'll be grateful because this chew will be way more durable and long-lasting than any other chew.

review/summary: "Classic" is much better!
review/text: I agree with some of the other reviewers (for the NON-Classic syrup). I have been buying this product, mostly to add to coffee, for several years. At some point, I noticed that the flavor changed, and (to my palate at least), it was a change for the worse. After noticing some of the recent reviews, I made sure to order the "Classic" flavor when my supply started to run low. When it arrived, I taste-tested vs. the "non-Classic" syrup that I still had on hand, and (again, to my palate), the "Classic" tasted far superior. I suppose other people may prefer the new flavor, but for me, the Classic is the one I'll order from now on.

review/summary: Wax Mustaches are Fun!!
review/text: Bought these to complete our cowboy birthday party costumes.  They are so fun!  Kids and adults loved posing for pictures- which never happens!  They taste pretty good too- grape flavor.  Would definitely buy again!

review/summary: A 'Stache of a Good Time
review/text: These little suckers were handed out as favors and they were enjoyed to the fullest!!  Everyone was wearing them and taking photos.  They're lots of fun and taste like grape (thankfully, because I thought it would be black licorice - gag).  They have a little wax tab you can bite to hold the mustache in place.  They're totally edible (I don't think you'd want to swallow the wax ball that chewing them creates!!  but they taste pretty yummy).<br /><br />Highly recommend these bad boys!

review/summary: No Filler Nuts
review/text: This is one of my favorite nut mixes: cashews, pecans and almonds.  There are no peanuts, no brazil nuts, etc.  It is a nice combination of flavors and textures.  If you like those three nuts -- and I do-- this is a good mix to get.
