review/summary: Yes, kitties, there is a Nip for that!
review/text: My kitties love catnip so I've tried many products over the years. This product is the best! You can use as little or as much as you want, without huge bags with dried catnip, which lose its flavor rather quickly.<br />Just spray a little on the kitty's favorite toy and watch her having fun with it! Just make sure not to spray on your hands or the kitty will be *very* friendly with you for a while.<br /><br />I always spray the same toy at the same place to be consistent. One of my kitties (the smart gray tubby) asks for it! She leads me to her bed (where the toy is), lies next to it and meows. Then I spray the toy and she dutifully starts purring, licking it and generally going bunkers.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Hey, They LIKE it...They REALLY LIKE IT!
review/text: OK, So I bought the SmartyKat CatnipMist because it received a couple of decent reviews and it was one tenth the cost of "From the Field" Catnip Essential Oil Rejuvenator. Well, you know what they say, "If it's too good to be true, it is too good to be true."<br /><br />SmartyKat CatnipMist just didn't work with my two cats. They sniffed it and then just walked away. They weren't remotely interested.<br /><br />But, "From the Field" Catnip Essential Oil Rejuvenator REALLY does work. My cats love it. They sniff it, they hang around it, they roll in it, they wrestle and play with each other. That's what catnip is supposed to do. The only downside (but, it wasn't worth giving the product 4 stars instead of five stars) is that From the Field is costly. Well, you know what they also say..."You get what you pay for."<br /><br />My cats don't care what it costs. They're CATS! I'll stick with "From the Field" Catnip Essential Oil Rejuvenator.

review/text: This is powerful stuff!  My cats really enjoy this, better than regular catnip, stronger than catnip spray you get at a local pet store! One of my cats does not like fresh catnip, she likes it after it has been out of the package a while, but she LOVES this stuff.  It lasts, cats are going after places I sprayed this on days after I sprayed it.  A must have if your cats like catnip!

review/summary: Absolutely works!
review/text: Like one of the other reviewers, I bought this because it was the only spray that seemed to have any really good reviews.  Let me tell you that this stuff REALLY works.  As soon as I spray it on her scratching posts or kitty condo, my cat starts going crazy!  Tonight she actually started to lick the scratching post after I sprayed it (not really the desired effect, but an indication of how much she loves the spray).  While 1 oz doesn't seem like a lot, it seems like it will go far if you're not spraying it daily.  I'm not sure yet how long the scent lingers, but the initial spray gets quite a crazy cat reaction.  Highly recommended if you want a spray to attract your cat to a particular area in your house.

review/summary: Look no further
review/text: I don't own any cats but I got this for my friends cats (who I think are awesome). The cat nip they normally use was getting a bit old and wasn't working as well as it used to. I wanted to get the kitties something nice for Christmas, so I looked on YouTube and saw some videos for cat nip spray. It looked like it worked pretty well on the videos.<br /><br />After looking at reviews for other products, I was hesitant. This was the only 5 star product and despite there being only 2 reviews I decided to take a chance. I am glad to say this product did not disappoint.<br /><br />As soon as I recieved the spray I pumped it a couple of times to prime it and I sprayed it ONCE on accident. No big deal, right? Litterally, one minute later: here come the kitties from the other room. THEY LOVED IT! I don't think I have ever seen them this playful on ONE ACCIDENTAL spray.<br /><br />I sprayed a couple of new toys that I also purchased through AMAZON. Again, one pump was plenty and they went nuts yet again! I wish I had taken a video of it to put up on here. I would definately purchase this product again. If you love to crack out your kitty then look no further. You will not be disappointed.

review/text: My three cats come running as soon as they hear the "spritz" of the catnip on their toys.  And they love it.... until it dries.... and then the attraction goes away - quickly.  Too bad, because "it's good while it lasts" it just doesn't last very long.  I've tried a heavier spray, but with the same result.  So, I'll keep looking for something that provides a little longer "high" for them.

review/text: The perfect flour for wood fired pizza. It might not work as well in a kitchen oven since it tends to NOT brown unless the heat is very high(800+ degrees F) In that case mix with up to 50% bread flour and you will get that brown crust. This flour makes a lighter almost puffy dough that stretches well. With the addition of bread flour, the dough is a little chewier and will brown at lower temperatures.My family loves the texture and flavor using this new dough in my standard recipes. I am still experimenting with additions, Like BF, for texture and flavor.

review/text: My grandson wanted a lizard birthday cake this year.  I had every intention of actually hand-piping a big lizard on the cake.  I purchased these gummy geckos as party favors, but when I saw them I decided to use them on the cake.  I used several to form a big "6" on the cake; I got such a kick out of them that I decided to use them as cake borders as well.  All I did was use icing to add eyes to each gecko - very cute.  I had plenty left over for favors, and even have a few to give out for Halloween.  A fun purchase that went a long way.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, the kids loved the sour flavor!

review/summary: My favorite of all ... "Comfort Food for the soul"
review/text: When this first came out, I actually used it by heating up water in the in-room coffeemaker while in a hotel room while I was on a week-end vacation. The vacation was extra-special, and every time I sipped a cup it brought back warm memories of a special weekend. I kept it in my cupboard and treasured it for stress-filled days.<br /><br />Sadly, when I moved, I was no longer able to find this particular blend, and I have missed it desperately. So now, with my "pack of 6" I am set for winter AND a lot of wonderful memories. OR, if I need more, I can always re-order ... and re-order ... and re-order. :-)<br /><br />If you have never had it, there is a distinct Cinnamon flavor mixed in with the chocolate, which gives it both a unique scent (ummmm), and a gentle flavor of cinnamon mixed in with the mocha flavoring. If this sounds tasty to you, it will be, but if you want a plain mocha flavoring, this won't be your cup of cappuccino.<br /><br />My vote - 5 stars.

review/text: I originally tried Caffe D'Vita's jumbo cappucinno can available at Costco and loved it but when I moved out of California found my local Costco in Sequim, WA didn't carry it.  Frantically I tried the Costco suggestion box to no avail so I went to the Caffe D'Vita web site and ordered direct from the manufacturer!  The price is higher in 16OZ canisters but there are several more flavors to choose from including Cinnamon Mocha, Hawaiian Mocha, Pumpkin Spice, Mint Chocolate, Chocolate Rasberry, Amaretto and Orange Mocha.  There are a few other flavors but I don't recommend them due to personnal tastes.  In any event Caffe D'Vita is a terrific alternative and better value compared to the french vanilla cans you see in most grocery and box super stores.<br /><br />My favorites are Hawaiian Mocha, Cinnamon Mocha and the Cappucino.

review/text: These taste like inexpensive cracker and "cheese" packs.  Actually the inexpensive packs taste and handle better than these do.  These consist of two bland, sturdy (i.e., hard) rectangular crackers with a bland soft filling.  So when you bite into them, the cracker parts snap into shards and the soft filling is squished out of the sides from the pressure of biting.  They aren't even filling, not nearly as much as one of those cheap packets are.  I really felt like this was one of the worst rip-off product concepts I'd fallen for in quite a while.  It's all excessive packaging and marketing nonsense.

Imagine my horror in finding tonight that the price of the product has almost doubled. I am so disappointed.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />This is a fairly new product. I life in a rural town and although we have a couple of big stores, one variety, one grocery, they seem to never have this product on the shelves. There are different flavors, but this is my favorite, and must be a lot of other people's favorites too.  What I love is the fact that I can get this terrific product, at a comparable price, and have it delivered right to my door. No frustration.<br /><br />The product itself makes a healthy, fiber filled snack or even a light lunch.<br /><br />Ritz has done well, but this is the most popular flavor of crackerfuls, so they need to make sure the stores have more of this particular type.<br /><br />Thank you AMAZON.com for providing me this way to order this great product.

First, I tasted one mushroom right from the oven, then I waited until they cooled before the next attempt.  Then, I waited one hour and tasted the product again.  There was absolutely no taste.  I couldn't discern a crab taste or aroma; nor could I sense the taste of mushrooms.  I  felt like I had a mouthful of tasteless bread crumbs.  I'm not willing to ingest a boatload of calories while experiencing no taste, so I threw the entire tray of 9 mushrooms into the garbage.

I enjoy the scent of natural coconut.<br /><br />Though these shrimp are edible, the coconut aroma and subsequent taste overpower anything else. Even from the oven, the only thing that I can smell is coconut. When eaten, they leave a strong aftertaste that for a while makes one wonder if by mistake you consumed a coconut-scented wax candle by mistake. This holds true even when drenched with cocktail sauce to try to drown out the coconut.<br /><br />I cannot imagine that the overpowering odor is natural coconut, which I find to be pleasant. One of the listed ingredients is "Artificial Flavor," which likely means that Omaha Steaks attempted to "enhance" the flavor in some way. Unfortunately, I can't tolerate the resulting smell, which is an integral part of the perceived flavor when eaten.<br /><br />In short, if you're a huge coconut fan, or if your sense of smell is inoperative, then these might be for you. If you are an occasional consumer of coconut, then proceed with great caution.

It comes close to Pepsi but of course not a bull eye just like cola syrups can't be Coke, both Coke and Pepsi own the recipes for their drinks. Now that said this is  a very good tasting syrup and not a hard or sweet taste like other cola syrups but more mild flavor. My sister is a big Pepsi drinker and she likes this lot more that other cola syrups, she doesn't like Coke. I think we will be sticking with, it seems this is the only syrup trying to be like Pepsi. Again got the package in great shape and very fast, just wish the shipping could be lower. So if you're not a Coke drinker and want a syrup more like Pepsi, you found it!

review/summary: I love my Naked Green Machine
review/text: This product is fabulous. It contains ingredients that my blender would not get fine enough for me to be able to tolerate in my morning smoothie. I do drink this on its on on occasion but usually use it as a base with some ice cubes or frozen fruit because I drink a smoothie made out of frozen fruit every morning and enjoy the cold drink. It contains spirulina, chlorella and blue-green algae all of which would have to be purchased desperately plus if you look at all the fruit in one bottle you really are getting  a bargain...but not for this amazon price. I buy this same 1 gallon container at my local Costco warehouse store for $5.99.<br /><br />So to sum it up great product but buy it at Costco or have it special ordered by your grocery store, most of them will do it if you buy 2-6 at a time.

review/text: But the actual taste is fantastic. I usually don't drink a large amount each time because it leans toward high price size, but it's well worth the money. It contains a balanced nutrients from both fruits and vegetables.<br />I like its taste, but the last bottle I purchases had a slight change of taste, which was a similar taste I disliked from a similar product of another brand. It's fine the taste change slightly because it means the smoothie truly uses fresh vegetables and fruits, which do have changes of tastes from time to time. However, I hope the new taste doesn't last long.

review/text: I LOVE this juice!  I think it's delicious, with a fruity flavor that is great either on its own, or blended with more fruit/ice for a thicker consistency (this product is a bit thin).  Green Machine is naturally sweet, 100% juice, and my family and I love the way it tastes.  It may not be the prettiest smoothie on the block, but don't let that deter you from trying it, because its looks don't affect its flavor!<br /><br />I do agree with the other reviewers who have stated that this price is pretty high compared to where I shop, so making price comparisons may find a less expensive option for you.<br /><br />Highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Ouch! Bilberry @ nearly $28 per item!
review/text: The Bionaturae Bilberry Nectar is a really effective health product, which my friends in an engineering group have proven (to ourselves) to greatly improve night vision, and eye health in general.  Two of the engineers have diabetes and have had inter-ocular bleeding prior to beginning the use of bilberry.  Subsequently, we have had no incidents.  In fact, the Army Air Force used bilberry and carrot juices during WWII to improve pilot's night vision.  That having  been said, the single star is directed at either the ad writing, or the blatant greed evinced by the price.  Nearly $28 plus shipping would be a fair price for a six-pack, but nowhere did I read that the item for which that price was  being asked was, in fact, a six-pack.  Hence, the drop from 5 stars to 1 star.

review/text: Folks, move along--don't buy this from these people.  They are completely incompetent.<br /><br />As an example, here's how they dealt w/my order 2 weeks ago:<br /><br />1 Waited a WEEK, then called me 6 TIMES, harassing me in the middle of a work meeting.<br />2 No one should EVER ship food 2nd day on Wednesdays--most food companies realize this.  If the shipper does make a mistake, the food is sitting in a warehouse somewhere, rotting.  These people actually WAIT A WEEK AND A HALF, then ship on Wednesdays!  Then they try to blame the shippers for their own inccompetence!<br />3. The owner of this company then, after all the fiasco discussed above, send a nasty email, complaining about my rudeness (yeah, why don't we call him 6 times in a row, during some inconvenient time).  He also blamed the shipping being late on FedEx (um, if you shipped on Tuesday or Monday, this doesn't happen)<br />4. Finally, he tried to claim they had upgraded me for shipping on 2nd day air, when the shipping was FREE for orders over 80 dollats.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really bad company.  If you want headaches, then please feel free and order from these people.<br /><br />My advice?  Order from D'Artagnans--I've dealt with them many times and they are considerate, acknowledge mistakes and at least attemt to rectify mistakes, instead of denying any fault at all.<br /><br />One last thing to sum this up--I ordered A WEEK LATER from Thai Food here on Amazon.  The order showed up 5 DAYS BEFORE THIS DID.  But they're not incompetent--not if you talk to them!

review/summary: Very pleased with this hard to find spice blend ~
review/text: The ingredients are listed below (taken from the product package and website):<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Certified USDA Organic<br />Certified Kosher<br />80 gm (2.8 oz) of Spice in a Reusable Tin<br />4 out of 5 Heat (according to their website)<br /><br />Paprika, Black Pepper, Coriander, Nutmeg, Ginger, Ajwain, Allspice, Birdseye Chili, Fenugreek, Cardamom, Clove, Himalayan Pink Salt, Onion, Garlic<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Now I thought about making my own blend, but decided that it would be easier to purchase an already blended amount rather than worrying about the measurements and also sourcing Ajwain (which is similar to caraway).  The blend does seem paprika heavy, but that's okay.  I've tasted it just plain, and it does have a decent heat as well as a paprika/ginger/nutmeg thing going on.  The other spices all add little nuances here and there.  It's not too strong, so just a pinch on your tongue is enough to taste without the spices overwhelming.<br /><br />I've been using this blend for East African dishes (vegan in my case), and I am extremely happy with the results.  I made an Ethiopian Chickpea stew from the "Everyday Happy Herbivore" cookbook and it blew me away.  I did put in 3 1/2 teaspoons (the recipe said to start with 1 and go up to 4).<br /><br />The heat level is pleasant without being explosive.  I would say it's a nice and even burn.  It's not quite as hot as, say, Sambal, but it is surely hotter than most commercial 'hot' salsas.<br /><br />But after researching, I found that there are many variations on this blend, many with extremely rare and local East African spices, others with cumin or cardamon or nutmeg.  The spices that seem to be in common are fenugreek, ginger, black pepper, chili pepper (of some sort), and allspice.  Most had paprika.  So despite my not having had a huge variety of these blends, I cannot vouch for the authenticity, but it seems in line with most variations I have noted.  It seems that the big faux pas is putting turmeric and cumin in the same blend.  Luckily this brand does not.<br /><br />One could make their own blend of these spices, but it's a lot easier to grab a good sized tin from this company, and be happy that it is certified USDA organic.  And tasty too!  And 2.8 oz. is actually a decent amount for $10.  Especially since I couldn't find it locally anywhere, even at Whole Foods.  Great for a little exotic heat in your dishes.

review/text: I bought this pasta because as a diabetic I am interested on lower my glycemic index and I really enjoy eating pasta.  It tastes great- no real difference in flavor from regular pasta- cooks in the same amount of time and the pasta water is great for thickening the sauce.<br /><br /> My only negative comment is the order I received has a few small beetles in it- I froze all the pasta to kill them but still occasionally find one floating in the pasta water that I have to pluck out.  Apparently pasta is a common way for them to enter the house as pasta is never heated when it is made- just dried/cut and boxed.

review/summary: Great Tasting Pasta - Highly Recommended
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)! It is important to test your blood sugar to be sure you react the same way.<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Great pasta, low carbs
review/text: I buy Dreamfields pastas because I am diabetic and have to eat very low carb to control my blood sugar and my weight. Before Dreamfields our choice of dishes was very limited.  Now, with Dreamfields, I can make all those dishes that call for pasta.  Dreamfields lives up to its claim of low carbs because my blood sugar doesn't skyrocket like it does with regular pastas.  It' a bit more expensive than plain pasta, but it's worth it!

review/summary: rip off
review/text: this company uses boxes that leads you to believe you are getting a pound of pasta like other companies but you only get 13 some ounces. I noticed when opening up their boxes how little pasta is inside. I bought a whole bunch of this stuff, different styles that were all in standard size packaging that most companies provide a lb of pasta to realize they mislead you into thinking you are getting a lb.<br />The stuff is not cheap to begin with. I truly wonder with a company that is misleading if their claims of 5 digestable grams of carbs is true. They can say whatever they want as this stuff is not FDA regulated.

review/text: It's a good substitute for cheese sauce.  It's not fake tasting and has real ingredients.  Sure it's good with chips, but I like it on other things- baked potatoes, omlets, broccoli, burritos.  It's a good product for those looking to cut out saturated fat from their diet.

review/summary: very poor acai product
review/text: I tried this several months ago and found it to be an over-priced complete disappointment. I love acai and used to eat the pulps & purees all the time when I lived in Brazil. This is not a good acai product. First, it is stored at room temperature. What a joke. Acai should be maintained frozen to preserve the nutrients..at times refrigeration is okay, but room temp for a fruit product stored for several months...not a good deal. Anyone in Brazil knows this. Second, they claim to use the whole fruit including the seed. This is false marketing. The seeds are used to burn for fuel and composted for fertilizer in Brazil. Nobody uses the seeds for dietary consumption. Finally, this product treats acai as a dietary supplement. Acai is a fruit, a whole food. It is not intended to be served in 1oz serving sizes. Again, you would get laughed at in Brazil if you wanted a 1oz serving of acai. Like asking for 3 blueberries. Don't buy the Genesis Today hype. Very disappointed in all of their products. You're better off looking for some frozen acai pulp or frozen acai puree and eating a normal fruit serving of a few ounces.

review/summary: Relieved my psoriasis symptoms
review/text: My dermatologist diagnosed me with psoriasis several years ago.  I tried prescription and non-prescription treatments, and nothing would completely clear my skin.  At that time, I had the psoriasis on the bottoms of my feet only.  I finally decided to give Mona Vie a try, figuring I had nothing to lose but a few dollars.  Within a few weeks of drinking one to two ounces per day, my skin cleared completely up.  I had heard stories like that, but I didn't really believe the hype, so I was pretty surprised and pleased.  When I stopped drinking Mona Vie, the psoriasis came back.  Mona Vie is very expensive, so I gave it up for a while and just suffered with the skin condition until the patches on my lower leg showed up.  After suffering for several months (while the patches got larger), I finally decided to order some Mona Vie.  I found the Acai100 while searching on Amazon, and I decided to give it a shot since (1) It is pure acai berry (Mona Vie is mixed with other fruits/juices), and (2) It's a bit cheaper.  I've only been drinking this stuff for FOUR DAYS, and the psoriasis is almost completely gone from the bottoms of my feet, and it's about 50 percent cleared up on my lower leg (and the itching is completely gone).  I am completely shocked and couldn't be happier.  I know I sound like a commercial, but I can't help it.  I am really amazed.  As others have said, this stuff tastes terrible, but I just hold my breath and chug an ounce or two.  For me, it is well worth the bad taste.

review/summary: I crave this product now!
review/text: I bought this at the health food store.  My initial thought was "This had better be a great product if they have the nerve to charge forty bucks for a bottle of juice!"  I like the fact that I paid for unadulterated acai, and not for a "blend" that includes a lot of stuff I can get at the grocery store at $3 for 64oz.  If you're paying the premium for acai, be sure you're actually getting acai!<br /><br />On its own this juice is thick and bland, but not offensive.<br /><br />Mixed with some sugar-free lemonade, acai juice is very pleasant and I didn't lose out on any of the wholesome goodness.<br /><br />I drank this when I kicked off my eating-right-exercising-regularly behavior two months ago, and I believe the nutrients in this juice were helpful in giving me energy and getting me off to a great start.<br /><br />I will continue to buy this product, and because of my experience with it I recently bought (from other companies) acai berry air freshener spray and acai berry diffuser reeds and even a cologne that has acai scent in it!  I'd drink this product even if it weren't healthy/therapeutic.

review/summary: No more hunger
review/text: I purchased this product after trying everything to lose weight. I just happen to find an ad for cleansing and Acai berry weight loss things.  So I searched in Amazon for something. I've only had it for two weeks and haven't weighed myself so I can't say how much I've lost.  But I can tell you that I've completely lost my hunger for food.  I'm 90-100lbs overweight.  I love food especially fast food because cooking is not fun for me.  It is not uncommon for me to eat fast food at the very least once a day.  I didn't notice the first two days but day three I was debating what to eat for dinner and realized I couldnt decide which fast food place I wanted to drive though because I wasn't even hungry or craving anything to decide.  Then the next day it happened again, and the next.  Today is Sunday and usually the weekends I just want to eat everything because I have nothing else to do but watch tv and eat out of boredom or for flavor.  I now actually have to tell myself to eat. Believe me, I LOVE food.  I eat for flavor.  Now suddenly I don't even care to eat.  Maybe its mental but I've never not been hungry.  So after going nearly all day without wanting to eat.  Crazy, I know, I finaly made up my mind to go get a chicken sandwich from BK.  I made it half way and actualy put the other half down.  Never in my life have I stopped eating at the first sign of fullness.  Thats just a small part of my weight issues.  I have to clean the plate. Thats when I knew I had to write a review.  I drank it plain and its not that bad.  But I suggest drinking it with orange juice.  I don't even notice it.  It doesn't change the flavor at all.  Just the color of the orange juice changes a bit.  I still can't believe I didnt eat the whole dang sandwhich.  As for will it help lose weight?  I guess if it surpresses appetite, you eat less, therefore less calorie consumption.  And if you excercise thats just more bonus.  We'll see.

review/text: This stuff is supposed to be great for many things, energy, losing weight, gaining muscle, helps to sleep, etc...  And it does work, but the taste is awful.  You can't taste it when you mix it in with some things, but drinking it straight is not recommended.  I love the effect this stuff has on my body, but my taste buds will not allow me to drink it anymore.  I recommend this mostly to people who can mix it in with protein drinks, maybe certain coffee's, or whatever that has a strong flavor that can cancel the "flavor" of this stuff.  I don't drink a wide variety of liquids so I could only mix it with one or two things.

review/text: Since using acai supplements the cramps and tightness in my knee and palm disappeared. I started with some other acai juice product at the beginning but nothing could compare to Acai100 100% Acai Berry Jice Pulp Supplement. Soon after start I felt unbelievable changes in my muscle tone. Doctor told me I would never run again, but after one month I was back running with no pain at all. My palm was so tight with ligaments almost closing my fist completely, and that bared me from gym for a long while. I do push ups again. This product is just perfect: tasty and powerful.<br />It arrived well protected and packed in only two days.

review/summary: Amazing Results! Love it!
review/text: I really loved the results that this gave me. The Acai Berry100 juice by Genesis is extremely thick, not watered down at all. It is not your typical tasting juice though. It is not sugared up or watered down, it is the real deal. So the taste is somewhat unigue, a bit getting use to I guess, but the results are amazing! The thickness is exactly what people are looking for. You can tell it is what they claim it is. I've seen other Acai Berry liguids claiming that they are 100% Acai Berry, but the liguid is so watery & watered down. I took this product along with Green Kamut & I got some awesome results, lost several lbs. I enjoy taking it with cold apple juice. I continue to take it & absolutely love it! Would definitely recommend to others.

review/text: I really like Acai 100 juice. It really does make me feel more energized and gives me an overall good feeling. I actually do not mind the taste either, I mix it w/ grape juice or really any other juice that was in the fridge. I do think it is pricey though so I am currently debating if I will place another order. I ordered it because I wanted to see if it would help with weight loss and curb my appetite which it did not at all. However, it did give me increased energy so I was able to go a little longer on walks and exercising which did help me lose a few pounds. If price is not an issue, I would recommend using Acai 100.

review/text: I was skeptical at first because a few of my friends were really pushing me towards Monavie, but I could not afford $140.00 a month (or cheaper if I could get people to sign up under me).  Monavie will not state how much of the acai berry is in each bottle, so I decided to find an alternative.  This was the best I could find, and affordable as well.  Didn't see results the first couple of weeks, talked to a sales associate who suggested to increase the dose to 2 oz. per serving (I mix with V8).  That made a very noticable improvement in how I felt and was just starting to see a difference in curbing my appetite, then I ran out.  At my local health food store, found the same product for about the same price.

Confirmed by my husband and friends. I am down 5 lbs but I can't say at this point if this is due to using this product. I can say that when I started the product my energy level was a lot higher the first week and has leveled out a bit since. I stopped taking the product later in the day because of this. Overall I am very pleased. I may try the freeze dried version next time to compare results but I like the idea of taking the berry in as purest form as possible. The product I received was a thick pulpy juice, tasted fine with a little grape juice added to sweeten.

review/summary: Top notch service - Super product
review/text: I first contacted this company by email prior to placing an order and was astounded to receive a full and friendly reply within minutes. I still had one question which I had forgotten to ask so sent another email. I mentioned that I might not see the response for a while as had to take my dog to the vet as she was an elderly dog and was sick. When I returned from vet not only had my question been answered, but also found a nice note showing concern for my pet. I placed an order a few days later and was quite impressed that the Acai arrived ahead of schedule and was packed perfectly ... these are glass bottles so that's an important point. The product itself is actually quite tasty and seems to really work as described. My wife has showed a marked improvement in her circulation and energy level. Its hard to describe what it does exactly, but I feel much better since I started my "start the morning" ounce routine.<br /><br />Bottom line: Naturally Vibrant Health is a company you can trust to give you a good customer service experience in a businesslike and caring, personal manner. I would not hesitate to do business with them again. In fact, we will become regular repeat customers. Oh, Meisje, (the dog, a 14 year old vizsla) is doing much better ... thanks for asking!<br /><br />Harold (Roanoke, VA)

review/summary: The Best Acai Product
review/text: This is the very first Acai product I used and continue to use today. Although sometimes I used Amazon Thunder. After a very extensive research on the many products available in the market I narrowed it down to Genesis Today. This is a very pure, thick mascerated pulp.No added sugar nor water. Not the best tasting acai product, but since you drink 1 to 3 ounces at a time is not bad ( use a shot glass ). I started drinking Acai for the anti-inflammatory properties and it works wonderful. It took away the huge pain I had in my hip area that I could barely get up in the morning. Tip: if the taste bothers you too much, mix it in a glass with organic grape juice.

review/text: This Acai liquid form is what you want if you want to lose a pound or two each week & look much better in your clothes. Give up any pill type of Acai - this is what you want. You'll save a lot of Money in the long run & get results closer to what you've heard about. I've tried various Acai products for 5 months now - they don't hold a candle to this one. Personally you'll notice the weight loss more on your body than you will see on the scales. It really gets that gut fat - All my friends & family noticed & complimented on how much healthier I looked. And, I hate to argue with them. So in short - Acai works very slightly in pill form & really works in liquid - three capfulls in a glass of calorie free juice twice a day. You'll see results you're happy with.

review/summary: Gives me energy
review/text: I am only 39 and I have had a problem with my energy levels for the past few years.  They thought I had Lupas, blood disorders, etc.  Anyways, I started taking this and a liver cleanse at the same time and I now have energy to clean, exercise, play with the kids, quilt, etc.  I used to sleep for 10 hours and still feel horrible.  After starting this, I can sleep for 7 hours and feel ready to go.  I have no idea how it works, but I love it.  This purchase was actually for my mother but she just started taking it so I don't know if it is having the same effect on her.

review/summary: Not the real stuff!
review/text: If this was pure, 100% Acai it would have to be refrigerated or frozen. If it is not it means the vial fats which contain most of the good nutrients of Acai, like the Omegas have been taken out. Because of the healthy fat PURE Acai goes rancid rapidly if not refrigerated. The only true Acai I have found is a brand called Sambazon. They are also the leading provider of Acai in the nation and you don't pay these ridiculous prices either.

review/summary: First time
review/text: This is the first time I have tried this product, am not sure if it has improved my health as of yet. The taste is alright, it is better mixed with fruit juice, otherwise bitter tasting on it's own. I will continue to use this product in hopes that it will improve my overall health.

review/summary: Convenient to use and tastes great!
review/text: Since we drink a lot of coffee I decided to try this product. I use a bit of cream and sugar or Splenda in my coffee, while my wife uses cream only. She didn't mind that there was some sweetness in this product.<br /><br />PROs:<br />-- Easy to use<br />-- Tastes great and much better than powdered creamer (even Coffe-Mate)<br />-- Just enough sweetness to make my coffee taste good.<br /><br />CONs:<br />-- Container size is too large for casual coffee drinkers<br />-- Pump tends to clog after 1/2 to 2/3rds of a container<br />-- One-way screw top for pump keeps you from rinsing or cleaning clogs<br /><br />I read most of the reviews here before buying this product. Because of info in the reviews, prior to starting use I modified the container top so I could take the pump off, if necessary for cleaning. As it turns out, about half way through the container, the pump started clogging. After cleaning with hot water, the pump worked all the way through to the end of the bottle.<br /><br />I would be more likely to purchase this product regularly if it was available in a smaller size, or if the pump could be removed for cleaning out clogs.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this product and will probably buy it again in the future.

review/summary: Product great but pump clogs..... hard to free product
review/text: I like this creamer a lot. Tastes good, and it's good for speeding things up a tiny bit in the morning. However, if you don't use this thing a lot (at least I think that's the issue) then it clogs up and it's nigh impossible to get the creamer out. Bummer! I don't think I'll buy this again, just for that reason alone. Though, I guess I could buy it and just place it in a container of my own to prevent the issue.....

review/summary: Taste is ok, pump design is not that great
review/text: I've tried both Coffee-Mate creamer pumps in both Hazelnut and French Vanilla varieties as well as the original. We use them for convenience at our office as well as at my church. The creamer itself is approximately equivalent to what you get in the individual flavored cups you find at gas stations and some restaurants. It's nowhere near as good as the fresh stuff you get at your grocery store. Each pump is supposed to be equal to one mini-tub but I don't think it is quite as potent personally.<br /><br />The main issue with these pumps aside from a compromise on taste is the poor quality of the pumps themselves. They frequently fail while the canister still has several inches of creamer still in it. Because of the nature of condensed creamer (thick and sticky) using the last 15-20% of the tub becomes tedious and messy. You either have to waste some of the creamer or sacrifice the convenience of of the pump--which is the main selling point to begin with.<br /><br />We still use these pumps because there is no readily available alternative, but for my personal coffee I stay away from them and go for fresh creamer whenever possible.

review/summary: Good product but cost is too high!
review/text: Last time I bought this product it was 2/10 at the cost of $24.72 from Amazon but now in May 2010 the price is $30.77? Why such a big price increase? Now Amazon is more expensive then most other retailers? This is weird as Amazon usually has the lowest prices? Sams Club the cost is $9.88 each so 2 would be $19.76. Come on Amazon, for such a popular product on Amazon....lower the price and make sure you have plenty of stock on hand!<br />By the way....the product is great but the pump tends to clog so don't tighten the cap too tight so you can later remove it and rinse it with hot water to remove the clog.
