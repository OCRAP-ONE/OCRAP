review/summary: Bold Flavour!!
review/text: I had my eyes on this product for more than 2 years, but always found it too expensive. Now the price went down, and I took advantage and bought it. I am so glad I did, because it really is great!<br /><br />Very bold basil flavour, great for salads or over cooked food. I don't fry or cook with it, as I am afraid to lose the flavour or harm the delicate oil somehow.<br /><br />I fry and cook with regular (unflavoured) olive oil (extra vergine ONLY, nothing else is real!), and when I want a basil flavour with it, I am sprinkeling this oil over the finished dish. Wonderful effect!<br /><br />Pasta and rice dishes are enhanced in a great way, and you don't need much of it to have this effect. I will absolutely buy this again!<br /><br />The bottles are plastic and sealed inside under the bottle lid, so don't worry about the shipping! There will be no mess! The bottles cannot be broken, and there won't be anything leaking!

review/summary: A Step Up From Science Diet
review/text: My vet had always recommended Science Diet, and I'd been feeding my cat Science Diet Light for years, but he never lost weight.  My cat wasn't obese, but he was between 13-15 lbs when he should have been 11-12.  No amount of cutting down on servings seemed to have an effect, either.<br /><br />I switched to using Royal Canin Light about 3 months ago, and I've already noticed a huge difference.  My cat's weight is down to the target range of 11-12 lbs, but more importantly, he's got a lot more energy.  Where he used to sort of mope around the apartment lethargically, he now runs around like a kitten (which he's not!).  He's had an enormous increase in energy in all day parts and his general temperament seems to have improved.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product, especially to people struggling to control their pet's weight.

They sorted the food and ate all the Royal Canin pieces first, leaving behind the other brand.<br />I'm so happy they liked it. But mostly I'm happy they are eating high protein food instead of fillers. It's expensive, yes, but I think it's worth it.<br />I do recommend this product.

She's dropped 0.3 of a pound in a little over two weeks. Which is cool 'cause she likes to leap from her condo onto my lap. And the Vet says she likes this food.

review/summary: We broke the 18 lb mark
review/text: on our resident fat cat, Simon.  Since last year we have been working to lower Simon's weight by lowering his calorie content. He has gone from 19 lbs 2 oz a year ago to 17 lb 14 ounces. I did the research and found that this formula is among the lowest in Kcal per cup.  Simon and his housemates had no difficulty with adjusting to this food.  When I put the empty bag on the floor last night, Simon crawled into the bag and licked the sides. Yeah its that good.  The morsels are a good size and allow even my petite female and my boy who is missing some teeth, the ability to easily eat it. Our other kitties also have slimmed down a bit too.  The only reason that I did not give it five stars is not the quality but the price, which is on the high side even when compared to other "diet" cat foods.

review/summary: Best Dry Catfood Around For Sensitive Tummys!
review/text: I have tried all of the better dry cat foods for hair balls, including several obtainable only by a vet's perscription, and this is the very best one out there.  It has greatly reduced the general odor of my cats' poops as well as their tendancy to leave watery messes right outside their box (they do know how to make a statement!)and the up-chuck of hairballs themselves is very rare and minor.  To be fair, it is true that I have increased their brushings from....never...to several times a week.  I discovered that even short hair cats can shed like crazy, and that has also helped a lot.<br /><br />The cats seem to find this food very palatable and chomp it down with gusto!<br /><br />I would highly recommend the entire Royal Canin line, particularly after my local pet shop owner said that it was one of the few which were not involved in the crisis in which many cats died several years ago from ingrediants in several of the leading cat foods.

review/text: I would have started writing this review by joking that "it's our little secret," if it weren't for the the millions of British tea drinkers addicted to Ahmad's... I love this tea and drink it all the time. Often I brew a mixed pot with the Ahmad Early Grey and another type of tea, like Ahmad No. 1 Breakfast (also very good) or just a Lipton Black Tea bag. It also works great when used alongside any Turkish black tea. This triple pack of 100 bags that Amazon sells is the most economical way of buying this tea, especially when you sign up for the subscription and get a 15% discount with free shipping on your order. Normally, you'll pay 8.50 or more for a 100-bag if you find it in an imported goods store; this 3-pack is like buying two and getting one free.

review/summary: Good soup!
review/text: I bought this on sale 40% off clearance price.  It came out to about $0.62 per cup.  Nice price!  I like the taste.  It's like mild-medium spiced.  It vaguely reminded me of spicy bean soup.  The couscous definitely has flavor (as opposed to most couscous I've tried).  Someone with a light appetite could eat this as a meal.  I believe it is vegetarian.  I think it's a great value for good tasting food, and I would definitely eat this often.<br /><br />It's basically like a healthier "cup-o-noodles" because you just add hot water, wait, and eat it.  If you care about the nutritional value, read on.  It's only 200 calories, low in fat, no saturated fat, has carbs for energy, has fiber (4g, which is 14%DV), has a decent amount of protein from the couscous and lentils, which by themselves are low in protein, but together they fill out each other's gaps in essential amino acids (10g, I believe you need about 50g in a day)), and has iron (15%DV).  The only downside might be the sodium.  It has 730mg (30%DV) of sodium, but isn't too bad if you're eating it as a meal or if the rest of your day's food is lower in sodium.<br /><br />Calories: 200<br />Calories from Fat: 15<br />Total Fat: 1.5g (2% DV)<br />Sat Fat: 0g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium 730mg (30% DV)<br />Total Carb: 36g (12% DV)<br />Dietary Fiber: 4g (14% DV)<br />Sugars: 5g<br />Protein: 10g<br />Vit A: 0%<br />Vit C: 2%<br />Calcium: 4%<br />Iron: 15%<br /><br />Percent Daily Values (DV) based on 2,000 calorie diet)

review/text: These little cups of couscous are superb snacks. The curry is not spicy enough to throw you off, and the lentils are a great choice. The taste of the couscous is just right: a hint of curry, and the nutty smoothness of lentils.  The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because of the 12 cups, three contained a mix that seemed to have gotten moist somehow. All the others contained a very loose, dry couscous mix.<br /><br />These are great to take with you for lunch (as long as you can get your hands on some boiling water).  I'd maybe take a chicken breast or a cup of other veggies to toss with the couscous so that it becomes more of a meal, but as a snack? Great!

review/text: If you are looking for the perfect light lunch or snack on a cold day when only soup will do, Nile Spice Lentil Curry Couscous is just the thing. It's thicker than the usual "cuppa-soup" products in the supermarket, and the taste is far richer and more flavorful than you'd get from that overload of salt and artificial ingredients.<br /><br />The spice is not overwhelming, it's just a touch more than mild. The prep time is a little more than "instant." After pouring in the boiling water, be sure to wait a minimum of five minutes before eating -- I'd even recommend ten. Any sooner and the soup will not develop the right consistency, which is wonderfully rich. Keep a stash of these at work, so you'll never be without a satisfying lunch. This is an excellent product!

review/summary: Wow! Better than anticipated!
review/text: I am always skeptical trying new things. Even on Amazon and a well rated product, part of me just wonders if I am wasting money taking the chance on not liking an item.<br /><br />This Soup was outstanding. It has some spice, but not overpowering. The couscous is not pearled and chunky, nor is it overly sweet. The lentils are nice and mushy when cooked. I find one cup to be a little stingy (or I like this soup a lot) so I usually eat 2 in one sitting for lunch to up my fiber and keep my appetite at bay till dinner. They are a bit high on sodium, but if you are like me and don't eat too much sodium to begin with this should not be a big issue.<br /><br />One cup is 200 calories with only 15 from fat. The meals is light on sugar with only 5 grams and a decent 4 grams in dietary fiber, 10 of protein. So I think all in all this is a pretty decent quick meal for those who want to stay away from fast food or the vending machine. I've eaten Near East couscous and actually prefer the spices in Nile Spice Couscous to the kind of bland flavor of Near East. (though I do love Near East as well)<br /><br />Highly recommend - perfect for busy moms, people working long hours or those who just want a simple healthy snack. After I eat these for lunch I am good for at least 6 hours before my next meal. With three kids running around, it is a blessing!

I have found with these kind of products that they taste much better if you let them sit a few more minutes after adding the water then they recomend before eating them. That helps to hydrate all of the bits and pieces and it tastes much better that way. You can always reheat in the microwave. I would recomend this product to my friends.<br /><br />Dean

review/summary: Delicious and easily-modifiable lunch!
review/text: I have yet to try a Nile Spice product I don't like, but this is one of my favorites.  I keep a selection of these in my desk at work as "emergency stock" in case I don't have time to get out and eat.  Hot water from an office water cooler/heater is hot enough to properly prepare this soup, if one does not have any other means of heating water at work. I also routinely bring these products as part of a planned lunch.  The Couscous Lentil Curry is delicious and flavorful - not at all bland as others have said.  It's NOT a hot curry... but as someone who likes hot curries, I can say that I also like this one.  As another reviewer said, someone with a light appetite could eat just this as a satisfying lunch.  I prefer to bring a piece of bread or a roll to accompany it.  I also often add frozen vegetables (peas work particularly well) to it just before or after adding the hot water.  The vegetables heat up and add an extra flavor/texture, as well as some additional nutrients.<br /><br />I have found that all of the Nile Spice soups can be modified easily - with the addition of vegetables, grated cheese, rice, cooked meat, etc.. They form a very easy and flavorful base for other meals.<br /><br />One issue - someone else mentioned that these don't have all the salt of other cup o' soups.  That's not true.  Unfortunately they do contain a relatively large percentage of one's daily value for sodium - this one is 30%.  And, the American Heart Association believes that the current daily value for adults should be slashed in half... which means this contains 60% of the "unofficial" recommended daily value of sodium.  Still, if you're not on a salt-restricted diet, and you carefully read nutrition labels and limit your intake of processed food (the main culprit in sodium consumption) you should end up okay for the day.  This soup is usually my only highly-processed food for the day.  People DO need sodium in order to live... it's just that they need only a fraction of what the average person consumes daily.

review/text: This soup is good, easy to prepare, stores well, and has healthy ingredients. To me, Couscous seems to be like a rice version of Grits ;-) It goes well with a sandwich or other part of a meal. The price was very good also, at less than $1 for each cup. I enjoy it. I hope this review is helpful.

review/summary: For a "cup-o-couscous" it's fantastic!
review/text: This product if very tasty without adding all the junk traditional "cup" meals add, which is why I decided to give it a try.  The main thing to notice is that it is all natural, it comes in a paper/cardboard cup (safer), not a foam cup (which can leak dioxins).  This is a product of great quality, which is why I decided to also order the rice and Red Bean soup from them.  It's a great fast lunch for those busy work days.  The only thing I may warn consumers of is the sodium level, which is much better than most of these ready-meals, but it's still about 25% of the daily allowance.  Get it with the subscribe and save and get it even cheaper!

review/summary: A Delicious Soup with a Hint of Spice
review/text: If you're ever in the need for an exotic alternative, in your regular soup routine, then try Nile Spice soups. Nile Spice Lentil Curry Couscous soup is a light blend of curry, turmeric, and other East / West Indian spices. Although the soup lacks the punch of spiciness one would expect from a true Indian (or Caribbean) curry dish, the soup is still a delicious meal.<br /><br />As a person who is allergic to monosodium glumate (MSG), I am glad to have found a brand of instant soup meals that does not contain this harmful food additive. The soup does have a slightly high sodium content percentage at 30%; however, most processed items containing sodium are within the same percentile.<br /><br />Try the Nile Spice Lentil Curry Couscous soup today and be whisked away into a unique aroma from half way around the world.

review/text: Couscous is a kind of tiny pasta. This is a very satisfying quick lunch. I wouldn't call this soup but its similar to a very thick soup. I'm not a big curry lover but I like this. The label recommends against microwaving. The coffemaker at my work has a hot water spigot and the hot water from the spring water dispenser is also hot enough. Like someone else said, the label states to let it stand for 5 minutes after adding the boiling water but 10 minutes is probably better. Enjoy!

review/text: This is a really nice lunch option. It's hearty, tasty, easy, and as my wife says 'feels like a comfort food.' The curry flavor is good, but it isn't really spicy, so if you like some heat in your curry, this will be a disappointment. I've taken to adding some ground chili powder to the mix to add some hotness and that's helped a lot. Not very convenient to take chili powder to work with you though.

review/text: This couscous is quick to make (just boil some water, pour it in, wait 5 mins) and the couscous consistency and taste is alright for such a quickly prepared dish.  My trouble was with the little corn and misc dried vegetables at the top of the couscous.  They just never seemed to moisten properly, and always wound up tasting dry and unappetizing.  You can eat around them, of course, but I'd rather not have to.

I wish Happy Baby would come up with a yogurt snack with no or very little sugar, I would buy it than.

review/text: These are the first snacks and finger foods I ever gave to my daughter. I was so scared of her choking on anything that I thought I would wait till she's 1 or longer... and then I came across HappyMelts Yogurt Melts and I totally felt in love with them. They melt in her mouth quickly and they are delicious. I've tried all 3 of them: Mixed Berry, Strawberry and Banana and I have to tell you they are all different.<br />Mixed Berry - purple, very flat oval shaped, very easy and quick melts, very sweet<br />Strawberry - pink, very hard acorn shaped (like little Hershey kisses), chunkier and melts not as quick, not as sweet<br />Banana- yellow, softer acorn shaped (like little Hershey kisses), chunky but they melt quickly<br />I thought there was something wrong with all strawberry ones, as they seem to be really hard, but I guess that's the way they are. Mixed Berry is my baby's favorite and I love them too :)

My eight month old son immensely enjoyed them, and I looked at the ingredients and was really surprised to find sugar listed second, right after the cultured milk. It is organic sugar yes, but still added sugar- and I'm bummed as this was not something that I wanted to introduce to his diet yet. My fault that I was swayed by advertising, and didn't read the back.

review/summary: Prebiotics and Probiotics!!!
review/text: I have 2 boys, 5 and 8 and they love Happy Melts! They have been on a kick with Banana Mango but love all the flavors. My 5 year old was asked to bring the snack to school last week and we brought these to share. All 13 of the kids in the class loved them and asked for seconds. My 8 year old is an extremely picky eater and he loves these as well.<br />  My favorite thing about them is that they contain probiotics (helps maintain a healthy balance of good bacteria in the intestines and boost your immune system) and prebiotics (which keeps the good bacteria healthy). I have checked other brands and Happy Melts is the only product to have both of these. I also love that it comes in BPA packaging and does not contain anything artificial. I wish I could give this product 10 stars!!!

Baby ate the Gerber ones okay...but I tried one and almost spit it out.  It tasted like cardboard. These ones actually taste like strawberry yogurt.  You can't go wrong!

She also likes the berry flavors - I think they're pretty tasty too but all the other adults who've taste-tested found them foul.  Oh well.

Not a lot for the price, but this is the same buying elsewhere.<br /><br />Overall the cons aren't really cons, just wanted to make sure parents that haven't tried these were aware.  Buy these regularly, so not really negatives.

review/summary: Toddler loves them, but they are gone too soon for the cost
review/text: My son loves these things, but they go too fast. He pretty much eats half a bag at a time - and that ends up being quite expensive. I stopped buying them because of this. However, I would definitely consider getting them again for a roadtrip because they are dry, portable, and not messy even if dropped on the floor or seat. But for snacks at home, they are not worth the money.

review/summary: A Little Scary How Much The Kid Loves These
review/text: I am a first time mom, and our child had A LOT Of difficulties with solid foods and had an overactive gag reflex.  This food (and we do buy these in the set of 8)was and continues to be a lifesaver.  When nothing else would do, our baby LOVED these. I will say that they are on the expensive side compared to what you can get in the grocery stores and "big-baby-chain" stores.  We compared these to the GERBER yougurt melts and I believe there to be a noticible difference in quality/ taste, with these coming out on top. In the begining when she was just starting solids she would eat bunches of these on her own. They melt very quickly and for us, there was never a concern for choking (or puking with the overactive gag reflex).  Our baby is older now and can eat a lot more table foods, but we still mix these in with other puffs, cherrios, and small cereals for her to eat as a mix.<br /><br />I have purchased three orders of these from amazon (and enjoy amazon prime shipping)- so will likely purchase again, would recommend to a friend, and would buy (in smaller portions) as a gift for other moms to try out.

I don't think he has much of a sweet tooth and prefers the mild tart flavor of these.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is the price.  SIGH

review/text: My daughter loves these yogurt melts.  She's been eating them since she was nine months old and is now 18 months old and still enjoys them as a snack.  For me, the sugar content is still a bit high so I try to limit the amount I give her.  These are great, no mess snacks when on the go, at the playground or at the beach.  I have to put a small amount in a separate container in my diaper bag because my daughter recognizes the packaging and would really like to eat the whole bag.

review/summary: Great Snack For Babies & Toddlers!
review/text: We have been buying these melts for about 7-8 months now for our daughter. They do tend to go fast, and since they are pricey we buy them sparingly and give them to her as a special treat. No funky ingredients in these that you cannot pronounce. I love how you know exactly what you are giving your child with these (and bonus, NO artificial colors/dyes!). I definitely recommend them as an addition to your diaper bag essentials. They keep my daughter busy when she is getting antsy while out running errands. Overall a great snack to have on hand for your little one(s)!

review/summary: My son's favorite snack!
review/text: These are my 2-year-old son's favorite snacks of all time. Having tasted them myself, I can see why! I like to make a toddler "trail mix" with them, using pretzels, puffs, etc; but he typically picks the yogurt melts out of the mix, eats them, and then asks for more melts, ignoring the other stuff. It's nice to have a snack option that offers the nutrition of yogurt without having the mess of regular yogurt, or the need for refrigeration. We don't do a ton of dairy in our household, so I like that, in addition to being delicious, this snack is a good calcium source.<br /><br />These are nice for younger babies too because, as the name implies, they melt in the mouth. I know there are other companies out there that make yogurt snacks, but I like that these are 100% organic, preservative-free, and have pre- and probiotics. Highly recommend.

They melt in your mouth.  I've had nieces and nephews that love to snack on these too whenever they come to our house.  They range from 3 to 8 years old.  I like how it's just organic yogurt, and how they're perfect for little fingers.  I only wished that they'd sell these in a variety pack for all the flavors.

review/text: My 2 young toddlers loved the Gerber yogurt melts, but it was getting too expensive to buy so many packs every week. I ended up trying these Happymelts, and thank goodness my daughters liked these too.  Personally when I tried them, I preferred the Gerber better as these were a little chalky, but since these are organic and cheaper on Amazon, I went this route. Love that this is yogurt that doesn't make a mess, doesn't require refrigeration, and is easy to transport. The girls love this when we're out and needing a snack.

review/summary: I don't even have a baby!
review/text: I really like these. They melt in your mouth like astronaut ice cream and bring back fond memories of my childhood. Plus they're all organic and the entire bag only has 120 calories so you don't have to feel too bad about eating them all. The strawberry is definitely the best flavor. I've had the other two and they're okay but I don't think they're worth the high price.<br />I know Gerber makes their own version of these that I have seen at Safeway for only $3 each but I think they aren't organic. The only reason I would buy the Gerber ones is that they have strawberry, wildberry and peach flavors instead of strawberry, wildberry, and some sort of banana mango flavor. I don't remember exactly what the yellow flavor is...only that I disliked it.<br />AMMENDMENT TO REVIEW: The Gerber version is nowhere near as tasty as these ones. They are larger and chalkier and taste more artificial. If you are going to buy them online anyway, go for the good stuff.

review/summary: poor packaging and customer service
review/text: We purchased this product and the ziplock seals did not function, so there was no way to reseal the package after opening.  We tried to contact every single email address on their website and nobody at that company thought it was important enough to respond.  There are lots of organic baby products out there, and we will purchase from other companies and hope others will do the same.
