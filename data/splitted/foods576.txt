review/summary: Taste Like Acid
review/text: Should really give this product a below zero review, but there's no choice about that. The first bite is okay, but after eating the whole sandwhich, I realized that my stomach wants to turn upside down, and the after taste is so terrible that I wanted to puke all the food I've eaten. It taste so yukky and horrible that it would not go away for awhile even though I gargle and drink lots of liquid. I wonder if there's a food poisoning in here. Will never ever buy this canned food again!!!

review/summary: Great chips
review/text: Hi:<br /><br />I bought a 24 pack of these 2 ounce bags (size you would get at Quiznos or Subway with a sandwich) since they were less than I could get them at Costco in a equal pack of Frito chips. I had tried previously by buying a bag at my local Albertsons and they are good. Good chip for dipping sicne they're a little thicker than Lays. The chips are fresh, crisp and great tasting; perfect for putting a bag lunch for work or school.<br /><br />NOTE: Bags are made extra thick paper with a plastic lining for freshness and very difficult to open by hand. Use a knife or scissors.

review/text: You just can't beat Kettle Chips.  No other brand comes close to these.  If you like pepper, these are for you.  This company also makes other flavors that are just as good.  And it's not just the flavors that makes this brand stand out.  It's the way they're cooked and the actual flavor of the potato that you'll love!

review/summary: Ranch isn't only good with tortilla chips....
review/text: I have been a longtime fan of Kettle Potato Chips, since I was a small child. The terrific texture and "crunch" of their product never leaves me disappointed - what's more, the high quality ingredients that go into the top-of-the-line flavors they have are first rate. Zesty Ranch does not fail to disappoint me. The Ranch flavor has a terrific, zippy quality (like the flavor name would suggest). It livens up your taste buds, and I am pleased to say that it isn't too salty, nor too greasy. Each chip is packed to it peak with flavor, and it is far from skimped upon. You almost don't need any dip or sauce of any kind on this snack. It speaks for itself. Highly recommended. Makes me want to go crunch on some right now!

review/summary: Most of the Bags were open
review/text: I've eaten these Krinkle Cut Salt and Pepper Chips for years.  I was very excited to find them on Amazon.  I bought the 24 pack specifically so they would be fresh every time I opened them (opposed to buying an 8 or 12 oz larger bag).<br /><br />When I went to get a bag this evening, I noticed they were slightly open and the chips were stale.  I checked the rest of the bags in the box and most of them were open.  I think it may have to do with the oil on the chips.  They seeped into the seal and loosened the glue.<br /><br />I called into Amazon Customer Service and the CSR was pretty rude.  The first question she asked was why I didn't report this earlier.  Duh, maybe because I didn't notice the problem until now?  I've been very happy with Amazon's Customer Service in the past and have been buying 100s of dollars product during this Christmas season.  Hopefully this was just a cranky CSR and not indicative of Amazon's direction for customer service.

review/summary: Yummy chips!
review/text: My son and I agree. These are fine flavored potato chips! The Kettle brand has a lot of interesting variations on flavoring. This is one of those we like best from their stable of goodies.<br /><br />I went to graduate school in Buffalo, lived in Western New York for years, and frequented the Anchor Bar, where chicken wings were invented. So I rather like the cheekiness of referring to Buffalo wings in this product!<br /><br />And these are tasty indeed. I would prefer a bit more of the bite/heat of a Buffalo chicken wing, but that is not a serious issue. I find it amazing that this product can even hint at the pleasures of Buffalo chicken wings!

They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know. They are much more flavorful. Never had this flavor before. before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!<br /><br />These arrived in a case of individually wrapped chips. Each one was in great shape. No open or broken bags. No mess, no crumbs.<br /><br />If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: What I like about them:<br />1) Krinkle makes very thick chips, what's even better is that the krinkle cut chips feel even thicker because they are krinkled or have ridges in them.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing. I like the peppery flavor of these.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

These are the absolutely best chips I have ever eaten.  The funny thing is that the bleu's were the ones that I thought I would probably regret getting.  They are awesome.  I will buy again.  And again.  And again.<br /><br />I would suggest, though, if you get them to get the smallest bag size or else you will do what my family and I have done:  finish a bag every other day.  The smallest bag might be the most expensive per ounce but they will probably last longer.

review/summary: Always delicious and always expensive
review/text: Kettle chips are always delicious,though a little expensive considering they're just potatoes.  WAY better than anything Frito-Lays puts out.  It's a shame that the independent chip companies are dying out at the local grocers because Frito-Lays crowds them out, when the independents are so much better.  Take a trip to your local Trader Joe's or Amazon to find good chips nowadays, and cheap too if you find them on sale here, cheap all the time at Trader Joe's.

review/summary: A very tasty chip!
review/text: These chips are crisp, tangy and a nice change from barbecue flavor chips.  If you like spicy foods, you'll love these.  The blue cheese is not at all overwhelming, just adds that extra "bite."  The box of chips arrived well packed, nothing broken, and the expiration date was over 3 months in advance, making this a very good value, considering the 20% discount Amazon had during November.

review/summary: OK but not great
review/text: First off the krinkle cut chips are far inferior to the regular style kettle chips in my opinion.  Secondly, the flavor doesn't really capture the taste of buffalo wings or bleu cheese.  They taste kinda weird.  It's probably not the best type of flavor to put on a potato chip, even though I love wings.

As a result, Buffalo Bleu was on my list.<br /><br />I was in for a real surprise when I got my hands on this flavor.  It has a great taste -- not too sweet, not too salty -- and a nice crunch.  There's not really anything else to say; if you like good chips, give these a try.

review/summary: One of the healthier chips
review/text: Simple, uncomplicated and healthy ingredients. Cooked in expeller pressed oils (not heated to extract, which causes loss of nutritional value), Kettle chips have a firmer texture than most others, but they have great flavor, even though no flavor enhancers are used except for the spices. No preservatives is also a plus. My only negative experience with them is an occasional bag in which the chips in the very bottom of the bag are oily. I was so pleased to find them at a price nearly a third less than what I have been paying in the grocery market.

review/text: This flavor of Kettle chips is my favorite.  I always need to have a few of these bags laying around for a good movie or sporting event.  Krinkle cut happens to be my favorite type of chip and kettle chip delivers on these.  Not only are the chips always crispy and fresh, but they have a perfect coating of salt and pepper.<br /><br />That coating creates a nice blend of salt w/ a bit of nice black pepper kick that lets you know the chip is willing to give a bit of bite before surrendering.  I've gotten a few boxes of these over the past year and have had no problems with the chips or unbalanced flavoring.  Once again Kettle delivers a fantastic product that delights the taste buds

review/summary: Stale, too oily to touch and tasted weird
review/text: I ve had this exact kind a ton of times at my local deli and love their taste, figured i d save a bunch by getting a box of 24 delivered to my desk at work. Unfortunately, I think they unloaded their oldest/worst batch on me. The chips tasted stale, leached out a ton of oil ( I m not kidding, felt like I was eating pizza given how much oil i was leaching out with a napkin from each individual chip!) and the taste was just off. I think with all the oil that leached out, it upset the flavor balance of the chip and now they just taste really salty and stale.<br /><br />Tried 3 different bags, and it was the same in each case (couldnt eat more than a couple of chips, they were that bad). Got in touch with Amazon customer care, and they were kind enough to get me a refund, but i recommend that you save yourself the hassle and give these a miss.

review/text: I bought 2 cases of these chips because I heard nothing but great things about this brand and this flavor of chip in particular. However, upon receiving them today, I saw that although they state NO MSG, they DO contain Yeast Extract which acts exactly as MSG does and therefore I cannot eat them. Unfortunately ALL Kettle chips contain this ingredient so I am unable to eat any of them. I don't think I can return them but I got them at a cheap price so I will donate them or see if Amazon can let me return them since the description was a bit misleading. These chips are MUCH healthier than many other brands, so if you are not MSG sensitive, I say dig in!

review/text: The fact that Kettle Foods claims their products are "All Natural" really, really, really upsets me. These chips, and many other Kettle chips, contain "yeast extract." On a chemical level, yeast extract is the same thing as MSG; it's just derived from a different source. Kettle labels some of their products with "NO MSG," but their reps say people who are sensitive to glutamates should avoid their products. Be an informed consumer.

review/summary: The BEST for sensitive stomachs
review/text: My dog has a super sensitive stomach; no people food except the occasional schnibble of bacon or Cheerios for treats. There are probably other things, but we stopped looking bc it usually backfires, if you get my meaning.<br />He ate Royal Canin for 4 years, but unfortunately they changed the recipe and now he won't eat it.<br />I was looking for Gluten-free, but learned that it was likely the poor quality ingredients and fillers that we had to look out for.<br />I researched a lot, read reviews, read and compared ingredients by percentage,  and finally landed on Natural Choice Chicken Rice. It smells good, and is really natural.<br />We had to go cold turkey since my poor dog would dig around to avoid his old food. My vet said just do it and watch him for a few weeks,, not just a day or 2.<br />He loves Natural Choice, and never had a single reaction to the food, which isn't at all what I expected! No change is anything, even his breath is fresh.<br />I love this product, and don't mind paying a slightly higher price for much higher quality ingredients.

review/summary: This Is NOT The Original BBQ Sauce
review/text: When Tony Roma's opened his wonderful restaurant on Biscayne Boulevard in Miami Beach, Florida I was an immediate fan.  I thought I had surely died and gone to heaven every time I ordered a full rack of Baby Back Ribs.  There were no "heat" or flavor choices...he only had one sauce then and it's not this one.  It was the very best of the best I've ever eaten and I enjoyed them for many years.  Even when he and his partner, Bobby Rubino split up, and Rubino opened his own rib place I sampled those and knew they had shared the recipe for this scrumptious delight.  The sauce they tout as original here is by far and no where near the original taste. This is a tad worse than ordinary and not worthy of the baby back ribs I purchased especially for this sauce!  I even cooked the rack in two different ways.  I split it in half, wrapped them in loose foil, and slow roasted them in a 250 degree oven then browned them off at the end and I marinated the other half, steamed them through and browned them off as well.  Roma's had an open rotating grill on which the ribs were browned off for final presentation and eating.  Tender...yes!  The slow cooking did that but that taste...that taste I remember so well was absolutely absent from the meat.  Don't waste your money or ribs on this.

review/summary: Smells Nice When You Open The Tin But That's It
review/text: Having bought loose flavored teas a few years ago I  was glad to have at first seen a seller that was giving these flavored teas on Amazon,  but while the aroma smells nice there is hardly to no taste to any of the teas.  When you get the teas it says to add a Tsp for every 6oz but you almost have to triple that amount to get any kind of distinction of taste from the teas,  the only one at all that has any taste for the amount directed is the mint tea which with its powerful aroma is no surprise.  All I can say is this isn't worth the price try another seller or just stay with the teas you like now,  because even for Amazon prime members who can get the free two day shipping $25.00 dollars for this poor level of quality tea is not worth wasting your money on.  Now that I know better the one thing I regret is not being able to get my money back for this poor choice of selection....

review/summary: Best fruit gums available!
review/text: Rowntree Fruit Gums are without a doubt the best fruit gums I have ever tried, and I have tried many brands. Nothing has come even remotely close to Rowntree. These are firm little fruit flavored treats that take some effort to chew. There come in five flavors: strawberry, orange, lemon, blackcurrant and lime. They are slightly similar to wine gums but do not have the same strong aftertaste.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Excellent as always
review/text: Every time I travel to the UK for business or to visit family, I pick up a dozen rolls of fruit gums. Rowntrees, of course - these are the REAL fruit gums. I had just finished my last roll and was beginning to think about whether I could justify another trip over, when it occured to me that the internet offers  opportunities one never could imagine a few years ago. So I found these Fruit Gums on Amazon and ordered 10 rolls. Believe me they are EXACTLY the same ones I was spending $1200 on airfare to pick up for years. Not substandard ones make for export, not old ones past their sell-by date. These are outstanding tasty fruit gums, especially so because I don't have to fly 8000 miles to get them. What a novel idea - have the fruit gums come to me instead of me going to get them. Now I think I will try to find some Cheese and Onion crisps.

My Vet uses this product and recommended that I switch right away because it's such a high quality food. Once I put her on Evolution she had a speedy recovery.

review/text: Last week i was starting to get congested and i definitely had the beginnings of a sore throat and some PM coughing. This usually means that a deep chest cold is on its way. Everyone around me had full-blown colds/flus/sinus infections, so i knew that I must have contracted something from one of them. I immediately brewed 6 bags of this tea in a pot and drank it all day. I did the same thing the next day. This totally nipped my sickness in the bud, preventing me from becoming fully sick like everyone else. I think that if you use this at the first signs of impending illness, you can turn it around and prevent a full-fledged cold.

It's gorgeous with large crystal shapes that are very thin, some are just flakes, but other pieces are like shallow hollow pyramids.

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Training Treats
review/text: Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.

review/text: We were big fans of Midel graham crackers before we moved to Canada.  We couldn't find them here and so we were thrilled to find them on Amazon.  The ones we received from Amazon are quite different from what we were used to buying off the shelf in the States.  They are small squares, not regular graham cracker sizes, and as has been noted, they're all broken up, even the flimsy trays that hold the crackers are broken up.  Finally, down to our last 4 boxes, they've gone rancid from lack of being used and we can throw them out guilt-free.  Even though we're huge fans of Midel Graham Crackers we'll never buy these again.  Too bad.

review/text: These are REAL graham crackers made with 100% whole wheat - they are different from ordinary "grahams" just like whole wheat bread is different from white bread. They aren't as sweet either, and have no hydrogenated fats, so these are definitely better for you than any other brand I've seen. No, you won't be able to slip these into your kids' lunchboxes instead of Keebler without them noticing, but they have a great grown-up, non-sugary, whole grain, satisfying taste and texture.
