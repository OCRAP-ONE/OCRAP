review/summary: Crunchies are not crunchy
review/text: This product is tastey but it is not "Crunchy" so I'm not sure where they got the name.  If you are looking for a freeze-dried crunchy strawberry you will have to get Cereal Toppers which I don't think are offered on Amazon.  These Crunchies are good on cereal with milk.  My four year old likes them but I'm not crazy about the soft texture.  Just Tomatoes brand has dried stawberries on this website that are better.

review/summary: I wouldn't especially recommend it for travels
review/text: I really wanted these to work for travels where I pack all my own food.  However, they are a fairly poor alternative for travels, since some of the fruit dissolves into very messy powder.  I also just couldn't get into the astronaut-food taste.  Even though it is totally real, it tastes artificial to me in this texture (unlike the blueberry flavor which is, however, even far messier than the strawberry flavor).  The quality and ripeness of the strawberries is consistent, however.  They are probably good for you if you want a stowaway fruit you can use when you haven't gotten to the store for awhile or want it out of season to sprinkle into something, but otherwise the price and messiness are both far too prohibitive (and I got them on sale).  I've bumped it up from two stars to three, however, after considering how they keep the enzymes intact and don't add sulfites.

review/text: Very disappointing.  I enjoy freeze-dried strawberries, but not these. My first pouch was quite sour, with little strawberry flavor. The texture is hard to describe...a bit like styrofoam that packs down in to a sticky mess.  I'm still trying to get strawberry out where the pieces have stuck on and between my teeth.  Very unpleasant.  I will try another pouch, maybe this one wasn't sealed correctly.  Or try the strawberries in cereal.  At this point I wouldn't recommend these as a snack for anyone.

review/summary: I'll take the orchid please!
review/text: Bought this tea as a result of being captured by a salesperson who made it impossible to say "no" and I am 100% to blame.  Never been a pushover but now, I have joined the club.  This tea is terrific and that is all that is important.  Our family has about 7-10 teas available at any one time and the Shanghai Orchid is a great "accent tea" to the plain teas...take a straight jasmine pearl or the Darjeeling or the silver needle and add some of the Orchid...wow!  The smell of flowers translates to taste beautifully.  Of course the price is high and I find it is confusing to purchase tea in the shop because of the "ounce" pricing...however if you use this tea as an accent rather than a straight tea, the idea is it will last longer.  My favorite is using this tea with any plan jasmine.  Amazing!

review/summary: If you're not going to make it from scratch...
review/text: Buy this chili. Really, I love to make chili, but it tends to be an all day (and somewhat expensive) proposition. This chili has a subtle and balanced flavor that one wouldn't expect from a can. As other reviewers have commented, it's not too hot nor too mild, but with this being such a subjective sort of thing, I'm not sure how helpful this type of information is. If it's too bland for your taste (I have a hard time imagining it would be too spicy, but it probably would be for my mom) you could kick it up with some hot sauce. What really impressed me then was not this "just right in the middle" characteristic, but the overall flavor and complexity of taste. Relatively good for you I suppose as well.

review/summary: Super yummy, but wish Amy's would make a lighter in sodium version
review/text: I love this canned black bean chili. First, it appealed to me for being chili, as I adore the stuff. Next, I grew up eating black beans frequently, so love em. And I was attracted to the organic label.<br /><br />I've tried various Amy's products, frozen and canned. Not so crazy about a lot of her frozen meals or pasta sauce (ew), but her soups have a lot of good candidates. This is one of the best.<br /><br />It stands up fine on its own, but for a more complete protein, I like to add whole grain pasta or rice. Sometimes, I go the traditional route and add low fat cheddar and onions. Sometimes, low fat cheese and low fat sour cream.<br /><br />This is a staple in my pantry, cause I"m lazy about cooking. I do like to add stuff to it, but definitely a nice chili for a canned version.<br /><br />I am not sure if there is a light in sodium version--but I sure wish there was. Amy's has some nice lighter sodium stuff, and I would happily purchase a version of this one with less salt. I use this a lot for quickie lunches at home.<br /><br />Do be aware that ordering via amazon means you're gonna get some dented cans. Always happens to me. Occasionally, the dents are so bad, I have to throw out a can or more. The last time, they were mildly dented, but still, wish they'd package the stuff better. Dented cans are worrisome.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: Amy's Organic Black Bean Vegan Chili - 14.7 oz.
review/text: This ia a nicely flavored pricey gourmet vegan chili.  Although it doesn't have that traditional chili taste, it is a uniquely flavored gourmet chili.<br /><br />The chili is mild flavored with sweet undertones.  This particular variety is low fat medium spicy.  It is actually not very spicy at all.<br /><br />The chili has no GMOs, no bioengineered ingredients, no trans fats, no added MSG, and no preservatives.<br /><br />The chili ingredients are organic black beans, filtered water, organic onions, organic tomato puree, organic diced tomatos, organic bell peppers, organic green chiles, organic high Oleic safflower and/or sunflower oil, organic lime juice, sea  salt, organic spices, organic garlic, and black pepper.<br /><br />The chili has 200 cal. per serving and the container states that it holds 2 servings.  Each serving is said to be one cup or 260 g.<br /><br />Each serving also contains 3 g fat, 680 mg sodium, 31 g carbs, 13 g fiber, 3 g sugar, and 13 g protein.<br /><br />I give this chili 3/5 for flavor, 5/5 for thickness and texture, 5/5 for maintaining organic integrity, 0/5 for truth in labeling.<br /><br />If my math is correct, a cup is still 8 oz. and the can only holds 14.7 oz. Therefore, two servings should equal 16 oz. and not 14.7 oz.<br /><br />The chili also has an extremely high sodium content 680 mg for a total of 1360 mg per can.

review/summary: Best Chili In a Can
review/text: I used to make my chili with ground sirloin but since I am attempting to eliminate red meat from my diet I tried Amy's Organic Low Fat Black Bean Chili. It is so tasty I truly do not miss the meat and it is loaded with protein and fiber. For those of you interested, it is also gluten-free. The sodium content is a bit on the high side, 680 mg per each 7.3 oz. serving but this is a thick hearty chili and quite filling so a little goes a long way. I like to make burritos using soft flour tortillas, Amy's chili, chopped green onion, shredded romaine lettuce, grated cheese and then top it all off with some salsa and a spoonful of sour cream. Yum! I can make five medium sized burritos from just one 14.7 oz. can. These burritos work well for a quick and healthy yet economical family dinner or a delicious snack when friends drop by unexpectedly. I have served this chili to many friends and family and no one has complained that it is too spicy, though some (guys) have reached for the hot sauce. I have also used this chili as a starter base for making large quantities of chili. Just add your own tomatoes, more chili seasoning to taste and anything else you like to make a delicious main course for potluck dinners or to feed the gang on football Sunday. I took a huge pot to a family reunion bar-b-que where my uncle, the consummate burger griller, decided to slather it on his cheeseburger and created a gourmet chili cheeseburger that all the meat eaters raved about. At just $2.68 per can ($2.28 on Subscribe and Save) you can't beat it for authentic mexicali taste and nutrition per ounce.

review/text: This product contains BPA, which is known to be very dangerous to health.  The following is a quote from the Wikipedia article on BPA:<br /><br />"Bisphenol A is an endocrine disruptor, which can mimic the body's own hormones and may lead to negative health effects.[23][24][25][26] Early development appears to be the period of greatest sensitivity to its effects.[27] Regulatory bodies have determined safety levels for humans, but those safety levels are currently being questioned or under review as a result of new scientific studies.[28][29]<br /><br />In 2009 the The Endocrine Society released a scientific statement expressing concern over current human exposure to BPA.[30]"<br /><br />The Wikipedia article is much longer and contains lots of information on BPA.  It's all bad news.  Amy's canned products all contain BPA.  This is unfortunate because Amy's recipes are good tasting.  Amy's is aware of the problem and have been "researching it" for years now.  But they can't seem to get around to removing this dangerous poison from their products.<br /><br />It's not worth the risk to yourself, your children, and your unborn children.  So please avoid this product and any other that contains BPA.  When Amy's does the right thing and stops using BPA in their canned products, they'll be fit to eat.  But not until then.

review/summary: A Great Product for Dieters
review/text: I've been on a calorie restricted diet for months and it's the taste of grains (bread, chips, crackers)that I miss the most. I find these Thin Crispbreads from Kavli to be the perfect solution. They are ultra thin. I mean they are thinner than you might think possible.<br /><br />As soon as I saw the first one I was amazed it made it through the shipping process in one piece. So far I have not come across a single broken cracker. My next thought was...."well, as soon as I bite into it, the thing's going to explode into a thousand tiny shards. I was amazed when it held together and showed only a perfect half moon hole where my teeth had been. These crackers really hold together nicely. The Garlic flavor is pretty subtle and there is a good amount of salt (which is missing on the plain Kavli Crispbreads). .<br /><br />I use these in place of bread, crackers and chips. A little ham, cheese and mustard makes a great sandwich, a few slices of jalapeno and just a few strands of grated extra sharp cheddar make very passable low calorie nacho. Use your imagination.

review/summary: Light and crisp...but too salty
review/text: I normally enjoy all of the Kavli crispbreads and was really looking forward to trying this one.  It's light, crispy, holds up well under heavier toppings such as vegetables, and is low calorie.  However, I found this product to be too salty, even for a confirmed salt lover such as myself.  The salty-garlic flavor can overwhelm many toppings, especially those already containing salt.  A fresh, sliced tomato with herbs, no salt, is fine...adding a little salted hard cheese such as Parmesan decimates the flavor of the cheese.  I ordered a subscription because the price was fantastic, but I'll be cancelling it and replacing it with another Kavli crispbread product.

review/text: I grew up on this syrup and don't like maple so I love this syrup<br />I have tried other cane syrups but this is the BEST.  I sent some to my daughter<br />who by the way won't eat any other kind either and she was sooooo happy.  We can't find it in the stores anymore so we have to order it.But that's ok cuz we can still get it anytime we want.  Thank you so much for making it possible to get my one and only syrup.

review/text: The taste is there. I would definitely eat this again. With toasted wheat bread, some mustard and onions it makes a very filling meal. Reason I am giving it two stars is because the can is absolutely horrible, filmsy engineering! Once I pull up the cap it breaks immediately. Luckily there was a can opener around. Could of made a real mess and cut myself in the process.<br /><br />If I am hungry and the only brand around is Roland then I will take another chance at it. Other than that there are so many other reliable brands out there at the supermarket.

review/summary: If you like mushrooms
review/text: These do have the flavor of mushrooms, and as on ingredient list, now if you are looking for whole or pieces of mushrooms, you won't find any. That said these are good tasting , again if you like the flavor of mushrooms. I just finished off my 1st can ever & thoroughly enjoyed them, now myself I eat a variety of sardines, herring, aqnd tuna variety to suit my pallet on a mostly daily basis, I am always looking for something different, I like KIng Oscar Mediteranean variety, as well as polar with paprika or hot tomato, as well as most smoked varieties.So don't let the guys 1 star scare you away, now I don't know for my 1st time I would buy a large amount, but my local specs store carried them, which is where I spotted them. Enjoy your Omegas.

review/summary: Vegan Natural Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. From Norway. Great rye flavor, which is the most traditional Scandinavian variety. Beautiful rye flakes adorn the top of each piece. Two airtight packages per box. Wafers are the size of half of the front of the package standing upwards, comparable to a graham cracker. Low fat. 30 Kcal with only 2.5 Kcal (0.25g) from fat per wafer. About half the thickness of a saltine, but stronger. Very enjoyable with chili or soup or for appetizers. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.

But I JUST noticed a big discrepancy in nutritional info on package versus Amazon website which states: Serving size: 2 pieces; Calories 60; Dietary Fiber 7g (26%)<br /><br />On the package I just bought it states Serving size 1 piece, calories 40, fiber 2g (8% daily value) so 2 pieces would be 80 Calories, Dietary Fiber 4g (16%)<br /><br />Wish I had an older package to compare to see if info has been revised.

review/text: I like nearly everything about Kavli Crispbread, but with one caveat.  It has good taste and is an excellent product from a nutritional standpoint. I originally purchased it because of high ratings by a noted nutritional newsletter. The only concern I have is that it is hard to eat.  I had to quit using it because I find it to be too hard on my teeth.  I only write this review to inform those who may have sensitive or weak teeth to be careful.  It is similar to eating popcorn or other hard seeds which my dentist cautions me about.  Other than this, I would highly recommend it as a well made food product!

review/text: I discovered these crackers when I was on the East Coast and was trying to find something besides whole wheat.  I try to eat whole grains.  I was shocked when I saw the fiber content for two crackers at 7 grams and only 60 calories!  I put peanut butter and banana on these crackers and it tastes great!  I don't know how much I would enjoy these crackers on their own.  They probably taste like cardboard (kind of look like it too!).  So I would highly recommend putting something on them - hummus, cheese, peanut butter, etc.

At that time I never drank coffee but I had opened a Bookstore and a small coffee shop and needed a good coffee. I found Coffee Masters and have never looked back. Yes it cost a little more than some other coffees but the taste bets all. It doesn't have a strong coffee taste and it is just plain great.You need to give it a try, I like it so well I wish I could be a salesperson for it.

I also just discovered that they make a pod filter in which I can place my own coffee grounds.  I will order two of these and test them. I feel this may be the answer.

review/summary: Darker, stronger, please!
review/text: I love the convenience of Senseo pods--pop 'em in, fill the water tank, and press the start button. The dark roast is my favorite, but I wish Senseo would come out with a French roast and other darker, richer varieties. I know there's a Senseo espresso now, but it requries purchasing an espresso pod holder, so I haven't tried it yet. Perhaps it would work in my regular two-pod holder if I used one espresso pod and one dark roast pod...haven't tried it yet. That works with other pod brands that I sometimes use with the Senseo pods--one of each in the two-pod holder. I tried Senseo Sumatra, but didn't go back; less satisfying than the dark roast. We go through six to eight Senseo pods daily at my house, so I take advantage of the handy automatic order process through Amazon. I love serving Senseo dark roast coffee to guests. They're always impressed by the foamy head and fresh-made taste and aroma. It's good coffee, but I sure would like more darker, stronger varieties.

review/summary: Senseo Douwe Egberts Dark Roast Coffee Pods
review/text: Senseo Douwe Egberts dark roast coffee is a finer cup of coffee than I've ever gotten in a (corporate owned) coffee shop. Using two pods produces a full bodied cup of coffee without a hint of bitterness. I used to spend hours grinding coffee beans and tamping down espresso in a portafilter. Now, I can get a cup of coffee that is infinitely superior to American auto-drip coffee (i.e. dish water) in under a minute.

review/summary: Use 1 pod to make two cups and save money!
review/text: One downside of a Senseo machine, is that unless you want an espresso size cup of coffee, you need to make 2 cups, which means you need two pods, at around 5.69 and bag for 18 pods, it can get pricey. The dark roast solves the problem. You put one in, and you make two cups! Before I found the Senseo, I was an average folgers, yuban mild coffee drinking type. I have the value pack on amazon grocery as a subscription...works out great!!

review/summary: Great coffee but please label pods
review/text: The Senseo coffee system is an excellent way to brew a good cup of single serve coffee quickly. It takes about 30 seconds so you can easily make another cup. I also like the variety of pods they offer. My favorite is the Kenya blend. The Dark Roast is good when I want a more robust flavor. What I don't like about the Senseo pods is that the individual pods are not labeled with the name of the blend. I would like to put all of my different senseo pods into the same airtight jar for display but I can't do this because I would not know which pod was which blend--they all look the same. So in order to know which pod is which blend, I must keep all the pods in their original packages and since the packages do not seal once opened, the pods can go stale. I suppose I could keep all my opened Senseo packages in a large tupperware container but that is such a hassle and so unattractive.

review/text: We have tried quite a few flavors of Senseo coffee and our preferred flavor is Senseo Douwe Dark Roast Coffee. We didn't quite like the "cappuccino" flavor though. We love Senseo coffee machine for its convenient single serving pods and easy cleanup. It is reasonably priced considering the convenience it offers.

review/summary: Senseo Dark Roast Coffee
review/text: I love the Senseo Dark Roast Coffee in the convenient single serve pods.<br />I had never tried it before I bought a Senseo Single Serve Coffee Maker.<br />The taste of the coffee is rich and robust and the flavor stands up to my adding a little bit of creamer. It is never bitter, but always yields that rich roasted flavor that I love.  I often recommend it to my friends and family and I would never want to go back to my old brand after finding Senseo Dark Roast Coffee.

review/text: Excellent coffee at a reasonable price.  The Senseo coffee system requires a coffee pod to work properly.

review/text: The Senseo is a great machine when you don't have time to make and enjoy a pot. I still enjoy the weekend pot of coffee however this is great for a quick fix.<br /><br />The reason I give the Dark Roast the 5 stars is because its the fullest flavored product they currently have. If you thought the other flavors were just too weak try this one.

review/summary: Best value, decent flavor
review/text: With 18 pods, this is the best deal for Senseo pods, but the flavor of the coffee is less bold and flavorful than some of the other flavors.  The dark roast is strong - certainly not espresso strong, but drinkable.  Mild and medium are too weak to enjoy.<br /><br />The Kenya and Sumatra pods are as strong as the dark roast pods and have a better flavor.  Unfortunately they are packaged in 16 instead of 18 per package.  These are available at a regional discount grocery store (Marc's Grocery) for $3.33 per pack and can often be found at other grocery stores with a similar sale price.

After my first cup, I could shoot a hunting buddy in the face, and still feel like a hundred dollars. When it comes to the coffee you have to pour bourbon in to forget your transgressions, this is the stuff that goes from 0% proof good to 70% proof great!

review/text: I recently sent for a Senseo Coffee Pod maker on a very good deal, & was looking here to get the pods. I read a lot of the reviews, & was looking foward to getting them here, plus this brand sounds like it would be to my taste. However, they apparently don't ship to Alaska! At least it said they don't ship to my location, & since I have gotten other items from Amazon, I assume it's the Alaska location. How disappointing, after reading so many great reviews. Just had to vent a bit. I enjoyed the reviews, though, they really are a help, good & not-so-good.

review/text: I first experienced Douwe Egbert coffee when I lived in Brussels, and happily sipped it daily for several years. Imagine my dismay when returning to this country I found no equivalent that could spark my taste buds to the same degree no matter how many coffee vendors I tried.<br />At long last, I once again have a deeply satisfying, caffeinated nectar to sip as I gradually come to life each morning on my patio overlooking the lake. Thank you Philips and Douwe Egbert for adding immensely to the quality of my life and bringing Europe back to me, if only for a few minutes each day.<br />As a postscript, let me add that I think the Senseo coffee maker, for the price, is superb.
