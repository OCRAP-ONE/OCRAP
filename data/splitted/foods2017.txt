review/summary: Excellent...my picky eating dog loves it.
review/text: My Assistance Dog loves this food.  After trying numerous foods for dogs with sensitive stomachs, and him refusing to eat, I gave him this Science Diet dog food, as recommended by his vet, and he gobbles it down.  His 'job' is very stressful and he is a very sensitive, alert dog, which leads to his stomach being easily upset, but with Science Diet, he has no problems and loves the food.  I am homebound and ordering the dog food can be pricey, so occasionally I try another high quality brand, but he won't even give it a try...well maybe a bite...but then he sits down and looks at me like 'okay, is this a joke, where's the good stuff?'...it may cost a little more, but he is worth it and earns every bite!

review/summary: Impressive Structural Integrity
review/text: I am highly impressed by the quality of this product, both in it's seemless merging of both chocolate and peanut butter components and for it's ability to hold up under adverse physical conditions.<br /><br />Conditions like, for example, a roommate stealing it and trying to play keep away in which said cup was caught in a kind of high five with the cup in the middle smushing it with considerable force. After which it was thrown across the room at high velocity.<br /><br />The cup survived all this without even a scratch or loose bit of chocolate in the wrapping.<br /><br />Truly the reeses big cup is a marvel of modern engineering science. And tasty to boot.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: My boyfriend and I recently moved to the US and were very disappointed by the American style chorizo (yuck!). We decided to try ordering some stuff online and wow this product is probably one my best purchases ever! At first we bought three sausages - then once they were gone we bought five that we are currently working our way through. This product is the real stuff: it has wonderful taste (smoked paprika yuuum...) and just the right firm texture. Do buy the hot version though - don't worry, it's not very hot :-)

review/summary: Outstanding product..  The Real Thing.
review/text: Outstanding chorizo..  My favorite use is to crumble/dice it into small pieces with potato dishes, or with sauteed mushrooms, peppers and onions to transform a Trader Joe's $4 cheese pizza into pure pizza heaven ..  Spanish chorizo's smoky, earthy flavor will dominate anything you eat it with - so unless you're wanting to eat it as a tapa (excellent with a nice spicy syrah/shiraz), use it in smaller portions.  My favorite use so far - a Spanish twist on a Mexican breakfast burrito..  Dice some up with some fried potatoes, onions, red pepper, and eggs with some grated Majorero cheese..  Unbelievable.

review/summary: Exceptional !!!! ( but addictive )
review/text: This product is truly exceptional ! A friend of mine showed it to me  a couple of years ago and since then I had it permanently in my refrigerator. I eat it every morning in omlete; also I can eat it as a snack. It is fully natural and very dry, so it's not expensive considering that most of the meat products contain lots of water. The web retail price is prohibitive, in Wegman's is like 6$. Be careful that its highest quality makes it addictive.<br /><br />Disclaimer : Never bought it from Amazon or online.

review/summary: Hot with flavor
review/text: I found this stuff at Firehouse Subs, and I fell in love with it. In fact, they ran out at the Firehouse that I generally frequented so I actually came here to find it. Firehouse just wasn't the same without it, honestly. It's pretty hot. I haven't been there for a while, but they rate their hot sauces there on a 1-10 scale, and I'm rather certain this is rated with an 8. It's warm. If Tabasco or Tapatio is too hot for you, you might find this to be a bit ridiculous. If on the other hand, you could bathe your food in those sauces, you'll be fine with this. It's hot but there is definitely hotter stuff out there. A lot of sauces seem to focus on the heat and not the flavor, but that's not really the case here. This stuff actually has a really nice flavor to it. Flavor's pretty subjective, and to be frank, I'm not sure I can effectively describe the flavor. Get one bottle, or try it out if you've got a hot sauce store or a Firehouse Subs around... It's my go to sauce if I'm looking for something that packs a punch. For me, I don't really need anything hotter, and it's hot enough that I still hang onto a couple other milder sauces for days when I'm not feeling quite so frisky.

review/summary: Another Great Variety From A Great Dog Food Product
review/text: I've been feeding my puppy Taste of the Wild for a few months now and my dog like it (and i like giving it to him). I've been buying the Wetlands Formula as well as the High Prairie formula and decided to shake things up a bit and get this version to mix in with the Wetlands formula, for variety.<br /><br />You can tell it has Salmon in it cause it has a moderate fish smell to it, a more stronger scent than the other varieties and like the other varieties, my dog loves it. I feel great feeding it to him as it is a great holistic brand of dog food. I'm intrigued to try any other varieties that TOTW has. I think i prefer buying the 5lb bags and mixing and matching the different varieties daily instead of one 15 or 30lb bag to keep my puppy guessing what his food is gonna taste like the next day LOL. I also add a TINY bit of hot water to the food on his picky days to unlock the aroma and taste of the food. I also add a small amount of the yellow box Cheerio's to give him some Whole Grains.

review/summary: Smooth Move to new dog food
review/text: My 10 month old Boston terrier / Chihuahua puppy,Luce', loves this. It kinda smells like food for fishes, but she cannot back away when I pour the food into her bowl lol I followed the direction on the label and mixed the old dog food with the new and let her get used to it. It turns out that she ate all the new food first before the old ones. One thing I have to note is, she has to go out sooner to potty than the previous food. That makes it more convenient for me. Luce' definitely loves this. The only bad side is that the bag is not resealable/zip-lock, but I fixed it up by taping it back. It works wonders and so does the fresh food.

review/summary: Cured my dog's weepy eyes!
review/text: Our dog always had weepy eyes, and the veterinary opthamologist suggested that it was possible she was allergic to her food.<br /><br />I tried this food because the ingredients were completely different than the food we had been giving her (Eukanuba).  Her weepy eyes dried up for the first time, ever.  It smells rather fishy, so I tried the venison one, and the weeping started again. So back to the "fish food", and no more weepy eyes. To limit the fishy smell, I just make sure to close up the bag tightly so it is limited to what I put in her bowl - which she finishes quickly!  ;)<br /><br />I made the mistake once before (but not this time!) of switching our dog's food abruptly, and my advice to you is that if you decide to switch your dog's food, phase it in slowly over a week, because otherwise you may be dealing with a case of doggy diarhea - yuck! - take it from someone who knows! (I was told better, but I did it because I was nearly out of the original food & didn't want to buy more of it.  In hindsight, it would have been worth the price of a 30 pound bag to avoid what our dog & I went through!)

review/summary: Very Nice Medium Roast Flavor
review/text: To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words "Medium Extra Bold" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Amazon should correct that description  and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other.

review/summary: My Favorite by a Landslide so Far
review/text: I must admit that I have gone a little overboard with my k-cup sampling.  So far I must have tried about 50 different blends.  OVerall I must say that the vast majority of them have been pleasant, better than what I used to make in my coffee brewer.  Then I tried the Donut Shop brand.  When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about.  When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing.  Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe.  My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day.  Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one.  It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite.  I will still search for something better, but I doubt I will find it.  I hope you like -- no strike that -- I hope you love this coffee as much as I do.

review/text: I've had my Keurig brewer for 5 months and have tried a lot of brands and the Coffee People Donut Shop regular is among my favorites. Green Mountain Nantucket Blend and Timothy's Italian Blend are also favorites.<br /><br />One reviewer remarked about Subscribe & Save costing less. It's only a dollar and a few pennies cheaper than this packaging and Subscribe and Save does not offer Donut Shop "regular" but instead has "Extra Bold". Also, this packaging gives you 50 k-cups as opposed to 48 (2) 24 count packages in Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about not having the standard boxes to dispense the coffee. I purchased a K-Cup carousel, available on Amazon for $19.95 that holds 26 k-cups; it looks nicer by my Keurig than cardboard boxes.

review/summary: Wake Up To Caffienated Perfection!
review/text: We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year, so we've been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible. This coffee is -- BAR NONE -- the best of the bunch. It is rich, syrupy and just a bit sweet. My experience, thus far, has been that the K-Cups listed as "extra bold" produce the best cups of coffee, but many of those are only available in dark roasts, while I prefer a medium roast. If you're a fan of a good, old fashioned diner-style cup of coffee (like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that), then this is the brew for you. We love it and make sure we always have some on hand.

review/summary: Great taste - poor packaging wastes k-cups
review/text: I love the taste of this coffee.  But apparently they have poor quality control.  These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly.  You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to.  Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem.<br /><br />It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens.<br /><br />I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them.<br /><br />Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing.

A good, strong cup of coffee is hard to come by when you are using some of these newer brewing machines, but the Keurig system is definitely the exception and this variety of k-cup is the best we have ever tasted.

review/text: I have tried many, many brands and blends in my Keurig coffee maker and this is definetely one of my favorites.  The type of coffe I drink depends on my mood.  Sometimes I want a strong, bold cup like, Newman's Own Extra-bold Special Blend K-cups, 80 Pk for Keurig Brewers and sometimes I want something more mild like, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NP30XQ">Green Mountain K-Cup Single-Serving Coffee 108-ct.- Nantucket Blend</a>  But ever since I have had my Keurig I have been looking for one of my favorite coffees.  The Dunkin Donut brand.<br /><br />This coffee is superb and very much like the Dunkin Donut brand.  Not bold or bitter.  Not weak or under flavored.  It is smooth and very flavorful.  It is the perfect crowd pleasing blend for any time of day or night.<br /><br />I have shopped all over and you can't beat the variety or the price here on Amazon when you join their club.  A great value.<br /><br />I do wish that Amazon would change the name by removing "Extra Bold".  It is not.  It is, at most, a medium roast.  Even when brewed with the smallest setting of the Keurig I would not concider it bold.  It comes out great on the medium size setting.  Very remanicent of that great cup of Joe you would get in the old days at your favorite diner.

review/text: Just left packaging feedback, but upon review, the issue appears to be quality control.  I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each.  In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in.  Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.  I hope the folk at Coffee People can rectify this situation, as this is my favorite coffee, but I will not order this product again without some resolve on their side.

review/text: Our westies love the Caesar Canine Cuisine foods, they seem to prefer the pates to the sauced varieties, but they eat all of them. I like to give them a big variety of flavors and Caesar's food comes in so many wonderful flavors. This is one of their favorites.  And it is a better deal than in the stores.  So that is super for me.

review/text: Convenience size container. Food is always fresh. I have one 10 lbs baby that should weigh 8 pounds so Vet suggested cutting her food back and adding canned green beans. The gravy is just the right amountto flavor the green beans and she loves it. So much, I have had to do this for my not over wgt dog, too. Great Product and delivery.

review/summary: Excellent product, exactly as advertised.
review/text: I have a basenji dog that is a bit "picky" and will not eat some dog foods (I have tried several of the "premium" and "super-premium" dog foods.<br /><br />He loves several of the Cesar Canine Cuisine foods and this is one of his favorites.  There is never any hesitation when I put his food down, he digs right in and consumes it almost instantly.<br /><br />There have been no GI upsets with this food - his stools are completely normal.  Traveling with him is easy with this food because it doesn't require refrigeration and no mixing - although I do give him dry food to "snack on" at will, he usually eats only a small amount of this and only when he has been very active.<br /><br />He gets two packages a day, one in the morning, one in the evening so a pack of 24 lasts 12 days.

The blend of Earl Grey and Raspberry is delicious hot or cold. I use one bag with 2 of the Mojito Mint to make a wonderfully refreshing iced tea.

We go through quite a bit of this canned food when they aren't eating raw and after trying several different natural brands we have stuck with Blue because they seem to digest it very well! Yard cleanup is as easy as it can be with 4 dogs with this food and that makes me a satisfied dog mom!

review/summary: Great Churro Maker
review/text: If you are looking for a great churro maker for your kitchen, this is it.  If you have tried making them with a pastry bag, you know that sometimes the dough can be to thick for the bag to handle.  This churro maker is well constructed and made with a sturdy plastic (almost like PVC tubing).  Rather than squeezing like you would do with a pastry bag, you turn the handle like a screw.  This provides equal and constant pressure to the dough as it exits to the frying pan giving you better control on the size and shape of the churro.  This churro maker is easy to clean - it can be taken apart and all the pieces are dishwasher-safe.

review/summary: Wet
review/text: This water is good and wet.  When you put the bottles in the fridge, you get cold water.  This water will quench your thirst and is suitable for most situations where water is called for.  Some applications, like filling a swimming pool or showering, may infrequently arise.  In such instances, this water will work but you may want to look for a substitute in much larger bulk.<br /><br />The clear plastic container probably does not leach chemicals into the water, but even then, it is not very environmentally friendly.  The actual water is pretty good and I haven't found any floating debris or anything bad or smelly in it.  You may also want to save money and take your own H2O with you, consider the Sigg Classic Bottle - Traveller (0.6-Liters).<br /><br />Our bodies all need water - get some any way you can.

review/text: SUMMARY:<br />I have been consuming this product for about 8 months and have come to enjoy the taste and convenience of the Vinacafe Instant Coffee Mix 3 in 1. I even toss a few into my suitcase if I'm traveling so that I can easily enjoy it from a hotel, customer site, corporate office visit, etc.<br /><br />EASY PREPARATION:<br />It's a great way to enjoy a hot coffee-genre beverage without all the effort of setting up the coffee pot.  You just get some hot water, stir in one packet of Vinacafe and enjoy.<br /><br />COST:<br />The deal I got for this off Amazon does not beat the less expensive price of the closest Chinese market.  However, to get these at the Chinese market, I have to drive into town (about 15-20 minutes) and I would have to plan to stop there only when I go to town for other tasks.

review/text: oat flour is a good source of protein and fiber. It worked fine in my homemade bread along with white and wheat flours.  it is nicely flavored and light textured. I didn't like it as much in crepes where it was the only flour used. it worked great in place of white flour for high altitude brownie mix instructions.  I like Bob's Red Mill high quality products.<br />We are on Amazon Prime, so order arrived quickly.  Amazon Prime is delightful!  I highly recommend that too.

review/text: My cats have been eating this food for at least six years and they love it.  I buy both tuna with egg and tuna with cheese and these are their two favorites.  I have my cats checked out at the vet annually and they have always been very healthy.  One of my cats, rescued from shelter, was never introduced to "wet" food as a kitten and only drinks sauce from cans with chunks of meat or fish - since this is shredded tuna, he eats this food without problems.  I have been buying this cat food for years and will continue buying it.

It was so bad we had to wash her rear end to get it all off. I'll be donating the rest to a shelter and hope other kitties fare better with it. We'll stick to her regular fish-variety Petite Cuisine and Fancy Feast Appetizers.

review/text: I first my dog these treats at my local pet store. I also only feed her Merrick dry dogfood because of the exceptional quality. The food as well as the treats are a little expensive, but worth it. I like giving these treats because they are natural, last as long as a rawhide chew but are made in the USA., they clean her teeth, they don't stink like pigs ears or hooves, and she LOVES them! At the pet store the cost $21 for a 6.5 oz bag, which average about 15 per bag. This price thru amazon is half the price, and they stay fresh so that's not even a concern.

review/summary: Licorice ambrosia
review/text: First tasted this candy on a trip to Canada a couple of years ago--had never seen it in the states. It was in a candy shop in Nelson, B.C. that had a wide array of licorice. When I asked the clerk for a recommendation on a good black licorice she said that this one, though not technically black, was a definite customer favorite. She gave me a sample and I was sold! I bought a bag and was soon sorry I had not purchased more. On our drive home we went through Montana and stopped at a little shop outside Billings that advertised over 40 different types of black licorice--but no chalk!<br /><br />This candy has a crisp shell and soft center with an indescribable licorice flavor. It makes my mouth water just writing about it.<br /><br />I am glad to see it available here, but wish it came in smaller quantities--I am the only licorice lover in my home and I already know my willpower where this candy is concerned.

review/text: YummyEarth makes the best tasting allergen free candy!  These gummy bears are soft, tasty and chewy.<br /><br />I bought these YummyEarth Organic Gummy Bears to include in my child's party favor bags.<br />Several of my child's classmates are allergic to corn, wheat, dairy, eggs and nuts.  As a parent of a child who outgrew his allergies and carried an Epi-Pen, I understood the challenges of finding a treat that you feel safe giving.<br /><br />It was a huge challenge to find candy that was both kid and mom approved - candy that tasted good, is allergen free, and wholesome.  These gummy bears are the best!  They come in small packets of 24 bags.  These are just the right sized packets.  There is enough gummy bears to let the kids eat now or save for later.<br /><br />I hope YummyEarth makes these small packets available year round.  I have only seen the larger 5oz bags, and the smaller 0.9 oz packet sold individually at my local grocery store.

review/summary: Not good
review/text: I love yummy earth hard candy and I love gummy bears.  I was very excited to get these, but they were a big disappointment.  BTW the bears I received were fresh so it's not a stale/dry bear issue. My objections are 1) Texture is too dense and chewy.  I like a softer gummy bear. These are a workout for your jaw.  2) The fruit flavors are indistinguishable from each other.  I can't stand that all the different colored bears taste the same.  I was expecting much better flavors from yummy earth based on the hard candy flavors which are very good. 3) Flavor is unbalanced.  These bears have a very one-note sweet taste.  There is not nearly enough tartness to balance out the boring sweetness.<br /><br />All in all, I do not recommend these and would not buy again.

I have just always loved them and let's just say that I'm old enough people in the grocery store think I am buying them for my kids (which I do not have).  The only problem is that my hubby and I are those organic people, so I had to seriously cut back on my gummy consumption.  I found these at like a Whole Foods and have loved them ever since.  But the price here is so much better.  I bring lunch to work everyday and these are perfect for that -- they are the highlight. I don't care that there are only 3 flavors and they are a little chewy on the outside.  You get used to that.  These are a great product if you care about eating organic.

Be aware - the individual bags are very tiny!
