review/summary: Mocha K-Cup
review/text: A little too sweet for us. However we had no problem swapping it to a friend for some coffee we enjoyed much more. She actually loves the Mocha blend and drinks it frequently.<br />We were glad to have the ability to swap it.<br />Delivery was exceptional as always. Cannot think of a single fault of "Prime Membership".. Thanks Amazon.!!

review/summary: More synthetic than Joan River's face!
review/text: I had the opportunity to try out Cafe Escapes' Cafe Mocha k cups when my boyfriend's sister gave us a couple of hers to try.  I was a little wary to begin with because I'd tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IPJTZE">Swiss miss Hot Cocoa K-Cup, Milk Chocolate, 12-Count</a> and remained unconvinced that chocolate flavored powders do well in the Keurig brewing system.  But since this was a chance to try a mixture of both chocolate and coffee, I couldn't turn it down.<br /><br />Unfortunately the final result was much like the Swiss Miss... way too fake!  Almost a plastic-like flavor.  Just awful.  The coffee side of the mizture was either too weak or watery because the mocha just tasted like watered down hot chocolate with a (very) little bit of bite to it.  Nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I'm glad I was able to try a sample of these pods rather than spending money on a box only to be disappointed.  I think a great alternative would be to brew a cup of your favorite blend of coffee and then add in a spoonful of your favorite hot chocolate.  A bit more effort, but the payoff will be leaps and bounds better than this one.<br /><br />This k cup is a pass for me.

review/summary: Very Bad!
review/text: If you're expecting rich smooth flavor similar to what you get from a coffee shop you'll be greatly disappointed.  This stuff is basically powdered hot chocolate and instant coffee.  You're better off brewing a pot of Maxwell House and adding some chocolate milk.  I'm extremely disappointed in this stuff.  Maybe I had my hopes set too high.  Yuck!

review/summary: It does taste like hot chocolate
review/text: This is a good mocha but you have to get used to this weird taste that it has. I can't figure out what it is but it almost has a weird texture. However, the more I drink it (I ordered a ton.. yikes) the more I like it.. it is definitely sweet and you don't need to add any sugar but I find it that I like it better with a vanilla-caramel creamer :) I wouldn't buy more than one box.. then if you love it, order more.

review/summary: Not really as good as you'd expect
review/text: I bought this because what I expect out of a Mocha coffee drink is, well coffee with a chocolate flavor. This is a hot chocolate drink with a little bit of coffee flavor (which I cant really pick up on but some non coffee drinkers were able to). Ingredients list basically the milk hot chocolate mix cafe escapes uses and toward the end just says "instant coffee". We all have different taste its true, and while drinkable this really wasn't close to the coffee shop quality mocha drink I was hoping for, but at less than 50 cents a k-cup I'll drink it and save money.

review/text: I am not a huge coffee drinker but I need some caffeine every once and a while. This is alright. It does taste like hot chocolate but on the largest cup setting it tastes like chocolate water. The middle setting is alright but I feel it tastes the best on the smallest cup size. Sometime I will mix 2 of the small cups together to get a decent size drink. I am a fan of the Cafe Escapes line as they taste very good and don't make a mess while making. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a small drink!

review/summary: Doesn't taste like a mocha on its own....
review/text: I bought these hoping to find a way to make a cappuccino-like drink using our Keurig.  This Cafe Mocha K-cup on its own tastes like hot chocolate.  It also tastes slightly watery and I really can't taste any coffee at all.  I was bummed since this isn't really what I was looking for.<br /><br />Since the chocolate taste was so strong & the coffee taste was so weak, I decided make a mug filled with half Cafe Mocha and half flavored coffee by selecting the small cup size for each.  Tada!  An at home Mocha!  I will continue to buy these so I can mix them with my other coffees.  If you don't mind using two k-cups per drink, they are a good way to go for a tasty at-home mocha.  If mixing this with another cup seems to expensive or like too much trouble, then skip these ones - I would give them only 1 star on their own.

review/summary: Good GF Cracker!
review/text: These crackers are normally on the expensive side, but Amazon was having a sale that made them only about $2 per box -- so I thought they would be worth a try. One thing I like about them is that each box has two pouches inside; each pouch has two "servings" so you don't have to worry too much about them going stale once the box is opened!<br />These crackers have a nice texture. The most noticeable flavor is kind of an anise seed taste, which I found surprising at first but it grew on me after I ate a couple of crackers. My son and I polished off the first little pouch we opened in a matter of minutes; we've both been missing a good cracker!<br />I don't know that I would pay full price for a case of these crackers, but I am going to go order more while they're still on sale! I think they'll be good with tuna salad, slices of ham and cheese, or any number of things that go well with crackers!

review/summary: WARNING! "New Improved Flavor" WARNING!
review/text: REPEAT BUYERS BE AWARE<br />Warning!!  "New Improved Flavor"  Warning!!<br /><br />This is one of very few reviews of any product I have bought on Amazon. Certainly my longest. Don't usually bother writing reviews online but I feel this is important enough to note so others will know. I did also write a note to the manufacturer.<br /><br />Glutino Multigrain Gluten Free Crackers were one of the few GF & dairy free crackers I really likED. My most recent order arrived and I popped one in my mouth and thought "did I order the wrong thing?". These crackers tasted totally different, & not in a good way! Only then did I take a closer look at the the box & noticed "new improved flavor!" printed on it. In my opinion, totally ruined the great (old version) flavor, just a blah, bland, nondescript cracker of worse consistency like most others. For those that disliked the fennel flavor you will be happy to know that the fennel has been removed, a bad thing in my opinion. If you wanted a bland GF multigrain cracker there are plenty of them out there. They don't work as well as they have for me in the past in settling my stomach because the fennel has been removed.<br /><br />!! The sodium content has increased by nearly 75% (260mg vs. 150 mg per same serving size) !!<br /><br />"new Coke" anyone?<br /><br />Why mess with something that WAS already a really great product? It is my feeling that "new improved flavor" really is "cheaper to make, worse flavor". What were they thinking?<br /><br />So I WARN potential repeat buyers - you should probably try a box if you can get it locally before ordering a case of the "new improved flavor". I am VERY disappointed! Will have to find a replacement!<br /><br />For those who would like to know and compare here are the ingredients from the boxes, original and "new improved" (and don't forget - w/75% more sodium)<br /><br />Original: CORN STARCH, WHITE RICE FLOUR, ORGANIC PALM OIL, MODIFIED CORN STARCH, DEXTROSE, LIQUID WHOLE EGGS, YEAST, SALT, FENNEL SEEDS, POPPY SEEDS, GUAR GUM, AMMONIUM BICARBONATE, SODIUM BICARBONATE, MONO & DIGLYCERIDES, NATURAL FLAVOR.<br /><br />New Improved: CORN STARCH, WHITE RICE FLOUR, ORGANIC PALM OIL, MODIFIED CORN STARCH, DEXTROSE, LIQUID WHOLE EGGS, PREGELATINIZED RICE FLOUR, SUNFLOWER LECITHIN, BUCKWHEAT BRAN, SALT, POPPY SEEDS, GUAR GUM, FLAX SEEDS, SODIUM BICARBONATE, AMMONIUM BICARBONATE, ROSEMARY EXTRACT

review/text: Unique flavor - read the other reviews!  If you are expecting a "Sun Chip" multigraind taste, that's not what you'll find with these crackers - they are unlike any "multigrain" item I've ever eaten.  Visible fennel seeds and poppy seeds in them - and the fennel taste is strong.  At first I thought black licorice, even.  Very strong.  Cheese on them helps to cut back on that flavor if you aren't a big fan of it.  Unfortunately, the case I ordered was past the expiration date, which I didn't realize until we'd eaten half of the first box!  So check that when you get them - but Amazon did an amazingly fast refund for me, which I thought was great customer service.  I'd probably try the plain flavor if I bought them again.

review/text: I had bought the "original" version of this brand of crackers a few months ago when I went gluten free. I thought they were... eh... not great (2-3 stars at best), but at least better than nothing when I'm craving cheese and crackers or want crackers in my soup. When I saw the "whole grain" version in a store last week, I picked up a box assuming I'd like these better. They are AWFUL!!! I don't know if I got a bad batch, but each bite has a horrible burnt aftertaste. They taste so burned, I'm looking closely at them to see if they are black on one side or something (they aren't). Is it the black speckly "multi-grain" inside? Maybe they burned the tiny seeds/grains and cooked them in anyway? Again, maybe I just got a funky batch, but I'm not buying these again.

They are 'heavy' now instead of light, and flavorless except for the oil taste.  Alot of the crackers are broken also.  I am so disappointed.  I should have sent them back, but I was hoping that only one box was affected.  Looks like they all are nasty and that I have nothing more than expensive bird food...if they'll even eat it.

review/summary: Cracker's OK for cheese or other toppings
review/text: I didn't find these crackers to have flavor, but they are a nice size and shape (about the size of a Ritz cracker, but heavier and sturdier), and they are perfect for topping with cheese.  If they're not especially tasty, at least they have none of the slimy glutinous feel of rice crackers either.<br /><br />I greatly prefer the taste of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YJBLMM">Crunchmaster Multi-Grain Crackers Gluten Free 20 oz.</a>, a very tasty cracker I have trouble keeping in the house because my non-celiac spouse loves them too.  But at least the Glutino crackers don't disappear when I'm not looking.  No one but me snacks on them, and their more substantial size makes them a better choice for cheese and crackers than the Crunchmaster crackers.

review/text: We ordered a 6 pk of the glutino multigrain crackers and was excited that the cost per box was cheaper than our local stores. The box arrived with bubble wrap and when we open the 1st foil pa lager inside the box mostly all crackers were in pieces. We decided to see if that was the case for all and 4 out of 6 boxes were in usable for entertaining as none of the crackers were whole. Great if we're using it to make bread crumbs but not to seatbelt during the holidays. Would not order again.

review/summary: Best GF Crackers I've Tried
review/text: I've been on a GF diet for almost a year now. Before being diagnosed with celiac disease, I loved eating crackers with soup, peanut butter, or other toppings. I was incredibly disappointed knowing I could never enjoy tasty crackers again. Well, after searching the market and trying (and wasting $ on) various GF crackers, I was alarmed. All the GF crackers I tried were terrible. They tasted more like a tortilla chip than a cracker. On a whim, I bought the Glutino crackers in Multigrain. Amazing! Not a ton of flavor, but will satiate most any palate. Great with other items. These are one of my new favorite GF items. I'm excited to try them with soup, or in casseroles. Enjoy!

review/summary: Pretty good! Better than most GF crackers.
review/text: Try these if you can't have gluten. Crackers are one of the things I miss most and these are a nice platform for a good cheddar,  creamed herring, or smoked salmon. I like the fennel overtones. As anyone who has ever searched for a great (or even good) gluten free cracker it's difficult.<br /><br />With that said, they often are broken and I hate the little foil pouches they come in - you can't reseal them or fold them over. I am looking forward to trying the vegetable Glutinos. I also wish they could be browned a little more - might give them a little more resistance to the teeth. At any rate, give 'em a try.

review/summary: Great Texture and Zingy Flavor.... Yum!
review/text: Okay, some people don't like much flavor -- and if you're one of the vanilla middle-of-the-road types who'd never touch a piece of rye bread or add a dash of fennel to a dish, these crackers *may* not be for you.. BUT, that being said, they have a GREAT texture (think Ritz like flaky crunch) with an almost rye bread type of taste (yes -- it's from the fennel -- but the flavor is very close to what you might remember having in a piece of rye bread). The flavor is not overwhelming, but it's there as a lovely addition to a great cracker. I LOVE these crackers.  Try them with some salmon salad on top for a treat(use canned pink salmon in place of tuna to make your salad)... whatever you do, realize you're going to want to gobble them down so make sure you have enough of them!  If these aren't for you -- try the original or cheese version.  Just keep them away from your non-GF friends/family -- they're so good they'll eat them up before you have a chance to do so.

review/summary: Like Crunchy Licorice.
review/text: One of the things that you do when you have to go gluten-free is utter a prayer before each new foodstuff:  "Please God, let it not taste weird."<br /><br />And these?  Seriously?<br /><br />They taste like crunchy licorice.  They even leave a licorice aftertaste.  Unless you are a non-taster, or you like unsweetened licorice, these are bad crackers. Children might use them to build forts, perhaps.<br /><br />However, the other Glutino crackers in this line are good.

review/summary: Good, but more like caramel soda instead of cream soda
review/text: I am quite fond of cream soda and was happy not only to find it for my SodaStream. I got it home and made it right away. It is good. Not amazing, but pretty good. It has a taste that reminds me more of caramel than it did cream soda. The best feature of this flavor is how well it mixes if you go half and half with the orange, or any of the fruity flavors to give it a bit of a Creamsicle flavor.

review/summary: I really really wanted to like this one
review/text: I am the type of person to continue to use something even when I don't necessarily like it just to get my full money's worth. This, though, I just couldn't do. I tried it with the amount of syrup suggested and it was so strong in both flavor and smell (with almost an alcoholish undertone to it) that I almost decided to forget trying it and threw it away. But I forced myself to try it anyway and it was as bad as it smelled. So then I thought maybe if I put way less syrup, it would be more to my liking. I mean, I LOVE cream soda. How could I not like this? But even with half the amount, I was still grimacing. And since I'm the only one in the house who uses the Sodastream (my husband can't handle anything with artificial sweeteners in it -- gives him a stomach ache -- and all of the Sodastream flavors have it) I stared long and hard at the bottle before finally tossing it into the trash.<br /><br />I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this one because I'm having such a hard time finding syrup flavors that I like. But nope. Can't handle this one at all which is a shame. In fact, while my reactions aren't nearly so bad as the one for this one, I've only found one that I absolutely love and that is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T0EX7U">Sodastream Diet Cranberry-Raspberry Sodamix Syrup</a>.

review/summary: Odd Smell, Odd Taste
review/text: I got a SodaStream last week (not from Amazon) and I've been going crazy using it ever since, trying all the different flavors. I love cream soda, so I bought a bottle of this. When I opened up the cap and sniffed, it didn't smell like cream soda, and, in fact, it smelled kind of gross. But I thought it might just be because it was as yet undiluted so I added it per directions to the one liter bottle. It still smelled yucky, and not at all like cream soda. It doesn't taste awful, but it certainly doesn't taste like any cream soda I've ever had and the smell (I know, I've said it a lot already but...) was overpoweringly bad.<br /><br />I'll probably try it again with A LOT less syrup, since  have a whole bottle, but I won't buy this flavor again.

Anyway, unless you like and can drink diet drinks you will not like 'regular' flavors either.

Plus the current price on Amazon with shipping is about what I pay for these packs individually when I buy them in my local supermarket. In fact these are widely available in supermarkets and drugstores, usually at the checkout register.<br /><br />Bottom line: These work well, but the current price on Amazon is no bargain.

review/summary: Bold and Mold
review/text: I admittedly liked this product.  People thinking "I like smoked salmon" may be thrown by this product at first, but think "jerky!!"  Very chewy: the larger pieces can give your jaw a good workout, and every once in awhile you hit a peppercorn which makes your eyes water (in a good way).  Good salmon flavor.  I would be a happy consumer except that I have run into moldy strips in two separate orders.  Got the 8 pak, and on pak #6, almost the entire contents were fuzzy.  An e-mail to the company got absolutely no response, but Amazon was kind enough to replace it in spite of it being a generally non-returnable item.  Unfortunately, the replacement jerky also had a white fuzzy mold pocket in one pak.  Not in every pak, but since you tend to chew jerky while busy doing something else (fishing, driving, whatever), it gave me the creeps knowing how little I looked at most of this stuff when shoving a strip "in between my cheek and gum."  Eat in good light and keep your eyes open.

review/text: This salmon jerky is so unbelievably tough, it is pretty much inedible.  And when you do painstakingly gnaw on it, it doesn't release much flavor, but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks in your mouth.  I had the misfortune of ordering this, and 7 of the 8 bags are still untouched, and I'm not sure what to do with them.  I even tried soaking the jerky, and tried boiling it with some macaroni, and NOTHING seems to soften this stuff up!  What a waste of money.  Go for some beef jerky instead, and if you need salmon, eat it fresh or canned.  This product is a joke.

I was wrong, very wrong.<br /><br />Where Snack Masters losses all it's credibility as being, "Snack Masters" is in the texture of this jerky.<br />How can they expect people to eat this stuff? It is very dry, rough, and sharp. If you've ever held wood bark in your hands then you know what it is like to hold this jerky.<br />If you try to snap a piece in half it makes the same noise as if you were breaking a chicken bone. I have a headache from trying to eat this stuff and I'm expecting puncture wounds in my stomach any minute now.<br /><br />If your teeth are made out of knives give this a go, if not stay clear.<br /><br />Taste: 6.5/10<br />Texture: 1/10

I have read others reviews stating the jerky was hard as a rock and thought they exaggerated for effect, I learned today they are not.  This will be the last time I order this product and I would hope that Amazon would take to providing a little better quality control on items like this.

review/text: SnackMasters Salmon Jerky is very nice. I have purchased it before in a national health food store, and sometimes it was very hard. The packages delivered from Amazon were perfect - not too soft and not too hard, just right.<br />The taste is what this jerky is all about, it does not have that fishy oily taste present in other products, just a burst of flavor that is finely balanced and long lasting.<br />Great product!

review/summary: Nice salmon jerky!
review/text: I was hesitating when I consider buying this jerky.  Somebody gave bad review of this product as dried out and brittle.  After I did a bit of homework on all salmon jerky available on market, I decided to give this one a try.  Today, I just received it and tasted it.  It is very yummy.  It is chewy but definitely not dried out and brittle. It is also a very good protein source, from the package, I see that out of 1 oz (28 gram), it has only 1 g of fat, 2 g of sugar, but has 16 g of protein - a super healthy food. This one is of original flavor.  I wish they have other flavor (like super spicy one so that it can last longer).  Anyway, I will reorder the salmon jerky after I finish this package.

review/summary: Nice chewy salmon jerkey.
review/text: I began buying salmon jerky after a trip to Canada a few years back. This salmon jerky is indeed chewy, so I would only recommend it to people having nice jaw muscles and enjoying chewing. For me, 20 minutes after receiving it, I already finished almost half a pack with no problem.<br /><br />Interestingly, after reading 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthy, I started to have the urge to have some non-perishable food at hand. But this is just a tasty snack in my opinion. It will not last you through the seemingly endless nuclear winter. The $10 discount code for $50 Grocery purchase makes it tastier for sure.

review/text: Although I was a little put off by a prior review that indicated this product was nearly inedible, we had purchased this salmon jerky at Trader Joe's in smaller packets and really liked it, so we decided to purchase here at Amazon much less expensively.  Yes, this product is very dry, but it also has none of the preservatives included in some of the more moist jerky products out there.  My family liked it, and we are placing a second order.  That other reviewer should send her inedible seven extra packages our way!

review/summary: tasty salmon jerky
review/text: This salmon jerky is definitely tasty.  It has a slightly strong peppery taste to it, which I really like.<br /><br />The previous reviewer was correct in thinking the jerky was a bit too dry and hard to chew.  It'll take you a while to bite a piece off and chew it.  My jaws were too tired to even eat a whole serving.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the jerky is quite tasty so I'm not dissapointed.<br /><br />These come in eight resealable pounches, each with 2 ounces of salmon jerky.  I'm sure these will last a while since it'll take a while to chew them all up.

review/text: You know how shortbread can frequently be boring?  Patterson's does a nice "finger style" and Royal Edinburgh does the very best petticoat tails, so it is helpful to only open these when you are sharing or just don't break the seal on the package in the first place--they are nicely crunchy without being too crumbly, and really nice flavor so the little devils call out to you when they are in the house.  Better than I bake on my own--and I have had practice!

review/text: This Fries Seasoning is really good!! It's not overly salty. You can taste the sour cream and onion powder. They blend really well together. I have sprinkled it on food other than french fries. It's really good on popcorn too!  I have sprinkled some on cooked rice. It gave it really good flavor. I also fried some flour tortillas and sprinkled some of this on the tortilla before putting anything else on it. It's really good on meat as well. This is a very versatile seasoning. I am definitely going to be ordering more of it. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. It's definitely worth the price. The 9 ounce bottle is bigger than I thought it would be.<br /><br />Thank you Fries Seasoning for such a great, versatile seasoning.

review/text: I ordered the Duncan Hines Angel Food Cake Mix because it had disappeared from the shelves of my local grocery stores.  The shipping was too much for the items ordered, but what disappointed me most was that the cake mix now uses dairy ingredients.  When I used to use it, it did not contain any dairy products and was a more versatile product for me.  The taste of the cake and the ease of preparation are still tops.  I just wish they had not added dairy ingredients.  I will not be purchasing this again.  Perhaps that is why it disappeared from the grocery store shelves.

review/text: I'm rather ignorant about plants, I will admit... but I was a little disappointed when I received this plant only to realize that it's an  outdoor plant.  At least I assume that it is because it came with an "Outdoor Bonsai Care" pamphlet.  It doesn't say anywhere in the description on here that it's an outdoor plant.  It is a beautiful plant but I don't have an outdoor area to keep it in so I'm going to wind up giving it to a friend.

There were no flowers on the plant I received, but it may bloom later in the year...we'll see.  I figure it will just be a green leafy bonsai most of the year.  I am satisfied with it and would recommend it.
