review/summary: Cats love it (not really a surprise...)
review/text: This is a good amount of catnip, and looks fresh and green, but I wasn't totally surprised at how awesome it was or anything - it was just catnip.<br /><br />Only, I was keeping it in the bottom drawer of our desk and I had forgotten about it, since we still have other catnip. One day I noticed my cat was really enjoying his time under the desk, which is normally because there's a nice sunny spot under the drawers and he likes lounging in it. However, this time I heard him poking around back there, which was strange, but he's a strange cat, so I didn't really think much about it. Then at some point, I opened that drawer for something totally different (I had forgotten about the catnip) and found that somehow he had gotten his paw over the back edge of the drawer and OPENED THE BAG OF CATNIP. I guess he had gotten little bits in his paw and been satisfied with that. I was blown away. This is good stuff. Strange-Cat-Sam-approved.

review/summary: Surprisingly good!
review/text: As soon as I brought the box containing this into the house my two cats started going nuts for it.  They are both normally very reactive to catnip, so this was not surprise, but wouldn't leave the box alone, even after removing the nip from it (which is very unusual for them).<br /><br />It's not the most premium of catnips, but it is much, Much better than the ditchweed that comes with most cat scratchers, and the bag is a great size for the price.  The bag is resealable, so it's easy to close shut and pop into the freezer to preserve freshness.  I'd re-purchase when local vendors are out of stock for the season, for sure.

review/summary: My cats love it!
review/text: I have two cats, one is 8 months old and gets excited about everything, and the other is almost 8 years old and gets excited about basically nothing. They both went crazy over this catnip before I even took it out of the Amazon box. I sprinkled it around their cat tree and put it inside some of their toys. It has worked a lot better than some of the "pre-filled" toys I bought in the past. My only trouble is finding somewhere to hide the bag so they won't get into it. Would definitely buy again.

review/summary: Smokey is hooked!
review/text: I knew this catnip would be a hit after watching my cat attack the Amazon delivery box before I could even get it open.  It was sitting on the end table and I couldn't figure out what her problem was until I remembered that I had ordered catnip along with other items.  But she definitely knew it was in there!<br /><br />Once I open the box, I was surprised at how much there is in 1 ounce of catnip.  The bag was a lot bigger than I expected.  And this stuff must be pretty fresh because it makes my cat absolutely loony.  We take one or 2 teaspoons and wrap it up in an old nylon with a rubber band and she'll play with it for days until it finally gets too soggy or breaks open.  Then we make her another one.<br /><br />I'll definitely consider ordering this again.

review/summary: A-OK
review/text: The product didn't arrive in the packaging pictured in the description, but that's neither here nor there to me. I actually think I may have gotten more catnip in my bag, than in the one shown.<br /><br />My cat was never really very sensitive to catnip, and he always seemed like he could take it or leave it. I was hoping this would inspire the zen-like rolling and blissed-out scampering that I've seen my other cats enjoy in the past. I don't think it was the product's fault that this in fact, did not happen. I think I just have a cat that cat nip has a negligible effect on.

review/summary: Bad batch? Our cats will not even touch it!
review/text: SHORT VERSION - We ordered this same product back in November 2011 and our cats LOVED it. Lasted a long time too. Just bought a fresh bag first week of September 2012 and this batch they will NOT even touch it! Bad batch??<br /><br />LONGER VERSION - We have 2 male domestic Tabby's almost 4 years old, and about once a week it's a ritual - we put the scratching post in the middle of the room and sprinkle two piles of Yeowww on the base, and it's kitty party time. They usually immediately start munching on it and rolling around in it, playing, and having a blast! We keep it sealed in a small plastic container for freshness and one bag lasted us a very long time, very happy kitties. BUT that was the first bag we bought. This new bag we just bought (same *exact* brand / packaging, same size, texture, smell) is a completely different experience for the cats. Following the same weekly ritual we sprinkled a couple piles on the bast of the scratching post and they came running over to get their usual "fix", but then something strange happened... instead of gobbling it up and having fun, both of them sniffed at it a few times and had no interest in it. In fact, what really amazed us was when one of the cats then tried to BURY it as if it were a pile of you-know-what, and then they both walked away. They wanted absolutely NOTHING to do with this fresh batch.<br /><br />We're absolutely puzzled by this and wondering - could this somehow be a "bad batch" that we received??<br /><br />I hate to give it 1 star but based on this experience I must. We now have to try to find a different brand that they liked as much as the previous bag of Yeowww. Big disappointment and a waste of money since it's not something we can't return for a refund (what could we base it on? I don't think saying "our cats didn't like it" would warrant a refund). Bummer :(

Brought the package in the house and my adult cat started getting on the table and the kitchen counter which she knows is not allowed.  I thought "what is wrong with this cat?" then I remembered what was in the unopened Amazon box.  She went crazy for it.<br /><br />She likes catnip but I guess the other stuff I've used isn't as fresh or potent because she never reacted quite like that before.  I guess this is her new favorite now...good stuff!

review/summary: A bit dissapointed
review/text: I was stationed on Grand Turk Island for 2 years while I was in the Navy,  one of the local delicacies in the Caribbien is Conch Fritters.  I am going to make some fritters soon and from a recipe From Grand Turk.  this turned out to be more pricy than I originally thought.  in a 15 oz can, you get 4.5 oz of conch meat and the rest is water, I paid almost $30.00 for less than a pound of meat.  I'll be looking for frozen product locally  or from another distributor.  Some of the Conch they sell from Amazon is over $100.00 a pound.  I don't mind spending $10.00 a pound no more than I will make this, But I can't afford these prices.  If you want to pay that much, then by all means go ahead.

review/summary: Not a bad product.
review/text: This review is for the boneless ham. A little on the small size, but tasty. Be sure to thaw before baking or you will dry it out. Best eaten the day its made. I sliced some for the next morning and it definitely lost something. On the plus side if you've got a family, odds are there will be nothing left.

review/summary: Price is right, product isn't
review/text: We've always bought the Halo Chicken Liv-a-littles treats for our cats, but they've recently reduced the package size and ultimately increased the price.  Decided to try these since they were about half the price.  First thing we noticed was that the chicken was noticably darker in color, and when we gave it to our cats this morning she could hardly break it apart.  One cat ate two small pieces, and refused to eat any more. (Normally she chows down the halo stuff) The other cat ate all of his and threw it up 3 minutes later.  Also in the package they have one of those packets, a really big one, that they use to absorb moisture. We will be throwing this out and sticking with the tried and true, sometimes you just have to pay for quality.

review/text: I've researched the ingredients and I think this is a high quality, clean product. But it's better for the cats if you add water to it, as even a vet on their website mentions. High-protein dry food is too dehydrating otherwise (all dry food wears on kidneys and urinary system).

review/summary: High quality cat food that my cats love!
review/text: I have three cats, one of which has IBS/digestive issues.  My vets recommended that I switch him to a food with the fewest ingredients as possible and that has an unusual protein (like lamb or venison).  I can get both of those with Ziwipeak!  And all three of my cats love it, which was a real surprise to me.  It took some getting used to since the jerky-style pellets are very different from feeding regular dry food.  But my cats adapted relatively quickly.  All three seem to be thriving on it.  I'm very happy to have found this food.

review/summary: KiwiPeak Lamb
review/text: I have two very picky cats. One has serious food allergy issues, so I've been trying out new foods. My cat with allergies LOVES this food, and it fortunately does not make him sick. The other cat, unfortunately will barely touch this food. He seems to like the smell, but he's really a dry crunchy food addict. The texture of this food is a bit odd. It comes in small flat squares that are dry, but a bit more like jerky than normal dry cat food (not tough like jerky, that's just the closest thing I can compare it to. I suppose you could even compare it to a chopped fruit roll up, made with meat puree instead of fruit). This food wasn't a complete winner for us, but it works for one cat at least.

Not even hungry stray cats that live outside of my house would even touch it. For the fairness of all consumers that are interested in this product. I will write out the whole sentence that appears on the back of the package and what has been crossed out. "Look for Ziwipeak  'Cuisine' in convenient pouches and easy-tab cans and Ziwipeak treats and supplements at leading natural pet stocklists.

I have wasted money and I have no way of returning it.

If you drink lots of pure water for all the obvious benefits, you will love Hint - it gives a very pleasant taste to plain water and it is good for you!  No junk added. They are delicious, particularly the watermelon. The woman who invented it put whole pieces of fruit in pitchers of water to get her kids to drink water instead of soft drinks. It worked. They all loved the taste and never went back to soft drinks. Then all her friends who would taste it at her house wanted the water. Soon she was making it for her neighbors and a brilliant product was born. Finally water that is 100% good for you without any junk added. 5 star rating for sure!

review/summary: One of my favorite flavors
review/text: I was wishing they would have a pineapple flavor, never saw any in the stores.  Then I went to their site and looked at all the flavors, a lot of new ones I didn't know they made and saw that one among the others.  Well, my most frequently shopped store has several of the newer ones but doesn't carry pineapple, but a store close to me I don't shop as frequently does carry pineapple.  I just got back with 4 at 66 cents each (should have bought 8).  I use it with evaporated milk and coconut milk and have pina colada jello.  I could dream up more things to do with it, what I do is just fast once I got the quantities worked out (I have to factor in the ounces in the evap milk and coconut milk which goes in instead of all but one cup of cold water and I put 1 envel of unflavored in that).  The flavoring tastes genuine.  I get to craving it, and you do have to wait for it to set well, usually overnight or several hours, but it is very fast to make.  I like it a certain thickness, not knox blocks but a harder set than the directions usually would have you do.

review/summary: Keeps my cats happy and healthy
review/text: I don't know why Science Diet is being referred to as junk food, as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market. A lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be. But regardless, my veterinarian wanted me to put my 2 year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine. After some comparisons, Science Diet Mature Adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food. Both my cats, the younger one and the older (10) are on this food and they seem to enjoy it. They both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them. My younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy :)

review/summary: The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?
review/text: I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Kitty Junk Food
review/text: We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.

Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: All By-Product & Corn -- Don't Waste Your Money!
review/text: I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: ZiwiPeak is made in the US, consistency problems
review/text: Many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in New Zealand. It is now made in the US by Performance Pet Products. I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. I've contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy.

review/summary: Neither cat will touch it :( But dogs go wild...5 Star for Dog Food Treat
review/text: We all know how picky cats can be.  It may be grain free, but food still smells, looks like, and fine details in label indicate "highly processed" with all the extra vitamins & minerals, which I think is the "turnoff" for the kitties. Doesn't say up front, but also contains New Zealand Green Mussell, which I am not sure how that ingredient fits in as I am not from New Zealand, but suspect locals rely on that for nutrients as we do mussells in this country.  They are spoiled on the real thing - minimally processed or raw rabbit, chicken, bird, wild caught salmon.  They will eat canned only if minimally processed.  Another cat food bites the dust but gives the dogs another treat! 1 STAR for not knowing about the New Zealand Mussell & for still being highly processed & therefore unpalatable as food for cats that love rabbit. 5 Star for a dog treat without the added hormones, grains, etc.

I would not purchase this for anything that you were just using honey as a side note and not a enhancer.  Not all additions would perhaps pick up on the flavor distinction to make it worth the extra cost.  It is a delicate delicious flavor.

Not good if you have a sensitive stomach, though, as it is quite acidic.

review/summary: Israel's absolute best Cabernet Franc (and one of world's two best kosher versions)
review/text: Given my public love affair with Cabernet Franc, it will likely not come as a surprise that this is one of my favorite wines from the winery, one I have been following since its first inception in 2003, and one that continuously ends up being one of Israel's best and easily the one I enjoy the most.  The 2008 vintage of this wine was spectacular (see my prior note) and the 2009 vintage is shaping up to be even better with an exceptionally elegant structure and a luscious medley of fruit, wood and green notes.  A rich nose of mostly juicy red fruit including raspberries, cranberries and currants together with the characteristically true green pepper and notes of pine (although Doron takes pains to reduce the overt green notes) follows onto a palate of more fruit, spicy oak, near-sweet cedar, cured tobacco leaf and a mineral streak that is starting to become more prominent in many of Ella Valley's wines.  Amazing now, this wine will continue to develop in the bottle and should stick around for 4-5 more years through 2016.

review/summary: oh what a tasty treat!
review/text: we have polished off the hazelnut and are moving next to the vanilla--along with more hazelnut! the price here is very good--i paid $5.49 per bag at Duane Reade. But, like one of the other reviewers, if I buy 8 here, oh they will be GONE! i'm not one for moderation when it comes to treats that i love.

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: I first tried these cookies while visiting family in Panama.  They were available at the local grocery stores.  When I came back to the U.S. I couldn't find them locally but thank goodness for AMZAZON, I found them and at an affordable price.  I order a carton of eight packages and share them with friends.  They are a delightfully light and fresh tasting treat that soon become nearly addictive.  I have tried some of Loacker's other flavors but the lemon is my all time favorite.  I am tempted to subscribe to them!!

review/summary: Real Nice. Light Fresh Lemon Taste. Mmmmm.
review/text: Here's another of the little items I find in my nearby Fresh and Easy store. It's a British company and they have a lot of imported items. This trip I picked up a bag of Loacker Quadratini Lemon Wafer Cookies. Oh boy, are these good! They disappear real fast. Be ready to apply controls. They're very light and tasty and not overly sweet. The filing has a real light, fresh lemon taste. Real nice. Just right. Just give it a bite and a couple light chews and it's gone and your hand is involuntarily reaching for another one. Mmmmm. Now how am I ever going to keep these around the house? Well, I guess that a lot of others feel the same way. Did you notice that on the 33 reviews, 30 gave it five stars?<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: WARNING: Addictive!  Ohhhhh so good!
review/text: These wafers need to come with a big warning "Addictive"! It takes a lot of self control to stop eating them.  If I did not exercise a lot of self control I would eat a whole bag. Wafers come in a resealable bag, and in theory can last a long time... but in my house the longest one bag lasted was 2 days!<br /><br />I bought the lemon flavor of Loacker's Quadratini wafers. They have a nice strong lemon flavor - nicely tart with a sweet creamy finish, crunchy and pleasant on your tongue. You can chew a wafer to get the pleasant crunch on just hold it in your mouth and let it melt slowly.  Either way you will get an extra ordinary taste experience!<br /><br />I am attaching a photo and two cookies shown from different angles.  Each cookie is 1 inch square. Each consists of 74% lemon cream and 26% wafer.<br /><br />Wafers have no artificial flavors or colorants, and no preservatives.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Unbleached wheat flour, pressed coconut oil, glucose syrup, sugar, whey powder (milk), dextrose, soy flour, barley malt extract, lemon juice powder 2%, salt, leavening agents (sodium hydrogen cargonate, disodium diphosphate), emulsifier soy lecithin, natural vanilla pods, lemon-peel-oil, spices.<br /><br />Loacker wafers are made in Austria and Loackers company had been known for their wafers since 1925.<br /><br />Ohhhh, so good!

review/summary: Delicate Hazelnut Wafer Cookies: Magnificent!
review/text: These are essentially the yummiest, most delicate wafer cookies I've come across. The hazelnut tastes exactly like Nutella, perfect. Each little cookie is 0.5 Weight Watchers points, which is terrific for those of us watching our figures. I usually have four cookies (2 points) with my tea and am VERY satisfied. They taste so decadent. I'm going to try the Lemon next and hopefully will be able to track down the Espresso flavor!

review/summary: Melt in Your Mouth
review/text: I opened the box when I had two friends visiting!  They went home with at least two packages each as they were having weekend guests.  I still have a bunch.  They were a hit. They are so fresh and so satisfying. I just ordered the chocolate ones for next time.  I plan never to be without them.  I want them on the tea table always.  Trust me.  Read the label - they are great.<br /><br />So, I am adding to the review!  The two friends who were here when the cookies arrived,  I had shared some of the cookies with them  raved about the cookies, wanted to know where I got them and are ordering them.  One had a house full of guests and I had given her 2 sacks, knowing she was having Pumpkin Festival guests - she said they all want these cookies.  I think they are all natural products so that helps.  I have the chocolate ones in my shopping cart but am holding off as I am eating too many,  I ate - alone - one sack on the weekend.  I dare not open more this week.  You have to try these.  I am sure I did not dream about them.  They are not too sweet.  I think you can read the ingredients.  Great for people with braces.  Sigh!<br /><br />OKAY, OKAY, OKAY - I AM BACK TO ADD ON . . . I just bought the dark Chocolate - I don't even like dark Chocolate so I chose that as friends will like them for dessert and I won't be tempted (fat chance) to eat them.  I know I will.  These are the best cookies ever and my lemon ones went so fast.  You will love these cookies!

Until my mom brought home this, which is a complete disaster because we both are completly like obsessed with it now even though we only bought like one bag at time (trying to have self-control here) Eventhoughe  me and my mom havent buy these on amazon yet but I just want to tell you guys how AWESOME those afer cookies are!!<br />I mean I have never taste something this creamy and delicate. The dark chocolate flavored totally rocked my world~ and from seeing all the reviews makes me want to try the lemon ones so baddd.

review/summary: Loved the Dark Chocolate; now I want to try the Lemon...
review/text: I ran across the dark chocolate ones in Italy at an Autogrill highway rest area.  There were snacks aplenty, but the picture on the bag + the fact that it had an extra 20% attracted me.  So, I got a 10.58 oz bag!  I find them satisfying after eating just a few.  It seemed like a never-ending bag.  I googled when I got home, hoping to figure out where to buy more, and ended up here.  I'm glad I did because, after reading some other reviews, now I'm anxious to try the lemon ones!

review/summary: Super delectable!
review/text: These little Loacker Quadratinis are delicious - in ANY flavor!!  Some flavors are hard to find (or to nab on Amazon, since they sell so quickly!) but you will never be disappointed by these perfectly bite-sized pieces of chocolate, or lemon, or tiramisu, or (my fave) hazelnut!!  You will be hooked on them!!  The only trouble you will have is knowing WHEN to STOP eating them!!  I LOVE THEM!! And I keep coming back to Amazon for more, as they have the very best price for the Loacker offerings!!

review/summary: Simply the best wafers ever!!!!
review/text: These are the best wafers I have EVER tasted. I have a sweet tooth and traveled the world (so I have tried many sweets) but nothing compares to these wafers.<br />Also there is one other flavour Amazon does not seem to sell and that is the coconut wafers. Absolutely unbelievable taste and this is an understatement. It has the perfect combination of sweetness, flavor, size and once you start eating it you cannot stop.<br /><br />My favorite are Tiramisu, Lemon, Hazelnut and Coconut. The rest are fantastic too but I have my own I like the best. Italian products - cannot improve on perfect.<br /><br />Watch your waist line though  :P

review/summary: love this flavor
review/text: I fell in love with the lemon flavor immediately I put it in my mouth. it's a perfect combination of sour taste with cream and sugar. I always eat chocolate, tiramisu, coffee..flavor, this is the first time I tred lemon, absolutely great. And if you put it in milk with cold cereal together with banana slices, perfect!
