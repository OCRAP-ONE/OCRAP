review/summary: Yum! Best Deal Per Oz and Good Customer Service!
review/text: If you've ever had Tapatio, obviously you'd know it's wonderful.  My boyfriend and I use it so much that it was getting kind of pricey to buy those small bottles at grocery stores for like $4 for a couple ounces!  So, we bought it in bulk!  This was the best deal out there that I could find, even with the shipping included.  Good customer service, too.  The first shipment arrived damaged and they replaced it right away.

review/summary: Great sauce....if you have nothing else.
review/text: Low quality and low flavor hot sauce....not all that hot either.<br /><br />If you need some hot sauce and have nothing else around, then this will do, but that there are so many other choices, this is the worst choice to make. Even regular tobasco sauce is much much better.<br /><br />I can only describe it as being similar to watery taco bell sauce.<br /><br />I would recommend Frontera Hot Sauce, Tobasco, or Cholula Hot sauce over this.

review/summary: Great Flavor with a lot of heat
review/text: This hot sauce is quite spicy, with a nice rich flavor.  It isn't just full of vinegar like Tabasco sauces are.  It is hot but not so hot that you can't taste the full flavor of the peppers.  It has a nice smoky chipotle taste to it.  It is really spicy so it isn't for the faint of heart when it comes to eating hot sauces, but if you like it spicy it is certainly worth the money.

review/summary: Smooth Honey
review/text: This Scotch was a mystery to me; I always thought that Johnnie Walker only came in colors. Turns out, they have this little quiet Scotch called Swing.<br /><br />Swing is a soft, delicate, smooth Scotch. There is a lot of honey flavor along with an incredible smoothness. This Scotch is very easy to drink. There is no smoky flavor at all.<br /><br />So where does it fit in the color scheme of things, someplace close to Gold. The price point is slightly more expensive than Gold. Where Red, Black, Double Black, and Green make a wonderful smoky progression, culminating with Blue, Swing stands almost alone. Its cousin is Gold, but Swing is much more refined and maybe a little bit sweeter.<br /><br />I love this Scotch, and I am a died in the wool smoke fan - Green is one of my favorite every day drinking Scotch. I really dislike Gold, it is too thick and the edges are too sharp and unfinished. Swing hits a very happy medium with those edges smoothed off. There are no really sharp flavors in this Scotch, just a lovely sweet honey flavor.<br /><br />From the Johnnie Walker website, Swing was supposed to be made for sailing ships, to take to the new worlds and sell. The shape of the bottle was supposed to keep it upright in a ship. Frankly, I'm not a big fan of the bottle. The maritime story is nice, but I much prefer Johnnie Walker's square bottle. The sad thing, this looks like a Crown Royal or Pinch bottle, and frankly was the reason I'd never bought it before. Don't judge a book by its cover; the contents are far better than Crown Royal or Pinch.<br /><br />If you like smooth Scotch, this is a winner.<br /><br />The picture for this product makes the bottle look like it has hideous black lines on it. The bottle is really beautiful - clear glass with the amber Scotch inside. There are no black vercrose veins on the bottle.

review/summary: great alternative side dish
review/text: I've always enjoyed couscous, but I never tried the "pearl" version of it until I went to Walt Disney World and ate at an all-u-can eat Moroccan buffet at one of the parks!  It's absolutely delicious!  Most recipes I've seen for Israeli couscous have you adding things like tomatoes or olives, but I bought this pearl couscous from Amazon (Barry Farms) and just cooked it up using some plain chicken broth...amazing!!!  There were no cooking instructions on the back of the bag so be sure to cook it 10-12 minutes using a 1-cup couscous to 2-cup liquid ratio until all the liquid is absorbed.  Or I guess you could try one of the numerous recipes you can find online at various websites ([...], etc.)<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot to mention that my husband was so pleased with the pearl couscous, he asked me to buy a lot more of it off Amazon!  It makes a terrific side dish and it's a nice change from plain veggies or seasoned rice.  Enjoy!

review/summary: The best couscous I have ever had!
review/text: I am a big fan of Cooking Light magazine.  They regularly feature recipes using Israeli Couscous.  I found it once at a local health food store, but it turned out that they had purchased it my mistake.  I have driven 45 miles to the next biggest town to find it - even at specialty stores - and it is still pretty rare in these parts.  I buy several bags from Amazon at a time and keep them stored in rugged plastic containers.  [...]  They have one with cooked chicken and kalamatas that will knock your socks off.

I wish I could afford to get the organic version of this, but for now, this will do great!  I also love that I don't have to lug a 30 lb bag of dog food from my car to the house.

review/summary: These are the BEST gluten free crackers I've every had!!!!
review/text: I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease in July 2009.  I've gone to grocery stores and whole foods markets in Pennsylvania and New York, and out of all the different varieties of gluten free crackers I've tried (and trust me, it's been a LOT!), these are hands down the absolute BEST!  I love them!  Plain, or with sliced cheese or with Tuna or some black beans on top, they are delicious.  I was so happy when I tried them the first time I almost cried.  If you live with celiac disease you know how hard it is to find good tasting alternatives to what you used to eat.  This is a wonderful company for putting out such good food, which also happens to be nutritious.  Thanks Crunchmaster!

review/summary: Not for my taste buds
review/text: I have only found a few gluten free crackers I like, this IS NOT one of them. I purchased these at Sam's Club, much cheaper. These crackers were hard, not crunchy, almost seemed stale. The first bite didn't taste too bad but they left an awful, odd after-taste, similar to burned grain. The texture wasn't too bad, not the usual prepackaged gluten-free grainy texture. My husband went Gluten-Free when I had to, he almost almost anything and he doesn't like them either. We tried them plain, with cream cheese, with cream cheese/olives, in salad, with cheddar cheese, nacho cheese but nothing would conceal the after-taste, in my opinion they were Horrible! I would say it is just my taste buds but...I not 1 of my 5 kids, 4 of which will eat pretty much anything, liked these. We offered them to friends, family, and neighbors but after trying them no one would take them. It could be possible that we purchased a bad batch, there were 2 packages in the box, but I don't think we want to chance buying and wasting another box. After reading some of the other reviews it appears many people love them, I guess you never know unless you try them. We hated to toss them in the trash so we occasionally used them as dog treats, the dogs did like them.

review/text: I know this is a cat treat but my chihuahua that wont eat anything but human food devours this snack. My other chi loves it just as much but she will eat anything. I would advise putting it it a zip lock bag in the fridge but never had any trouble with mold as the other reviewers said. If anyone is familiar with small dogs you have to watch for hypoglycemia. But with these snacks around she gets the protein and calories she needs. She has never had any troubles digesting this snack and has eaten half a pack with ease, she would eat the whole bag if it was up to her.

review/text: I have tried every flavored tea known to mankind that I have access to and by far Walters Bay is the best for flavor AND for value.  Raspberry, Mango, Peach, and Plain iced are all wonderful and 1 pouch will brew 2.5 gallons of tea.  2.5 GALLONS!  I bought the flavor sampler from them and each version yielded the same result.  Yes its a dark brew but so what...for me that translates into my tea dollar stretching much farther than ANY of their competition.  I am not a tea snob by any means and ONLY drink iced versions. Period. So it may be that for the tea snob inclined the flavor, body, bouquet, balance, yadda yadda may disagree with you and if so, so be it. For me, Walters Bay is a perfect and very economical replacement for Paradise Tropical, China Mist, and all other flavored variants.  And for the tea snobs out their, Walters Bay Tea has won multiple awards details of which can be found at their website.

review/text: I bought this same item for $14 at a local pet shop in Hawaii.  Yeah, weird.<br /><br />My 18-yr-old cat has been through Innova, California Natural, Prairie, & Instinct.  She would invariably be tired of her food within a week or two.  With certain flavors of the Prairie she was tired of it from the start; she'd give me that disgusted look after inspecting her lunch.<br /><br />I bought the bag of Addiction kibble the first time I saw it because it was something she hadn't tried yet, & as I was cutting the top of the bag off with scissors my cat actually jumped onto the table & tried to stick her face into the bag to get at it.  It was unprecedented.  She never got tired of this kibble; she was enthusiastic about it until the end of the bag.<br /><br />Clear message there.  =)

review/text: These little bones are my dogs' favorite treat. I buy the 2-3" size for my Shih Tzu and Pomeranian, and while the strips of chicken that are wrapped around the bone are gone within minutes, the rawhide bones last for a good hour or so.  They get really excited whenever I bring out the Vita-Hide bag, and look so happy munching away on their bones.

review/summary: Unmistakable, classic milk chocolate with unique flavor!
review/text: I am a huge milk chocolate conoisseur/fan, sampling some of the best chocolate from around the globe over the years.  I am a huge fan of Lindt (Switzerland), Lacta (Greece), Milka (Switzerland), Perugina (Italy), and many other premium and even expensive brands.  Despite these, I am a huge fan of Hershey's milk chocolate, because of it's unique, signature taste.  Also, Hershey's has not apparently changed or 'watered down' their formula like Nestle's has.  In fact, many chocolate companies have changed to cheaper ingredients to cut costs, such as Nestle's.  Hershey's has seemingly always stuck to their original formula, and it truly rivals the best the world has to offer because of it's unique flavor.  Long live Hershey's milk chocolate!  It rivals some of the world's best!

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/summary: Easily one of the best brands and flavors.
review/text: BIGS is by far the most flavorful sunflower seed brand, especially their Jim Beam BBQ flavored seeds. However, your mouth will be sorry if you continue seeding to even half a BIGS bag. That's where Spitz comes in. They're cheaper than all the commercial sunflower seeds I've tried, come in larger bags, have a good (albeit somewhat weak) flavor, and are super low on sodium. Put these together and you get more seeds for your money and you can eat a whole pack without burning your mouth up.<br /><br />I would highly recommend these to anyone who plans to be eating sunflower seeds for an extended period of time.

review/summary: Sptiz seeds are the Best!
review/text: I consider myself a sunflower seed connoisseur. I've tasted most flavors and brands on the market and I will tell you that Spitz is the best.  They are low is sodium, compared to other brands, and extremely high in flavor. Because the Spitz brand is hard to find in local stores, I order them by the case... sometimes as many as 10 cases at a time.  The smokey bbq is my favorite, but the chili lime and dill pickle are incredible as well.  Once you try Spitz, you'll never eat another brand.  Another great thing about Spitz seeds is that the bag is resealable...no more spilling out the uneaten seeds. I encourage you to try them, you won't regret it.

review/summary: Unpleasant taste, very heavy bread.
review/text: Expected this all-natural sourdough rye bread mix from Germany to be much better.  The packaging is attactive, with instructions that are easy to follow for bread machines and conventional ovens.  You get a bag of the flour, a packet of yeast, and two packets of liquid sourdough starter.  I used my Zojirushi bread machine on the whole wheat setting, which usually works great.  Trial number 1: Made exactly according to package directions, the bread came out like an undercooked doughy rock.  While it did rise during the process, the last rise was minimal.  Usually a 1 1/2 pound loaf bakes 7-8" high in my machine.  This one was barely 4" high, half of what is should be.  The taste was bitter and the herb flavors, including caraway, coriander, and fennel, were unpleasant.  Trial number 2:  I added an egg and an extra packet of yeast, plus 2 tsp of sugar, in an effort to help the bread rise more.  I also baked it for 10 minutes longer in the regular oven after the bread machine finished so it wouldn't be so doughy.  The result was no better than the first. The loaf was very heavy, bitter and taste, not good at all, inedible. Trial number 3:  This time I combined the package of Seitenbacher with half of a standard white bread recipe that works well in my machine (basic white bread: 1 5/8 cup unbleached white flour, 1/2 cup plus 1 T water, 1 T dry milk powder, 2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1 packet of yeast).  I hoped that the combination of a lighter white bread with this dark heavy rye would help.  Well the resulting loaf did rise more, but only to about 7-8".  This is essentially 1 1/2 time the usual recipe, so it should have risen to the top of the pan, 10-11" or more.  It's still very heavy, and the additional sugar did nothing to overpower the strong bitter flavor of this bread.  It did taste a little better with a lot of butter on it, but not enough to really enjoy it.  I had to convince myself I liked it, but I didn't.<br /><br />Perhaps this style of bread is supposed to have a bitter flavor, but it's really unique in a negative way, and unlike any rustic sourdough rye I've ever had.  I'll be feeding my three experimental loaves to the birds.  I do wonder if the Seitenbacher German Farmers Bread without seeds would taste better or not, but it might also has the same herbs.

review/summary: GREAT but much cheaper at grocers
review/text: I live in central Georgia, and Claxton fruitcakes have been a Christmas tradition.  When my daughter was young, they were always "Jesus' birthday cake," eaten for breakfast on Christmas morning.  She is now living in San Jose, CA, and she called me this morning to ask that I bring one with me when I fly out next week.<br /><br />Claxton fruitcakes really are GOOD.  They don't have the icky citron pieces... just the good cherries and pineapple bits, along with nuts and dense, sweet cake.  The flavor and texture is a perfect blend.  And the best part is, they sell for $2.99 at the local grocery stores.  If you know anyone in the southeast, ask them to mail you a couple of these instead of paying these high online prices.

I looked forward to enjoying these as in the past.  The one I opened, was dry....I moistened it with Rum.  Still dry,  I drenched it with rum and, while the cake got gummy, the fruit stayed hard and dry.  There was an abundance of raisins and currents (all hard).  Fruits and citron were hard.  Nuts hard and dry ( small pieces at that).....  Cherries were few...very few.  Slices just crumbled into little wads because the fruit and nuts were so hard the knife wouldn't slice them neatly.  I'd send everything back, but the postage isn't worth the bother.

review/summary: excellent sugar substitute
review/text: Sweet `N Low is my favorite sugar substitute. I like the sweet taste of my coffee with two packets of this mixed in; and I suppose you could use this for recipes as well.<br /><br />Sweet `N Low contains no calories, no fat and no sodium. It has less than 1 gram of sugar which means it has practically no sugar. It has less than 1 gram of carbs which again makes this product a good choice for people who can't use sugar in their diets.<br /><br />Use this product before and expiration date stamped on the outside of the package. You can either keep the individual packets in the thin cardboard box that they come in or you can put a few in a container and leave them on your kitchen counter or your dining room table.<br /><br />Overall, Sweet `N Low may be too sweet for some people; in that case try Splenda or Equal. I personally like a slightly sweeter taste to my coffee or iced tea and therefore I chose Sweet `N Low as my favorite.

Take the time to find truly gluten free Buckwheat Flour from someone else.<br /><br />I've written to Hodgson Mills about their practice, so perhaps one day they will change things.<br /><br />In the meantime, there are companies that produce Buckwheat Flour specifically labeled Gluten Free, and I'll definitely be looking for one of them the next time I visit a gluten-free friendly store.

review/text: We first discovered lemon olive oil on a trip to the Amalfi Coast in Italy.  This olive oil is made the Italian way, not with lemon flavor added, but with the lemons and the olives pressed together.  When I make cod, I season with herbs, brush this oil over the top, then bake for 15 minutes--fabulous!  This oil is worth every cent.

review/summary: Oatmeal Raisin Cookies of Joy
review/text: Frankly, I don't care if food is organic, or non-organic, or natural, or whatever. I like food that tastes good. And while I recognize that cookies aren't really "food", in the sense that they're a desert -- and certainly not something you turn to if you're looking for your basic nutrition, I find these particular cookies to be totally AWESOME. I like my oatmeal raisin cookies soft, and that's what these are. Soft, sweet, chewy, superb. I wouldn't mind if they were a smidgeon cheaper, but I would imagine making them organic adds to the cost -- so I blame you danged hippies with your granola-crunchy desire for kumbaya soul harmony when it comes to the sticker shock. Still, they're good enough they're worth it. They'll probably negatively impact my waistline, but as I'm not a believer in reincarnation, I figure I got one shot at existence. May as well take the time to stop and gorge on the cookies.<br /><br />The delicious, delicious cookies.

review/summary: If you want an old-fashioned, homemade taste in your cookies, Country Choice oatmeal raisin might be your cookie of choice ...
review/text: If you want a cookie that has that homemade, old-fashioned taste, Country Choice organic oatmeal raisin cookies will fit the bill.  They are rather pricey, but you do get what you pay for.  These cookies are individually wrapped and that makes it handy to put them in a lunchbox, backpack, or any portable bag.  They are quite soft so you can't expect them to be in one piece if you pack them with solid items like an apple.<br /><br />These cookies are small at just under 3" in diameter, so don't expect you are getting a box of giant sized cookies.  They are great for people who are trying to watch what they eat or are perfect for small hands.  I'll list the ingredients below for people who have special dietary needs or allergies.  All the nutritional facts for this product are on the company website.<br /><br />NOTE:  These cookies do contain egg, soy and coconut ingredients and are "Manufactured on shared equipment with milk, wheat, peanut and other tree nut containing products."<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Organic Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Organic Sugar, Organic Raisins, Organic Cane Syrup, Water, Organic Whole Grain Oat Flour, Organic High Oleic Sunflower and/or Safflower Oil, Organic Brown Rice Flour, Organic Honey, Organic Coconut, Organic Whole Eggs, Leavening (Baking Soda, Monocalcium Phosphate), Corn Starch, Sea Salt, Organic Vanilla Extract, Soy Lecithin, Guar Gum, Organic Cinnamon

review/text: A cookie a day (or 2, depending on serving size) is one of my few indulgences. I discovered the Country Choice line at my local Wegman's originally. Their prices are good, but I think Amazon has them beat for the Oatmeal Raisin cookies.<br /><br />These cookies are individually wrapped. One cookie is a serving, at about 100 cals.<br /><br />I like that the cookie is soft, and the raisins are soft and still moist.<br /><br />I really like that the ingredients are organic.<br /><br />They're good tasting to me, not too sweet, not too anything. Just right.<br /><br />Along with their Vanilla Wafers, and Trader Joes' Almond Windmill cookies (and lately, their Southern Style Pecan cookies), these are definitely in my Top 5 Cookie list.<br /><br />Give them a try by buying a single box locally ... then come back and get the mega pack from Amazon.

review/summary: Worst. Cookies. EVER.  *****review for Double Fudge Brownie flavor*****
review/text: I actually feel awful giving a bad review to a product manufactured by a company that might be a small, independent operation, but... dang, these are bad.  I checked the label before purchasing them b/c while I am all for the idea of organic, I did not want some crazy gluten-free, vegan, tasteless, saw dust biscuit.  These were neither gluten-free nor vegan, passing the test with real ingredients like whole eggs, flour and real chocolate.  I figured I was in for a treat.  WRONG.  Unfortunately, they are dry (even though they're "soft baked"), and flavorless.  They have that very specific, cardboard, non-flavor that you get with weirdo hippie-food.  (Nothing against weirdo hippies - they're great - it's just that sometimes their packaged food sucks.)<br /><br />Bottom line... if I'm going to indulge, I'd rather eat crappy cookies filed with unpronounceable sludge from some evil multinational.  Truth is, sometimes hydrogenated & high-fructose tastes better.<br /><br />P.S.  Despite the large photo on the large box, the cookies are quite small.  About 30% smaller than pictured.  Not cool.

At 100 calories - its just right.<br />Now, this isn't a meal replacement - it is kind of small so it won't fill you up. But the taste is really good and you can feel good eating it.  Not as sweet as many oatmeal cookies that you find, but you can definitely taste oatmeal and chocolate! I have these on SS.

I really like the soft texture of the cookies, the oatmeal flavor, and the melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness of the plentiful chocolate chips.  In addition, they're made with organic products and they are relatively low in calories (100 for a 23 gram cookie) and saturated fats (only 1 gram per cookie).  My suggestion is to try just one and see if you can resist having another  { : > )

review/text: I have tried going back and forth between cat foods for my kitten, who is almost 1 year old and close to switching to adult food. All around, this is the best one I've tried. I mix it with a wet food to make it a little more easily digestible, but even with this, my cat won't eat a lot of other brands, even the more expensive ones. I guess she's a picky eater. She always chows down on Purina, though, and I also don't have any problems with extreme litter box smells, as I did when experimenting with one other brand. Yikes!

review/summary: Purina Kitten Chow
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I have fed all 5 of my cats this food since they were very young.  It is only recently that my most fragile one developed urinary troubles.  I have done a lot of research on diet since then, and have discovered that there are much better foods out there for cats.  I originally choose this food becuase the ingredients seemed a bit better than other brands at the grocery store and the price was very affordable.  So if that's your goal, this is a pretty decent food choice.  However, in my research I discovered that cats should not be eating grains.  Also, chicken, or meat should be in the first couple ingredients if not the first ingredient.  That being said, it seemed to work fine with the other four cats, I don't why the 5th cat was more sensitive to it, though he did eat it for about 6 months until he developed his problem.  Moral of the story, if you need food, it serves it's purpose.  Though because I am now a bit more health aware, I will no longer be feeding this food to any of my future kittens.  If you do decided to feed this or any other dry food, I would recommend also feeding canned food once or twice a day to add moisture to the diet.  On another note, the subscribe and save is very handy.  Not only is it a bit cheaper, but it saves you the trouble of having to go to the store and buy it.  I wish they had subscribe and save for more items.

review/summary: High quality product I rely upon..thank you, Purina!
review/text: I must agree with the first reviewer, as I've never once seen any feline of any age show anything less than enthusiasm for Purina Kitten Chow. I purchase at least one on these seven pound bags per month, although my youngest are now approaching one year of age. Many people (myself included) avoid commercial cat foods, but I've had some truly great results with Kitten Chow over the years.<br /><br />I don't think of Kitten Chow as "for kittens only". No doubt there are people who will disagree, but I've observed the benefits of feeding to older cats or kittens who are either malnourished, recuperating from a surgical procedure or are outdoor, feral cats who refuse to allow humans to touch them. This is what I bought and fed a young female cat who arrived on my front porch last winter, cold, starving and frightened..and, as I realized about a month later, when she'd gained weight and bone mass, very pregnant. Initially, I hadn't expected this cat to survive, but she thrived.<br /><br />Then I feared that if she succeeded in giving birth to a litter, her kittens might be weak and have a less than optimal chance for growing to adulthood. Wrong again! She got through the birth like a champion and each of her four kittens are healthy and happy (all, including the Mom cat have been spayed or neutered). Her diet and then theirs, until they were weaned: Purina Kitten Chow, a Cat Mother's Milk supplement and chicken or turkey (human) baby food. The Kitten Chow remains as part of their regular diet.<br /><br />The feral outdoor cats benefit from the extra nutrients and fat content. I often wonder how these poor critters survive sub-freezing temperatures and have built a few small shelters to keep them out of the wind, rain and snow that I've no evidence they use (back to the shelter drawing board for me!), but Purina Kitten Chow is food they adore and eat and I'm convinced it has helped these cats survive (and one I was able to humanely trap and have neutered and vaccinated before releasing him back outdoors ~ his definite preference ~ survived the surgery and the winter cold, an attack by another feral and territorial cat and now appears quite healthy).<br /><br />I could be a snob about this as so many people seem to be: if a product is commercial, it isn't trustworthy or truly good..but I've seen a lot of recalls of very expensive high-end guaranteed organic kitten and cat foods and Purina Kitten Chow did not seem to make it to the recall list. When I believe a feline needs even more nutrition than this food provides (a RARE occurrence), I typically resort to DIY recipes where there is no issue with Quality Assurance.<br /><br />Honestly, this food is not only a favorite with cats of all ages, but I believe it is also a lifesaver. It's great that Amazon has made this product available, as it saves me a 50+ mile trip into town and a lot of running around miles of a "Super store" to be able to receive it via USPS at regular intervals. Now that these kittens are *technically* cats, it might seem less than optimal to feed them Kitten Chow. Still, I continue to incorporate it into their diet. The only reason I could imagine NOT to make this food available to your kitten or cat is if they appeared to be overweight..and mine (who live entirely indoors) aren't. They're in terrific shape! They all have exquisitely beautiful and healthy coats, lovely clear eyes & zero GI problems. They prefer the Kitten Chow to Purina's "All Ages" Original Formula and if you feel any concerns you can always mix a percentage of both together as an extra incentive ~ and those of you for whom price is no object: it's good to keep a bag around when your cat refuses to eat the high end Prescription Diet.<br /><br />Again, this is the food of choice IMO for feeding feral outdoor cats..particularly when you cannot afford to buy the really high end food that isn't necessarily any better (and is potentially far worse). In case you're concerned about longetivity: I've had a cat who lived to be nearly twenty years old who was entirely a Purina Kitten and Cat Chow cat who was healthy right to the end of his considerably long (indoor/outdoor..before I had the wisdom to learn that keeping one's cats indoors 24/7 was the kindest, safest way to go) life.

I am withholding one star due to the seasoning packet, that quite frankly,  isn't that great, and very bland. I find that a healthy amount of black pepper, red chili flake, and a few drops of your favorite hot sauce and you're in business.

review/summary: What happened?
review/text: My husband LOVED this coffee when I first ordered it last year. I signed up for regular shipments to arrive so he would never run out. Now all the sudden he says it doesn't have any flavor and tastes old. Not sure if they changed the coffee or his taste buds changed, but had to stop my auto shipment and now I'm back on the hunt for a good dark roast decaf coffee! Darn!

review/summary: Great Find. Bold, rich, non bitter Highly recommended for Keurig owners
review/text: I tried various K cups in order to find the one for my taste. Finally, a friend of mine gave me a pack of this and I used it with EZ cup and EZ filter on Keurig B60 system. 1.5 tablespoon of this finely ground coffee brews a great 8/10 oz cup of rich, bold coffee. This is BOLD but DOES NOT leave bitter taste in your mouth. The seller is quick to ship and has great communication in addition to offering free shipping.

review/summary: Flavorful Change
review/text: If you're looking for a flavorful change from boring bitter coffee this is perfect. Full of smooth body rich flavor from the first sip, this finishes with a great coffee taste without a bitter or "too strong" ending. I enjoy drinking my coffee black without the additives to cover up taste that just isn't that good. I find this is so good tasting that there is no need to add anything. I do not enjoy Starbucks because to get the flavor you also have to take the bitter and too strong with it. I want a full rich flavor without thinking I am drinking bitter espresso. I would recommend trying this Brazilian favorite and see what you are missing. A mere 6 level tablespoons makes a full 12 cup pot in my Cuisinart maker, so this ends up being quite reasonable in cost as well. 5 Star in my book.

review/summary: Broken glass
review/text: Loved the product, but two jars were broken.  Didn't call for refund because I needed it right when it arrived and too lazy to do the work to return.<br /><br />Service was great.  The product got here exactly when I needed it, that's why I gave it a high score.  Might want to pack product a little better, that's why the loss of 1 star.
