review/summary: good
review/text: My dog loves these so I order them occasionally to diversify her treats. NOrmally, I prefer to buy freeze dried beef treats for her - they hold their shape better than the chicken treats. As we get closer to the bottom of the tub,the chicken treats turn into powder and I just sprinkle it over her dry food.

review/summary: Great treat for ferrets
review/text: Of my two ferrets, one cannot be trusted anywhere near this tub by herself. She would consume every last crumb. So, we monitor that and give her a few pieces daily as a great reward for being so adorable. The other ferret is a little finicky and will only eat these periodically.

review/summary: GREAT INCENTIVE TO GET DOGS EATING DRY FOOD!
review/text: As you have probably read, these treats are not like most others.  You cannot overindulge your pup with them because of their richness.  They are very light, but need to be given SPARINGLY.  I use tiny pieces of these as special treats for my "Charly," who adores them. Want to know a trick?  For those of you trying to get your dogs to eat more dry than wet food, take a few of the liver treats and literally crush the suckers into a powder.  It takes a while to do it in your hands, but you can always use anything in the kitchen to help.  Anyhoo....sprinkle just the bit over the dry dog food and VOILA!  I bet your dog will eat up the bowl.  Again, most dogs ADORE these Stewart's liver treats, so the smallest amount sprinkled will do the trick.<br /><br />My friend is a dog/cat rescuer and turned me onto Stewart's - not only because they are really good, but also because they are made in the U.S.A.  That means a lot when it comes to our pet products.<br /><br />My treats came very fast, too!!!  It's much more economical to get the larger tub and it will last a long, long time.  Or consider sharing wwith another dog lover!

My only problem was I ORDERED WHOLE GREEN CHILES.  I do not buy diced due to the skins and the way they stick in my throat.  But in this case it was not so bad an error.

review/text: I wa so disappointed with diced green chiles I bought at the store.  Ortega and Old El Paso have to much liquid and peels. I hate the peels!! I decided to buy from Amazon a brand I had never heard of and take a chance. These are the best! The can is packed - very little liquid if any. Hardly any peels. I have bought this item several times and sometimes the chiles are hotter than other times but I like hot. I refuse to buy store bought. It is a waste of money with the amount of liquid in the can. Who knew with a name like Natural Value these green chiles would be so good!!

review/text: Kara coconut milks (there are so many varieties to choose from) are always creamy, flavorful & rich with just that hint of a sweet coconuty flavor that's just right, and this one too is excellent. And just in case you're like me, always hunting for the ingredients to know what you're buying, they're as follows; Coconut extract (80%), hydrolysed starch, milk protein and tricalcium phosphate (E341). I really love the flavor, cost and convenience of this one, but because of additional additives to this particular one our family will most likely stay with the canned or the vacuum sealed 33 ounce coconut milk. Thanks Kara!

review/summary: Rich deep chocolate bar that's good for you? SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!
review/text: I bought this as the grocery store yesterday and after tasting a square and looking at the calorie count I bought six more bars. That should tell you something.<br /><br />This is like a genie just gave me a wish.<br /><br />I'll start by saying I'm a chocolate snob. I hate bad chocolate. I wont eat a Hershey's kiss or a Hershey bar even if I got a full Christmas stocking full of them free. You can just taste the difference of real creamy cocoa beans and waxy fake chocoate...and in spite of it being good for you, this stuff is decadent.<br /><br />There is no dispute that dark cocoa is heart healthy. The issues is what it's mixed with undoes all good typically. With NewTree even the milk chocolate bars I got were healthy.<br /><br />But here's the scoop on this one...this is an extra large bar. When I read the calorie count (which I read on every label) I was certain I was misreading and it said that was for 2 squares...nope...they consider the whole big bar 2 servings and it has just 160 calories per serving. I SERIOUSLY am satisfied with 2 squares making this 12 servings per container for me and only like 6 calories per serving. Why? It's full of flavor and chocolate so an easy chocolate fix on what's in it and unlike regular chocolate it's mega filling because it has 3X the fiber that regular chocolate does.<br /><br />Better yet? They added flax seeds! Now THIS is how you wanna take in your omega 3s! Who wants a fish oil pill when they can eat dessert?!  It's all natural but gluten-free diners should know it says it has traces of gluten.<br /><br />It is a wonderfully pleasant taste but with 30% less sugar than regular chocolate bars. Seriously, you won't miss it.  In fact, it has 12g of sugar for half the big bar which is less than a protein bar.<br /><br />Perfect to keep in the desk drawer to curb a sweet tooth with no guilt.

review/summary: Yes, I buy the bulk size
review/text: This pasta is hot enough that with an appropriate sauce, such as a Thai peanut sauce, it's hard to stop eating.  I add fried sweet potatoes and garden serranos.  Sort of like a moderately hot salsa, there's an instinct to just keep eating it.  It isn't so hot that it is unpleasant to eat and it doesn't have any chili flavor of its own.<br /><br />You can eat it with a marinara and I do, seasoning it with red pepper flakes.  I'm not a heat freak by any stretch and neither are my dinner guests, but the kick is a welcome alternative and the foundation for many great dishes.  This also goes well with an alfredo or other cream sauce.  I wouldn't recommend it for something Mediterranean styled full of delicate flavors such as capers and olive oil.  Whether it goes well with pesto or is sort of a waste of pesto is debatable.  It's a great base to Indian dishes with goat cheese and lots of fresh vegetables like squashes, zucchini, cauliflower, and so on.<br /><br />Rossi Pasta's website has this same size at the same price.  (I keep trying to order on it, but it makes you recover the password for the account you didn't want to create each time and then still can't process the order.  It might be one of those "it only works with IE" deals that works for most people, but just barely.)<br /><br />As long as I'm griping, I'd like to see a bit better price on this bulk size.  $5/pound is pretty steep for pasta.  The gourmet, hand-made stuff in the unaffiliated corner organic grocery has some delicious locally made pasta in small quantity for the same price per pound.  I do buy that sometimes, but I'm hooked on the unique possibilities of Rossi's Fire Pasta.

review/summary: This caffeine junkie may never drink soda again!
review/text: I have one great vice in life.  Sweet, sweet caffeine.  Oh, how I love it so.  For a man who has a habit of burning the candle at both ends way too often, caffeine is like a breakfast essential (as well as lunch, dinner, and several other times during the day)!  However, coffee really irritates my stomach, and I'm not a big tea fan.  Until I found Element, my only previous answer for this problem was soda (because I am also not exactly the No Doze or Vivarin type - "Look, I'm wide awake!  Boy does my stomach hurt and I've really got to go to the bathroom, but after that, it's go time!").  For those of you soda lovers out there, I understand your struggle.  "Do I drink the diet soda that tastes like crap because of artificial sweetener, and lie to myself that it tastes good just long enough to get that sweet, sweet caffeine into my system?" OR "Do I drink the regular soda and gain 5 pounds...today?!!"  Folks, your search for a solution is over.  I give you Element Caffeinated Water!!  And, if you are super Amazon-savvy like me, you were smart enough to search under caffeinated water and discover Water Joe as well (ha ha).  I'm not going to lie, they taste almost identical - in that they are both water!!  Once you purify/distill water, there can only be so much variance in taste without added flavors, which make it less pure.  However, there is one added difference.  Element includes an extra ingredient in their water, along with the caffeine, to help improve focus and concentration while the caffeine does its job of keeping you awake and amping you up for whatever it is that you are trying to confuse your exhausted body into doing!  I realize that I can get down from my soapbox (podium for those of you who need a younger reference) after complaining about adding things like flavors to water, making it less pure, while meanwhile the caffeine itself is an additive - even if it is a naturally occurring source of caffeine.  However, HELLO!!!  Which part of "caffeine is my one great vice in life" did you not understand?!!

review/text: I was a little skeptical but I have to say, this is a great product. First, like everyone said it tastes like water, no weird after-taste or anything. I'm a regular coffee drinker but during the summer it's not very appealing and you feel a little gross after two or three sodas during the day. This hits the spot for a little caffeine, especially when it's already 85+ by 8 a.m. We had a few sample bottles in NY and wound up getting a case. We gave a few bottles away and everyone's loved it - maybe you'll get some more orders from down south. Nice job!

review/text: This product fulfills all of it's claims. First it hydrates with purified and filtrated water. Next it stimulates with 50 mg of caffeine and lastly, it enhances focus, concentration & cognitive performance with theanine, the secret ingredient in green tea. I have also found that the theanine offsets the upset stomach that one can get when drinking caffeinated water. This is a truly unique product and a great alternative to an afternoon carbonated or milk laden caffeinated beverage. When you order this by the case with free shipping it is also an inexpensive and a healthier alternative to the above listed beverages. The best part, it is a refreshing bottle of water!

review/summary: Good clean tasting water, price point might be a little high.
review/text: I got a few bottles from a friend that ordered it, I freely admit its a good tasting bottle of water. The problem for me is the price point, I am fully aware that its cheaper than most energy drinks of a similar nature, but I don't drink energy drinks solely for the caffeine, there are a host of added flavors and supplements to choose from. This bottled element water while a good tasting alternative is still to put bluntly, a small bottle of water, you could buy a gallon of "decent" tasting water at any local store for less.<br /><br />I like the free shipping, but ultimately the cost is just shifted into the base price of the water. This is something I'd definitively buy in a local store if the price per bottle were able to go down, considering the overhead cost a store would bring I don't see that being overly likely anytime soon. Good product, but i'm not in love with the cost.

In all cases an olive oil pack is superior to water, fish oil, or some cheapo oil (cottonseed, soy, etc). It's really too bad that the Tiny Tots are so hard to find.  They always were the very best,by far.

I can actually eat fish without the bad fat, hooray!  I've tried the plain with olive oil and didn't like that, but I really like these Mediterranean ones.  They are very flavorful and take away the icky fish factor.  I would really recommend this to anyone who wants to try eating, fish but is leery of fishyness that keeps them away.

review/summary: A fine offering from King Oscar
review/text: I've been a fan of Norse Brisling for over 25 years and have enjoyed both King Oscar and Norwegian Prince brands. I once enjoyed the sardine oil packed version but haven't found them since the early nineties, so it's  been olive oil for me lately. The price of brisling was going through the roof over the last five years or so until a couple of years ago. It seems King Oscar moved packing from Norway to Poland to cut costs. From what I've tried, quality didn't suffer one iota.<br /><br />These King Oscar Mediterranean Sardines are delicious. There small for so-called one layer. The way they're packed is more like 1.5 layer. I love them on Red Oval or Wasa Light Rye. The Mediterranean seasoning is unobtrusive but pleasant.

review/summary: Not fishy, good flavor, little saltier than I like
review/text: The fish is good quality - not mushy. The flavor is good; you can see some olives. The only minor gripe I have is that it's saltier than I would like (pretty standard for all canned products) but not so much that I can't eat the 12 pack. I would recommend this product.

review/summary: my hubby can't stop RAVING about these!
review/text: My husband and his two brothers grew up on sardines and truly love them.  Until now, their favorite was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EF3E3G">Crown Prince Crosspacked Brisling Sardines in Olive Oil, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, and they always thought it was funny to visit each others' homes and find the same brand in each pantry.<br /><br />Recently, though, my husband tried these Mediterranean-flavored sardines from a local gourmet store and was hooked.  We were delighted to find them available on Amazon.  We just received our first case, and he's in heaven.<br /><br />Here's his report:<br /><br />-medium sized<br />-single layer<br />-with wonderful flavor from dark olives and herbes de provence<br />-nice compromise b/w full fishy flavor and a slight salad-like taste<br /><br />He'll happily take a can of these to work for lunch (which he eats outside, straight from the can, to spare his colleagues!).  He'll also enjoy serving them over a huge salad, again for lunch at work or even a quick dinner at home.  They're also wonderful as a solid snack, in lieu of the usual salty or sugary kind.  And good over <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJHSPW">Finn Crisp Caraway Thin Crispbread , 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 9)</a> or other favorite crackers, or on rye bread.  VERY healthy, good for you -- can't be beat!<br /><br />If you're a sardine fan, or if you've always wanted to be but were afraid of the fishy taste, try these -- you may be absolutely delighted, as he is.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MDAT2E">King Oscar Mediterranean Sardines,  3.75 Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>  I tried these when my local grocery store cleared them out at a buck apiece!  Loved them and of course they are not to be found in any of the local stores.  I went to the King Oscar website and found the link to Amazon.com and was surprised to find them at a reasonable price.  Signed up for the subscription rate and got my first pack the other day.  So far I have kept the pack in my office and have managed to keep my son out them.  If he discovers them I will have to get him a subscription too!  I have gout and probably shouldn't be eating these but from what I read others have eaten them without raising their uric acid level in spite of the purines in the sardines.  So far no problem.  Oh did I mention these are the best sardines I have found.

review/summary: BEST. POPCORN. EVER.
review/text: I first tried this popcorn when I purchased it from our local Blockbuster store.  It's AMAZING. That's the only place I ever saw it available to buy, then they closed up all our Blockbusters... I was so sad! Then I thought.. oh wait, Amazon might have it! and they do, I was so glad I looked.<br /><br />I'm not even a huge popcorn eater, sometimes I'd buy crunch 'n munch if I was in the mood.  This stuff is unlike anything I've ever tried. and this flavor, zebra, is their best by far - (although I've never tried a flavor I didn't like from these guys!) It's a little pricey, but not for the quality of the product.  Good quality ingredients, not cheapo plastic-tasting chocolate.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND - try one of their samplers and try them all! you'll be hooked like we are!  Excellent to give with gifts too, very cute packaging!

review/summary: confirmation of # of packages
review/text: I really like this popcorn and decided to give them as gifts to friends and family.  Of course upon reading the review I was a little apprehensive.  Bottom line is this order contains ONLY 3 packages (11oz) of Zebra popcorn.  The 11 oz is considered regular size bags.  On the Popcornopolis website you can get 6 regular cones for $46.99.  The buyer should correct his advertisement as they are very confusing and misguiding.  I guess I was hoping it really was 6 packages but partly my fault for not contacting the buyer to make sure I understood what I was buying.

review/summary: Confused about Title of Product
review/text: My parents love this popcorn.<br />The ad is very confusing because it includes the word "3-pack" in the title but not in the description.<br />There are two descriptions for this products and both say 6 packages... yet the title says 3-pack.  What does this mean?  3 packages of 6 packages meaning 18 containers of popcorn?<br />Also why can't it be shipped to APO addresses?  It is the same postage as to US addresses?  Also I've bought this for my parents before and they loved it. (they have an APO address)  They loved the Zebra chocolate kind the most, so this time I bought ONLY the Zebra chocolate type.  I assume it is really 6 packages and am just ignoring the word "3-pack" for now.  I notified Amazon yesterday that the image didn't match the title, but the only way I could do that was to say the Image didn't fit, so they removed the image today - BUT I REALLY THINK THE TITLE doesn't fit and the image was fine. So I just bought this hopefully 6 packages of popcorn - and I had it shipped to APO address and Amazon accepted by credit card - so again I don't understand why they are titled it a 3-pack and why they say they don't ship to APO addresses when they do.

They have sealed it in a cooking bag with all its juices so it can be placed right into the oven easily. You have to make sure to carve it across the grain so the pork will melt in your mouth, and believe me it does. also it will feed a gob of hungry people. This is a real people pleaser that you must try. With the holidays just round the corner I plan to place my gift orders early because they have been known to run out they are so good. And don't forget their hams and other products that are fantastic :)

review/summary: Two thumbs up for those in a hurry!
review/text: Just had to tell you this does taste like normal frosting that you buy in a can from one of these baking companies.  I used it on 80 tiny brownie bites and it was exactly enough.  It has only one tip, but you can still use regular frosting on a cake or cupcakes or brownie bites, then do a little swirl of this on the top.  It comes out much nicer and more finished looking because the concept is like the cans of colored frosting that you make flowers with or write on a cake, so you can control the swirl into a pretty shape.  Then, you can also add little sugars or candy decorations on top and they stick nicely to it.<br /><br />Truthfully, this is expensive and I only bought it because my first dessert plan fell through.  However, for an emergency during holidays it is worth it to have on hand.  I did not try the chocolate yet, but that's next on my list.  I am not sure that this will be a concept that Pillsbury will continue into all the flavors of frosting, but vanilla and chocolate seem good for starters.<br /><br />I recommend this for almost anyone.  If your presentation skills are not the best, this can really help you have a little more pizazz and "pop" to your cakes and desserts.  Enjoy!

review/text: My interest in Dr. Fuhrman led me to this product. I felt compelled to write a review because I feel that another reviewer really should not have taken off any stars for the mere 2 grams of saturated fat. This product contains 1 ingredient, which is almonds.  The other reviewer should read what Dr. Fuhrman has to say about fats from foods such as nuts.<br /><br />As far as the product goes, this is one of the better raw almond butters I have tasted.  Nice texture and flavor, nothing fancy since it only has almonds and nothing else but still very good and naturally mildly sweet (may not seem sweet to those used to eating lots of sugar). Seems a little bit too pricey, especially for not being organic (I would have taken off a star for this but wanted to give a higher rating due to above mentioned review).  However, it is very likely I will purchase this again. It's a nice way to help increase consumption of plant protein.

review/summary: Need magnifying glass to find liver.
review/text: Finally, a canned cat food that the kitties are eating (at least for now, with a few vitamins & minerals. And this brand won't end up in the dog bowls! But I am hard pressed to find the chunks of liver - very skimpy - which is really O.K. because the cats leave what few itty bitty pieces that ARE in the can behind (3 Star for deceptive liver chunks/ 5 Star for chicken breast).  Looks almost as pictured, except for liver chunks.  I also bought the plain chicken from same company & will just go with that and rate a 5-STAR.  If your kitties LOVE cooked liver, you won't find enough in this recipe to satisfy their hunger - unless they eat all of the chicken too, which you probably wouldn't buy if cat didn't like chicken.  I am just so happy to transit the dry food & salty canned chicken addicted cat to a wet food to save on the kidneys. I do have one cat that loves raw liver & chicken, but I like to take a day off from adding vitamins and messing with raw meat (cutting, etc) so this is going to work out, it appears; hopefully for awhile - though one never knows with kitties.  Great today - terrible tomorrow!

We've experimented with all favors of Weruva.  This and Paw Lickin Chicken are their favorites.<br />Our local pet store offers a "buy 3 get the 4th free" deal and a buy-by-the-case discount.

It's not a huge dollar savings, but the fact that it's delivered right to my door adds time and gas savings too.<br />Happy kitties, healthy kitties, time, gas and $ savings makes for happy humans too.

review/text: This is the best canned food I have ever purchased!  My cats love it and race to their dishes with this food.  The food itself appears very fresh and healthy, it is appetizing and even smells good compared to most other canned foods.  I will admit that I thought the picture of the food didn't look too appetizing, but it is the complete opposite when you see the quality of this food.

review/summary: Healthy food
review/text: We have two picky cats - Calie & Dylan - and have tried most of the grain-free foods available. Funky Chunky is the one that they will eat. Dylan chomps it down while Calie is still picky with it, but at least she will eat it where she and her brother won't touch the others.

review/summary: Your cats will love it and it's good for them
review/text: After some health problems with our cats we switched over to a more natural diet.  This was the transitional food.  It is made with quality products no fillers or junk you can get in most other cat foods.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is the price.  Our cast love it and can be picky eaters.  You can't find it in local stores and prime shipping is a great deal.

review/summary: Fully Sattisfies Human/Feline Desires
review/text: My cat loves this stuff, and it even looks appetizing to me (not surprising, since its made in a "human food facility"). No animal byproducts, grain-free, BPA-free packaging, made from Mackerel (a safe and sustainable seafood choice, unlike most Tuna), and reasonably priced (especially the larger 5.5 ounce cans)... What more could you want? Seriously, this is as good a choice for wet cat food as I've seen anywhere.<br /><br />BTW, for dry, I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NEWKU4">Acana Grasslands Grain-Free Dry Cat Food, .88lb (Trial Size)</a>. (Check out the samplers, and look for other flavors and sizes from Acana on Amazon and elsewhere.)

review/text: We adopted a 2 year old / 12 pound Russian Blue male from the shelter 3 months ago. We wanted to start him on the best healthy diet of a wet and dry food regimen we could. We tried many brands of canned food including Blue Wilderness, Tiki Cat and Instinct; all of which left unfavorable results. We then moved on to Weruva and my Blue Boy can't get enough! He especially loves the chicken flavors. He's now a happy active cat with the shiniest coat of fur east of the Mississippi.

review/summary: unbeatable quality
review/text: i was a skeptic of this product when i first met the rep in my pet store a few years back because they'll tell you anything to push a sale. "human grade this", "super-luxe that", and so on. out of curiosity, i picked up a few cans at a different pet store in the area to test it out.<br /><br />my. cat. LOVED. them.<br /><br />every morsel, licked clean from the bowl. this price offered online is an exceptionally good bargain: 36.92 for a 24-can case gives you a deal of just over $1.50 per 5.5 oz can. i've never seen it for less than $1.99 in stores with the average being around $2.50/can. the quality of this product is simply unbeatable, period. the moisture content is great for weight management, urinary tract and dental health. the meat quality is absolutely unbeatable compared to any canned food i've ever seen. the best part is the SMELL - delicious! it smells just like canned soup for people to eat. it doesn't smell anything like cheap, canned cat food... because it isn't.<br /><br />do yourself and your cat a favor. buy this product and lots of it.

review/text: just received my case of this food after reviewing many other types. I wanted something that was organic and healthy for my two cats,instead of taking them to the vet all the time..They absolutely LOVE this food,plenty of juice and meat. One 5.5 oz can feeds them both heartily and they lick the dish clean. I started them on an organic holistic dry food over a month ago and I see a big change in their coats,so shiny and soft. I believe that the added expense should keep them overall much healthier and happy...

review/text: My cat likes Mideast Feast and Asian Fusion. He's not so crazy for the chicken or Marbella Paella, but I think it's more that he doesn't like non-fish and doesn't like shellfish.<br /><br />This stuff might be a bit expensive but I see it this way:<br /><br />With the wet food I used to buy, if I didn't take care and left some in my sink or garbage can for more than a few days, there will be small flies that emerged from it. With all the Weruva stuff, I've left some remnants out in my sink for a week and no flies. I really think the cheaper, more available wet cat food has something wrong with it to be spawning flies so quickly.

review/summary: Best wet food I've ever purchased!
review/text: I have 2 super-picky older cats (13 & 9).  I've tried so many options, but this is the first one where the CLEAN the bowl.  I've tried every flavor of Weruva on them, and the plain chicken is by far their favorite.  They like the other chicken varieties but for some reason there are peas, carrots, and pumpkin in it, all of which they strategically eat around.  They both can't stand fish, so chicken it is!<br /><br />Being meat and gravy in it's almost purest form, it definitely has a positive impact on their health.  Their fur is shinier and softer.  And they seem more happy and playful.<br /><br />I never used to believe a food upgrade could make such a difference, but this certainly did!!

review/summary: Very pleased
review/text: This food is a hit!<br /><br />The cat likes it because it's got chunks of shredded meat in gravy.  He won't eat ground or pate-style foods, so the shredded meat in this one is a winner.<br /><br />I like it because, for one thing, it's grain-free.  To my mind, if you could only pick one quality to shop for, grain-free would be it; carbohydrates - and particularly grains! - are not good for cats.  It's very high in protein, which *is* good for cats.  It contains pumpkin, and while that is a carbohydrate, it's supposed to be good for their tummies.  I'm also pleased that it contains duck meat, since I like to rotate my cat's protein sources to take advantage of their differing nutritional profiles.  And finally, it's got plenty of gravy to help my cat stay hydrated; cats are built to take in much of their fluid from their food sources, so feeding dry food exclusively can dehydrate them (and possibly lead to urinary crystals).<br /><br />True, it's expensive.  Even for higher-end cat foods, it's expensive.  But if you'd ever had a cat develop diabetes because of an improper diet (i.e. dry foods high in carbs and too low in animal-based proteins) - or any other condition brought on by a poor diet - you'd agree that a little expense up front is way cheaper in the long run than treating the health condition.  The fact that I'm still giving it five stars should tell you something.  Not that I don't recommend shopping around for deals!)<br /><br />Give this food a shot.  It's a very healthful choice.

review/text: Paw Lickin' Chicken is a big favorite with my cats. It's amazing stuff. Looks good enough to put on a crossiant!<br /><br />I use it in rotation with other Weruvas and other brands. When I first served this, my cats ate it like little crazies. Having seen the euphoria, I went out and bought more cans of PLC. I served it all the time and suddenly there was no interest. My epic fail. Too much, too often, equals wasted uneaten cans.<br /><br />I place Weruva's Paw Lickin Chicken on reserve, serving it 2X total (breakfast and dinner) per week, due to the high cost hence one less star in my review.

review/text: Seriously, this stuff actually looks like something humans could eat.  When you open the can, it looks and smells like real (canned) food, not pressed and formed mystery meat or worse, meat paste.  Gluten-free, which has helped reduce the amount of cat barf left in random places or hidden behind couches, etc.  We buy two or three varieties at a time and rotate it through so the cats don't get bored with it.  Pricey, but definitely worth it!

review/summary: Only Food the Babies will Eat!
review/text: I first discovered this product at a local pet food store. Bella and Dora, our adopted kittens, were suffering from a respitory cold that they had picked up from the shelter and were not eating any food.<br /><br />The girl at the shop was really cool and introduced us to the Weruva line of food as well as other brands. I was interested to find out that the owners of Weruva are somehow related to the company that produces all the tuna for Subway Sandwiches. I guess the husband/wife team had cats and were dissapointed to find low quality soft food in the market, and asked to find out what it would take to be able to use the same facilities. They found out that as long as they produced human grade food, they could use the facility. Anyways, we bought a whole bunch of flavors to see what they would like, and ultimately this is the only one that they always finish!<br /><br />I like that you can tell that it is fish, and not some mushed up by product. It smells very fishy, so if that makes you sick just be aware!<br /><br />Hope your kitties love it as much as ours do!!!

review/summary: Weruva is top quality and this flavor is *MY* cats' favorite
review/text: I've tried many different vendors and varieties of canned cat food and this is the favorite for *my* cats' (two of them) by a long shot.  *Your* cats may not like it.  Cats are very finicky!<br /><br />My advice to any reader is to learn about quality pet food (take an hour or two on the web, there's plenty of material to read) and then shop for top quality pet food only (Weruva qualifies in my opinion) and try a small sample until you find a set that YOUR cat likes. Rotate here and there for variety... if your cat likes variety, that is.  Both of my cats hate fish, love poultry and pork, and will tolerate other meats such as beef and lamb, and they both like a little variety.<br /><br />I wish I had fed my cats canned or even raw food from early on but I made the mistake of listening to an indoctrinated vet and fed them "prescription grade" Hill's Science Diet kibble which is total crap as I have come to learn from my own research. Like most doctors with humans and the pharmaceutical companies, many vets become distributors for pet food vendors for financial reasons and won't recommend something that doesn't make them money.<br /><br />I now feed my cats this Weruva flavor and a couple of other quality canned cat foods (they don't care for any other Weruva flavor, by the way) plus a couple of quality kibble brands (high protein, grain-free - no corn, wheat, or soy).

Unfortunately the price has gone up twice since I started buying it. It used to be $32/case, then it went to $35/case, now it's at $37/case.  That's a 15% increase over the past six months.  However, shipping is free, and I order 4 or 5 cases at a time.  They arrive promptly, and I never run out.

review/summary: Our favorite of the premium cat foods
review/text: After researching cat food, we tried quite a few brands and flavors (Merrick, Nature's Variety, Wellness) before settling on this one.<br /><br />What I like about Weruva Chicken is the strip texture instead of paste/pate, and also the very low fat content. While it's ok for cats to eat fat, they get enough from their EVO dry food, so for their wet I prefer low fat and high protein.<br /><br />I hesitate to say our cats love it, cause if I switch to something else for 2 weeks, then back to Weruva Chicken, they forget that they like it. They seem to need 2-3 days of tough love to adjust to any food, even one they previously liked.<br /><br />I wish it was made in USA instead of Thailand, so it's not perfect.<br /><br />It's only about 160 cal/can, but this is due to very low fat, which other premium catfood makers use to boost their caloric content.

review/text: My cats are VERY, and I mean VERY picky.  This is the only food that they will all eat (there are 4 furry critics in the house).  When you open the can, you think, "Hey, this is actual chicken.  I'd eat this!"  It isn't cheap, but this is the best price I have found.  16 paws up!

review/summary: Weruva Mideast Feast-Great buy & Product
review/text: All of my cats love this grain-free cat food! It not only a great product, but the value through Amazon can't be beat. Even if I buy it locally, I still pay more per can and that doesn't include the gas to get there and back. Love having it delivered to my door and with the super saver shipping the price and convenience is a super saver deal!!

review/summary: Mack and Jack review
review/text: My super-picky, unbelievably finicky cat who is not a big eater and has refused so many different kinds of food LOVES the Mack and Jack and the Meow Luau.  It has been so frustrating to get her to eat something, much less actually like it -- with this food she hears the can open and comes and cries for it.  She didn't like the chicken and liver (Nine Livers), but I am sure that flavor is good, too, she is just ridiculously picky.  I gave the chicken and liver to a friend and her two cats loved it.  Thanks for making a food that this cat will actually eat!

review/summary: Second Runner up for my cats!
review/text: My cats seem to thoroughly enjoy this canned food, second only to Weruva's chicken and gravy.  If your cats love 'gravy' based cat foods, chances are they will Love this, as my four do (yes, All Four love it, which is RaRe!).  They even eat the peas and corn in it! Makes me feel good that it seems to be a good company and good for them.

review/summary: Expensive But Excellent
review/text: My three cats love this and two are rather finicky. They eat every crumb, so there is no waste. It looks like real chicken and smells good too. It is a nice treat for the cats.

review/summary: Great cat food
review/text: My cat has had health issues in the past and the vet recommended "wet" cat food and specifically this brand.  There are no additives or fillers.  My cat has been eating this for years, various flavors, and always "cleans her plate."  The price on Amazon is also the best I have found.  This brand is not available in the large pet chain stores, only upscale pet shops carry it.  So I was pleased to find it available on Amazon.

review/summary: good food for cats
review/text: seems like both of my cats like this food.  liver pieces are sometimes a bit too big for the cats but once I crush them with a spoon, my cats rush back and finish up.

review/summary: great for non-chunk lovers!
review/text: The key to choosing a successful wet food is obvious--knowing what your kitty likes. Over time I learned that my cats like non-chunky wet food. I tried the Weruva chicken flavor, which has grainy chicken pieces. They didn't hate it but didn't go crazy over it either. Then I tried the Polynesian BBQ which has a lot of chunks so that didn't work out either. Then I saw the picture of the Mediterranean Harvest and knew that would be the magic dish. And it was! My cats absolutely love this flavor! I am so happy I finally found something both of my cats love to eat everyday.

review/summary: Even very finicky cats eat it!
review/text: I have three very picky cats who quickly get bored with the same old food. As a result, I am constantly on the lookout for different varieties of cat food that they will eat. Forget about any of the veterinarian supplied cat foods. My cats' response to those cat foods is consistently, "you must be kidding!". The weruva chicken cat food was very well received and gobbled down. But please remember, in the world of cats, variety is the answer! I rotate the foods I feed my cats each day. Just like people, cats do not like eating the same thing day in and day out, and don't hesitate to let you know their dissatisfaction.
