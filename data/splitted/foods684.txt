review/text: My dog loves Greenies. They clean her teeth wonderful and is a great snack for her.  I have a very small dog so we cut them in half so they'll last longer.  I was pleased when we found them on Amazon at the price they sell them plus free shipping.  I love Amazon.

review/summary: My dogs love Greenies
review/text: Greyhounds notoriously have bad breath.  I first bought Greenies years ago when my first greyhound, Sophie, was alive.  She very much enjoyed these treats and her breath improved, at least a little.  Several dogs later, I was excited to bring a box of Greenies back to Mexico to give to my two dogs, Etheldreda - a greyhound, and Sadie - a greyhound mix.  I'm sorry that I can't find them in Mexico and I hate to ration out the Greenies because of the short supply.  Greenies are expensive, but they do help with the dogs' bad breath.  And my dogs love Greenies.

review/text: I love greenies as a treat for my American Staffy.  She has never gotten sick after eating these treats.  They clean her teeth and keep her breath fresh.  Unfortunately they are very expensive and even at a discounted price, at $1+ per treat, it is quite pricey.  I may look at comporable brands that are less costly, since she eats any type of treat thrown her way.  I am lucky that she is not picky.

review/summary: Bonkers over greenies!
review/text: We had a dog for nearly 16 years, who had terrible teeth and foul breath, and ended up needing surgery to remove 19 teeth.  She had infections under the teeth into the bone beneath.  She ended up with kidney disease and we lost her several months ago.  We now have a 1 year old pit/lab mix, Daisy, who will not let us brush her teeth, and I am determined to keep her teeth healthy.  Daisy gets one regular greenie (she weighs 57#) after her evening meal.  Daisy goes bonkers when I open the package, dancing all around the kitchen.  She loves them so much. Daisy gulps down her food, but the texture of the greenies forces her to take her time when she eats them.  So far her breath is not even noticeable, and her teeth are pearly white.  Also, I never give her wet food, which sticks to her teeth.  And, she chews on nylabones throughout the day.  Buying this through amazon.com saves me at least $10, so I am happy to get this online.  The packages always arrive on time and in good shape.  When the weather was very hot and humid here, I did get one box where some of the greenies were stuck together, but the individual greenies were still in good shape.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Not for my dog
review/text: The product does seem to work. If my dog has had a few of these over the course of a few days, her breath is noticably fresher. However, I walk her every single day, and she usually has to use the bathroom around this time. I do not give her Greenies daily, but I have noticed that every time I do give her one in the morning, her bowel movements are not formed well and very loose during her afternoon walk. This could well be a reaction in just my dog and not for others, but I would rather err on the side of caution. These just don't seem to digest well for my pup, so I will not be buying another bag. However, I cannot completely slam this product, as it did help her breath somewhat.<br /><br />If it matters, my dog is a 5 year old long-haired Black Cream Daschund. She hovers between 12 and 12 1/2 lbs.

review/text: My dogs bark at me every morning until they get their Greenie treat. They are addicted to them. I have 3 dogs so it is a bit pricey but that is why I order from Amazon so that I can keep up with their addiction! We use two different sizes of Greenies and the teenie size is good but then they want more than one. If I give them the size larger then I can get away with only one treat per day. I do not know what they put in these but my dogs are crazy for them.

review/text: I've tried to find a "dental" treat to feed my 2 year old Yellow Lab for the past 6 months. None of the recommended chews nor treats did the trick, she plain refused them upon first sniff. I took a chance on the greenies based on some quick and dirty research, and am sure glad I did. She absolutely devours them in no time flat. For a somewhat picky eater (an extreme rarity in the world of Labs) these proved a fantastic purchase.

review/summary: Gold standard...Years of research on my part...
review/text: When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my "baby" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE "health" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept "treating" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and "cured" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it.

review/summary: No meat by-products, good and safe, Turkey & Chicken Dog Food
review/text: Everyone knows about tainted pet food from China.<br /><br />Newman's Own is a branding that I can trust, and this one is a real winner.  Newman's is what I would make if I were making it for my own family, as in you can trust that it is great tasting, good for you and safe to eat.  I'm very pleased that the Newman's line was extended from people food to pet food.<br /><br />When it comes to moist dog food every single choice on the market has meat by-products except Newman's Own.  My 3-month old puppy goes crazy for this, as well as for the Chicken-only Newman's canned dog food variety.  In fairness he would probably go crazy over meat by-products too.  While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog.<br /><br />One other finding:  When you open almost any moist dog food you smell "dog food".  When you open Newman's Chicken or Chicken & Turkey you smell meat.  It actually smells good.  Imagine that.

review/summary: My little yorkie is 14 years old and developed digestive problems a couple of years ago
review/text: My vet gave him a prescription diet which helped him tremendously but he HATED it and wouldn't eat it until he just couldn't stand being hungry any more.  With my vet's okay, I started mixing just a little of other types of canned food with the prescription but after a few days I could see he wasn't feeling well and his problems began to return.  Finally, I picked up a can of Newman's organic and mixed that with his prescription.  Not only did he like it, he was fine!  I can't give him this alone - he still must have the prescription - but as long as it is at least half the prescription mixed in, he can eat it every day and he is fine!  I was so happy!  And so was my little dog!

review/summary: Certified organic liver for my dog! I'm very glad this product is on the market.
review/text: UPDATE:<br />The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great.<br /><br />Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution:<br /><br />I have been buying the "Organic Liver for Dogs" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Amazon. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product.<br /><br />I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Amazon are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets.<br /><br />As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally).<br /><br />UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me.<br /><br />I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars.<br />I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well.<br />I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars.<br />Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars.

review/summary: Must have been a contaminated batch
review/text: We bought a case of 12 12 oz cans back in April. Just now opened the first can. Wow. Consistency of vomit, grayish tinge, and a vile odor. Opened a second can -- exactly the same. No way were we going to feed it to our dog. Something was clearly wrong.<br /><br />We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase.  Guessing there must have been a production run that resulted in contaminated product. We've reported the issue to both Newman's Own and the FDA.

review/text: My Pomeranian has a very sensitive digestive system and I could never find a food that I knew would provide him both great nutrition, taste and no allergic reaction.  Until this canned food ----- that is.  He loves it and it is made so well.  You can tell there are no fillers in it by the appearance and texture.  In fact, when you read the ingredients there is only Turkey Brown Rice and Vitamins.  I encourage anyone who is thinking about ordering this food to give it a try.  Your pooch will be glad you did.

review/summary: The Organic Beef Canned is Inconsistent....
review/text: I've been buying the Newman's Own Canned Organic BEEF for my 9 year old Diabetic Rottweiler to add more protein to her diet since she has been losing weight since her diagnosis 3 years ago.  During the last 6 months that I've been buying it, the consistency of the canned food has been all over the place.  Sometimes it's quite firm and I really have to dig in with the spoon to remove it, sometimes it's a good average firmness, and other times it's extremely mushy.<br /><br />Most recently, the last 2-3 12-packs I've purchased from Amazon or Whole Foods (at different times, not from same lot) have been so soupy that I could pour it out of the can and onto her special diet which is Honest Kitchen Embark.  In the bottom of the can, half the time there has been a thick gelatinous layer and the rest of the time, it is a yellow liquid layer instead so it's pretty gross.  I've been shaking the cans before I open them to mix it up before I pour it out.<br /><br />I've decided not to purchase the Canned Organic Beef any longer.  My dog has been having loose stools lately and I think it's from the soupy canned food.<br /><br />I did buy some of the Newman's Own 100% Liver Canned at Whole Foods and the consistency was very good so I'm going to try ordering this one from Amazon next time instead.  I hope the Liver Canned will remain the right firmness and consistency because I'd rather give my dog all meat without veggies or grain carbs that will affect her sugar levels.  She gets some of those things in the Embark already.<br /><br />Not sure if anyone else has had this problem with the Beef Canned but based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend this particular type of Newman's Own canned.  I can't speak for their other canned food items.

review/summary: Newman's Own pet food
review/text: I have an extremely fussy little Shih Tzu who won't eat dog food.  I discovered she will eat Newman's Own Turkey and Chicken formula of which I found 2 cans at a pet store.  After searching on line for a better supplier I discovered Amazon not only carries the food but would send me a case a month on an on-going basis.  The price is the best I found and I even get free shipping.  Every month I get an email allowng me to opt out of that month's supply if I wish.  I am happy and my dog is very happy.  I strongly recommend checking out Amazon's pet food.

review/text: After tiring of making my dog's food from scratch I looked for an all natural product.  Everything on the ingredients label of this canned food is recognizable as real food; no "powdered protein" or other questionable substances.  My dog loves it but to be honest I have to tell you that she practically inhales anything that she thinks might be food. I have the reassurance that this product won't hurt her.  The turkey and brown rice from Newman's Own is also excellent.

review/summary: Diarrhea
review/text: My rescued GSD loves this Newman's Own; however, every time I feed this to her, every time she gets diarrhea. The first time I took her to a vet and after a few days of prescribed diet and med she got back normal. So I resumed her normal diet (this Newman's Own). Soon her diarrhea started to come back. I took no chance and immediately switched to home made boiled chicken and steam rice. After a few days her stools got much better. I gave this Newman's Own a last chance and... I just finished cleaning up my carpet.<br /><br />I have no idea of why there are so many good reviews. Is my dog just happened to be sensitive to this or I got a bad batch?

review/summary: Newman's Own for Puppies/Dogs Canned Food
review/text: I love this dog food. I eat very well myself, being a vegetarian for over 20 years and try to eat organically as much as possible. I did a great deal of research on commercial dog foods and I was disgusted when I discovered the amount of chemicals and pesticides they contained. I tried my puppy on many different natural dog foods and she would have gas and the runs with every type, but Newman's Own.  So I am back to my first choice since she never had negative effects with it. Unfortunately it was a little hard to find locally, but now I can order it through Amazon and get it delivered every month. Thanks Newman's Own and thanks Amazon for making my puppy and I very happy :)

review/summary: This one is an obvious winner at our house - for my lab mix!
review/text: I offered my lab mix his new DRY dog food yesterday. He refused it. It was one of the Newman's Own dry dog food. No matter what I did, telling him it was a treat, holding some of it in my hand, breaking some of the in two so he might get a bit of aroma from it, nothing worked!<br /><br />Then I read one of the previous reviews that talked about a dog or dogs having the same reaction until they mixed it with the canned food.<br /><br />I had also bought some of the canned food for my large, slow-eating, finicky eater, so I decided to try adding some of it to the dry food. I opened up the can, noticed that he was standing by me all of a sudden, mixed it in with the dry food, and gave it to him.<br /><br />Next thing I knew, the bowl was empty. But then I heard him licking the bowl, the bowl being drug all over the utility room floor!<br /><br />Now, a few minutes later, he is telling me in no uncertain terms, that he wants MORE!  That is an unusual reaction for him. He doesn't get more right now because he had quite a bit.<br /><br />I'm grinning all over because this worked out so well for him. He's an older dog with somewhat fragile teeth, and I'm glad he's happy.<br /><br />EDITED the next morning to say that he ate way too much and kept me awake all night because he needed to go out. I'll have to use better judgement for him than he is obviously able to use for himself regarding portion control. I should have added only enough of the canned food to give the dry food the taste he wanted. The whole can was WAY TOO MUCH for his system when combined with the amount of dry food he ate with it. Portion Control. I will have to keep reminding him, or in this case, I will have to make those decisions for him. He would never know when to stop if I left it up to him. EDITED weeks later to say that PORTION CONTROL has worked well. He really loves these little cans, better than treats, and he loves treats!

review/summary: Newman's Canned Chicken & Brown Rice
review/text: I have an 8 year old Morkie who has been sick all of her life with Pancreatitis, Kidney and Thyroid issues, pre-diabetic status, ear and fungal infections, allergies, various tumors, and the list goes on and on. Recently, she had two severe cases of Hemorragic Gastro Interitis within a month's time, and I almost lost her...twice. My vet and I had run out of ideas to try; nothing seemed to be working for any length of time; hospitalization, IV's, all kinds of meds, etc. and I was desperate! I even stayed home from work with her because I was sure she was not going to make it through that day. It was horible, but I didn't give up even though family members hinted around the suggestion of putting her down. After researching everything I could think of, I stumbled on the thought that maybe her diet was the culprit. I began to search for a food that would fit all the criteria for all of her problems, and found Newman's Chicken & brown rice formula. She's been on it for two month's now, and ALL her symptoms are GONE! Bloodwork-GOOD, Kidney Function-GOOD, Thyroid-GOOD, Allergies-GONE. I cannot believe she's back to her old self and acts like a puppy again. I still give her meds for her Pancreatitis, but that's all! I contribute it all to her food, it saved her life, and all is well for the first time ever! Please, please look at what you feed your pets! I have found that very few commercially prepared foods meet the standards they brag about. Newman's definetely does! Thank you for helping me save my baby girl!!!!!

review/summary: All beef wonderful
review/text: My pug was having skin problems and after 6 months a vet tech mentioned it might be chicken and corn that is giving her problems. So I began looking for something else that was organic and was pleased to find the beef and liver from Newman's Own. The liver was not her favorite and was a little strong smelling for this vegetarian, but the beef was great. She loves it, I steam some veggies and mix them in, then put a dry food on top and she scarfs it down. I do wish Newman's would put out an organic beef treat and a dry food that does not have chicken and corn but am very happy with the beef.

review/text: After reading the ingredients (and being familiar with Paul Newman's great-tasting salad dressings), I was excited about feeding this dog food to my older rescue doberman.<br /><br />I was surprised when I opened the first can because it truly looked like it had been eaten and passed through another dog's intestines.  Sorry to be so graphic but that's the truth.  It's hard to give my dog food that I dont even want to touch.  She loved the taste, though, and that was the important thing.<br /><br />That night, however, my poor dog was in agony and had black, watery diarrhea all over the house.  Twenty-four hours later she still wasnt feeling well.  I gave her Imodium and considered taking her to the vet.<br /><br />I'm happy for those dogs that like this food and dont suffer any side-effects.  I wish my dog were one of them.

Not only does my dog love it, but he does not have problems with his bowels (like he does on other canned 'wet' dog foods). His stools are still solid (although softer) and I can mix the food with water, since my dog is in need of more water in his diet. I love the product, although much pricier than other canned food, but well worth it. No problems whatsoever.

review/summary: excellent, healthy dogfood
review/text: I was looking to change my dog's canned food as he is getting on in years and I wanted a more nurtitious healthy brand than what I was currently using. My dog loves this food and eats it heartily. I feel better knowing he is eating an organic food from a company I trust...I would recommend it highly. I also signed up to receive automatic delivery which saves money. With that discount this is the least expensive pricing I have been able to find.

review/summary: Great Ingredients
review/text: I have been cooking for my dog since before the pet food scare, that gets to be too much at times when you have other things to do or aren't feeling well, I have been feeding the dry Newmans for 3 years but have a spoiled cocker who has to have a little 'something' in with her dry.....this canned food drives her crazy, she just loves it, must be the whitefish in. She gets a teaspoon or so in with her dry & cleans the bowl...Amazons price beats that big box store when you use subscribe & save.

review/summary: my dogs love this food!
review/text: First, I feed my dogs fresh raw food I make into patties and frez, each morning they eat one frozen,and I give them Fish oil, Garlic and Klamath shores Blue Green Algae caps. Then at night I give Newmans Chicken can food and mix in their Probiotic Miracle & Enzymes and Plaque off. Then they always have their dry food (Taste of the wild, grain free)anytime they are still hungery.<br /><br /> My 2 big dogs are very healthy at 8 years old, hardly get fleas anymore, I don't use chemical flea or heartwormer products anymore, as one dog had a bad reaction to them and lost most of his hair and had hot spots for two years. Then nat. path vet said my other vet should not have given him the yearly vacinations,which also caused the problems. He went on a 10 week detox after that.)<br /><br />For the alternative heartwormer I do 1 week each mo. I give my dogs Natures sunshine Artemisia Combination 2 in the morning, 1 at night with 1 BlackWalnut. then 2 times that week I will give them 1 HS2. I give these about 20 min. before I give them morning food. Then at night before bed. My dogs weights are 100 and 70. The dog that had allergey, I also would give him first thing in the morning, before eating, Transfer factor, or colostrum, also everyother day a kelp tablet, which I think helped the hair grow back in. I used emu oil with lavender oil and tea tree oil mixed in, on the hot spots. Also for the ears, I used Zymox, OTIC Enzymatic Solution. it worked great.<br /><br />Hope this info helps someone.

review/text: I did not post this under packaging review, because the order arrived fully sealed, no markings or damage to the outside box, but 8 out of the 12 cans were severly dented, so I had to assume they had been packaged that way.  They were even hard to open with the can opener.  I will still get my subscribed monthly order, but if it happens again I will probably cancel it.  I have no problems with the quality of the product, just very dissatisfied with the way it was mailed.

review/summary: All flavors repeatedly make my dog terribly sick
review/text: At first, I thought my toy schnauzer had gotten into something that made her very sick but I took her off the Newman's Own anyway just to be safe (a decision made by my vet and I after I took her into the ER that night). I decided to try again a few days ago because it appears to be an excellent food (ingredient-wise) and we hadn't pinpointed the specific problem but, yet again, it wasn't even an hour before she was horribly sick and the effects of one feeding have lasted for days (Thank God I have medication left over from our last trip! I'm trying to avoid another vet visit but we're not in the clear yet). Even the stray cats on the block won't touch it and they pretty much eat anything. Definitely won't be trying it again.

review/summary: We Both Love It
review/text: My Husky/Samoyed mix, The Lovely Marie, adores this food. As soon as I open a can, she starts dancing in circles. I think she especially loves the smell of it, although that occasionally puts me off a bit because it does contain fish. Some cans are stinkier than others, but it's all perfume to Marie's nose. She gobbles it up. I do vary her diet to include some grain-free products, but this is the food she gets most excited about.<br /><br />I love it because I trust this company, and I believe that Newman's Own products are of high quality. (I hope I'm right.) I also like their mission to bring good green and fair trade products to the market, and to use their profits to support charitable causes. Bottom line: I feel confident that I am giving my girl something wholesome and good.<br /><br />I stock up on this food because the chicken they put in it is "human grade." I hope the fish is "human grade," too, because I have several cases of this in my garage. I'm thinking that when the "Big One" (earthquake) hits here in California, I'll just break out a case of this food and Marie and I can both survive on it until help arrives.

review/summary: My Yorkies love this stuff!
review/text: After researching the ingredients on my dogs' old dog food (Beneful & Cesars),I wanted to get my pups on some healthier food and I also did not want to break the bank doing so. This turned out to be a great alternative that met all my nutritional and financial requirements I had set forth. For a well rounded nutritional meal, I mix the following <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK339Y">Newman's Own Organics Chicken & Brown Rice Formula for Dogs, 12.7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PMDYZA">Newman's Own Organics 100% Organic Liver for Dogs, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK33C6">Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 7-Pound Bag</a>. The dogs really go nuts for this stuff and seem to enjoy it. It appears to me that the dogs have more energy and are in an overall better mood. One of Yorkies had a licking issue and that behavior has decreased dramatically since I made the switch to Newman's. It keeps their stool very solid as well. Overall this a great, nutritional meal at a good price......5 STARS!

review/summary: Turkey and Chicken Formula smells like fish
review/text: Unless you read the fine print, you won't know that "Turkey & Chicken Formula" actually contains turkey, chicken AND whitefish.  Upon opening a can, you immediately get a hint of something fishy--perhaps this is why others have reported the food as "contaminated".  After just a single 5.5 oz can, my dog had a serious case of fish breath and by the next day was occasionally passing fishy-smelling gas.  Don't get me wrong---my dog loved this food, and I have read enough reviews to be satisfied that it's very good quality.  I have no doubt he would love to gobble down more of this (and I've got another 23 cans to get through), but I don't think my family will appreciate more of the fishy smell.

review/summary: Too Rich for my dogs
review/text: I think this is a very good food but as little as I fed daily (about 1 tablespoon) to my dobie and Dogue de Bordeaux, they both had terrible gas and then went into diarrhea, making several trips outside in a panic more than 5x's a night. They were kind enuf to wake me up! I can use it a couple of times a week and that is it. I think if you buy the Newmans's chicken/rice organic canned and the plain beef and mix them up once in a while it would be better, but feeding the "organ" meat daily is a mistake. Maybe your dog will be fine with it, but be careful. My little shih tzu had no problems, but just like the BARF diet they generally only feed organ meats a few x's a week and maybe this was my mistake. So personally I feel it is a good food, just be careful as it is much richer than most any other canned food you will feed and a tablespoon goes a long way!

review/summary: My picky eaters love it!
review/text: I have two Yorkies that are very picky eaters.  After a period of 2-3 days up to 2-3 weeks they will decide they don't like the food I am giving them and just stop eating.  I went through a real struggle when one of them got a stomach bug and got real sick with vomiting and diarrhea.  I started cooking fresh turkey with brown rice and his stomach healed up in no time.  But them I couldn't get them back onto dog food!!  I found the Newman's Organic Turkey and Brown Rice formula and they LOVE it.  I still give them a good quality dry food for little snack times.  However, they usually wait for their turkey and rice and gobble it up.  They have lots of energy and for the last two months have not gotten tired of the food.  I think we have found a keeper!

review/summary: Good food but...
review/text: I do think this is a good food.  However, it is just too mushy to serve alone.  I give the feline version to my cats and they love it, but cats don't mind a softer food.  We give our little poodle canned food for the low carbs and since our cats love Newmans we thought we would try it for him.  First I got it in the big cans, which is enough for 2 days for Joey and I was OK with that.  The first can I used was OK, not great, but OK when I opened the can and gave him the top 3 ounces.  His dinner with the second 3 ounces wasn't as good.  Next day it was even mushier in the second half of the can.  I liked the food though and he did well on it so I ordered the smaller cans to see if there would be a difference there.  I used half of a can this morning for his breakfast and it was OK, but not stiff enough to make it easy for me to chop up and him to eat.  I am going to use this food as a mixer with his Tiki dog food until it is used up and then I don't think I will buy it again.  I don't get it either because it is the same 78% moisture as his California Natural and By Nature dog food but it just doesn't hold up.  I will continue to give it to my cats in their rotation, but little Joey will be sticking to his other good foods.

review/summary: My dogs love this stuff from Uruguay
review/text: OK, I admit, if this hadn't been offered during an Amazon lightning deal I would not have bought it due to the high price.  However, this morning I opened a can to use for one of my dog's medicines.  Each of our three dogs got one-third of a can.<br /><br />And oh my, all three woofed it down and waited for more.  Even the cat chimed in and wanted some.  My dogs don't get this excited over canned Pedigree, which is what I usually feed them as a supplementary food source.<br /><br />Although the pureed liver comes out of the can looking and feeling like something that comes out of the back end of a dog, it doesn't smell offensive.  I'm just not used to these more organic ingredients:  liver, beef broth, minerals and vitamins.  This is definitely something I will buy more often for special meals.<br /><br />Interestingly, this product comes from Uruguay.

review/text: I bought a case just to try out on my wiener dog, Oscar.  He has lost weight.  Now he is much more energetic and can jump higher which means he can get into more trouble.  Before going up stairs was slow and sometimes I had to wait. Now he is the first up the stairs just like the old days.  Keeping weight off of Dachshunds is very important for their back.  It costs a little more but I think I will make it up in vet bills and also have my buddy around for a longer period.<br />Doesn't have that dog food smell and you can actually see the ingredients.

review/summary: Glad we tried, has made a difference
review/text: My family rescued a pug mix from a shelter a couple months ago.  We used the puppy food they gave us and then matched the brand at our local store later.  A couple months went by, wouldn't say our dog didn't like her cheap dog food, but she did develop demodex and a whole new world about dogs and health opened up to us.  Bottom line, we were feeding her, but our vet compared it to us eating spaghettios every day for every meal for life.<br /><br />Demodex is not contagious but inherited and a skin disorder we had to treat.  We talked to our vet about her immune system and how we would want to keep her as healthy as possible during treatment and after.  While he didn't really recommend any particular brand, he did encourage us to educate ourselves about what's out there.<br /><br />After some research and with the idea that we buy Newman's Own brand foods for our human selves, we ordered the dry kibble and mixed it with the active dog and puppy formula canned food they make as well.  Our dog does love this food, and clearly prefers the canned to the her old cheap foil top square packages we'd pick up each grocery visit.  We have noticed that her fur, while always been soft, has become thick and buttery soft when you pet her.<br /><br />I know the vet warned us that the treatment might have adverse effects, but she has been fine.  I credit a healthier diet for getting her through this.  And it clearly has done wonders for her skin and coat.  Added bonus, the food actually smells good with minimal odor as opposed to the cheapy stuff which made me gaggy.

review/summary: nothing but the best
review/text: I feed my dog nothing but Newman's products.  Before I got her from a bunch of college kids she had subsisted on cheap dog food and cheap fast food.  Did she wolf down the Newman's the first time I gave it to her? No.  Just like us, it took time to retrain her palate and appreciate the lack of salt and msg, artificial flavors and colors, and to relearn better eating habits.  Two years down the road, she is allergy free, healthy, energetic and has a beautiful coat.<br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: To jazz up the kibble
review/text: I have this on automatic shipping once a month.  It's great to have a case of dog food on hand to jazz up the kibble.  We board labs and goldens in our home so sometimes dogs need a little something extra to make the food special enough to eat.  This does the trick.  And it's a high quality canned dog food too.  Far better than carting a case or even 1/2 dozen cans from the supermarket.  Love having it shipped right to my door, having it discounted and no shipping charge through Subscribe and Save.  Great service!

review/summary: Disgusting
review/text: I was very excited to find this product, having really enjoyed Newman's Own products in the past and coming to trust them.  I am also a firm believer in feeding the best grain free diet to my Labs, and 95% organic beef went well with that.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the product is disgusting.  The consistency of what comes out of the can is disturbing.  Try to imagine dried out peanut butter that is impossible to separate or spread.  No amount of water that I added would allow me to use a fork (and knife) to try to separate the product and mix it with my dry kibble.<br /><br />Instead, I am trying the new Castor & Pollux Organix Grain Free product, and hoping for the best.<br />[...]

review/summary: Vile odor (Canned Beef)
review/text: We got our Canned Beef from Amazon around last summer but opened it just now.  It smells vile.  No way we are giving it our dogs.  Not sure if this a variation or do they always smell that bad.  Definitely deleting it from the Subscribe and Save list.

review/summary: DON'T BUY THIS FOR ITS GRAIN FREE ATTRIBUTES.
review/text: OK, for those that think they may be buying a grain free product, DON'T BUY THIS.  My yellow lab is bad with any grains and causes her to have asthma attacks (really, really bad attacks).  Tried this first time last night and she woke up coughing and wheezing.  WTF I thought and sure enough, it has oat bran in it.  My stupid dumb ***, I trust Newman's to have a product accurately reflecting the products on the label.  Brown rice and chicken aren't oats.  I guess my lesson learned is trust no one and read all the labels (actually did before i bought, must have missed it though). I didn't miss it,but Amazon has proven they are wonderful when it comes to taking care of their customers if they feel there was an error or communication problem.  I will continue to use Amazon for most of my shopping, given the incredible value of unlimited 2 day shipping for $75/year

review/text: I love Newman's products, but my dog hated it.  We purchased a case hoping to feed our dog something that doesn't contain all of the artificial chemicals, but he wanted nothing to do with it!  If you like organic, support Newman's products.  Hopefully your dog will like it better.

review/summary: GOOD FOOD ...BAD PACKAGING
review/text: just received a case of 12 chicken & brown rice formula...every single can was dented beyond use...this was a problem before and supposedly amazon was to get their shipping problem with this item corrected...it states that this item is not returnable although damaged, i wrote to amazon requesting a return label and credit ...will see what happens...i want to return the case of food so they can see the damage, there were 4 air pillows in the box but they had holes torn in them so they were flat and just laying on top of the food...ordered this product from another website while waiting for amazon to straighten out their shipping problem, the other company sent the order UPS and the case of food was surrounded by the Styrofoam pellets and not a dent one !...UPDATE... Amazon replace order, came UPS this time instead of USPS, air pillows were again torn and flat, but only one can barely dented,...Also, i opened one of the dented cans from the first order, bad smell and food was pulled away from the sides, so take care with dented cans of dog/cat food
