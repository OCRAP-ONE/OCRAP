review/summary: Good pears... bad service
review/text: I recently placed an order from this company and was very disappointed.  I paid extra to have pears "gift wrapped" with a note attached.  Not only were the pears not gift wrapped, they were loose in bubble wrap in a fed ex box.  I will never order from this coampny again.

review/summary: Try them in coffee
review/text: High marks for getting it in only two days, with only one bottle damaged. On the debit side, the bottles are a little smaller than the ones Anthon Berg makes, and the spirits don't seem to have the same kick. Variety could have been better; only six different brands out of thirteen available for this product. For coffee use, brandy works best, followed by the various whisky types. Forget champagne or vodka (too strong). Still, it's a nice gift for someone who isn't a connoisseur.

It may cost a little bit more than Kellogg's Corn Flakes but it contains no artificial ingredients or preservatives while Kellogg's puts BHT in many of their products as a preservative. Many people don't realize what BHT is.<br /><br />BHT- Butylated hydroxytoluene, is a lipophilic (fat-soluble) organic compound that is primarily used as an antioxidant food additive (E number E321) as well as in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, jet fuels, rubber, petroleum products, and embalming fluid.<br /><br />This substance has been linked with cancer and increased hyperactivity in children.

review/summary: Beware of New Great Taste
review/text: For years I have been buying Barbara's corn flakes. The reason was they seemed very natural. They were a light yellow color, delicate and minimally processed. You could taste the freshness of the corn. I recently reordered the product from Amazon as I have done for years. On the front of the box is written"New Great Taste." So it's not the box pictured here.<br /><br />This is a completely different product and I will not be reordering it. It is light brown whereas the old one was pale yellow. It has obviously been toasted several shades darker. The taste is dry not fresh. Due to the excessive toasting, I feel there has been nutrient loss. I'll be looking for another fresher corn flake to start my day.<br /><br />It saddens me to write this cause I really loved the old product and never tired of it,<br /><br />I will try to return my remaining  5 boxes to Barbaras since they cannot be returned to Amazon.

review/summary: Tapioca?  In *my* tea?  It's more common than you think.
review/text: Admittedly, I'm not the greatest chef, so take my review with a grain of salt. I recently became addicted to bubble tea. So rather than blowing 15+ bucks a week on it, I decided to start treating myself at home.  The tapioca itself is high quality, with texture and flavor much like you find in stores, and it seems to keep fairly well.  The problem I found is that the instructions for cooking the pearls on the package are fairly... incorrect.  Tapioca requires a much longer cooking time than advertised, and also, despite them having a fairly high sugar content naturally, in order to give them that sweet, syrupy taste you get from the stores, you'll have to coat and/or cook them in a boat load of sugar (a mixture of brown/white sugar will do, I prefer to use agave nectar personally).  So give it a shot, and also don't forget to order the milk tea powder!

review/text: I'm addicted to bubble tea so when the local restaurant where I would always stop and pick up one went out of business, I was left with some cravings for my favorite drink.  I was surprised how easy it was to make these - though these cook relatively fast, I would say let them boil for at least 7-10 minutes opposed to the directions which say 5.  Overall, though, very happy with my purchase and will be ordering again soon.

review/text: At home, there are no bubble tea shops or ethnic grocery stores so I bought these tapioca pearls to satisfy my cravings for bubble tea.  These need to cook longer than the packaging suggests to get that perfect consistency, but it didn't take long.<br /><br />These pearls have a funny taste to them that bubble tea shop tapioca doesn't have...I make a sugar syrup and everything and they still have an odd flavor.  It's not particularly unpleasant, just different.  I still enjoyed them.  Try them in tea, coffee, juice, soda, etc.

review/text: This brand of tapioca pearls is really good. However, I'm wondering why it's over $6. There is an Asian market down the way from me that sells this exact brand, exact same size for under $3. I read the description and it doesn't appear to be that you would get more than 1 bag. I would hope that at this price, you'd at least get 2 bags.  Anyway, I like this brand better than any that i've tried.

I bought them because I moved away from some of my favorite Thai restaurants (who sold Thai tea with boba) and I can brew my own thai tea, pop these in it and it is delicious. The only slight problem is that they take a bit longer to cook than is advertised on the packaging (which says 5-7 minutes). Just leave them boiling a few minutes longer and you'll get the right consistency. All-in-all a great purchase!

Just like the ones I had in the store. I made the whole bag because it was about 1 1/2 cups. I'm using them, but I wish I would have ordered more or a bigger bag so I can make more when these are gone. I also made a simple suryp to put over them. That was easy too. Two thumbs up for these pearls!

Simply boil these pearls for five minutes in water or whatever flavored water or juice you want and let them sit covered for 20 minutes.

review/summary: Easy to make boba!
review/text: Like the other reviewers, I love boba tea and wanted to be able to make it at home. This bag is my first attempt at cooking large tapioca; so far, so good! I followed the directions on the bag and they seem to work-- the trick is to wait until the tapioca pearls start to look plump before covering and boiling for 5 minutes. I do like the idea of adding sugar to the water, as some other reviews have done, and I will try that in the future!<br />My only complaints so far:<br />- Sometimes I get tapioca pearls that are too plump to fit through a wide straw.<br />- They do not 'keep' well once cooked, as they get hard and chewy fairly quickly, so now I only make enough for 1 tea at a time. (The bag does advise that if this happens, reheat to soften them, but I haven't tried this trick yet).<br /><br />Overall I am pleased!

review/text: So an above review made me think I could microwave these. DON'T!<br /><br />It's much better boiled properly. But I agree with the more time statement others are giving.<br />Personally I just added, probably 1/4 of a cup of sugar (for all of it) to the water and they turned out alright. Not like the ones you get normally, but pretty good.<br /><br />Try with a smaller amount first though to get the sugar ratio you like.<br /><br />Overall, a really good product and at a good price. I wish shipping wasn't so much, but since I have found it in a store yet, this will do.

review/summary: yumm, but I've had better!
review/text: These were fun to try out, but they do not taste as great as the boba pearls from the boba shops & thai restraunts. They get slightly sticky and sometimes hard if you let them sit out, so try to cook as many as you will eat, so you won't have leftovers :)

review/summary: Tapioca Pearl
review/text: To begin with, I wasn't able to find any tapioca balls at the Asian market near my house. Every time I went and asked they would look at me funny, like if I were going to steal there products. Eventually I ordered them online.... The product is great but the shipping is too much money. Not really worth buying online. I'm trying to save money and in total I spent $9 something with shipping and handling. Is $2.50 really cheap? NO. just try to go to a store better.

review/summary: Large Capers from Italy = YUMMY
review/text: My husband is from Sicily and when there a few summers ago, we bought a large bag of these type of capers (in Lipari). When we ran out, off I went to look on Amazon and low and behold, these arrived and we were thrilled. They have the same flavor as the ones we bought while in Sicily and they are from Pantelleria which my husband says is the place known for capers.  They have keep well in the refrigerator for the past months.  They have TONS of salt so make sure you rinse them very, very , very well before using!!

review/text: I'm on to my 2nd bag of these capers.  They're pricey, but the flavor is so much better than those in brine that they seem like a bargain.<br /><br />One piece of advice - rinse the capers, then soak them in water for at least 15 minutes (and 30 isn't over-doing it) to remove some of the saltiness.  They're more enjoyable that way.

review/summary: Great Taste!
review/text: I've been searching for a good-tasting protein drink since I had a gastric bypass 3 years ago. I saw this product on another weight loss surgery blog and decided to give it a try. You can drink it warm (unlike most other protein drinks) or cold and it mixes quite easily if you use a container with a blender ball. I thought it was a bit too thick when I mixed it according to the directions (2 scoops in 12-14 oz. of water) so the next time I used more water. Others might prefer the thicker version, though. I also added crushed ice after I mixed it which kept it cold longer and made it more like an iced coffee drink. When I travel, I take my empty blender ball container in my carryon bag, stuffed with ziploc bags filled with protein shake powders but on my next trip will be taking these packets instead.

review/summary: Metallic Taste is the Deal Breaker
review/text: Purchased this to use for travel as it's difficult to find iced coffee in most hotels & using water to mix makes it the perfect travel drink. I so wanted to love this. You have to shake vigorously - preferably using a shaker with a stirring ball or filter - as it's VERY grainy & takes about 2 minutes of solid shaking. Grainy I can live with, but the taste is the deal breaker. It has an incredibly strong metallic taste. The only way to soften the taste is to add lots of milk, which defeats my purpose of bringing a water mixing drink to travel. It's expensive for the convenience and would have been worth it - if only I could drink it. Oh well, the search for a traveling, water mixing iced coffee continues.

review/text: I disagree with the earlier review. This syrup has a wonderful but not too sweet taste. Stonewall Kitchen recommends this syrup on their pumpkin pancakes. They were absolutely right! Wonderful on pumpkin and also sweet potato pancakes. I tried Bruce's sweet potato pancake mix and used this syrup and amazing! I do love IHOP's butter pecan as well, but they are quite different, but in good ways.

review/summary: good
review/text: I work at CVS and whenever someone buys this water bottle, it's because of how appealing the bottle actually looks rather than the water. These come in two different types of bottle, one being glass and other being plastic. This one is a plastic bottle. Don't get me wrong, the plastic bottle still looks beautiful and is very sturdy, it's not your average poland spring bottle. Aside from the looks, the taste of the water is no different than Poland Spring or Nestle bottled water. These usually sell for $1.60 at CVS so, this price online is kind of high. If you really want to try this water, or just want the bottle for the look and future use, just go to a local drugstore or grocery and pick one up. It will be much cheaper and you will get to see and feel the bottle in person to see if it's for you. Overall, it's a good buy and offers a very appealing bottle but the taste is pretty much the same as any other bottled water. I personally bought a bottle because it is so sturdy and I can refill it for everyday use, plus the appealing presentation of the bottle doesn't hurt either.

review/summary: Good Texture, Long Lasting
review/text: This is by far my family's favorite gum. The mint flavor is extremely refreshing and each piece retains its soft, pliable texture for a very long time. A single piece typically lasts me 30 minutes of vigorous chewing, and up to an hour of more casual chewing. I chew a piece if I'm hungry and it's not quite mealtime, when I need to concentrate on something at work, and after a meal if I'm unable to brush my teeth right away.<br /><br />This flavor has become unavailable to purchase locally, and the Subscribe and Save option is working out well for us. We really do chew a lot of this gum.

I purchase the mini size because it is not too big for her and she can handle it for eating or carrying it around.

review/summary: These are a MUST!!!
review/text: My dogs LOVE these Smartbones!  So much so that they sometimes turn their noses at other treats I try to give them.  These bones are a great alternative to rawhide, and Amazon & Co. have some of the lowest prices on them.  I have seen them sold for as high as $15.99 in some local stores.  The only downside is that they do not last very long, as they are so easy to chew through.  My dogs (Lab mix and Boxer mix) power through the medium and large sized bones in just a few minutes.  Still, all in all, worth the money!

review/text: Pedigree Adult Complete Nutrition contains mostly grains instead of meat. The main ingredient is corn which difficult for dogs to digest and causes allergy and yeast infection problems. There little meat that exists are of low quality. In addition, it contains chicken by-products which is "a meal consisting of the ground, rendered, clean parts of the carcass of slaughtered chicken, such as necks, feet, undeveloped eggs and intestines, exclusive of feathers, except in such amounts as might occur unavoidable in good processing practice." (AAFCO definition) It also contains chemical preservatives which is banned from use in human food and unnecessary artificial colorants.<br /><br />Pedigree Adult Complete Nutrition is unsuitable as a source of nutrition and should not be given to any dog. After reading up on proper dog nutrition, I have tossed my half-used 20lbs bag in the trash. Now feeding my dog "Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul" instead.

review/summary: This salt will change your life
review/text: Those searching high and low for salt that will change their life can end their journey with Murray River Sea Salt.<br /><br />I first stumbled on this salt at a local outlet of a cultlike nationwide chain store that pretends to sell only the highest quality foods but also happily lends its imprimatur to made-in-China foods that sometimes turn out to be tainted.  But, ignoring other controversies associated with that store, one day a package of this salt sold by that store stirred my interest which led to the salt completing the last step of its long and probably ecologically-unsound trip from Australia to my kitchen.<br /><br />Here's the thing about Murray River salt:  Its pinkish flakes are fragile and crumble easily in your fingers.  It also seems to dissolve almost immediately on contact with food.  This is in sharp contrast to every other salt I've tried.  We currently have 6 or 8 other kinds of coarse-crystal salt in the house.  None of them can be crushed in your fingers.  They remain large, hard chunks of salt.  Yes, they represent other flavors than the Murray River salt, but there is something gentle and friendly about this salt.  I have a totally-unsubstantiated theory that this salt is better for your body than the hardened crystals of other salts.<br /><br />Our household keeps Murray River salt in a salt cellar (in our case a small lidded wooden bowl) from which it is pinched with the fingers (instead of using the traditional tiny spoon) and crumbled directly onto food on the plate.  For sanitary reasons, only a small amount of the salt at a time is put in the bowl.  That way the bowl gets cleaned frequently.  Frequent cleaning seems like a necessity when fingers, even washed ones, are the tools of choice for dispensing the salt.  Words to the wise: If you invite nose-pickers to your table, provide a salt shaker and hide the Murray River stuff till they've left.  If you have small children in your home, wait until they are grown and are draining your bank account at the safe distance of some far-off college before purchasing and placing this salt on your table.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that they use this as a finishing salt.  Our household concurs.  We rarely if ever add this salt to anything in the cooking process.  We keep Kosher salt and a couple of sea salts for most larger-salt-use cooking needs, like baking (which frankly seems like the only time one should add much salt to the cooking process).  But this is the good stuff for your table and the food you serve on it.<br /><br />The chain store mentioned above no longer carries this salt so Amazon is the logical alternative.<br /><br />Note that I purchased a 1lb bag, which keeps well because I live in a desert.  But next time I'll probably purchase a multi-pack of the smallest bags for a small amount more per unit weight in exchange for the convenience of having smaller packages.

review/text: I have cooked pastas for more years than I care to tell and I've never experienced anything quite like this. True to Italian pasta, this product keeps its al dente quality but cracks and falls apart into many pieces along the ridges. I cooked a second bag to make sure it wasn't a fluke, but it happened again. This is a nice tasting pasta, which is the reason I gave it three stars, but it defeats the whole purpose of rigatoni (at least in my recipes). I wish I could believe the post office just handled this package roughly, but I'm not sure if I'll buy it again. Has anyone else had this problem?

review/text: With almost no freezer space, I can't keep an endless supply of chicken broth on hand as much as I'd like to. Also, with the price of chicken, making one's own stock is an expensive proposition.<br /><br />These days, I make broth for important dishes and use the Organic Broth for most everything else.<br /><br />Cook's Illustrated rated this broth the best next to homemade from about 8 other competitors.<br /><br />I like the fact that it's organic, low in sodium and free range, as well. It's also nice to have on hand. With subscribe and save, it's a lot less than the $3.00 average it costs here in the local markets.<br /><br />The broth has a clean flavor profile and while I wouldn't use it for a chicken soup by itself, I do use it with stronger flavored soups, such as tomato. It doesn't taste overly fake to me.<br /><br />I also like the shelf stable packaging and that an open container is good for 3 or 4 days in the fridge.

review/summary: Leaky Cartons - Be Careful To Inspect Closely!
review/text: I ordered this product last month and, after removing from outer box, very casually visually inspected plastic-wrapped cartons for major damage before putting into pantry.  Very careless on my part, especially since I've received damaged foodstuffs from Amazon recently. However, I'd ordered a different variety of Swanson's, also in the cardboard cartons, from Amazon earlier in the year with no problem so I foolishly took for granted that this shipment would be okay, as well.  HUGE mistake!<br /><br />When I finally got around to removing the plastic to use the first box tonight I noticed that one of the corners was slightly crushed and worn-looking around plastic outer ring that surrounds inner foil pull off tab and that plastic tab itself looked somewhat off-kilter, as if it weren't seated tightly. The glue, or whatever substance they've used to seal the plastic onto carton apparently failed for some reason, or maybe too little was used?  I gently squeezed carton to see if any air escaped; it did.  This made me take a closer look at the other cartons and some of them were visibly swollen and oozed a bit and released a foul odor when also squeezed gently. Upon opening to pour down the garbage disposal the smell became overwhelming.  However, two of the cartons I checked later did NOT smell noticeably rank when squeezing, even though seal was not intact, as proven by escaping air so I'm concerned that it would be easy for someone to unknowingly use product with a faulty seal.<br /><br />If you've ordered this product, or plan to, PLEASE take time to carefully inspect each carton when it arrives.

He ate an entire can in one sitting and now eats it as his staple.  I sometimes mix it with dry food and vitamin powder and he still eats it up.  There is a definite smell of bananas, bit there is also corn and other veggies in it.<br /><br />If you have a finicky box turtle or are looking for a good food to fortify an exiting turtle diet, this is a real option!
