review/summary: It's Caffeinated Chewing Gum
review/text: It's expected to taste weird, but I found it to taste really awful. The spearmint makes it worse, almost accenting the bitterness. Cinnamon would've made it slightly better. I don't think mint would cut down on the caffeine additives taste. However, two pieces works like a good cup of coffee. There isn't much of a crash afterward, either.

review/text: Great product, does what it says on the tin; each piece has a reasonable dose of caffeine, it gets the job done, and has a great taste to boot. Highly recommended if you use/need caffeine but don't want to deal with coffee (or energy drinks, for that matter).

review/summary: Chewable Caffein Goodness - Highly Recommended!
review/text: "Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum" is one of my family's favorite ways of getting a good caffeine kick in a hurry. It is good tasting and very fast acting. We keep several packs in the cars and usually even in the house for when there isn't time to get a pot of coffee going. Taking two or three of these really gets me going!<br /><br />Recommended! I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FTVEA6">Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum, Icy Mint, 12-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V2NBLW">Jolt Mints</a>.<br /><br />CFH

review/text: The first time I tried Cherry Cola Zevia, I thought...Hmm...This is a little strange. The stranger thing, I've really grown to like it in like 2 days. I'm not a big cherry fan but this is great tasting and I look forward to drinking it every day. I'm on the p90x diet and this helps liven things up a bit, break up the monotony or make something thats not particularly appetizing easier to get through. I've taken the print out fliers from the Zevia website to 3 stores in my area hoping they will stock it, because shockingly, none of them do...I guess they need the room for generic brand Big K cola drink...blagh...Cherry Cola Zevia is a great addition and I highly recommend it. Let them grow on you.

I contacted the manufacturer and asked about this.  They said it can be eaten during any time of the year, and then they asked that I stop calling them.  The moral of the story is that you can eat this tasty product anytime you want and that restraining orders will not lessen its tastiness.

review/text: Been eating these things since I was a little kid and never gets old. Beef is definitely my favorite flavor. Very quick to make and make you feel better when your not feeling all that good. A really cheap food to make also when you don't feel like spending small fortune. I make it sorta what the package suggests but add more water, not too much to dilute the flavor, but enough because i like the broth. I don't add all that other kind of things that other people tend to add like an egg or hot sauce, I like it all by itself. Life is better with Beef Ramen... of course every college kid would say that  :)

Now my adult sons use only Morton Salt Substitute in their homes.  I've fooled people who say, "they would never use any type of substitute because they can tell the difference".  Well, they couldn't!! If I can't find it in a grocery store or supermarket, I order it online because it's the only thing that tastes like salt.

review/text: I've used this product for several years.  Daily habit at breakfast time.  Over the past year, ordering through Amazon from two different vendors, the product (not the shipping) has arrived in poor condition.  Soft and stale for the Oats & Honey (another reviewer found this to be true), crubled and dry for the peanut.  The only one in fairly good shape, but not really acceptable, has been the maple brown sugar. So, I've CANCELLED a long-standing automatic order.  You can only take poor product so long when you must finally give up and move on to something else.  Is it the fault of the manufacturer, or of Amazon, or the vendor?  Does it make a difference - the 'bottom line' is the product is no longer an acceptable product.

This variety has chunks of meat, kinda like squares actually, mixed in with a thick gravy.  I'm surprised that my male passed it up but since they both gave it the "paws down" response, it must be something in the mix.  Cannot recomend this one - try one of the others first.

review/text: If I have one negative thing to say about this candy, it's that I miss the days before the sanitary individual plastic wrappers, when the candy only had the clever little rice wrapper that melted in your mouth.  The rice wrapper is still there, under the plastic one, and it still melts in your mouth in that odd (but happy-making), gluey way.  But the plastic wrapper sort of spoils the joke.  The candy itself is perfection, sweet and light, great mouth-feel.  You can chew it or let it melt slowly on your tongue.  I buy it by the case.

Silver Springs also makes my favorite cocktail sauce, but I've always found it in refrigerated sections at the supermarket, which is probably why Amazon doesn't carry it. With both the jalapeno mustard and the cocktail sauce, I find that I buy things as an excuse to put the condiments on top of, as the mustard or the cocktail sauce are always my favorite parts of the meal.

In the past we have bought the fancy bag and the little hammer to go with it, but that is all unnecessary. We crack it with the back of a heavy kitchen spoon in a plastic bowl.

Yes, it's expensive and yes, I worry about giving it to him in the car (in case I slam on the break) or when he is running around (in case he falls) but overall, I'm happy with the ingredients and I will keep buying.  Having said that, I am not completely happy with regard to Amazon's fulfillment.  I purchased these in September 2012 and the expiration date shows October 2012.  This is the second time I received "nearly" expired Fiddlesticks from Amazon.  I purchased different flavour Fiddlesticks from a local retail store before I purchased these from Amazon and its expiration date is April 2013.  That makes me think that these particular Fiddlesticks have been sitting in the hot Amazon warehouse for over 8 months before my son gets his hands on them.  Technically, they are not expired but I don't think I will buy these again from Amazon.  I don't like to give snacks to my son that often and I'm not sure if he will finish all 6 boxes in 30+ days.

review/text: I picked these up the other day from Sprouts, very pricey but thought I'd see what my daughter thought of them.  She's 14 months and enjoys a variety of these types of snacks and banana is generally her favorite flavor.<br /><br />She bit into them with curiosity but then examined them a little further, took one more bite and then abandoned the stick.  I noticed it seemed very dry for her.  I tried a few more times and got the same result, after two bites she was done with these.  If I let her hold them I noticed she tried to take pieces out of it to put in her mouth but then a lot of it crumbled.  These are more meant to be bitten.<br /><br />So I decided to try it out for myself and see what they were like.  I absolutely loved them as odd as that may sound.  They're a little bland, very lightly sweetened, smell great, and have a hit of banana flavor.  They're like tea biscuits (actually they go well with tea but they're dry and you definitely need liquid around while having these).<br /><br />Anyway, I guess you won't know if your little one will like these until you try them so I wouldn't get this bulk pack from Amazon just yet.  Although the price here saves you about 70 cents over the store price, and a little more if you subscribe and save.<br /><br />We'll be sticking to the Gerber Graduates Fruit & Veggie Melts which take first place in favorite snacks for my daughter.

review/summary: Easy to drink, not easy to handle!
review/text: I bought this tea as a recommendation from a hydro colon therapist. She said regular laxatives can be very harmful to the colon, and recommended this tea as a natural and safe way to encourage more regular bowel movements.<br /><br />When I got it, I was really pleased to see that it was indeed all natural, and it tasted fine (certainly bearable!). So as the package directs, I  drank it before going to bed. I woke up with bearable cramping a few times early in the morning (around the time they predicted movement) -- when I finally got out of bed and tried to use the bathroom I felt incredibly ill. I was sweating like you can't imagine, very very very nauseous and no real bowel movement to relieve all of these symptoms. The cramping in these moments was comparable to bad period cramps -- (for the men reading this just imagine being kicked in the balls) after all of this I threw up and went back to bed and felt better later that day.<br /><br />I should note that I've never tried laxatives before, and that I have tried suppositories, which yielded the same reaction for me (minus the cramping).<br /><br />My suggestions -- If you're going to try this tea, chase it with lots of water and a banana or something so that perhaps your bowels are more willing to move. I also wouldn't recommend trying this the night before you have to be somewhere like work. You'll be fine later that day if your reaction is anything like mine but shortly after waking up you might not be in such great shape.<br /><br />Good luck!

review/summary: No bitterness great flavor and it does work
review/text: Tying to find a tea that didn't have that bitter taste was difficult; and the cost of teas is not cheap anymore.  I was trying many of the healing teas, but they had stevia added to them and I could not get past the taste of that.  This tea is not bitter, and has a very nice smooth flavor.  I have had it both hot and cold.  I do feel that I am energized after drinking it, but it is not a jittery hyper feeling; it is more of an awake and alert feeling mentally and refreshed energized physical feeling.  Some reviewers state it has a sweet taste to it but I do not get that.  While I do not often add my 1/2 packet of sugar in the raw to it perhaps that is what they mean; that you do not have to add sugar to it.  I have replaced my second cup of coffee in the morning with this tea and I even have another cup throughout the day instead of coffee.  Excellent taste and an all around great product.

review/summary: I drink this instead of coffee
review/text: I usually don't drink tea because it doesn't have the caffeine kick I'm looking for, but guayusa tea has almost as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. And unlike coffee, it doesn't need to be drowned in cream and sugar to taste good and doesn't have any of the other unpleasant side effects. I usually add about half a spoonful of sugar per cup, which is enough to pleasantly complement the natural flavor. Now if only Starbucks would start carrying guayusa...

I used to swear by matcha green tea, but Runa is a superior alternative in that it's super-cheap, more energizing, much easier to swallow, and offers just as many health benefits.<br /><br /> Also, if you look into it, Runa's doing some great things on the side of social entrepreneurship and rainforest conservation. I highly suggest reading into it-- it'll make you love the product even more.

review/summary: Don't knock it til ya try it.
review/text: You'd be surprised how much Runa Tea can help you in your daily life. Thirsty or not, Hot or cold, this tea can help you in many ways. As a college student studying to be an entrepreneur, I can't just take prescribed drugs all the time to keep my attention span up. Instead, I turn to caffeine all day every day. Runa Tea has been one of the few products that have really caused me to feel refreshed as if I was just hydrated after a run, as well as feeling focused as if I were ready to write a 10 page paper from scratch. I don't know what it is, but it just makes you feel good in every way. Personally, I love the cold tea- but as a consumer everyone needs to find their niche, as I am a huge hot tea drinker and chose the cold version- Either way, same thing.  You need to try it. And then try and contradict our 5 star opinions! :)

review/summary: Taste Good, Do Good
review/text: As much of a tea fanatic as I consider myself, I'd never heard of guayasa before running into the Runa brand. Now that I have, I could see myself buying it over and over again! It has a full-bodied flavor without the bitter aftertaste of some black teas. It's earthy without being heavy-handed or overpowering, completely unique from any other tea I've tasted. You won't find tea like this anywhere else. And though the product speaks for itself, the business model of this brand doesn't hurt: Runa buys guayusa directly from local farmers in Ecuador at fair-trade prices. Try it! It's worth every cent :)

This tea is smooth and easy to drink, and is absolutely delicious with sugar and honey.<br />Another awesome thing about this tea is the dreams you get. My mother hasn't had a lucid dream in years, and I offered this tea to her one day, and that night she had three vivid lucid dreams! She was so thrilled she bought two more boxes of the Runa guayusa tea. I am so satisfied with this product, and would definitely recommend to anyone who needs some steady energy, focus, and vivid dreams. :)

review/summary: As good as advertised
review/text: I saw an ad for Runa guayusa in Mother Jones magazine and because it is a Fair Trade item and described as less bitter than tea, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />It is exactly as advertised - no bitterness, just a little hint of sweetness, and a nice gentle flavor.  Very easy drinking, and it does give a kick of caffeine energy.  I have been a Diet Pepsi / Diet Coke drinker for 25 years because I like their tastes and the caffeine (never could do coffee and tea is too bitter), but I have recently converted to being a bicycle commuter for work and needed to ditch the heavy soda drinks.  This guayusa is perfect - as tea bags, it is obviously lighter than hauling around sodas, and it has more caffeine too.  Better for me, too.  And no bitterness like tea or coffee.  And I'm supporting fair trade small farmers in Ecuador instead of giant soda companies.  The packaging is 100% recycled, 70% post-consumer.<br /><br />This guayusa is as good as advertised, I like drinking it, and I can't think of any negatives.  5 stars.  I'm glad I found this product, it is worth the price.

review/summary: Bait and switch
review/text: These USED to be an excellent value but in Sept/Oct 2011, Seasons changed their can design (which itself is a good thing because the old cans were difficult to open), BUT they put in less sardines and the sardines are now of an inferior quality. The old can had a printed net weight of 3.75 oz, and there were in fact about 3.8 oz of sardines in the can...6-7 tender, moist yummy sardines. Now, in the new cans (which open from the corner), the actual weight of the sardines is about 3 oz...almost a 1/4 loss of product (the printed weight is STILL 3.75 oz)...AND THE PRICE IS STILL THE SAME. What makes it worse is that the sardines are big (2-3 sardines vs the older 5-6 sardines, dry, tough and have an off smell. If you get a can which opens from the top, you're good to go, but if you have the newer can which opens from the corner, you're getting an inferior sardine and paying more for less. Another example of an American company sacrificing quality for higher profits.

review/text: Nothing "fishy" about these little fishes! The sardines are larger than the brisling, but have a very mild flavor and fresh firm texture. The olive oil used is light tasting as well. Because these sardines are skinless and boneless, it is very simple to prepare them in your favorite dish in no time flat! I just open the can (which is the easy open variety) and dump the whole contents on a bowl of salad greens, squeeze a little fresh lemon, and voila!; the PERFECT FAST FOOD! 'couldn't ask for a faster, more nutritious and delicious meal! Enjoy!

review/summary: Somewhat Larger and Firmer, but Excellent Taste.
review/text: I've been on a campaign to add more fish to my diet and a lot of it has been by increasing my uptake of canned fish such as tuna, salmon and sardines. As such, I found a wrapped five-pack of Season Sardines at my local Costco store and picked it up. They're a good sardine and I've been eating them with seasoned crackers at lunchtime. Their somewhat larger than normal for me and they have a texture that is somewhat firm. The taste is excellent and they go down easily. My cat loves to lick the leftover crumbs on the plate. I don't care for Season Sardines as much as for the last can of Crown Prince bristling sardines, but the difference is slight. I would definitely buy this brand again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Season Skinless-Boneless sardines used to be of great quality and value, but for the past year or so they have been almost inedible.  I don't know what happened, but the sardines are huge, have a strange dark color, and smell and taste disgusting.  They were a staple of my diet, so this recent precipitous decline in quality is very disappointing. These companies need to learn that it does not pay to cut costs and jip customers.  I'd rather pay more money for something that's palatable, than this awful stuff that they are now putting in their cans.

review/summary: Tasty Sardine Goodness
review/text: Easy to review, the best sardines I have ever had.  Superior to regular sardines in several respects to my taste anyway.  The lack of skin and bones seems to remove all objectionable things in these tasty tiny fish, I forced my sardine hating nephew to share a can of these with me and now I can't keep him out of my Sardine Stash, he still balks at the full featured sardines and I can't blame him as I too now eat only these sardines I gave away a whole case of regular Season Sardines, same brand but no comparison these are just plane tasty and no fishiness at all.  I sill usually for a snack eat these with a little honey mustard, wow, a satisfying way to stay on my diet.<br /><br />Even if you only kind of like sardines or even if you don't like them try these as they taste nothing like run of the mill sardines, they kind of taste closer to canned tuna than normal sardines that I have a hard time eating at times too.

review/text: and i prefer these. these aren't really fillets, but full sardines, with skin and bones but without the head and tail. neither the skin nor the bone changes the flavor or texture of the fish--the bones are soft and the skin is mild and tender. the flavor is full, slightly salty, and pleasant. good texture. the olive oil is bland (not a bad thing). the crown prince sardines, on the other hand, are very clean (no skin, no bones) and very mild. it depends on whether you like fish, or you're eating them only because they're good for you. me, i like oily fishes, so i prefer seasons. anyway, there's hardly anything easier or tastier than two pieces of excellent, toasted bread, a thick layer of maille mustard, and these sardines. a perfect, healthful, inexpensive, and "green" meal. clocks in at 480 calories and keeps you full all afternoon...

review/summary: Not like the old days...
review/text: When I was growing up, every year just after Thanks Giving, our home would be filled with multitudes of boxes from the Swiss Colony. From cheese spreads, meat logs, candies, and most importantly, the petit's fours! I remember Swiss Colony Petit's Fours being much larger, tastier and not dry as stale cake that has been sitting around for months before shipping. I was very disappointed in the flavor and quality of these little cakes and they are not at all the quality I remember growing up. It has been about 14 years since I had anything from the Swiss Colony and I have to say, it will be the last time I order anything from them. There are so many companies out there now that make them bigger, better and fresher (I know, I picked up a box from a famous brand at a local mall kiosk) than what I had when I purchased these. Granted, the price was cheaper...but I guess I got what I paid for. Very disappointed Swiss Colony!

She apologized and is going to make and send out new ones right away. She did pack them in dry ice and and ice packets. Unfortunately, they sat for a day in the West Palm Beach post office in the heat. So, the melting problem was not the fault of the sender. And, they are absolutely adorable and look just like the picture. So, I would definately recommend her and order from her again.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I love these crackers!  I'm new to gluten free, and have not tried many gluten free products. I don't know how these compare to other gluten free crackers.  But I do know that they are as good or better than any regular cracker I've tried.  Cracklebred crackers are light and airy, but very crispy.  They are a little delicate but still hold up under a gentle spread of hummus.  This variety is flavored with sun dried tomato and oregano, but I honestly did not pick up on those flavors.  I thought they tasted slightly savory, but I still enjoyed them with a spread of blueberry jam.  Each cracker contains just 17 calories so they are guilt free.  Yum :)

review/summary: Gluten Free Cracker
review/text: I originally bought the only package of Natural Nectar Cracklebred Sun Dried Tomato and Oregano at a local TJ Maxx store in the gourmet food section because it was gluten free.  I was amazed at how tasty they were!  I spread a little butter on the cracker and it's a wholesome snack for children and adults. As I was unable to find this product in any of our local grocery stores, I searched the Web and found out that I could order the Cracklebred through Amazon.  I keep a box in the office as well as several at home.

review/summary: Love the bars; especially chocolate; DIDN'T GET CHOCOLATE + ???
review/text: I had just purchased a 96 bar package of the regular NV Crunchy Oats Bars at Sam's Club--which no longer carries chocolate in my city.  Smaller packages at my grocery store disappear quickly. There are seldom any left. I DID NOT GET WHAT I ORDERED!  But since I would eventually eat them because I alternate regular and chocolate, I kept them.  Tried to order the 96 bar size of chocolate today and there is only 1 seller listed and the price is TWICE the stated regular price!  Is everyone asleep?  Also, should the manufacturers hear this, you have created alternatives that are much less good for my health and clearly are substituting those fatty/sweet bars for the ones that are healthiest!

review/text: I used to get these shipped from Canada because I couldn't find them anywhere locally, so I'm so happy to see Amazon has them now! I've tried all the Rebar flavors, and the Seeds n Greens are my favorites. I don't understand the reviewer who said they taste like cough syrup at all! They taste pleasantly (not overly) sweet and nutty, and moist rather than pasty like a lot of bars. I don't get a pomegranate flavor from them, but they're tasty enough to forgive that!<br /><br />Oh, and they're made of FOOD, which is always nice in an edible product. Ingredients as follows:<br /><br />(*Certified Organic) *Honey, inulin, *dry roasted soy nuts, *sesame seeds, *sunflower seeds, *pumpkin seeds, *apple, *carrots, *spinach, *alfalfa, *cabbage, *broccoli, *kale, *celery, *rosehips, *parsley, *cauliflower, *cucumber, *beets, *bell peppers, *collards, *watercress, *bokchoy, *tomatoes, *date paste, *milled flaxseed, *hemp seed, green tea extract, natural flavour

review/summary: Why on earth are these so high carb and sweet?  Healthy?  NO
review/text: I bought these because of reviews.  Why do I fall for that?  They are so sickeningly sweet that I actually became nauseous eating them.  The first one was tolerable (taste is NOT that great and the ultra-sweetness destroyed it) but after that it went downhill.  The super high carbs for this so-called "healthy" bar spiked my insulin level and I wished I hadn't touched the thing the rest of the day.  If you want healthy then eat the nuts and seeds it contains after buying them yourself without all the carbs and sickly sweetness in these things.  They are weirdly textured as well.  I can't stand them but according to other reviews you must either love them or hate them.  I hate them.  I don't recommend them.  Take out half of those carbs and cut down on that gross sweetness and I'll try them again.

review/text: I have been trying to find a dry cat food that consists of good nutrition, organic veggies, organic meat, meat meal, vitamins, and everything that my kitties need to have a healthy diet.  I used to buy one of the major vet brands, but found that the carbs were extremely high.  I have a cat that is diabetic.  After doing research on what is best for indoor and/or diabetic kitties, I have found this food to be exactly what I was looking for.  Not to forget the best of all....  all three of my kitties absolutely love this food!  There was no problem making the food switch.  Thank you for such a wonderful product!

review/summary: You'll notice a difference!
review/text: I have tried various cat foods that are high protein, and this is one of my cat's favorites. But I suggest you alternate various kinds of food over any given week--if they're on sale I often feed my cat cooked chicken wings or thighs, fish, or whatever he likes that we happen to be eating. Feeding a variety of food lessens the risk of your cat getting TOO much of anything that may have gotten into one particular brand. I think the idea that it's difficult for cats to adjust to a change of food is just ridiculous, and any bad reaction is probably an indication that you shouldn't use that food at all. It's not much trouble to seek out a variety, and our cats enrich our lives so much that surely they deserve it!

Even tried a slow transition.<br /><br />At one point i even left the bag out, open, on its side, seeing if i could trick him into thinking "JACKPOT".  He would pull a few out, and then pull a few more out... And not eat any of it...  Would not recommend

review/summary: Excellent quality food at a reasonable price
review/text: This food is the best I have found overall. It has a great balance of veggies, greens, vitamins, and of course protein while being grown with out hormones or chemicals used. There are other foods out there which I found to be more expensive that have a nice balance, but they are filled with chemicals and hormones: if they are causing cancer for humans, what would they do to our pets? I can find it at a local pet store that is part of a national chain with the word "smart" in it. The cost is lower than most of the other healthy brands, and of all the healthy cat foods out there, this is the only one my cat will not leave a crumb of! Another good result of this food is "optimal poopers". LOL I don't have to give him wet food to keep him regular. This fact alone shows how good for his digestion it is. It is great if you have cats with sensitive stumachs or food allergies also. I can't say enough good about the food. Try it! Your cat(s) will love you for it!

review/text: Cannellini dried beans. Big, heavy bag, beans, beans and more beans, in bulk. Cheap, cheap cheap for the finest of beans, elegant in an understated way and oh so tasty in the right Italian recipe, and probably many other cuisines too. Nothing to set up, wear out, or fuss with, and packed with a minimum of excess wrapping, just beans, in a bag, in a box. No instructions needed except a good cookbook. Did I mention these were beans that are white in color, smooth and when soaked, and cooked properly, have a creamier, less grainy texture than the more humble Navy bean? No? Good thing I remembered, then. Enjoy in moderation, unless all your family, friends, neighbors, co-workers and innocent bystanders also enjoy lots of beans themselves.

review/text: great candy, just as you would get in the store, however they came shipped in a corrugated cardboard carton direct from jelly belly without a liner ( literally, the candy was just in the box with nothing else- no plastic bag, etc), which was a bit off-putting. However, I assume that if this is how I get it, this is how most retailers get it, meaning I've been eating jelly beans direct from a cardboard box my entire life. I ordered four different flavors of jelly bellies and they all came this way. No one got sick, so I assume this was sanitary.

What I've found out over time, however, is that nothing beats Dove Soap.  It is gentle, works up a great lather and is gentle on the skin.  I love its smell and never buy the unscented variety. For me, part of getting out of the shower is having that fresh soap smell that is so clean.  Dove is as good as any expensive, exotic soap and I'm happy to stick with Dove.

review/text: How can you review soap? OK, it isn't soap, it is a moisturizing bar. But still, it is Dove, it rocks (especially in the dry winter months). But the real kicker for me is buying in quantity. We never run out. I have it in our Subscribe and Save which garners you another 15% off and always free shipping. Amazon has something going on with that Subscribe and Save!
