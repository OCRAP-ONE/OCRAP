review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: My husband makes delicious oatmeal with this, using the method Alton Brown gives on his show "Good Eats."  I understand the frustration of the customers who had previously not gotten the product they had ordered because the seller screwed up. My husband made the same mistake, and fortunately for us, the seller did give us a refund for everything but the shipping costs and has removed the incorrect listing sometime in the last 24 hours. I would normally give this either 3 or 4 stars, but I'm giving it 5 to bring the average up, because I think the oats deserve much more than one star. It's not the oats' fault they were listed wrong.

I must warn you though, eating too many of these will make your teeth hurt and tongue bleed.  I'm not joking.  They really are like super sour sweet tarts.  Good price too.

review/summary: Not for the wimpy
review/text: These are my all time favorite sour candy. The consistancy of this candy is much like sweet tarts candy. I LOVE sour candy, but I am constantly let down by war heads or other "sour" candies. I usually spit other candies out when it gets to the sweet part. I was wanting a candy that is sour the entire time. Not having some wimpy break and have a sweet middle. This candy was my answer. Sour the entire time :D However, I do have a warning. It makes your mouth hurt if you eat too much. Its citric acid for crying out loud.

review/summary: EXCELLENT rawhide chew and very safe!
review/text: I am VERY happy with these chews and that's saying a lot because I usually hate rawhide. My Great Dane normally devours most rawhide treats in 15 minutes and during that time manages to tear off at least one soft wet chunk big enough to choke on and scare the daylights out of me.<br />These PetAg chews are truly CHUNKY - they are very large, made with super thick rawhide, and designed in a way to prolong chewing pleasure. The knots make it so he cannot pull large pieces off to choke on and he has to work very hard to get even small pieces off. Normally if he has to work hard at a chew he will just give up - but not these! He carries them all over the house, plays with them by throwing them in the air (which is very loud, these are HEAVY), and then settles down for some chew time -- they keep him entertained for a good hour or more. In this hour of chewing he does NOT devour the rawhide like many other brands we have tried, he just barely manages to get a small 4 inch section gnawed soft then gets tired and takes a nap. In 3 days he has not gotten bored with this routine and we still have 98% of the original chew left! To me - that is a cost effective chew toy! We also purchased one of the beef basted braids (and will be posting a review with pics there) -- the basting looks to be thoroughly embedded into and throughout all of the rawhide not just brushed on the outside; it also does not come off on his legs, which are white, or my carpet, which is beige --- WONDERFUL!<br />I feel it is important to note also that these chews are MADE IN THE USA (Illinois to be exact). Yes they do say "a product of Brazil" on the outside of the package but they are a PetAg product (a USA company founded in 1930) which is a division of Borden (another USA company). These are all-natural rawhide chews MADE IN THE USA from free range, natural grass-fed BRAZILIAN beef hides (without chemicals, preservatives or bleaches). They are antibiotic, hormone and preservative free. All products are lot-coded for traceability back to the cow.<br /><br />They might seem a bit expensive at first glance, but I have discovered they are high quality, long lasting, and dog entertaining... that to me is worth every penny and if my dog ever makes it through the 2 chews we already have -- I will happily purchase more!

review/text: Bought this for my small dog about 8 months ago and she is still loving it! She is a habitual chewer and quickly destroyed all of the toys we bought for her including the nylon chew bones. Decided to try this large rawhide - mostly because it is made in USA. By now she has chewed one knot completely off and is working her way down to the next knot. She can work on it for hours and it doesn't deteriorate and disappear like other rawhides I've tried. Strongly recommend!

review/text: I was looking for a good, safe bone to give to my big chewer, my Bullmastiff. I was worried about some of the bad reviews, but decided to give it a go. She has been chewing on it almost nonstop for 3 weeks (we take it away from her when it goes pink, or if we aren't around), and is finally at the end of it. She chews it with gusto, it keeps her busy, and she cant tear large chunks off of it tht might hurt her. I'm ready to order another one! I'm very pleased.

review/summary: Great Bone!
review/text: We have a female yellow lab who LOVES to chew. (Or maybe I should say destroy.) She powers through the typical store-bought rawhide bones in anywhere from 30-60 minutes, depending on the size, so I was pleasantly surprised with this wonderful bone! Daisy has been chewing on it for over a week, and she has barely gnawed a small corner off of one knotted end. When she tires of it (because she can't destroy it), we just put a small smear of peanut butter into one of the crannies and she goes to town for another hour or so. I highly recommend this bone and I will definitely buy more of these for my own dog!

I had to take each one away after a few hours, wait several days and give it back to her to finish up in a few more hours.  It also gave her gas.  I do have an aggressive chewer which is why I tried these rather expensive rawhides.  I will not purchase again.

review/text: Like I read on another reviewer's summary - some of the artichoke hearts were tough and I had to discard parts of the hearts. Not the best quality I have had. What they should have done was trim them a little more so that the hard tough parts were not there - I guess they wanted to cheap it out a little and include parts that would have been thrown out if you were making them from fresh Artichokes. I liked that they were not in oil but I did have to wash some of them because they did have a salty flavor.

review/summary: Can vs Frozen
review/text: When I bought Reese Artichoke Hearts, it was less than $25/case and I didn't want to pay for shipping so I had one of my friend bought one for herself with me. It worked out great, the shipping was speedy and ate them fairly quickly since the experation date was quite close. However, It didn't bother me that much since I paid so much less than I normally pay for them at a grocery store.<br /><br />But one thing that I realized was these canned Artichoke isn't as good as Frozen ones.<br />I didn't really notice it until I heard many chefs on TV would say things like "use the fresh artichoke if you could, but if it's not available, use frozen one or those ones in a jar. Not the canned ones." So after I finished with my 12 cans, I started to use the frozen artichoke and I think it actully taste better. Frozen ones don't have that sourness in them. Or maybe it is just me....or just those celebrity chefs on TV....

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I purchased after reading many reviews.  Use on face, chest and hands.  The first application was not dramatic as far as results go; but I use daily and the results are fantastic.  It took me about a week to get the impressive results.  I have very dry skin. My serums and creams were not penetrating into my skin to give me a hydrated look.  Now I can easiy tell when the serums and creams are penetrating.  My skin is much more even in color, hydrated, healthy looking.  I apply the mask work into my skin for a few seconds and leave on for 15 minutes.  Remove  in shower and use a microdermabrasion product to remove dead skin after I rinse off the mask. I use a heavy cream on my skin after my serums to seal in moisture.  The skin on my chest was pebble like and I hated it.  This product has removed that look. That took over a week to change, but wow I can wear lower cut tops now and my skin is radiant!  My hands were looking rough.  My knuckles were so dry even lotion did not help.  I use this on my hands every night, remove with a microdermabrasion product then apply a thick lotion.  Finally my hands look very nice.  I have stocked up on this product, I never want to run out.  I also use the eye treatment, spray toner (use throughout the day to freshen up makeup), body polish and body creams. Sometimes I can get lucky and find this product line in stores; but not very often.  Finally a product line that works!

review/text: I don't know how I will ever use any other face wash ever again! This cleanser is amazing! It's very light but very effective at removing my makeup (I wear Bare Minerals). Unlike other cleansers, my skin doesn't feel dry and tight after I rinse. Instead, it feels soft and moisturized so I know it's not stripping my own natural oils.<br /><br />The cleanser is clear, with a fantastic scent, that works up into a rich lather. I have not tried the Pineapple Scrub, but when I want some exfoliation, I lather up my face with the cleanser and dab on some plain white table sugar. After some gentle massage, I wash everything off and my skin feels great!<br /><br />I have combo skin with acne around the chin and cheeks and this cleanser never hurts, stings, or irritates my blemishes (unlike a lot of other products). Since my acne is mainly from resting my chin/cheeks on my hands, until that habit stops I will always have breakouts. Luckily, this cleanser works so well and now that my skin feels so good, I don't want to touch my face anymore!

review/text: I bought this because exfoliants with small granules were too rough on my dry skin. I got a professional facial to help with my dry skin and they recommended a fruit enzyme peel that will dissolve dry skin without being so rough. Of course they wanted me to purchase an incredibly expensive product, but I decided to do some looking on my own. I settled on this product and have been very pleased. I can use it daily without it being too harsh on my skin and it dissolves all flaky, dry skin on my face. Even using it daily or every other day, the product has lasted a while (bought it in mid-August and still going here at Thanksgiving). It smells pleasant and feels soothing on my skin. Also, I think that Amazon had this listed as a liquid, but in reality it's a thick gel.

review/summary: Amazing product for what you pay for it.....
review/text: I've used this product considerably since I've moved to a different climate.  In this climate I break out along my t-zone, which I never had an issue before, but using this product enables me to help minimize and control the breakouts.  I also notice that this product helps fade away old acne scars.. not completely, but it does help minimize the appearance.  I have combo skin, therefore I only dab it on the affected or broken out areas rather than putting it all over my face because I noticed it did dry out my dry areas.  I also use it everyday on the affected areas without any issues.  I can't answer in terms of pores, but I do feel like the next morning after applying this product my skin tone looks more even.

review/text: SO disappointed! I have oily, mild acne prone, sensitive, combo skin. This product DID NOT absorb into my skin AT ALL. It sat on top of my skin creating a 'slippery' greasy layer. Eww. After about 30 minutes, my skin was extremely oily, shiny & greasy looking. It looked and felt like baby oil on my face! I have oily skin but this product brought MORE excessive oil onto my face even in areas where I normally don't get oily. I don't understand how this is a oil-free moisturizer but yet makes your skin extremely oily. Glad I was able to return it!

review/summary: Burns Sensitive Skin
review/text: I bought this product because I was looking for something more natural for my sensitive skin.  Says its "gentle for all skin types" but it's not.  Literally 2 seconds after I put the first dab on my face it started burning. I could see my skin turning red and getting a rash under it.  I had to wash it off immediately.  The spot that had it does feel softer than the rest of my face, but the burning and rash is SO not worth it.  My second complaint is that it's a gel mask versus a clay mask.  I should have read the ingredients better for that one though.

review/summary: My best beauty secret!
review/text: I love this product.  I have sensitive skin, & this is really gentle & soothing.  I also try to avoid wearing foundation, but this moisturizer wears well under Physician's Formula Organic Wear Foundation.  (I haven't tried it with any other foundation products).  I exfoliate every other day & apply this afterward, as well as after getting out of the shower.  The fragrance isn't too strong, and I love that its oil free, because I have extremely oily skin.  (I obviously wash my face on a regular basis as well in addition to exfoliating.)  This is a hard product to review because people's needs, opinions, & skin types are so different.  I was initially hesitant to pay so much for it, but in comparison to other oil free moisturizers, this one is about the same cost, & isn't full of harsh chemicals, fillers, & other crap that clogs your pores up.  Just my two cents.

review/text: I've been using this face mask for years. It is much cheaper buying it online than at your local drugstore. I use it about twice a week on my entire face, but almost daily just under my eyes. I apply it there when I wake up, pre-shower. It does a nice job of tightening the baggy skin under my eyes. It's not surgery so the effect doesn't last forever but it does help. I've had no adverse reactions from using Alba Botanica Papaya Enzyme facial mask.

review/summary: Oily dilemma...
review/text: I have a very hard time finding a moisterizer.  I have a very oily t-zone while the rest of my face is dry to the point of flakey.  A word of caution if you already have oily prone skin... This created more oil.  I only used it at night and when I woke the next morning I was shoked at the sheen of oil covering my entire face.  I was disgusted.  Granted, it didn't appear to clog pores, nor make my acne worse (I am an unfortunate sufferer of that infamous adult acne around the mouth and chin area).<br /><br />A nice thing about this moisterizer is it was extremely refreshing after applying.  Especially those nights following a toner that can sometimes leave that sting behind.  I love the smell of it too.  I have since switched to only applying it outside of my t-zone, and while I still discover oil the next morning, it isn't near as bad as before.<br /><br />I am on the hunt for a new moisterizer, as I probably won't continue to use this.  Unfortunately there just aren't a lot of moisterizers with green tea, which is what I was looking for.

review/summary: Long lasting lip balm
review/text: I've been using blistex for decades, burts bees for years and I just found this in the organic section at wal mart.  I like coconut and decided to give this a try.<br />Seriously, in my pockets always are my wallet, keys and lip balm.  I've worked outdoors for years and depend upon it's protection from the elements.  Blistex is fine, but I wanted something more organic, Burts Bees is great, but I don't like their tube as much 'cause sometimes I keep this in my bra (when I don't have pockets)and it's scratchy and the peppermint is annoying at times.  (I have yet to try the others)<br />But this Coconut Cream lip balm is really amazing.  It last for a really really long time.  I put it on before bedtime and in the morning there's still some on my lips, protecting and smoothing them.  I like the feel and the flavor and will be purchasing this product for many years to come now that I have discovered it!  Invest the 3 bucks and see for yourself if it isn't better than what you're using.

review/summary: I always come back to this product
review/text: I have really sensitive skin; it reacts poorly to almost everything (including hard water), it is dry in spots and oily in others, and it definitely sees a blemish from time to time. I've tried just about every product out there because I am easily swayed by advertisements for new organic facial products, but I always come back to this line. Unlike most products for 'troubled' skin, which contain harsh salicycle acid, this product doesn't make my break-outs worse at all. It's oil free, so even after a long day my nose doesn't feel slick, and it's nice and light so it goes great under make-up. The scent is fantastic and a little jar goes a long way because you need so little of it. If your skin is like mine, I recommend the pineapple enzyme cleanser, the habiscus toner, the papaya mask, and this moisturizer. That regiment keeps me clear, soft, and smelling like the tropics. The only thing I don't use is the eye gel, which is a bit too light for the eye area.

review/summary: Deep Cleansing Fruity Face Scrub
review/text: Alba's Pineapple Enzyme Facial Scrub is deliciously pineapple with hints of orange juice and dreams of coconut drinks on beaches somewhere very far from home. The tropical escape factor is very present all while the scrub works overtime to remove dull surface cells. Lavender, Aloe, Jojoba, Pineapple, Papaya, Awapuhi, Bromelain and Vitamin E are the base for this creamy cleanser enhanced with a botanical fragrance. The exfoliating granules are very mild and the aloe makes this extra soothing. After one use you can see results in tone/texture and moisture balance, after three uses, you may find yourself ordering a second tube. It is that impressive. Looking forward to trying the travel kit because the products have amazing summery scents that remind me of warm days at the beach.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Not for Sensitive Skin - Read Ingredients First
review/text: I love the Alba products because they contain lots of natural ingredients and are a great value for the price, plus I've always had good resutls with them.  I use the sea kelp products and really like them but decided to try something different for the summer, so I ordered the Jasmine moisturizer and the hibiscus facial toner.  The jasmine cream is wonderful and works great on my dry skin but, unfortunately, the hibiscus facial toner caused severe burning to my skin. After I read the entire ingredient listing, I was shocked to find this toner contains sodium hydroxide which is used in such harsh cleaning products as oven and drain cleaners.  I do have sensitive skin which, I am certain, caused the reaction.  I don't think this product is for sensitive skin, but be sure to read the entire ingredient list before you decide to purchase it, and if possible, try a sample of it first.  I went back to the sea kelp facial toner and have had no further problems.

review/summary: Great Moisturizer, Overpowered by Scent
review/text: This product moisturizes very nicely. It goes on very smooth and stays on for awhile. I really wanted to love this cream, but the smell is just so overpowering. I was expecting a soft, light scent, but this is just so strong and overpowering that it almost makes you dizzy. The smell does not diminish the longer you wear it; I put the cream on before bed, and woke up the next morning smelling like I had just put it on. It's very unfortunate, in my opinion the smell makes the cream unwearable.

review/summary: WOW
review/text: I actually ended up buying this from walmart because I was in need of an oil free moisturizer for my face...BADLY and didn't want to way 4-5 days for my order to process on here. So I purchased it (and I cringed at the thought of spending 15 bucks on a small container of moisturizer), and applied it to my clean face in the morning and before bed. Let me tell you...<br /><br />THIS THING ZAPPED MY PIMPLES LIKE NO TOMORROW!!!<br /><br />Not only did it feel nice and silky on my face, and it soaked in, but it just cleared my face up! I was so surprised. I thought it was too good to be true and maybe it happened to be one of those days that my skin decided to clear uyp on it's own. But no, I was wrong... and thank goodness. I continued using the moisturizer twice a day for a week and my face just stayed clear for the entire week. I was so happy!<br /><br />This stuff is definitely worth the money, and it WILL last you quite a long time since a little DOES go a long way. How little you ask? Just lightly, and quickly tap your finger onto the surface of the moisturizer and that's all you'll really need!<br /><br />Five stars, baby. FIVE STARS!

review/text: I like this moisture cream a lot. It feels great on my face and the Jasmine scent is so pleasant. The ingredients are all good too. I don't use chemcial laden products and Alba makes great natural products. Alba makes several moisture creams in other scents, but the Jasmine is my absolute favorite and I'll continue to purchase this one. My husband likes the scent a lot too.

review/summary: Mixed feelings...
review/text: I originally tried this product because the "oil-free" caught my eye.<br />Having an acne prone skin, I thought this moisturizer would be perfect!<br />But after using this product a few times I noticed a few things...<br />CONS:<br />  -This product doesn't sink into your skin but rather stays on top and leaves your skin feeling oily and greasy.<br />  -My acne continued to break out, even more! :(<br />PROS:<br />  -Made my skin feel softer :)<br />  -Very long lasting, don't let the 3oz fool you!<br /><br />OVERALL: I stopped using this product after using about 1/4 of it. But hey, everyone has a different type of skin.<br />  If you feel that this moisturizer might be the one for you, go on and try it!

review/text: Finally a product in a price range that I can say WoW about!If your looking for a product that delivers positive results that isnt 80 to 100$, I swear this is it. I have combo skin and some light scars around mouth/chin area from acne. The results Ive had from using this is diminished scars (not erased scars), clearer skin. It keeps there appearance down. However this product is mild if your just starting masks or have perfect skin already...recommended.

review/text: Love this product because I have rosecea on one side of my face and it is gentle enough for that buut strong enough to get rid of any remaining traces of makeup or oil, leaving a nice fresh feeling on the skin. Along with the price being very reasonable, you only use a little on a pad so the product goes a long way.

review/text: I purchased this product to use during a weight loss program, to eliminate unnessary oils in my body. I am very happy with this alba oil-free moisturizer. At my age "over 50" I wondered how well a moisturizer without oil would work. Surprisingly well. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I used it a few times as a body lotion as well; until I found something more practical.

review/summary: Great cleanser...but watch the eyes!
review/text: I have very sensetive skin (and very hard water!) so it's hard for me to find a cleanser that doesn't irritate or dry out my skin. Albas Pinapple face wash is gentle, cleans my face very well and has a wonderful, refreshing pineapple scent to it. A small amount worked into a lather in your hands will do the job. Why only 4 stars? It's VERY thick and needs a little extra time to wash off. I've opened my eyes in the shower a few times thinking this was rinsed clean only to find excess pineapple enzyme wash in my eyes...and it stings! This is the only face wash I've used like that which is very odd. I attribute it to its thick texture and the fact that I have very hard water. Be careful with this! Make sure it's rinsed really really well before you open up your eyeballs. Other than that, it's a great product and my favorite facial cleanser :)

review/summary: Green Tea Moisturizer
review/text: Feels great on my skin. The only thing about it that bothers me at all is the smell. It's not a bad smell and it's not that strong but I'm pretty sensitive to scents. It probably wouldn't bother most people at all but you might want to be aware if you have allergies or are really sensitive to smells.  I only mention it because I suffer from migraines and scents can be a trigger for me. The product works wonderful for my skin and I love the way green tea makes my skin feel so refreshed.

review/summary: Alba face cream
review/text: I have always like Alba brand products from the standpoint that they use plant-based ingredients which are far better for the skin than the other more expensive brands found at Macy's and the like. One only needs to use about a peas-size for the face as it can be a bit oily. Overall, it's a good product that I can use right before applying my make-up and use again after washing my face. This jar will last me quite awhile, so I can appreciate that. Pleasant smell too, not overwhelming with fragrance like most facial creams.

review/summary: the best lip balm on the market hands down
review/text: I love this lip balm and have been using it for around 10 years. It is the only lip balm that thoroughly quenches my dry lips and doesnt taste like soap! Inevitably some lip balm is going to get inside the mouth when using it, and this is fine as it tastes like coconut which I love! Not only that but the ingredients are safe - its not loaded up with chemicals like most.  Its the perfect lip balm and I hope it never gets discontinued.... I simply cant go without it, and have never found a lip balm as awesome as this one!

review/summary: It's alright
review/text: It smells nice, and has a thick consistency, but rather than call it a scrub, I'd call it a cleanser ; the particles meant to be scrubbing your face aren't big enough to do much scrubbing; if you want a very,very,very gentle scrub then this may be for you, but for those of you who have used the St.Ives Apricot scrub, and want something more effective then you should look elsewhere. On the plus side, it is partially organic, and natural, and as I mentioned earlier it smells nice. I just saw a review about how it smelled like rotten pineapples, and how it caused a pimple outbreak on the reviewer-I'm guessing it was either expired, or had gone bad so don't let that scare you away from trying it-you might like it. As for me,I need something with bigger particles so maybe I'll just do a homemade scrub with sugar-or better yet, I can add a little sugar to the scrub to make it more effective. Oh, and before I forget, my face did look a little brighter after I used the scrub. It isn't allthat bad, but it's just not what I was looking for in a scrub.

review/summary: Delicious Organic French Roast
review/text: Cafe Altura makes a very good French Roast organic coffee. It is different than Intelligentsia with a bit more bite to the roast. It took me a bit of getting used to, but once I did, I grew to like it.<br /><br />Cafe Altura gets this coffee from "small family owned farms from around the world." They state on the can, "Cafe Altura buys from the same farms each year to insure the integrity and quality of our coffees."<br /><br />This particular coffee is air roasted, not drum roasted. I do not know if that accounts for the difference that I taste in flavor, or if it is the origin of the beans.<br /><br />I would order this coffee again.

The cups fit securely in the holder and do not have to worry about them falling out of place. It is semi expensive for an item that holds just a few k-cups but it makes life very easy and convenient and brings some style next to your coffee maker. Why have a $200 luxury coffee maker only to throw cups all over the counter?

review/text: I was worried about this red because there are two Keurig reds, cinnamon (the new big Keurig) and the bright red (single cup).  Mine is black but I wanted a bright red carousel to match my kitchen.  I think this red works well with either color.  It is kind of a cross between the two and will coordinate well with either red.<br /><br />The lazy susan is great, very smooth and balanced.  The opening in the top holds my eko-brew packets well also.<br /><br />I know I purchased a two tier product and I got exactly what I was hoping for.  However, I do wish that Nifty would make a red in the three tier version.
