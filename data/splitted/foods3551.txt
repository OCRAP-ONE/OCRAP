review/summary: Better than any US candy anyday
review/text: I grew up with Maynards wine gums in England, so sure I am a bit biased simply because these sweets hold a lot of childhood charm. But I tried them again when visiting Canada--after having lived in the US for several years--and one taste and I was a complete gonner. They are so flavorful, and at the same time not overly sweet. They are delicious, but do not have they bland sugary taste that American gummi candies have. I now buy them in bulk and hate to be without them.

review/summary: Not really s'mores, but kids love it
review/text: My children picked out Smorz at the grocery store.  It's not my first choice, as I can tell it is obviously very sweet.  I think that's the selling point.  It actually tastes sweeter than the amount of sugar it contains -- 13 grams per 1 cup serving.  Yes, that's sweet, but I've seen cereals with more than that.<br /><br />I don't think it tastes like s'mores at all, just generic sweet chocolaty cereal with dehydrated marshmallows.  Not bad at all, but I can't have too much for all the sweetness.<br /><br />My kids like it and I don't object too much.  At least it's fortified.

review/summary: Expensive way to get products you miss
review/text: Working overseas for the Military has its rewards, but it also has its disadvantages.  The PX system tends to provide the basic items for purchase and so after a while you simply get tired of eating the same thing over and over and over.  So you go online to purchase those items that you remember loving to eat.<br /><br />And so I went looking for Kellogg's Smorz Cereal and had no problem finding it.  But wow, $7.50 per box by the time you get through with shipping.<br /><br />Still the product arrived within the time promised and the product was in good condition, so I rate this a 4 stars based on the condition of the product and the fact that it did not arrive late.  This loses one star because of the high price.

review/text: This cereal is in the top five of all time best cereals. However, $18.36 for 4, 10.5oz boxes is a total rip-off. I've never seen these on sale.....yet, and I've written to Kellogs requesting coupons after gushing to them how great this cereal is, but they told me no. I still buy it because it's one of the best, just not as often as I would with a coupon. You can get these from the supermarket for about $3.59 for a 10.5oz box.

review/summary: Reminiscent of S'mores, by no means perfect execution
review/text: I am a S'more addict, so when I saw this cereal, I HAD to get it. And I was excited to say the least.<br /><br />Until I tasted it.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong--it's definitely tasty...but it's just not what I wanted it to be. The "graham" pieces are air-puffed pieces that don't really taste much like graham crackers--this cereal would have been MUCH better off with graham pieces &agrave; la Golden Grahams (except that's another company so I am sure there was some reason they couldn't). The marshmallow ratio was nice--always my favorite part of a breakfast cereal! And it was okay in milk--but I'll probably just eat it dry from now on.<br /><br />So, overall, it tasted vaguely of S'mores...but had I been blindfolded, I probably wouldn't have been able to guess what it was. I would still eat it, of course. :) And I do plan to enjoy the rest of my four boxes.

review/summary: Disturbingly Good!
review/text: I think it is absolutely outrageous that Kellogg's refuse to market this product properly! It's probably the least known cereal, I have never seen it in a store (other than perhaps Lions in the Baltimore area), and even on their website Kellogg's say I can only get it at nearby Wallmarts. No need to mention that those Wallmarts never have it in stock...<br /><br />This is the most flavorful cereal ever made! The flavors are amazing, the marshmallows to cereal ratio is perfect, and the chocolate flavor is in the right intensity.<br /><br />I actually eat this cereal as dessert after dinner!<br /><br />Only one problem: The packages are too small. And I'm not just saying this because I always want more (and I do), I am saying this objectively: Most cereal boxes average 15 Oz. (or at least offer a 15 oz option other than a smaller one). This cereal comes only in the 10.4 Oz. - that's 30% smaller!!! What a shame...

review/text: Kellogg's Smorz is the best product for someone who likes chocolate flavor ... It is slightly chocolatey & the marshmallow bits in the middle just add to the taste. It is not overtly sugar sweet, and just the right balance between crunchy and not so crunchy (thanks to the marshma... bits). If you hate sweet... don't try it....<br /><br />I love it so much, have a recurring order set up so that I get my regular supply. This is very difficult to find in the stores, coz' it gets picked up very quickly.<br /><br />Kellogg's Smorz, 10.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)

review/text: I'm just learning of the problems with grains and cerals in our diets, but this also has lots of sugar. No surprise there given most cereals do. Perhaps if this had an actual graham cracker taste I think the cereal could justify the sugar if your family doesn't overdo the eating of it.

review/summary: Sickly Sweet Cereal w/ Consistency of a a Cheeto
review/text: I'm a big fan of Captain Crunch, Cocoa Krispies, Cocoa Puffs, Golden Grahams, and so on and when I read the reviews that this was 'the best cereal ever' I had to try it. Luckily my local Wal-Mart had this cereal on the shelves for $2 a box (I bought 3 boxes based on the reviews.)  Well all I can say is this cereal is terrible. Its super super sweet and the main grain puff (its a square light brown puff) that has the consistency of a hard Cheeto (the cheese snack).  The little chocolate marshmallows are good but the main component of the cereal, those grain puffs, are not to my taste. I can honestly say this is one of the worst cereals I've ever tasted.

review/summary: Vegan-rific!
review/text: The most amazing corn-syrup free, vegan gummies out there.  A perfect balance of sweet and sour, all in a bite-sized treat.  I highly recommend these smaller packages over the larger ones, as there is no way that you will be able to stop yourself from eating the whole pack! Each package is only 80 calories, and serves up 60% of your daily Vitamin requirement. There is 14g of sugar (7% / 20g of your total carbohydrates) in each packet, so you might want to have someone hide the box so you don't over-indulge. The only downside is that the texture can sometimes be a little bit soft (which makes sense since there is no gelatin) but this is easily rectified by sticking the candies in the fridge.  So delicious!

review/summary: Vegetarian Gummies - Yea!
review/text: As a vegetarian, one of the few things I hated giving up was gelatin products.  It's amazing how many foods have it in it, some really surprising.  Gummy candies are almost always made with it and generally they're full of artificial colors and artificial flavors as  well - both things I avoid at all costs!  These have none of those cruddy ingredients and best of all, they're delicious!  I gave my meat-eating, vegetarian-scoffing son some and didn't tell him they were vegetarian.  He LOVED them and refused to believe me that they didn't have all that junk until I ate them.  That shut him up fast!<br /><br />We both love them although he'll never admit it!

review/text: I started eating this back in the 50's and still love it. I heat it up until it is boiling hot. I have never put it over anything; but, I bet it is great over toast or biscuits. Apparently one thing I have noticed is also noticed by others.  The cans that shake "soupy" taste better than the cans that don't.  I shake every can at the store to find those. The gravy is more liquid and there is more chicken in those cans. The other cans without the "soupy" sound have thicker gravy and less chicken as a rule. A clerk at Walmart saw me doing this and asked me why I do it. She said she has seen a lot of other people shaking the Chicken a la King cans and wondered why. The only place I can find it locally now is at Walmart. I have eaten this since the 1950's and hope I never have to give it up. For me, it truly is a comfort food.

review/summary: No refrigeration required
review/text: My husband would never eat natural peanut butter, but he wanted to try it--again. His complaint about natural peanut butters was that they separate and he doesn't like keeping them in the refrigerator because they get too hard and tear the bread when you spread them. A few weeks ago, we tried Krema. After mixing the oil in, we just leave it in the cupboard. Even though it's been a really hot summer, it stays together. Of course, it's not around that long. We eat a jar a week! It's so finely ground, it's almost as if they used a chocolate conching machine to grind it. They actually have several varieties, including a hot and spicy peanut butter which I look forward to trying. I've only tried the cruncy kind. It is good stuff. Now if only I can talk them into making an organic variety, I think I will have figured out the one food I would want with me if I were ever stranded on a desert island...

review/text: I found this to be the absolute best Peanut Butter I've tasted.  No comparison.<br />You will have to stir your peanut butter as it settles and oil moves to the top.<br />I buy two at a time.  Turn them over and let settling occur at the bottom, then stir.<br /><br />My hint is to keep it in the Refrigerator after mixing...not necessary but useful to me.<br /><br />The roasted flavor is like no other.  Good to the last spoonful.<br />I found the product is half the cost at my grocer.  I came looking for case pricing,<br />but still found it cheapest at the grocer.

review/summary: nice naturally colored jimmies
review/text: We had been buying these jimmies and nonpareils for a while, then the company rolled out their organic non-pareils and the colors on the organic version are worthless, but now that is all our local natural foods store carries.  I was fortunate enough to find these jimmies at Whole Foods while traveling out of state and was happy see some color!  The only other company to sell natural colored sprinkles is India Tree, and they recently cut way back on the colors they offer in non-pareils, and in the past the did not offer natural colored jimmies though those are soon to be available.  I want to note though that the green is a yucky yellow green, not very appealing.  The other colors are fine and are a dark pink, a light pink, white, and yellow.  I gave these only 4 out of 5 stars instead of a 5 star rating because of the poor green, very little variety in color, and a high retail cost of $1.79 per ounce.

review/text: If you are expecting Walkers shortbread then these will be a disappointment. But I have been enjoying these for a couple of years now and really like them.  If you are following a wheat free and sugar free diet but want a little something sweet, then these fit the bill - for me at least.  I have tried all of the Pamela's cookies and I like these the best -  in fact, sometimes I crave them and go out of my way to get them!

The size was good but I knew I was going to have a problem when they were baked around the outside but more than half of the cookies middles are raw.  I'm going to put one in the oven and see if I can finish baking them.  Just so you don't do the dah thing don't put it in the microwave for 2 minutes your smoke alarms will go off!!!  This may have been just a batch missed and I will see as I have a case to go thru!  Happy eating!!

review/summary: Not the best of Pamela's brand
review/text: I ordered the Pamela's Butter Shortbread because I have tried a few varieties of Pamela's cookies and been very impressed. Upon opening the package I was quickly let down. The plastic container that the cookies are in is much bigger than the cookies themselves. It looks as if they have somehow shrunk up! These cookies are very crumbly (maybe the agave in them?) so you need to have a napkin near when eating them. Taste-wise they are good. They don't have any strange "gluten free flour" taste which is a definite plus. They did seem a bit too sugary for me though. It felt like my throat was burning because of the sugar (again, maybe this is because the agave).<br /><br />If you really need a cookie fix and no other gluten free cookies are near then these are worth a try. If you are able to get your hands on any other Pamela cookies though then steer clear of these.

review/summary: Yummy, smooth, buttery
review/text: I've gone through several boxes of Tully's Kona K-Cups. I've bought them both here on Amazon and at my local Tully's. They're exactly the same coffee, but buying through Amazon saves you a ton of money.<br /><br />This coffee is a great medium blend. Not too harsh, not too much acid. There is a very buttery smooth taste to this coffee. Great almost any time of day. If you need harsh Alien-blood style coffee to wake up, this isn't for you... try Black Tiger.Coffee People K-Cups, Black Tiger Extra Bold This stuff can wake the dead and probably burn through the hull of a spacecraft.<br /><br />Note that this coffee is not 100% pure Kona. It is a blend. That means that the coffee purists out there may have huge expectations. I think it has a great Kona flavor, but if you're looking for that truly authentic stuff, go spend the money and get it.<br /><br />I tend to use the medium cup size with this coffee and my Keurig B60 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQSMPO">Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a> and I get a great cup, not weak or strong, and just the right size to get me through the morning email or the morning commute.<br /><br />Buy a box. You'll either like it or love it.

review/summary: SerendipiTea Hibiscus Tisane
review/text: I'm not going to get into the quality of this product. I am going write about the deceptive selling practice. The Amazon title and description for the product indicates the product contains two 4-ounce packages. The picture shows a box with a content net weight of 4 oz. (112g). What I received is a 2-pack with each package containing 3-ounces. I would not have noticed this except that some one had hand-written a "3" over the 4 on the package. So I got 25% less product than clearly advertised. I would think that if some one knows and takes the time to correct the packaging, they would also correct the Amazon listing. I'm not a happy customer.

review/text: We love this product. It is great tasting & I use it in my oatmeal for breakfast & on my toast instead of butter. Our eggs have better flavor as well as anything else that you would normaly use an oil product in or on. I now use this instead of the extra virgin olive oil that used to be my standard. Just knowing that it is a healthy alternative for my heart is a big plus. People might look at the fat content & think it is a bad thing but, I have lost over 100 lbs in the past 2 yrs & I use NUTIVA coconut oil everyday. I have at least a Tbs in my oatmeal alone. love it, Love It, LOVE IT! If you think you wouldn't mind the mild taste of coconut, try it. I think you might really be surprised at how good everything tastes with this in it.

review/summary: Wonderful super healthy oil
review/text: I added coconut oil (CO) to my daily menu about a year ago. There are so many health benefits to CO it is a miracle that you don't have to have a prescription to buy it.<br /><br />Google 'coconut oil health benefits' and prepare to be floored by this amazing natural boon to mankind. No kidding. From just one sentence of one of those pages: Coconut oil is antiviral, antifungal (kills yeast too) and antibacterial.<br /><br />It is incredible both topically and orally. I use it as a pre-shave lotion. I put a few drops on my tooth-brush before putting the toothpaste on. I use it as a hand lotion.<br /><br />Most organic EV CO taste like coconut to some degree and usually strongly. Nutiva OEVCO certainly does have a coconut taste. So, cooking most foods in it is yukky. But there are many ways to get CO into your daily routine. Eating a T straight up is like a 5 hr energy shot. Put it in your coffee (takes some getting used to but I do 4T every morning like that). Make 'coconut oil bark' - google it. There are more tasteless versions you can use for cooking. I use the refined pure CO from LouAnn brand for cooking just about everything.<br /><br />CO encourages fat burning.<br /><br />A word of caution. When you first start supplementing with CO go slowly. Because of the anti-allBadThings nature of CO it will upset your stomach, because it kills off gut flora in droves, if you zap yourself with, say, a full tablespoon right off the bat. It'll make you feel nauseous and bathroom bound for one or more hours. Start with .5 or 1 teaspoon and spend a week working your way up to 1+ tablespoons.<br /><br />A word about Nutiva and Amazon. Excellent! If you do sub and save, this 2 pack is an amazing value delivered right to your door. I've bought the two pack 8 or 10 times and only once had any hint of oil in the box and the two jugs were still sealed.<br /><br />If you are new to the world of organic CO then you should buy a small amount first. Some people are actually allergic to it. And some people just don't like it. Don't buy a 55 gallon drum of it and then find out it is awful for you. You can get organic CO at any health food store (for an arm and a leg) and Wal-Mart carries it in their pharmacy area. Or buy the Nutiva here at Amazon in a small amount.<br /><br />But, do yourself a favor and try it.<br /><br />If you are eating the healthiest way known to man - low carb - and you aren't already eating CO then order some right now.

review/text: I love this product, it smells and tastes so good. I use it regularly every day. I use it in my foods, and on my skin.  It is great for healing too. I work outside in the hot sun most days in my yard, before I go out I put Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil all over my exposed skin. It really protects my skin from burning and I do not turn red after being out in the sun for several hours. My body inside and out feels so healthy. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to speak my praises.

It doesn't have a strong coconut taste so when I want more coconut flavor, I use Jarrows instead.  That being said, the quality of Nutiva EVCO is outstanding.

review/summary: Many uses for coconut oil
review/text: I purchased this product as a supplement for my dogs.  One dog has severe skin allergies and was prescribed steroids by the vet.  I didn't like giving him steroids because of the long term health effects...and they made him cranky.  I started researching holistic solutions and read several reviews on the benefits of coconut oil in curing skin allergies.  It was worth a try.  On the positive side, they absolutely LOVE the coconut oil.  Both dogs weigh over 60# so I drizzle 3 TBSP over their dry kibble two times per day.  On the less positive side, it has been three weeks and I have not noticed any improvement with the itching and scratching. I have enough for another five weeks so I will continue use and see if it helps.  If not, I know they have received other healthy benefits from the coconut oil.  If anyone else is considering this as a supplement for pets, one word of caution. Start in smaller quantities and gradually ease it into the diet to let their systems get used to it.  Otherwise, there may be some upleasant side effects &lt;wink, wink>.<br /><br />I have also started using it in my own cooking and enjoy the nutty flavor it adds to my food.  It adds enough flavor that I can keep recipes simple.  One of my favorites is tilapia or chicken tenderloins sauteed in the coconut oil, a little salt and pepper, and a few chopped pecans added at the last minute.  Very tasty but, most importantly, a very simple and quick meal for a busy week night.  I can't wait to try it in coconut cupcakes!

I've tried a couple other coconut oils and this one is the best tasting so far. Whenever I cook with it I usually end up sneaking a spoonful straight in my mouth because it's so good and because it's so good for me. Lots of good fats that many people don't get in an every day diet.

review/text: This is a great brand.  I did my research and purchased my first batch through a retail outlet.  Then, I ran into a good deal on Amazon and re-ordered here.  If you're going to do coconut oil, it has to be Organic Extra Virgin to reap the benefits, and of course it has to taste good.  Check.  Check.  And when I accidentally drip some on my hands while pouring, I just rub it in for  moisturizing.  Good stuff.  Prompt delivery, too.

review/summary: WOW, This stuff is good
review/text: I've been buying coconut oil in the store for a few years and decided to order this because it was a little cheaper than the cans at the local supermarket.  The first thing I noticed was the smell.  This smelled like a pastry shop when I opened it.  Kind of nutty, yet sweet and with a hint of coconut.  Not like the other stuff I've bought that just smells like a bag of shredded coconut.  I couldn't help but grab a spoon and try some.  It is truely awesome.  I've really only used coconut oil for cooking before but now i'm putting it on bread and eating it like butter.  I'm not sure what the difference is but this was WAY better than the stuff i've been buying.

review/text: For several years we have been using Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil for it's health benefits. We found that Nutiva was what we thought was one of the better tasting brands. We use it to add good fat to fruit smoothies, scramble eggs, soups and vegetables.  It makes a great face cream, some people say it is better than the $100 cream. Never had the $100 cream, so I can't really compare. My son and I subscribed to get this delivered to us monthly and have been pleased.

review/text: Having become a fan of all things coconut (sugar, oil, water), I decided I could handle a larger amount of the oil(although I did share one with a friend). This is a high quality product and well worth the reasonable price paid. I have read, from many sources, that coconut oil is the healthiest for cooking and have been using it exclusively for months now (the olive oil is saved for cold dishes that require no heating....it's a chemistry thing). I use it on my hair to moisturize and control humidity frizz ( and I have fine hair, but it doesn't weigh it down. It takes just a drop warmed in your palm). Very light and no bad aroma. Wonderful as a skin moisturizer as well. With all it's versatility, I will be a repeat customer!

In the Dominican Republic my ancestors use coconut oil for all thing imaginable, from cooking to healing. Great product

review/text: This was the first brand of CO I had ever tried. It has been two years now since I started using CO instead of other oils for cooking. If the recipe calls for any other oil...this is what I use in place of it. I use it in place of butter for toast, oatmeal, or on a bagle (if I even have them anymore) I put it in my coffee and tea. I have tried other brands and for me this has the best taste. Can't beat the price when buying larger sizes on the Subscribe and save! Also just got my 1st bag of chai seeds. I will probably be getting that on sub & save too!<br />Of course I use the CO for hair treatment, skin/sun protection.<br />Nutiva Coconut Oil ROCKS

I use a sugar cookie dough base recipe but I replace maple syrup sugar and wheat flour for white flour and make a healthy cookie, muffin, doughnut, etc. I can also add chocolate or ginger depending on what I'm in the mood for. Anyways, check it out and use it! You won't be sorry that you did. :)!!

My mom gets one and I get one. It's perfect! I also like that auto-ship is available too. It makes things so much more convenient.<br /><br />I use the oil regularly: for food consumption, "oil pulling" (pulls toxins while you do a 20-minute swish every morning before you eat), teeth whiting, and moisturizer.<br /><br />LOVE IT!

review/summary: I am now a coco - Nut
review/text: I had read on the net about the benefits of coconut oil and decided to try some.  Since this product had a nice long shelf life and would not go rancid, I ordered a 54 oz container.  I thought I might use it up before the 2 year expiration date.  After ordering and receiving my oil, my husband and I fell in luv with this product.  We now use it for everything!!  We eat it, we cook with it, we put it in our coffee, we use it on our bodies and on our hair and give it to our dogs as a treat and they love it.  The container was empty after a month so I reordered the 2 pack of the 54 oz and put it on subscribe and save.  This was a great option as we can continue with our coconut oil frenzy and save money.  I know this will sound weird, but my husband gets oil cysts on his head from time to time and usually has a doctor cut them off and I have had a small oil "bump" at the edge of my lip.  After using coconut oil on our skin and hair, his latest cyst has almost disappeared and my bump is completely gone! Weird. The Nutiva coconut oil is the best.  It smells good, tastes great and as you can tell, we are very pleased with this product and I highly recommend it.
