review/summary: Meh
review/text: We got the twenty-four-piece multi-pack, which comes with four flavors: Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, Strawberry, and Sour Apple.<br /><br />The ingredients for the Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, and Strawberry are:<br />"organic apple puree, organic apple juice concentrate, organic flavor, pectin, colored with fruit and vegetable juice."  Also, some vitamins and minerals are added.<br /><br />Sour Apple ingredients are exactly the same, except there is no coloring added.<br /><br />The "organic flavor" ingredients are not specified, nor are the fruit and vegetable juices used for color.  We can assume that these ingredients do vary among the different flavored fruit ropes, but we don't know what they are.<br /><br />These fruit ropes do not have the fruit taste we thought they should.  Our family didn't like them very much.  They aren't terrible -- we just don't think they're good enough to purchase again; but maybe that's just because we're accustomed to natural foods.<br /><br />The ingredients aren't bad either, but they're nothing exciting -- as far as we can tell, they're just apple (pectin comes from apples) with anonymous color and flavor enhancers (and the supplemental vitamins and minerals).<br /><br />Additionally, among the Tropical Twist flavored fruit ropes were several that had not been packaged properly.  The ropes were sticking out the bottoms of the wrappers, having been squished along with the wrapper when the machinery pressure/heat sealed them.<br /><br />The reviewers who thought these were very chewy must have gotten stale ones.  The fresh ones are on the softer side, but still sticky.  (Braces wearers, beware.)<br /><br />For small, individually-wrapped dried fruit treats, I would recommend Stretch Island fruit leather instead.  These contain the fruits named in their flavors (e.g. the ingredients in Stretch Island's "orchard cherry" fruit leather are: apple puree concentrate, cherry puree concentrate, orange puree concentrate, natural black cherry flavor) and they taste like those fruits, too, without being too sweet or tart or sticky.

review/summary: Mmmmm, good!
review/text: This is a great tasting snack that you will never mind giving to your kids. Made out of organically raised fruit, they have lots of the right things (vitamin B & vitamin C) and none of the wrong things (no added sugars, no artificial colors, no preservatives). So, if you are a parent, and want some really good snacks that you will feel good about giving your children, then get Clif Kid Twisted Fruit Ropes. I highly recommend them!

review/summary: Great for kids with food Allergies
review/text: My son has multiple food allergies (soy, corn, wheat, walnuts, peanuts, dairy and sesame)  and the awesome things is that he can have these. It's so hard to find snacks for him and we went to a birthday party where somebody packed these in the goody bags.  We were surprised when we looked at the ingredients and found out he can actually eat them and doesn't have to feel left out while the other kids eat it.  The hardest ingredient to get away from in these type of snacks is high fructose corn syrup which this product doesn't contain.

review/summary: Whether you're grown or growing, this is the YUMMIEST fruit snack going!
review/text: I'm not exactly a kid (born December 5, 1967, you do the math)but I had to try these things when I saw them in my local natural-foods market, and they are PLENTY OF YUMMY. Sweet yet zingy, fruity-fresh flavor, firm but tender texture. Each twist "candy" is 70 calories and 1 point on Weight Watchers, and unlike conventional fruit snacks, these take some time to enjoy, so they're more satisfying. These are a snack to be savored. Now I'm hooked on the things. I tried the Tropical Twist and the Mixed Berry so far (I like to buy them individually, so I don't mow through the box in one sweep!) Both are delish, but the Tropical Twist is an eyelash ahead. Looking forward to trying the other flavors.<br />  I don't have kids yet, but I would recommend them to my little cousin-nieces (my cousin's daughters)<br />  These are great to take on the go. Just slip into pocket or purse.<br />  A fitness-friendly, tastebud-tantalizing way to slap your mouth sideways with a wallop of fruit!  I recommend them highly

review/summary: Tasty, like Kelis' album
review/text: Finally, a great tasting fruit snack without added Sugar and/or High Fructose Corn Syrup. Clif has released something tasty that I can eat without being the equivalent of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NT69XU">Snickers Bar</a>. It makes a great late night and on the go snack. While it's strawberry flavored (Yes, The review is based on the strawberry flavor), it doesn't taste a thing like strawberries. It tastes as artificial <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OIT8T2">Skittles</a> but it isn't artificial and that's a beautiful thing. And While non-strawberry tasting strawberry flavor (At least I didn't think it tasted like strawberry) may be a minus for some people, for me, a person who doesn't like the taste of real strawberry, that's a plus. The shape of the rope is just like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UHADL4">Red Vines</a> and if you've had the strawberry red vines, the taste isn't that much different. And for kids, if you remove the individual wrappers and place them in a Ziploc Bag, I doubt a child would be able to tell the difference to this and a piece of licorice. I placed a few in an empty <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UHADL4">Red Vines</a> bag, my 9 year old nephew got into them, didn't know the difference.<br /><br />PROS<br />1. Great for kids lunches or a late night snack<br />2. 70 calories<br />3. No Extra sugar and/or High Fructose corn syrup or artificial sweetner<br />4. Organic And All Natural<br />5. 100 percent fruit with great taste<br /><br />CONS<br />1. Not so big on the strawberry flavor.<br /><br />To sum it all up, If you're looking for a nutritious snack for your kids, This is perfect

review/summary: Great product but now has more sugar
review/text: I used to order these for my daughter and husband since they had 9 grams of sugar in them which is comparable to the fruit chews you buy in the store but without all of the colored dyes. Sad to discover in my last order that the sugar is now up to 15 grams per stick which is too much. I confirmed with CLIF and they said they raised the sugar because that is what the customers wanted so we no longer buy these now. Just a note for those watching how much sugar their kids are getting.

review/text: I bought these Cliff Kids Twisted Fruit Ropes for my son.  He did not care for them, but I (his Mother) love them.  They should take the word  "kid" off the label and leave them as just Clif Twisted Fruit Ropes!  They are conveniently packaged so that I can put one or two in my purse for when I need a quick, nutritional snack while on the go!  They are about the size of a pen and just slip right in my purse.  I buy these for me now.....not my kid.  These taste great!!!!

review/summary: Good Alternative to Candy
review/text: I have been eating Clif Bars for years now, so when I saw that they were making fruit snacks I had to give them a try.  Each stick is individual wrapped and has 70 calories all from Carbs, there is also a gram of Fiber, some Potassium and a few other vitamins and minerals for good measure, so compared to just 100% sugar candy, this is not too bad of a choice.  The sugar is also from Organic Juices so you don't have to worry about pesticides or preservatives or anything like that.<br /><br />As far as the taste, they are a little tart, but not too bad.  They are very chewy and sticky, one of my friends has braces and they had a very hard time eating this without most of it just sticking somewhere in the braces.  So all-in-all, I would recommend these if you like chewy fruit flavored candy and want something better, but you should still use them sparely because eating just carbs only gives a very short energy burst and then without any healthy fats or proteins you crash soon after, so have a handful of nuts or something similar to help balance out the components some.

review/text: I try to choose healthy snacks when I have the option, and I was pleased to see this brand available in a variety pack.  While these fruit snacks are easy to tote around and very good for you, the taste and texture missed the mark with me.  All of the flavor varieties were a bit too tough and chewy.  The green apple was tart enough to make my eyes water, but the other three flavors were fairly good.

review/summary: fruit candy great idea
review/text: I personally like the flavor of these twisted fruit sticks and more importantly my kids enjoy them also. (two and four years old). Basically these are like fruit roll ups with a heavy concentration of fruit juice that gives him a strong tart flavor. Their texture is similar to soft licorice in addition they throw in a few vitamins but not so many that you have to worry about toxicity. I also tried their mixed berry flavor and would definitely recommend strawberry.<br /><br />I feel adults can use these as a healthier candy or my kids can eat these with a lower probability of creating a mess that sometimes occurs with fruit roll up treats.

review/summary: Two reviews in one! ...  from a mom & her son
review/text: MOM'S REVIEW:<br />Fruit rope doesn't sound all that appealing. Twisted fruit sounds a little better. It really doesn't matter what these little twists of fruit are called because they are YUMMY! Upon opening the package, I found a dark dark red twisty fruit rope. It looks as if you took good fruit leather, and rolled them up and twisted them. They don't LOOK delicious which maybe makes that first bite taste even better. It has this sweet, tart, pure strawberry taste and a texture that reminds me a bit of al dente firmness of pasta but these are much thicker, of course.<br /><br />I like that there are less calories than a can of pop/soda or even orange juice, and has a full serving of fruit. It's low in sugar, too. Now, REAL strawberries are much better for you but on the go, or in a backpack, these are a pretty good choice.<br /><br />KID'S REVIEW:<br />They have an awesome taste. I would recommend these to everyone. The texture of them kinda isn't that appealing to me but once I took a bite I was hooked. I think they could have been made a little bigger but could be a great snack for football games, soccer games, tennis meets, etc. That's all.

One grandmother used to make homemade strawberry fruit roll-ups from dried strawberries (no sugar added, I don't think), and these snacks remind me very much of those.  I really like them, but if you are buying them for someone with a big sweet tooth, then they might not be as big of a hit.

review/text: I got the Sour Apple version of the Clif Kid Twisted fruit, and even though I'm not a "Kid" exactly, I still take these to work for lunch.  They do taste good.  The first two ingredients are Apple Puree and Apple Juice, and the rest of the ingredients are added vitamins & minerals (plus pectin and wax to give the juice and puree structure).  Yes I know, these are full of sugar - apple juice concentrate is another way of saying "sugar - apple flavored".  But as far as a sugary treat goes, this one at least has some vitamins and even a smidge of fiber hidden inside.  It's tasty and I get my candy craving out of the way.  It's mostly organic, so I don't have to worry about my treat putting pesticides into the environment.  Maybe a real apple is better for you, but this will do in a pinch.

review/summary: The grape are delicious
review/text: I tried these at the local food coop in New London CT (where you do not have to be a member to shop BTW!), eighty five cents ea. there. Great to satisfy a sweet tooth, no added sugar, very grape-y, sweet and tart. Didn't see any reviews mentioning the grape, so for the naysayers, try those before you write these off your shopping list!

review/summary: Fruit Ropes vs. Fruit Rolls
review/text: I was quite excited when I found these.  Organic, made of real fruit instead of sugar and high fructose corn syrup, and cheaper than the Fruitabu rolls that my girls had been eating.  These are great in concept, and the taste is great, but unfortunately, my daughters prefer to unroll fruit snacks, rather than just bite the end of fun twisty things.<br />I would -definitely- continue to buy them, if only my girls would eat them consistently.

review/summary: Not the most nutritious but better than others
review/text: I realize that these snacks sort of straddle the line between fruit and candy, but they are better than most "fruit roll-up" type snacks with all the added sugar. At least these ones have no added sugar and are mostly fruit.<br /><br />My kids like all four of the flavors in the multi-pack, including the Sour Apple which I had thought they would reject. I personally find it way too sour for me but they love it!<br /><br />These snacks are individually wrapped which makes them great for tossing in a lunchbox or taking along on outings. And they are thicker and chewier than most "fruit leather" or similar type snacks, which makes them more satisfying to eat. I find them a pretty good compromise in terms of price, nutrition value, and taste.

review/summary: Yummy not Gritty
review/text: I worried that these would be like some other fruit strips we've tried and hated. Some fruit strips taste like they have a helping of sand added to the mix. But not these! They taste awesome and are not grainy at all. The kids LOVE them. I love them, too. And they are not strips at all but a large twist (think Red Vines only fatter and better). We got the variety pack and haven't had a bad flavor in the entire box. They are super fruity, slightly tart, but still sweet. The texture isn't too soft or gummy. They're just right. These make great snacks for school or anytime. I'll definitely be ordering them again and again.

review/summary: A nice alternative to sugary fruit rolls
review/text: We purchased the variety pack (strawberry, mixed berry, tropical, and sour apple) and overall are quite pleased with these. My daughter really enjoys the strawberry, berry and tropical flavors. However, no one likes the apple. It's not the sour factor (I love sour things), there's a weird bitter aftertaste in this particular flavor that's not appealing. I love how dense and chewy each rope is; they're surprisingly filling and are a very nice healthy alternative to the regular 'fruit' rolls on the market. We'll definitely be buying these again, although next time I'll buy each flavor separately to avoid the apple.

review/summary: Handy, Healthy Snack!
review/text: Our family loves these fruit ropes.  They are very chewy and tasty, and because of the way they are wrapped, you don't get your hands or mouth sticky eating them.  The are a great snack for when you are on-the-go.  The price on Amazon, with the free shipping, by far is the best price for these I have been able to get.  We just buy two boxes at a time to get the free shipping.  Highly recommended!

I requested that they continue stocking them but have not had any luck. So I have to purchase them from Amazon.com. A bit expensive but delicious and healthy!

review/summary: Great fruit snack!
review/text: These are absolutely wonderful.  Well- my son likes them, anyhow... I don't really.<br />But, they are so much healthier than the awful fruit snack you can buy in the grocery store.  There is nothing in these besides fruit.  I am not a 'health nut'- but I do try to avoid high fructose corn syrup, and unnecessary sugar.  Which makes getting things for my son's lunch very difficult.<br /><br />Anyhow, my son has one of these in his lunch almost every day.  His teacher noticed that his fruit snack was actually made of fruit- and so has been recommending them to parents- (his school has a 'no candy' lunch policy, and the fruit snacks that you can buy in the grocery store fall into the candy group).<br /><br />They are expensive.  I don't particulary like them myself (I've never liked fruit snacks of any sort though, so that isn't indicitive of the product's worth at all!).  I find that they leave my son with sticky hands.<br /><br />Even with those negative points- they are still a 5 star snack.  They are healthy, and my son loves them- what more I can ask?

review/text: It's nice to see Clif branching out into a different range of products (like not just energy bars) without sacrificing the quality of ingredients that go into them.  These fruit snacks were great; nice flavor, not too small or too big, and obviously made from real strawberries.  There's not much else to say, other than that I'm not a kid and I'd buy these for myself.  Don't judge me!

review/text: One of our favorite treats especially on the go and it's good for you.  One of these fruit ropes meets the daily requirement for a piece of fruit.  Obviously, it is best to eat fresh fruit.  If you don't have the time or have a little one who is picky, then these are great.  Mixed Berry and Strawberry are my favorites with just the right mix of sweet and tart.  Personally, I can't stand the Sour Apple, but luckily my kid likes it.  Looking forward to trying all of the other flavors!

review/text: What can I say, I got caught up when this was a gold box item and I didn't take the time to research the product.  Essentially these 0.7 ounce about 60 cent each fruit ropes are pulverized apple guts and apple juice with a few other vitamins and flavors.  They may be organic, but they weren't well received in our house.  The line above is from my three year old after she ate one. We'll stick to real fruit (fresh and dried) from now on.

review/summary: our "candy"
review/text: While I was pregnant with my son I constantly carried fruit leather. Not this product, but similar. Remembering and wanting some I went searching for them and found these instead. My children LOVE them. They call them candy. They are even better than the fruit leather since the texture is easier for my children. THey are good for them, taste good, and now I can use them as rewards when my children ask for Candy. Personally, I like all of the flavors I've tried (have not tried pineapple). My children have one or two each that they do not prefer, but this is all a matter of Personal Tastes. I recommend these to everyone I know with children as a candy substitute and to all of my friends as a healthy snack to carry around that will also satisfy their sweet tooth. If you don't like the first flavor you try, try another since they really are a great product. I can not buy this brand locally for less than a $1 each, but they are worth it. Candy costs the same, so why not pay to get something Good for you?

review/summary: Lives up to its name
review/text: My grandpa used to tell stories about eating this stuff in his Army days.  They called it "hardtack" or just simply "tack".  It also seems to be a Swedish staple food.  I grew up in Texas so it is kind of hard to find around here, especially the hearty rye kind.  One time I went to purchase a few packages of it at the local "gourmet food and liquor" store and the cashier warned me someone had returned it because it was "stale".  I told her that they must have been clueless, cause that's how its SUPPOSED to taste.  The stopped carrying it soon after.  I'll just have to start special-ordering it.  It's cheaper here, anyway..<br /><br />I've tried many other Wasa crispbreads and I always come back to this one.  Nothing compares to the hearty rye.  It has a very thick, satisfying crunch and a nice, bland rye flavor.  I eat it with anything and everything, or even by itself.  It's great if you spread butter on it and eat it with soup.  Other examples: tuna fish, cheese, lunchmeat, peanut butter, ice cream, salsa verde, chocolate pudding, Wolf chili, banana slices, SPAM, etc.  Be creative.<br /><br />It NEVER GOES STALE, so don't worry too much about sealing up the package.  I believe that's a design principle in all hardtacks (see wikipedia).  In my opinion, it only gets better with age.  In reality, there is negligible difference between the freshly opened package and the months-old package.  Same crunch, same flavor.  It's like bread, but without the possibility of mold.  Oh, it's also healthy and stuff.  Lots of fiber.<br /><br />I highly recommend the hearty rye.  Buy a few cases now to prepare for Y2012 :)

review/summary: Second to no other cracker that I know of
review/text: Yes, these crackers may look like they would be a great replacement for your old roof shingles or last well into the next millenium in your cabinets safe and sound, so make sure you eat these with some care to avoid accidentally tearing into your gums: they are quite dense and their high fiber and "cracker-ization" process makes them resemble tree bark in more ways than one.  Seriously, these are tasty and go wonderfully with peanut butter, cheese or just by themselves on business trips.  There is no better cracker for keeping your personal plumbing going smoothly and the concurrent benefits of good digestion.  Even my 13 year old eats them as well as many of her friends when they need a small bite of something at our house before mealtime.  I've been a customer of Wasa crisp for over 20 years and I'm convinced there is no better cracker for the nutritional value and fiber content for the money: this one is the Millenium Falcon of their cracker fleet.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Wasa Hearty is the equivalent of "Hearty Rye"?
review/text: I've been eating Wasa Hearty Rye since I first found it in Europe 20 years ago as a teen ("ooh, what's that, it looks yummy") and when I returned to the US in my early 20s I kept buying it.<br /><br />Lately in my area of WA state, the "Hearty Rye" is no longer available, and nor is the "Hearty" crispbread.<br /><br />I found the Hearty Rye here on Amazon with a "Hurry only three boxes left" - I bought two of them, then noticed that everyone was rating THIS Wasa 5 stars and talking about it being Rye.  I've had this kind before and wondered because it tasted like "Hearty Rye" but it only says "Hearty" on it.<br /><br />Now this kind isn't available in this area anymore either :(<br /><br />I love Ak-Mak Sesame Crackers and have been eating those, but now that I can get "Hearty" here on Amazon... and know that it is the old "Hearty Rye" I can have what I've loved for so many years, low carb, high fiber, and if this is indeed the equivalent of the old Hearty Rye - no wheat either.  If anyone knows if this is the exact equivalent, please do leave a comment, they seem to be the same, but then why did they phase out the name "Hearty Rye" and replace it with just "Hearty" (Hearty could be hearty anything... any grain at all or several of them, it's unclear from the name, whereas "Hearty Rye" you knew that it was Hearty Rye ;)<br /><br />I'm not complaining, I love Wasa products, it's just that I've always loved Hearty Rye the best, with a few ounces of tuna salad, some lettuce and tomato, perhaps a slice of avocado and 1 Hearty Wasa, you have a healthy under 300 calorie meal.  No one needs or should eat more than 2-3 ounces of protein at a time, and eating 4-5 "mini-meals" throughout the day is far healthier than sitting down in the evening and eating 8 ounces of beef or chicken or even fish; too much, much too much.<br /><br />Our dinner plates are almost a third larger than dinner plates in Europe and the rest of the world.  Our "salad" plates are what I'd use for a dinner plate (a bit small if you have vegetables, but they can go in a bowl.<br /><br />Ack, tangent; the point is that these are wonderful, low calorie, healthy, low glycemic index, high fiber, relatively low sodium, and as someone else pointed out, they just don't go bad.  I'll spread a low fat Moo-Cow Cheese (I don't know what they're really called, they've always been "Moo-Cow Cheese" - the round box with the red cow's head and eight wedges of cheese inside?  Spreadable, and the calorie version has - I think 30 calories each; whereas an ounce of regular full fat cheese is far more.  Or take fresh lettuce, top with tuna and eat with Wasa, or fresh Haas avocado, a little bit of lemon and a few grains of salt (or not if you prefer) on Wasa is absolutely delicious and super healthy.  We need to eat fat in our diets, but we DON'T need animal fat (except for fish, fish oil) we can get our needs met through, in particular, FLAX seed oil and flax seed in general.  Put a tablespoon or two into your oatmeal and let it cook for a moment or more (add a bit more water it will thicken it) or in soups.  Some eat it in yoghurt but I'm not a fan of "crunchy yoghurt" - I wonder if Wasa has a Flax Seed Crispbread?  Probably not, as the Flax seed has oil in it, and would go bad... and Wasa Flatbreads/Crispbreads are all about not going bad.<br /><br />I've meandered and gone over other things, the main point is this is the one of the healthier things you can eat - and if you really want bread, Dave's Killer Bread (the healthiest variety of all the healthy varieties, all of them are very very healthy -- is Powerseed, the red label)  Unfortunately Amazon doesn't sell it, but Costco does and here's a link to the website: [...] you can select Powerseed from that menu or watch the short video that tells his story (no he wasn't a killer but he was in jail several times and... I won't spoil it for you).<br /><br />For bread, go Dave's, for anything else that accompanies things you would put on bread, for less calories and more fiber, Wasa is it -- and it's so much less expensive to but it here in bulk, and since it doesn't go bad, one 6 or 12 pack can last as long as it needs to.<br /><br />If anyone knows whether "Hearty" really is the equivalent of "Hearty Rye" please do leave a message, I'd love an absolute confirmation. :)

review/text: I have crackers every morning with my coffee. My husband has crackers every morning with his tea. We differ on our taste for crackers as well as on our taste for beverages. We both want a full grain cracker. But, my husband enjoys the Wasa Crispbread, Hearty crackers. Me...not so much. I far prefer the Finn Crisp variety. The four stars above reflect his review. In short, if you prefer a thick cracker, go for Wasa. If you like the crackers to be crispy and not so dry...go for Finn Crisp or something similar.

review/text: I received these free of charge from Wasa in order to do a review & post about it on my blog, read here - http://dailyvitaminf.blogspot.com/2011/12/wasa-review-giveaway.html.<br /><br />When I first tried these, I thought the texture was similar to stale bread. Althought the texture is extremely crunchy, the taste is great. There are so many ways to eat them (if you look at the recipes on their blog) & a lot of them are sooo good. If you are looking for a healthy snack, Wasa breads are the way to go. Even better than the crispbreads are the flatbreads. They are more like crackers, but have the "healthy" appeal.

review/summary: Great for dieting.
review/text: I purchased the product because of the 45 calories a serving. When they arrived I was a little taken back by the thickness of the crisps. They are pretty bland by themselves but I have been topping them as a snack in place of breakfast and lunch and it has been tying me over till dinner. They are proving to be very filling, and again, 45 calories per large cracker. If you're looking for a replacement for lunch in an effort to lose weight then I would suggest giving this a shot, but you will have to experiment with low calorie toppings to go along with it.

review/summary: Great cracker - snack or light meal
review/text: Tasty, crisp, hearty and filling; fiber, no fat and moderately low sodium content make it healthy, too.  I often make a light meal of two of these with a slice of cheese and some fresh fruit and vegetables.  Spread on some peanut butter (or low-fat cream cheese) and jam for a snack with a mug of coffee, tea or milk; tasty and beats cookies or Pop Tarts for nutrition.  Hard to choose between these and the Wasa Multi-Grain crackers, except the Hearty rye crackers have a bit less sodium (70mg vs 80mg).<br /><br />As much as I like them, I'll admit that without a topping or accompanying soup, they're a bit on the dry side.<br /><br />Mine arrived two business days after I ordered them, with no breakage.

review/summary: My Favorite in all of the Wasa line
review/text: This is excellent.  The flavor, the crunch, the thickness - it can't be beat for a delicious crispbread.  I eat low-carb and the crispbreads fit into a healthy plan (if you allow yourself whole-grains, unlike the Paleo diet).  I am limiting my carbs to 50 or less per day so this is an occasional treat crispbread. I rely on the Wasa Fiber for everyday eating although this one is still my favorite, bar-none!<br /><br />Ideas:<br />- Spread cream cheese and top with salmon or tuna and cucumber slices. (I do just cream cheese and cukes also)<br />- Top with tuna, chicken, egg, or salmon salad for an open faced sandwich.<br />- Peanut or any nut butters and jam makes a delicious PBJ open faced sandwich.<br />- Spread brie, goat cheese, or cream cheese and top with lunch meat.<br />- Leftover roasted chicken, beef or lamb and cheese makes a delish open faced sandwich.<br />- Hummus, Tzatziki, Eggplant spread or Ratatouille is tasty on top of your crispbread.

review/text: My cat was diagnosed with struvite stones recently, and the vet told me to buy either this or the another type. (The other type was named D/C, but I can't remember what the brand was.) I was familiar with Royal Canin as a healthy brand, so I went with Royal Canin.<br /><br />It used to be that I'd feed my cat a scoop of Blue Wilderness each morning (the top-rated brand on Amazon), and her bowl would be empty by the evening, at which time I'd give her another scoop. Now, she finishes all her food within 2 hours! This must be because it's low in calories, very delicious, or both.<br /><br />I can't remark on its ability to dilute urine, since I just started using it, and my cat is still on antibiotics from her urinary tract infection.

However, it is not quite as sweet as other stevia products; I find myself using a squirt of it instead of "just a few drops" as it says in the description.  I would still recommend it though because it is a lot less expensive than other stevia flavorings I have found.  I add a little cocoa powder along with it to yogurt to give it more chocolate flavor.

It's a subtle sweetness, but still satisfying.  The chocolate flavor reminds me of chocolate hard candy more than milk chocolate.  The bottles are pretty small, but it only takes a few drops (I used about 6 drops to a full Sigg water bottle) and the price is very reasonable for what you get.<br /><br />I plan on ordering a few more flavors.

review/summary: After taste
review/text: These were a great price that's why I gobbled some up [lemon, toffee, chocolate & strawberry].  I've tried the lemon in some of the WuLong tea [ick..guess I should try a better tasting tea?] noticed the after taste, as usual.  I've also tried the strawberry in some carbonated water [suggestion from the 101 Recipes for the HCG protocol] and that's not too bad.  Definitely something you gotta get use to...because of the after taste. [I know this product and other Stevia products are natural so this taste doesn't mentally affect me as does the Aspartame, Splenda and other man-made sweeteners - those are just plain bad for us but the after taste of these Stevita products remind me of those man-made sweeteners - ICK].  I've actually had a little better luck with the Nu-Stevia powder, as long as I am careful on the amount [for example I use it in my smoothies, i.e. 1 packet for a 16-20oz smoothie].  So the '3' rating is for the taste...and after-taste.  :-(

review/text: Being a Type II Diabetic, I am great fan of liquid Stevia.  I like the flavor ones best, and the chocolate flavored one from Stevita most.  Then, when I saw the price that I got on these, I was absolutely ecstatic!<br /><br />My wife and I use this product as a sweetener in our coffee in the morning and I put a few drops in cold water as refreshing drink throughout the day.  During the winter, putting it in hot water makes a safe and sane hot chocolate.<br /><br />Why safe and sane?  How can a diabetic drink this much sweetener?  Stevita drops have no carbohydrates and no calories.<br /><br />Try it yourself.  It doesn't taste exactly like sugar, but it is well worth the difference.

review/summary: Not worth it
review/text: This has an artificial-sweetener aftertaste.  It also seems to have an alcohol-like flavor, as if I am adding an alcohol based axtract instead of something made with water.  I have yet to try my strawberry and orange of the same brand, but the chocolate is definitely not worth trying to save money by purchasing this brand (go for sweetleaf, it doesn't taste like a 'diet' sweetener).

review/summary: It's okay
review/text: I've tried the Chocolate, Cognac and Vanilla.  All leave a bitter taste in coffee.  I mix it 50/50 with liquid Splenda and it isn't bad at all though and the flavor still comes through without being overpowering.

review/summary: Chemical aftertaste
review/text: I'm a regular stevia user, but this is the first, last, and only time I'll use this product -- or any stevia product that is artificially flavored or extracted with alcohol.  The chemical aftertaste from this product was overpowering and distasteful.  For a better stevia product, try SteviaClear by SweetLeaf -- the only stevia product I use.
