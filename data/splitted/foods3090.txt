review/summary: Remembrances of Germany
review/text: When I was stationed in Germany many years ago we discovered these brandy filled cherries; and even though I am not a fan of chocolate covered cherries, these were wonderful. It was mainly because they were not the cloying sweet cheery candy that one finds most of the time - the brandy took care of that.<br /><br />Our paycheck was not very big then, but we usually got one box a payday and ate them for a treat - holding them upside down , biting off the bottom to form a cup, savoring the chocolate and then eating the rest... what memories these bring back and still worth every penny or Pfennig as the case may be.

review/summary: Nice little treat
review/text: I bought these cherries because I have heard how excellent they are.  The Asbach cherries more than lived up to their reputation.  The cherries are flavorful and the chocolate is a good quality.  For those of you who might be concerned about the alcohol content, while the brandy is  undeniably there, it does not overpower the taste of either the cherries or the chocolate, and if you limit yourself to one or two at a time, you should be fine.

review/summary: Great Coffee Gift From a Non-Coffee Drinker
review/text: I have now bought Tully's coffee twice as a gift. I am not a coffee drinker whatsoever; however, I have lived in two places known for coffee: Seattle and Italy (espresso, anyone?). My relatives exclaim that Arabica coffee from Cafe Mexico in Naples, Italy, is the world's best, but if you want a high-quality coffee from an American brand, I haven't gone wrong with Tully's yet.<br /><br />My coffee-drinking friends and co-workers in Seattle said that Tully's is by far the best Seattle coffee chain (better than Peete's, Seattle's Best, and for certain, Starbucks). The only better American coffee comes from the little drive-up shack.

review/summary: What a mess
review/text: The popocorn itself was exceptional, among the best caramel corn I've ever eaten.  Unfortunately, the shipping is another matter entirely.  The contents of my box were a sticky tangle of torn bags and melted caramel.  This happened not once but twice.  Out of a total of 12 bags there was one that was salvagable.  Amazon's return policy is terrific, but if something can't be delivered then it shouldn't be sold.

review/text: The popcorn arrived quickly via Fedex, but it was clear the rush shipping was a waste of time.  From the minute I opened the box, I could smell a strange stale odor.  I opened one bag and sampled it, hoping against hope that I didn't just waste my money.  The popcorn was stuck together, chewy and had a funny after taste.  I didn't bother to open the other packets. Just touching each one told me the other bags were in the same condition.  I would have been better off going to a department store and buying last years tin can of caramel corn.  I threw the rest away, fearful if I returned it, it would only get sold to some other unsuspecting soul.  Steer clear of this vendor.

I only went with this company because it came sliced and with the rind.  But when I received it it was warm as if it just came out of a oven (the back of a delivery truck).  With this being pork I could not serve this to my family or friends because the area where the bone was had blood seeping out of it.

review/summary: Smooth, a bit inconsistent
review/text: We have purchased several bags of Davidson's tea - love that they are certified organic and are reasonably-priced. The Ceylon has become a favorite for my daughter and me. It it smooth and is delicious black or holds up well to milk. It does need to be steeped carefully as it can become bitter if left too long. The only drawback here is that the last bag we purchased was rather bland Perhaps it was because the leaves were especially large or maybe it was the time of the year, but it seemed to need a lot more tea to make a tasty cup. Overall I highly recommend the Davidson's. I also like the English Breakfast and Irish Breakfast.

review/summary: After noon tea anybody?
review/text: Davidson Ceylon OP black 16oz. This black tea has a good large leaf size as the grade is Orange Pekoe (which refer to black tea leaf size not the flavor). Produces a good color after 4 to 5 minutes of brewing (mashing) in a pot. if you have a cool room or having tea on the deck, get a cover on the pot to keep it hot(a ski hat is fine, mines red). This tea is hard to over brew so a few extra minutes will not ruin it, usually after first cups are poured a 2nd addition of freshly boiled water will give a satisfactory refill. Best served with milk but can take lemon instead or milk & sugar. however less sugar required than for smaller leaf grades as this is less bitter. For my early morning tea the Davidsons english breakfast is also a good choice.<br /><br />If you have not brewed an OP before & your experience is with loose leaf english breakfast an extra spoonful is required (as the is leaf larger same size spoonful is a smaller weight of tea) or tea bags the brew time is 1 to 2 minutes longer for the first cups to be ready to poured. But will not produce as much tannin which causes dry or bitter after taste, often associated with over brewed tea of the smaller leaf sizes. Additionally benefit our dental hygienist has less stain removing to do on our 6 monthly check up! we drink a lot of tea!!<br /><br />It may take you a few trial brews to get used to this milder, more subtle style of black tea but worth it. Best for when you have time to relax & enjoy the view from the deck as you sip this. excellent with home baked goods too! more cake anyone?<br /><br />Disclosure: I am an expat Englishman living in the states so I have a preference for black teas with milk added. However i do drink chinese style tea without milk this, of course.<br /><br />Other tea I subscribe to from Davidson.<br />English breakfast (prefer to irish breakfast blend as the Irish has a more "malty overtone").<br />Formosa style oolong tea-this is extremely good too

review/summary: Raspberry Apple Vitamin Water
review/text: I think this is one of my favorite flavors from the Vitamin Water line.  There area  few others I like just as well, but this one ranks right up there.<br /><br />Raspberry apple tastes exactly how it sounds.  It has a nice berry flavor, over-layed with the taste of apple juice, and at times I detect a hint of pomegranate in the taste as well, although its not a listed ingredient.  But maybe that's just from the deep red color of the drink working on my brain.  Its sweet, but not syrupy sweet, and it really is just like drinking juice to me, even though its water.  I'd like to to have a little stronger of a taste, but overall, its not bad.<br /><br />The ingredients are good.  Real sugar and water, and vitamins.  And the flavoring is natural.  It seems pretty healthy to me, and as such I don't feel guilty when I drink it.  And considering plain water has unfortunately never been a favorite of mine, I get my water intake from this drink.  They also pump it full of vitamins, which helps when I forget to take my daily vitamin.  At least I'm getting some vitamin C, and a few others including zinc from this book.<br /><br />A good drink from Vitamin water.  I really like their products and will continue to buy them.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Medium "so so" grade white tea - good for iced tea preparation
review/text: I bought this tea because I love white tea.  Normally I buy loose tea, and of the highest grade.<br /><br />I knew this tea would likely lose some character if it was sold in tea bags.  Also, the tea contained in these bags is not the highest grade, but of the second grade.  This is NOT a knock against the tea as clearly indicates the tea is Bai Mu Dan or Pai Mu Dan which is one level below Silver Needle.<br /><br />I noticed this tea is quite a bit below the grade of Silver Needle.  No taste of freshly mown hay here.  However, the tea does smell a little smoky (probably cured over a wood fire).  The taste is slightly woody or darker, but somewhat undefined.<br /><br />This tea is okay though, better than some cheaper green teas I've gotten from discount stores.<br /><br />I think the best purpose for this tea is iced tea.  Fill a small jug full of water, hang a few bags of white tea in it, then put it in the fridge.  After a few hours you can take out the bags and you'll have a nice base of white iced tea.  Then just add a few cubes, or any other flavouring, and you've got a nice white iced tea that is better than the stuff you can buy already made up in the bottle.<br /><br />For the price, however, it's a lot of medium "so so" grade white tea conveniently put into bags which you can drink at work or in the morning.  However, as I have previously said, I think this tea is destined towards ice tea preparation.  If you want a really good cup of white tea, your probably going to have to buy loose tea and pay a lot more $$$'s.<br /><br />So I gave this tea four stars.

Silver Needle may be the best of the best, but it's also very expensive.<br /><br />  Black and green tea can have a bite to it,  White tea is smooth and, from what I read, VERY high in antioxidants and low in caffine.  It's good both hot and iced.

review/summary: Good white tea at a superb price
review/text: The Amazon description, saying this is Bai Mu Dan, is incorrect.  It is actually fannings. Fannings is the second to the smallest leaf size. Fannings are used in tea bags because of their small size and economic price.  On the Uncle Lee's tea website, this tea is shown just as white camellia sinensis.  The Uncle Lee's Organic White tea that is described as Bai Mu Dan on the Uncle Lee website is $5 for 18 bags.<br /><br />The only other pure white tea I've had is Republic of Tea's Emperor's white tea, which I find superior to this tea, having a milder and sweeter flavor that is even more pleasant to drink without sweetener than this one.  The Uncle Lee's white tea is closer to an oolong in both color and flavor than the Emperor's, with just a hint of bitterness and none of the herbal tones of a green tea.<br /><br />That said, the RoT Emperor's White is almost 6 times more expensive than this tea, and Uncle Lee's is still easy to drink without sweetener, so I'll save the Emperor's for special moments and use the Uncle Lee's as my "daily drinker."<br /><br />Having more flavor, I find that this makes an excellent iced tea.

review/summary: Smooth and Mellow
review/text: The organic label and price make this tea appealing.  White tea became a good compromise because black and green teas were unpredictable and too strong in flavor and tannins.  Some green teas were too smoky, and some black teas tasted like tar.  Other black and green teas tasted like wood chips.  White tea is smooth and mellow, so there are less chances of things going wrong with white tea.  We tried different organic and non-organic brands of green tea, and they were expensive and sometimes unpalatable.  You could get a headache from trying to sort through the myriad of tea choices.  If you don't like strong tea, and you don't want to gamble with different brands; then you should try the organic white tea.

review/summary: A great tea for the money.
review/text: This tea is very mild and really does taste great and I could definitely see myself drinking this everyday. I mainly use loose leaf teas, but find tea bags useful for the office or if I'm in need of a quick fix. This tea is a great value, the bags are individually wrapped, they smell great and I've tried two and three steeping with one bag and while you loose the caffeine after the first steep, the taste was really good.<br />Just a quick note, do not add boiling water to this tea, the water should be under 200 degrees (not sure on the exact temps). What I do is get the water just to boil, let the water sit 3 minutes and then pour. I will steep the tea for about two to three minutes. For a second infusion I only let the water sit for about 30 seconds to a minute. Works for me.<br />I can recommend this tea highly, I think you will like it.

review/text: Uncle Lee filled the bill for me (or perhaps I should say filled the tea bag?). I use white tea as the base for an iced beverage that I make. My supermarket stopped selling the brand I was buying. I was very pleased to search Amazon and find quality organic white tea bags, in large quantities, at the best price I've seen anywhere! The tea has a good flavor; it's not so bitter as some white teas I've tried. I've been totally happy with my purchase.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.

review/text: I had a hard time giving up drinking soda, I had decided that I didn't need all that carbonation,<br />sugar (or artificial sweetener), and all the other things that are put into soda.<br /><br />I brewed 8 bags of the Uncle Lee's White Tea and use enough water to make 3 quarts. I then add<br />1 quart of Orange Juice to it to total 1 gallon. It tastes like weak Orange Juice; but still tastes<br />good to me. I recently tried something different by adding one of those "green tea, orange-mango"<br />flavored tubes made by Crystal Light, it is intended for only one glass, but I added it to the<br />gallon container and it gave it a nice perk to the flavor.<br /><br />It tastes great, is cheap, and is supposed to be good for me with all the antioxidants and all that<br />the White Tea has.

review/text: My mom is an avid green tea drinker. I have bought her just about every brand of green tea available including Lipton, Twinings, Celestial Seasonings, Bigelow and probably a dozen others, including some of the fanciest and most expensive. Her favorite of all green teas is Uncle Lee's Organic Green Tea. She will drink others if she has to, but she doesn't enjoy any other tea half as much as this one. I have made it a habit to buy the 4-pack of 100s from Amazon to keep her in stock as she drinks 4-6 cups of this stuff every day. For taste, nothing compares to Uncle Lee's Organic Green Tea. And the price here at Amazon is really good too! Give it a try. I think you will be glad you did.

review/summary: A Bit Bitter
review/text: Well, I am going to be a bit contrary to the higher ratings given this tea. By no means am I a tea expert, but I drink more cups of green tea in a day than the law allows.  I have tried a large variety of teas: green, black, oolong, white..... the list goes on. The vast majority of my tea consumption is  green tea, definitely my preference over black teas, though I do like oolong. I tried my first cup of Mr. Lee's Organic Green Tea today, it sits to the left of my keyboard at the moment as I type this review. When I removed the teabags from the box to put in my air tight canister, out of habit I sniffed the collection of tea bags, curious of the aroma. It was a familiar smell, basically the same "fragrance" as I have noticed in many previous boxes of green tea brands such as Lipton, Salada, Carrington, Prince of Peace, etc. I popped my cup of tap water into the microwave and while waiting for the water to heat up, I admired the tidy plastic wrapper which had enveloped the tea bag. I dropped the tea bag into the hot water, allowed the tea to brew, a familiar aroma arose from the cup of tea, again the same aroma as the previous mentioned teas. The first sip, BITTER, what a disappointment. And the bitterness lingers, objectionable bitterness. I found the tea to be quite bland, void of any nice flavors that would elevate this tea to nice aromatic status.  But, hey, the price was right and I liked the individually wrapped teabags, that's why I gave it three stars. But price and clever wrappings do not a good cup of green tea make. To date, my favorite affordable everyday tea is Sencha, Japanese green tea packaged and marketed by Yamamotoyama Tea. Give it a try, you might like it too! I prefer the loose tea style as opposed to individual tea bags, loose tea is a bit "greener", more earth friendly, omitting the tea bags and wrappers.

review/text: Due to the rave reviews here, I ordered this tea.  Now I wonder what quality of teas these reviewers have been drinking.  Many of the opinions seem inflated.<br /><br />My report is that for the super reasonable price of this four-box package, you get a bland, undistinguished, OK green tea.  Because I drink a lot of green tea, I'll be periodically opting for Uncle Lee's Organic Green Tea, so I can make my other tastier (more expensive) organic selections last longer.  For those purposes, the tea is fine.<br /><br />There's nothing abjectly wrong with this tea, but there's nothing special about it, either. Its biggest asset is that it's organic and very low-priced.  If that's what you're looking for, you'll be satisfied.

review/text: Edit to original review:<br /><br />I just noticed the warning not to use while pregnant or breast feeding. I have no idea if this applies to all the teas or only one of them, but you will want to take note of that. I'm not in that group, but don't want anyone buying this if they are and use my recommendation as the basis for buying it.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />I originally purchased this because they were out of the plain 'throat coat' and I couldn't find it locally.I was suprised to find that the sampler is actually quite good.<br /><br />Now, keep in mind that this is MEDICINAL herbal tea, it's not made for taste, but it works amazingly well.<br /><br />I bought it in a rush when my husband had a miserable cold and was out driving every day in 40-degree weather. He was really suffering.<br /><br />I made him the throat coat and the cold remedy versions, heavily laced with honey so it was palatable and put them in his Oxo Travel Mugs.<br /><br />They really reduced his suffering and made his long days a little less tedious.<br /><br />Throat Coat is by far the best product. Be sure to steep it quite a while as recommended. The name says it all. You'll feel as if your throat is lined with velvet.<br /><br />And there are no chemicals or drugs to interfere with the ability to drive or even think (antihistamines make me a whirling dervish & make the hubby pass out cold).<br /><br />I sent a box of this over to my sister in law when she came down with a bug and she raved about it for weeks.<br /><br />6 of them is a lot, but if you have a lot of family and especially kids who tend to get colds a lot, you'll use them.

The "Throat Coat" tea is good to use when you first start feeling pain in your throat. The "Gypsy Cold Care" has hyssop in it which is antibacterial and antiviral. The "Echinacea Plus" tea also has echinacea which helps with sinus infections. When you are congested you can drink the "Breathe Easy" tea which has peppermint and eucalyptus in it. Some of the other ingredients in the teas include: licorice root, calendula flowers, ginger root, slippery elm, marshmallow root, wild cherry bark, fennel fruit, cinnamon bark, sweet orange peel, lemongrass leaf, elder flower, yarrow flower, rose hips, safflower petal and cloves.

review/summary: Can't Live With Out This Stuff.
review/text: So I know there is a warning that you should not drink these teas if you are pregnant or breastfeeding but I want to remind you that just about every product out there has that warning on it for legal reasons. Even their Mother's Milk tea has that warning and it is made specifically to help women increase their breast milk supply while breastfeeding. With that said...I am breastfeeding and have been for a long time. Before I found these teas I would suffer through a sore throat, stuffy nose, cold, etc with out taking medication because I didn't want my baby/toddler to get any through my breast milk. Herbal remedies are much gentler on your body so I feel very comfortable knowing that these herbs will be passed to my child instead of a strong chemical remedy like DayQuil. I make my teas very strong and add some local raw honey for even more health benefits, and it makes the teas taste even better. I do enjoy the taste of the teas much more than I thought I would since they are after all medical remedies. The teas are not miracle cures but they really do help and you don't get a doped up feeling like you do from a lot of the OTC meds out there. I'm not sure I have a favorite, I find they are all really nice to have on hand when you need them. I also enjoy just drinking them, mainly the Cold Care and Echinacea, as a nice cup of tea on a cold day.<br /><br />Buy one box and see what you think, I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />***EDIT***<br /><br />I just wanted to add that while in general herbs are pretty safe when breastfeeding you do not want to take them as supplements or eat/drink extremely large amounts of them with out first making sure they are safe. You would probably have to drink an entire box of this stuff in one day for it to really cause any problems with breastfeeding so if you drink the typical 1-6 cups (using 1 tea bag per cup, 6 cups steeped with 2 tea bags each might be a little much) you should be fine.

review/text: I've been sick with God-knows-what for a few weeks now and I've had a terrible cough and congestion.....this has helped me sooo much.  This stuff will definitely relieve your symptoms.  One note of caution....if you have high blood pressure it tells you on the package not to use the "throat coat" and the "breathe easy".  I have borderline high blood pressure but I still went ahead and used it anyway.  I think it's the fennel that raises the blood pressure but that's just my guess.  Anyways I still highly suggest buying this stuff, its awesome and it even has a pleasant taste.

review/summary: Best Dog Bone!
review/text: When Petsmart quit carrying this product I was very disappointed. This was my favorite product they had on their shelves. The N-Bone is the only edible dog bone my havanese boy does not finish in 3 minutes or less. If I get him the Jumbo he chews and chews and chews. Keeps him busy for awhile. Then I take it away from him and put it aside for another time. One giant N-Bone gives him a lot of enjoyment for several chewing sessions before he finishes it. I get him the jumbo size because it looks cute when he carries it. He's so tiny and the bone is so big! But more than that because it seems harder for him to finish than the smaller sizes for some reason. My girl havanese gets a smaller N-Bone since she is intimidated by the larger sizes. Even though I get my little dog a giant bone I don't recommend everyone do so. You must supervise them and see what is best for your little one. Please excuse any typos in this review.

review/summary: Nice ingredients, but doesn't last long if your dog is a chewer
review/text: Based on my experience, this is a 3 star item for me, but I know my dog is a chewing/pooping exception, so this could be a good item for a lot of other dogs.<br /><br /> My dog, a greyhound, loves to chew bones, antlers, rawhides, stuff like that.  I don't like to give a lot of rawhide, and the antlers are good, but I thought I would try this one out for something different.  I gave it to her and in 15 minutes she was halfway finished with it.  I really did not expect that at all.  It feels hard like it would take her awhile to grind it down, but she was able to bite off small chunks of it at a time.  Being that she has a delicate constitution, I took it away from her after she ate half of it.  Needless to say her nighttime deposit was pretty loose, but hey, I can't be sure it was from the bone.  And to be honest, my other dog (who doesn't like to chew) can eat stuff she can't and have no troubles.  Still, I won't get her these again, I have yet to find anything that beats the chewing power of an antler!

I have no clue how many calores one of  wafers will "provide" and I don't care. I love it, I treat myself to it  from time to time without guilt. Life is to short to bother with calories. Wafers are packed with flavor, crispy and tasty. Rum is fake, just for flavor, no alcohol in it. Enjoy it and then work out next day a bit harder. I do!

review/summary: One of my three favorite brands of couscous
review/text: Couscous is a staple to me and the size of this package - about enough to serve five - is perfect since I live alone and fend for myself.<br /><br />This, and most other brands without flavorings (which contain too much sodium in my opinion) are heart- and lifestyle-healthy. Not only is the plain couscous itself fat free, but at 190 calories per serving it provides 7 grams of protein (pretty impressive for a gain-based dish.) But that does not distinguish this specific brand from the others. What I most like about Vigo's couscous is that consistent in preparation. What I mean by that is if you follow the instructions to the letter each serving of couscous is going to be identical to past ones. I have used brands that I will not name that are not as consistent or as repeatable when preparing it.<br /><br />Plus the size is perfect for families that don't often eat couscous, meaning no waste and for most families the 10 ounce package can be used in its entirety in a single meal without having to worry about storing it and keeping it fresh.<br /><br />For the record, the other two brands I consume are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011T2ZJS">Marakesh Express Couscous Plain Can, 25.2-Ounce Can(Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HQPNZY">Sadaf Couscous, Original Flavor, 13-Ounce Boxes, (Pack of 12)</a>. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but each is of the highest quality and are the ones I recommend to friends.

review/summary: Good dark, rich coffee for breakfast time
review/text: After trying lots of different blends in K-Cups over the past couple of years, I've settled on a mix of Tully's French Roast and Newman's Extra Bold as my go-to choices for morning wake up coffees.  Both have a strong, deep flavor that pairs well with weekend waffles and other "sweet" goodies.  It's a shame that the price has gone up so much, but it's not the fault of the coffee.  I'll keep drinking this one -- it's one of my simple pleasures and still much more affordable than picking up a cup at the local espresso stand.

review/text: Addicted to this brand and found this coffee fresh, bold and unbitter.<br />The delivery was super fast and my only complaint is it came in an unmarked box meaning I felt I had to count. But the count was right on & for the savings I'm not complaining so will order again. This coffee being bold but with no aftertaste is one I never tire of it. Everyone who tries this loves it. I find if I brew a small cup makes excellent iced coffee or warm latte. My coffee maker does have size options so considering cost of lattes my homemade version using liquid stevia/almond milk is money saving plus healthy. I have used both plain/flavored stevia and my coffee flavor stays true. All in all addicted and loving every cup.<br /><br />I am adding to review ordered a few days ago and a super charged delivery this was in original package this time and I am a very satisfied customer. Fresh cup in hand while I write this!
