Poptarts are fairly sweet, but a nice guilty pleasure. Frosting them makes them so unhealthy that even a hedonist eater like me has to say no.

review/summary: worth it
review/text: I've been buying ribeye steaks at a nation-wide store which will remain nameless.  A steak is a steak, right?<br /><br />Hubby was dying to try Omaha steaks, so I bought him a box as a present.<br /><br />I cooked up two steaks - both ribeyes, one Omaha and the other from the store.  I cooked them both with steak dust, for the same time and the same temperature.<br /><br />The Omaha steak was like butter.  The difference was so obvious.  I can't believe that both steaks came from the same species.<br /><br />This is now a once-a-week dinner in our house.  It's not cheap, but it's still less than going out.  Add to the steak the Omaha stuffed potatoes and a nice salad and you've got a dinner that's every bit as nice as the average restaurant.<br /><br />Yeah.  They're worth it.

review/summary: Destruction for Your Mouth
review/text: My first run-in with this product was nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />I had finished up my Blair's Death Sauce, which I found to be very pleasant on eggs, so I decided to crack open this bottle.  Usually I do a small taste test first before using the product, but I figured it would be fairly similar to Death Sauce in taste and intensity.  So, like I did with Death Sauce, I put it on my eggs as if it were ketchup.<br /><br />Big mistake.<br /><br />With that first bite, I knew I was doomed.  My lips swelled up (I used a lot of it), my glasses fogged over, and I had trouble breathing.  I actually almost called 911 because I feared my throat was going to swell shut.<br /><br />Yes, it's that good.<br /><br />I don't use nearly as much now.  I learned my lesson.  My tongue was destroyed for weeks after that, and I'm amazed I actually didn't have to go to the hospital.  It is as hot as it is delicious, and I couldn't recommend this more ... unless, of course, the hottest thing you can handle is Tabasco.  In that case, steer clear.

review/summary: great balance of heat and flavor
review/text: I'm somewhat of a pepper head, but not 'hard core'.  I've tried quite a few 'ultra' hot sauces like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DID5R">Dave's Insanity</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007MW2NY">Mad Dog 357</a>, etc., but find that they are generally too hot to use except for cooking or to put just a couple of drops on a sandwich or burrito.  A couple of drops of sauces like that adds plenty of heat but not much flavor.<br /><br />This sauce is very hot but not as extreme.  To make a dish respectably hot, I can add enough of this sauce to also add flavor.  This sauce has a wonderful flavor, so it has become one of my favorites for sandwiches, wraps, burritos, tacos, etc.<br /><br />If you think grocery store hot sauces are hot (or perceptibly spicy at all), you may want to look for something milder or use this only for cooking, ... if you are a hard-core pepper head then this may be too mild, ... but if you can handle a fair amount of heat and want something potent but flavorful, this is a great general-purpose sauce.<br /><br />My favorite hotter sauce is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002B9HC6I">Mad Dog 357 Ghost</a>, but it has a different flavor and adds less flavor for a given amount of heat.  My favorite milder sauce is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030J4YTG">Mad Dog 357 Pure Ghost</a>, but it has a much different flavor and adds a lot more of it for the same amount of heat.  Blairs After Death has a great flavor that goes well with a lot of dishes, and it has a respectable but not insanely ridiculous amount of heat.

review/summary: Perhaps my favorite hot sauce ever?
review/text: Let's start off by saying I love hot foods. I cook rice, chicken, burgers etc just so I can have something with my hot sauce.  That said, Blair's After Death is arguably my favorite hot sauce; my other favorite is Blair's Pure Death.  Pure Death is straight tomatoes, peppers and vinegar, but After Death contains no ghost peppers, but contains Chipotle peppers so it has a very distinct Chipotle flavor (much like the original Death sauce, only hotter).  On some items, I prefer the chipotle flavor and on others I don't, which is why I put this as a tie for my favorite hot sauce.<br /><br />After Death is not so hot where I can't really use it, but it is hot enough where it can provide more than adequate burn, and a bottle lasts me quite a while (unlike Pure Death which I go through very fast).<br /><br />I highly recommend Blair's After Death on a burger.  It is hot enough where if you use enough it can make your eyes water, but not so hot where you can't taste the burger and the Chipotle flavoring goes very well with a good burger.

review/summary: Savory, Flavorful, and EASY!
review/text: If you like Thai food or peanuts and slight-to-medium spicy food.....this is a product I highly recommend.  This product is a dry coating that sticks to moist meat.<br /><br />I use it with skinless/boneless chicken breasts....and let it cook for 40 minutes or so covered at 350degF, and the last ten minutes take the cover off, lower the heat to 325degF and let the juices condense to a syrupy consistency that your guests/family can spoon over potatoes (mashed or baked or sweet).  Careful, it burns easily past a certain point.  I was so glad when I saw this product available on Amazon as not many markets carry this product and while you must buy 12 packs, it is about 30% less than buying the individual packs at the market.  The packets are foil, so the product will have a long shelf life. I have been using it for five years and my family and friends always compliment me on the meal.  This product is the REAL DEAL...trust me.

review/text: I like spice, so it's great for me, but if you are using it for meat and are in the habit of marinading and seasoning the meat before preparing it, tone down your own spices, this spicy peanut bake is spicy enough on its own and tangy and doesn't require additional seasonings. So be careful.

review/summary: Wonderful for singles/couples ...
review/text: This comes packaged in a packet that contains two envelopes of the peanut-spice coating mix, each one covering 2 large chicken breast halves.  You can use one, and save the other for a later meal.  This is a VERY nice touch for those of us who cook for only one or two people.<br /><br />The mix itself is very good -- mildly spicy with finely chopped peanuts.  It bakes into a yummy "sweet"-spicy sauce, a little like barbecue sauce.  It's much better than the usual "shake and bake" coating mixes.  I've had it on chicken breast halves, chicken tenders, and pork chops so far, and really like the flavor.  It isn't too salty, either.<br /><br />I'll definitely be purchasing more of this in the future.

If you do not overcook them, they come out perfectly juicy and delicious every time.

I cover a cookie sheet with foil, spray with EVOO or Pam. Lay fish or chicken on sprayed foil, sprinkle peanut bake on protein of choice to coat well, pat seasoning on, if needed. I usually bake extra coated boneless chicken breasts to slice on salads the next day. (Awesome with a thai peanut or sesame ginger dressing.) Not spicy, very peanutty. Use foil to save yourself sticky, baked on clean up.

We put down some rooster (srirachi) sauce in a casserole dish, the coated chicken breasts and top it off with a little more sauce. That makes it fairly spicy (the peanut bake itself is not very spicy at all - unless you're super sensitive). Also you can throw brown rice in the oven and everything's ready at the same time (cheat with a little microwaved-steamed broccoli and your well rounded meal is ready with no real effort on your part!).

review/summary: I Like Betty Lou's Peanut Butter Balls Better
review/text: So far I have tried Betty Lou's Coconut Macadamia Nut Balls, the Spirulina Ginsing and the Peanut Butter.<br /><br />I found the Spirulina Ginsing a litte too sweet (although drinking it with bitter tea helped to cut the cloying sweetness) and the taste a bit odd.<br /><br />So far, the Peanut Butter are my definite favorite of the Betty Lou's nut ball products.  I ordered the Spirulina Ginsing because they have less calories than the Peanut Butter (170 calories versus 190 calories), but I think I will stick with the Peanut Butter, which I found more palatable.<br /><br />I do find that the Betty Lou's balls make a great afternoon snack -- they are very filling and can stop a junk food craving in its tracks.

But if you had asked me, how much does each item cost separately if a 4-pack costs $8.50, I don't think I'd come up with $0.57 / Item as the answer.<br /><br />Maybe it's British math, I don't know.

review/summary: Large?
review/text: Compared to a couple other brands of dental chews that I purchase for my dog, (a favorite-Dancing Paws Breath-A-Licious, at Swanson Health Products online, also less $), I wasn't much impressed with the Twistix brand. My dog is a 45lb. Border Collie that is considered medium and these are labeled "large"...they are small for her. To me, the "Twistix" are also quite a bit thinner than they appear on the ad page, and they were quickly devoured by her. I would compare it to eating a "Twizzler" in our human world. I'm happy that she liked them, though I wouldn't purchase the Twistix to help improve her oral hygiene. Looking back, I should have reviewed and recognized that the ad describes the package at 5.5oz. which is light for 7 chews. Also, I've noticed in the 2 weeks since I purchased them, the price is up over 70 cents. I don't feel they are worth it.

review/summary: My two toy poodles love these!
review/text: I just purchased a container of 25 for $9.99 at TJ Maxx.  Poodles build a lot of tartar on their teeth so I thought this would be a great way to help their hygiene.  Seeing the cost online for just a few "stix"... I'm happy to see that I got a great deal.  Possibly I'll go back today to purchase a few more containers of them.  My two dogs<br />absolutely go nuts over these.  For a toy poodle, one "stix" seems large... so I break them in half.  However, they would devour a whole one in no time if I let them have it.  The ingredients look healthy.... starting with Rice flour, protein concentrate, vegetable glycerin, water, etc....

review/summary: Best and Worst Purchase I could have ever made.
review/text: A lady at small pet store who is always trying to push me onto all the extremely expensive cat anything with the lectures about their health and so forth (youve prob all had one of those sales people before) keep putting these on the counter trying to convince me to purchase. I nicely said no, they are fine with their own treats and as she continued to ring up my order, she threw a few of them in the bag to try.<br />I got home, unpacked my items and almost forgot they were in there, so I pulled them out, called the cats over and tossed them on the ground. I have three cats. One, who will eat anything and push the others out of the way to get it, one that likes almost everything but is a slow eater, and the third who never eats treats, he walks away, not wanting a thing to do with them.<br />Never in the years Ive owned these boys have I seen such a reaction. All of them, grubbing them down, searching for more and then started to whine. I knew I was doomed. They followed me around for awhile harrassing me for more.<br />I broke down, ordered them (shipping was alot faster than I expected) and now those are the only treats they will eat. They sit and stair at the shelf of my bakers rack making sure I notice them everything I walk into the room. They are so obsessed with them, the youngest(the pushy one) has learned to take his turn and they are thrilled everytime I grab the jar.<br />Positive Points for their love of the treat.<br />Negative Points for the price, quantity given and the whining and begging

The packaging was in a corn-nuts box with a cutout for easy access. Plus you can use the subscribe and save feature of amazon.com and save even more money.  Great product great service.

review/text: As the title states, I have no issue with the product itself. Unfortunately, there is only a feedback area for Amazon packaging which was fine...but I had issues with the product packaging and wanted to leave that feedback somewhere in the event that it happens to someone else.<br /><br />Although the shipping box was fine, the box that held the packs was partially open. Also, there were only 11 packs of what should have been 12 packs. Even worse is that the equivalent of one pack's content was loose in the box. However, the wrapper itself was not in the box. It was as if someone had opened the product box, opened a pack, dumped the contents into the  product box, and threw out the wrapper.<br /><br />I am disappointed because I was shorted one pack in this delivery and had to clean up the mess from the missing pack. Also, even if I want to re-order I don't feel comfortable doing so given this experience.

review/summary: I love it.  I love it dearly.  But I will NOT pay the mafia price.
review/text: As the title says, I love Corn-nuts dearly.  They are probably my favorite snack, right next to beef jerky.  I don't know how many bags I have bought over the decades (yes, DECADES!), but the Corn-nuts corporation (and now their new owner) have collected a lot of wallet change from me over those years.<br /><br />Having said that, I have been more observant over the last few years and I have noticed that the price of this treat has been quite expensive.  At this very moment, the price is almost five bucks a pound for a snack made out of corn.  That is almost double what I pay for the beef shoulder steaks I marinade and grill for my family.  That price is about three times what I pay for the various pretzels, corn chips, tortilla chips, and potato chips that I buy for my family.  That price is almost double the cost of the fancy candies I buy my family, from Snickers bars to Reeses  peanut butter cups.  In short, most fancy candies cost around (or less than) three bucks a pound.  And the Corn-nutz cost almost double?!  Give me a break!<br /><br />I really do love the product.  But the person in charge of pricing is a worthless, useless, and despicable POS that deserves to have his (or hers) reset butttom pushed as soon as possible.<br /><br />I love the product.  But I will NOT buy it until you overcome your egotistical delusions.  Your product is NOT worth four bucks a pound. IT NEVER WILL.  Get rid of that delusion.  Sell your corn snacks for two bucks a pound and be happy to make the profit.  And I will be happy to buy your snack.

review/summary: Best Goat Cheese!
review/text: There's a reason this cheese is so expensive - it is considered one of the best blue cheeses in the world.  I work in the restaurant industry, and it is widely known that Humboldt blue cheese is a delicacy.  It is very smooth, very creamy, doesn't have the tanginess that goat cheeses often have - I could eat this all day every day and be the happiest person in the world - and weigh about 800 pounds.  Buy some, you won't regret it!

review/summary: Was Not Impressed
review/text: This cheese is best described as solidified sour cream with a faint hint of blu.<br /><br />I tried to like it and feel around for the flavor, but the sour cream taste overpowers whatever the unique flavor of the mold might have.  After separating the vein alone and trying that it tastes musty but not in a good way to me.  Those that say this is the best cheese they tried should give gorgonzola a shot for the title.

review/summary: Longest lasting chew toy I've seen
review/text: My dog loved these, and I loved how long they lasted.  My dog started by chewing off all the flesh, and then spent literally months gradually working away at the small bone parts until he could get to the marrow inside.  He continued to be interested in gnawing them even after the marrow was gone, which is perhaps not the best testament to my dog's intelligence, but is still endearing to me.<br /><br />My only quibble is with the price being offered on Amazon at the moment (8.87 + 6.11 shipping).  Given that I can get these for 10 bucks plus tax in a pet store, I don't understand the pricing here.  They're not that heavy to ship, they must be at most 2 pounds!

review/text: Wild Planet's Sardines in spring water is an excellent product  and I highly recommend it as an alternative  to Tuna. The filets are large and meaty and they mix well in various recipes. These sardines are delicious:  when added to salads, mixed with mayo/or olive oil, capers and and a bit of lemon, or in a pasta a la pescatora with black olives, capers, whole peeled tomatoes, zucchini, garlic, onion, leeks and freshly grated parmesan. They are low in calories and pack a lot of protein so one feels full and the best part is they taste great, even just out of the can.

review/text: I just purchased the can from Whole Foods.  I noticed that when opening it, one of the sardines had a strange looking brown spot as if it had been in contact too long with the lid.  Also, I noticed un-uniform color around the back fins; it was and old yellow-like color.  The taste was metallic.

review/summary: It's the Spice of Life
review/text: This is the successor to "Ass in the Tub" which means it is far hotter than a sauce that is already so hot contact with your saliva is like watching boric acid fizz and bubble, only this one really burns. The reference to the posterior is appropriate considering that after ingestion, an eventual exit in this area of human operation may feel like an Apollo Five rocket at ignition, also known as the Blue Flame Syndrome.<br /><br />The contents are cayenne pepper, water, salt, acetic acid, oleoresin cayenne, starch and caramel color. You should note that the formal name for pepper spray is oleoresin capsicum. One teaspoon (you're crazy if you use anywhere near this much) has: 1% your daily allowance of fat, 0% saturated fat, 2 grams of total carbohydrates, or 1%. Protein? None.<br /><br />I have the same 5 oz. bottle I bought four years ago, which shows the enormous respect I have for this product. I take it very lightly which means I don't take it very lightly.<br /><br />If you like flavor, watery eyes, pores opening suddenly to gush forth with droplets of water, and don't mind smoking without a cigarette, this little red heater is just for you.<br /><br />It'll definitely put hair on your chest, even if you already have some!<br /><br />It's the spice of life.

review/summary: Gluten Free Goodness
review/text: I discovered GoPicnic when I was diagnosed with gluten intolerance. I am so happy that Amazon has such a large range of these handy meals. Small enough to go in a purse, but filling enough to substitute for a normal meal, they run about 350 calories per pack. I have tried all the gluten free flavors, but the Tuna and Crackers is my favorite. There's a container of tasty tuna spread, a small bag of multigrain crackers to spread it on, a tub of the BEST apple sauce (Sweet Perry Orchards - not too sweet, terrific apple taste), a bag of fruit and nut mix and a small but delicious square of organic dark chocolate. The box also contains a folding plastic spork for dealing with the tuna spread and the apple sauce. I have a stash of these meals at work, and use them frequently when I am at all day meetings where lunch is provided. Since the lunch is usually not gluten free, I need to be self sufficient, and this gives me enough indulgence not to feel deprived when I see others scarfing down their sandwiches and cookies. I bought them on Subscribe & Save, which brought the price per meal to just over $3, which those of you who buy gluten free anything will recognize as a pretty good deal! Unfortunately, they are currently out of stock on Amazon, but I am hoping they get them back in and continue my monthly delivery.

review/text: I had this meal at an airport because I didn't want to pay $11 for a sandwich.  I paid $6 for this in a shop and it was not very good.  The tuna was the worst quality tuna available.  The nuts were stale (probably been there too long.) Couldn't find a freshness date.  I had to eat it because I bought it and didn't have time to go back for a refund, and I didn't die or get sick, but even fresh the tuna would have been awful.  Don't buy this one.  I would be cautious about buying any of them.  Not the best quality food.

review/summary: Would be 5 stars, except for the bitter dark chocolate...
review/text: We're a Gluten Free family and love GoPicnic meals.  I like dark chocolate, and like that this chocolate is fair trade, but boy is it bitter!  If you eat it with the applesauce it tones it down, but the wife and young kids have trouble eating it.  I actually make the kids eat their chocolate first to make sure they get it down before eating the other stuff.  It is a hard sell for the little ones, especially when they LOVE getting the Almond Roca in some of the other GoPicnic varieties.<br /><br />We purchased the Tuna & Crackers GoPicnic in a different box design in a grocery store this week, and they had changed the chocolate out to a much less bitter variety by way of a little sea salt.  It is better, but still rough for the kids.  I understand that milk chocolate doesn't fare very well in a warm box, but surely they could add at least a bit of sugar to take the edge off.

review/summary: Yummy, but one item produced on wheat equipment!
review/text: I was really excited to find these prepackaged meals just as I was leaving for a trip.  Needing to be GF & traveling across the country can make it a challenge.  Eating at restaurants is always chancy, no airline knows whether or not they have GF food (most don't but you can check the peanuts), and the last thing you want is to be sick on your trip.  So I jumped at ordering these "gluten free" meals when I found them!  And they are pretty good!  It would be nice, since they have a lovely little spork included, if they threw a little napkin in too, but hey, it's not the end of the world.  What IS a bit of a concern for anyone that has to avoid gluten or contain with gluten at all costs is the fact that the chocolate square is NOT gluten free, as marketed.  It is only "no gluten ingredients".  There is a disclaimer on the box that states "Organic Dark Chocolate Square: made on equipment that also produces soy, milk, wheat, peanut, and tree nuts."  You can't do that when the label says "gluten-free" because you can not guarantee the chocolate in GF.  So yes, you could just avoid the chocolate, but I think they either need to put an obvious disclaimer in their product info (all but chocolate are GF or something)or change from the Terra Nostra Organic chocolate to something that truly IS gluten-free.<br /><br />So if you buy it and you know you can't have something produced on shared equipment, just throw out the chocolate.

review/summary: Unusual Hot Sauce
review/text: When Americans want to add some heat to food, we usually think of Mexican or Louisiana style hot sauces.  Sriracha, on the other hand, is a common sauce in Thailand and is named after the largest harbor in that country.  This version, made in California, is a wonderful diversion from Tabasco-like sauces.  Although made with peppers and relatively hot, the sauce has a generous helping of garlic taste that really perks up food.  It's ideal for Asian recipes, but it can be used with any food to which you want to add some heat, including soups, pasta, and chicken wings (the company also has a website that includes some excellent recipes).  The sauce comes in a handy plastic squeeze bottle that is ideal for squirting just the right amount into your food.  If you're tired of the usual old hot sauce, give Sriracha a try.

review/summary: Absolutely Awful Cat Food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler.  Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

I do mix the wrong one with the original but the portions have to be tons more original than different flavor. My kitties are filled out well, their coats are so heavenly soft and shiny. Being able to have it shipped to my door saves me so much in not having to drag the big bag around getting it home.  Thank You, Jill Hahn
