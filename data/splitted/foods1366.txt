review/text: I rate this sauce as hot as 357 Silver edition and Da Bomb ground zero.  It is supposedly hotter than Blairs hottest (non-a.m.) sauce, Ultra Death.  I have a bottle of Ultra Death and I love it, but it still is not as hot as this.  These Zack Wylde sauces feature the same great quality and taste that you would come to expect with all the Blair Products.  I cannot believe how unpopular it is!  try it, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Tastes MUCH better than Bottled.
review/text: I just started using this product, and really like it.  I used to hate lemon juice in a bottle, and if I didn't have a lemon around, I did without.  Now you can have the real taste of lemon with you all the time!.  [...] Though I thought 12 boxes was a lot at first, I've shared with friends, and sent several boxes to our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan as they are always looking for ways to add a little "zip" to their water.  By the way, a single packet in a quart/liter of water does the trick for me, but you can also add a little sweetener if you would like lemonade.  Also try True Lime.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HQR9JW">True Lime Crystallized Lime Mix, 40 Packs, 1.0-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> True Orange just came out, and I hope that Amazon.com will offer it soon as well.

review/summary: Worst tasting Celsius product ever, by far!
review/text: I have had about 9 flavours of Celsius products, which I believe is all of them.<br /><br />My ranking (Best to Worst) based on my preference:<br /><br />Sparkling Ginger Ale<br />Green Tea Peach Mango<br />Strawberry Kiwi<br />Iced Lemon Tea<br />Sparkling Wild Berry<br />Sparkling Orange<br />Sparkling Cola<br />Green Tea Raspberry Acai<br />Apple Orchard (Stevia)<br /><br />The Ginger Ale, Green Tea Peach mango, and Strawberry Kiwi are top notch to me, very tasty!  Everything up to the Cola is really good in my opinion.  The Raspberry Acai doesn't taste nearly as good as the others to me, but most friends like it.  The Apple Orchard is SOOOOOO incredibly BAD that it makes me feel nauseous, and makes me like the Raspberry Acai (which I previously detested) much more.  A friend who usually likes the Stevia sweetener flavour found in the Apple Orchard describe the flavour of Apple Orchard as 'monkey urine.'

review/summary: I hope "Celsius" creates more flavors using Stevia for the sweetener
review/text: Personally, I think the other reviewers must be commenting on some other product, because they're all crazy!!!  While this flavor is not the absolute best of all the flavors, the fact that they used Stevia and Erythritol for sweeteners instead of the fake and "bleached sugar" otherwise known as Sucralose, makes me immensly happy.  The Apple orchard blend tastes like they blended a bunch of different apples and some other sweet flavor and that's what you have.  I am DEFINATELY willing to sacrifice a very small amount on flavor as long as I get the same great product with less harm to my body.

It tastes like a combination of Apple Juice and raw sewage, with a hint of Robitussin to top it off.  Just a horrid after taste.  I could not even finish the can, and I was really happy to find this after they were sold out of the other flavors for a while.  I wish I never found it.  Putrid.

review/summary: I can taste the caffeine
review/text: There are several energy drinks that sweeten with Stevia and taste much better than this one. It's not the Stevia that makes this drink so horrible, it's the caffeine, I can tell. The "Drive" flavor of Vitamin Water has a similar bitter bite except much weaker.<br /><br />This has 200 milligrams of caffeine, which is ridiculous. That's not a magical calorie burning formula, that's a cheap buzz. This stuff sucks.

review/text: I love Celsius.  By love, i mean i drink at least two a day and sometimes more (i suppose I'm pretty addicted at this point).  At any rate, I ignored the warnings of all my fellow reviewers about the taste and boy, was that a terrible mistake.  This stuff really does taste like goat piss or some kind of chemistry experiment gone bad.  I wanted very badly for it to work, as I was feeling like ingesting so much artificial sweetener was probably doing something bad to me, but I can't even gag this stuff down.  Three sips and i poured the can out.  I have 11 cans sitting here, and as it's non-returnable they will be going in the trash. Amazon, you shouldn't carry this crap!  It really tastes AWFUL!!!

review/text: I agree with the others who mentioned this is the worse tasting of all the Celsius drinks.  The price was so cheap so I decided to purchase.  I almost threw up on the first try and couldn't even drink the rest.  Its smell wasn't even appetizing.  But if you decide to keep it and drink it, I would recommend eating a banana or something after drinking to remove that lingering taste off your tongue.

review/text: The other reviewers are being melodramatic.<br /><br />The taste is good - not great - slightly weird aftertaste.  If you like the other Celsisus drinks, I'm not sure how you would find this one so much worse.  Expect a decent tasting drink, trading off some flavor for health, and you won't be disappointed.  I've come to like the taste much more as my taste buds have slowly recovered from years of drinking artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Seriously not worth all the uppercase reviews, exclamation points, and comparisons to "goat piss."

review/summary: It's amazing good!
review/text: I came across my first Celsius marked down at a Walmart. I used to drink one brand of sugary energy drink, because it worked, but so did the Celsius after the first time. It's a fact none of the sugar free energy drinks taste great. However, I thought this brand tasted pretty good. I was glad to be off sugar, but then realized it had sucralose, which I don't want in my body at all. I am so glad for this Celsius which gives me energy all day, and with all natural Stevia! I ordered the 2 cases Amazon had in stock, and will continue to do business as long as they sell it. It is so good, I use it in my Dr. Oz daily smoothie in the mornings, as well as neat, when I don't have time.

Makes me not want to shop through you guys at all smh.<br /><br />*UPDATE<br />Price was lowered to $15.99 so I decided to purchase these, mainly for someone else. I just wanted to save money on them. Overall this product was very delicious & it was very fresh they do not expire until May,2012 which is darn good. So If you have a large family or like handing out free food to your friends then this is great to get.<br /><br />I only rate this  a 4 star because I know I could have gotten these for cheaper if I would have bought them sooner. But when it comes to taste & quality of this product it would get 5 stars.

review/summary: My Favorite Combo
review/text: Yes, the cheddar cheese wrapped in crunchy cracker is my favorite style of Combos. The salty filling actually tastes like real cheese compared to many other snack foods. My favorite methods of eating them is to either chip away at the cracker coating with my teeth until only the strip of cheese remains, or to suck on the cracker until is softens enough to get at the yummy filling.<br /><br />Combos were a staple snack food of mine in high school and college. I rarely eat them these days because, let's face it, they aren't overly healthy. They have some protein, but are loaded with fat, salt and carbs. The ingredient list reads like a dietitians worst nightmare. I challenge anyone with an appetite to stop at the recommended serving of 1/3 of a cup (10-14 pieces).<br /><br />Of course, you don't pop open a bag of Combos for health reasons. It would be wonderful if all of the best tasting food were also really good for you, but that is rarely the case. Sometimes you just have a hankering for a salty, crunchy and hearty snack; and waistline, arteries and blood pressure be d@%mned! For snackers who really want to throw caution to the wind, you should check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AC8HE0">Cheddar Cheese Pretzel</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JHY7C">Pepperoni Pizza Cracker</a> versions as well. Enjoy with your favorite super-sweet carbonated beverage, but you never heard that from me!<br /><br />~ Kort

This is a great complement for me three wolf moon t-shirt<br /><br />A word of warning though, if you leave the penut butter on for too long, it will cause a rift in time sending you back to when you were a loser and didn't have a Nintendo 64 or a three wolf moon t-shirt.

review/summary: a change in lime
review/text: A few months ago, bought from Amazon a 24-pack of these...they were called "avocado oil potato chips with sea salt". Ingredients were:potatoes, all-natural avocado oil, sea salt.  (3 grams protein)<br /><br />Today I bought from Amazon a 24-pack of potato chips called:" avocado oil potato chips Chilean lime".....ingredients are:potatoes,  all natural avocado oil,<br />Whey,<br />Salt,dextrose, sugar, maltodextrin,citric acid, malic acid, vinegar, parsley flakes<br />Buttermilk powder.  (Zero protein)<br />1) Many people have said positive things about ? Which product?<br />2)How can I buy just plain potato chips with avocado oil and sea salt? (brown label, same company)<br />3)So sorry that I can't say these most recent chips are just healthful, nourishing. And great! But they are't great:  so sorry:  Maltodextrin and dextrose are questionable, and add nothing to the original flavor.  Do you have influence to ask the manufacturer to remove dextrose and maltodextrin?  Thanks. Oh, the good old days! Just simple lime chips, no chemicals.  (I can just see the comments that malto...is "GRAS". Still not safe)..

review/summary: Delicious fresher taste with the Avocado Oil
review/text: The Good Health Avocado Oil Potato Chips are delicious!  Every flavor I've tried is delicious including the Chilean Lime which has a strong lime and a just a touch of chile pepper.  The secret to the fresh taste is they don't use the standard sunflower oil and/or safflower oil and/or canola oil and/or some other junk oil.  you can taste the difference in freshness and in high quality oil.  My subscribe-n-save order arrived with 7 months to expiration which means I need to eat at  least one of these lunchbox size bags per week - no problem - they'll probably disappear at the rate of at least one per day!  Delicious!

MAKE A GRAVY WITH THE DRIPPINGS AND ITS WONDERFUL. I HAVE NEVER USED IT FOR ICE CREAM, BUT FOR CAKES AND CUPCAKES TOO. ITS A VERY VERSATILE PRODUCT. IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND IN THE LOCAL STORES, WITH THE OTHER TOPPINGS, I THINK SMUCKERS SHOULD MAKE UP SOME RECEIPES AND PUT IT NEAR THE PRODUCTS I MENTIONED, THE LOCAL STORES MIGHT STOCK THEN, I PURCHASED IT FROM AMAZON.

review/summary: Delicious and different!
review/text: I'm surprised by the review "T. Bates" has left because I think these Nairns dark chocolate chip oat biscuits are delicious.  I have to wonder if s/he has had oat cakes before, because, if so, s/he would have known to expect a somewhat rough, rustic, hearty, and not overly sweet biscuit.  These are nothing like the typical cookies one can buy in American grocery stores.  I love the rich grain taste and texture and the subtleness of the dark chocolate chips.  These are more of an "adult" European biscuit and less of a true cookie.  They are definitely something good for those of us looking for a less processed, different cookie rather than the same old tired options available at the supermarket.

review/text: Yum! This is a new flavor for me, and I am addicted! I love the combination of chocolate and oats, with just the right amount of sweetness and a satisfying crunch. Perfect with a cup of tea or a glass of port. I also really love their stem-ginger and fruit & spice flavors,but this harder-to-find chocolate chip is my new favorite. I agree that the negative reviewer sounds like someone unfamiliar with Nairn's products. I consumed an entire box in less than two days! These are also a real treat for folks like me who can't eat wheat, dairy or eggs; though people with an extreme sensitivity may need to avoid these, Nairn's does make a gluten-free range of oat cakes & biscuits.

review/summary: Basket was never received
review/text: I ordered a basket on December 2, 2009 to be delivered to my daughter during her final exams. First of all, I paid for the basket to be delivered the next day ($30.00) and was notified on December 8th that it was just then being shipped. Second, my daughter NEVER received the basket. I spoke with someone there and they discovered the error in delivery time and refunded the $30.00, however they did say that they would have to do an investigation to find out why the basket was never received. It is now February 6th and I still haven't heard anything about their investigation into the matter.  My daughter, later, went door-to-door asking if anyone had received a study basket and they said 'no'.  Hopefully I will received notification as to why the basket was never delivered and if it was, where was it delivered because it certainly did not reach my daughter's house.  I suppose I will have to wait the outcome of their investigation before I could make a decision as to whether or not I would recommend ordering a Study Basket again.

Dilmah Supreme rated an average on my scale but ah, the English Breakfast! If you wish to have an extra special cup of tea, bold and rich in flavour with subtle nuances, then the English Breakfast is definitely your cup of tea! While more expensive than the Dilmah Premium, it is well worth the price! Enjoy...:)

I would rank Twinings first, followed by Dilmah and then Ahmad.<br /><br />Twinings has the best flavor and comes closest to the classic taste. (Ironically both Ahmad and Dilmah are foiled wrapped while Twinings is not.)<br /><br />Dilmah is decent, but doesn't taste as full bodied as Twinings.<br /><br />I didn't like Ahmad. It tasted more like Dilmah's Ceylon tea than English Breakfast Tea.<br /><br />An aside - I haven't tried Twinings' Earl Grey, but I love Dilmah's Earl Grey. I find its smell and taste very therapeutic after a long and tiring day. In fact, I would prefer it to wine if I'm really tired.

review/summary: Delicious and easy!
review/text: I have only used one bag so far, but I put in a 2-lb salmon fillet glazed with an apple juice reduction and the results were so delicious that my family of three ate the entire fillet in one sitting.  Neither my husband, nor my daughter have ever even liked salmon before.  It was incredibly easy, the directions are very clear, and best of all:  no mess to clean up!

review/summary: great trick and delicious for ribs or brisket.
review/text: I've lived in apartments with no outdoor space for years-- but can always get nicely smoked foods by using these bags.  True, your entire home will smell like wood smoke, but not such a bad thing (you can always undercook a bit, take the meat out and finish it outside the bag if you don't want a strong smell to linger).  The times for cooking and the recipes included on the inside are right on target every time, you really can't go wrong.  Makes wonderful brisket-- I let it cool after cooking, slice it, and then add sauce and reheat.  My friends and I agree that the poultry/fish bags aren't quite as good.<br /><br />The first I tried was a similar import from William's Foods, but they no longer carry these.  Wish I could get them locally, but this works!

review/summary: EASY TO USE GREAT SMOKEY FLAVOR!!!
review/text: I have been using these smoker bags for several years. the first time I used them I bought them from my local Cub foods grocery store. i however now just order them on line since I can get them year around. I have used them on the grill, but mostly inside in the oven. I use them mainly for smoking ribs and turkey legs. They always come out perfect. Everyone compliments me on the flavor and tenderness of the meat. I usually finish them up on the gas grill with barbeque sauce for that perfct taste. I have given these away to friends nd family and they are now using them. I would be really surprised if anyone tried them and didn't like them.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I used a smoker bag to make incredible pulled pork. I used a 6 lb pork shoulder and seasoned it. Placed in the smoker bag at 225. I put mine in the oven at midnight and let it slow roast till 7 am. I was afraid at this low heat it would not get smokey enough but it was perfect. I pulled the pork apart in the juices from the bag and it was as good as any pulled pork I've had.

review/summary: Excellent!!
review/text: To the person who rated this low to due getting just 1 bag...read what you order. Very unfair to rate a product 1 star due to your own error.<br />The bags are great!! So far I've only tried the alder one which gives a lighter taste than the mesquite.<br />*Read the instructions WELL on the INside of the cardboard*<br />I bought a 4-pack of rainbow trout from [...] and rubbed kosher salt inside the fish a couple of hours before cooking. Preheated oven to 475F, placed 1 large cubed zucchini and the 4 fish inside the bag, folded closed and placed on a low rack. Lowered temp to 375F after 15 min and continued for another 25-30 min (3 lbs of fish) = perfection! My kids were crazy about eating "fish tummy" and this couldn't have been any easier to cook or easier to clean up.<br />A very light smoke lingered around the kitchen, but nothing that I'd need to even open the windows for. If the smell is a problem, use your bbq (instructions include oven, coal or gas grill).<br />Too bad the price is such a rip off...these are available for under a buck in Finland.

review/text: I love these bags.  Make the best ribs ever.  I put ribs in the bag with a dry rub according to directions.  After about 1 hour, I take out of oven and let sit for 30 min.  Then I slit the bag down the top, add a gooey sauce and broil or BBQ to brown.  Moist, delicious---everyone raves as the meat falls off the bones.  The whole process takes less than 2 hours.

review/summary: Smoked the house more than the food
review/text: I bought this item based on such good reviews. I thought I would do some ribs in the stove using a smoker bag instead going out in the cold to use the barbeque grill, but what a mistake. I followed the directions exactly and all I got was a smoky house and smoky clothes. The ribs had a weird and faint wood taste not smoky like you get on the grill. YUCK! The ribs were the worst I ever tasted. I usually don't do reviews unless I feel it's necessary and this is one of those times. I really expected to have good results. I give this one TWO THUMBS DOWN.

review/text: Ok I tried this gum at the natural food store which cost me $1 a box and it tasted great and a plus is that it is all natural without chemicals like aspartame and all of that. The flavor does not last long BUT if that is a must then you will go through these packs very quickly looking for a sugar rush. I love this gum as a digestive aid after eating, to produce enough saliva for digesting protein and carbs, and it works great. I can't tolerate the additives that most gums and candy have so as long as I can chew on this gum I am happy. Hope this gum stays around and amazon prices are wonderful!

I purchased this to avoid things that are not good for you and that is why it got four stars.  If you want a healthy gum this is the best I have found so far. The Glee tangerine better, but get both for variety.<br /><br />Pros: Not harmful and has good flavor while it lasts.<br /><br />Cons: The flavor does not last more than three minutes with three pieces and it is sticky compared with regular gum.

review/text: It took awhile, but I finally found a gum that doesn't contain cancerous chemicals. Unfortunately, at least for this flavor, my search isn't over.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />+ This flavor tastes really good. Fruity.<br />+ There's no artificial anything.<br />+ You won't be risking cancer by chewing this gum.<br />+ It's relatively cost effecient.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />- The sweetness lasts for less than 1 minute. Seriously.<br />- After 1 minute the flavor is gone and you'll have to eat another piece just to maintain some level of sweetness.<br /><br />That's it. Therein lies the biggest problem. This flavor isn't for sweetening your breath. It's for dessert and it only lasts approximately 30 seconds. I can eat half the box in 10 minutes and feel compelled to do so because it tastes so good.<br /><br />Maybe the mint flavor lasts longer? Or perhaps Spry gum is a better fit?

Shaped like the old Chiclets gum, but without all the toxic ingredients most commercial gums now contain. Real chicle and natural flavorings amount to a good product. The gum flavor is not artificial hence not as long-lasting as some, but does provide a nice burst of flavor and a good firm chew. Would definitely buy this product again. The only improvement I can think of would be in the box design, which has a tendency to open in your purse if you're not careful. As a side note, the graphics on the box are so retro & fun!
