review/text: OMG - can't even believe these are sugar free! Lots of great flavors, there's not one I would choose ove the other. Fresh! These are really a treat. I wish they came in smaller bags because they are hard to put down once the bag is open. These disappear quickly at our house. Great Product.

review/summary: Wow! I liked them all.
review/text: Emigrating often means giving up on certain life-long pleasures found only in the old country.  Like my mother's home-made rusks, so fresh that they would crumble and break when dunked too long in coffee (or tea).  But that's why we had teaspoons - to scoop the rusks out of the coffee (or tea) cup.  What joy.  Sadly, that was more than 9 years ago.<br /><br />Thankfully, I recently discovered biscotti.  Not just any old biscotti, but biscotti from Biscotti Goddess.  I must admit that a biscotti is not exactly a rusk (check your dictionary), nor is Biscotti Goddess `as mother made it'.  Yet, biscotti from Biscotti Goddess is much more than just a substitute.<br /><br />I ordered the "Assortment of Gluten Free Gourmet Handmade Biscotti".  Wow!  A good starter pack, except it did not help me to identify a favorite.  I liked them all, from vanilla dipped in dark chocolate to orange cranberry to lemon poppy to anise & almond.  Maybe I'll just stick with the assortment and dip in for a pleasant flavor surprise.  You should, too.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005PG0NOC">Assortment of Gluten Free Gourmet Handmade Biscotti (12 1.5oz Sticks)</a>

review/summary: most delicious gummies!
review/text: I love these gummi bears.  They are consistently firm and bursting with flavor.  They are not mushy and bland like the other leading American brands and off-brand candies.  They are still soft, but they are not too squishy.  If you like firm bears, these are for you!  They are also much more flavorful than other gummi bears I have tried.  I am not positive that Haribo uses real fruit juice, but I think they do.  It tastes like they do.  Each color of gummi (I think there are 5 colors) has a unique and delicious flavor.  Unlike many of the other brands of gummi bears available on the market, which often taste the same and are not as interesting.  Haribo bears are sometimes available at the "regular" grocery stores, but you can definitely find them at World Market.  I highly recommend theses bears to anyone that would like a more delectable gummi bear.

review/summary: Flavorful, Garlic-Heavy Steak Rub
review/text: As with pretty much any other steak rub, seasoning, or sauce, garlic dominates Grill Mates' steak rub.  Notably, it only has barely half the sodium in their "25% less sodium" Montreal Steak seasoning, which allows it to avoid the overly saltiness of Montreal Steak.  It's also more flavorful.  It has the perfect consistency for a rub (in contrast with the pork rub, which I find too "thin").  In fact, it's my favorite of all the Grill Mates seasonings I've tried.

It taste even better than beef jn my opinion. Most people wouldn't even know the difference.<br />As far as this product is concerned, I only gave it 4 Stars because of the description. They are not individually wrapped but are in packs of 5. The do contain a very small amount of beef. And you get 10 (2 packs) of Smoked Bratwurst and 10 (2 packs) of Bar b que flavored Bratwurst.<br />They are not cheep at a bit more than $3 a piece but your health is worth the expense.

review/text: Its not always about the heat, sometimes its about the blend, and this "Extra Hot" Sauce<br />from Melinda's has one of the freshest and cleanest tastes of all the major brands.<br /><br />All pepperheads know there's a sauce out there for everything, and this stuff really shines<br />on veggies and fish, two things you wouldn't necessarily put something like Tabasco or a<br />heavier darker blend of habanero, et.al. Now, this stuff is not vinegary as someone noted,<br />its heavy on the carrots and a little thicker than most of its counterparts. I can't taste<br />any vinegar at all for that matter so I'm not sure where that comment came from.<br /><br />Use this to enhance the flavor of foods, not to blow the top of your head off. If you like<br />the flavor of this stuff and want something hotter then Melinda's makes a XXXXtraHot brand<br />that should suit your evolving needs for a good burn.

I've been taste testing a dozen or so hot sauces over the last few months (Dave's, Brother Bru Bru, Castillo, Fontina, several more), and this is by far my least favorite. It is also the cheapest per bottle, so that may be a redeeming factor.

review/summary: Essential for Us Louisiana and Texas Foodies
review/text: Tabasco is an important staple in Louisiana and Texas pantries.  We like it on scrambled eggs for breakfast.  When we have barbecued pork sandwiches for lunch, we like them extra hot; so we sprinkle on some Tabasco.  Many of our restaurants have bottles of it on the table with the salt and pepper.<br /><br />Tabasco is a natural with collard greens.  In The Collard Patch we use it on all kinds of dishes with collards.  Several of the recipes in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook contain Tabasco.  Here's one we like:<br /><br />Crawfish and Shrimp Bread<br />1 loaf French bread, split lengthwise<br />1 stick butter (� pound)<br />6 ounces Philadelphia� Cream Cheese<br />1 pound crawfish tails, cooked<br />1 pound shrimp, cooked and peeled<br />1 pound Colby cheese, shredded<br />Dash of Tabasco�<br />2 splashes Pick a Peppa� sauce<br />Dash of crushed red pepper<br /><br />Melt the butter and add the cream cheese, heating and blending until smooth. Add the Tabasco� and Pick a Peppa�.  Add the crawfish tails and shrimp.  Heat approximately 5 minutes: do not let boil.  Spread the mixture over the bread.<br /><br />Heap mounds of shredded cheese over the crawfish.  Lightly sprinkle a dash of crushed red pepper over the mixture.<br />Bake at 375� for about 5 minutes.  Cut into 1-inch wedges.<br />----<br />When we say a dash of Tabasco, we mean as much as we want.  For us Spice Mouths, it is a big old shake of it.<br /><br />I must confess that we enjoy all the flavors of Tabasco, and we grab whichever bottle is handy.<br />----<br />Our idea of entertainment is to go to the Avery Island Tabasco plant south of Lafayette, Louisiana.  We highly recommend this powerful and pure seasoning.

review/summary: A fine product!
review/text: I always stay at least "two ahead" on my inventory of Tabasco sauce. I use a LOT of it as a key ingredient certain dishes, and I cook "from scratch" every day. It has an excellent pepper flavor, (no bad or other dubious "off taste" such as you'll find in some other brands), and Tabasco is somewhat more concentrated than, say, Frank's RedHot, (which is also an excellent product).<br /><br />Tabasco holds up very good in cooking, making its superior and unique flavor and spicy heat known at the end of cooking time in dishes such as chili, huevos rancheros, etc.<br /><br />But there are some specific recipes which call ABSOLUTELY for Tabasco as a seasoning/condiment/garnish, and other pepper sauces, (and I have tried MANY!), simply produce an inferior dish. These specific recipes/dishes include the following:<br /><br />1. Cincinnati Chili (a delicious and hearty "chili over spaghetti" dish, sold at restaurants such as: Gold Star, Skyline, Empress, and/or Dixie chili. You can also make it from scratch at home)<br /><br />2. Bloody Mary cocktails<br /><br />3. chilis rellenos (these are usually made with either Anaheim or Poblano peppers which, in themselves, aren't very spicy hot -- a few drops of Tabasco on top definitely improves the dish)<br /><br />4. Shrimp diablo (grilled, or in a pasta-with-sauce dish)<br /><br />Tabasco is also a great choice for any other recipe which calls for "hot sauce" or "pepper sauce" as an ingredient, although you may wish to use only about 1/3 as much Tabasco as you would any standard pepper sauce.<br /><br />Be aware that many of these discount price hot sauces and pepper sauces often yield some very dubious FLAVORS, so, such "bargains" can compromise an entire recipe! With Tabasco, you'll always be safe on that front.<br /><br />By the way, if you want great (free) recipes for any of the above items which I mentioned, you can go to my public recipe page at Recipezaar. My screen name at that site is "Bone Man" and I have about 300 recipes posted there.<br /><br />My highest recommendation for this fine product!

review/text: I just asked my daughter, who is the hot sauce lover in the house, what her favorite hot sauce is. Hands down, this is it.<br />It's a classic addition to many recipes, and a wonderful condiment. The sharp vinegar/spicy taste is also a nice addition to homemade salad dressings and a little helps out marinades as well.<br />I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy foods, so I'll add a bit in when I'm cooking, then leave the bottle on the table for the spice addicts to add more to their tastes. In small amounts it adds nice flavor without being too much heat for me.<br /><br />My daughter likes it on ramen, with peanut butter on sandwiches, and wants to work with me on a Tabasco cookie recipe.

If you're planning to do something similar and can't find this on Amazon, you can also go to Wal-Mart / Target to find them at a decent rate. But, they only have about 20 bottles on the shelves at a time. So, you'll have to go back multiple times. I speak from experience. :)

review/summary: Matcha on the money
review/text: This matcha powder mixes easily and has a very pure and authentic matcha taste without added sweetners. I add this matcha powder to Island Tea's green tea frappuccino mix with added sugar. It's the closest thing to a Starbucks Latte. By mixing both products I can really control the level of sweetness and the strength of the green tea. I also add unsweetened soy milk .

review/summary: Pure Cotton Candy
review/text: I really love cotton candy. It brings me right back to my childhood: days spent running around carnivals all summer, wishing I was one of the girls in the sparkly dresses riding on elephants. Of course I'd love to have it all the time now, but it's really not that great for you. I mean, it's literally pure sugar! And food dye. So, I just had to get some cotton candy matcha! The idea of cotton candy that is actually good for you, how can I turn that down?<br /><br />The taste of this is SO good. I can't believe it tastes so much like cotton candy! If you told me my glass had melted cotton candy in it with some matcha, I'd believe you because it is that good. AND with no sugar at all! Just water and matcha. And the taste lingers, my mouth was all cotton candy-y for a good half hour after I finished. This is just... it's so good. If you like cotton candy you owe it to yourself to try this one out right now. Seriously!

review/summary: Cotton Candy - YUM!
review/text: Cotton Candy Match!  To say I'm excited is an understatement!  I loved Cotton Candy as a kid and still at the age of thirty-seven will buy cotton candy when I see it.  My hubby humors my childlike excitement.<br />My first encounter with this matcha was heaven!  I opened up the pouch, preparing it for the tin that will keep in the yummy goodness.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.<br />I unpacked my matcha bowl that I specifically as for at Christmas time so that I could properly prepare matcha.  Then came the chasen from its tight plastic case.  Since this was its first use I warmed it up a bit under water, sitting in the bowl.  I think part of what I love about matcha is the preparation that feels very ceremonial.  All items ready...bowl, chasen, matcha and water!<br />First I mixed 2 oz of water with 1 perfect teaspoon of matcha. Of course in my preparation I was so excited and almost forgot to sift it first..disaster avoided!  Once that was properly mixed I added a teeny bit of sugar (this is cotton candy of course) and 6 oz of water.  After I properly exhausted any strength from my whipping right hand I was ready.<br />The smell of this matcha is not as strong once mixed with water.  The taste is there though!  The quality of this matcha is very tasty.  It doesn't taste too vegetal or clash with the sweetness off the cotton candy.  I think next time I will add just a bit more sugar as I didn't want to go overboard the first time and not really get  the original taste of the matcha.<br />My plan for the rest of Cotton Candy is to mix it first as a latte.  Then, try adding to my health food drink which is a vanilla base.  So I'll be back to let you know how that works out!<br />To get your own tasty Cotton Candy Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]<br />In closing - YUM!!!!

review/summary: Tastes like it should be served at the carnival!
review/text: We all love cotton candy, right?  I mean, really ... who doesn't love the stuff?  There is nothing that is more evocative of a carnival or fair than cotton candy, and that's where the best cotton candy is found.  But THIS Cotton Candy Matcha tastes like it should be served right alongside the corn dogs and popcorn at the carnival!<br /><br />It really tastes like Cotton Candy & Matcha!  The matcha tastes like I'd expect it to:  bittersweet (although with the cotton candy flavor, the sweetness is really enhanced even more than usual) with vegetative tones, and a buttery undertone.  It tastes creamy and has a rich, smooth texture (no chalkiness!)<br /><br />And then the cotton candy ... it tastes, well, like Cotton Candy!  It is sugary sweet and delicious.  All that's missing is that texture:  fluffy, cottony feel on the tongue followed by a light crunch.  But, I'm willing to trade that in for the health benefits of the Matcha!<br /><br />This stuff is AWESOME!  You've gotta try it!

review/text: Its so nice to have these delectable treats in matcha form, thus healthy, and yet feel so satisfied by them! All the pleasure none of the guilt! Although I admit I do mix mine with milk and sometimes use creamer to make a latte but gah its still better than the real stuff!<br />This has just the right amount of sweetness to it yet still allows me to feel as though I am getting that green tea goodness!<br />I can't imagine anyone not loving this tea and it seems any tea that has Cotton Candy in the name has been a favorite of mine but then again this is only the second one I have found and this is the ONLY matcha! I can't even make the entire cup last through this review its THAT good!

review/summary: Just like the fair!
review/text: There was no way in the world I was not picking up this matcha blend. I've had some great tasting cotton candy teas in the past so I knew it could be done! Also, I have this vast collection of cotton candy flavoured drink recipes to be made - and remade - matcha style! Pinterest can be very inspiring! The one that is most intriguing in a cotton candy lemonade, where you just pour sweet lemonade over a glass full of cotton candy. Has anyone ever tried matcha lemonade? That is pretty much what this matcha was MADE for, and I wish I had some friends to come have a summer party so I could make some and not get heartburn from drinking the whole pitcher. So, you're invited! Just let me know when you're coming so I can clean!<br /><br />Yay! This Cotton Candy matcha takes me to my happy place! Fun times at the fair under a hot blue sky - that is what cotton candy is to me. I got the basic matcha with the delicate flavouring and it is just perfect! So much yummy cotton candy flavour - and it really blows my mind, because it doesn't just taste generally sweet and sugary - it actually tastes like spun sugar! Bright pink and blue spun sugar that just melts on your tongue.<br /><br />I enjoyed this flavour of matcha hot - but it also made a very refreshing and energizing iced tea. Since Cotton Candy is such a summer flavour, I was happy to have it by my side on a sweltering hot day. It is especially good sprinkled on some real vanilla icecream. Have you ever tried cotton candy ice cream? It's usually made with a pretty cheap ice cream brand, and although it's usually delicious anyways, it doesn't even hold a candle to a high quality ice cream sprinkled with this wonderfully flavoured cotton candy matcha. A cold, sweet treat on a hot day!

review/summary: Cotton Candy
review/text: Guh, cotton candy. This was the flavor I most looked forward to, and it's the one I ripped into and gleefully made a cup as soon as the package arrived. So much for my nap, I have matcha to drink! I didn't even read the description on the site, it just instantly wound up in my cart. Cotton candy is childhood to me, as well as a good number of college years spent drinking cotton candy cosmos. I can hear my mother in my head right now. "No, you can't get cotton candy, if we're going to pay $5 for a snack, it's going to be something more than just spun sugar!" But rarely she would cave and oh man. Oooooh man. I remember at one company picnic, they had a cotton candy machine, and you could have all the cotton candy you wanted. They even showed you how to make it! It was amazing. It was the ultimate snack of my childhood. Fast forward a few years to the summer between my first and second year of college. I had an apartment with three other girls, two of whom I didn't know, and I was working at Beech Bend Park. Now, if you know where that is, you either a) went to Western Kentucky University or b) are a biker, because it's adjacent to the Beech Bend racetrack and the Beech Bend Campground, where Harley days are held every year. Usually, I got stuck working the teacups (ironic, huh?), but every once in a while, I got to work food services and I got to make the cotton candy. Oh my goodness. Heaven. Hot work, but heaven. A year or two later I went to O'Charley's with a friend and spotted the Cotton Candy Cosmo on the menu. Unable to resist anything cotton candy, I had to try out. Out came a martini glass overflowing with fresh cotton candy. A little shaker contained vodka and when your poured the vodka over the cotton candy, it melted and mixed in so beautifully that you forgot you were drinking way too much alcohol.<br /><br />Now it's my go-to snack when the wife takes me to the movies. It's $3 and it makes my inner kid go bouncing all over the place. This tea does the same thing. It's...it's amazing how much it really does taste like cotton candy, especially when cold. The cooler my cup got, the more it tasted like those little fluffy clouds of heaven. You can still taste the matcha, and it has an odd creaminess to it, but it's just...wow. Wow. It all blends together and it even has that burnt sugar bit at the end of the sip. I'm going to take a cup of this to the Zoo next Tuesday, ride the carousel, and just go back in time to the carnivals and theme parks of my youth.

review/summary: The best tasting, best looking salt for a salt grinder
review/text: I've tried many types and brands of salt for use in a salt grinder.  This one, hands down, is the best.  It has an attractive scattering of reddish granules intermixed, presumably because of the many trace minerals in the salt.  I believe the taste is significantly better than any other salt I've tried, whether mined or evaporated (perhaps because of the trace minerals).  The salt granules seem to be harder than other brands, so a good grinder will be required (I use two styles of grinders from Wm. Bounds).  There is also a Kosher grind and a fine grind available, but I don't have experience with them.

review/summary: Perfect for Seitan
review/text: Bob's Red Mill Gluten Flour is perfect for making seitan.  Your success will depend on the recipe that you use.  An online search for "seitan recipes" will net you several, including videos showing the steps to success.  Here is my Chicken-ish Seitan Patties recipe.<br /><br />Chicken-ish Seitan Patties<br /><br />Dry Ingredients:<br />1 cup gluten flour<br />2 TBS garbanzo bean flour<br />2 TBS nutritional yeast<br />1/4 tsp thyme<br />1/2 tsp rosemary<br />1 tsp sage<br />1/2 tsp marjoram<br />1 tsp onion powder<br />Pepper to taste<br /><br />Wet ingredients:<br />2 TBS cashew butter<br />2 Edward & Sons Not-Chick'n Bouillon Cubes<br />1 +/- cup cold water<br /><br />Mix all of the dry ingredients and set aside. I used 4 turns of the pepper mill. I grind the rosemary and thyme with a pestle in a mortar before adding to the dry ingredients.<br /><br />Mix all of the wet ingredients. I put all of the wet ingredients into a personal blender and mixed it up. Add the blended wet ingredients to the dry and mix well. If necessary, add additional water. If the mixture is a bit sloshy at this point, you've added too much water. This can be fixed with the addition of a tiny bit of gluten. I also let the mixture set for a couple of minutes to let the water be absorbed.<br /><br />Measure out some aluminum foil squares approximately 8 inches wide. Measure out a heaping 1/4 cup of the mixture onto the middle of your foil. Pat the mixture down into a patty, then fold the aluminum foil making a tight pouch. Continue until all of the gluten mixture is used up. I believe that I got 6 patties out of the mixture.<br /><br />Place packets into a steamer and steam over boiling water for approximately 35 minutes. Remove from heat. The patties can be used at this point however you wish.<br /><br />Possible changes: Tahini can be used in place of the cashew butter. Obviously any kind of chicken bullion can be used.

review/text: This is a good product (though I haven't yet seen bad gluten...). I use it mostly for seitan and sometimes in baking. I only wish there was an organic version available.

review/summary: A Trip Back to our Childhood in the 80's
review/text: I bought this for my brother for his birthday.  We were both raised in the 80's and he called me as soon as he received it (which told me he was really impressed).  He loved it.  We talked about the candy included and how we would hide the candy from our parents.  They particularly did not like the candy cigarettes that we loved.  He said it included all of his favorites from the 80's, apple heads, pixy sticks, jaw breakers, pop rocks, Mike and Ikes, etc.  He can be a little hard to shop for and this one was a hit.<br /><br />The shipping charge was a little extreme so be prepared to pay quite a bit for shipping, but my brother's response was worth it.

review/summary: Pero, Inka, Cafix review...
review/text: I bought a case of all three products, Inka, Pero and Cafix in order to compare them. Honestly? They are all the same, so go with whatever is the cheapest. I think I did like Cafix the best, but it may be a mental thing with the name at least sounding somewhat like Coffee. There is little difference in all three, they look identical with only tiny coloration differences. All by themselves they do not taste like coffee and if you are a black coffee drinker? Pass, because you will not be satisfied with the taste. It is very bland all by itself. BUT, if you like cream in your coffee? You won't even notice the difference between coffee and these products within a week or two you will forget you are not drinking coffee. I am PERFECTLY happy with all three products and will continue to drink them;I will choose by PRICE due to the very similar make of them all. The cans all read the same ingredient wise.

review/summary: Odd bitter taste; not like Postum.
review/text: If you are looking for a substitute for the discontinued Kraft hot drink mix Postum, Pero doesn't taste much like Postum.  Postum had a much smoother, slightly sweet taste.  Pero has a  bitter flavor, which to me tastes like stale coffee.  If you are a coffee drinker and want to cut down on caffeine, a good decaf coffee tastes much better than Pero.<br /><br />By the way, Postum was made from from wheat bran, wheat, molasses, and maltodextrin made from from corn.  The ingredients of Pero are malted barley, barley, and chicory; so it is quite different.

review/text: I like Pero. This not coffee, nor will there be anything like coffee, without the caffeine. Compared to coffee, Pero has a more bland taste. Not that it doesn't have flavor, it does. Just not like coffee. But the more I drink, the more I enjoy. It has its own unique flavor. Much better than Teccinno (Yuk!).  There are no side effects and no caffeine. Since I gave up caffeine, my energy has returned and I require less sleep, amazingly. And, at age 41, it is an unexpected blessing. Thanks Pero!

However, if you like that brown hot beverage in the morning and you can't drink coffee, it is really nice. I wish I could buy it at my supermarket so I wouldn't have to pay so much for shipping. This site wants to say that I bought it from Amazon, however, my purchase was processed through Amazon, but because it was not an Amazon product, I paid approx 50% more in shipping.

I had a lot of foam on top.<br />One cup was enough - I'll go back to Caffix.<br />I like Caffix better if I mix instant decaf with it. A ratio of 2/3 Caffix to 1/3 instant decaf. Much better.

I also was concerned regarding the process used to make decaf coffee.  This is a healthy option.

review/summary: natural alternative to coffee
review/text: I used to drink cups of coffee but it gave me diarrhea.  My job at a nuclear power plant at night demands that I sit for long periods and can not take bathroom breaks frequently.  I looked for a natural alternative to coffee.<br /><br />PERO is what I found.  It is about $5 a can, which is said to make 175 cups.  The taste isn't the most exhilarating but it's okay on cold days with cookies or burnt toast.  I use milk, not water as I'll vomit if I use water.  In all, it's healthy and a basic drink and suffer from stomach cramps or tied up intestines.  I have 5 cups a day, along with a carton of French cigarettes.

Boil one cup of water.<br /><br />2. Place four tea bags in the water and brew for about 15 minutes. (I use a quart size Pyrex measuring cup.)<br /><br />2. If you want sweetened iced tea-- dissolve about 3 Tablespoons of sugar in the hot tea. Otherwise, just proceed and use artificial sweetener later, if desired.<br /><br />3. Add three cups of cold water to the brewed hot tea.  Stir.<br /><br />4. Now here's the special element: add sliced oranges to the tea-- or put an orange slice on each glass (instead of the traditional lemon).  The orange adds a great complimentary flavor to the tea.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/text: Exir, Saffron Honey is the best tasting honey I have ever tasted and I love honey.  It is sweet and smooth. The health benefits are 100% true.  I am a witness to its calming effect.  Saffron is a wonder herb, but the saffron honey is the cheapest way to get the health benefits of saffron.  The herb is very expensive, but the honey is priced modestly.  It is worth the money. I have a mental disorder and it helps me focus and give me energy that last all day.  I was researching ways to improve my overall health through diet and I read that saffron was tremendously healthly so I bought the honey. It was more than I expected.  I tried a more expensive honey from a health food website, but this product gave me more results and its taste better.  I add it to my tea and breakfast cereal.  Yummy! I highly recommend this product.

I've never wanted mayo or liked mayo straight from the jar, but this was freaking delicious. I didn't have a lot, so the taste probably gets old quick if you eat a lot from the jar, but I highly recommend this mayo. (The tuna salad with this mayo in it was rockin' too).

review/text: My vet recommended my 11 year old cat change her diet due to her blood work came back as her numbers were slightly elevated... Vet said to help maintain that her kidneys filter properly, i put her on a special canned food. Thank God she loves this food!! Purina Kidney Function seems to be the one she is liking thus far. Tried SCience Diet,and she walked away. I recommend this food for your pet..

review/summary: This coffee is good, but what Amazon sells isn't fresh
review/text: We have been buying this coffee for a couple of years now.  We usually buy it directly from Community, but saw that is was about half the price on Amazon.  There's a reason for that....old coffee with an old and bitter taste.  We canceled our subscription from Amazon and are going back to the source for our coffee.

review/summary: Best coffee ever.....
review/text: I first tasted this coffee in Lafayette, LA...Louisiana being the home of this brand of coffee.  I've tried them all and this is by far the smoothest, tastiest and most mellow of anything I've used before to make my coffee!  I recommend it highly!

review/summary: Good tasting, honest coffee
review/text: The reason I put 'honest' in the title is that it is hard to find a coffee now-a-days that is not ground too fine and sold in 10 or 11 ounce packages as a replacement for a 16 ounce package. The finer grinds tend to be over extracted when brewing in a drip coffee maker, which most of us use. Over extraction creates a bitter tasting coffee. End of that story.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black, no sugar, no cream. A good coffee does not need anything to enhance the flavor,... except maybe, a little roasted chicory sometimes.<br /><br />This coffee comes in 16 ounce packages and appears to be a medium/course grind. In my drip brewer, it makes about the best tasting coffee that I have had in in a long time.<br /><br />The coffee I received, had a 'use by' date that was 9 months into the future, it is fresh. It came packaged in a vacuum sealed, inner foil, outer plastic container. They had managed to seal the package into the shape of a brick, easy storage.<br /><br />Would I recommend this to a friend?<br />My best friends are actually going to get a package of this coffee, with the suggestion to just try it ;)<br /><br />Enjoy

review/summary: Best Coffee
review/text: Community Coffee is the best. I started drinking this coffee when I lived in Louisiana and have continued as I have moved around. I cannot always buy it in the areas I have lived so I have had it shipped to me.  The Between Roast has a wonderful taste. It is strong enough without a bitter taste. I have sold several people on purchasing the coffee.  Given it as a gift and they want more. It is a coffee you really must try.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAQDKM">Community Coffee Ground Coffee, Between Roast, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 10)</a>

review/summary: Community Coffee on Amazon subscription
review/text: Community Coffee is my favorite coffee, and has been for 20 years. When I moved to SC from Texas, I requested that my local grocery carry it, which they did for quite some time. But then, they stopped carrying it, and I was thrilled to find I could order it on Amazon, by the case, at a reasonable price through the subscription option... 10 lbs a month, which works just fine for me and my family. For those of us who no longer live along the Gulf Coast, the subscription option is a fabulous solution...<br /><br />BTW, it is best made in a good electric percolator like Presto - (prob. also available on amazon!).
