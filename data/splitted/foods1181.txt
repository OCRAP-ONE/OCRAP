review/summary: The taste leaves much to be desired
review/text: I purchased these for my vegetarian college student with Subscribe and Save.  They were a bit pricey, but as a parent, it at least seemed like a good balanced meal for her (an edamame AND hummus lover) to have on hand.  She didn't like it .. at all.  She said everything tasted "funny" (her word) except for the little fruit pack and told me to cancel the Subscribe and Save subscription for them, because it was a waste of my money.

review/summary: Warning on Gluten -
review/text: This is a nice convenient package, and the hummus and crackers are a good combo. However, while the contents of the packages are gluten free, both the chocolate and the nut mix are produced on equipment that also processes wheat. So, if you have celiac disease or are very sensitive to gluten, these two items are not completely gluten free.

review/summary: Good tasting, but not a good value.
review/text: Let me be clear, I thought the GoPicnic meals tasted good and were incredibly filling for the small amount of food in the kit. This is not to mention that the food provided is relatively healthy.<br /><br />My complaint comes in with the sheer cost of these meals. At around $4.16 per meal, this only becomes a good value only to those eating either very high-end foods or going out to eat for lunch every day. If you already take your lunch to school or work, chances are that your existing lunch is cheaper than it would be through GoPicnic.<br /><br />While Amazon gives a 15% discount and a $1.00 coupon, this still doesn't make it too much better. You're almost certainly better off buying hummus and crackers in bulk and portioning it out into lunches than by going this route. If you'd rather have convenience and don't mind paying a premium for it, then GoPicnic may be for you.

review/summary: bad quality
review/text: I can't give this a negative rating, so I'll give it 1 star. First, be sure to carry power tools, you'll need them to get into the package. The chocolate was old and turning white. The dry roasted soybeans tasted like they were mummified. The crackers have the qualities of gypsum and the hummus only looked like hummus, it tasted like it was made of water, lemon juice and agar. The only thing good in the box is the Baja Blend, which was excellent but is available separately from Amazon. Now I need to find someone hungry enough to give the rest to.<br /><br />I will be ordering more of this !<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W8ETXU">Sweet Perry Orchards Baja Blend Fruit & Nut Mix - 10 Pack</a>

review/text: everything inside is packaged and labelled, how is it possible that the cumulative nutrition "facts" on the whole package is wrong?  i noticed this when i was checking out the calcium contents (0 listed on the package, each component has some), i didn't bother trying to add up all the calories, fat grams, sugars, etc.  this whole package is an expensive assortment of snacks, not really a picnic, probably convenient for an airplane.  took these on a 12 mile hike, i wouldn't recommend this if you are looking for a meal replacement.

review/summary: Unhealthy, unfilling and expensive!
review/text: The only reason I bought this was because I could buy it with a special 50% discount, therefore getting 6 boxes of it at half price of $ 20.80 seemed to be a good deal to me.  How wrong I was!  I was surprised to see its price jumped up to $ 22.15 when I wrote this review (cheaper when buy it via subscribe and save) which comes to about $ 3.69 a box, still cheaper than its price of $ 3.99 (plus sales tax) in my local Target.  However, the problem was when I opened its BIG box up, there were only five tiny packages: a small pack of hummus dip, a small pack of multi-seed crackers, a small pack (0.75 oz) of fruit and nut mix, a small pack of Dry Roasted Edamame and a very tiny (0.43 oz) roast dark 60% cacao organic dark chocolate.  Unless you eat like a bird, there is no way this box can serve as anything but a snack, a very small one.<br /><br />(1) Hummus dip and multi-seed crackers - there is 13 gram of fat (3 gram saturated fat) in the hummus dip, however the biggest problem is its large content of salt (450 gm sodium).  It tasted so salty (bitter) that it completely ruined the taste of the hummus.  If you eat this dip everyday, you would have high blood pressure for sure.  Now the crackers are quite good but there are really only a few of them.<br /><br />(2)Baja Blend fruit nut mix - I was surprised to see it has 5 gm of fat and 9 gm of sugar in such a tiny bag (0.75 oz or 21 gm).  It tastes quite sweet, a little bit tart and wow, spicy HOT! It burned my tongue.  A very strange mix, not too bad but very unusual and I am not sure I want to repeat the experience. I could not figure out where the hot spice comes from even after I read its package repeatedly.<br /><br />(3) Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame - quite healthy, only 150 gm of sodium and 4 gm fat (0.5 gm saturated).  It tasted pretty good but no different than any roasted edamame you can buy yourself.  It would be much cheaper.<br /><br />(4)Chocolate - yes, its is supposed to be organic, but strange enough it will not tell you how much sugar or fat it has.  The chocolate piece's outside is also whitish, to me that may be a sign of the chocolate becomes too old or? How does it taste? It taste like anything but chocolate.  I do not believe I can eat more than a bite of it.<br /><br />Therefore, not trying to bad mouth this product, but why would I want to pay about $ 3.69 to pay for a box of something that is not healthy, not filling, not tasting good unless, well, you want to lose weight.  I believe if you would eat it as your meals everyday, you will be almost guaranteed to lose weight because you would simply discard the whole box before you can finish them and will still feel hungry.

review/summary: Starting to lose faith in hopped Cooper's kits.
review/text: I just finished brewing my 10th batch of homebrew. 3 of which were pre-hopped Cooper's kits like this.  One was terrible (Australian Draught), and two were barely drinkable (Australian Ale and English Bitter).<br /><br />The other batches I brewed with Briess, Northern Brewer, or Coopers malt extract and hopped myself, and all have been awesome.  100% yummy beer.<br /><br />I've tried to nail down why these were so lousy.  The worst batch I brewed with 2lbs of dextrose, and only fermented for two weeks.  We could probably write that one off as cheap ingredients meets bad technique.  But the other two were brewed with dry malt extract and fermented for 3-4 weeks.  My best guess is that the kits were old.  Something is obviously wrong.  Under the same brewing/fermentation methods and using the exact same yeast my other batches have all been great.<br /><br />Anyway, I guess I'd suggest avoiding the hopped kits entirely.  I certainly won't be buying them again.  At the very least I would recommend using all malt extract and checking the dates on the cans.  These kits are definitely more convenient, but cost more and taste a lot worse.  To me an extra 45 minutes of effort is totally worth it.

review/summary: Makes "Twinkies" taste like fertilizer
review/text: It really is a shame that the Tastykake Brand has only established itself in the Northeastern portion of the U.S.A., being that the rest of the world is missing out on the finest pre-packaged snack pastry on the face of this earth.  For those who are unfortunate enough not to know what a Tastykake is, it's like a Little Debbie or a Hostess, which is centered out of the Philadelphia area.  And should you happen to run into anybody from the Philadelphia area and ask them about this line of products, they will inevitably tell you that once you've experienced the snack God that is the Tastykake Butterscotch Krimpet, those Drake's Coffee Cakes and Hostess Twinkies will no longer have any appeal.<br /><br /> It's hard to put into words just how fantastic these spongey, moist, and vanilla butterscotch frosted guys are.  Seriously, the Butterscotch Krimpet can even beat out many fresh baked bakery products, despite being mass manufactured and factory sealed in boxes.  I seriously suggest grabbing a big jug of chocolate milk and ordering a box of these on Amazon right now, especially if you're not from the Mid-Atlantic region and are under the false assumption that Hostess is a quality product.  If so, you will be blown away by the krimpet's culinary goodness.<br /><br /> Tastykake's seemingly pompous slogan goes, "Nobody bakes a cake as tasty as a Tastykake."  Once you experience the Butterscotch Krimpet, you'll realize that they have more than substantial reason to gloat.

review/summary: An Insult to The Consumer
review/text: For starters, I'm not an anti-Splenda fanatic. I've been a user for years, and despite internet sites claiming that Splenda is the equivalent of radioactive waste, my hair is still thick, my brain still works, and my doctor says all my organs are just fine.  That said, Splenda with fiber is one of the silliest insults to consumer intelligence out there.<br /><br />The envelope that Splenda with fiber comes in is much more rigid than the standard issue packet, and appears to be foil reinforced.  It is so stiff that you can't do the customary snap of the wrist to move the powder to the bottom, so that when you tear open the packet you don't make a mess.  No luck with this packet, which might stop a bullet if placed in your vest pocket.<br /><br />Next, the powder sinks to the bottom of your favorite beverage (mine being coffee)....and STAYS there.  It does not dissolve instantly, in fact it puddles at the bottom of your cup.  If you happen to zap your coffee in the microwave, it carmelizes:  a thick, slightly brown, hard to scrub out goo becomes adherent to the cup bottom.<br /><br />A gram of fiber in every packet?  Come ON, Splenda people!  A bit of corn (corn is the source of fiber in this product)in your morning beverage is NOT where you want to go nutritionally! If you get your fiber from whole grains, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, you also get the added benefit of vitamins and anti-oxidants.  If you get it from your artificial sweetener, you get...a brown gooey mess at the bottom of your cup.<br /><br />AND, Splenda with fiber costs more than regular Splenda.  I'm a family physician, and what the Splenda people appear to have done conforms to a very familiar pattern in the pharmaceutical world:  as the patent expires on the original medication, modify the product slightly, get a new patent, and keep charging the higher (non-generic) price.  Sucralose is now generic/off-patent, and available in multiple brands cheaper than Splenda.<br /><br />Argh.  Eat healthy foods.  Exercise.  Forget paying significantly more for 1 gram of fiber in your Splenda.  This product is dually hampered:  it under-performs, and it is an idea that makes little to no nutritional sense.

review/summary: 3.5 stars for a good idea that costs too much
review/text: I love Splenda and have been using it since it first debuted on the market.  Unlike other artificial sweeteners, it has no aspartame (which I am allergic too).  It also dissolves easily in hot and cold drinks.  For the last 6 months, I've been counting calories to lose weight and control my portions better.  When I saw the new enriched Splenda, I decided to give it a try because I had a coupon.  I drink a lot of hot tea to help curb my snack cravings, and I thought the added fiber might make a cup feel more filling.  While I'm not sure if it is more filling, I have noticed that the Splenda with fiber is sweeter to me.  I used to use 2 packets of Splenda in my tea, but only need one of these.  I'm not sure if this is because each packet has more in it, or if the fiber enhances the sweetness. Otherwise, it tastes the same as regular Splenda.<br /><br />However, this product also has some disadvantages that will keep me from buying it regularly.  First, as another reviewer noted, the packets are not simple paper.  They are foil-lined to keep the fiber from hardening the Splenda.  While I understand the necessity, it is inconvenient.  I often spill a little trying to open them because I can't shake the granules to the bottom first.  Second, it does not dissolve as easily, especially in cold liquids.  It will dissolve, you just need to add it more slowly and stir a lot.  Finally, and most critically, Splenda essentials are a LOT more expensive.  A 400 count box of regular Splenda is $11 on Amazon Subscribe & Save as of this writing.  In contrast, the Splenda Essentials with B vitamin or Antioxidants (the fiber is not yet available) are almost $15 for 320 packets.  I found a similar price differential in my local grocery store and at Wal Mart.<br /><br />Overall, if these were the same price as regular Splenda, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them. As it is, I won't buy them again unless I have a coupon that makes it worth while. It's a good idea; especially to add vitamins to your diet in something you already use regularly.  But, it's not worth the price hike.

review/text: I prefer stevia and agave, because they're natural products -- both very low or zero on the Glycemic Index.  But for those who use artificial sweeteners, too (which I do), it doesn't get any better than this.  Yes, it *will* clump up if you don't stir it in . . . but that's just a microscopic problem.  It's not like some protein powders, which need a blender to mix in!  :-)  So, just move the coffee (or whatever) just a bit as you pour it in: problem solved completely.  As for the taste, it's indistinguishable from regular Splenda.  There you have it.  :-)

review/summary: Made in Michigan since 1866
review/text: I like "Vernor's", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime.  The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment.

review/summary: Great cookies but check the expiry date!
review/text: Bought the 3oz double chocolate chip cookies and liked them so much that also subscribed to these raisin oatmeal mini cookies. (the 3oz one was a big too big for me) 48 cookies arrived and as I checked the expiry date (or best before date) I realized I only had about 2 weeks to finish the 48 cookies. Great cookies and great deal if freshness can be guaranteed!

review/text: I bought the mini-breakfast cookies in oatmeal rasin for my Dad, who is 89 and tends to forget to eat if we don't nag him. He greatly enjoys these cookies and makes breakfast by spreading them with a little natural peanut butter and accompanying them with milk or juice. I have also ordered other varieties of these breakfast cookies and they make a fast, filling breakfast just nutritious enough to get you over any guilt you might feel about eating a cookie for breakfast. I have also used the oatmeal cookies as a base crust for vanilla pudding pie--a great quickie dessert.

review/summary: Very good for a convenience food!
review/text: These are great little cookies that are the perfect size to give my toddler for a treat.  They are individually wrapped cookies, 2" round x .5" thick, and are great to throw into the diaper bag; if my mom and I go out for coffee and have a pastry with our java, I happily hand my daughter one of these so she feels included as we have a special afternoon snack.<br /><br />I love the ingredients list and only 7 grams of sugar for a cookie is good.  Most cookies of this size and weight are 12 grams of sugar and spooky ingredients.<br /><br />I keep mine in the freezer and take them out as I need.  The texture is actually better after thawing, a bit moister than before.  I also get the full size breakfast cookies for myself for when I have no time to make breakfast, I keep them in the freezer too and spritz twice with water, heat for 30 seconds in the microwave and enjoy; they taste fresh out of an oven when this is done.<br /><br />On sub & save this is a very good deal vs. what you'd pay in the store.<br /><br />I highly recommend Erin Baker products.

At ~100 calories they give you a little boost like a gel would but are so much more pleasant to eat than GU!  Biking particularly, they are the perfect little morsel to pop in your mouth and yet not lose track of your bike group.  This is my favorite flavor hands down.

review/summary: Greatest Decaf Tea Ever
review/text: I first started drinking Tazo Lotus tea when it was available at Starbucks. A while back, it started disappearing from Starbucks and then from all of my local grocery stores. I was so happy when I found it on Amazon, and for a decent price. The six-pack can be a little overwhelming, but if you love this tea, it probably won't be a problem. This is the second six-pack I've purchased from Amazon.<br /><br />The tea itself is surprisingly delicious. If you brew it correctly (no oversteeping), it has very little of the bitterness that sometimes turns me off to green tea. The aroma is one of the best I've ever smelled in a tea, like delicate flowers mixed with melon. The flavor is also delicate (light green tea and melon) and great with a little bit of honey or sugar. It even stands up to a touch of milk and can serve as a light dessert tea due to the melon characteristics. The fact that it's decaf makes it a good replacement for herbal tea for me. I have a friend who can't tolerate caffeine but loved green tea back when she could drink it, so I share this decaf with her. We both love it, and we  hope it never gets discontinued!

review/text: Lotus green tea is simply amazing.  We first had it at McCormick and Schmick's in Philadelphia and fell in love with it.  It's a green tea with the mellow hint of Lotus blossoms that give it an amazing taste that relaxes you and awakes your senses.  We normally put a little agave syrup in to sweeten it, but we really don't need it.

review/summary: Unusual, delicate and sensual!
review/text: This tea scores high on all counts--fragrance, flavor and even the name! Making tea with Lotus creates a delicate light green brew which is deliciously scented. The flavor is augmented by the aroma--a light floral flavor with just a hint of the grassines of green tea. The unusual taste of lotus flower is hard to describe--it has a slight buttery flavor reminiscent of fine jasmine tea.<br /><br />If you need a strong jolt of flavor this tea is not for you. If you want something unusual, savor the subtlety of this wonderful tea.<br /><br />Quote from The Book of Tea by Okakura:<br /><br />"Meanwhile, let us have a sip of tea.  The afternoon glow is brightening the bamboos, the fountains are bubbling with delight, the soughing of pines is heard in our kettle.  Let us dream of evanescence, and linger in the beautiful foolishness of things."

review/text: My mother in law called and told me that she was having a real hard time finding this particular tea where my in-laws moved to.  I went to my local grocery stores and Starbucks, but was unable to find just the box of Lotus Green tea.  Sometimes you can find it in the variety pack, but then you end up buying several packs of tea only for the 4 teas you want.  I went online and found that Amazon had the best price for the tea in a giant pack of 6!  So I ordered it and had it shipped directly to my mother-in-law.  She was thrilled to receive it so quickly.  She really enjoys the light taste and that it is decaf.

I usually add one packet of sugar in the raw and a squirt of agave nectar. I can drink this everyday of the week and never get bored. I have no purchased this from amazon but when i move to my new house i am going too. six boxes is a lot but if you drink tea regularly it will go pretty fast. This is a great tea, if you are looking for something new to try give this a shot.

review/summary: Flowery Decaffeinated Green Tea Experience
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Lotus Decaffeinated Green Tea is one of my favorite Tazo teas. The lotus flower flavor is pleasant and delightful. This tea is not bitter or harsh in any way. It is one of the most natural-tasting of the Tazo's I've tasted, very subtle, and much less artificial-tasting.<br /><br />The ingredients in Lotus are: naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Of course, this tea is caffeine-free.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "delightfully subtle green tea with the inner radiance and essence of lotus flower." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Lotus as "peach, nutty, flowery, overripe melon. This surprisingly full-flavored yet delicately floral blend is clean and light-bodied, with an aroma reminiscent of freesia." Tazo also describes the aroma as "tropical fruit, green tea". Hmmm...I don't taste all of these various flavors, and I suspect that Tazo really pushes the creative writing limit. I taste green tea, and a nice flowery flavor, which I'm assuming is the lotus, but not the rest---the peach, nuts, melon, freesia, tropical fruit---they're missing from what I can discern here.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Lotus gets only four stars.<br />****

I opened teabag#2 and the string wasn't attached to it either, but since it didn't fall on the floor I went ahead and used it. The bag broke during brewing, so the leaves were all over the inside of the cup. I dumped that one out and tried again with teabag #3, and the results were identical to teabag #2, so I just said "Forget it!".  What are the odds of getting 3 defective bags in a row??? I now hate Tazo teabags.

Because I do bake when I have time, I'm pretty picky and I have make pumpkin bread, zucchini bread, muffins, and carrot cake. Marge's  breads were outstanding! They were moist and not overly sweet. The icing on the carrot cake was delicious. They arrived in a couple of days as promised in a cute little basket which I'm using elsewhere now. I did freeze them as soon as they arrived and they held up beautifully. Since my order, I went directly to their website to order just the carrot cake. I wish Amazon would allow the option of only ordering three of the same breads. Thank you Marge's Bakery for making an outstanding product...thank you Amazon for finally carrying some vegan products--please continue to find these small businesses throughout our country!

review/summary: square shapes and round shapes, food value  and good color for salads
review/text: Will be ordering several more cases of these great carrots and peas for winter and emergency; the price per can delivered by Amazon is less than the cost per can at the nearest supermarket, several miles away.  Besides, not every store in the area carries Libby's, but more expensive brands.<br />  This 15-ounce can offers about 3 1/2 servings, which each have 60 calories, no fat or cholesterol, 10 grams carb, 3 grams protein, 330 milligrams sodium, and about 160 milligrams potassium.  Also some vitamin A.  Probably there is  much more sodium in french fries...<br />It might be worth checking to see if potassium in salt substitute can be added, just a pinch, to offset what sodium there is, if it's a concern for you.<br />Ingredients on label are:  peas, water, carrots, sugar and salt.<br />  1.  Sugar _is a definite plus,  not high fructose corn syrup).<br />  2.  Carrots are a beautiful orange color and taste sweet and good; the carrots are packed on top and peas are on the bottom. Clever, on- purpose  separation has been good like this in several cans, now; you could spoon out the carrots for one recipe and use the peas for your tuna fish salad.<br />  3. Carrots aren't the usual round coin-like slices, but are small and square.  Might interest children?  square and round...<br />  4. We had these peas and carrots with pasta in salad for lunch today<br />and had sunflower-seed butter as salad dressing.  Would do it again.<br />  5.  If you cook for your pets, and this  product is new,  this might make a nice addition to what you give them.  My dog loves these and sometimes takes her dish with peas and carrots off to eat in privacy.<br /> This product is Recommended for everybody.  Enjoy.  And thanks to the manufacturer , Seneca Foods, for the thoughtfulness involved...

review/text: I was very glad to find this on Amazon as I had been looking for it for quite some time with no success.  I never thought to look here.<br />Bobbie Flay uses this frequently and I wanted to try it.  Well, now I have it and am very pleased with the results, it adds another depth of flavor.  As others have said, be careful not to use too much as it is very powerful and will thicken quite alot.

review/summary: Smells great but a bit sour
review/text: Pros<br />-Mixed with a little water its thick and smells great, just like pizza sauce.<br />-The container is filled right up to the top, you really get your money's worth.<br /><br />Cons<br />-Its a bit sour when tasted all by itself. I'm think when its cooked up and blended with other ingredients it will be fine.<br />-The package does not come with a safety seal/tamper resistant wrapper. These days even my moisturizer comes with a tamper resistant seal and all food should be sealed that way as well.

review/summary: CSC Tomato Powder - adds depth and slightly thickens
review/text: This Tomato Powder is a must for many sauces, soups, stews, and an outright requirement for chili.  It adds a depth and richness to anything it is used in and has a nice thickening quality as well.  The quality of CSC spices is amazing, the value is excellent, and it keeps well. When I purchased my first 32 ounce container from CSC I thought to myself that I would die with it 1/2 full, but no way - I find all kinds of unexpected ways to use it.  I ordered a second container of a different variety and opened it before first was completely empty and compared the aroma of my four year old container and there was no difference. It was kept in a cool, dark pantry in it's original container and it did not lose any of its flavor. I have tried and highly recommend Colorado Spice Company's Ancho Chili Pepper, Smoked Paprika, and the Tomato Powder. I'm sure they are all amazing, but those are the only products I have tried thus far.

review/text: I live in a warm climate but have some major air conditioning at work so can sometimes fake the seasons. I was hoping to get a nice herbal tea to help warm me up that tasted and smelled great.<br /><br />This tea only has its smell to recommend it. It smells fantastic, and actually, the tin is pretty neat as well, but when I soaked it for a while it just tasted bland and watered down. I tried adding another bag to see if I had gotten the water amount wrong, but the second bag didn't add any flavor either.<br /><br />If you are looking for some AMAZING hot apple cider, I DO recommend Green Mountains Hot Apple Cider in K-cups for the Keurig brewer. THESE are what fall, and crisp mornings, and old fashioned donuts are all about!

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 3:16 Mins<br /><br /></span>The soda has a nice caramel dark soda color. As I pour the root beer, there is mild carbonation, and all the bubbles froth up to the top so there is the characteristic root beer float froth. It has a light root beer smell with undertones of butterscotch. When I drink it, it has a very smooth and caramel-like taste that finishes with the butterscotch flavor. The butterscotch flavor reminds me of the Brach's Butterscotch Disk Candy that I used to have as a kid. The aftertaste is a warm butterscotch flavor that is very good.

review/summary: Who knew?
review/text: Who knew these two flavors would blend together so well. Root beer flavor with just a little bite and with a full bodied butterscotch background and aftertaste is the best root beer I've had in years. It doesn't have really strong wintergreen or cinnamon or ginger like some of the other boutique root beers. I don't like those strong flavors in my root beer. This isn't like those root beers.<br />Barqs, before it was bought by coke, when it was a small root beer company in Louisiana, used to be my favorite. This is better. If you like root beer and butterscotch, get it. It's addictive. If Amazon had it as a subscribe and save item, I'd get a delivery every month.

review/summary: Amazing Cherry Pie
review/text: Before I sing the praises for this wonderful product, I will tell you a few things about myself:  I do not eat anything processed or that is imitation or that has chemicals in it.  I do not even eat processed sugar or flour.  This is not necessarily for health reasons, but because I simply do not like processed foods.  Therefore, there are very few foods, other than fresh foods, that I will eat.  I am very picky about my foods!<br /><br />This picky eater is giving this cherry pie bar 5 stars.  There are no added sugars, chemicals, or anything else.  There are only three natural, healthy ingredients: dates, almonds, and unsweetened cherries.<br /><br />Taste:  I've often heard that anything that's good for you does not taste good.  These bars must be the exception.  They taste so good, I have to hide them from myself!<br /><br />Healthiness:  These bars are only made with natural ingredients.  No added anything.<br /><br />Energizing:  Because these bars have only natural ingredients and no added sugars or chemicals, they give you the energy you need and cure your hunger.<br /><br />Convenience:  Because they don't have to be cooked or measured or heated, and you don't need a spoon, these bars are good to take for a lunch, or when you are traveling, or just when you will be out and might need a healthy snack before you get home.<br /><br />I have become addicted to these wonderful bars.  They are truly amazing.<br /><br />Also, I must add, these bars are vegan and kosher.  I do know that it is hard to find vegan-friendly foods.  Healthy, convenient, tasty, and vegan.  How much more can you ask for?<br /><br />These bars come in different awesome and amazing flavors.  This particular bar is cherry pie.  It tastes just like a cherry pie. It is amazing how they can make them taste this way without any added sugar or anything else, but only with natural ingredients (and only a few of them at that).  If you like cherry pie, you will love this bar.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  And not just to health-conscious people.

review/text: I've tried a lot of Lara Bar flavors and this is one of my favorites.  (I also like the Lime flavor a lot.)  The cherry flavor is very strong and concentrated.  You can eat it with soy milk ice cream for a cobbler effect.  The bar is one dense taste experience.  I don't find it particularly filling, so it doesn't serve as a meal replacement for me, but you can't beat the convenience of the bar when you want a little, potent snack.

review/summary: The grape are great! Nice and sour.
review/text: The grape flavor is great. It's nice and sour, the Xylitol isn't too sweet and it's actually good for your dental health!<br /><br />I liked them so much, I ordered some of the Fruit Punch flavor, but those were a complete disappointment, as they had no real flavor and certainly were not at all sour.<br /><br />Only 4 star, rather than five, because the flavor is strongest on the outside. The sour fades fairly quickly, with the interior not having the same zing. Still nice as a sugar free candy that provides some of that sourness some of us sometimes crave.<br /><br />Each piece is small, so you'll probably want two or three at a time to maximize the flavor.

Not sure WHY they have that taste because xylitol always tastes exactly like sugar to me.<br /><br />Also, Xylitol doesn't have the same gas and bloating issues that most sugar alcohols have.  Why anyone on the planet still thinks that maltitol is a good idea for sugar-free candies is beyond me.  With the health aspects of xylitol, it is a no brainer.  Unfortunately, that isn't the case yet.  So these are great.

BTW, the quantity is HUGE, while the cost is very small, and the product lasts a long time. Am also grateful that they are sweetened with Xylitol, which does not have the usual off-taste of synthetic sweeteners normally used in "sugar-free" products.

review/text: Being a 4th generation vegetarian, I'm always looking for new things to try.<br /><br />As an opened minded WASP, I'm willing to embrace the best of all cultures.<br /><br />As a busy guy, I like the rip it open, nuke and eat methodology.<br /><br />I've tried many of the Kitchens of India products.  Everyone I tried was really good, but this is by far my favorite.  It is also a complete quick meal by itself; many of the others are a curry of some sort and goes best with the rice you supply.<br /><br />I like the shelf life, and no refrigeration of this series of products.<br /><br />The taste is rather complex, and goes through a series of changes while you savor each bite.  I'm not good with words; you'll need to try it to understand. The effect is very pleasent, though.<br /><br />It's about 518 calories per package.  I use it as a main meal ( again as a veggie I've been accused of only eating side dishes...)<br /><br />Finally, being basically cheap, Amazon's 1/2 off sale makes it a compelling deal.

review/summary: Salty Salty Salty
review/text: Way too salty for my tastes.  If you like salty foods then this is well salted for you already.  If you don't like salty foods, then sadly stay away from this one.<br /><br />Too bad.  I was really looking forward to a good side for my meals.<br /><br />Hail Flavius!

review/summary: False advertising, I think!
review/text: The picture on the box shows rice with chunks of potatoes, slices of carrots, and slices of pepper. The content has rice with tiny shreds of carrots and peppers - really tiny wisps of them - less than 1MM thick and perhaps less then 1CM long. No evidence of potato to be seen anywhere.<br /><br />Kind of disappointing really. And it's the first product I tried from their lineup - purchased at local Meijer chain store. I complained to the company using their website and am thinking they may try to appease me by sending me something (they asked for my mailing address).<br /><br />Flavor was OK, not at all like the Basmati rice pilaf I get at local restaurants, but it tastes good and the texture of the rice came out fine using "Method 3" (pouch in boiling water).<br /><br />But I certainly expected something else after looking at the box and reading the ingredients!

review/summary: Very salty
review/text: This is so salty (to my taste) that it was almost inedible. It becomes OK when mixed with a lot of yogurt, but I shouldn't have to do that.

review/summary: Ok but not my style
review/text: This product was very oily as the other reviewer said. It also had a strong roasted chipotle type flavor and the cloves are very strong as well. It was not my style of basmati.  If you love cloves and cinnamon and such than this will be a good product for you to try, but if you aren't into cloves then you should probably pass. I also didn't think the cloves flavor married with the roasted flavor.  It wasn't like the roasted flavor in the eggplant dishes I've had.

review/summary: Taste not what I expected
review/text: Having tried Vegetable Hyderabadi Biryani in Hyderabad few times, I expected the same taste to atleast some extent.  But this smells very strong in Indian spices (the whole house, including  basement smelled for next 6 hours when microwaved) and when I tasted it, I got the feeling of a non-vegetarian dish. I had to add lots of raitha (side dish made of yogurt, onions, tomatoes, cilantro and diced serrano peppers) to overcome the strong taste. I have tried 3 other items from Kitchens of India and very satisfied and that's why I wanted to try this one. It is not that bad a choice if you have strong preference for that non-veg masala taste.

review/summary: Worst hyderabad biryani ever
review/text: I was very much exited when I found this on Amazon. Away from my hometown Hyderabad one thing I missed the most is Genuine Hyderabadi biryani. I thought this would make up for it. But, when cut opened the pouch to heat the biryani I found a strange smell coming out of it. I heated the biryani in microwave for 2 minutes and tasted it. And let me tell you it was the worst hyderabad biryani I have ever tasted. I was so pissed off that I threw in in a trash can. The taste and smell of the biryani were so bad that you cant even eat 2 spoons. So, guys if you are looking for genuine hyderabad biryani stay away from this. Actually I would have given it a zero star if it had been there.

review/summary: Caution: Same old ready-to-eat stuff
review/text: If u have tried ready-to-eat (any brand) from Indian grocer and u like that sort of thing then go for this else "DON'T".<br /><br />This is same old stuff (I bought it since it has ITC brand name expecting something better/different) and nothing great about it. Personally Ended throwing many of it in trash. (preservatives, no original taste) yucky!<br /><br />Spicy, but strange smell/taste.

review/summary: My cats love this moist  food with gravy
review/text: I can't argue with my kitties. They would eat only this type of food if I would let them. Kibbles are a must, but they share one can twice daily. They look forward to this early AM and late evening treat.<br />They are not partial to any flavor but texture and gravy count. They let me kow by how much they leave in their bowls.  For the "Grilled" food there are no leftovers, but "Classic" is not as good.<br /><br />I am just the messenger for "Grateful Pampered"  kitties.

review/summary: My Cats' Favorite Food!
review/text: When this food came out, my cats went crazy the first time I brought it home.  My older cats had liked the ground or classic cat food but these cats wouldn't have anything to do with it.  I've been buying this food for over a year and novelty hasn't worn off yet and even the cat across the street comes over for some.  They love it!

review/summary: Best deal in a long time from Fancy Feast
review/text: My two kitters love Fancy Feast cat food and because most of its varieties can be had on Prime, that is about all they get to eat. When they were lowly kittens who had just arrived from a rescue facility, Any Kind of food was Good Food. They were just thankful to eat. Kibble would have been OK with them forever had they known no better. But one kitty is a male and I know males tend to have problems with their urinary tracts especially if they do not get enough fluids, so I made the fateful decision to include "wet food" in their diets for the sake of the male. Fancy Feast was one of the few vendors who makes kitten food and so that is what they got and how this tale got started. One variety of food led to another variety of food and the next thing a doting mother could do was get downright fancy meals for her kids. All were available on Subscribe and Save and so came in at a reasonable cost. So, as things went along, mom fell for the more and more expensive types of Fancy Feast and the kitties went right along with her. But then, lo, something was amiss. Sometimes there was not satisfied smacking going on. Instead there was silence. No kitty mom likes silence. Silence indicates "the stare." And the kitty stare is quite similar to the "human stare."  No matter what the subject, the stare Always boils down to something very simple but very deadly: "WHAT WERE YOU THINKING WHEN....?"...When you bought the Ferrai?; When you got married THAT guy?; When you bought shares in "American BuggyWhip?; when you ....when you went overseas without me? The stare always indicates something of untold gravity as is indicated by the previous questions. So I get The Stare for: What were you thinking when you bought this cat food FOR ME? Great Gravity involved don't you see. The poor little kitty who had nothing to eat, now wants to know why he is getting some variety of Fancy Feast that does not quite suit his palatte. Me? I ask. Why darlings it is the same thing you always had. Eat for mommy. Nope. Silence with the Stare. So, like most other cat mommies, from time to time, I throw up my hands and figure, male urinary problems or not, kibble is what you get. But then, Fancy Feast came out with this grilled seafood pak. Best deal in a long time from Fancy Feast. I don't know why, but my kitters love it. It is nice meaty morsels of tuna, salmon and seafood.<br />Generally they do not care for these varieties, but love them in the Grilled Group. Maybe it is just the novelty. I spread it out and they do not get it very often. One case every 3-6 months on Subscribe and Save which makes the cost very low. I even send a case to my favorite charity once every six months. Those kitties love it too. The ferals who live out back get the leftovers and they scarf it down. So all kinds of kitties are thrilled with this particular variety of Fancy Feast. So, if you wish to hear the happy sounds of smacking and not get The Stare, then, right away, sign up. You and yours' should all be happy. Hope so. But then, you know kitties.....
