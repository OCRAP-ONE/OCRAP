review/summary: Great instant oatmeal!
review/text: This is the 1st time I've tried Bob's Red Mill instant oatmeal and I love it! Amazon has the best price on it (with Subscribe and Save), it arrived quickly and I really enjoy it! I am a big fan of a lot of Bob's Red Mill products. They are getting to be a little pricey at the local grocery stores so thankfully Amazon carries them. I will buy again once I run out of this oatmeal.<br />Keep in mind it is a health food so it definitely does not taste anything like cheesecake:) To make it less "healthy" add some jam or fruit and enjoy.

review/text: Very tacky to leave loose k-cups - i know that they are sealed but you realize people will drink from these - i just hope its sanitary - i washed them anyway - but still its disgusting....won't be ordering from this person again. Looks like since this is a trend with these types of products maybe i should just order from manufactor - afterall its only a couple of dollars to assure getting factory sealed packages.......<br /><br />Be ready to wash your product when it arrives.

review/summary: Usefulness of natural bones.
review/text: As a retired breeder of Basset Hounds, I was supprised to see these "chew toys".  A lot is being said about brushing your dogs teeth, and here is a fairly pleasant solution. I have seven hounds living in and out with my wife, and myself. Hounds, od course, will pick up "almost anything " to chew on.  In the past, to keep our children presentable, we spent a good deal of money on dental descaling.  Some history... Dogs as a general rule use the front "Canines" to catch, rip and tear prey animals.  Once they have dinner, they chew with the premolars- the middle teeth, and only use the back molars for cracking marrow bones, and other long bones.  I haven't found a single marrow bone in any bag of dogfood.  The result is no molar chewing, and rapid plaque build up.  Now, dogs teeth do not decay like ours do.  The buildup is rather benign, unless it starts encroaching under the gums. Then, you have an infection.  Antibiotics will clear that problem, but what next?  Eventually, you have your dog aenesthatized for descaling, or extraction.  Basset molars are big and tough, and will not pull unless the root has rotted, and as they age,all dogs are more suseptable to trouble in "LA-LA" land.  I have never killed a coyote with plaque.  They eat bones.  Unfortunately, our bones tend to be cooked, and splinter, and can cause a perforated bowel.  Merrick has the answer.  They take the beef knuckle, clean but don't cook it, and our hounds chew them to their hearts content,even working the molars and all other teeth.  The result has been non-splintering marrow bones with the "goodies" stripped, so the bones are not greasy on rugs, and furniture. Yes, all seven live with us with a dog door to go out to their fenced yard.  The only issue we have found is Cleetis, our big, oldest male sneaks the favorites out at night and burys them, causing the younger kids no end of searching, and sniffing-outside. Not really negative.  For a while, I carved numgers in them for "inventory control", and had one come in that had been pre-numbers, and was brought in just before our first major snowstorm..  Okay, maybe I have too much free time, but these Merrick bones are the best.  I avoid all smoked, or flavored styles, and I cannot tell if they have a "new" smell, or not, but we have happy, healthy hounds, without semiannual dental descaling, of bad teeth.  Dare I even say they don't have bad breath?  Anyway, this is a shining recommendation of Merricks "General Panton" 7-9inch beef knuckle.  Oh yeah, no stuffed ones either.  Sign me "Bassets of the Tundra" retired.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: I have a 6 month old Pom that chews on EVERYTHING. My idea was to get him a focal bone to attack. I read the one review about this product prior to purchasing, and I thought this would be perfect.<br /><br />Well..I should've read more closely and I would have noticed that the recommendation is for large dogs. This bone is sooooooooo heavy. My pup can not carry it in his mouth. Instead, he chews it on the couch and I have to transport it for him.<br /><br />I gave three stars only because he does actually chew it once he remembers that it is there. Needlesstosay, I am not sure how effective it is being that he's so small and the bone is extremely heavy. This is definitely a product for a large breed.

review/summary: Great for company-Best Scones around!
review/text: This product only uses 1 cup of whipping cream and is the moistest scone you will ever taste.  The website offers great recipes too.  I've tried all brands of package mixes and every type of homemade recipe, most are dry and have to be made at the last minute.  These take 1 minute to mix in whipping cream and they are ready go into the oven.  The secret is cooking them so they are still moist and you will find that they are the best anywhere.  We always serve them for guests and they think you've gone to a lot of work for this special treat!  Apricot is my family's favorite flavor out of all of the many choices.

review/summary: I expected more playfulness from a box of monkeys...
review/text: Monkey Bars are, according to the packaging, crazy healthy.  That may be the case.  They are intended to help your digestive system and are loaded with natural fibers to help regulate your system.  The ingredient list is predominantly natural ingredients and the fat and calorie content are a very nice `low' number for a breakfast food containing chocolate, peanut butter and bananas (three high calorie snacks).  That being said, these breakfast snacks usually boil down to flavor, and I'm not entirely impressed here.  Peanut butter is such an aggressive flavor and that really shows here.  The chocolate and the banana are basically non-existent and are replaced by a fibrous peanut butter, a chewy and somewhat off-putting texture that is too familiar (this tastes very similar to other breakfast bars) and leaves me wanting more.  I was excited.  Maybe it was the funny name and the cute packaging.  I just expected something new and fresh and what I got was the same ol' same with bigger claims.  If these are as healthy as they claim (the packaging also makes note that none of these claims have been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration) then great, but if you are looking for a tasty alternative to the bland `health bars' flooding shelves then look elsewhere.

review/text: I used these pearls on elephant cookies for a client.  They bled horribly, making each elephant look like it had a black eye.  So I ended up having to explain the issue to the client, which made me look completely inept and unprofessional... and I stayed up most of the night rebaking and redecorating them and delivered the cookies just before the event started.  I emailed Wilton customer service and they said that it's common for colored pearls/sprinkles to bleed because of the moisture in the icing.  Basically, "tough luck."  Other brands don't bleed, so Wilton is full of crap.  They have lost me as a customer... I will never buy as much as a bakery box from them again.

They last long and don't constantly break off into large pieces.

These are made in China if you're concerned about that, but I haven't been able to find a pressed rawhide that's made in the USA.  At the time, I bought these for $45 and I thought it was a good price.

review/text: Monster Labradane can demolish a regular rawhide bone in a matter of an hour or so. Those huge 24" knotted rawhide bones as big as your forearm? They don't even last two days with him. This took three days of SOLID chewing. Since he has to be chewing on something... this is a good value for him and he seemed to really like it. I like that it did not end up in miltiple pieces like the knotted rawhide bones AND since he had to work harder on it, he ingested much smaller pieces of rawhide and a lot less overall volume.

review/summary: Gumbo File is Good Eats!
review/text: I first heard of Gumbo File on Alton Brown's marvelous cooking show <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018KVL5O">Good Eats</a>.  He recommended it as a substitute for okra as a thickening agent for gumbo, giving an added authentic flavor as well as thickening the soup.  I have learned to trust Alton Brown's cooking advice, so I was looking forward to giving it a try.<br /><br />Gumbo File is made from dried and powdered sassafras leaves.  Even though I live in a major city, it wasn't something that I could find at my local grocery store.  Since this was my first time trying it, and you only use about a table spoon of file to a 2-quart soup, I didn't want to buy a lot of it.  This 1 oz. package was just the right size.<br /><br />I have to say, the Gumbo File worked exactly as advertised!  I made a pot of shrimp and andouille gumbo, using a shrimp stalk, and the end result was far too watery.  A tablespoon of file applied and a few minutes later the soup had a nice body and a distinct delicious grassy flavor that hadn't existed in previous gumbos I have made.<br /><br />I also set out some of the file powder on the table for people to add to the gumbo for flavor and extra thickening.  The dish got good reviews all around, and was some of the best gumbo I have eaten.  I am definitely a file fan.

The sulphuric salt definitely carries that egglike scent and flavor as the other reviews have pointed out. It definitely sounded interesting, which is why i bought this, and at around $7, i am pretty much always willing to take a chance on something unproven. I have tried it by itself, an some veggies, and mixed into almond milk quesadillas, and i cant say i hated it, but as i said before, i cant really decide if i liked it either. I think this one is very much a question of personal taste. I am vegan, and dont really miss eggs, so maybe that is part of it. Dont know. I do know that it is interesting, and i certainly wouldn't dissuade anybody from trying it. You might find it to be a five star product like the previous two reviewers did...and they arent wrong. As i say, this one in particular is a subjective thing. I dont know that there is a wrong rating for this salt. Some will love it, some will hate it, and some will be undecided like i am.

review/summary: Product Information Not Clear
review/text: I bought this product and paid extra for it (compared to another seller on Amazon) because it is labelled as "Organic" but there is nothing on the jar to tell that it is indeed organic. The seller explained to me that this product is considered Organic in Europe but not in the US since the FDA does not recognize any mineral as organic. I only wish that the seller would provide this information so that people can make informed decision.<br /><br />The product otherwise tastes good and is good for digestion and great in different recipes.

review/summary: pecan pie
review/text: Honestly, if you want an excellent pecan pie,find a decent recipe, make your own dough, put fresh ingredients in it, and make it yourself.  Otherwise, the dough is going to taste stale and the filling, mediocre.  I have found no exceptions to this rule except a company called The Grand Traverse City Pie Company out of Michigan, that makes pies as good as homemade (and no, I am not in any way connected with them).  And they do not sell online or by mail.

review/summary: Fusion Smoothies
review/text: The V8 Fusion Smoothie is the best product I've seen mass produced ever. Seriously. This juice is delicious, made from real fruits and vegetables, and above all healthy for you. It contains reasonable amounts of fiber (especially for a drink) and it comes ready made for you at the store. When I saw that this existed, I immediately bought some to try it out. You should too, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how long I wished something like this existed, since I don't have room for a juicer, nor time to use one. If you are a busy student or professional, I highly recommend this juice as a replacement for soda in your diet. Delicious and healthy. Who'd have thought?

review/summary: Ranch Style trying to pull a fast one
review/text: I've been eating Ranch Style Beans all my life and love them.  They were made in Fort Worth, Texas for nearly a hundred years.  This year, they were bought by ConAgra, the plant was closed and production was moved to Ohio.  That's not all that was changed.  The cans used to be brimming with beans with just enough sauce.  Now fully a third of each can is sauce...they're selling us WATER.  They taste the same and for that I'm grateful, but the can says "Beans" and I expect beans...not water.  Some slick suit has decided to maximize profit by compromising the brand.  Won't work here and I've bought my last can until I can shake the can and it sounds like it has more beans than water.  And why would anyone pay almost $50 for a case?  I can buy them at Sam's Wholesale Club for $12.00 a case.

review/summary: Ranch Style Beans - Like No Other
review/text: I have search high and low for a bean that compares to the Ranch Style brand, unfortunately there isn't one. Chili beans leave a lot to be desired with their over reliance on chili powder rather than true flavor that Ranch Style has to offer. Ranch Style beans are truly unique, they are a wonderful addition to goulash, eaten alone or topped with some cheese. They have a unique, smooth flavor that doesn't rely on any one ingredient but a blend that tasty.

review/summary: Whole case of dented cans
review/text: When I got the case of Ranch Style beans, almost every can was dented.  Not from this shipping either.  The cans were packed correctly, including foam peanuts!  Cans dented on the edges, cans dented in the middle of the case, cans dented on the bottom, cans dented on the top.  No particular pattern such as being dropped on the side of the case or crushed from above, just a whole bunch of dented cans (none leaking).  I e-mailed the company (asian foods company) sending them pictures and for my money and effort, I was told that if the cans weren't leaking, they would not reship the order and assured me they were not shipped dented.  Sorry, it doesn't take a CSI investigator to determine that they bought damaged caseloads and that's what you get.  Also, at the price they want for them (I had to have them for a special event and no other source was available to get them here on time to Alaska), they know they were only selling off a broken case lot and would not have to worry about "Amazon's Reviews."  Of all my dealings through Amazon, this is by far the worst company I've ever dealt with.

review/summary: It took almost 20 minutes to open the can!
review/text: Why should it be so difficult to open a can.  I use a can opener which does not cut the lid, it "derims" the lid from the can, thus leaving no sharp cutting edges.<br /><br />I tried to open both ends of the can and couldn't pull the lid free.  I had to use two different kinds of pliers to finally pull the lid off the can, which happened to be the bottom end of the can.  There was almost an inch of goop in the bottom before getting to the beans.  Needless to say, being that the beans are in liquid, it didn't leave much beans left for my recipe.  (I used the beans to make a bean salad.)  I expected the beans to be black but they are not.<br /><br />I doubt seriously that I will buy that brand of "black" beans again.

review/summary: Very disappointed
review/text: I ordered 5 bags as my dog loves these dingos. All 5 bags were stale. The reason I say this is because of the crystallization of the meat in almost every dingo. It was obvious just looking at the contents through the bag that they were stale/old. I gave my dog one and he ate the part that wasn't crystalized but nothing more. Very disappointed that those 5 packages were even sent to anyone.

review/text: Our dog loves these things. We've been buying them at our local grocery store for years. When I saw them in bulk here, I jumped at the chance to save some money. Unfortunately, the "chicken" is not the same as contained in the store-bought four-packs. Our little buddy tried one, left it, and never finished another. Note, the chicken is a darker red color in these than the store-bought packs. I felt misled since the description matched what we previously purchased in the store.

review/summary: Dogs love Dingo
review/text: My very picky GSD loves these treats, but they are pricey for dog treats and they aren't always available in stores, so I watch for deals on Amazon.  They combine a meaty treat inside, with thin rawhide that gives some chewing time, although they don't last too long.  Dingo also makes larger balls - they last a bit longer than these, but these are treats anyway, I find the smaller balls are better value.  I did make the mistake of leaving them out once when I was away.  She of course ate the entire bag, which did not agree with her digestive system.  But as treats they are great.

review/summary: Great price and a very good black cherry juice concentrate
review/text: It's just black cherry juice but if you want to avoid the gout a bit of black cherry juice everyday might help keep those crippling attacks at bay.<br /><br />I haven't had an attack in two years since I started drinking a six ounce glass of black cherry juice every day. Sure it's just antidotal and one's person experience but black cherry juice defiantly works for me. It sure beats having another gout attack and having to use any of those nasty gout medications which can play havoc with your GI track.<br /><br />I bought this brand primarily on price, which is a very good deal compared to the other brands. The twelve pack weighs 15 pounds so getting free shipping is very nice. I found this brand to be a little sweeter than some other brands so I don't find myself needing to use a sweetener such as Splenda when I mix it with water.<br /><br />To make an even taster drink try it mixed with club soda.  Its also great added to a fruit smoothe.

I use a bottle every 6 days. I dilute about 2 Oz in a 6 ounce glass of water each day. The reduction in aches is worth the money. Also, paying extra for organic black cherries is worth it to me. A lot of pesticides are used on regular black cherries. I also eat healthy and exercise. I am 72 years old. Just trying to make the best of what I have left. If you can afford wine, beer, soft drinks, etc., why not buy something that also makes you feel better.

review/summary: Some Education About Vegan Cats
review/text: Unfortunately most people are ill informed about vegan cats, including most veterinarians.<br /><br />Wild cats are in fact obligate carnivores. However, in domesticating the house cat and bringing it into our homes we have effectively removed the cat from its natural prey of mice, insects, birds, lizards, and other small creatures. During the past 100 years or so, as the human food industry was searching for a way to salvage and use all the waste materials from its processing lines, it came upon a wonderful solution. Lets boil it all up and dry it out and add it to the food we make for cats and dogs. As a result, the vast majority of commercial pet foods contain what are euphemistically referred to as the four D's, dead, dying, disabled, and diseased animals, along with other quite undesirable materials. Quite frankly, if you are feeding this junk to your pets, you are effectively poisoning them. We are seeing diseases in pets today that we have never seen before because of the wide variety of contaminated ingredients that are finding their way into the food we feed our companion animals. You know "garbage in, garbage out!"<br /><br />Now the issue here is not meat; it is about providing all the essential and non-essential amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and vitamins and minerals that are bio-available to the particularly unique physiology of felids (cats). The quality, quantity, and availability of these nutrients can come from any source, and for those of us who are vegan, the best source is vegetable based.<br /><br />Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of cats around the world live quite well on one of the several available vegan cat foods that are recognized as nutritionally complete. I personally have had 3 1/2 years of experience in feeding the Evolution kibble product that this review is addressing. It is a high quality product that is AAFCO certified as nutritionally complete for all life stages in cats. Not only is this product safe to feed your cat, but if you follow the recommended feeding procedures, you will find many benefits to both your cat's health and your wallet.<br /><br />If you desire more detailed information, I invite you to do a google search on vegan cats. I would put my web page information about this issue on this review, but it is against the policy for writing reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Just for everyone's edification, I have researched this issue for well over 500 hours, read hundreds of technical papers, visited hundreds of web sites, and have made a commitment to specialize in feline nutrition as part of my Veterinary Technician studies. I probably know more about feline nutrition than 95% of all the vets in the world.<br /><br />My feline son is a vegan and will remain so because I am absolutely certain that his quality of life will be enhanced by his diet and that this choice will not be a detriment to his health.<br /><br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />Since writing this review in 2006 I have had a change in position about this particular product after 4 years of personal experience. The manufacturer of the Evolution foods was changing the formulation of the food on a regular basis and during that time I found that the Feline Kibble was not able to maintain the pH level in the urine of cats that was promised on the label and in their literature. At least that wasn't the case with my former feline son and my current feline son. As a result I can no longer recommend the use of Evolution Feline Kibble for male cats. Since urinary issues are different between male and female cats the Evolution Kibble MAY be satisfactory for feeding to female cats. Nutritionally the Evolution foods seem to be fine for nutrients but not necessarily adequate for maintaining the proper pH levels to avoid urinary issues for male cats.<br /><br />Consequently I am now recommending male cats use the Vegecat pH diet provided by Harbingers of a New Age. My son has been eating this food supplement in a specially prepared gluten formulation I created called a vegan feline roast. It is 62% protein, 33% fat, and 5% carbs and has a moisture content of about 60%. Almost a perfect combination of ingredients to mimic natural prey. My son finds this product to be very palatable and his urinary pH has been consistently at 6.4 for the three years that we have been producing and consuming this food. The drawback is that it takes about a half hour every 3 days to make the food and the cost is equivalent to a premium cat food. But on the other hand my son is trim, full of energy at 6 1/2 years, enjoys great health, no longer has urinary tract issues, and no other animal had to die in order to provide my son with life-giving nutrition.<br /><br />UPDATE:  4/17/11<br /><br />For those of you who are still considering feeding the Evolution kibble, please heed this warning.  Kibble is only 10% moisture content.  If you follow the directions given by the manufacturer to soak the kibble prior to feeding, you will end up with a mushy material that your cats may or may not like.  The danger in feeding the dry kibble is that your cat will eventually become so dehydrated that no amount of drinking will be sufficient to avoid hydration related illnesses.  Cats do not naturally drink water, they almost exclusively obtain all of their hydration from the food that they consume.  If they are eating something that only has 10% moisture, upon consumption the moisture that is contained within the digestive tract of the cat will be sucked into the food in order to give it enough fluidity to pass through the intestines.  This will often lead to gastro-intestinal diseases. Your cat will be constantly drinking water to make up for that deficiency, but no amount of drinking is enough to avoid the dehydration problem.  So please remember that the best source of moisture for your cat's health, comes from a wet food diet that is around 70% moisture.<br /><br />In October 2008 I wrote an article about vegan cats published in VegFamily magazine.  This information and more will help those who are interested in a vegan diet for cats understand more of the issues.<br /><br />UPDATE:  8/27/12<br /><br />My vegan feline son is now 8 years old and still maintains an extremely healthy life with absolutely no issues of any kind.  He has been using our Vegan Feline Roast product for the past 5 and 1/2 years and his lab tests indicate that his nutritional needs are being adequately met by his vegan diet.<br /><br />For those who are sceptical about a vegan diet for house cats, there is ample evidence that several vegan products are available to satisfy the nutritional needs of cats.  I am still not convinced that Evolution is a good product to feed based on my past history.  There are thousands of customers that seem to successfully feed the Evolution product; however, I believe that our Vegan Feline Roast Mix is a superior product that will yield far better results over the lifetime of feeding any house cat.  Our product is based on the Vegecat phi supplement offered by HOANA, which I have found to be an excellent product for hitting all of the missing nutritional elements that would otherwise come from meat.  The Vegecat product line has been successfully feeding thousands of cats over a 27 year period and we highly recommend the use of Vegecat for those people who wish to formulate their own vegan cat food.  The only difference between our food product and the HOANA vegecat product is that our product is a ready-to-make mix that has been specifically formulated for a high protein/high fat food that is easy to make and highly palatable to the vast majority of cats.<br /><br />I would caution people feeding the Evolution kibble to reconsider doing so.  The problem with kibble in general, not just the Evolution product, is the 10% moisture content of the food.  Cats that eat kibble exclusively will invariably become dehydrated and will not be able to consume enough water by drinking to avoid the condition.  Evolution kibble that is soaked with water prior to feeding, as recommended by the manufacturer, is an attempt to avoid this issue.  However, by soaking the product you will reduce the palatability quality to most cats and will make it harder for them to continue to want to eat the product.  This is a strategy to fix a problem that is inherent to the product itself.<br /><br />As time goes on, I become more convinced that using our Vegan Feline Roast product may in fact be a cure for diseases in cats like FLUTD and diabetes.  At some point in time I would like to perform a long term double blind scientifically significant study to support my empirical observations.  When my son started out 7 years ago eating Evolution kibble, he quickly developed a FLUTD condition, after 18 months of use, that cost $1500 at the vet to fix.  The last 5 1/2 years of eating nothing but our Vegan Feline Roast he has remained FLUTD free and maintains excellent health.  Just the savings alone from avoiding annual teeth cleaning has more than paid for itself in the use of our product.<br /><br />So my bottom line is to recommend not using Evolution Kibble in favor of either the HOANA vegecat supplement or our Vegan Feline Roast Mix.

review/summary: Kitties go crazy for veggie cat food!
review/text: The two little darlings at my home have been eating this particular cat food since we got them from the local shelter at the ripe young age of 6 months.  We chose to switch them over to vegetarian cat food for two reasons: 1) both of us are ethical vegetarians, and 2) we could!<br /><br />We switched them using the same methods vets have recommended when undergoing any change in diet for felines--slowly mixing them together in differing proportions until all that they eat is the new kind of food.  In this way the cats do not undergo any kind of indigestion that might cause them to throw up (those with cats already will understand completely).<br /><br />But what was the surest sign that we were doing the right thing for our cats?  Even on the first day, and for everyday it was given to them after, they ignored the meat-based cat food, eating only the vegetable-based pieces from their bowl!  Everyday when I went to feed them in the morning, they would be waiting next to a bowl with meat-food detritus, staring impatiently for the vegetable goodness.<br /><br />As for their level of health, I have literally never known two cats to be sweeter or more active than these.  And I don't mean chaotic, but playful, pouncy, and sweet.  Is it all because of the food?  I can't say to 100% certainty.  But know this: when we got the kittens they were shy and scared, seemingly because both only have vision in their left eyes.  Now they are more daring than even the most normal of cats.<br /><br />All this and we don't have to participate in the inhumane practice of feeding waste animals to our companion friends!

review/summary: Best in all ways
review/text: My cat has been eating this food since he was a month old, and is now a sleek, highly active and brilliantly healthy 6 month-old. I have never seen a shinier coat on a cat. He is active, interested, talkative and very playful.<br /><br />I checked carefully to ensure that my cat would be getting all the nutrients he requires from a vegan product, and Evolution's certifications were sound.<br /><br />I feed him on demand, with a handful of the food as required. I am quite happy handling the food knowing that there are no questionable animal products and other undesirable ingredients that could also sicken me. The food smells great and he loves it.<br /><br />I transitioned him from a standard dry kitten food, and he was initially reluctant. I had been feeding him the Evolution food after soaking it in a little water, but after I stopped wetting it, he immediately switched fully.<br /><br />Even if you yourself are not a vegetarian, this food makes sense on all levels. You are guaranteed of high quality ingredients without the horrific waste meat and other byproducts in standard pet foods, Evolution itself is healthy to handle and keep in the house and of course, cats thrive on it!

review/summary: My kitten has been eating this for six months
review/text: This food is economical; because you can (and should) moisten it with water, one 10-pound bag makes 30 pounds of cat food. It's nutritionally complete, fortified with both taurine and carnitine (amino acids which occur naturally in meat, but are usually processed out in the making of meat-based animal foods and have to be added back.)<br /><br />It is much "cleaner" than meat-based pet foods in which--regardless of what the customer is led to believe--a company can include all sorts of "meat by-products"--hair, beaks, feathers, and even ear tags. Considering that rates of heart disease and cancer among cats and dogs parallel those of their human companions, there must be a better way to feed them. Animals being fed Evolution are regularly living over 20 years now, and with far fewer geriatric problems such as arthritis and heart disease than their carnivore counterparts.<br /><br />Best of all, cats like it; my young cat has been eating it for several months now and is thriving, with a glossy coat. For variety, I also give him Evolution canned food, which he loves.

review/summary: made my cat sick
review/text: As a vegan, I try to avoid harming and consuming animals to the fullest extent. For this reason, I fed my cat this product given the recommendation of a good friend. As a result of feeding my cat this food, my cat became sick. Initially, she avoided eating this food at all. I influenced her, however, by mixing this kibble with freeze-dried chicken flakes (I intended on weaning her off of the chicken flakes). While I succeeded in having her consume this cat food, her behavior was strange, as she began begging.<br /><br />I completely gave up on this product after 2 weeks when my cat vomited after eating half of her meal that evening. While some cats vomit normally, my cat rarely vomits.<br /><br />While I would love for my cat to become vegan, I believe this is a pipe dream. I am forced to take Peter Singer's position on owning cats, i.e., if a vegan feels wrong about feeding a cat meat, then a cat may be the wrong companion. So, I will sigh and feed my cat a meat based food. If you can recommend a more "ethical" cat kibble, please do, and I would truly appreciate it.

review/summary: Great quality Food!
review/text: My dog used to be on Nutro Natural Choice - recommended by a petsmart clerk... and his stool was always soft-runny and he went maybe three to five times a day. He was also very stinky.  I switched him to Innova puppy food and let me tell you... the results were almost instantaneous.  In a week, he stopped smelling bad and his stool became hard and he only went twice a day.  It regulated his bowels so much I could not be happier.  He looks better and has more energy.  He will NOT go near the old food.  We wanted to know if he had a taste preference as we suspected that he was eating less of his old food right before we made the switch.  So we tried mixing the two foods and he would take a mouthful, spit it out on the ground, and only eat the Innova!  This food is so great for him! I am so happy.  Perfect ingredients for a young puppy.  Do yourself and your dog a favor, educate yourself by going to [...].  Don't feed your dog Iams or the other big brands like Nutro, Pedigree, Beneful... They put the worst stuff in their foods!

review/text: Long story short, I think my puppy is allergic to WHITE rice, which is ironic because that is what everyone tells you to feed your puppy when she has diarrhea. The situation got so bad I took her to the vet. Just want consumers to be aware of this possibility, that upgrading to premium dog food doesn't automatically mean better health for your dog! I've switched to another premium brand that has brown rice (which this does too) but not white rice. There was an *immediate* difference. (There were two other dog foods involved before and white rice was the major difference between the ones that upset my puppy's stomach and ones that didn't.)<br /><br />I wanted to give 1 star, but to be fair, the problem with the food was interaction between it and my puppy in particular, so I'll split the difference.

Counting out a serving and putting the rest away helps. I too did think it was a salty tasting cracker; however, if you have a salt craving it is absolutely wonderful. I did not find the the salt stats to be any worse than other crackers or chips. I do try to limit my sodium intake to 1,500 mg daily and find I can easily incorporate these into my diet if I just watch what else I'm eating.

I do like these much better than the Blue Diamond almond crackers and they have more flavor than many other rice crisps out there as well. The only problem is that they are noticeably salty, to the point I can taste the salt long after the cracker is gone. But then, that's probably part of why they taste so good. :) Still, if you are on a low sodium diet, you may want to skip these. I would have given 4 stars but had to take one back for the salt.

review/text: These were very tasty, but don't buy it as a present unless you're getting them something else along with it, as there are only 2 slices. It comes nicely wrapped and quickly, and goes faster still.

review/summary: Excellent, easy to make cake and cookies
review/text: A very good mix, easy to prepare  as a basic gingerbread and also a great base for additions  and variations (I sometimes make it with applesauce).<br />I made this with chopped dried fruit and a touch of brandy for a holidau  coffee cake and have added cinnamon,cardamom, and cloves to the mix for a spice cake that is a huge hit. The traditional rolled cookie variation is great tasting and holds up well in construction projects such as ginger bread houses,trains and ginger people. The soft cookie variation get raves, These usually disappear as soon as they are barely cool enough  to eat. These mixes also keep well in the pantry.

review/text: When I bought this, I thought it would be sweet enough without additives.  You definitely have to prepare icing if you're making cookies.  I haven 't yet baked the cake but the cookies were good.

review/summary: Medicinal taste
review/text: This is awful. It had an off-putting medicinal taste. Maybe if it was smothered in icing it would be better, but don't waste your money. I made it according to the directions and served it to people at Thanksgiving and not a single person liked it. I threw the whole thing away. It has nice texture and is attractive but the taste of this mix is just wrong.

review/summary: Memories.  brought by Amazon
review/text: Betty Crocker Gingerbread Mix brings fond memories of a childhood spent in a warm aromatic kitchen,  Mother and I would make Gingerbread and put real whipping cream on it for dessert after supper. Sometimes i would beat the cream too much and it would turn into butter, which was another treat.  Then when Christmas came, we made gingerbread men out of the same dough.  Dotted with raisins for buttons and eyes, these warm delicate treats promised the dawn of a holiday filled with love and family.  Betty Crocker may not have been there those many years ago, but the mixes have brought many memories of those days with much less work.  Now as I share those memories with one of my great-grandchildren, I thank you Betty Crocker and Amazon for bringing them here..

review/summary: The good, old-fashion taste.
review/text: What would life be without a big serving of ginger flavored cookies and cake? Normally I make gingerbread from scratch but this time I tried Betty Crocker's mix. It was great. The cookies came out of the oven and were cooling on the rack, the house smelled like a HOME and half of the cookies were gone before they had completely cooled. Now I must admit that I added some minced fresh ginger root to the mix. Also, I have added crystallized ginger on occasion and both have pepped up the intensity of the product. I am a ginger lover from way back. This is a good product and also a time saver. Worth a try if you have the craving for gingerbread or cookies.

review/summary: convenience is worth it!
review/text: This product was new to me - I like gingerbread and don't often make it - the flavor profile is not the kids' fave and the spices are not the ones I look at all the time!<br /><br />But these boxes are a nice convenience - be aware that it makes a small batch: a 9x9 pan, 2.5 dozen cookies or as I did a dozen muffins.  These have also frozen well!<br /><br />Not as good as homemade but certainly worth the difference in flavor to whip it up in moments!

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I ordered only one package of these because I wasn't sure that they would taste the same as the chocolate-covered gingerbread pretzels from Bahlsen that I had tried years ago.  These are as good or better.  The gingerbread is nice and soft (cake textured) and because I left the package in my car while it was cold out, the milk chocolate was nice and crisp, but melted in my mouth.  These are a good size - about as large as a homemade cookie.<br /><br />They go well with a nice cup of java...or they WENT well with a nice cup of java.  Unfortunately, my pack is now empty, so I'm going to stock up while they're still available.  So much for my diet!

review/summary: Perfect for cooking Indian food!
review/text: I had no idea how many spices were involved in Indian cooking before I started. Or how much of those spices was really just this spice. Cumin is awesome and everywhere. It's really nice to have 6 bottles of it so I don't have to worry about it if a recipe calls for 2/3 of a bottle of the stuff for some reason. I had first used McCormick Gourmet spices, which were fine, but I think that these are fresher, maybe because they are sealed twice. Definitely seems more potent out of the package than anything from the grocery store. If you're in the market for cumin, you've come to the right place.
