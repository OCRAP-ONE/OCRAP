review/summary: They did it again!  Yummy!
review/text: I do like Sobe Lifewater.  If you aren't a fan, then new flavors probably won't matter to you.<br /><br />I am not sure how long this one has been out, but do know that it is fairly new.<br />We finally found it in a grocery store here, and Hubby grabbed a couple of them.<br />I am SO glad that he did!<br /><br />This one is very tasty!  I am one of those who also has to smell everything before eating<br />or drinking it, and this one smells good too.  Then add the great eye-pleasing color on the<br />bottle, and well, it's a new favorite flavor.<br /><br />It's hard to describe the flavor. Obviously, they have kiwi and cherimoya, which is a spiny<br />fruit with a creamy white inside. It tastes very fresh and fruity, with a slight pear aftertaste.<br />I definitely recommend this one - pretty AND tasty!

review/summary: Very Good Meat Snack - Highly Recommended
review/text: Jack Link's "X-Stick Original" snack sticks are very good tasting and far less greasy than other "meat sticks" (like Slim Jim). These are great snacks for diabetics (like me) since they have a negligible amount of Net Carbs.<br /><br />The Amazon "Product Features" incorrectly lists these as 160 Calories each, and neither the box or individual packaging list the Nutrition Facts, so I visited the Jack Links web site and found the following:<br /><br />Serving Size: .5 Oz (1 stick)<br />Calories: 60 (45 from Fat)<br />Total Fat: 5g (2g Saturated Fat)<br />Cholesterol: 15mg<br />Sodium: 220mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 0g<br />Protein: 3g<br /><br />These do contain MSG, which can cause "gastric distress" in some people (like my dad).<br /><br />Overall, these are great as a snacks between meals and they are so much better than the competition.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Good Stuff!
review/text: These are along the line of Slim Jims but have a milder, less spicy, taste. The X-Sticks also have a much better texture than Slim Jims, these things actually look like they are made of real meat, NOT the 'mystery meat - goat hair/cardboard' texture of the modern Slim Jim.<br /><br />The X-Stick is 'not exactly' a health food snack. They have a fair amount of fat, a little over 5 grams (each stick, in this package, is 14 grams total mass). Sodium content is about 224 mg and, about 3.2 grams of protein and only 64 calories (about 47 calories from fat) per stick.<br /><br />What the X-Stick is, is a very satisfying snack. I sometimes have to miss a meal, due to my work. One or two of these take the hunger away and puts some energy back into me. I do try to limit my fat intake but do not feel guilty about snacking on these once in a while.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Ken

review/text: These are so much better than Slim Jim's they don't have that weird fur texture when you bite it; and as far as biting goes you can actually bite these without fighting with it. They taste good, but have that typical meat stick flavor. These are also MUCH easier to open than a Slim Jim. Packed well, arrived quickly and fresh.

review/summary: Great Meat Snacks
review/text: This review is for the 0.5 ounce X-Sticks box of 50.<br /><br />First I will comment on the taste.  The X-Sticks have a mild and pleasing flavor to them.  They taste similar to Slim Jims, just without the chemical spiciness and odd plastic texture of Slim Jims.  In a taste test, the X-Sticks would win without a problem.<br /><br />Next is the price.  The price for the box of 50 0.5 ounce X-Sticks tend to fluctuate on Amazon but it's still worth it, provided the price stays below $20 a box.  When you combine this with the Subscribe and Save discount, you can save even more!  The price of the same type of Slim Jims is almost $10 higher, so once again, the X-Sticks win.<br /><br />So my final thoughts are if you're looking for a meat snack that isn't going to repeat on you an hour later, these are the way to go.  Although they can't claim to be "All natural", they have more natural ingredients than the Slim Jim.  These also are composed of beef and pork (yum), whereas a Slim Jim is composed of beef and mechanically separated chicken...  (Eww).  Anyway, I was very happy with this purchase and I highly recommend them for you.

review/summary: Good for a snack --
review/text: I can't really compare these to other similar products (Slim Jim,etc.), as I had never had jerky-type snacks before I got these.  I decided to take a long road trip (4500 miles round trip), and I have a tendency to get drowsy if I don't get enough protein.  I decided to carry these plus some string cheese in the car to tide me over between meal stops.<br /><br />I really like these.  The flavor is good, the texture is fine, and the "damage" from a diet standpoint is minimal (these are 60 cal apiece, based on the Jack Links site).  They're not too salty, either.  Having them on the trip from Bellingham, WA to St. Louis, MO and back was a huge help.  One or two of these provided just the right amount of tasty protein.  The size and packaging is handy, too, and easy to open when driving.<br /><br />I now keep them on hand for when I need a little pick-me-up.

review/text: This was my second purchase. Watching carbs, I look for snacks that are high protein with low or no sugars. Tiring of nuts all the time I tired these a couple months ago. Very surprised, they taste good with a bit of spice kick. Recalling that most convenience store sticks were dry or greasy or blah tasting, it was nice to snack on these. They are not the long sticks but a nice size at about 6 inches. Wrapped individually and easy to open. Great item to grab when looking for a quick munch.

review/summary: Just okay -- not nearly a Slim Jim
review/text: While certainly edible, I don't think Jack Links brings a realistic competitor here with their version of the Slim Jim.  Honestly, there are some bites I take which remind me of dog food.  I know we are talking about meat sticks here and not fine dining, but the texture of these is just not right, almost too granular.  I know Slim Jims have that greasy taste but these guys have a bit of it too and I have to admit I kind of enjoy it.  Overall, in my opinion, Slim Jims are much much better than these guys, but to each his/her own!

review/summary: A bit on the greasy side, but the kids love them
review/text: Some fairly improved ingredients vs a typical 'slim jim', at least its not made with jowls and pink slime.  The taste is good, salty, smoky, a bit on the greasy side.  If you've had the x-sticks, this is just small pieces of that in a bag, four times the weight of the stick.  In other words, excellent for sharing or a snack at school where eating a whole stick might be a problem.<br /><br />I also dump a package into a ziploc and can snack on it a piece at a time to boost my protein and fat intake a bit.<br /><br />A pack of 12 lasted my 7 year old and his friends about a week, which is way faster than most other meat snacks I've put on the snack counter.<br /><br />But even the 7-10 year olds say its a bit greasy, as they devour another package.

review/text: Having never had the X-Links before, I bought them based off some customer reviews I read here. Maybe I should have read more, but these are most comparable to a Slim Jim. While they are much better, they still fall into the same category, and I was looking for something a little more "real" tasting. These have a much better taste than Slim Jim does, although there is still a substantial "artificial" taste. Highly recommended as a Slim Jim upgrade, but don't buy these if you're looking for a more natural tasting product.

review/summary: Great On-The-Go Snack
review/text: I just bought my second box of Jack's Links because I'm sold on these!  I purchased a box of small Slim Jim's for my son's lunch box and for throwing snacks in my bag for the long afternoons of driving kids around to activiities and someone ALWAYS asking if I have something to eat!!  The Slim Jims were just ok, but after time got really hard, even in their individually packaged cases.  So I bought the Jack Link's X Stick and immediately my 10 year old son said they were WAY better than Slim Jims.  The 0.5 oz size is a little bigger than the small Slim Jims, yet not too big so that I'm filling my kid with even more fat and junk.  This is just the right size for a "snack" and the price is great.  At Amazon today I bought a box of 50 on sale for $17, which is about .35 cents a stick.  Don't hesitate to buy these if you are like me and need a variety of on-the-go, non-refrigerated snacks or lunch box fillers!!  Great product!

I wouldn't even put them in the same universe as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFS57I">Jack Link's Beef Stick, Original, 0.92-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 72)</a> or any of the beef sticks that Jack Links makes based on the 'Original' formula/base. I dig all of their flavored stuff, spicy stuff, etc, as long as it's based on the original beef stick variety.<br /><br />The X Sticks taste... like potted beef, wrapped into a beef stick? I don't know, It's odd. I'm still going to eat all 50 of them or whatever; they're not awful. Just "okay"; and in my world of seriously loving beef jerky and beef sticks, being just "okay" is a crime...

review/summary: Pretty Good - Not Trash
review/text: Good stuff if you want a Slim Jim type of replacement that is of better quality.  Does not have that waxy taste that Slim Jim tends to offer.  If you want real beef jerky I'd pass on this.  In fact, I assumed they would be more like the regular bagged Jack Links (myfault) just in stick form.  This has that mixed spiciness that you cant really find in any of their regular flavors but did remind me of Slim Jim.  Tastes like a hot dog in a way which is good and they tend to do the job as far as giving me a boost.  I give it 3 stars but I am going right back to the regular bagged stuff which so wayyyyy better.

review/text: These were only .19 each after getting 40% off with Amazon's snack sale, which is incredibly cheap.<br /><br />My hubby likes them in his lunches and I like giving him anything that isn't loaded with sugar or starches.<br /><br />I recently had a Slim Jim after about 20 years without trying them and it was awful. I like the flavor of Jack's Links ten times as much.<br /><br />Easy to get into the package, too, just peel it back.

review/summary: Good jerky for a quick snack
review/text: I had tried one of the Jack Links snack pack, the kind that come with cheese, pretzel and meat, so after trying that, and loving it, I knew Id most likely enjoy this.  I took a bite from the first stick, and it wasn't too good, I guess it naturally tastes better with cheese IMO, but after eating the second and then third, they started to grow on me.  These things are perfect for that late snack and its convenient and does the trick for a hungry tummy.  They have a chewy consistency, but when you take a bite each time, you can hear a small snap from when you bite<br /><br /> I also like the design, you just remove a piece of cardboard from the bottom and it becomes a dispenser, which is a little nice idea. I ended up liking these so much, I am going to subscribe to receive these once a month.  Price is great and if you do that, you get a nice little discount (15% off).  I definitely recommend this.

review/summary: Individual Jack Links best for sharing
review/text: Have to admit I've never had Jack Links X-Stick (or any other Jack Links product) and have NO idea what they taste like.  I bought these because I know a Marine in Afghanistan loves them and so do his buddies.<br />This particular item is perfect for military CARE packages: each unit is individually wrapped so nothing goes stale or gets sand in it after the box is opened.<br />The small-size box is great for people without a lot of storage or 'personal' space.  The single-servings are ideal for sharing (without wiping yourself out of goodies) and fit into cammy pockets without taking up a lot of room or adding to the weight you're carrying.<br />They make a welcome change from MRE's or when you need a quick energy boost (the convoy can't always stop for lunch).<br />Even if you don't know if your 'fighter' likes them, I guarantee they'll be appreciated - remember when the kids traded lunches in school?  They may be older but trading goodies within the unit is a time-honored tradition, too!

review/summary: Meh
review/text: Edible, but not great. I picked these up because Amazon had stopped carrying Pemmican beef jerky (which hadn't been the same since the company was sold anyway) and I was looking for something to snack on. I like Slim-Jims ok when they're good (but quality control is a major issue with Slim-Jims, as for every good one you get, you're likely to get one that tastes rancid or worse).<br /><br />Obviously, these aren't like beef jerky, they're closer to Slim-Jims. The consistency seems to be much better than Slim-Jims and the price is pretty good. The flavor isn't as good as a good Slim-Jim, but is much better than a bad one, so it kind of evens out.<br /><br />I was hoping these would be closer to the "Matador" line of snack sticks that Jack Link's makes. For whatever reason, despite carrying many Jack Link's products at present, Amazon doesn't seem to have the Matador line.

It doesn't stick together. It also is great in casseroles as well with just sauce on top. Since my store is always low on supply, I subscribed to have Amazon ship this to me every 2 months.

If your neighborhood has ANY sort of Asian market, check there first.  I just picked up 6 bags (5oz each) for $1.59 each.<br /><br />Granted, I don't have a 'local' market, so when I get the chance to go to one, I stock up :-)  It doesn't take long for me to go through my stash.

review/text: I was introduced to these candies by my grandchildrens' Chinese language tutor. Are they chewy? They are pull-your-fillings-out chewy! Are they delicious enough that I don't care about the dentist bill? As SP would say, "you betcha!" If you like ginger, and you like spicy, I would choose these things over just about any candy out there (ok, if you need chocolate, you need chocolate, but I'm just sayin'). And since ginger is great for digestion, they also give me a great excuse to chow down on them after dinner. Try these babies. If you like them, chances are you won't have to share them. My experience has been that people either really truly love them or absolutely can't stand them. Enjoy!

review/summary: A Faint Hint of Orange Blossom
review/text: I used to order Dolfin orange blossom chocolates but they always seem out of stock or they would send me a totally different product by mistake. Finally I have found these delicious Newman's Own Organic chocolates. They have a hint of orange blossom instead of candied orange rind. The chocolate itself is superior to anything I've ever tasted. Such a pure flavor and not sour like some dark chocolates can be. Everything in this bar is organic and you can really taste the difference!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Best of the pumpkin kcups
review/text: This kcup was pretty tasty once you get past the weird smell while brewing.  It was described as a bit "funky" by some coworkers.  I tried it out anyway and was impressed.  It's very smooth and has a nice pumpkin flavor.  It gets better as it cools.  The clove flavor is only slighty noticeable which is a very good thing.  The flavor was pretty close to pumpkin pie.  This would mix really well with a good french vanilla kcup and some cinnamon.  The flavor is light years better than the Green Mountain pumpkin spice kcup. It took me a year to get through that box.  I threw out the last few.

review/text: While in college, you just need that extra push when studying or in lecture. These puppies have kept me through long exams and extensive readings. Would originally buy each bag individually at a local store, but figured buying in bulk would be cheaper. It definitely is, and I fill a mug with each bag to grab from my desk and for sharing. If you're a "Jollies" fan...this item is for you. You get 12 of those bags. and each contains enough "Jollies" (Original flavors, regular sugar, nothing fancy, just perfect) to fill a cereal bowl.

review/summary: Not Original, but it gets the job done. . .
review/text: These are probably the greatest hard candy known to man. Which is why they have lasted years on the market without any scrutiny. They are especially great if you have an oral fixation. Just don't chew on them or your teeth will hurt. My only grip is, like many other, that I know the truth. that is that the mix you get now is not the original Jolly Rancher mix. My favorite flavor 'Lemon' was discontinued and replaced with Blue Raspberry, and there is no where on the market where you can get a lemon Jolly Rancher anymore. I figured with numerous complaints and high demand Hershey would step up and reinstate the Lemon Jolly Rancher its place among the original bag. This however is not the case and us Lemon fans have to make do with Watermelon the next best thing to the sour yellow gold. Other than that these get the job done and are a good product.

review/text: Arriba Fire Roasted Mexican Salsa is outstanding. It has a peppery, smoky, roasted tomato flavor and is excellent for dipping chips, cooking, or as a toping. It does not have a lot of chucky tomatoes or peppers in it, which I prefer, but has a nice, even consistency. It is an excellent salsa - in fact it's one of the best I've tried. I prefer the hot variety, as I love spiciness, but they are all good.

I actually got an unexpected bonus.  I didn't read the description carefully and thought I was purchasing 1 package with 2 cups and servings, but it is actually two full packages of 2 cups each.  So I was able to give the 2nd package to another friend.  The item looked to me to be a fun, easy thing to fix on short notice.

review/summary: In a word, wonderful!
review/text: I ordered this and the 'Tender' steak pie on a whim after a watching a "Are You Being Served?" marathon one day. I've long been an Anglophile, and unlike some critics of Brit cuisine, I love the honest, stick to your bones quality of the food, particularly what could be termed standard pub and market fair. A good meat pie is hard to find state-side, but I've never encountered a tinned pie before so had no idea what to expect. Well consider me impressed. The tin itself was rather argumentive (more than a little muscle was needed for the can opener to do it's job), and once the lid was off the the sight that greated me was somewhat troubling - a pasty doughy disk with streaks of meat grease smeared over it. Undaunted, I resolved to follow the instructions and placed the tin on a foil lined metal tray in a preheated oven for roughly 25 minutes. The result was nothing short of miraculous. The pie came out with a puffy, flaky crust and smelling of rich, beefy gravy. The foil lining was a good call on my part - some of the gravy and a bit of grease had come out of the tin while baking, but the amount was small and the tin was hardly "messy". I left the pie undisturbed to cool for about 15 minutes, and when I finally dug in the result was a rapturous taste treat. Forkfull after forkfull of rich, meaty pie and minced veg swimming in a savory gravy made it's way into my mouth until I found myself taking a spoon to scrape up the last bits of meat, crust, and gravy clinging to the tin.<br /><br />Full? Yes. Satisfied? Very. Will I order again? I already have.

review/summary: It helps to keep my blood sugar level and fills me up
review/text: This producr is nowhere as tasty as BBQ flavored potato chips,but it is an excellent snack for diabetics.  I eat half a package (about 60 calories) as a between meal snack or before bedtime to control my hunger and keep my blood sugar from rising as it sometimes does while I sleep. You can eat them plain or with a low calorie, low fat spread such as The Laughing Cow light cheese wedge or a smear of toffuti cream cheese.<br />  I personally prefer the cinnamon flavor of this product, or the drizzles in chocolate or caramel.

review/summary: Satisfying but Expensive
review/text: My husband bought a variety pack of the Extend Crisps. So far, we've only opened the bag of the Honey Barbecue. Initially, they seemed powdery, but the flavor was good and I ate the entire bag  while he was distracted with a phone call. The crisps look like compact rice cakes, but are made out of soy and corn fiber. Unlike rice cakes, these are low on the glycemic index, although there is no indication on the bag, box they came in, or product Website where they rank. Even the peer-reviewed article from 1997 that the manufacturer uses to substantiate the product's efficacy ([...]l) at controlling blood sugar highs and lows provides no insights, which seems to be a pretty big oversight. I am not diabetic, so I cannot provide any first-hand reports of the product's ability to work as described.<br /><br />In summary, while I enjoyed the crisps and would certainly recommend others to give them a try, they are very expensive at close to $2 for a small bag. Other high-fiber, low glycemic foods are likely a better and less costly option for individuals with blood sugar issues.

review/summary: Peppery taste that I have grown to enjoy daily
review/text: Purchased this tea via Subscribe & Save because it was way cheaper than Tazo and the company responded to an email I sent them requesting the ingredients very quickly and with a most friendly response. (Impressive ingredient list BTW) I agree with the other reviewer that the taste is a bit unusual. When I opened the first of 6 bottles I now own, I did not really like the taste because I was so used to the sweetness and lightly spicy taste of Tazo. However, I am now on the third bottle of 500 Mile and I must say my opinion has changed. This tea is not very sweet (honey is used per the ingredient list), and it has a very spicy kick with definite pepper undertones. Usually, I mix it half/half with freshly brewed green tea and add a splash of vanilla almond milk or coconut milk. It is now my daily tea treat.<br />So, if you want a sweet tea that isn't too spicy you will want to stay with the Tazo Chai concentrate. However, if you want to kick up your chai a bit, give this a try. Also, the company (Tao of Tea) has a fascinating website devoted to tea, and makes for a great read if you want to learn more about teas.

Unfortunately, this has a very different flavor that I don't care for (note ingredients for this include black pepper and fennel).  It's okay for chai, but I'm not getting it again and will stick to brewing my own from leaves -- which is by far the amazingly-best chai I've found!
