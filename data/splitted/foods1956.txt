We originally got them from our vet, but found these at Petco and they were made by the same people and were cheaper.  Petco no longer carries them, so we order them on line--for even less!

It's also not as caustic as Mountain Dew or Pepsi Max is, at least to my pallet.  Just a clean flavor, but not as light as flavored water.  No caffeine is a plus as well.  Yummy.

review/text: These cheap lasers are super bright and the perfect interactive cat wranglers. You can easily and cheaply replace the batteries when they run low. I have no idea why they are marketed as keychains: who needs a laser on their keys? I mean, it isn't as if they're of any use for illumination.<br /><br />PS After a few days all 3 I bought had stopped working, so I opened 'em up, checked the batteries (three 1.5v cells per light), found all 9 were fine, lightly sanded the tops and bottoms of each cell with a nail file, then reloaded the cells carefully enough that so that the internal spring in each light functions unimpeded- presto, all work fine.<br /><br />You can crank up the intensity of these lasers by turning a set screw a little. Google this if you're curious. Be careful not to shine these things directly into any creature's eye.

review/summary: Melt in Your Mouth Delicious!
review/text: "Bounty" bars consist of a soft, almost molten center of sweet coconut coated in an outer layer of milk chocolate. You can easily buy them "over the counter" here in Australia. But if that's not the case where you are, and you don't mind a diet rich in junk food, then yes, this is a candy bar worth going to the trouble of ordering over the internet.<br /><br />Note that here on Amazon you can purchase bounty bars in boxes with varying numbers of bars inside, so it is worth your while to crunch the numbers and think about what package offers the best value for you. At the same time, it may not be entirely in the best interests of your health to have _too_ many of these things lying around at home all at once!<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: PINEAPPLE SNACK HAS UNDISCLOSED INGREDIENTS
review/text: I've tried almost all low calorie freeze-dried pineapple snacks out there.  I tried this one because of the positive reviews.  Sadly they were misleading.  This snack is imported from China.  It is low in calories because the packages are very small - only 35 per one-third ounce package.  The package is vague about ingredients and only states that "Each bag contains approximately 1/2 cup of pineapples."  That may be true, but there is definitely an aftertaste to this snack.  My guess is that there are one or more UNDISCLOSED additives or preservatives.  If you get past the aftertaste, then there is the strange consistency.  It's like biting into a piece of styrofoam.  It was not crunchy and definitely not "crispy" as the package states.  Let me tell you... after munching on this snack for a few minutes, my taste buds started to feel like they were burning.  I stopped eating and tried to wash out my mouth with water.  The burning sensation wouldn't go away.  Then my throat began to swell.  I immediately took a Benedryl and sat still until the swelling went down.  My taste buds took longer to calm down, but were fine the next morning.  My recommendation: if you have any sensitivity to food additives or preservatives stay away from this product.

review/text: I really thought I would dislike this product.  So much packaging, so little content.  But it's a great crispy treat for those trying to limit their calorie intake.  I found it very unique, sort of like petrified fruit with alot of flavor.  So, if you need a little package of sweet pineapple crispy things before bed - and don't want more than 35 calories - this is perfect.

review/summary: Hershey's syrup is garbage !
review/text: I grew up using Hershey's syrup over all others since the 1960's and ever since the use of a plastic container to cut costs,  chocolate milk made with the syrup is disgusting! That or the company is short-changing the public with a chocolate subsitute that doesn't come close to the original. Even a spoonful tastes like crap. I recently threw out a new bottle because I finally realized after over a year that the syrup was substandard, used in milk or as a topping.<br /><br />I hope Hershey doesn't continue degrading other products. Hersheys is a traditional Amercan trademark going back decades and a part of generations of chocolate lovers' pasts.

review/summary: Tried them all but THESE ARE THE BEST!!!  (no nausea!)
review/text: I LOVE this pills - that seems weird to say - but they're fantastic.  I started taking them to supplement my prenatal pills a long time ago after reading a ton of articles about how important DHA is to the brain development of your baby.  I found that every prenatal pill I tried that had DHA already in it either didn't have the full recommended amount of DHA and/or made me SO nauseous!  I actually read that it's better to take a regular prenatal pill AND a DHA supplement than trying to find an all-in-one pill because they tend to cut corners on the nutrients when they combine it all.  I was relieved to learn that because the all-in-one pills are all terrible anyway in terms of taste and nausea.  My doctor gave me a huge bag of samples and they were all awful.  So it's better to go with a supplement, and this is the best one there is.<br /><br />If you're doing tons of Paranoid Mama research on this - YOU CAN STOP HERE AND JUST BUY THIS ONE.  I'm about halfway through my pregnancy now and it took us three years to get pregnant and I also had a miscarriage along the way, so I'm super paranoid about the health of my unborn baby!  Trust me, if it's out there - I've read it or tried it already!  These pills are perfect.  They give you all you need (as a SUPPLEMENT to your prenatal pill) but without the fishy taste or nausea issues.  I've been taking these for over a year now (I always took them when we were doing fertility treatments just in case I was pregnant) and I would never switch now.  My new OB started to recommend a bunch of prenatals and DHA supplements and when I told her what I was already taking she stopped right away and said "Oh never mind, you should keep taking that one, that's great!!"  So there you go - doctor recommended!  :)<br /><br />I also love that these are gel pills because they don't get pasty/chalky or suddenly have a funky taste when they get wet like most pills.  This is great for me because sometimes it takes me a little while to swallow pills and it's great to not have it dissolving in my mouth by the second.  The pills are also a pretty small size compared to other DHA pills out there, so it goes down very easy.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can think of is that these only come in packs of 60, but now that I am doing Amazon's subscribe and save, this is no longer an issue.  I actually save money and get it delivered right to my door when I start to run out without even thinking about it!  This is a fantastic service, not only for the savings, but because you don't want to miss a single day of giving your little baby everything he/she needs just because you don't have time to go the store and get more pills.<br /><br />(Try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PLHIUI">Spring Valley Prenatal Multivitamin, 240 tablets</a> if you're trying to find a nausea-free prenatal pill too)

Lo and behold, right there in the FAQ's, it clearly states the gelatin in THIS particular supp comes from bovines - aka cows. Spectrum does carry a vegetarian DHA supplement as well.

review/summary: Did not upset my stomach like Expecta DHA
review/text: I took the Expecta DHA supplement from Enfamil for over half my pregnancy.  It always upset my stomach in some fashion, even though I was strict to always take it with a good amount of food.  Finally the upset stomach drove me to try out something else.  I tend to skew more towards natural products anyways (my prenatal vitamin is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Z9577C">Rainbow Light Complete Prenatal System, 360-Count</a>) so it was a little surprising that I had opted for the big name brand to begin with.  I went hunting here on Amazon, and based on ingredients/sources and reviews I opted to try these Spectrum DHA supplements.  Man has it made a world of difference.  While I couldn't recommend taking them on an empty stomach, I've never had these upset my stomach (I do always take mine with dinner).  I used to dread taking my DHA supplement, but now with these Spectrum pills, I hardly give it a second thought.  I can definitely recommend giving these a try if you're struggling the same way I was.

review/summary: No fishy burp at all
review/text: I used this exact brand of DHA during my first pregnancy and now again on my second pregnancy. I specifically chose this brand because of the source of DHA, algal oil, which claims to result in much less fishy taste/burping.  I haven't had any bloating, gas, or burping issues as a result of taking this supplement.  I would definitely recommend this product to others.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the way in which Amazon.com packed and delivered the product. I live in California and the day it was delivered it was 90F and probably much hotter in my mailbox. The heat caused all the gel pills to stick together making it frustrating to pull apart and take a pill each day.  I contacted Amazon.com about the poor shipping conditions and that it should be ice packed, but never heard back.  I hope my next subscribe and save shipment doesn't arrive like the last bottle did.

review/summary: Spectrum Prenatal DHA causes gas, burping and bloating
review/text: I like the idea of a non-fish based DHA supplement and I bought two bottles at Wholefoods. I couldn't get past the first bottle of Spectrum Prenatal DHA. It causes me such gas, bloating and burping although that doesn't seem to be the case for other reviewers. Has anyone else experienced this problem? I read that possibly the quality of the product could cause stomach upset but this brand seems to be one of the better ones and yet, it upsets my stomach very much. The expiration date on the Spectrum pills I bought is October 2013 so they're in good condition. I was taking Prenate before, which has a purified form of fish oil and never had stomach upset. That being said, each person is different so I would definitely try out any supplement first before stocking up.

review/summary: Outstanding Honey
review/text: All honey is not the same!  I purchased the Sourwood honey 3-pack and previously had the Wildflower honey from Organic Mountains and while we love them both, the Sourwood is my personal favorite.  The Wildflower honey has a lighter and more mild flavor which some may prefer.  Anyone not familiar with the Sourwood tree, it is a native plant that mainly grows in forests in the Southeastern US.  The tree's name bears nothing in resemblance to the sweet, rich, deeply complex flavored honey produced by the Honeybees that gather it's nectar and turn it into this amazing tasting honey.<br /><br />As other reviews have noted the self sealing lids on the squeeze bottles are great and take away the mess normally associated with pouring honey.

review/summary: Slim Tea Bags
review/text: Purchased this for my wife and she loves it. We brew most of our herbal teas from fresh or home grown herbs, however, with this mix of herbs it is easier to purchase than to mix. The instructions for use leave allot to be desired and differ from how we learned to brew herbal teas, so we just alter them to suit our experience. The smell and color helps me believe that the herbs are fresher than most prepackaged teas.

review/summary: My favorite flavor
review/text: I have used these teas off and on for years. When you first start using them, they WILL give you wicked cramps. You then become more used to the senna in the tea and it eases up. Basically this tea speeds along digestion. So you will be visiting the restroom more quickly than had you skipped the tea. The amount of food you eat will also affect the teas 'outcome'. The more you have eaten, the less effective the tea is. This and the honey lemon are my favorite flavors. The original is NOT one I will drink. The taste of the Senna is way too strong. I also brew the tea longer, sometimes 20 minutes, and use two tea bags if I have had a very large meal. This isnt a tea I would use on a daily basis. Great for fasting and cleansing though.

review/summary: Good Cultural Chocolate....Bad Tasting Chocolate
review/text: I have been to Salzburg, Austria, and bought a box of this Mozart Chocolate. It was interesting to get, because everywhere in Salzburg had a sign advertising this. Sadly,I personally did not think that it was very tasty. The pistachio filling had a bad texture, and did not mix well with the type of chocolate used. If you are going to Salzburg, get it only to experience this interesting piece of culture. I would not recomend, however, that you order one hundred pieces of it from Amazon for such a high price.

The aroma even leaked out of the sealed jar, and the salt makes a wonderful addition to eggs, potatoes, and the like.  Italian white truffles are THE truffle in Italy, and this salt comes from the region that is famous for them.  Unfortunately they are prohibitively costly, but this product, albeit not cheap, comes the closest to those amazing truffles I have experienced since I went to Alba many years back.  Highly recommended.

I've tried multiple textures and flavors (not personally, of course...it's CAT food) and this one is a definite hit. The way she attacked it this morning made me suspect it's made from narwhals or unicorn meat or perhaps *bites knuckles* baby fur seals. Whatever it is, it's an epic win as far as Allie is concerned. The pate texture is easy for her to eat, the smell is mild and inoffensive, and the price is very reasonable.

review/text: I purchased these on whim because I"m trying to eat healthier and work out more to shed some pounds before my 24th birthday. A big thing for me is snacking, if I go without snacking I tend to over eat during meal time and put on weight fast because of the starve/binge pattern. With these, I just put them on my desk at work and have a healthy snack between meals and save money too! I eat a light, healthy breakfast and pack a healthy lunch, with these I don't have to worry about being hungry mid-day...which helps me eat a light dinner and stay within my calorie limit. These are great to add to your diet/exercise regimen to get some natural energy, protein and of course, anti-oxidants!

review/text: I've been drinking this since I was expecting my son and wanted a hot drink that didn't have so much caffeine (he's 18 now).  This product has a lot of sugar, but it also has tons of flavor.  I am heavy-handed with the "coffee" to water ratio. I have tried a lot of the other flavors but always come back to this one.  I also notice when I buy it at the store that this flavor tends to run out first so, apparently, other people agree with me.  I can buy it by the can in Houston stores for under $3.50 each so don't pay much more than that.  They have repackaged it and it now comes in the stores in a 9 oz. can so the 9.9 oz. is from the older lots.

review/summary: A tasty treat
review/text: My 6-year-old daughter is allergic to every artificial food color. That makes it difficult to find tasty treats for her. These have a wonderful natural strawberry flavor. They are not super sweet, just right. The reason that I had to give them 4 stars was for the texture. They are a bit hard. Mind you, it did not keep us from eating all of them.  Maybe actually it is a good thing because it made us take longer to eat them! I am actually coming back now to try the raspberry vines.

review/text: Bought BaaBaaQ lamb lung in he past for my chihuahuas in the 5# box. That size was no longer available. Tried these; I like them better. These are evenly sliced and dried like potato chips. BBQ were more "natural" and thicker shaped (uneven thickness, had bits of fat and connective tissue). ValueBull is "cleaner" and nicer to handle - no grissel! Dogs love them since the thinner slices are easier for the older dogs to eat. Also, hardly any "crumbs" at the bottom of the box. BBQ had a couple of handfulls so Valuebull had more useful product; no waste.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: This box had very large pieces, which are great for a special treat, and smaller pieces that can be used for training. My GSD absolutely loves the lambs lung! She will go tap the box because she knows what is inside! I love to use these for training. She is very food motivated and these treats do not fill her up so we can train much longer without her losing interest, and she is still able to eat her normal meal. Will definitely order more, worth every penny spent! Would also like to say that there is a lot of product, 5.5 lbs of lambs lung is a lot because it is so light in weight! You cant go wrong with this purchase!

review/summary: Well Pleased
review/text: Tried ValueBull's Sliced Lamb Lung 5.5 lb after BaaBaa Q's was no longer available and am very pleased with the product.  I bought it through Value Pet Supplies on Amazon and it arrived in one large plastic bag (boxed).  Luckily I had saved 4 of the 1 lb. zip-lock bags from the BaaBaa Q's and made the transfers which makes storage a lot easier.  For the remainder I used a couple of gallon zip-locks.<br /><br />The product itself is consistantly thin and brittle with very, very few "burnt" pieces and only a handful of crumbs and dust at the bottom.  I'm glad that they're easy to snap into small bite-size pieces.  Many of the BaaBaa Q's had to be broken apart with a nutcracker and the many burnt pieces were handed off to my neighborhood large dogs who will eat anything!  With these new, thinner slices there is hardly any waste. Good value!  Sorry, big dogs!<br /><br />I was initially afraid that my Shih Tzu, who is a very picky eater, wouldn't like the change after 12 years of BaaBaa Q's but she loves them! We're both happy.

review/summary: Short product! Seller issue Happy Dog Place, INC
review/text: First off, I researched lamb lung because i know my dog likes it and it is not as rich as liver treats.  The previous reviews here mention that it is sliced thin.  Mine came just like the picture.  I think they are whole dehydrated lungs.  I would bet money that your dog will like them ALOT!  I wanted to buy in bulk for the value so I chose the ValueBull USA Sliced Lamb Lung 5.5 lb.  What I received was different.  It was five of these bags in a box.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ZQ4JIW">PCI Lamb Crunchys, Lamb Lungs, 1lb. Bag</a>  The seller I received my order from had taken an address label with the words "1.2 lb. value pack" and stuck it over the original manufacturers label of 1 lb.  I was upset because that is dishonest.  I weighed two of the bags while still in original packaging.  One weighed 1 lb. 1 and 1/4 oz  the other 1 lb. 1 and 1/8 ounce.  When I weighed the empty packaging it weighed 1 and 1/4 ounce.<br /><br />Low and behold the original manufacturers label was right on the money, and the address label stuck over it was wrong.  Five one pound bags were sold as 5.5 pounds.  Luckily it was fulfilled by Amazon and when I called they were able to make a satisfactory adjustment in price and said that they would address the issue with the seller.<br /><br />Product is great your dog will love it.  Amazon came through with a satisfactory resolution on first call.  I however had to spend time to rectify the situation and submit a review to let others know about the issue.  I will try to upload the photos I took with the bogus labeling and scale weights.<br /><br />Five stars for the product.  Five stars for Amazon for making it available to everyone at a good value and giving a credit for missing product.  Zero stars for the seller who mislabeled and misrepresented the product.

Although it's a little pricey on line and the shipping is exhorbitant, it's worth it! I usually order 2-3 boxes at a time. One day I'm going to venture out and try one of the other flavors.

Since I drink mostly Celestial Seasonings iced herbal teas (which I make with stevia since I'm diabetic and holistic) I didn't know what to do but I found two flavors that work very well together -- True Blueberry and Moroccan Pomegranate Red. I used two bags of each, sweetened to taste, in each half gallon of water.

review/summary: Adulterated with Soy lecithin
review/text: Either Celestial Seasonings simply forgot to update amazon.com, or else it's a deliberate omission on the part of Celestial Seasonings, but you should be aware that soy lecithin is an unlisted ingredient in this blueberry tea. It's also in all the "Zinger" teas I've checked in local stores and in other Celestial Seasonings teas as well. But it's not listed here on amazon.com in the "ingredients" section. I phoned the company last spring when I first noticed this "adulteration" because I couldn't imagine why anyone would add soy lecithin to tea! I've nothing against soy lecithin. Sometimes I add it to yoghurt, but that's my own choice. Also, the source should be organic (or from a reliable supplier like Lewis Labs), since non-organic soy is almost always genetically modified.<br /><br />Anyway, I phoned the company's customer relations department and asked what was going on with the soy lecithin. The woman had no idea what I was talking about so I explained, step by step, what I had found on a Zinger tea box I had nearly purchased that day. She said she had heard nothing about it but she checked her computer for company updates. After scrolling through many items, she came to a small notice in, as I recall, their in-house March 2008 entry (a year prior to my call), which stated that soy lecithin would now be added to selected teas; no reason was given. That struck me as very odd -- that even their own employees had not been properly notified. The woman apologized for the mix-up. That wasn't very satisfactory from my point of view but I let it go. That's all the info she had and it certainly wasn't her fault that her company obviously wanted to fly under the radar on this one.<br /><br />Since then, any time I'm attracted to a new Celestial Seasonings product, I first read the ingredients. They used to be a company I trusted -- not anymore -- although I still love their (as-yet) soy-free Bengal Spice; India Spice Chai; Nutcracker Sweet Holiday Tea; Sleepytime; Echinacea Complete Care; Vanilla/Strawberry/Rose Ceylon Black Tea; Moroccan Pomegranate; and Red Safari Spice.  But I now carefully check those labels too whenever I buy a new batch lest Celestial Seasonings have pulled a fast-one and added soy lecithin to them as well!<br /><br />Why haven't customers raised more of a hullabaloo over this? Probably because this company has indeed had our trust for many years (never mind that they've been sold to less trustworthy firms along the way!) and no one bothers to read their labels! Maybe now they will.<br /><br />(P.S. I'm a blueberry fiend and would probably make this my all-time favorite tea! -- but not with soy lecithin in it!!)

review/summary: An excellent summertime tea
review/text: Springtime in Central Texas signals a turn towards lighter and more refreshing flavors of tea, especially for those of us who drink gallons of the stuff iced.<br /><br />True Blueberry is a staple around our house during the spring and summer months. It's been difficult to find at our local grocery store, and I was glad to see it back on the shelf. Buying the "six-pack" that Amazon is offering here is a good option for those of us who will probably make it often over the course of the next few months.<br /><br />The Celestial Seasonings brand is a virtual guarantee of quality and freshness. They rarely miss the mark with a flavor, and the True Blueberry is one of their best. Sweeten it just right and you get a delicious tea that goes down smooth and smart on a hot afternooon or a cool, breezy evening. Most excellent all the way around. I've never bothered to try it hot. This flavor just SCREAMS ice tea, and that's exactly how I recommend that you drink it.<br /><br />Try brewing it as a sun tea, ot just leave a few bags in a pitcher in your fridge for a few hours. It's worth the wait, guaranteed.
