review/summary: Good But TOO Pricey
review/text: I spend a lot of time making lattes and I've used Starbucks, illy, and Lavazza pods all ordered on Amazon. Right now illy is $.88 a pod, Lavazza is $.525 a pod, and Starbucks is $.4125 a pod. Which actually suprised me. illy pods take about half the time Starbucks pods take, I think this is because the grounds are not as tightly packed. With illy and Lavazza I have had a couple pods break, or water leak out of my machine, found out it was due to the extra little grip lip on the pod itself so after I cut those off no more leaking. I actually enjoy the taste of illy over Starbucks but in these times where money is tight. I'll stick with the Star-"bucks" to save a few.

review/summary: convenient.. but worth the price???
review/text: On average my wife an I drink 1-2 expressos daily and a few months ago bought a delonghi bar32 expresso maker. I purchased this product just to see what all the hype was. It seemed from people I talked with and some reviews that some people really think this is a great tasting product. After going through the 2 boxes I can say it does taste good, but I still prefer fresh ground. It is hard to explain, but these pods had a distinct taste, not like the fresh ground I make or what you would expect at Starbucks. The taste isn't bad, just distinctly different, which may be what people that rate it high like. For me I enjoyed the convenience of the pods, but wouldn't regurally pay extra for the taste.

review/summary: Excellent pods and good for free shipping
review/text: My wife loves these pods for her quick and easy twice a day espresso hit.  And I love them because, unlike how we used to buy them in units of ten boxes, here I can get two boxes at a time, which means that whenever I want to buy something for less than $25 I just toss this into the order and can get free shipping anytime.  Since she uses about a box a week, and I don't order more than once weekly, it works out perfectly.  And the coffee is excellent coffee if you like a dark roast pod.

review/summary: Best-in-class For ESE Pods
review/text: Because of time constraints in the morning, I've been trying different ESE pods. These blew me away! Maybe I got a fresh batch, but I am having a tough time distinguishing these from my fresh ground beans. Rich, flavorful and lots of crema. Very robusto. Makes a superb latte!  Stands up well in the the steamed milk. Price-wise, I save a bit vs. stopping for a grande Starbucks latte and get a much better flavor.<br /><br />One tip: I read this in another review, and I'll confirm that dampening the pod before use works well for me for the best seal and pull.<br /><br />Regarding some of the comparisons to Starbucks in other reviews, I've tried both @ home, and to me the Starbucks doesn't come close.

review/summary: Overpriced
review/text: I'm not a gourmet, just someone who looks forward to her morning latte. I typically make a 12-oz latte with a single shot.  I like saving money by making my own lattes, but don't want to take the time or deal with the mess of grinding beans, so I prefer pods. I recently bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F49XXG">De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker</a>, and was inspired to expand my horizons beyond Starbucks espresso pods, so I tried a few different brands. Given the price, I expected these to be very good, but was unimpressed.  The taste is not significantly less bitter than Starbucks, and the aroma less appetizing. They do give a good pull in my machine, but to me are not worth the price premium.  These are E.S.E espresso pods, made for espresso machines with E.S.E pod adapters. They are not for Senseo or K-cups machines.

review/text: When I bought my espresso-cap machine (Delonghi 32), i was expecting to blend my own espresso grinds, experimenting with flavor and taste.<br /><br />Then I had a kid and that whole idea went out the door. Heck, I don't even buy coffee beans anymore.<br /><br />The Illy pods are extremely convenient, and provide a distinct smooth taste that I don't get at say Starbucks or some Italian restaurants around here that make their own espresso. I like the flavor. Not too strong, like say Starbucks, but not weak other. Has a little sweetness to it, strangely, and that could be just my taste buds.<br /><br />I don't like the price, but too be honest, I've already done "the save and subscribe" and am on my 2nd shipment. Look: it's convenient, and as a new dad who needs an extra kick here and there, well - this does the job.

I highly raccomand it to everyone, because if you like coffe you can't help but love it, and if you don't like coffe, you will love Illy anyway. It's just too god.

review/text: We've been using the Illy packets since buying our small espresso maker over a year ago, and we had been fairly satisfied with the results. At least they were consistent, and we didn't have to clean up coffee grounds. However, despite the added mess of using beans the results we get by using freshly ground coffee in our inexpensive mill produce a somewhat better flavor, depending on the roast, etc. that we buy. We're sticking with beans now.

review/text: If there had been more information about these olives I could have chosen better. I love the Ionian green olives so I tried another Peloponnese product. I think this is an excellent company, the olives are meaty and attractive, but I don't like olives with a bunch of dried herbs flavoring them. To their credit, that flavor is not as heavy handed as some. Oregano just seems to get stronger and stronger, and to me, very objectionable. I'm going to get some more Ionian Greens - unflavored, straight up olives. I'm sure there's room in the refrigerator for 10 pounds of olives....

review/text: If you are ever tempted to buy Peloponnese country olives because Byzantine country olives are not available, I have a word of advice: don't. In fact, I would say more generally, don't ever. The problem for me is twofold. One, they are mushy, never firm. Two, they are in a briny water that is heavily flavored with herbs, primarily oregano I think, which gives them a very salty, pungent and unpleasant taste. What is worse is that they all taste the same, when they are supposed to be a mix. I would never buy them again.

review/text: This is a very good assortment( some large, some small, some black, some green). Our shipment arrived with minimal damage to the olives.  The taste is good.  We drain the olives add a pierced jalapeno pepper or two to a jar and then fill to completely cover the olives with good quality olive oil.  Olives prepared this way are not refrigerated and will keep for months. Just place them on your counter top away from direct sunlight or in the pantry and enjoy. After the olives are gone you can use the flavored olive oil for cooking.  This is a particularly good value when you sign up for a regular subscription ( comes to about $6/ per pound).  We eat lots of olives so this is a good deal for us. I also find a jar of olives to be a good hostess gift for friends.

review/summary: "Long lasting" - not so much
review/text: First off, I have to give kudos to Rachael Ray for making products without byproducts and artificial colors. I have a 4 year old pug who loves anything rawhide but has some allergy problems, so I've been trying out other products to see what can fit her needs.<br /><br />She is currently gnawing on the last of the 3 chews that came in the pack I bought (all this flavor) - the "soup bones" smell pretty tasty, and she appears to love them, but my chief complaint is that these bones are supposedly "long lasting". I gave my pug the soup bone 1 minute before I started typing, and without taking any breaks from where I am currently typing at (about 2 minutes into this review), the bone is 3/4 gone. Knowing her, and the noises I'm hearing, she's demolishing that last quarter, putting it at roughly a 4 minute treat. To me, that is not very lengthy of time.<br /><br />TL;DR: This product will last roughly 4 minutes in the mouth of any dog that has ever had more than 25 rawhides in their life; probably tastes good, no splintering (as promised).

review/text: Many vocal critics of illy coffee have never actually tasted it. As Dr. House says, everybody lies and illy is apparently a very popular thing to lie about. I've caught several vocal critics lying about illy (by serving it to them, getting the typical "This is fabulous!" reaction, then telling them what they're drinking. You know, the Folger's Coffee Crystals technique).<br /><br />Why is this?<br /><br />Well, on the surface illy does appear to be frivolous and therefore an easy target.<br /><br />- It's very expensive, especially for coffee that comes in a can<br />- It's got a very fussy, very European marketing envelope around it<br />- It tends to be sold in fussy, trendy stores<br />- Because it's roasted and packaged in Italy, it is always several months old when you buy it<br />- Did I mention that it's very expensive?<br /><br />As a result, it's easy to dismiss illy as an elitist, "image" product that can't possibly be worth what it costs. And it's easy to convince others of the same thing, whether you've actually tried illy or not.<br /><br />The truth is illy is really superb coffee, just about the best I've ever tried. Since I've started drinking it at home, I've found I'm actually drinking much less coffee overall, because I only know a couple of places that serve illy locally and I just don't feel like bothering with anything else, at least most of the time. The ironic net effect of this is that illy may actually be saving me some money!<br /><br />I don't know if illy will be worth what it costs to you. There are some very good coffee beans sold by Costco for roughly 1/5 the price, much better than anything you can get at Starbucks or Peets. (In fact, if Starbucks or Peets is your idea of really good coffee, stop reading this now. Not because I think you're some tasteless boob, but because those brands are in the very modern, very successful mode of bitter, over-roasted, burned-tasting American coffee and I don't personally care for that. So if you like those brands, you're probably not going to like illy or any coffee that I like. Personally, I like the bottomless cup of Peerless my favorite diner serves much better than Starbucks.)<br /><br />What I do know is that if you like coffee enough to own a decent grinder and other caffeine paraphernalia, you really ought to try illy. In particular, if you like light-medium roasts but find most are just too wimpy, you may just love this stuff.<br /><br />If not, you'll at least have a cute, fussy  little can you can sub-divide some of your Costco walnuts into. And that is something.

review/text: Illy espresso beans are my favorite of all the widely available commercially produced roasted espresso beans. This is the standard medium roast that Illy produces and it is a bit less aggressive and milder tasting than the dark roasts of Lavazza (the other major Italian brand that some people favor).<br /><br />When properly ground, tamped, and brewed Illy espresso has a delightful aroma and flavor, unmatched by any of the other brands.<br /><br />Granted, Illy is quite pricey, and I do not use it all the time for this reason. However, you get what you pay for. Usually, I buy my espresso from a small roasting house in the Midwest that produces a decent medium roast substitute that I do not mind using most of the time. But Illy definitely produces a higher quality bean.<br /><br />One way to judge the quality of roasted espresso beans even before you taste the coffee that they will produce is to look at the evenness of color and size of the beans. The reason is that beans of a uniform size tend to roast more evenly than beans of varying sizes. Moreover, even when the beans are of a uniform size, it is important that they be roasted in small batches and churned during the the entire roasting process to ensure that they all get roasted to the same point. This is why most high quality coffee is roasted in small batches in a rotating drum that roasts all the beans to the exact same point. Moreover, since the moisture content of the beans varies a bit from batch to batch, quality control in the roasting process is extremely important. And it is here that Illy is unmatched. Just do a simple visual comparison of the color and consisteny of Illy beans when compared to any of the other widely available brands and you can easily see why Illy is the best.

review/summary: Best vacuum-sealed beans if you can't get fresher
review/text: My adventure with coffee started years ago; I've been through a Jura-Capresso S9 (Super-automatic) and eventually found my way to a Rancillio Silvia V3 espresso machine.<br /><br />My hunt for good beans (Tucson, AZ) has been as variable, eventually being able to find decent fresh-ish beans at the local Whole Foods-type-place (Sunflower). Of all the mail-order, vacuum-sealed, "older" beans I've tried (including any main-stream beans like Milestone) from a super market, these Illy are much better, but compared to real, fresh beans, they don't quite stand up.<br /><br />Taste-wise these beans are much smoother than I expected; because they are vacuum-sealed and typically 2-4months old by the time you get them, I expected the dry/sharp/bitter taste that I get from every other bean I've tried (you ever tried Starbucks beans? Good lord, bitter) and was surprised when they actually ended up being quite a bit smoother.<br /><br />The smell during grinding is a typical "dry/old" bean smell, it doesn't have that lustrous smell that a fresh bean does and when pulling the shot it doesn't have that carmel-colored, never-ending crema that a fresh bean gives, but surprisingly enough, it tastes pretty nice.<br /><br />At my Whole Foods-esque store, I can get fresh-ish beans for $7.99/lb, at roughly $36/lb it is *impossible* for me to justify these Illy beans.<br /><br />If you are in a location where fresh-beans are an impossibility and you have been relegated to super-market, main-stream garbage beans, and you don't mind paying the premium, these beans are quite nice and should keep you pretty happy.<br /><br />If you are a bean-snob and demand perfect behavior of your beans through the grind/shot sequence, then you probably need to keep looking and need to move somewhere where fresh coffee is more readily found :)

review/summary: Way better than Starbucks
review/text: I've been drinking espresso since 1983 when I was introduced to it by Signor Forza in Rome. I found out that Italians have a saying "Only women and babies drink cappucino after 9:00". What that means is that all the men take a coffee (espresso) break at 9:00. Well since I returned to the states in 1985 I have tried all kinds of expresso beans, using mostly Starbucks. I happened across a can of Illy beans at a Tucson store. I vaguely remembered the Illy brand from my 8 months in Italy and decided to try it. It is inarguably the best espresso I have had since returning from Italy.

review/summary: Simply great coffe beans!!!!
review/text: I have had esspresso from here to china in many different shops.  I know my coffee and espresso.  As coffee is a very personal prefrence take this for what it may.  There is no bitterness (though some skill is needed in making it) the flavor is rich, smooth, and consistent.  that is where illy is a step ahead of others.  Notice the consistent bean size in an Illy can.  this leads to constent roasting of the beans.  This leads to constent flavor.  Weather you prefer a dark roast or a medium the bean size uniformity is key to the roasting and processing steps of the process.  a good analogy is does angel hair pasta need to boil for as long as a thick ziti.  No if you did the angel hair would be mush by the time the ziti was done.  Well cofee beans can be over or under done for the same reason thickness and size drive rates.<br /><br />One thing I would say to some one concered about the price.  For 16 dollars I get a week of espresso's.  I used to spend this in D&D or starbuck in 2 days, and it was not as good!<br /><br />If you really enjoy your coffee you should give it a try, if you still really like starbucks after that I would be shocked!!!  It would be a challange for me to go to starbucks again unless I am in an airport and no where serves Illy!<br /><br />For me it is well worth it

review/summary: Not close to Kicking Horse
review/text: I bought a can of Illy whole bean coffee, hearing so many wonderful things about it. The beans are good, flavor decent, rarely bitter but didn't find anything truly special about the coffee. Bought a can of Kicking Horse 454 to compare. The beans are very oily and aroma far more overpowering than the Illy. It may be too strong but it was clear that these beans were very fresh and full bodied. While 454 is a dark roast, even the medium roasts seem to have the same experience. One of my friends called Illy "airport coffee" and while I think it's a cut above the cheap, I'm not sure I disagree with him. I certainly think Peet's is better than Illy. Perhaps it's meant for espresso machines, I don't know. But at this price, I don't think it's worth it. Everything is a matter of taste, of course, but if you get a chance to look at the beans from other brands, you might be surprised. I certainly was.

review/text: The product, as listed, is a CASE of 24, 1.5 ounce boxes of pudding mix.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the box to find ONE box (1.5 ounce, 6 servings) instead of the expected 24.  This leads to a call to Amazon with a customer service representative who unfortunately didn't know what Jell-O pudding was and was having a hard time understanding that there had been an error in the number of items shipped.  Ummmm...<br />who would pay $30 for six 1/2 cup servings of pudding???  This was finally understood and another order was placed (kindly, they did not require me to return the single box of pudding).  Low and behold, several days later the package arrives... AGAIN another single box of pudding instead of a case of 24 boxes.  Another phone call to Amazon, another rep who doesn't quite understand but finally decides to just credit me for the order and not require that I return the single package.  It was decided that we would not try to place the order again, as it would appear the warehouse has a problem filling orders for this item.  I orderd the chocolate flavor case of 24 and it arrived without problem... a carton of 24 boxes of pudding mix, as expected.

review/text: Illy is the perfect espresso blend for people who haven't invested in a $600 burr grinder. Instead of trying to describe its qualities, let me relate a story:<br /><br />This summer we went on a houseboat vacation where I was subjected to God-awful drip coffee for a week.  As soon as we got off the boat I hit up a  Starbucks, which was of course disappointing.  Then, when I got home, we were out of Illy.<br /><br />On Monday morning I tried to make my espresso with some of Trader Joe's Espresso Blend, and while I love the Trader's, their espresso is horrible.  Finally at lunchtime I was able to find some Illy.  I was so thrilled that on the way home from work I had to pop the top, just to smell its deliciousness.  When I finally got home and pulled myself a shot, I was in heaven.<br /><br />It's like an addiction, a craving.  And in 6 months of searching since I got my espresso machine, I haven't found better nationally available coffee.

review/summary: Nonpareil
review/text: I've been brewing espresso at home for over 25 years, and have tried just about everything (including lugging suitcases full of coffee from Italy).  This coffee is indeed superior to everything else.  What's interesting is that the coffee is ground perfectly for espresso machines, so I'm saved the chore and mess of grinding my own. For some reason, the chief competitor, Lavazza, although selling decent coffee, for less than half the price, does not grind it optimally, forcing me to buy their beans and grind them myself.  Illy is expensive, at least double the runner-up. But then you could argue, that 45 cents a cup, instead of 20 cents, amounts to less than a dollar per day difference (assuming 4 cups per day), an amount you could afford spoiling yourself. Unfortunately, Amazon's price is even higher than our local supermarkets (Safeway, Giant, etc) where it's sold for $12.99 a can.  You could save 15% by subscribing, but then you could stock up locally when it's on sale.

review/summary: The perfect cup of espresso to jump start your day ...
review/text: After purchasing a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001KO9S8">Gaggia 16103 Evolution Espresso Machine, Silver</a> several years ago, I started hunting for the perfect Italian espresso roast. One of my first (and favorite) blends was the Illy Fine Grind Dark Roast. Imported from Italy, Illy is available in whole beans, drip grind (for regular coffeemakers), espresso grind, and pods.<br /><br />When I took the Illy for a test drive, it produced an espresso with an assertive crema, something that cheaper brands such as Alessi and Lavazza did not. The beans themselves are roasted to perfection, with a caramel-like odor and nuance of flavor that I've yet to match in cheaper blends. I don't consume espresso straight, but instead whip up divine lattes using Illy Fine Grind Dark Roast as the base, although the Illy has so many rich notes, it would probably be great solo. I live in a large metro area, so there are numerous stores that carry Illy, but if you live in a small town, you may have to mail order yours.<br /><br />Another plus is the fact that it comes in an airtight tin perfect for storing in the freezer (as ground coffee tends to go stale quickly). Yes, this is expensive, but still cheaper than purchasing a burr grinder to grind my own espresso beans (when I pondered buying whole Illy beans and priced a burr grinder, my estimates were between $150-400). Illy also makes a fabulous decaf blend in dark roast (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007M3E86">ILLY Ground Decaf Coffee 00493</a>) that runs several dollars more, but is perfect for those late-night espresso indulgences. If you're thinking that it's too expensive, consider that a venti latte at Starbucks will set you back about $5 for ONE coffee, versus at least a dozen from a can of really great Italian coffee.

review/summary: Probably the best between commercial ones
review/text: I want to review this product because I think there are some misunderstanding on what you should expect from it. First thing: Illy is one of the most appreciated brands in Italy, between those you find in supermarket shelves. Definitely not THE BEST, since in my country you can easily have imported beans roasted and ground at the moment.<br />Second: It is NOT for use in auto dripping machines. The type of grinding is too thin. American coffee is made with coarse grind. This is to be used with espresso machines, or "caffettiera", amongst which Bialetti is the best brand, or pressure steam machines, those you find at the coffe shops.<br />Third: to all of you who say "it's bitter": just put sugar in it, in Italy we put sugar in espresso. If you don't use sugar it is SUPPOSED to be bitter. To all of you who say it doesn't give you the "caffeine shot": that's not what espresso is for. If you need caffeine and need to wake up drink one of those energy drinks you can find at every store across the USA. Or just take some day off, sleep more and work less, like we do in Italy. Espresso is something small and enjoyable that makes your life a little better. Therefore it has to be good. It's part of our culture to enjoy the small things and try to live happier.

review/summary: Italy in our kitchen
review/text: After a wonderful trip to Italy last summer, my husband and I wanted to continue having a cup of cappuccino in the afternoon. After a few experiments with some awful tasting coffees, we finally found Illy fine grind dark roast and it is perfect.It's delicious. It's an afternoon in Rome. I think I could eat the grounds by themselves! We have gotten a few friends hooked on it also and now give it as gifts. It's more expensive than what you'll find in a grocery store, but definitely worth the price, and definitely less expensive than returning to Rome every afternoon for a great cup of cappuccino.

review/text: I bought this at my local grocery store to use in my new Mr. Coffee espresso machine.<br />I'm a big coffee nut, I even roast my own coffee. I have a grinder, but at the moment it's about 400 miles away from me :P So I had to settle with this. And to be honest, it's pretty tasty! MUCH better than starsucks' best freshly ground stuff! (tells you how bad SB really is, worst coffee in the universe) But compared to my own stuff, illy coffee is downright nasty! Yes, freshly roasted, freshly ground coffee is that good!<br />But if you have nothing else available, or you don't want to buy a grinder, this is the best pre-ground, canned coffee money can buy!<br /><br />I can find it in my local grocery store for a lot cheaper than here. Under 12 bucks at the San Antonio based Texas grocery chain.

The two-pack and auto-delivery ensures I won't run out even if I don't make it to the store. The coffee is a rich, dark roast (for some reason, harder to find than medium roast--seems strange for espresso) and has the best flavor of the Italian imports I've tried.

review/text: I admit to being old fashioned. My espresso maker is a Krups Il Caffe Duomo. It's a great little machine and it makes great espresso. I have tried at least 6 different kinds of espresso from the national brand where the baristas wear green aprons to most of the others. I settled on Illy because it was the first espresso made, back in the day, and it comes from Italy. The grind is very fine so you will need a basket that can hold fine espresso. If you are familiar with a burr coffee grinder, I will bet that this coffee is ground on a setting of 1.<br /><br />Don't talk to me about pods. Illy makes them but I like this espresso in the can. When you pop the lid, close your eyes and the aroma will take you to a bar in Italy. When you drink the resulting brew, it will have the same effect. It is the real deal and I buy it all the time.

It's a little more expensive than the coffee I regularly buy . The $$ spent for 2 8.8 oz. tins of Illy will buy about 2 LBS. of the other coffee I use. Illy is a luxury I won't give up soon.

I feel immediately better, it is my madeleine de Proust. Illy makes me feel as I were back home.<br />There are wonderful, rare and precious coffees on this planet; but for exactly the same reasons, these beans are also very expensive. Let's think for instance of the Kopi Luwak alias Kafe laku alias Kape alamid (depending on the country that produces it), the Bourbon, or the Blue Mountain etc. Ok, sure they are great coffees if you can afford them.<br />Even if we cannot compare what cannot be compared, Illy is a coffee company which makes fantastic AND affordable coffees. I like the dark ground espresso one because in Europe and especially in Italy we love strong coffee. Plus, I have no grinder. I like the foam on the top and the trace it leaves in my cup once I emptied it. And what to say about its fantastic color and smell? Illy coffee is a very good investment, above all if you love coffee and do not want to spend that much.

review/text: I have always loved Illy, and bought two cans at Christmas for delivery with a bunch of other Amazon orders.  I did it purely for the convenience of not having to pick up coffee to take to my holiday destination.<br /><br />However, I was disappointed:  one of the cans had a broken vacuum seal (all Illy cans are vacuum sealed).  Ergo, the coffee was not fresh; and since I couldn't be sure how non-fresh, I tossed it.  The other can was fine.<br /><br />I imagine Amazon would have honored a return, but it's not worth the time on a simple can of coffee.<br /><br />So I must reluctantly recommend you do not buy this product online, since there seem to be quality-control issues and returning to the vendor in that context is a net loss.<br /><br />The coffee itself, though, is very excellent, and I've been a loyal Illy customer for over 10 years.  This is the first vacuum-seal issue I've ever encountered.

It was nice enough, but it wasn't great. It wasn't special. It's just coffee.<br /><br />It does come in a nice tin though, so I took the empties and refilled them with fare trade shade grown coffee. It tastes just as good, to me, and I don't have to worry about the cost of having a few cups of coffee any more.<br /><br />I'm sure there are some people out there who are convinced that this stuff is worth the price. But not for me.<br /><br />If the tins hadn't been reusable I'd have given the coffee a 2 for being overpriced and no better than other competing quality coffees.

review/text: It is possible to have indulgent stuff without refined sugars.  Classic Fudge is the least sweet of the fudge flavors (according to Wax Orchards) and has a rich, creamy chocolate taste.  The consistency is very much like conventional hot fudge and it takes just 15 seconds to heat a tablespoon in the microwave for pouring or drizzling.<br /><br />I can taste the pineapple juice in this but I like it.  If you want something that doesn't taste like it was sweetened with fruit then this may not be the best match.  I usually warm a tablespoon and toss with a sliced banana and unsweetened coconut.  Delicious!<br /><br />I buy Wax Orchards Classic Fudge at the local natural foods store for about half of the Amazon price.  If you are interested, it's worth shopping around.

We have used them in some of our recipes in The Collard Patch. We buy these often and keep them handy. As grocery prices continue to grow, we are careful to give ourselves little treats like these raisins, which we consider a gourmet product -- actually fit for royalty -- to keep us content with our frugal way of life.<br /><br />Nutritionally they are an excellent source of dietary fiber, energy, and potassium.<br /><br />In 2007, we bought a box of Sun Maid California Golden Raisins that did not measure up to our standards.  Although the raisins were tasty, the box had about 20% dark raisins.  We wrote the Sun Maid Company and expressed our disappointment.  Evidently this occurrence was something they did not expect or accept.  They told us that there is no way to avoid having a few dark raisins in the box but that this box was not representative of their fine product.  And here is the wonderful part of the story:  They sent us coupons for three free boxes of raisins to make things right!  Where could you find a better deal than that?  The Sun Maid people stand behind their product.

review/text: Sun Maid yellow golden raisins are the best brand of yellow raisins on your grocer's shelf--period. These raisins are rather healthy for you. There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too.<br /><br />However, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They are relatively high in sugar (29 grams per 1/4 cup) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that.<br /><br />However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these raisins are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, the raisins do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily.<br /><br />These golden raisins are better than regular raisins if you wish to use a recipe that calls for cooking with raisins. These can come in handy!<br /><br />Note: There should be an expiration date printed on the bottom of the container. Eat or use these raisins before the expiration date so you get them while they're nice and fresh!<br /><br />These raisins are great for persons everywhere who prefer to feed their children fruits as a substitute for candy. They are perfect for people who want to sweeten their food with something 100% natural, too. Raisins provide us all with a healthy snack; and that's a huge plus.<br /><br />Highly recommended--to life!

review/summary: Great price for golden raisins
review/text: These raisins are very fresh and mild tasting. Besides mixing them in with my cottage cheese, I'm going to try the gin and raisin recipe for arthritis. Of course, they will be good in baked goods, too. All in all, I'm very pleased and the price is terrific.

review/summary: Great raisins!
review/text: These golden raisins (Sultanas) taste great. There are a few dark raisins, but not many. These are the perfect golden raisins to use for the Gin and Golden Raisin arthritis "cure" that some books mention. That's one of the main reasons I bought these--they soak up the expensive gin just right.

review/summary: Great Raisins
review/text: Truly fresher raisins that the ones I was purchase in my local store. I was ordering raisins from another vendor but switched to Sun Maid brand because I could get scheduled delivery. I'm concerned that over night Sun Maid's price increased almost $2.00 per order. At that price increase I might return to my other vendor and forget about the inconvenience of placing a order every 3 or 4 months.

review/summary: golden raisins
review/text: I use these raisins in baking. I find it difficult to find them at the supermarket.<br />They aren't popular so even our best supermarket doesn't stock them.<br />However, for delicate coffeecakes, breads, salads, slaws or even oatmeal when<br />you want the sweetness of raisins<br />but not the dark color, golden raisins are a good choice.<br />I soak them to plump them either in warm water or in rum or brandy depending on what i'm making.<br />I had them recently with pine nuts and sauteed kale at a local restaurant.<br />This was very good.The golden raisins compliment the slight bitterness of the kale.<br />The subscribe and save price is very good.<br />I have them delivered every three months.

review/summary: Sweet, good tasting, not great
review/text: Good tasting, great snack. All the stuff that everyone else says, but this isn't like overly good. Just like any other brand of sun-maid. It is a little wet to my liking. This wetness is just because the raisins aren't fully dried but still have some moisture inside of them. If you eaten great raisins grown and dried by hand, you'll realize this isn't the best. However, you ain't going to find those anywhere without personally going out to search so until then, this is a good substitute.

review/summary: golden raisins so much better than normal raisins!
review/text: I've been eating golden (bleached) raisins with my daily bowl of oatmeal for breakfast (along with a tablespoon of wheat germ and wheat bran) for 30 years. Have never tried another brand than Sunmaid- very rarely seen another brand. The taste of golden raisins is quite different than unbleached raisins- lighter and fruitier. They're more expensive, but not much. Amazon has them quite a bit cheaper than the grocery stores, and I believe the 15ox boxes are an ounce or 2 more than the grocers.<br />Never had a single complaint with Sunmaid's raisins in all these years.<br />Great as a take-along snack too.

review/summary: A little old
review/text: I received raisins that had a best if sold by date of only a couple of months out.  The raisins were hard and dry.  I usually get the golden because they are soft and moist.  But these were not.
