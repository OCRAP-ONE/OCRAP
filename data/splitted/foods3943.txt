review/summary: Great taste
review/text: I just made myself a cup of this coffee and I think I found a new favorite brand. When I opened the bag I noticed the pleasant vanilla aroma which wasn't too sweet and overpowering like other brands. I used my french press to brew the coffee which I wouldn't recommend. The grounds are extra fine and the filter doesn't completely seperate the liquid from the grounds. I mixed the finished cup of coffee with some milk and it tasted just like flavored vanilla coffee but without the syrup or sugar. I really liked the taste it was mild but without any traces of bitterness. Definitely a good alternative to my usual starbucks coffee.

review/summary: Decent Flavor
review/text: I love Melitta products and have reviewed two other flavors in the Caf&eacute; Collection.  This time I chose French vanilla.<br /><br />I admit to being a coffee snob.  My coffee must be perfectly brewed and strong, so I use the almost antique ceramic Melitta filter and make it one cup at a time<br /><br />Surprise, surprise!  The Parisian Vanilla flavor is richer and much better tasting than the Creme Brulee which seemed artificial. While the grind is a little coarser than I normally use in a Melitta filter and the coffee color a lighter brown than my Black Magic beans, I found it made a decent-actually good-cup of coffee.<br /><br />Yes, I prefer a stronger, darker brew, but if medium-strength good coffee with flavor is your bag, this is the one to try. I recommend at least two heaping scoops (regular coffee scoop) per 8-ounce cup.<br /><br />One and one half thumbs up.

review/summary: Full Bodied Coffee
review/text: Melitta is a well-known name in coffee in the European tradition.  It is known for dark roasted, full bodied coffees and this is part of their new line.  The flavor doesn't disappoint.  It is strong without being bitter.  I drink my coffee black and the Parisian Vanilla has enough depth of flavor to be satisfying all on its own.

review/summary: Good, basic flavoed coffee
review/text: The vanilla flavor is there but not overpowering. I use cream and sugar with my coffee and the combination works well, which isn't true of all flavored coffees. With h&h and sugar the taste is very smooth and "polite". But it's decent black as well. There's no sweetness (sometimes a problem with vanilla and hazelnut flavoring, and the result can be cloying.) It doesn't seem to provide a massive caffeine jolt; morning java addicts beware.<br /><br />The only negative is the bag, which is so firmly sealed shut that pulling it open is barely an option and would probably result in a mess. It's best to cut it open and store the coffee in something more manageable.

review/summary: Beware the stench-laden nonsense.
review/text: Do you enjoy a well-roasted bean, neatly packaged for ease of optimal enjoyment?<br />This is not for you.<br />Have guests with cheap taste, less interested in Blue Bottle than impressed by things posed as European-ish?<br />This product ain't gonna solve that problem. In fact, its not likely to satisfy any need or want or whim.<br /> This is only barely passable as coffee.  It smells like flavor crystals, tastes like %#**, and unless you're like me and throw away the remainder after three whole investigative cups-worth, will put a stench on your storage vessel of choice.  The bag is crappy plastic + a weensy hint of mylar, with slippery not-tape: unresealable.<br />Which turned out, in my case, to be as fine as the 1/3 fulfillment, noted neither in the offer nor the box: I got one bag, despite the '3 bags' labels everywhere. The total snoot in me wishes they hadn't even manufactured 3 bags of this heavily perfumed reddish-tan dreck, and kind of thinks Melita owes my brewing-rig a bottle or three of vinegar.

review/summary: A fine treat for yourself and your guests
review/text: My bag of Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee has been a pleasant treat these past few days.  The coffee's strength and complexity sits somewhere between a "normal" cup of coffee (the kind you might get at Dunkin Donuts, for instance, or brew from your supply of canned supermarket coffee) and more rich and complex "coffee house" style coffees.  In other words, this is great when you want a basic cup of coffee, but still with a hint of something extra.  Actually, you get two "something-extra" hints here: a shade more complexity than regular coffee, and the vanilla flavor.<br /><br />It's sometimes said that one should avoid flavored coffees because their manufacturers often use the flavor to cover up lesser-tier beans.  I don't think that's the case here.  The vanilla is (happily) subtle to begin with, but regardless, it's pretty apparent that the coffee itself is of high quality.  It's rich and flavorful, with a burnished, non-acidic finish.<br /><br />And just to be clear, it's not a sweetened vanilla flavor that's used here, just a subtle undercurrent that slightly enhances your coffee experience.  You can add your own sweetener if you want a sweet vanilla taste.  Myself, I just add a little half-and-half and I'm happy.<br /><br />If you like flavored coffees on a regular or semi-regular basis (I'm more in the latter camp), this is a fine product to pick up and add to your cupboard.  Even if you like a flavored coffee only occasionally, you may use this up faster than you think.

review/summary: Ooh La La!
review/text: This may be the best-tasting flavored coffee I've ever had.  Most flavored coffees are too sweet for me - especially hazelnut flavors - so I have to cut them with plain coffee.  Others have so little flavor that I have to add milk or sugar to coax it out.  But I tested this one straight up and unaltered, so I could write an honest review, and it's a home run!  (I have a Krups drip coffeemaker, if that makes any difference to anyone.)  My husband and I both take our coffee black, and we sucked down the whole pot in minutes.  Perfect balance of vanilla and coffee flavor.  Yum!!

review/summary: Now This Is Good Coffee!
review/text: I knew the moment I opened the pouch, smelled the aroma and got that body tremor that this was going to be really good coffee. And it is. Very smooth, even though I like my coffee strong, with no bitter or acidic taste. I would say it leans more towards the fruit side of coffee then the wood side. The vanilla adds a nice touch and is not over-powering. If you like Maxwell House coffee then try this coffee (because Maxwell House is terrible). Also Melitta doesn't leave your breath smelling like you've been chewing on an old gym sock (not that I've ever done that). Find out what real coffee is supposed to taste like. It's also a good price for quality coffee.<br /><br />Note: As you can see above I received this coffee through the Amazon Vine program. I am however still being truthful. If I didn't like this Melitta coffee I would have said so.<br /><br />I wonder what FBI Special Agent Patrick Bowers would think of this coffee.

review/summary: A Cup Of Heaven
review/text: As a died in the wool coffee drinker, I regularly consume 3 to 5 cups a day.  (Yeah, yeah, I know too much caffeine is bad for you.)  Luckily, my employer provides my morning fuel at no cost to me, even if it is just plain old Folger's.  So it is particularly noticeable to me when I drink a coffee that is flavored or of another brand.  Well this Melitta Cafe coffee happens to be both.<br /><br />Upon opening the bag I smelled a smooth and creamy scent of Vanilla along with the pleasant aroma of fresh, rich coffee grounds.  I knew I was in for a good cup of coffee because there was nothing bitter or acrid about the smell of the grounds.  You make enough pots of coffee and you can just tell.  So Melitta passed the grounds whiff test.<br /><br />But the real measure of any coffee is the aroma and flavor after brewing, right?  Just as a point of reference, I drink my coffee black and on the strong side of medium.  The Melitta Vanilla is nothing but a pleasure to drink.  It is a smooth coffee without a hint of the harshness or bitterness that comes from lesser coffees.  Thankfully, the vanilla flavor is pleasant without being overpowering or obnoxious.  You still know you're drinking a cup of coffee.  While I am a traditionalist in the sense that I prefer a straight unflavored coffee for my everyday consumption, this is a nice treat and welcome change of pace.  Great for company or just something different from the ordinary.

The first time I tasted it I had to ask my guest to repeat what he was talking about because I was completely "lost" in the sweetness, fruitiness, delicateness of this wonderful oil. I would dearly recommend you try also the Taibi Nocellara extra vergin olive oil at the same time. They are siblings, they both come from Sicily and they are so different! The Nocellara with his strong erupting personality is volcanic.<br />The Biancolilla, like its name,  is a beautiful poem.

review/summary: Excellent single source cold pressed EVOO
review/text: I've tried a lot of high-end olive oils and Monocultivar Biancolilla is near the top of my list.  This oil has a true pedigree because it comes from a single Sicilian organic farm and is cold-processed which differentiates it from other olive oils.  Most other olive oils are blends consisting of cheaper tasteless oils from places like Spain or Portugal.<br /><br />Store brand oils are virtually tasteless but are fine for cooking.  Others disagree and would use this liquid gold in everything.  They're probably the same people who cook with $50 bottles of wine. Olive oil in general is not so great for frying since it has a low smoke point and burns easily. Extra virgin olive oil smokes/burns at even a lower temperature. In other words, this is an oil best used cold. It's great for dipping bread, salads and as a finishing oil on soups or vegetables.<br /><br />This oil has a little bite and is packed with flavor.  It compliments, as oposed to overpowers, your food.  I recommend it without reservation.<br /><br />The farm where this oil comes from is relatively small and produces under 10,000 liter of oil/year.  This accounts for the high price.  If you want a less expensive oil that is almost as good try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000D9N4Q">Olio Carli Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 500ml Bottle (0.5 liter) by [...</a>].  A quick web search and you can find 3 liters for thirty dollars and free shipping.  I can't post the link but if you find their website add a slash offer to the address.<br /><br />One last thing: Extra virgin olive oil by definition has to contain a minimum percentage of EVOO.  The rest is just regular olive oil.  Monocultivar Biancolilla use a much higher percentage of EVOO than is required resulting in a superior product.  Keep in mind that Italy produces twice the amount of olive oil than they have trees for because they import and package cheaper oils -- technically they are Made in Italy.

review/text: Taibi Biancolila is absolutely a world class olive oil.  There is no doubt that the competition is stiff, but this small operation in Sicily deserves to be noticed.  I have somewhat systematically taste tested olive oils throughout Italy (mostly in Tuscay and in Sicily) through many years and this really does rank amoung the best.  Considering it is such a small farm, we are lucky to be getting here in the states.

This ever strong light forces us to squint and focus our sights on what is at-hand; what is on the plate and consequently taste is sought after like shade in mid-day.

review/text: The expensive Silver Needles White Tea comes from the Fujian region of China and has a very light and kind of grassy flavor.  If that's what you're looking for, this Tao of Tea product is not that.  According to the label it comes from the Hunan region of China and has a "roasted chestnut and wild honey aroma".  It costs less but the taste is definitely different.  If you've acquired a taste for the light/grassy flavor of Fujian White Tea, have a look at several other vendors that do carry that.<br /><br />If your drinking White tea mainly for health reasons, I don't know if one is any better than the other.  The flavor of this tea is nice and its organic so I'll continue to buy it, not as a replacement but as a supplement to the Fujian variety.

review/text: I had heard that white tea is the best in the world and the best for the body. This tea has a light delicate taste that doesn't taste like any other tea I've ever had. I liked it very much and would recommend it to any tea lover.  The only drawback was it's price, but the best never is cheap.

review/summary: A lifesaving decaf, truly!!
review/text: I am a HUGE espresso drinker (stove top espresso pot); my love for deep, rich, dark espresso knows no bounds (I drink it straight, without milk or sugar).  Sadly, I was given stern orders to cut my caffeine in half by my doctor:(  What to do?!?  I have never found a good, enjoyable or even drinkable decaf bean that I could make espresso out of.  Jeremiah's Pick SAVED THE DAY!!!  This coffee is as rich, deep and dark as any roast for espresso I have ever come across. I opened my first bag, and the smell and shine to the beans let me know that I had found a truly different decaf. I cannot tell the difference between these beans and my caffeinated beans AT ALL, and I am finding myself indulging in a pot of decaf espresso in the afternoons now that the weather is turning cold, something I would never have allowed myself to do with caffeinated beans.  THANK YOU AMAZON!!  PLEASE DON"T STOP CARRYING THIS COFFEE!!!!

review/text: This coffee is so good that my husband who usually only drinks regular coffee (we brew two different small pots of coffee every morning) actually was looking for it. I served it to company last night and a diehard regular coffee drinker asked me for the name of the coffee I served when I said it was decaf. Best of all, they use the Swiss water process rather than the chemicals many other coffee companies use to make decaf. It's the best--try it.

review/text: Wow. I don't usually write reviews, but these are some great beans at a reasonable price!<br />They truly live up to their description as "round and robust" and have become my favorite decaf. Put in a nice burr grinder and brew with 1:1 scoop/6oz cup water- they definitely hold their own. I'll be subscribing...<br /><br />Update:  2012-  wish I could still afford these beans, but they have nearly doubled in price over the past year or two... my second choice has been the Jeremiah's French Roast.  Solid, but not as complex.

review/text: It's not bad coffee, but it certainly isn't my favorite.  I took a chance after reading the reviews, but I wasn't that impressed.  I grind my own coffee daily on (bordering) an espresso grind and run it through my keurig.  It has a clean taste, but not bold, deep and dark as I was expecting.  It actually has a light-medium body/taste.  I'm really choosy about my coffee though...  I like a smooth, buttery, heavy cup with strong hints of cocoa.  If you go to coffeereview.com, Jeremiah's pick wasn't rated among the highest.  My fave organic coffee that I have tried so far is Counter Culture.  It blows this one out of water!

They were in pieces and crumbling.  In addition the beans were of lower quality, because they were very small.  Eventhough we grind these beans to make our coffee, we want to start with a high quality whole bean that holds those flavors that we seek.  Unfortunately, 100% Arabica does not mean high quality arabica.

review/summary: We use in Rancilio espresso machine
review/text: It is important to know how your coffee is decaffeinated.  For example, one method is the direct method which uses methylene chloride in the process.  Methylene chloride is also used in paint strippers and degreasers.  This chemical was also banned by the FDA for use in  hairsprays and cosmetics, but is still in use for decaffeinating coffee...hmmm.  Now, I am not an expert on the decaffeination process or the justification for the chemicals continued use, but I encourage you to do your own research and decide accordingly!!  This coffee is not only organic but uses a Swiss water process to decafinate.  I use this coffee in my Rancilio espresso machine, and it makes an excellent cup of coffee.  We found that with most decaf coffees, it is harder to get nice crema.  With this stuff, the golden crema flows nicely:).  It has an excellent flavor, but if you are looking for a super strong dark roast, this may be a little light for you.  This is now our go to daily coffee.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: Jeremiah's Pick water-processed decaf whole bean dark roast is incredibly delicious,  No one ever guesses it's decaf. It's got a full rich flavor that I love. My only caveat is that the beans do not keep their  peak flavor for a full week (I usually go through most of a bag in a work week and go out for coffee on the weekends. Whatever beans are left in the bag on Friday are typically not as good the following Monday); they seem to get dry and lose some brewing strength as as result.  Still, for the exceptional full flavor--so rare in decaf coffees--a bit of loss is well worth it.<br />Just so we're comparing apples to apples: I use a Cuisinart Grind & Brew with thermal carafe, so my beans are ground directly before being brewed.

review/text: I was a little hesitant to purchase this coffee, as I am not into flavors- and raisin and chocolate was really raising the red flags for me! After reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot, as many people said you cannot taste the flavoring at all. And they were right! I made it for my mother's birthday last week, served everyone and told them it was regular coffee. Nobody had any idea it was decaf, and everyone complimented the taste. This coffee tastes like a rich but smooth dark roast - I've tried MANY decafs and they all taste like they're missing something (caffeine, perhaps??) and this coffee lacks nothing. It's absolutely perfect. It's rich and velvety -absolutely worth the purchase!

review/summary: Not for me - maybe someone else (too dark roast)
review/text: Honestly, this was the worst tasting coffee I've had in a while.  It had a bitter almost chemical aftertaste that I could not ignore.  It really tasted like it had been sitting under an engine exhaust somewhere,  SO AWFUL we dumped out every pot we brewed.  We normally drink Equal Exchange brand and I thought I would take my chances on this due to the reviews so I could have an evening coffee.  I still gave it two stars because I think any company that goes through the process of keeping their product organic, water processed and remotely fair trade deserves kudos.<br /><br />I think the main reason I didn't like it is because I normally like lighter roasts such as Columbian, and this is a dark roast.  The lighter the roast, the higher the caffeine content.  The darker, the lower the caffeine.  So both my husband and I have stayed with and have refined tastes for the lighter side of coffee when it comes to roasts.  I occassionally like dark roasts so I thought it might be a shoo-in.  Unfortunately, I got six bags of this with high hopes and since then I have been having to give it away to random people hoping they will like it.  Especially those I know that like darker roasts flavor.<br /><br />I am going to try either Equal Exchange's decaf or Jim's Organic "Together" decaf on vitacost next time.  So far, the only decaf I like is the Safeway brand 100% Columbian decaf but we have decided after much research on how coffee is processed that ORGANIC is the only way to go.  We grind our own coffee, use an aeropress, use raw local milk along with rapunzel sugar.  Best coffee in the world!  But this wasn't a good match for our system sadly.

I had no other option so I tried this coffee, but we've been having this ever since! This is the best decaf coffee ever we tried, and most of the time, nobody realize this is a decaf. Very strong, but not sour at all, perfect for dark coffee lover. I really can't tell if it has the flavor of raisin at all, but maybe hint of chocolate. Swiss Water Processed (SWP) coffee is any chemical trace free, cleanest coffee you can have. Frequent coffee drinker always should seek SWP.

review/text: When Starbucks stopped selling their water-processed, bold flavored decaf many months ago, I needed to find a similar product I could enjoy on a regular basis. I'm rather particular about my coffee and I always grind beans at home for each cup. I found Jeremiah's Pick extra dark roast very much to my liking with its mild hints of caramel & chocolate. After ordering a couple of single bags and tinkering a bit with the measure of beans ground for each cup, I came to really enjoy it and began subscribing several months ago. Still love it for my regular big morning cup. While I recognize that coffee preferences are a highly individual matter, I would encourage all who are considering an organic, water-processed decaf to give it a try!

Most all of the stuffing oozes out and leaves a bland (and horribly expensive) chicken breast.<br /><br />Omaha Steaks offers the Chicken Cordon Bleu which is better for both the tastebuds and wallet.

review/summary: I won't buy this again from Amazon
review/text: I've bought Millstone from several grocery stores for several years, and it's always been pretty good.  I ordered two packages from Amazon and both tasted absolutely awful.  No wonder...the "best by" date on both packages of coffee was dated two months prior to my order.<br /><br />I'll still buy dry goods and true unperishable items from Amazon Grocery, but I'll skip things like coffee, nuts and other foods that go bad or degrade in quality after significant storage time.

review/text: Millstone Breafast Blend coffee is the mildest of all the coffees I have tried. I also like high caffeine coffee. Remember: Light roast = high caffeine. Most people think the opposite.<br /><br />Anyway, I like this, and the price is very reasonable. Note: It is NOT for people who like the taste of dark roast coffee.

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: I discovered this brand of coffee when I was attempting to find less expensive ways to use my Keurig brewer (which I no longer have).  The breakfast blend is my favorite.  Both our major grocery chain and Wal-Mart carried it.  The coffee is just exactly what I enjoy.  It is mellow and not too acidic.  I don't like to drink coffee that has been sitting for more than 30 minutes, since almost all of them turn bitter and burned tasting.  Unfortunately, the Millstone coffees became hard to find, so, as always, I turned to Amazon for help.  I now have a monthly subscription service for the coffee.  The price is fantastic and the convenience of getting a monthly supply in the mail is great.  Millstone makes a number of different blends, so if mild and mellow is not your style, they probably have one that is.  "Try it - you'll like it."

review/text: I don't like strong, bitter coffee.

I've tried and enjoyed a few Millstone flavors too, but for some reason I never tried their Breakfast Blend. I'm tired of flavored coffee so I picked up the Breakfast Blend at the grocery store.  I've been alternating between Millstone Breakfast Blend (it's aromatic and mild) & Starbuck Breakfast Blend. Usually I'll buy the least expensive of the two. The current subscribe and save price of $15.06 on the Millstone Breakfast Blend is a great price, & I couldn't find this on the store shelf last week...so I'm ordering from Amazon & saving over $2 a package too.  I can't wait for my first shipment to arrive.

review/summary: Be aware, this contains palm oil.
review/text: The taste is good, it is shelf stable and it does not separate, but the name is somewhat misleading.<br />Most natural peanut butters contain one ingredient- peanuts. Some brands also add a touch of salt as a flavor enhancer. This product contains peanuts, sugar, palm oil, and salt. The palm oil is where I am disappointed. Skippy removes a portion of the peanut oil and replaces it with palm oil. The peanut oil can be sold for a substantial profit, so it is removed during processing and replaced with very inexpensive palm oil.

Skippy has managed to produce a PB with no hydrogenated oils, while having no separation -- and it still tastes great. Try any other brand with no hydrogenated oils and you'll find that they actually don't taste very good, they have all the oil on top, and you have to keep them in the refrigerator. This Skippy product is a very unique peanut butter.<br /><br />She admits it tastes good, yet instead of rating it highly, she only gave it one star because it's kosher. C'mon! Amazon should remove the review.

Now for the Kosher thing, being Kosher is more than just "paying a Rabbi to bless the food."  There are rules for how it is prepared (check out [...] for details).  So, get over that and accept that Skippy took some extra steps, which, in the grand scheme of things, does not drive up the price of a jar of peanut butter!

Both brands are bland and pretty gross, unlike the Skippy Natural Super Chunk, which tastes pretty close to regular chunchy peanut butter. To make it even better I get it cheaper from Amazon delivered then going to the store to get their choices or skippy when they had it.

review/text: This peanut butter is great for the price. We eat a lot of natural peanut butter so when I saw this brand offered here on Amazon I decided to order us some. It taste really good. You don't need to stir it like other natural peanut butters either. However, it does not come in a nice glass jar...you get a plastic one instead. Personally, I do like the crunchy brand a little more than the smooth type because we use it for various African/Southeast Asian recipes (peanut butter soup/peanut butter sauce) in our house and the texture works wonderfully.

review/summary: Sugar does not belong in peanut butter.
review/text: This peanut butter contains added sugar, which is not what I'm looking for in a "natural" peanut butter.  Additionally, they remove some of the peanut oil and replace it with palm oil, which is cheaper and environmentally suspect in its harvesting.  I understand that these are all products that are of a nature-based origin, but adding ingredients to something that is already quite natural (blend your peanuts - you've got peanut butter!) makes it not natural in my eyes.

Trader Joe's)<br />I do wish they didn't add the sugars, but maybe it is in the future for other non-mixing peanut butter brands<br /><br />Sugars in this brand is 3g per 2TBSP(32g) compared to the 16g/TBSP found in other brands, it's really good.<br />Compared to some(very few) with no added sugar, its comparable/reasonable at least...<br /><br />Cal: 190/Cal.f.F 140<br />Sodium: 150mg/TBSP<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Total fat: 16g/3.5sat/0 trans<br />Protein: 7g<br />Sugars: 3g<br />Iron,4%.Niacin,20%.Vitamin E,10%.<br />Calcium, vitamin A, vitamin C: 0%<br /><br />I hated mixing peanut butter that was truly organic, and this is as close as I've found.

If you want cheap/volume natural/ish peanut butter this is as close as you're going to get.<br /><br />Taste is great, I have eaten a jar of this peanut butter with no bread, over a week or two, but nun<br />-the-less,<br /> I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER!!<br />and for MY LOVE,<br />and my need for it to be filled, economically,<br />This is it!!!<br /><br />Benjamin<br /><br />P.S.<br />If I had a better budget and craved peanut butter less, I would go with something more "TOP QUALITY"..<br />but my grocer offers this 26.5oz jar of PB for $3.29, so I'm hooked.<br />...26.5oz. lasts me a week or sometimes less...<br />I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER!!<br />good luck.

review/summary: Top ranked, kid-approved, and simply the best
review/text: I started buying Skippy several years ago after reading a number of consumer reviews that gave it a top ranking. The one that stuck with me the most was a polling of 12 year-olds, who gave Skippy peanut butter a resounding recommendation for its taste and texture. In writing this review, I went back and checked to see what more adult reviewers think. I'm taking the liberty of quoting from the CookingLightly website so far as its review of Super Chunk:<br /><br />"Raters  loved the ultra-smooth butter portion and the pleasantly salty flavor. Besides the abundance of nuts, the peanut aroma and appealing caramel color won us over..Good for baking, ice cream, dessert sauces, satay sauce, or to thicken a winter vegetable stew."<br /><br />This is my opinion, too. I love this peanut butter. I know that Jif and Peter Pan are also often ranked highly, but Skippy is by far my preference.  While I use it on sandwiches, I often just eat a tablespoon or two as a quick snack and source of protein. It is so good in this role that I gave it to a diabetic friend. She uses it in lieu of orange juice if she's starting to feel hypoglycemic. The peanut butter stays with her longer and has a smoother effect.<br /><br />One caveat so far as Super Chunk, though. If you have soft teeth, best to stick with creamy. Otherwise you're taking chances with possible tooth or gum problems because of the bits of nut, which can be very crunchy.<br /><br />While I have often bought the reduced fat versions in the past, some nutritionists are now raising questions abou he value of this approach. They have two basic points:<br /><br />1. The process of removing fat is n fact removing monounsaturated oils which are healthy for us.<br /><br />2. To compensate for any loss of taste, manufacturers are putting back in sugars and oils which may not e so healthy.<br /><br />My rating is based on taste and texture. I'm not taking a position in nutritional debates but do suggest that you check these matters out separately if you are concerned about this kind of issue.

review/text: I usually prefer creamy peanut butter, but this chunky is a nice change from time to time.  It's loaded with little chunks of peanuts.  Great flavor, and all natural.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- No hydrogenated oils added.<br />- No need to stir, even if you haven't used it for awhile.  A small amount of oil will pool, but I don't find any need to really stir it.<br />- Chunks of peanuts are small and plentiful.<br />- Slightly sweet, slightly salty taste and a very fresh peanut flavor.<br />- Spreads well on toast, bread, or whatever.<br />- Can bake with it just fine.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- None!<br /><br />I recommend switching to a natural peanut butter.  Peanut butter can be a great source of protein, but if it's not natural, it's filled with stuff you don't want or need.  This stuff has a great flavor and a smooth texture with crunchy peanuts.

review/summary: Annette Funicello is Right!
review/text: Dennis the Menace, Annette Funicello and Bonnie Blair are right! Skippy Peanut Butter is the best. It has a good nutty flavor and tastes like real roasted peanuts. The Natural Super Chunk is just like the ad says - No Hydrogenated Oil, No Need to Stir, No Preservatives, Colors or Artificial Flavors. It is a good source of Vitamin E which many of us need. According to wiki all Skippy peanut butter is produced in North American plants.

review/summary: Love the taste but...
review/text: I bought this for the low sugar content and reviews that talk about good taste. I understood it has some saturated fat (palm oil) and no trans fat, ok with me. It does taste very good but I did a comparison with Walmart's "Great Value" peanut butter and found some surprises. Wally's has the same sugar content, also has zero trans fat, is slightly lower in calories, is lower in calories from fat and lower in sodium. Tastes very good, sells for a lot less. I'm no nutritionist so I would welcome any reviewer who can tell mw what I'm missing and why I shouldn't go with Wally.

review/summary: The best PB!
review/text: I agree w/another reviewer who said that this peanut butter bridges the gap between Jif-type PB's & the kind you have to stir.  While I personally prefer organic raw almond butter, my husband pretty much hates anything labeled "natural," "organic," etc.  This is a great compromise.  Yes, it contains sugar (only 3g), & yes it contains palm oil, but it does NOT contain preservatives or trans fats!  Plus, Subscribe & Save cuts the price per jar to $2.65!

review/summary: Can not stand "100% all natural" this one rocks!
review/text: I've tried to eat the 100% all natural peanut butter, many diff brands, found only 1 I liked, but then came across this one. Although its not 100% all natural, like most products like that only contain peanuts and maybe salt, this one too me still has few ingredients and no hydrogenated oils.  I don't know how people like the "just peanut" peanut butter, but to each is their own.  I'm huge into organics and all-natural, but just can't like the just peanut taste in peanut butter. I've gone through many jars within the passed 6 months.  The only 100% all natural peanut butter I liked was called Richards, not sure if Amazon sells it, but try that if you like just peanuts as your ingredients. Good luck!

review/summary: Cloying
review/text: Happy I got in on the proverbial party before prices skyrocketed (despite them using a very small ratio of peanuts to filler). Overly sweet, not very peanutty, and certainly not something I'd grab for more than $2/jar.
