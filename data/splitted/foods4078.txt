review/summary: The best gluten-free cookies I have ever had
review/text: I feel like have tried every gluten-free baked good out there. Since I am allergic to dairy, eggs, soy, and bananas as well this product is a lifesaver for when I need a cookie. They taste really , really good and don't make me sick.  I love these things I pray they never stop making them.

review/summary: Vanilla wafers -- beware they can melt in shipment!!!
review/text: These tasty chocolate coated wafers are a great way to get a chocolate fix without too many calories. Be warned however that if the weather is sunny and in the 70's or higher, you're likely to be disappointed when you open the box because the chocolate melts. You'll have three solid blocks instead of 18 wafers, even if you used next day delivery. Best to order this product when cloudy weather is forecast, and high temps will be in the 60's or less -- apparently those brown UPS trucks get pretty warm in the sun!

review/text: I got these for my daughter who has celiac.  I usually can tolerate the gluten free foods, but rarely do I find something that I would choose to eat.  These go beyond that.  They are so good.  Now, I LOVE sugar wafers and so I was skeptical.  But, you'll not be disappointed.  The biggest problem was stopping myself from eating them and saving them for my daughter.

review/summary: Chocolate Vanilla Glutino Wafers
review/text: These are the best gluten-free cookies that I have ever tasted.  They are as good as the regular wafer cookies (or better!).  The only problem is that in shipment (during the summer months) the chocolate all sticks to the paper and the container that the cookies are in.  If they could be put on ice packs for shipment, they would get to the customer in much better shape.

review/text: My daughter has a wheat/gluten allergy so we have purchased a large number of gluten free cookies for her, trying to find something to serve as a substitute to real cookies.  Of all the brands and types of cookies, these are her favorite.  I have tried one as well and as far as prepackaged, store bought cookies are concerned, these are great.  The cookie is made up of alternating layers of waffers and chocolate creme and the whole cookie has been dipped in chocolate.  If you like chocolate I think you are going to love these cookies.

I only keep<br />the packet I have open in the freezer.  See what you think.

review/text: Before becoming a Celiac and switching to a gluten free diet, I used to love Trader Joe's Vanilla Joe Joe's. I found these on sale at the Grocery Outlet the other day and decided to give these a try. These were so much better than the Trader Joe's Vanilla Joe Joe's and significantly better than Vanilla Oreo's. Even my gluten eating friends said they were addicting. They are great dipped in hot chocolate, milk or tea but are even better on their own. Will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Great Cookies -- Period
review/text: I've purchased most of the gluten free cookies available on Amazon and in local stores.  These are best of the bunch.  If you like wafer cookies -- they're good whether you can eat gluten or not (I grew up eating cookies with wheat and these compete with any "normal" wafer cookie (I wouldn't go as far as I would with Blue Diamond's Nut-Thin crackers, which I would say are better than regular crackers -- but they are at least as good as most cookies -- if you serve them to friends they won't wince (or even know they are eating gluten free) when they bite into them).  The other Glutino flavors aren't bad either but the chocolate is the best -- I find chocolate tends to help mask the glutin free flour taste in most cookies.<br /><br />I would recommend some caution in shipping them during the summer as you are more likely to recieve a cookie block rather than individual wafers (although the cookie block was pretty tasty too).  Also, an added bonus for anyone shipping to APO or DPO, they will ship to these addresses(again a caution about the heat, especially if you are shipping to Afghanistan during the summer).

I was hesitant at first to but these cause of the price, but they are worth it if you have the craving. I like them frozen/refrigerated the best. I gave them to a GF co-worker and she really liked them too. The only problem I have is once I open one box, I have trouble not finishing the whole thing. oops. I've also tried the vanilla ones, but they are not that good. Buy these!!!

The chocolate version from Glutino is just as good and has a true "chocolatey" taste - something that isn't there with the other gluten-free brands out there.

review/text: This product is very tasty but if you are also lactose intolerant, better forgo the pleasure.  Milk is not listed on the allergy advisory (May contain traces of...) but the ingredients section lists whole milk powder as a component of the chocolate coating.  Otherwise, it's a great product.

review/text: I loved these cookies when I first tried them, but found that in the humidity they will get soggy and gross if left open for too long.  Easily fixed with a Ziploc, but one time I tossed them in the fridge to keep them extra fresh.  That was when I fell IN love with these cookies.  When cold the creamy layers really hold up against the crunchy wafer and make a wonderful combination.  They are truly addicting.  Also, because we keep our entire house allergen free for my boys, these cookies are some that I can confidently serve when entertaining gluten-eating friends.  They often ask where they can get their own!

review/text: I really shouldn't complain:  the world would be a sadder place without these.  They are like gluten-free Kitkats, which is wonderful.<br /><br />However, they also smell like potatoes.  The chocolate covers the potato taste and smell, for the most part, but, it's still a little bit like eating chocolate-covered crispy potatoes.<br /><br />However, as you are probably aware, there are variations in what people can taste and smell.  Personally, I can tell what vodka was made from--potatoes, wheat, whatever--even though it's so finely distilled that there shouldn't be any way to distinguish that.  If you're not super-sensitive to tastes and smells, you probably won't notice the potato at all, in which case, these would be fabulous.

review/summary: It's good junk food.  They also smell like potatoes.
review/text: First, let me say that I love this company.  They have somehow managed, with very difficult flours, to make normal junk food.  (These kinds of cookies are sold in American supermarkets in packages that are three times the size.)<br /><br />The packaging is pretty;  the cookies are crispy, light, and very appealing in your hand.  They are an exact duplicate of the wheat version.  However, once you get them up to your nose, you can smell the potato flour they are made from.<br /><br />Pull them away from your nose, and you have a very pretty cookie.  Bring them back in to your nose, and it's a surreally icky potatoey experience.  Cookies like this shouldn't smell like potato vodka.<br /><br />They do have a chocolate-covered version of this that you can't really smell, because the flour is covered. It's such a sugar rush that you may not care what it tastes like, particularly because it has an excellent chocolate-sugar-bomb wafer cookie texture.<br /><br />Just hold your nose.

review/summary: Beware of Glutino
review/text: My son and I who are both Celiacs loved Glutino wafers in both chocolate and dark chocolate varieties. We were on our 3rd box when I opened one of the bars and went to bite into it. It was the equivalent to biting into some sort of spongy rock. I immediately spit out what chocolate had fallen into my mouth while biting it. The bar itself seemed extremely stale to me. I went ahead and opened the remaining 3 bars in the box and the rest were normal. I also noted on the package that the product is made in Israel then processed in Canada, then sent to USA to be bought. It seems to me like one of the bars I had floated around a facility for quite some time before it was actually packaged and sent. Or worse who knows. I'm glad it was me and not my 3 year old son who bit into it.<br /><br />I tried contacting Glutino about what happened. I tried calling several times as well as sent messages via the internet. But no response. It went from being suspicious to down right scary, what are they hiding and if this is how they treat their costumers- how do they treat their food?<br /><br />Please be forewarned. Going gluten free isn't easy and Glutino is a big brand on the celiac's grocery list but since our incident we avoid Glutino at all costs.

review/text: These are all natural, gluten free, low in fat and calories (130 calories and 3 grams of fat per serving) and they taste great.  Simply put I love everything about these chips.  The only problem with them is that they're definitely addicting and I want to eat them all the time.  I guess it's a good thing they're such a good deal here on Amazon (much cheaper than at my local grocery store).<br /><br />The texture is somewhat similar to a rice cake, except that it's much thinner so it has a better crunch to it.  They taste like salted popcorn minus the annoying hulls and un-popped kernels.

review/text: We discovered these when my husband bought a bag of the Sea Salt flavor at a convenience store. I loved them so I came to Amazon to get a case. This Butter flavor was a few dollars less than the other flavors so I got it.<br />The flavor is divine at first, but I can only eat about 5 chips before my mouth shrivels up from the overpowering saltiness. I did not experience that when eating the Sea Salt flavor.<br />I will probably order PopCorners again, but DEFINITELY NOT the Butter variety. I will stick with the Sea Salt kind.

I've also tried the sea salt flavor and the white cheddar flavor.  Neither of those leave an aftertaste.  My favorite is the white cheddar flavor.

review/summary: My new favorite!
review/text: I've tried all the Popcorner flavors, and for a while I was completely addicted to the cheddar ones, but now the Sea Salt ones are my absolute favorites.<br /><br />They taste very similar to tortilla chips or baked corn chips- but with a slightly airy texture. And the salt is divine- I LOVE salty things, so the extra sprinkle of salt is much appreciated. These are light, airy, healthy snacks that pack the same punch as a treat that wouldn't be as kind to your body. They truly satisfy a craving for crispy and salty snacks without making you feel as if you liked a giant crystal of salt and scorched your mouth (the drawback to eating Fritos...)<br /><br />Here's a tip though- since the salt isn't baked into the chip or coated on with oils, it's best to REALLY shake the bag of Popcorners before eating- that way all the salt that had settled on the bottom of the bag get sprinkled back on the chips.<br /><br />Great everyday treat that satisfies and doesn't make you feel parched and guilty for indulging. My whole family loves them.

It always gets stuck in the teeth or in the back of your throat. Not with Pop Corners, here you can eat and eat and never have anything get stuck or choke you. I love it, and I wish I could keep buying it. Sea Salt is my all time favorite and I try to get it as much as I possible can afford it. Buying by the case made it great, having as much as I want, when I want it, but it can get a bit expensive. But when the time is right I will be buying more to enjoy.

review/summary: The only problem is, after the first bite, you cannot stop.
review/text: I'm never a fan of popcorn. Hate the chewiness, grease and the sugary flavors. But this bag of Popcorners is no typical popcorn. First of all, I purchased it on line, attracted by the packaging of course (one really eat with the eyes!), which jumps out of the usual bright pink or yellow colors you see when it comes to popcorns. Also thinking it might be just an alternation of "baked chips," already quite popular in the market. Even after I received it, I still thought "The wrapping's really lovely. But I'm just gonna try out a bite...".<br /><br />The only problem was, I couldn't stop after the first bite. Who knew something so simple, with only three ingredients for this flavor, could be this sensational? It's crispy yet thick in the texture. The size of each piece is not too big nor too small. The natural scent of corn is just delightful to the palate. Don't need to lick the fingers....I'm completely amazed and will be venturing into the other flavors. This is one snack food I'd be munching out. Ditch the bags of chips at lunch, try this!

If it had been one of the others, I may have never eaten them again. I've tried the Butter (way too salty) and Kettle (too sweet). So, I went back to Sea Salt and stayed there. My favorite thing about them is there are only 3 ingredients all of which you can pronounce.

For example, the calorie count for 1oz of Popcorners is about 120.  The calorie count for 1oz of Kettle Chips is 150.<br /><br />That being said, if you aren't thinking you're eating them for health reasons, they're great and tasty as a snack!  You can buy them at your local Costco too.

review/summary: Popcorn lovers -- you really should try this
review/text: I love popcorn but after trying these, I don't know if I should ever bother popping corn again.  The taste of these is wonderful and I really like the crunchiness of the chip.  Best of all, however, one can have them anytime by simply opening a bag.  While popcorn can be popped, stored and eaten later, good as it is, it is never quite as good as it is freshly-popped.  These taste great however, and I would rank them very close to freshly popped popcorn -- add convenience and crunch and they pull ahead in my eyes.<br />Note that I am really basing my comparison on the Kettlecorn variety so I, perhaps, shouldn't be comparing it to plain popcorn, but I would rate this against regular kettlecorn similarly, and I suspect that the regular popcorn varieties would hold their own.<br /><br />The additional sugar in the Kettlecorn version weighs in at only 3g in a one-ounce serving so despite the great taste, it isn't exactly drenched in sugar.  If you love Kettlecorn or popcorn, you should give PopCorners a try.

The serving sizes are fairly small so one bag doesn't go far.  At only 100 calories per serving it is a great, healthy snack. These have become a staple in our gluten free household.

review/summary: GREAT TREAT!  A bit pricey but worth every penny!!
review/text: These treats are 100% dehydrated salmon with no additives, preservatives, etc.<br /><br />The fillets may be broken up into smaller pieces, making them ideal for training and positive reinforcement.<br /><br />They're highly portable and you can throw them in your pocket without getting grease all over the place as happens with some other treats.<br /><br />I feel great feeding these to my dog since salmon is very nutritious.  Also, wild-caught doesn't have antibiotics and other chemicals that are given to farm-raised fish, plus it's less damaging to the environment.<br /><br />These treats are a bit pricey but worth every penny, especially since you can break up the treats into *many* yummy tidbit-sized pieces.<br /><br />Both you and your dog will love these treats!  Enjoy!!

review/summary: My Siberian Husky loves it
review/text: My Siberian Husky is very picky with food, and can easily get sick from treats, so I bought the small bag to see if she liked it, or get sick, or not, and she loves it, she knows when is training time, or when she does something really good that deserves a reward, because of the sort of strong smell. The only issue I have with it is that this is extremely hard to break in smaller pieces, and if the pieces are too small for the dog, it can be dangerous for the dod, that is the only reason I won't get any more until she is an adult. I wouldn't recommend it for puppies.

review/summary: Awesome treat - for dogs & humans
review/text: We bought a test bag of Grizzly salmon fillets along with a bottle of Grizzly salmon oil.<br /><br />Needless to say, the dog loved both.  The salmon oil was squirted onto her kibble and the fillets were provided as snacks on an ad-hoc basis.<br /><br />What a great idea! Pure, 100% dehydrated salmon - that's the only ingredient you see listed on the package.  Refreshingly simple.<br /><br />Not only does the dog love the fillets, but a human friend actually tried one, more or less on a dare, and just like potato chips, she couldn't stop eating them!<br /><br />So buy a bag for your dog and another for your favorite human friend.  Makes great Christmas gifts all the way around.

review/summary: Dry and boring
review/text: There needs to be a choice for ZERO stars.<br /><br />While the pictures are nice, and their website (www amazingclubs com) specifically bolds the statement that they have the "freshest and most mouth-watering desserts" it is the complete opposite. The first month we received dry brownies that were slightly smashed and crumbling. The second month was a small dry marble bundt cake (no way would it serve 8-12 even if you wanted to) and just now received white chocolate chip cookies that were (you guessed it) dry. Hard to believe that they are getting away with selling a dozen or so average-at-best brownies and a few more cookies for $28 a pop. This is a great racket for them, but hopefully I can post this review in enough places that they won't take anymore people in. Definitely NOT gourmet - do not order this.

review/summary: Yummy brownies
review/text: The gift I received from Amazing Clubs was phenomenal. I got a shipment of dessert brownies and they were delicious. They were packed in a red tin and were kept incredibly fresh. I got two kinds, one seemed to be a coconut brownie and the other double chocolate. The coconut brownie was so fudgey and the coconut spread was prepared perfectly. It matched the fudgeyness of the brownie and had a great flavor. I thought that the double chocolate ones were going to be dry because I waited to eat them, but to my surprise they were just as good as the coconut ones. I received my shipment right on time and in perfect condition. I even called to inquire about when I would receive my gift, and customer service was able to track my order and give me a delivery date, not to mention they explained how my gift would be selected. I would highly recommend the brownies, they make a great gift and for someone looking for new gift ideas, Amazing Clubs is a great resource. Although most of these gifts I would probably take for myself before I could gift them. I cannot wait for my next shipment to see what I get next! Great gifts for a fair price.

review/summary: Disappointing Desserts
review/text: For Christmas, I was given the very generous gift of 6 months of Amazing Clubs "Dessert of the Month."  Overall, I was extremely disappointed in the professionalism of the company, particularly given how much my relative invested in what was truly a thoughtful and unique gift. The company does not provide either nutrition information or, perhaps more importantly, a list of ingredients, for most of their desserts. This can pose a serious risk to individuals with any food allergy.  Upon requesting such information,  I was simply told, and I quote: "We choose not to disclose our vendor's information to keep our clubs exclusive and a continuous surprise for our members." Of the six months of dessert we received, three desserts arrived with issues. We received a mango tart in dry ice that had clearly melted/evaporated. Since I didn't have the list of ingredients, nor any knowledge of how long it had been sitting "unrefrigerated," I had to throw the entire tart out. We received a cheese cake in the same state.  Cookies were shipped, one month, and upon receipt they were dry, and every one was broken and crumbling. This is not to say that every dessert was bad. We got two months of brownies (which were superb) and one month of a coffee cake (which did come with nutrition info/ingredients).  Dessert products aside, the shipments were always on time. While the company offers a wide variety of other clubs to try, given my experience with the Dessert of the Month club, I would be very hesitant to try any of the other options.

review/summary: Look at the ingredients list - this has more sugar by weight than it has almonds
review/text: I am all for nut and grain milks and have been drinking them for 12 years.  I am now looking for a good almond milk but unfortunately this one is not going to be it.  I think that this company's large cartons (half gallon) of organic almond milk have more almonds than sugar, but unfortunately these small cartons seem to not be made of organic almonds, and, more importantly to me, seem to hardly be almond milk at all, but rather water and sugar with some almond flavoring (according to the ingredients list).  Also, they add "other natural flavorings" which I try to avoid because usually that's food-industry-speak for msg and stuff like that, which gives me headaches.  I understand that the company wants to make this drink more palatable to children and to reluctant health-nuts, but I think it's the wrong way to go to put more sugar than almonds in it, and the wrong way to go to add all kinds of "flavoring" when almonds are so beautifully flavored on their own.  I wanted this to be a product I could order from Amazon, but I'll need to keep looking.

review/summary: Nutrition could be better
review/text: As the parent of a 4 year old little boy who is casein intolerant, I wanted to pack him something in his lunch for school that wasn't juice.  Since we have to limit his dairy intake, we are always concerned about making sure he gets enough calcium.  I bought these to pack in his school lunches thinking this would give him another serving of calcium.  Unfortunately I was mistaken, as there is no calcium in this product.  There are many other almond milk brands that are fortified with calcium (Almond Breeze and Silk's almond milk to name two) but at least for now they don't make 8oz sizes.  My son does love the taste, which is why I didn't give it 1 star.

I ordered it.  I had been drinking it for a couple days and enjoying it when I took a gander at the actual nutrition facts and saw that calcium is listed as 0%<br />That's right a big goose egg--like I would go through all this trouble just because I like almond milk!  How frustrating!!!

He loves taking the Pacific Natural Foods Almond Milk cartons to school in his lunch box, and you can't imagine how disappointed I was when the only store near us that carried it stopped.  This delivery service is great, we set it up so that it arrives just as he is finishing the last 4-carton pack, right to the front door.  The other great part is the price per 4-pack ends up being less than what we were paying at the local store.

review/text: I kept wasting the almond milk in the larger container because I do not use that much of it in the time that it needs to be used up to keep it fresh, so I thought I would try this size. It is perfect for me. I mostly use it on granola or in a protein drink.I also live far away from stores and so it is very convenient for me to have amazon ship it on a regular schedule. I love subscribe and save and wish more of my organic foods were on it.
