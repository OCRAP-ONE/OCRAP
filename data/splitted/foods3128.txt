review/summary: Disappointing and why BHT?
review/text: These tasted nothing like the original Rice Krispies.  The texture is the same at least and its a plus they are using brown rice.  I've been trying to eat more natural foods and after discovering they added BHT (a preservative), I won't be buying this ever again.  All these added chemicals can't be good for you!<br /><br />The only positive about this was that it worked well in a recipe and kept it gluten free.

review/summary: Only use for Rice Krispie Treats
review/text: I read some reviews and I think they are going about it wrong.  My favorite part of this cereal was not eating it in a bowl with milk, but by making rice krispie treats.  My son has celiac and we used to pay a fortune for gluten free treats that were awful.  I don't know how this holds up as a cereal with milk, but if you make your own rice krispie treats then these are awesome.

review/summary: Gluten Free - Bringing back the cereal
review/text: It's nice to see a MAJOR company bring back cereal for those of us who are gluten free.<br />My only complaint here is that you need to make sure all air is out when you close up the bag. Our first box went stale overnight because someone didn't make the best seal.<br />So, by all means buy these! But make sure you have a sealed container you can store it in that your kids can either put the lid on themselves, or you'll need to do it for them each time to ensure your krispies stay crisp.

review/text: My daughter gave these a HUGE thumbs up! Her favorite cereal is Rice Krispies, and since being diagnosed with Celiac a year ago, she was unable to eat them. We've tried other brands of krispy rice that were gluten free, mostly brown rice ones, but she didnt like any of them. These she loves. Says they taste just like the regular ones. I cant wait to use them for rice krispy bars, and to bread chicken and pork. PLUS I found them at my local Walmart for $2.98 a box! THANK YOU Kelloggs for making my daugher's favorite gluten free!

review/summary: Nothing at all like the cereal in milk but OK as "Treats"
review/text: Why did they have to use brown rice? Just because I have to eat gluten-free does not always mean I want to eat "healthy". I was so disappointed when I saw that they would not just be altering the originally recipe for this cereal. And, not surprisingly, the taste reflects my initial guess; they taste nothing like the original. However! In good news, they do make very "original" tasting rice krispie treats, once they've cooled down. When they're warm you can still taste the funky flavor but room temperature or chilled and they are just like I remember!

review/text: Used to love Rice Krispies pre-celiac, but that tiny notation of Barley in the malt flavoring took it off our pantry shelf. Now we can have our favorite again...but this version didn't just drop the malt, it added a lot more brown rice grain. Not quite the same taste...close....but not quite as airy and light and "white"! On the plus side, it still does the snap, crackle and pop with a splash of our hemp milk!

review/summary: A big disappointment
review/text: I've been looking forward to having Rice Krispies again ever since I heard Kellogg's was going to make them GF.  Unfortunately, instead of just taking the barley malt out of the regular Rice Krispies and making the cereal GF, like Post did with Fruity and Cocoa Pebbles, Kellogg's decided to waste the money creating a brown rice version of the cereal.  I can't, for the life of me, figure out how this makes business sense, but it must, because it certainly did NOT make sense to my taste buds.<br /><br />Being GF, I'm used to bland, chalky, soggy, or just bad tasting things, but I expected more from Kellogg's.  This cereal does not taste like the original - it isn't nearly as sweet, tastes weird when dry, and gets soggy extremely fast in milk.  The only thing it tastes "normal" is as Rice Krispy Treats.  If you like the natural foods brown rice krispies, then you'll probably like this.  Otherwise, don't bother unless you're hankering for the Treats.

review/summary: For the price...
review/text: ...I would go with something else.  Check the price, this Kellogg's cereal is over $4 a 12-oz box, even at the current Amazon sale price if you have to pay shipping.<br /> I picked up a box at Kroger this week and it was over $4.  Don't necessarily like to see the BHT but I'm not alarmist about it.  As long as we eat GF, my kids and I are certainly healthy enough for a little detox.  My problem: there is nothing about this cereal to justify the high price!  The flavor is just flat - they didn't even substitute the signature malt flavoring with some rice malt syrup.  This has got to be made nearly as cheaply as regular rice krispies - I feel like many companies slap on a "gluten free" label and think that justifies a hefty price.  (Kudos to the Chex brand for NOT doing this.)  I don't buy many convenience foods and I don't allow my kids to eat cereal very often so I will probably only buy these on special occasions when we want Rice Krispies Treats - the real deal, because I haven't found a single "health food" version of crispy rice cereal that has that same crispy (not crunchy,) airy, slightly flattened shape and texture that really make a good crispy treat.

About the only thing it has going for it is that, unlike Better than Milk, it is pure soy with nothing else added.

You can make it to the richness you desire (we prefer ours a bit lighter than the 1/4 cup to 8 oz. ratio), it is perfect for cooking because it is not sweet.  It blends wonderfully by hand with a whisk, the dry mix has a long shelf life in your cupboard, and it is much less expensive than the pre-mixed grocery store brands.  Make sure you mix it a day ahead, and shake the container well before each use.  I love being able to make as much or as little as I need, saving space in my refrigerator.

In my opinion it tastes great with the following recipe:<br /><br />1 heaping tablespoon soy powder<br />1 cup water<br />1 heaping tablespoon sugar or sweetener<br /><br />The ingredients can be multiplied for larger amounts, but it's best to drink it immediately because if you let it sit for hours the ingredients separate which ruins the drink. I add the ingredients in a drink shaker and shake it for about 30 seconds, but a blender works too. That recipe creates a light almost milky drink which is mild and pleasant.<br /><br />This soy powder is also a great non-dairy substitute for cream in coffee. It can be used as a thickener for smoothies, but first try adding small amounts to find what amount is best for you. The soy recipe plus 1 cup white rice and extra sugar (mixed in a blender for 6 seconds) makes a tapioca-like dessert.

review/summary: Best of the Belgian Machine-made Chocolates
review/text: Introduced to Leonidas several years ago, on successive trips to Brussels I returned with the two other, more well-known brands (Godiva and Neuhaus), when I couldn't get to Leonidas before my plane left. My wife advised me that in the future it was Leonidas or nothing.<br /><br />They are machine-made so the price is not bad (as opposed to the hand-made varieties), but they are also made fresh without preservatives so they need to be eaten or refrigerated quickly. In this house, the refrigerator rarely sees the package.<br /><br />They are excellent and a treat you owe yourself.

review/summary: Belgian Favorite
review/text: We have lived in Belgium for 8 of the last 24 months.  There is no question that the cheapest Belgian chocolate is better than anything you can buy in America.  It is tough for us to gag down American chocolate anymore.  They grind the cocoa beans finer and use less fat and less sugar, so it is much better for you. I am diabetic and it does not send my sugars up.<br /><br />Belgians have very strong opinions when it comes to which chocolate is "best".  They don't always agree, but more Belgians said Leonida's was the best than any other single brand we heard.  This is not something you eat. You savor and treasure every piece.  The price is good and you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Best chocolate I've had in many years!
review/text: I had an excellent shopping experience with Leonidas. From my experience, I can assure you that if you ever have any problem, Leonidas will be courteous and considerate in dealing with you. As for the chocolate, my husband and I are very fond of dark chocolate and have tried many brands before. We found Leonidas ideally bittersweet in its taste and also generous in quantity. In fact, the best of all the European brands we've tried in our five years of dating. It's the kind of chocolate that you not only would buy for gifts but would also want to buy and keep for your snack.

review/summary: Dark and Delicious
review/text: If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />If being "in love" gives you a zest for life, then the "I Love You" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection (dark if you order this box):<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's R�verie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

In fact, the item showed up just two days later, ON TIME for her birthday, when I had just paid for standard delivery.  My friend immediately sent me a very excited e-mail thanking me for the present, and said that she loved it.  Thanks, amazon!

review/text: This year we ordered these dark chocolates and also bought a package of dark chocolates from Godiva. The Godiva dark chocolate box is $36 for 10.5 oz. (really, it's on their website). These are the same price for a full pound. And they come from Belgium, where people are very fussy about chocolates, and proud of their chocolates. It is not just the price. The taste difference is amazing. These are the real thing, a pleasure from first to last. We lived in France, where chocolate shops abound, and Leonidas was quite competitive against the artisan shops.

Dark chocolate can be an aquired taste, to know what is good. This dark chocolate is superb! In bars you can tell the crisp fresh break of quailty dark chocolate and the aroma and the taste. These creams just blend their ingredients with the dark chocolate to create an exquisite taste. Bottom line, They don't skimp on the ingredients and as long as they don't, I will continue to buy their products. The packaging is great because it comes gift wrapped already. I would like to see how its made and the people who make it.<br />Cheaper than a ticket to Belgium and always delivered fresh!

review/summary: Average chocolate, strong fillings
review/text: These are definitely "mid-range" chocolates, not quite as good as Godiva or See's. If you're used to low-end chocolates like Fannie May or Russell Stover, you'll probably find these to be very good. However, if you're used to very good chocolates like La Maison du Chocolat, you'll be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />I found the chocolate to have unexceptional flavor and a somewhat waxy texture. The fillings were mostly very sweet or alcoholic, which is a common practice to cover up mediocre chocolate.<br /><br />I guess they're a good value compared to Godiva, although I think See's Candies has an even better value. Don't expect Leonidas to compare to a high-end chocolatier.

review/summary: Pretty good stuff
review/text: Gotta say ... I'm impressed.<br /><br />I never purchased prepared baby food for my children, I made my own ... but my little grandson loves this stuff. I bought the fruit variety and vegetable variety packs for my daughter-in-law and also had the same shipped to me because I care for him while mom and dad are at work. The other fruits and veggies he is ok with but he goes bananas for the bananas.  I am ordering a case of just bananas because he likes it so much. I hope to have the time to start preparing homemade baby food by the time he runs out of what I already have.  If not, I will keep supplementing with Earth's Best brand of baby food.

review/summary: Repulsive!
review/text: These look, smell, and taste vile.  I try each food first before I give it to my baby and have been very happy with all of the Earth's Best varieties we've tried so far. The bananas however are quite disgusting.  It could be the citric acid used, but it smells and tastes like it is spoiled.  I have been feeding fresh banana up to this point, but bought a 12-jar variety pack of fruit which included banana, so I decided to try it today.  So much for saving money by purchasing the variety pack.  I will be throwing away all four jars of the banana.  I will not feed anything to my baby that I wouldn't eat myself.  Like one of the other reviewers said:  do not stock up on this before you try one jar first.  It's just nasty.  I wouldn't give it any stars if that was an option here.<br /><br />Update:  I still won't buy these bananas again, but I wanted to say that I contacted Earth's Best to complain.  They ended up sending me coupons for a dozen free jars of baby food.  So, I just wanted to add that I really am happy with the company.  Just not this particular product.

review/summary: Best. Baby Food. Ever.
review/text: My baby loves that Earth's Best Carrots. And everything else by them.  Their food is of exceptional quality.  I know--because before it goes in my baby's mouth, I try it first.  I hate peas, but the E.B. First Peas are absolutely sensational.  These carrots cannot be beat.  I have compared Earth's Best baby food to Gerbers and Gerbers Organic, and there is simply no comarison.  The Gerbers food--especially the green vegetables--are simply bland and a bit bitter.  I cannot tell you how wonderful (or maybe I'm trying to now!) the E.B. 1st stage baby foods are.  So good, in fact, that I've already stocked up on the variety packs of 2nd stage foods (also conveniently available on Amazon.com for a great price plus the free shipping).  If you love your baby--and I know you do--and you want him to know just how delicious fruits and vegetables can be, BUY THIS STUFF.

review/text: I love all the baby food my baby eats but this tasted horrible.  I think the ascorbic acid in the bananas makes it taste funny.  It's a little bit bitter and doesn't really taste like a fresh mushed up banana.  I'm going to try giving him fresh banana instead.  Don't stock up until you know they love the taste.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: Wanted my daughter to keep organic as much and long as possible so we tried this brand first & this veggie when she started solids.  It smells and looks bright, and from the first spoonfull (it's not so runny it won't stay on a spatula style spoon) she loved it!  This is a veggie she doesn't refuse.<br /><br />She'll eat a jar of this even after a full bottle if I let her!  No side effects noticed and I even tasted it & found it barely sweet and wholesome.<br /><br />This is a great deal and cheaper than in store; arrives bubblewrapped to death and no weird or broken jars so far.

review/summary: citric acid in product
review/text: These do not taste like banana's and are an odd pink shade. I'm sure it's difficult to preserve pureed banana, but citric acid (predominantly found in citrus and berries) makes this food less than ideal to introduce to an infant. Citrus, berries, fish and egg whites are listed by our pediatrician as "wait until they're old enough" foods due to allergies or the irritation they causes some infants.<br /><br />BTW we normally love Earth's Best products.

review/text: we have a 10 month old baby who has been on Earth's Best foods since his 4th month. He loved the stage one foods and likes the stage 2 ones as well.<br /><br />When I tasted the Apples, they are fine but a bit sour and a little more acidic than what I had imagined. However, my son gobbles it up and does not seem to mind the sour taste at all.

review/summary: Our twin 7-month olds love this one - carrots
review/text: I subscribe to the 4 oz. version of this baby food.  Considering price, I think the 4 oz. jars are a better deal.<br /><br />Both our twin babies love this one with carrots as we discovered with the vegetable variety pack.  Other parents have told me their babies like carrots so this one is likely to be a winner.<br /><br />I've tried many Earth's Best baby food in the jars products on my babies.  They like all of them with only a couple exceptions.  I've discovered they're not fond of peas or onions, but I've also discovered that as they get older they will eat more types of foods.  If you get something your baby doesn't like, maybe you can keep it on hand for when your baby is a few months older and try again.<br /><br />Several other varieties of Earth's Best contain carrots.  I think this is to make them sweet so that babies will like them more.<br /><br />The ingredients are simply organic carrots and water.  One 4-ounce jar (not this 2.5 ounce jar) has 40 calories, and daily value: 4% protein, 150% vitamin A and 4% calcium (that's all of it; no iron for example).<br /><br />Compared to other Earth Best varieties, this has very little calories but is very high in vitamin A.  I'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult.

review/text: I really like the glass jars.  As an urban teacher, we use the jars for art classes, but even if we didn't they're more earth friendly than the plastic tubs or bags that other foods come in.  My son LOVES the earth's best carrots.  They're tasty without any of the extras.  I also like the size of the jar.  It's just right to use for two nights of veggie sides.

review/summary: all right by me !!!
review/text: This tea provides a luscious and refreshing break from your daily grind and helps you relax as well. It's got a great cherry apple taste to it that is not overpowering and if you let it steep about three minutes you're bound to enjoy it as much as I do!<br /><br />Each bag contains all-natural ingredients including hibiscus, cinnamon, chamomile, cranberries and apples. There's some vitamin C in it, too. There are no artificial ingredients! The stringless tea bags can easily be removed from your cup whenever you want just by using a spoon or anything similar to get them out of the cup. Stir the tea bag around and up and down a bit while it's in your cup before you drink it. It's also kosher if that matters to you.<br /><br />The tea is also caffeine free, which is a plus for those of us who don't want caffeine in our diets. That is something I always prefer.<br /><br />If you like a cherry apple, very slightly tart flavor to your tea, this is highly recommended! Enjoy!

review/summary: Smells like apple cinnamon, tastes like cherry pie!
review/text: This ruby shaded brew has an appealing cinnamon and apple aroma. The flavor was more like tart cherry than cranberry--maybe that is due to the combination of cranberry and apple. Quite tasty--don't brew too long or it can become sour!<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box: "Genius is the power of of lighting one's own fire." John Foster

review/summary: Not Like Motts Natural Apple Juice
review/text: By subscription, I purchased 8 Mott's natural apple juice 64 oz bottles, at something over $17.00 and these are absolutely delicious and we were drinking several glasses daily.  Just informed by e-mail this is no longer available by subscription and it turns out, not available from Amazon, esp. not subscription at all - now the price is $30.00 plus shipping of around $10.00 from an external vendor.  That's a big increse.<br /><br />So I'm looking for an alternative since we like the more pulpy type apple juice and not the thin cider and I deliberated on the Mott's for Tots although it says it has 40% less sugar, which is OK but I thought I'd buy a bottle locally and try it out before buying a case of 8.  It is just awful - thin juice and has practically no taste.  I'll have to mix it with some other juice to give it some flavor. So -, still looking as I like the delivery of bottles and not having to haul them home.
