review/summary: Better Than High Priced Brand
review/text: After using the high-priced brand of Sucanat, I was a little reluctant to take a chance on this product. I wondered if this would be a case of "getting what you pay for."  Well, NO WORRIES!  This NOW Foods brand Sucanat is actually superior, in my opinion.  In side by side taste, smell and texture comparisons, this product comes out ahead in all ways.  Compared to this NOW Foods Sucanat, the other brand had a slightly "off" taste and smell.  It's hard to describe the difference, but the expensive brand had a bit of a "chemical" taste - at least the two bags that I compared.  Contrary to another review, I found that this product is slightly finer in structure and granular size - very consistent with no clumping in the bag.  The aroma and taste are rich, strongly redolent of regular brown sugar. It dissolves and blends easily.  I can't tolerate refined sugar, and this product works great for me in my favorite banana bread recipe as a brown sugar substitute.  It works much better than my substitution of honey for brown sugar. Being slightly less sweet than regular brown sugar, I do increase the recipe amount by 10 or 15 percent of what is called for as brown sugar. I'm anxious to try to develop a cinammon roll recipe using this Sucanat - what with cinammon rolls being my other favorite baked food - one that I haven't been able to eat for a long time.  This product is a great value, and I plan to reorder several more packages to stock my pantry.

review/summary: Pleased w/ product
review/text: I first bought this, unsure of how I would like it. I have been very pleased w/ it, and have bought more since. It makes a great replacement for sugar in many recipes. It obviously has a different flavor, more molasses-like, and if you're putting it in something such as rice where it's going to melt, it will be brown. I say that because some kids (or adults, lol) don't like it if they're food looks/tastes different than what they're used to. I have quit using refined white sugar and have replaced it in my recipes w/ other things, this being one of the things I periodically use. I have been very happy and pleased w/ this product.

review/summary: Great for Senior Dogs/priced too high
review/text: My dog has always consumed and loved pedigree, but with age she had needed some additonal help. The Healthy Maturity formula has all the nutrition needed for healthy joints which has slowed her down lately. I think this dog food has helped her to get along better than before we started it. Since it is loaded with salmon/fish oil, it has a rather potent smell and has made the dog very 'gassy' if you know what I mean. Of course my kids think it is funnier than anything on TV.<br />As for the price $18.99, that is outrageous. You can get this for under $11 at Walmart and Kmart.

review/summary: My dog loves it, so do the cats
review/text: I bought this dog food after my twelve year old pit/hound mix stopped eating another major brand. He scarfs this up like it was a bowl of beef liver. The food is processed into small pellets about the size of a slightly flattened green pea which mixes thoroughly and easily with canned dog food, a bit of scrambled egg or a splash of chicken broth. However, our pooch seems to like it dry almost as much as mixed with other protein. Even the cats will nibble on any leftover bits during the day. Amazon offers a reasonable price and combined with Prime free shipping this provides a convenient alternative to hauling heavy bags of dog food home from the grocery store.

review/summary: My senior dog looks forward to her meals again.
review/text: One of the problems senior dogs often face is a decreasing appetite. This may be caused by the pain of gum disease or broken teeth, decreased senses of smell or taste, and kibble too hard or too big for older mouths to chew. Pedigree does a great service to our aging canine population by formulating foods that appeal to the older dog; the kibble is easier to chew and appears to have a yummy smell to the dog. My 12 year old chow girl was just not eating and seemed sad. Cham seemed to be on a physical decline. I have used other Pedigree foods for decades and decided to try this senior dog food. She began eating a little more at each meal. Her coat shine has returned and her eyes twinkle once more. She has resumed barking at passing strangers-a sound that I was actually happy to hear again. She is definitely showing the benefits of good nutrition and I hope she will remain in good happy health for several more years.

review/summary: Doggie's Change of Pace
review/text: I've been using Harmony Dry Dog Food for the past 2 years with great success. However, the last bag had a rancid oil smell upon opening. Not sure if the Texas heatwave OR a recipe change was the cause. BUT my pooch ate it, just not with his usual gusto. Making gravies to enhance it pushed me to find some healthy "mix-ins". Searching the internet for reviews and pricing of various brands, led me back to Amazon and Pedigree on sale. I've been mixing this with his Harmony. He eats the combination heartily without digestive issues. Based on his favorable response I've purchased other Pedigree brand items (dry and wet) on sale through Amazon's Warehouse Deals with equally favorable response.  I won't give up on Harmony Dog Foods BUT I'll have other options as well so my fur-baby doesn't burnout on it.

No wonder our pets are suffering so many diseases that could be prevented with proper nutrition. Corn, wheat how this crap is legally sold as dog food or even touted as "wholesome" is beyond me.<br /><br />Want a starter book on the horrors of the pet food industry? "Food Pets Die For", check it out<br /><br />we switched to a more natural kibble several years ago but even then the years of feeding junk food did its damage. Our Dane was diangosed with lymphoma, and since has been switched to raw pet food such as Nature's Variety and Primal. If you love your pet, at least check them out. They are pricey, but for a healthier/longer life, well worth it.

review/summary: Great food, great size!
review/text: I had been feeding our newest adopted pet, a mini chocolate poodle, the chicken soup canned food since we got him last month.  I felt that it was a good food, but he would not eat it unless I "doctored it up" with dry food.  He wouldn't eat the dry food, Natural Balance ultra premium, alone without the canned.  It got to be quite a production because there was enough in the 13 ounce size can of food for 3 days for him when I added the needed dry food.  I did not like having it around that long so I decided to give Pro Plan Selects a try.  When I first started mixing it with his old food, he was picking out the Pro Plan Select first.  I love that this size can is perfect for his daily portion!  He has had the chicken and the turkey and I don't have to add anything to it for him to lick his bowl clean.  SO much easier and it has agreed with his system without complications.

review/text: We have loved this tea for years and my store no longer stocks it. Now I can get it from Amazon. Wish I could buy fewer (comes in pack of 6) but it will keep a long time so it's ok. This is NOT an herb tea, it is a flavored black tea. Try it iced !!

review/summary: My favorite summertime iced tea
review/text: During hot tea weather I generally opt for some of the stronger flavors, but I like my iced tea mellower.  This one has a nice subtle, mellow flavor, and although it makes decent hot tea, I prefer it for iced tea.  I drink my iced tea unsweetened, and as such, I prefer gentler flavored teas for iced than I do for hot tea, so this one works out well.  It's mild, pleasant flavor has just a hint of raspberry and goes great when the weather is warm.

review/summary: The best tea, from the best vendor.
review/text: First, the tea: I only drink iced tea, not hot. I don't like black tea unless it's sweetened. Quite some time ago I discovered a flavored tea - Twining's Four Red Fruits - and, if I brewed it half-and-half with black tea, it made a very pleasant drink that I didn't need to sweeten. Then, Twinings changed the product. They claim that their Mixed Berry is the same, but it's not. I tried a few other flavored teas, and nothing was as good - until I hit upon Bigelow's Raspberry Royale. Love it! Three raspberry bags and three black tea bags (I prefer Tetley's round teabags), steeped for at least half and hour, makes a very refreshing glass of iced tea. My local markets no longer carry the Raspberry Royale, which makes me wonder if Bigelow is getting ready to discontinue it... I'd better stock up!<br /><br />What I really wanted to write about is Amazon.com - they are great! I placed my order late Saturday evening, got a notice today (Sunday) that it has shipped, and expected delivery is tomorrow (Monday)! And the shipping was free with my Amazon Prime membership! I was expecting to have to suffer through another pitcher of icky regular tea, but I will be able to make my Raspberry Royale when I get home from work tomorrow!<br /><br />Amazon.com is the greatest store in the world. Anything I'm thinking of buying, I can be sure to find it here at probably the best price available - and I can read reviews of other buyers first. Love it!

review/summary: The Iced Tea Solution...
review/text: This Raspberry Royale black tea by Bigelow is really quite refreshing, though somewhat weak and sweet, regarding the tea and fruit flavoring, respectively. It is perfectly good straight from the pot, but is probably best when served-up cold. This tea is remarkably free of aftertastes, which lends itself to long steeping times. Just add a light sweetener and a ration of ice, then prepare to chill-out!

review/text: Everyone said green tea was good for me but I never liked the taste.  Now I use one green tea bag and one raspberry tea bag in a large mug and it is delicious.  The raspberry tea has such a good flavor that it masks the green tea flavor but I'm still getting the benefits.  This is a good deal for raspberry tea and the Bigelow is my favorite.

review/summary: Best on a cold winter night with a book
review/text: It's hard to believe that I've been drinking Sleepytime tea for almost 18 years. My parents are avid tea drinkers and started giving my brothers and I sleepytime tea at night when we all turned 8.  Winter nights were spent in front of a fireplace reading a book with a cup of sleepytime tea. No matter where I am, when I have that cup of tea I know I'll sleep great.<br /><br /> It doesn't make me super drowsy, to where I couldn't drive if I needed to, but this tea is what makes the end of my day so worth looking forward to. No matter how crazy the day is, there's a cup of sleepytime at the end of it all and pages from a great book.<br /><br /> This tea is so amazingly tasteful and aromatic, it just SMELLS relaxing.  The sweet smell of "Egyptian chamomile, cool spearmint from the Pacific Northwest, and lively Guatemalan lemongrass" make this tea one of the most amazing tea's I've ever drunk, and makes just about anyone who's ever tried it a lover. From my good friend and her husband, to my own husband (who doesn't drink anything hot but hot coco) and our friends, this tea has been passed down from my parents and will continue to be passed to my children. It's a great tea that becomes a tradition quickly.<br /><br />It's great hot, warm, or cold - and is also available in a "throat tamer" version in the pillow's for the times when you've got a sore throat too!

review/summary: Not only for sleepytime!
review/text: I recently purchased a Keurig and looked around for a nice variety of K-cups, to fill up my pantry and satisfy everyone in the house who enjoys a hot beverage. At the time, my main requirement was no caffeine, so I thought a nice herbal tea would fit the bill. I was pleasantly surprised. The tea is a nice mild mint with some chamomile. It needs no sweetener, is delightful any time of day or night. I wouldn't say it makes me sleepy, but it has a relaxing effect, perfect for anytime you need a little de-stressing time.

review/text: Unless this is a misprint, they are charging almost double plus high postage for the same pod tea you can get elsewhere on the net for much, much less. They are charging approx. $41.95 for 48 pods. Elsewhere the pods cost between $9.95-13.95 for 24 pods, plus $7.49 postage. Most other places also waive postage if you buy more than $50,00 worth but this place doesn't. Either this is a misprint and it's $42.00 for four packages of 25 pods each (96 pods) as it is at the cheapest site I found on the net, or this is a massive ripoff. Hope it's the former.

I recently bought tendons and trachea for them but my 17 years old boy was having hard time enjoying those.. so, I bought these lungs and he can't get enough of it!! It's not hard and it's not really chewy, the texture is fluffy like popcorn! You can easily break them into small pieces, so they are great for big or small dogs. Would recommend for senior babies with hard time chewing treats. It's got a bit of a smell but it disappear fairly quickly and does not stain the carpet. Will definitely buy more!!

review/summary: My little girl sheltie loves a piece of lung for breakfast
review/text: I give my 30 lb sheltie about half a piece of lung every morning for her (first) breakfast.  Breaking them up is kinda weird, the lungs tend to turn to powdery bits when I try to break them, so I guess I'll just have to give her a whole piece of lung from now on, huh? ^_^<br /><br />The smell of these is similar to dried green tripe, quite stinky, but disappears once she's eaten it.  She *LOVES* the smell of the lungs, though I don't, so I hurry up and give it to her and seal up my ziploc again before I smell it too much.  With a light and airy crunch to these beef lungs (the sound of her eating these reminds me of munching on popcorn), they aren't a replacement for rawhide, bones, or other similar long-lasting chews.  It only takes my dog a few minutes to eat hers, but she's a slow, lady-like eater, not a gulper.  There's a lot of lung for 1 lb, I filled 2 gallon-sized Ziplocs with the 1 lb, and they're a great price.  For what they are as treats, they're a great natural product to give to your dog.

They will make them thirsty because they are dry.  No complaints on this product.

Personally, I dont think I would order them again, but would instead go back to the ears or something a little more crunchy. These are basically like 1/4" to 1/2" pieces of skin that have been smoked until cured. Though they are a little crunchy they are more like ummm think of a styrofoam texture.<br /><br />The product was well packaged and I would order from the company again, just would get something different.

I'm ordering more.

review/text: This is my finicky Basenji's favorite treat over the Plato treats & certainly the California Natural biscuits.  In the pet store, this product is priced at $17-$20 per lb.  I was very happy to get it for half that via Amazon.<br /><br />Although... it's still $8/lb.  I realize that it would be cheaper to just buy a steak.<br /><br />Oh well.

review/summary: Not what I hoped for
review/text: I've been trying to find "uncrystalized" candied ginger for ages. Thought I'd give this brand a try.  Was hoping the ginger wouldn't be heavily sugared.  To my dismay, the ginger was drowning in sugar and the ginger itself is not powerful at all.  So, it's just too sweet with not enough ginger to balance it out.  One of those, 'you live and you learn' experiences.

review/text: This is a pretty good candied ginger. I'm not a big fan of ginger, but my husband is, and this hits the spot for die-hard ginger fans. And even though I'm lukewarm on ginger, I admit I enjoy a bite of this from time to time. It's chewy, tender, and has a good flavor. And these folks deliver fast. I've ordered a few times from them already, and the supply comes in so quickly you don't even get time to wonder when your shipment is coming in.

review/summary: Another good product bites the dust?
review/text: This was my favourite brand of cod liver, it's hard to find in Toronto, so I buy a dozen at a time when I find it. However, the last purchase, every one of the cans I opened was very lightly packed, about one third liver and the rest just oil. Even worse, the liver had dark, grey spots that would turn my stomach just looking at them. Perhaps good cod liver has become a thing of the past, like many other delicacies. I would prefer if they just raised the price to whatever it needs to be to provide the quality that we deserve when we spend our hard earned money, or, if that's not possible, just let the fish live and make soyburgers or something.

review/text: It is recommended that you drain the oil which I do not but need to consume it cold. 121 grams = 4.26 oz, OVER and I repeat, OVER 100,000 IU vitamin A (2,000%), 10,000 IU vitamin D (2,500%), 20,000 MG Omega-3, 570 MG cholesterol (190%), 100 g fat (150%)... I have consumed cod liver from Ireland, Latvia, Denmark... It has so much vitamin A that can be considered toxic less alone, fat and cholesterol. Not a strong tasting at all in its own clear oil. I place it in a sealed container and consume a small portion at a time as medicine since (over 8,000) very high in inflammation factor.

review/text: It is inferior to the 10 year old version I have. Pivots in a strange way making it difficult to use (followed poor directions) AND the blade clearance isn't tight enough so it leaves the 'outer shell/skin' of the nail present requiring a file or the use of my old original cutter. Argh.

review/summary: Mmm... Mars bars! :-P~
review/text: I'm guessing you probably already know what a mars bar is, so let's just assume you like 'em. Not a whole lot else to say. If you haven't had an English style mars bar before, I would say that they're one of they're one of the nicer candy bars out there. Well worth trying for anyone who considers themselves a connoisseur of fine junk foods! Do be aware though that judging by some of the other reviews posted, they're NOT quite the same as the mars bars that some buyers may have been expecting.<br /><br />While prices do fluctuate, as of the time of writing this package of 48 will wind up costing you just a fraction over [...] a bar. Amazon does sell these bars in packs of various sizes, but at 48 bars this is the largest package I personally have seen, and offers by far the best value. So if [...] a bar sounds like good value from where you sit (and especially if you qualify for free shipping), this seems as good a place as any to buy your chocolate fix. If not, hey, look elsewhere.<br /><br />I took a star off because... Well, just the obvious. Mars bars are bad for you, duh! So please, enjoy in moderation ;-)<br /><br />Theo.

If I didn't like the taste of coffee so much, I'd ditch it and just do this tea :-)  It's smooth, light, picks you up without any jitters like coffee does to ya; and it soothes my stomach aches.  I absolutely love this.  The seller is very professional, fast in shipping, and reasonably priced.  Thank you so much for selling the Best Tea Ever :-)

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: This was my first mate de coca product, and I didn't quite know what to expect. I had read mixed reviews, and I spent an hour or two looking up the different types of coca tea that MB carries.<br /><br />I eventually decided to go with the Yungas. I'm not sure why, I believe it had some of the more favorable reviews. I opted for the expedited shipping, and it only took a few days to get to the midwest from North Carolina. I opened the package to find an air-tight bag filled with tea bags.<br /><br />First, I tried the tea. I believe a made a couple cups, first using 2 bags, and then 4. The tea was pleasant tasting, but it wasn't that strong. So, I then decided to quid the bags, with a little bit of baking soda. The baking soda is alkaline, and helps aid the absorption of the nutrients and other alkaloids from the tea leaves.<br /><br />I must say, the quid is the way to go! Chewing these leaves gives a very nice energy boost, without the jittery caffeine feeling, and no tired "crash" afterwards. Would I order again?<br /><br />I started with a 50 ct. I'm now awaiting my 2 x 100 ct order. Yes, I'm a fan.

review/summary: Best brewed Green Tea.
review/text: I drank canned and bottled green "tea" before discovering this Lipton variety and I won't spend money on those overly sweetened products now. With the unique pyramid bags, you get a much more flavorful, intense tea WITHOUT added sweeteners. If you must, you can add sugar or honey to taste, but I like the orange flavoring without doctoring it. I also liked Amazon's great price!
