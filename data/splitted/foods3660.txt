review/summary: Cant. Nat. Orange Pound Cake
review/text: If you love chocolate, you will love this cake mix.  It is very moist and chocolatey with a hint of orange. I served it at Christmas and added a chocolate icing to it.  Everyone raved about it, and several asked for the recipe (which of course is a secret family recipe). The mix is simple and the price is fantastic.  I am really glad to have found Canterbury Naturals on Amazon.  I have used many of their mixes, and they are all wonderful.

review/summary: Pound Cake Yes-Brownies No
review/text: I have brought this pound cake to several family gatherings and it always gets rave reviews.  The cake is moist and rich.  A small serving goes a long way. I skip the glaze and serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />However, the brownie recipe is terrible.  Don't waste the mix on the brownies; you will most certainly be disappointed.<br />.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QAA">Canterbury Naturals Chocolate Orange Pound Cake Mix, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Directions are WRONG for the glaze
review/text: My husband and I made one of these Canterbury Naturals Chocolate Orange Pound Cakes last weekend..... I say "we" made it w/my tongue in cheek because these are, indeed, very simple and definitely do not require any help.<br /><br />I was glad my husband was there for making the glaze, however, (so I would have a witness and would not get teased later)...... because I was VERY surprised to see the Orange Glaze recipe:<br /><br />1/2 cup orange juice & 1/2 cup GRANULATED sugar - not confectioner's sugar as I have only ever used in glazes before.<br /><br />I've baked a few things in my life that call for glazes and I've never seen granulated sugar called for in a recipe. Not being a baker by trade I thought there must be something I don't know about this simple concoction......so, w/my husband's encouragement I proceeded to go with the box & not my instincts....<br /><br />Incredulous, we decided to do what the directions called for: combine the o.j. & granulated sugar, simmer for 5 min. over med. heat, let cool 5 min. then pour or brush over top of cooled cake....<br /><br />Just as we suspected, the glaze was a disaster and not only tasted odd but looked even worse - the "glaze" never got to a glaze consistency and just soaked into the (already dense) cake and pooled around the bottom in the sheet pan........lol<br /><br />The cake itself, mind you, was delicious, just as the other reviewers have stated (more so before the soaking of the odd "glaze"). I checked and ALL SIX boxes of the mix that we were shipped have the same directions. I feel CERTAIN that this is a typo and that you are supposed to use 1/2 cup of CONFECTIONER'S SUGAR and NOT granulated....<br /><br />Otherwise, we like the cakes and will continue to bake them..... just a heads up for all you other bakers out there that follow the directions and not your instincts......<br /><br />Cheers,<br />JA

review/text: I am sorry that I purchased SIX boxes of this product.  I made one box and followed the directions for the brownie version.  The finished product was anything but delicious.  The orange taste was on the bitter side and the chocolate cake/brownie was very grainy and crumbly.  The name sounded so good - but it did not live up to it's name and I was very disappointed.  My guests agreed that it just wasn't good.

review/summary: Prompt Delivery & Excellent Packaging
review/text: I looked for a bakery local to my brother to make & deliver a birthday cake to him (he's 2,000mi away).  I couldn't find one near him, so I came online and found this cake by Berries/ProFlowers.  I placed my order on Amazon.com early afternoon on Monday, scheduling delivery for Wednesday.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Delivered on time<br />-Packaged carefully so not to be squished, marked perishable as well<br />-Rich, chocolatey cake (according to my brother)<br />-Pretty cake<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Very pricey for a small cake<br />-Packaging for delivery is great, but my brother said it was also difficult to re-package to be able to save for later - I told him it was a single-serving cake so it shouldn't be an issue :)<br />-No tracking info.  I would've liked to be to track the status of the cake deliver, aside from getting a generic email from Amazon saying Proflowers shipped my order.<br />-The note in the small card delivered to the recipient is stuck on to the card using a post-it note-like paper (kind of cheesy).  For the price, is it really so hard to have it nicely handwritten in the card?  I know it's a small thing, but still.<br /><br />All in all, I think it was a nice thing to do for a special occasion and in a pinch, but at about $50 (w/shipping) for a cake...ouch.

I found the price of this product to be very reasonable; I have ordered from another company at twice the price and was horribly disappointed.  I hate to cook, but love lobster and hate the muss and fuss of live lobster.  I prepared this lobster "lazy woman" style....simmered in butter and reduced, pinch of salt and served on lightly toasted french bread.  My next order will be arriving soon and I will be preparing the same way for my son who is an accomplished chef, after he mows the lawn. :)

review/text: Want to amaze and astound your friends with a seemingly complicated Indian meal? Pick a few Parampara spice mixes such as Chicken Tandoori, Goan Fish Gravy, Chicken Tikka, Vegetable Biryani.<br />The packets tell you what you need to add, usually it's just meat or vegetables, coconut milk or yogurt and water. Follow these easy  instructions and within minutes you will have a lovely dish - and any leftovers are even better!<br />I've experimented and added vegetables to some dishes such as zucchini, onions, eggplant, and I've substituted shrimp for fish with the Goan Fish Gracy and the results were amazing! Shrimp with Goan Fish Gravy turns out like piripiri shrimp.<br />I've even served these dishes to my Indian friends, who were surprised they could be served food this good from an Irish girl.

review/summary: I love this product!
review/text: This is a great paste to use for a fast and easy chicken tikka masala.  Extra tip here if you are planning in advance and have extra time. I marinate chicken pieces in a tandoori powder (bought from an ethnic store or local supermarket) mixed with fresh garlic, natural yogurt, salt and lemon juice.  Refrigerate overnight or 2 - 3 days to allow flavors to infuse the chicken.  Broil the chicken pieces under a hot broiler for 8 - 10 minutes to blacken and add to the simmering sauce made as directed on the packet.  Cook through (about another 10 minutes or so) then add the yogurt, cream and fresh cilantro as directed on the packet at the end. I really think this beats many restaurant versions of this dish hands down!  Tell me if you agree.

review/summary: Best Curry Ever
review/text: If you're an Indian curry lover, this item is for you. It is fairly easy to make, needing just water, yoghurt and butter. The spice mix takes a while to mix into the yoghurt but the effort is well worth it. Also don't take the directions of weight or volume for the yoghurt or water or butter too seriously. If you add too much, chances are you'll have more gravy and might need extra salt. If you add too little, you'll have thicker gravy that you can dilute anytime with water. The flavor is extremely good, very aromatic and buttery and goes very well with Basmati Rice. I also like onion rings with this special curry dish and I find it adds more flavor. Highly recommended for its ease of use and yumminess.

review/summary: Fiji or Hawaiian Springs?
review/text: I adore Fiji water and have been addicted for years.  None of the mainstream bottled water(Nestle, Dasani,etc.) quench my thirst.  The leave my mouth feeling dry and unrefreshed. Talking Rain is okay, it does quench my thirst, but I can't help feeling that someone tipped a spoonful of sugar into the stuff.  I want that clean, crisp feeling I got when I drank well-water at our summer home in Wisconsin when I was a child.  When we arrived, we would dash for the pump handle and give it a go.  The water was so fresh and clean tasting...well... Fiji water is about as close as I've come.  Hawaiian Springs, which I have just tried, is very similar to Fiji. I'm not sure which one resembles that old well-water most, nor can I figure out how water from such geologically different areas can be so much like well water from Kettle-Moraine country.  Go figure!  In any case, if you want great tasting water try Hawaiian Springs or Fiji. It's better than any soft drink on the market.

True, you have to add some ingredients, but that's what gives it that delicious home-cooked taste.  The soup is still very easy to make and believe me, I am no cook.  If I can use this mix and make a great-tasting meal then that says a lot.  These Canterbury soups have changed my life...so far every mix I've tried has resulted in an excellent meal.

If you do not use boiling water, it affects the flavor.  I will be certain to get more of this when I run out.

review/text: What's not to like?  Delicious stuffing in five minutes.  You can prepare as much or as little as you like.  With a neat little trick that I've discovered, you can get a real cooked-in-the-bird flavor, even though you're preparing it on the stove.  All you need to do is to substitute about half of the water that the instructions call for with juices from your cooked chicken.  Pour the juices into the measuring cup and add water to bring the total to the desired amount.  I also prefer a little more liquid than what the instructions call for, although one can adjust that to one's personal preference.

review/summary: Review of chocolate frog
review/text: The crispy frog was delicious but it cost me something like twenty five euros in post and packaging! That is ridiculous. How did that happen? It was only a TINY piece of chocolate. I thought that it was the same size as a life size frog. One of the kids in my sons class had brought one to school that she had got in the Harry Potter Studios in Florida. That is what I thought I was ordering. Absolutely ridiculous. Light as a feather so no way could it cost that in postage. It would have fit in an envelope with an ordinary stamp. Felt cheated!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545044251">Harry Potter Boxset Books 1-7</a>

review/text: My husband won't use any other hot sauce but Gib's.  It is a great amount of heat with an equal amount of flavor.  It goes great with anything you can think of.  It's impossible to find in any store - even the "World's Largest Hot Sauce Warehouse" didn't have this brand.  I recommend buying at least a half dozen bottles at a time, because it makes the shipping more proportionate to the product, and you'll use it - I guarantee it!

I was so disappointed when the company closed down.  I was worried when I opened the package that they would just not taste the same but fear not, they are just as I remember.  The cookies look the same, feel the same, taste the same!  I am so happy they are back and my children enjoy them just as much as I did when I was their age.

review/summary: An exquisite cookie!
review/text: Mother's Cookies have been around forever here on the west coast.  I didn't even know they were gone for awhile (due to financial problems I understand).  I am glad Kellogg's bought the company and brought them back.  I recently tried the Vanilla Creme cookie not knowing what to expect.  I was used to the Circus Animals and their delicious chocolate chip cookie over the years since I was a child.  Their Vanilla Creme cookie is just out of this world and makes me glad I have a mouth!  That's how good they are.  It is an exquisite cookie.  No coffee or tea should be served to company without these.  Your friends will wonder what they are and where they come from!<br /><br />In addition to being a great tasting cookie I love the design and texture of the cookie.  I feel really regal when I eat them.  I introduced these to the whole family and I got everyone eating them.  The local supermarket had a sale on them at two dollars a package and I ended up buying seven of them.<br /><br />If you like the taste of vanilla and are looking for a good cookie to try or just plain like cookies, you won't be disappointed with these!<br /><br />UPDATE: I wanted to write a review for Mother's English Tea cookie but apparently Amazon has all the reviews linked to all Mother's cookies products and will only accept one review.<br /><br />I wanted to write that that English Tea cookie by Mother's is just as good as the Vanilla Cremes.  I am not sure but I thought I detected a slight banana flavor but very subtle.  They certainly don't taste like vanilla but they are a really good cookie.<br /><br />Back in the 1970s Mother's Cookies used to put out a variety pack and that's how I discovered their delicious chocolate chip cookie.  It has a chocolate chip taste so different than any other chocolate chip cookie I've eaten.<br /><br />I understand Mother's cookies are hard to find for much of the country except on the west coast.  The fact that Amazon sells them is a good thing.  So if you're wondering if you should give them a try, please believe me, they're all high quality cookies and taste great regardless if they become a favorite or not.  I am very fussy when it comes to food but Mother's cookies are so delicious that I am working my way to try every cookie they offer.  Vanilla Creme is by far my favorite.  As a side note, if your cookies should arrive crumbled or broken, it's the responsibility of the buyer to contact Amazon and complain.  Amazon has friendly customer service and will correct the problem if you complain.

review/summary: Can't get enough of this!!!
review/text: I do not usually eat sweets, as I find most American made desserts too sweet for me. However, these cookies are just so delicious that I cannot put them down! I love how the frosting is not just sugar, but also has a butter cream vanilla taste. It tastes like cake. The sprinkles add just the right amount of crunchiness before you bite into the entire cookie. As you chew, the cookie turns into a mouth watering sweet buttery cake dough. This is why I need to watch myself and count the cookies as I eat, to prevent over eating! Though they all taste the same, I am personally more attracted to the pink ones =) So glad I can get these cookies at Wal-mart!<br />I do not recommend buying this online, just because when it gets hot, the cookies tend to stick together. It is annoying having a double-cookie because they will not separate without breaking. Also, always store in a cookie place! Enjoy your cookies =) Thanks for reading!

review/summary: Mother's Sack-of-Fat Cookies [Caveat Emptor]
review/text: The English Tea and Peanut Butter Gaucho cookies, by Mother's, are probably the best tasting sandwich cookies I've ever eaten. However, this nirvana of the cookie munching experience, comes at a pretty hefty price. As I was gleefully polishing off the first bag, I happened to glance at the nutritional stats on the back. To my astonishment and horror, I found that just two cookies delivered 2.5 grams of saturated fat, 2 grams of trans fat, and a whopping 180 calories! For this reason, I removed one rating star and won't be purchasing these again, until this problem is resolved. C'mon Kelloggs, get yer 'stuff' in one bag and cut the trans fat! Sure, the saturated fat content is rather high, but the trans fat is not only unacceptable, it is entirely unnecessary. These cookies could easily be baked with lighter oils like canola, sunflower, or safflower. If you truly must, buy these cookies at your own risk, or better still, fear for your poor arteries and beg-off! [English Tea - 5, Peanut Butter Gauchos - 5, Iced Lemonade - 4, Iced Oatmeal - 3]

review/summary: small & delicious
review/text: My Mom & I were itchin for a late-nite snack while on vacation out west with the rest of the family; we wandered accross the street from our motel & entered a grocery store. We tried these cookies & thought they were delicious -- small, bite-size tasty cookies w/o too many chips like Chips A;Hoy, etc. When we got back to Cleveland, Ohio, I tried to find them at our local drug stores. Eventually, I found out they are not available east of the Mississippi. ...Really obsessing over a chocolate chip cookie, I found them on a site called 'foodlocker.com'. But after Katrina, they were put out of order (that's unfortunate). One day a few years later, I thought I'd search Amazon, & my cookie-journey had a happy ending. I just wish Mom was still with us to enjoy.

Today we received pack of 4 which were shrink wrapped together and left in box to rattle around during shipment. We opened one package and many of the cookies are crumbled and I suspect the same to be said of those in other 3 packages. I hope someone from Amazon reads these comments and takes corrective action. I can't find these in any stores in Georgia.

They are very slightly larger and flatter, and the chocolate chips have a smoother, less chalky texture and better flavor.  The cookies are also slightly less brittle than they used to be, giving them a better bite and leading to less loose crumbs.

review/summary: Best cookies I've ever had.
review/text: I was given 1 of these cookies from a friend. I savored every bite. After I finished it, I was offered another and I immediately said "YES PLEASE" and I was told I had to buy them on amazon or select states. I ordered the 4 pack. I shared some of them. Everyone that tried them liked them and many of the people are begging me to order more and want to buy them from me. Yes, the Mothers English Tea Sandwitch Cookies are THAT GOOD. If you ever wondered "Why would I ever buy cookies on the internet when there is a large selection at my local stores?" Try these and you will have you answer. If for some reason you don't like them, it won't be hard to find someone to BEG you for more. I know that if they sold these at local stores around here, they would sell a TON. I don't know why they aren't sold nationwide or worldwide at local stores. Maybe they want to keep them "rare" and "special" and not just some "mainstream cookie" and have it be sort of like an "underground special treat", I'm not sure. They are worth every cent of their price. I can't say enough about these cookies. I highly recommend these to everyone. If you have to, have a few friends/family chip in and split it, if you buy the 4 pack and don't like them, you can give the other packs away as gifts/presents. A+ 5 star, my #1 favorite cookies without question.

The seals on the back of the bags were taped to help prevent them from coming open (much appreciated).<br /><br />They tasted great and everyone from kids to adults were happy to see them as a treat.  I will order these again since I can't find big bags on store shelves.

I had never previously tasted them, although I'd seen them many times at WalMart. I thought they would be a less expensive alternative to Famous Amos Chocolate Chip cookies since Amazon has recently increased the price on those considerably. I was very disappointed in the Mother's brand. It did not live up to the compliments expressed in other reviews. They seem to have a strong "baking soda" taste and the chocolate chips have no flavor. I will not purchase these again!

review/summary: Wonderful cookies -----
review/text: When Mother's Cookies was bought out I was devastated.  So many of their cookies are wonderful.  The best are these English Tea cookies and the Iced Animal Crackers.  When I found that these cookies were available, and I was able to subscribe to have them delivered at regular intervals, I was overjoyed.<br /><br />THANK YOU so much for making these available!

review/summary: Best Macaroon's Ever, except.
review/text: On a trip to N.E. Ga we happen to go into a grocery store for snacks to take back to our hotel.<br />Bought these amazing "Rippin Good" macaroons, but can not find them locally. ( And could not get a store to mail us some.)<br /><br />  So on to the internet we go, but alas, no "Rippin Good" cookies available, (I have always said, you can find anything on Amazon.Com),  but we did find these great "Mother's" macaroons and must say they really come close to the "Rippin Good" macaroons.<br /><br />We have not given up our quest, short of driving, 8 hrs., we have telephoned another store and this manager has given hope that they will mail us some.<br /><br />Mother's macaroons are delicious cookies, and I took some to work, and one of the ladies there, ordered a case, she loved them so well.

review/summary: Finding an old favorite
review/text: My sister was visiting and had mentioned these cookies she really enjoyed but had not been able to find in L.A. All she could remember was coconut flavoring with cream in the middle and they were by Mothers. As usual I did an Internet search and got an Amazon hit. I should have known to go to Amazon first. I reviewed the cookies that met the criteria and found Mothers Taffy Sandwich cookies. My sister acknowledge these were "her" cookies. I ordered them and she has not stopped enjoying their great taste. She stated they were as enjoyable as she had remembered. It's always good to find an old favorite.

review/summary: So happy that Circus Animals are back!!!
review/text: I was so distraught to see my favorite cookie company go under and remember buying a bag a couple months after from a second hand seller and thinking "This is probably the last bag I will ever eat!"  Well, I was pleasantly surprised today to have the familiar pink and purple packaging catch my attention from the corner of my eye today.  I bought a bag, wondering if they still tasted the same.  A couple of the cookies were smaller than I remember, but they taste exactly the same:  Perfect.  If you have never had them, I highly recommend you give them a try.  Of all their cookies, the Circus Animal cookies are by far the best in my opinion (which says a lot because their entire selection is absolutely delicious!)

Even better, I created a standing order which is now shipped on a monthly basis.  Mother's Circus cookies are addictive and the best tasting cookies on the market.  I might have to up my order quantity to keep them in the house all month.

review/text: I know...Oreos are the most popular cookie with Chips Ahoy and Nutter Butters are doing pretty well, but these are better than all of those. Cookie wafers with a hint of toasted coconut wrapped around a sweet cream. Heaven in a bag. Unfortunately Mother's went under in 2008 and they didn't exist until Kellogg's bought the label. I was able to find some at HEB in San Antonio, so I have a cache for the apocalypse. Great!

review/summary: Pretty Beat Up  AND EXPIRES IN LESS THEN 2 MONTHS :(
review/text: Original 1 STAR Rating Chocolate Chip Cookies:<br />...12/16/2010 Splendid bubble wrapping AND a pristine box condition deceivingly held 4 packages of crumbles. I surmise these were in pretty bad shape before the bubble wrap was applied and boxed for shipment. To add insult to injury packages have BEST BY DATE of FEB0311 ...less than two months away :( The seller would have done better hosting an ice cream social using these crumbles for toppings. I'm not sure how prospective customers can be informed items are near their expiration date or the condition is sub par, but they should be given the option to purchase "less than standard product". I won't gamble ordering ANY Mother's Cookies again.<br /><br />This holiday will have more cookie crumbs than usual, ugh!<br /><br />9/2/2011 5 STARS ... Coconut Cocadas ... Smaller Version of the Old Time Favorite<br /><br />OMG Still yummy! It was like a stroll down Memory Lane. The coconut flavor carries me back to my childhood in New Jersey sitting on the front steps munching away figuring which adventure us neighborhood kids would be getting into. It wasn't until years later that my Mom weaned us off Drake's Coconut Jumbles and onto these to save money. Though not as coco-nutty  as Drakes's Jumbles these were always available. Neither were as good as any cookies my Grannies made :)

review/text: When I got these, I was looking for frosted animal crackers. However what I didn't realize is these have an abundance of frosting -- they're not just frosted on top, but covered in frosting.<br /><br />Maybe that's what customers buying this are looking for, but I am not interested in that much sugar.<br /><br />I usually eat about 20-25 or so of these in one night, but to work them off I'd have to run a quarter marathon (6.5 miles).  When I just get back from the gym, that is not what I want to see on the package.

review/summary: Taffy cookies are NOT the same!
review/text: How dissappointing. I have fond memories of the Taffy cookies from my late grandmother and her always full cookie jars.  Imagine my dissappointment when I discovered these "New" Taffy cookies are not the same.  They have too much coconut in the recipe.  The old Taffy cookies were darker brown in color and had a completely different flavor.  I wouldn't say these new cookies are terrible, but if you are labeling them as "TAFFY" cookies, they are definitely not a resurrection of the late greats :(

review/text: I saw a bag in the grocery aisle and had to have it.  Boy, was I sorely disappointed.  The cookies aren't half as big as I remember them being.  They were all clumped together from all the nauseating pink and white frosting.  Yeah, you actually get more pink and white frosting than you do an actual cookie.  Blecch.  These cookies are a suga-holic hyperactive kid's dream and nothing more.  I won't be buying them again.  So sad to see a good, good thing go away.

review/text: So we got this because my wife was craving chocolate cereal. Of course it tastes really good although she feels it is not superior. The biggest issue we had with it is that the best before (BB/expiry) date was barely about a month from the date it was received and two of us cannot finish 6 packs of cereal in that time. That's one thing you can check when you are buying your stuff from a grocery store in person but not online.

review/summary: Great but not best to eat all the time
review/text: I've always loved this cereal but when I've tried to keep corn syrup out of my diet (because things just taste better without it!) this is on the list of things to avoid for that reason.<br /><br />This cereal is GREAT in milk, you get chocolate milk to finish off in the bowl, also the cereal is fairly filling if you just needed a quick bowl, if you are looking for a full meals worth of eating, you may find yourself finishing these boxes in about 5 bowls like myself.<br /><br />The cereal keeps its crunchiness longer than other cereals by comparison and the crunch is satisfying with milk, there never seems to be an offensive hardness to this cereal by my opinion.<br /><br />Who doesn't like to go crazy for these puffs? You may look at other chocolate cereals or even something like cookie crisp for your chocolate taste buds, but they don't compare to this one. A no-bull straight up chocolate corn puffs that make for great left over chocolate milk in your bowl in the morning!

review/summary: Add pasilla chile powder to make them even better.
review/text: These are good on their own, warmed up with some cheese melted over the top... or as the main ingredient in a burrito.  You don't need to doctor them at all for them to be delicious.  They really are my favorite canned refried beans.  But if you are desiring something a little spicier, I like to add some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041FPHD0">pasilla chile powder</a> and chopped onions for knocking it up a notch or two.  Throw a little sour cream and/or guacamole in the mix and you have lunch.<br /><br />I buy lots of different brands of black refried beans and these just seem to be the most consistent in terms of quality and flavor.  They are thick and have a deep, rich color & smell to them that is pleasing as soon as you open the can.  Really, eating them straight from the can with a spoon or fork is a very viable option.  They are that tasty.  Also they contain a low amount of fat, moderate sodium and a lot of fiber so as a meal choice they are pretty healthy.  Well, probably not after I get done dumping sour cream and cheese on them, but at least they started out good for me!

I can't cook  mexican food without having my corn cake.  Everytime I make it I get so many compliments.  I was surprised how many people haven't even tried something like this.  The mix is so easy to make and very delicious.  It's also a lot less expensive than it was in the grocery store in CA.  You will love it!

Ever.<br /><br />Mixes up in 2 minutes or less by adding melted butter/margarine, water and a can of creamed corn.  Directions say to bake in a loaf pan, but I've baked one in an 8x8 pan when I needed to make 2 packs at once and it came out just fine with a shortened bake time. (I would only recommend using a non-loaf pan if you have baked more than once or twice and can gauge for yourself when a baked item is done.)<br /><br />Moister and sweeter than corn bread, I like to serve it with a round ice cream scoop!<br /><br />In my grocery store, one package is $$1.99 so this is a sweet deal!

review/text: Since moving to the States my kids have really missed 'English' squash. They squealed with delight when I opened the package and showed them what was inside.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: We had been purchasing this from a local market that carries international foods but have found the "no sugar added" seems to sell out quickly. I add a small amount to a glass of water and it is wonderful. I don't find it has any artificial taste. Love it! The no sugar added orange is great as well.<br /><br />As a previous review said, you won't find a better price for this except in the UK, especially with the subscribe and save option.

review/summary: Great priced drink!
review/text: At this price I don't think you will find it anywhere cheaper except in England!  I use it in my iced tea for extra flavor.  Can't beat it unless you have an endless supply of fresh fruits!!!
