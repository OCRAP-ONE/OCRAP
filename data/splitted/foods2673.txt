review/text: My breeder recommended these for my 4 lb. "Morkie" - she is very selective and picky about treats, chews, etc. She says many are dangerous - especially for tiny dogs like mine.  My Lilly "adores" these! I think she would gobble up the entire bag if I let her.  They are chicken and rice - nice and crunchy - small enough for her tiny mouth..... I highly recommend these!!

review/summary: Favorite tea thus far
review/text: I've tried a few different flavors but this flavor is by far my favorite.  It produces a strong, solid, slightly spicy flavor with a minimal amount of tea.  Sugar is almost unnecessary.  The leaves are re-usable up to about 3 times.  I'd order this over and over if the number of flavors available wasn't as enticing as it is!

review/summary: The spiciest chai
review/text: I am a chai snob. I love chai, but have demanding standards about what I will and won't drink. Most lattes are too sweet and not spicy enough for me. This tea is far and away the most spicy, full of a rich flavors of cinnamon, ginger and cardamom, and yet, it has a very sweet note as well, probably because of the carob. The oolong tea leaves allow you to steep it long enough to get a strongly spiced flavor without the tea tannins going bitter. I don't even blend it into milk or add sugar -- I think a strongly brewed cup is perfect as it is. It's great to travel with if you have a strainer mug or brew it before you go, because even as it cools off it continues to taste spicy yet sweet. I much prefer it to Teavana's other chai blends, and over any other chai I've had really. While pricey, I find 2 oz. lasts about two weeks if you drink one large 12oz tumblr of tea a day, and longer if you're drinking an 8oz mug. The used leaves don't rebrew particularly well and take on a kind of "metallic" taste if you boil the leaves to try and improve the weak flavor of the rebrew, but this seems a small criticism of an otherwise excellent and robust tea.

review/summary: Cat Food Made With Not-Disgusting Ingredients! Who Knew?
review/text: THE SHORT VERSION: My picky cats took to this immediately and it seems to have helped them with their digestive (throwing up) issues. The ingredients are much healthier than the standard "animal by-products" found in even the pricier pet food brands (IAMS, Pedigree, Fancy Feast, etc.). Even though it's a little more expensive, I think it's worth it. This company also makes a similar product for dogs that is packaged in a similar-looking bag, so make sure you get the correct stuff.<br /><br />Now for the longer version...<br /><br />PRO:<br />(1) Healthier for the cats! No scary bits-and-pieces-by-products ingredients! Many pet food brands - many "premium" pet-food brands have the exact same disgusting ingredients as el cheapo store brands, but charge you three times the price and give you the false idea that you're feeding your pets well.<br /><br />(2) Small pieces -- my cats don't seem to like the bigger kibble sizes. The dog food version of this has much larger pieces with little peas/carrots mixed in.<br /><br />(3) Nice packaging -- I like these plastic bags much more than the standard paper bags (that often tear) and the cardboard boxes (that are easily dumped by the cats). Plus, if the water dish gets knocked over, it won't soak through the bag and make the food soggy and gross.<br /><br />(4) Did I mention healthier for the pets? Seriously, everyone should find out what's in standard pet food, because it's completely disgusting and in no way safe or healthy for pets. While I won't be eating my pets' food any time soon, at least with Halo I know that (technically) I probably could. And if I had little kids running around, I'd rather have a brand of pet food like this around in case curious kids decide to taste it.<br /><br />CON:<br />(1) Harder to find -- I have been purchasing this from my local organic store. I have not seen it carried at any other grocery/drugstore and I live in a fairly large metropolitan area. It may be carried at a PETCO/other pet chain, but the last time I went into a big pet box store, there were NO healthy cat foods. Everything had byproducts and gross stuff. So I haven't been back to one of those to check for HALO. Since PETCO apparently carries it online now, they are probably carrying it in the stores as well. But it doesn't seem to be any cheaper there than at my organic store, so I'll stick to the local store. Speaking of price...<br /><br />(2) Cost -- It's not a ridiculous price and is certainly worth it when you compare ingredients, but it's hard to get other family/friends to buy good stuff for their own pets when they can pick up el cheapo pet food for a buck or two. I'm trying to find it online for a little cheaper, but so far (once S+H is factored), haven't found it yet. I'd also like to buy it in bulk, but haven't found that yet either.<br /><br />MINOR ANNOYANCE:<br />The Bag Design - HALO carries wet and dry food for cats and dogs. They also seem to carry the same flavor for each animal - for instance, there is Wild Salmon Cat Food and Wild Salmon Dog Food. Now, the first time I buy a new food brand for the cats, I do exactly what I do for myself: I turn the package over and read the description and all the ingredients before buying. When I go to buy more, I don't usually read it. So I just grabbed the pink bag that said HALO and Spot's Stew - Wild Salmon. When I dumped some of the food into my cats' bowl, the kibbles were about twice the size and also had little peas and carrots in it. I thought that was weird, but assumed they had changed the packaging. Then when I put the bag back into the cabinet, I noticed something - in the picture on the front of the bag, the woman was holding a dog. Not a cat. And of course, then I read it, saw that it saw DOG FOOD, and felt kind of silly. But you know, pink bag, watercolor-like picture of woman with an animal, had the correct flavor and brand...anyway, the cats were not really that interested in the dog food, but they ate about a bowl or so and also had wet food until I could get back to the organic store for cat food. Luckily, I had someone to give the dog food to so it didn't go to waste. If you're buying this, make sure it says cat food. The bags are similar and if you're in a hurry and not paying attention, you might end up with the wrong stuff.<br /><br />Apparently Ellen Degeneres is a co-owner of this company, which is cool, I guess, so if you need a celebrity thumbs-up before you buy anything, you've got at least one!

review/summary: Premium, high quality, tasty cat food
review/text: I have not yet purchased this product from this particular vendor, but I will say that this is a top of the line pet food with a taste that my finicky cat loves. (I purchased a bag from the local natural food store.) Great ingredient list and minimal grain/carbohydrate content. I personally would choose the pea protein and barley this food contains over potato or "potato starch" which is found in most pet foods marketed as "grain-free". This is not the cheapest pet food on the market, but you get what you pay for. I would highly recommend this food for those looking for a premium dry cat food. My cat eats mostly wet and raw foods, but I sprinkle this dry food  on top since he loves it so much.

review/summary: Junk Food labeled as healthy food.
review/text: "Pea Protein" is a leading ingredient in these foods. This shouts "WARNING!" at anyone who knows about nutrition. Adding this processed ingredient is a sneaky way to reduce the amount of meat needed to meet minimum protein levels and it has a hidden way of possibly harming your pet. Naming the ingredient "pea protein" indicates that the pea has been hydrolyzed and that processed free glutamic acid (same harmful chemical that is in MSG) is present.<br /><br />MSG can harm your pet, just as it can harm people. Only some pets are affected by MSG just as only some people are. Also, many processed pet foods will contain some form of MSG.  There is just no way to know if your pet is getting headaches from it's food as the pet will probably not make the connection on it's own. Try to stick to simple raw diets when you can. If you have to feed pre-processed foods, avoid "hydrolyzed" anything or " corn/soy/wheat/pea protein" in the ingredient list to keep your pets happy and healthy.<br /><br />Also, people should know that cooked grains have no place in the canine/feline diet. Come to think of it, I'm pretty sure cooked anythings have no place in the canine or feline diet.<br /><br />Want a healthy pet? Keep It Simple, Silly<br /><br />If you want a vibrantly healthy, flea-free pet, feed a raw diet. If you can't afford a commercially prepared raw diet, then just feed raw meaty bones (chicken thighs, legs, wings, turkey necks, beef ribs...). If you can't do this all of the time then do it 3 days a week and feed a good quality canned or air-dried food on other days (not freeze-dried). If your pet seems to need more wellness at any point in time, increase the raw meals. There are many online resources that can help you to learn how to feed raw. Adding organs is not always necessary (unless an imbalance is detected). Also, vegetables are completely unnecessary in the canine/feline diet. Most pets do perfectly well on a diet of meat and bone with nothing more. Keep it simple (add other ingredients only if the need arises).<br /><br />If you need to feed a dry, prepared diet, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AYIJDO">ZiwiPeak 'Daily-Dog' Cuisine;</a> or  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AY97RG">ZiwiPeak 'Daily-Cat' Cuisine; \; Venison & Fish; </a>  It will cost more than feeding raw meats, but at least it doesn't have grains in it and you shouldn't have the vet bills that would come along with feeding the products pushed by the above referenced book.<br /><br />Good Luck, pet lovers.

review/text: I don't normally like fruit-flavored teas, but this one is very good. The pomegranate taste is subtle enough that it doesn't feel like it's clashing with anything else in the packet. They make a great iced tea.<br /><br />These bags have a bit less actual tea in them than most others, but they also seem to steep more thoroughly. I like these "sachet" bags; they sink better than the traditional sorts and don't trap air bubbles.

review/summary: deceptive rip off?  bland flavour
review/text: Honestly, my dissatisfaction is partially my mistake for not reading the tin well enough.  I thought I was getting loose tea, since that's what you normally get in this kind of container (Twinnings), not a mere 20 tea bags.  The tin is full of these sachets and very little tea - its practically empty!<br />I'm also dubious about the flavouring. The tin says "Exootic Oolong with Pomegranate" on the front.  In the fine print on the back, it says, "... pomegranate flavor".  So I'm now guessing that its not natural pomegranate flavour, but some weird chemical concoction that I really don't want to ingest!  So either its artificially flavoured and artfully packaged to give the impression of being naturally flavoured, or its full of the good stuff and their marketing dept. has mistakenly neglected to make this obvious.  I'm cynical, so I'm guessing the former conclusion. That's why I'm giving the one star.<br />As for the flavour, its not that good.  I just get a nose full of the (artificial) pomegranate flavour and none of the tea.<br /><br />btw - if I'm proven wrong about my conclusion about the flavouring, I'll gladly edit my review.

review/text: We used to eat conch all the time in Florida and the Caribbean.  We were even able to buy fresh, tenderized conch in the grocery stores in Florida.  No more.  I guess it is an endangered species as it is hard to find on restaurant menus any more, also.  I learned how to make milk based Conch Chowder years ago when it was plentiful.  Boy, have I missed this delicacy.  I never thought that canned conch would be as good as fresh, but it's definitely the next best thing.  I usually use 4 cans of conch to make 2 gallons of chowder.  It is delicious.  I give this product 5 stars.  If you love conch, and know how to prepare it, you will love this product.  I have this auto shipped, so we eat conch chowder every other month.

This is not the larger-sized boxes, but the 7 serving size (if you only eat 2/3 cup per serving - not much of a chance of that!) so it doesn't have a chance to get sticky and chewy before it is gone.

review/text: I have been looking for an "authentic" mint syrup ever since Ferrara Mint syrup became scarce. This is not only good, it's better!! The mint truly sings and is not cloyed by sugar like the Torani version or funkly medicinal taste like other brands I tried.<br />This tastes exactly like the refreshing "menta" I used to enjoy on hot summer nights while growing up in Italy. Mix it with cold sparkling water for an extra "twist", or with cold milk (this last may sound weird, but it's delicious), also try it over ice cream or with rum for a Mojito out of this world. Salute!

review/text: First of all, I love amazon.com and I have always enjoyed the convenience of making a few clicks to purchace almost anything I want and get it delivered right away. I rarely write product reviews but I think I should this time to let others know what I have found out. If you have Asian grocery store within driving distance and you would like to get this product, I recommend you get it from there or at least make a trip to check out the price. I was shocked to find out that I could have gotten this product for 10 dollars less (it is $19.95 at the store). The product itself is OK - it wasn't as soft as they said it is so I cook with "brown rice mode" with my rice cooker. To be honest, I cannot really tell the difference from the regular brown rice, but I am a big fan of Koshihikari (premium short grain rice) so I think I will continue to buy this product unless I find better alternatives - but never from Amazon again!!

review/summary: The best brown rice ever!
review/text: First off, the other review is correct, $30 is overpriced and if you can find this in a local Asian market, you will find it for less.  However, this is the best tasting brown rice I have ever had.  I completely understand the comment that it was too mushy/soft.  When I cooked this with the brown rice setting of my rice cooker, it came out a gooey mess.  The trick is to cook it exactly as you would cook white rice.  If you do that, you will find it tastes almost exactly like white rice, but you get all the health and nutritional benefits of brown rice.  This will be my go to brown rice from now on.

review/summary: Authentic Italian Marinara
review/text: I agree with the first reviewer.  It is absolutely the best.  It does cost more, but it is worth every penny, because it tastes like it came right out of an Italian kitchen.  I bought two bottles of this sauce and made a delcious lasagna with it.  I browned 1 pound of ground sausage, 1 pound of ground beef, added the 2 bottles of sauce, and then added 2 fresh cloves of pressed garlic.  In between the layers of the meat sauce and pasta, I added lowfat cottage cheese, freshly chopped parsely, and grated sharp cheddar cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  You could use this sauce in so many different ways and would never be disappointed with the outcome of your meal.

review/summary: What Happened to the Rao's recipe
review/text: I have always been a fan or Rao's Marinara sauce and willing to shell out the premium price of $7-$9 a bottle. However of late (I would say within the last 3-6 months) the recipe or process has apparently changed. The sauce is no where near as fresh tasting as it once was. The sauce is now more homogenized and bland to the point that I will no longer shell out the premium price for a product that is no better then sauces selling for $2 a bottle. It is sad that the company has cut corners in the way that they have (perhaps they have expanded production and are using a new supplier). I hope that they return to their original recipe or drop the new manufacturing source.<br /><br />Considering the price point and the average quality I would rate the current product as poor.<br /><br />I would be interested in other opinions.<br /><br />Sign me an unhappy customer.

review/summary: Brain Food?!
review/text: I became a fan of dried shiitake mushrooms upon receiving a sample at Costco (rehydrated in warm water and saut&eacute;ed with a dried garlic parmesan mix).  Delicious but after a year my Costco stopped carrying it.  These are the best value on Amazon and excellent quality.  I've ordered 4 lbs. for myself now.  They keep for ages, just clip the bag shut.  There are big slices in the bag but they can be easily crushed by hand into recipes where smaller pieces are desired.<br /><br />In the winter, my most convenient use is to drop a handful into 8 oz. of water in a small pot and bring it to a simmer (I include a big pinch of rolled oats if I'm really hungry).  Stir for a minute, then turn off the heat and add a can of Campbell's condensed chicken noodle soup.  The final temp. is just right for me this way.  Total prep. time 5 minutes, 1 pot, 1 spoon.<br /><br />Here's the interesting part.  I'm an inventor.  I always have a few challenging projects going at a time. They are ambitious so I often run into problems of an engineering/math/physics type.  They can seem insurmountable, so when this happens I switch projects to give my subconscious mind a chance to work on the problem.  Anytime, I'm stuck in traffic, standing in line, or just bored, I roll out the problem and ponder it.  It's been my habit for decades.  What I noticed by accident is that 24-36 hours after eating the dried shiitakes, my problem solving yield goes way up.  At first, I was just happy to have the new ideas but then I noticed this happens more in cold weather.  That corresponds to the soup trick, and after many trials I have to say it seems reliable.  I even save up problems now, in my head, have the soup and wait in happy anticipation for progress.<br /><br />To be clear, there is no "high" experienced here.  I feel perfectly normal after eating these and I wouldn't have noticed a thing except for my habit of always having some problem in the back of my mind to work on.  Also, the effect is not immediate.  Ideas, start at about 24 hours after ingestion and seem to peak at 36 hours fading gradually by about 56 hours.  If I were still in college, I would want to time ingestion for peak problem solving on tough exams.<br /><br />I would be very interested in anyone else reporting this kind of effect (or lack of it).

I prefer the oyster mushrooms or the blends of mixed mushrooms they sell (the blends have shitake in them also).

review/summary: Bushmills 1608 is a an usually rich and complex Irish whiskey
review/text: Bushmills 1608 is a  limited anniversary edition made with a more richly flavored grain: crystal malt.<br /><br />Rosy amber - coppery - in the glass.  It's a much richer color than usually seen in Irish.<br /><br />The nose is rich and sweet with butterscotch, maple, and malted milk with vanilla and sherry lingering.  It's yummy.<br /><br />Entry is toffee sweet with a gentle midpalate expansion of sherry, vanilla, cream soda with muted hints of the Bushmills mint.  It is a rich and sweet presentation.  Peppery around edges of tongue. Finish is gentle and relatively short, arriving with drier notes of herbal bitters, oats, and more oaky vanilla.  The herbal quality adds a bitter final note that feels bracing - a balance to the sweetness up front.  The herbal final note is recognizably kin to the mint found earlier in the palate in the more commonly met Bushmills & Bushmills black.<br /><br />All in all a richer more complex array of flavors than one usually meets in an Irish whiskey.  Bravo.  If it weren't for Middletons I'd say this rivaled the top of the heap.  This is clearly one of Ireland's stand out whiskeys.  Highly recommended.

review/text: I'm a huge fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTMLM">Ezekiel 4:9 cereal</a>, which is absolutely delicious (especially hot) as well as wholesome. Ezekiel 4:9 bread (which is sold frozen) is also pretty good. But their spaghetti? Not so much.<br /><br />First off, no matter how much you boil it, it has a rough texture that takes away the great aesthetic virtue of spaghetti: that delicate, wrap-around-your-fork silkiness. And then there's the taste. It's difficult to describe (one favorable reviewer compares it to a bran muffin); in any case, it's a distinctive flavor that, in my opinion, does not play well with pasta sauce. And if spaghetti won't go with sauce, then what's the point?

review/text: So, this tastes nothing like durum semolina wheat pasta.  BUT, it's a delicious, healthy alternative for people who are watching their carbs or gluten intake OR for people who want a high-protein low-carb option that fills you up.  This pasta *is* the noodle equivalent of a bran muffin.  I find it goes well with heavy meat-based sauces - think the hearty "just like Grandma used to make" variety.  Once you get used to this taste, it's delicious, but it is NOT a wheat pasta substitute... that would be like saying bran muffins are a substitute for Wonderbread.

They also eat a much more healthy diet overall which can counter the negative effects of the small quantities of tofu they do eat.

review/text: We don't eat a lot of pasta (I tend to limit our wheat intake, including bread, etc.)  I appreciate and know the idea between sprouted wheat and on the rare occasion that I buy bread, I buy sprouted wheat bread.<br /><br />Because we don't eat a lot of pasta - and I LOVE pasta, I usually just buy the real thing, in a high quality, fresh brand - or, when I have time, I make fresh pasta at home.<br /><br />However, I tried out a new recipe that called for wheat pasta.  I would have used regular pasta, but the nuttier flavor of wheat pasta was better for this particular recipe.  Against my better judgment, I decided to try this stuff.<br /><br />I'm no stranger to cooking pasta.  I've even successfully used gluten free pastas with no trouble.  I understand about "not overcooking."  But this stuff was something else.  I tested frequently and yet the line between undercooked and gummy/overcooked is very very fine.<br /><br />I tried to eat a plate of dinner, but it was nasty.  I don't have any issue with the flavor - it's earthy & nutty.  But the texture and gumminess is DISGUSTING.  I wound up throwing the entire dinner away.  And looking forward to a proper pasta night.  I will not touch this stuff again.

review/text: I agree with many of the statements made in the reviews posted so far about the product's characteristics.  Bottom line, if you're expecting anything at all like regular spaghetti, you'll be disappointed, and some will hate the taste and texture, some will like them.  And for those that like them, the taste does go very well with meat-based sauces.  (As a fast-but-good meal, I often eat it with tuna mixed into a good quality supermarket sauce.)<br /><br />One thing not mentioned is it holds sauce alot better than spaghetti, so it's better than spaghetti if you prepare spaghetti by undercooking, draining (but not rinsing), mixing the heated sauce and spaghetti together in the original pot, and finishing by letting the pot sit covered for a few minutes.  With this product, you won't leave any sauce on your plate.

review/text: I use this to strengthen tomato recipes and sauces,<br />add zest to soups and veggies, and wish I had<br />discovered it sooner.  It keeps very well in the<br />frig and I am not constantly freezing bits of canned<br />tomato paste left over.  Just a squirt or two does<br />it for lack luster veggies, flat soups, cuts down<br />on the use of the ever present butter when something<br />seems to lack flavor.  Even perks up a dry hamburger.<br />Very happy!

review/summary: leaking tube - no replacement offered
review/text: Received the 4 pack of tubes with one of the tubes showing a lot of leakage.  Obviously any food product that is opened or damaged should never be consumed.  Sadly, this seller does not offer replacements and claims no responsibility for damages so I'm out of luck.  I don't think this product was damaged during shipping because the shipping and product boxes were both in tact.  The tube had leaked inside of its own undamaged box and the paste was not fresh but rather dried on the outside of the tube.  Probably sat this way on their shelves and they never checked before shipping.<br /><br />One less tomato-goodness meal for me.  At least I have 3 other tubes to squeeze.  I don't think I would purchase food products online again.  Definitely not from a seller that won't check their products before shipping or offer replacements.

review/summary: Delightful flavor, silky texture. Wonderful!
review/text: Tuna Ventresca is the very best tuna in oil you can buy and Tonnino is an excellent brand. If you are lucky to find it locally, buy a jar and you'll get instantly hooked. It tastes SO much better than regular canned tuna.<br /><br />This is not the tuna you'd use for tuna salad or sandwiches, keep buying the regular canned tuna for that. The ventresca (fillets from the tender belly of the tuna) shines as the centerpiece of a salad (e.g., salade ni�oise) or on toasted rounds of baguette or crackers.<br /><br />Six or so years ago I spotted the red label tuna jars at Trader Joe's; back then they were $4.99 which seemed rather expensive to me, but the tuna inside those jars looked so nice I just had to try it. The following week I bought a half dozen jars and kept replenishing my stock until TJ stopped carrying this tuna a couple of years later. I've been looking for it ever since, but very few stores carry it locally and the price has gone up quite a bit.<br /><br />About a month ago I was very happy to find tuna Ventresca here, but it was by a different manufacturer (Roland) and it was canned. I ordered it, regardless, because the price was reasonable and I was hoping that the taste and texture would be the same as the Tonnino brand, but it wasn't.<br /><br />Luckily, Ventresca by Tonnino is now available so I discontinued my Subscribed and Save order for the Roland brand and ordered two cases of this wonderful Ventresca packed in glass jars. It is so much better and, when you order two cases, the shipping cost stays almost the same which makes the price per ounce a few cents lower than the Ventresca by Roland deal, which comes in tins and is not as nice and silky as this brand.<br /><br />I realize this review is rather wordy but I wanted to let the prospective buyers know that one can get a very good deal by ordering two cases.<br /><br />Right now only two retailers carry this wonderful tuna Ventresca in my area and both charge $6.99 per jar. Amazon's price is only 4 cents more and I don't have to drive 35 miles to get it.<br /><br />Also, the vendor, Taylor's Market, did a great job of packing the jars. They arrived in perfect condition, see photos under "customer images".

review/summary: A very good middle-of-the-road blend for those who just want a plain old cup of coffee...
review/text: The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done. We were searching for a blend that was smooth and flavorful while still being easy to drink and mild. I particularly like medium roasts and I don't care for a coffee with a lot of acidity and a bitter aftertaste, so this one fits the bill.<br /><br />The only downside to this k cup is that the aroma. It wasn't the most appetizing after the first cup was brewed, but it made up for that in taste. This isn't a point that really bothers me, but I could see it being a downside for some people.<br /><br />When I brew this blend on my way out the door, I often throw in some french vanilla creamer and it's my perfect morning caffeine kick.<br /><br />So far this is the best average blend we've tried. We're open to others but until we find something better, we're sticking with the Caribou Blend.

review/text: When I took a Chinese cooking class from a lady whose family owns 5 restaurants and specializes in Chinese gourmet dishes (yes there are common recipes and then there are superior tasting recipes with slightly more exotic ingredients and fancier preparation). She recommended Kikkoman which is slightly sweet over the saltier brands. Because of that I can use more volume to create more sauce without over powering the vegetables and meats. Gourmet recipes call for thick and thin soy sauce. An easier substitute is to combine the measurements and use Kikkoman.

review/summary: A must-have if you have celiac kids!
review/text: When our family was diagnosed as celiac, and began life on a strict gluten-free diet, brownies were something we really missed. Then we discovered Namaste Brownie Mix - not only are the brownies GREAT, but it is as easy as can be to make them - eggs, water, oil, stir, bake.<br /><br />I also like the fact that Namaste mixes are a great value - this makes a full pan of brownies (most GF mixes are scanty and make only a small pan) and it isn't that expensive. That means I can send brownies for the class party and not spend $20 doing so. Oh, and the best part? When I do send brownies for the class party, ALL the kids love them and nobody cares that they are gluten-free (except the celiac child who gets to fully participate in the party for a change).

But inside was a fudge-y goodness that has the family happy.  Amazingly good.  I will make these for my sister in law too but sub for the eggs since she can't have those either.  I can't wait to try the blondie mix on my counter and I also have the pancake mix too.  Amazon has a great price compared to local markets.

They were the first gluten free baking mix I'd ever tried and I was satisfied with the resulting gooey chocolate bars. They satisfied my craving.<br /><br />The texture was a different but not enough to throw me and the flavor was great.<br /><br />They were very sweet with the main ingredient (if I recall correctly) being sugar plus I added the amount of chocolate chips they suggested for a variation. But I don't eat a lot of sweets so I am pretty sensitive to sweet foods compared to someone with a more standard western diet.<br /><br />I just found I was gluten sensitive so this is a whole new game for me and I appreciate having these products to help me out.

So really your get 12 different treats. Or you can cook all at once in a 13x9 pan. Then I top it of with my Chocolate gluten free, dairy free, soy free frosting. Yum. That's why buying bulk of six works for me. Much cheaper on amazon then in stores too. Like $2 a bag.

review/text: Although I don't have celiac, I am trying to cut down on wheat flour in my diet, so I've tried to go gluten-free in some of my baking.  I'd tried the Namaste spice cake mix in the past (great for making carrot cake), so I gave the brownies a try.  Wow, am I glad I did!  These make a full 9x13 pan of some of the darkest chocolate brownies I've ever found, with great taste and a very fudgy texture.  When I don't need to make them for an event, I bake them in 2 8x8 pans and freeze one for future enjoyment, with no loss in quality.  They are extra good with some toasted nuts or semi-sweet chocolate chips thrown in, as well as raisins if you want to turn them into a baked version of a Cadbury bar.<br /><br />One heads up - even though my oven can be "slow" when baking other items, I've found that I can take these out of the oven a couple minutes early.  I strongly recommend toothpick testing, so you don't overbake them.<br /><br />Given my good experiences with two of the Namaste baking products, I'm ready to try more.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: Another excellent mix from Namaste and once again, people can't even tell it's gluten free. And unlike some other gluten free products they actually hold their texture and I don't need to microwave them to bring the texture back.<br /><br />If you don't have peanut allergies - toss in some peanut butter chips with the batter. Peanut butter brownies :)

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: These brownies  had a bitter cocoa taste that even frosting could not make sweet.  I would add a cup of sugar if I were ever to make these again. I used 2 eggs instead of 3 and added about a tablespoon of water. It had a wonderful chewy texture however.

review/summary: Yummy!!
review/text: I love these!! Its very difficult to put these down, but they are an acquired taste and texture. These chips are very similar to the "styrofoam" that come in the bottom of chinese take out (its actually a soy and rice cracker). I think they are delicious and if it have ever eaten other rice crackers you will enjoy these, they have a shrimp aftertaste and are a tiny bit sweet.  I highly recommend picking up a bag of these and trying them out.

review/summary: It's all about convenience--Sometimes that's important!
review/text: The whole range of Chef Boyardee/ConAgra microwavable bowls are like a civilian version of the military's MRE's-- Portable, shelf stable, and ready to heat and eat at any time. They taste decent, and will hold you for several hours if you can't get away from the office for lunch, or are stuck at work late at night. Far cheaper than ordering out!  This variety is a departure from the usual pasta/tomato sauce types on their menu, and it's quite good.  More rice than chicken and veggies, but hey, it's a microwave emergency ration.  Very good for what it is, and almost no extra liquid.  I keep at least one in my desk for emergencies.

review/summary: A great Gluten-Free product!
review/text: It's very difficult to find gluten free products that are convenient for travel, cost effective and taste good.  This one fits all those criteria.

review/summary: Convenient, but not a complete success
review/text: This range of microwavable meals is extremely convenient.  They don't require refrigeration and can be heated up quickly and eaten straight from the bowl.  The 7.25 ounce size is not an adult meal, just a light snack.<br /><br />The pasta and chilli valieties are very good, this rice variety fares less well.  Rice is not as amenable as pasta to this type of processing.  It was too soggy for my taste.  It is solidly packed - not watery - which is good.  The taste was fine, if bland.  There was very little chicken.  I think I'll have one occasionally (the 12-pack on Amazon is very competitively priced) as a change from pasta.<br /><br />The instructions say microwave for 45 seconds, but I found it needed a full minute.

review/summary: Awesome~ Taste great
review/text: I've been eating a lot of Chef Boyardee products since I started my healthier eating plan a month ago. Before my healthy eating plan I was eating very unhealthy. So when I decided that it was time for me to make some changes, i was looking into buying food from Nutrisystem, etc because they are convenience and supposedly healthy. However I found out those diet packaged food are no better than the package food in the store, I was like, "screw that, i'll pick my own from the store."<br />The downside of any packaged food is the sodium content, is always high for some oddly reason. Chef Boyardee's microcups are very affordable in comparison to my typical fast meals I purchase from my school.<br /><br />The serving is just about right, it's enough to keep me fill 'til dinner time actually. People who say this is not enough for lunch could be that they are not eating a filling breakfast. My breakfast is no milk and cereal or granola bar, but a full size breakfast. I have plain oatmeal as my main carb in the morning along with protein, so i sometimes have a small dish of stir-fried chicken or grilled chicken or eggs and a plate of green if possible.<br /><br />My dinner is usually whole-grain /whole-wheat pasta topped with homemade Alfredo sauce or a variety of poultry on top of that.<br /><br />Anyhow, going back to Chef Boyardee Rice with Chicken & Vegetables.<br />I love the taste and flavor...it has the right about of flavoring.<br />I used to get their Beefaroni, but that gets to have too much sugar, it's like 5g-6 per serving and the lasagna is even higher at 7g.<br />This Chicken rice veggie cup only has 1g of sugar, definitely a plus on that.<br /><br />Anyhow, the only thing i wish they could do is do better on the sodium content.<br /><br />Rating:<br /><br />Taste (5/5)<br />Size (4/5)<br />Nutritional value (3/5)<br />Price (4/5)<br />Convenience (5/5)

review/summary: who doesnt love chef boyardee?
review/text: I had these sent to a friend who I knew was ill and shut in with no one to help him cook. All you do is take of the thin metal cover -put the plastic one back on-30 seconds in the microwave --and you have yourself the perfect size serving of food/dinner.I will lose this in the future as it gave me piece of mind to know that-even though I could not be there--they did have food..
