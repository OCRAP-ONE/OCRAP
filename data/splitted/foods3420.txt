review/summary: k cups Coffee people
review/text: Coffee People has the best k cups if you like extra bold coffee. The Jet Fuel is the boldest of all with little bitterness and a real kick. It is smooth and rich. You can't beat the price on Amazon 2 - 24 count boxes for $21.00. If you like Dunkin' Donuts coffee, I would also recommend the donut shop blend from Coffee People. Jet Fuel is more like a Starbucks cup of coffee without the rude Barista's and enormous price tag.

review/text: This Coffee is strong. Everything I drink says bold or extra bold on the label. This coffee is strong. If you don't like it strong back up slowly and step away from the Jet Fuel.<br />On first drink this one can be overpowering. By the third time you drink it you'll enjoy the punch. I love this coffee. It might be my favorite.<br />I like Wake Up Call and Parisian Nights for every day, but I only drink one cup on weekends and this really hits the spot. No over roasted flavor here. Just really good strong coffee.

review/text: Granted I haven't tasted all of the extra bold varieties yet, but I ordered the Coffee People "Jet Fuel" because of the user reviews. I agree wholeheartedly - Jet Fuel is the best tasting k-cup I've tasted thus far. The sample "dark" coffees that came with the Keurig coffee maker had me thinking I had made a mistake.<br /><br />I am a Starbucks expresso drinker usually. I have a really good Jura expresso maker, but it has been on the fritz, and starting the day without coffee is not an option. Thank you Coffee People for helping me start my day right :)

review/summary: Best K-Cup for Strong Coffee!
review/text: I am a coffee lover and have tried many K-Cup flavors/brands over the past few years.  My complaint is usually that the coffee is weak.  Not so with Jet Fuel - this stuff REALLY wakes you up.  Careful though!  More than one cup will send you through the roof.  I made the mistake of having two when I first ordered a box of Jet Fuel and found myself sweating and shaking a few hours later.  I find that Jet Fuel saves me money because I only have one cup and I am good to go.  Coffee People also makes "Wake-Up Call," which is another good, strong coffee.  It's a little less of a kick than Jet Fuel.  Both are very good.  Cheers!

review/summary: Best KCup
review/text: Of all the Kcups I've tried, this one fits me best.  It is the ONLY variety I've found that I don't have to reduce down to an espresso shot in order to get a strong cup of coffee.  I can make this in a normal size, and have a normal cup of coffee that still tastes strong.  I've had a few other people taste it who thought it was way too strong, so I gave them my leftovers from Coffee People Donut Shop, (which I found undrinkable).  Love this coffee.  It's the only one I order.

review/summary: Jet Fuel great but beware of packaging
review/text: I love my Keurig. I love Jet Fuel (second only to Parisian Nights). However, beware if you buy the 2 pack of 50 k cups. When I first ordered coffees (1 box at a time), I liked using the boxes as display with the k cups sitting neatly in their boxes as pictured. The second time I went ahead and ordered a 2 pack of 50 and they just shoved 50 k cups in a cardboard box. I have no way to display them and quite frankly do not have room for a tacky brown cardboard box full of free floating k cups. Other than that, this is a great coffee, but if you like to display the varieties using the boxes pictured on Amazon that they are supposed to come in...beware of buying more than one box. When I ordered these, I also ordered a 2 pack of Parisian Nights from Timothy's and they came in two separate boxes that I can put out for display. Why one would come appropriately and the other sent out ghetto style is beyond me.

review/summary: Love extra bold coffee, but this one tastes bitter
review/text: I've bought at least 10 different flavors and brands of extra bold k-cups and this is my least favorite.  The overwhelming flavor I get with this coffee is bitter.  I thought it might be an acquired taste so I gave it a few cups before making a final judgment.  I'm too cheap to throw it out, but I can't wait until it's gone.  I much prefer the Donut Shop and Black Tiger from Coffee People and Timothy's Midnight Magic.<br /><br />I am a big Coffee People fan too so this was quite disappointing for me.

review/summary: Jet fuel for a toy plane only
review/text: Was told this was a very strong bold coffee by a friend. I thought it was a medium to weak coffee, leaning towards the weak side with a bitter taste. Did not have that robust coffee taste. More like something I would get at a IHOP. My wife is a weak coffee drinker and she likes this. So this tells me I am right regarding my opinion on this coffee.<br /><br />I have pretty much gone through all the K-cups that are labeled "extra bold" and I keep coming back to the "EMERIL"S BIG EASY BOLD" K-Cups. I think I will stick with that from now on. The Emeril's Big Easy Bold has that great robust coffee taste without the bitterness. Just a great quality coffee.

review/summary: Freakishly Strong Coffee
review/text: If you are looking for a dark and insanely strong brew look no further.<br /><br />I had been hankering for a morning coffee to supplement the always enjoyable Coffee People Donut Shop.  Seeing as how it isn't a terribly dark brew I was looking for something else with a little more giddy up.  I tried both Coffee People's Extra Bold Wake Up Call and Timothy's Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso but neither quite hit the spot.  So I decided to give the Jet Fuel a try.  Hmmm...I might have overdone it.<br /><br />Honestly, I really do enjoy a strong cup of coffee, but try as I might (even went so far as to add cream, which I never do since I prefer my coffee dark and bitter like my life) I just couldn't stomach it.  I hate to knock a bunch of stars off a decent product just because I didn't like it, after all taste is opinion, this product appears slghtly flawed.  The coffee tasted a bit over roasted and that imparted not only bitterness, but quite a bit of acidity as well, that made it hard to stomach.<br /><br />Bottom line, great choice if you really want a freakishly strong (like, point your finger and cover your open mouth strong) cup of coffee to get you going.  However, definitely not a tame cup if that is what you're looking for.

review/summary: Avid Coffee Drinker, I Found THE PERFECT Brand
review/text: I will never go to Dunkin Donuts again. The flavor that this coffee gives is amazing. Usually, K-Cups from Green Mountain and other companies seem a bit too watery for a person that loves bold and strong coffee. This brand is just that - bold and strong without any bitterness. Every cup is perfect when pressing the 'Large' selection.<br /><br />There's not much else to say. If you love the bold taste of a strong brew from an old fashioned coffee brewer then look no further than Coffee People. I order this kind as well as the extra bold which is great too. No bitter, just bold and smooth!

review/text: I love a strong cup of coffee. My favorite is Green Mountain Double Black Diamond, but I tried these because they were significantly cheaper. I really like the taste of this K cup. My only complaint is that about every fifth cup or so, lots of grounds came out into the coffee. I have never had this problem with another brand. Since I couldn't drink those that had grounds in them, I really didn't end up saving as much money as I thought with this brand.

review/summary: Variety too limited and the price is ridiculous
review/text: Not only does this pack contain the regular varieties you can find at any broken down liquor store (like the one in the horror movies) and nothing else, but they package them FOR YOU.  Now, this is all well and good IF you're going to give a deal on them, which they do not.  3 packages for a buck? Please.  I'll limit my choices for a good price, or pay a good price for the freedom to choose, but I won't take a hit on both. And where are all the hard to find flavors? Koolaid is packaging these things all wrong.  Now, lemon-lime flavor happens to be my favorite.  So, I come on here looking to spend maybe 7 or so dollars for a bunch of them, BUT NO!  Look at the way these high-way robbers priced and packaged the things! There's no way in heck I'm about to spend 24 bucks for lemon-flavor AND be forced to spend a year drinking the same flavor.  It'll ruin my affection for the flavor and make me cranky.  The wife doesn't like it when I'm cranky.  I'm not married, but if I was, I'd be cranky and the wife wouldn't like it.  She'd probably divorce me for spending 24 bucks on one flavor of koolaid.  She'd say she needed more variety and didn't want to pay the high-price for it.  In summation....it's friggin powder and flavor, for crying out loud. Give us a break.

review/summary: Good variety and you can easily make it 0 cal with Splenda
review/text: As another reviewer has mentioned you can make this calorie free by using Splenda instead of sugar which is exactly what we do.  We always keep a pitcher of Kool Aid with Splenda in the fridge when you want something "sweet" but don't want to drink down a couple hundred calories.  It's a great guilt free way to satisfy that craving.<br /><br />For those reviewers saying the cost is too high:  Each packet makes about 64 oz.  64oz x 48 packets = 3072 oz.  By my math thats the equivalent of 153 20oz bottles of Diet Coke which would cost you over a hundred dollars.  Don't look it as 50 cents a pack but less then a penny a ounce and you'll realize its not a bad price at all.

review/summary: Candy  made in China?
review/text: This candy interested me - something different for trick or treat - because it was mentioned in an article in "People" magazine (I have written to the Editor of People).  We live on Harbour Island (Tampa), a neighborhood with many children, so it is fun to put forth an extra, creative effort each year. So I looked on-line and found these Fish Kabobs were available from a company through Amazon.  Amazon's products have always been well-packaged; sent on time; and to my satifaction.  What a surprise when I received these and found they are made in China!<br />Apparently, to send them back, it must be done through that seller - who has some odd practices.  The return postage had to be my responsibility (more than $10 sent the cheapest way); there is a 15% re-shelving fee!; and the man at TheOnlineCandyShop was nebulous as to the return address.  He thought it was on the package, but the one on the package was not right.  He gave me a different one, and I can only hope that is correct.<br />If I do receive a credit to my card, it will be very small at this point.  I was tempted to just throw the candies away.

review/text: The flavor is not outstanding, although it is a little better than the Hazelnut of this brand.<br /><br />Hard to believe that this brand is widely used (as the literature of the company claims).

review/text: What's not to like?  The top Irish chocolatier and Irish Cream truffles!  Yum! My wife and I toured Ireland last year, and I wanted to give her some Christmas gifts that would remind her of this very pleasant experience.  FWIW, if you're planning to go over, be sure to visit Derry and Belfast as well as the Republic.  The Irish-American Folk Museum in Ulster shouldn't be missed!

review/text: The cereal is amazing but this container is so awkward. If you want to eat from it, the bowl is really tall so when you put milk in it, the cereal overflows, and if you use only a little bit of milk and try to spoon the cereal from the bottom the cereal falls out because the container is too tall and thin and not wide :\

review/summary: Have a spot of tea !
review/text: I seem to have entered my green tea "wave".<br />After years of only black tea, then white, oolong and green tea, I have discovered the loose fruit flavored green tea mixes sold by Teavana, which are delightful. Teavana makes tea drinking a pleasure with all the available accoutrements and utensils.<br /><br />This green tea mix is flavored with apple pieces, hibiscus flowers, rosehip peels, blackberries, and blackberry flavoring, raspberries, plum pieces, cactus blossoms and spearmint and is called Blackberry Mojito.<br /><br />Fruitmixes are nothing new in the tea world, but Teavana's product is most fresh in the vacuum sealed pouches and has a wonderfully delicious fruity fragrance. However as an infusion, I found its slight astringent tartness somewhat objectionable, which most likely stems from the rosehips peel. Perhaps other people prefer this. If compared to the Lipton fruit flavored green and white tea bags, which are available now, and look like little pyramids, I have to say that I do prefer their taste, but as a potpourri Blackberry Mojito is the winner.

review/summary: missing link is A++++!!!
review/text: my cat began having digestive tract problems that my vet attributed to having a lack of fiber found in most cat foods. he also began having teeth & weight problems so she recommended increasing his intake of moist food, which have even less fiber than dry cat foods. i found this supplement at the petstore. i keep a measuring scoop in the bag & just mix it in w/his wet food, even my finicky other cat doesn't even notice the powder mixed in. there has never been a problem w/them getting sick from this supplement, like cat grass tends to make them puke, but it has improved both of their digestive tracts and makes me feel better about giving them more wet food since this adds the extra nutrients & fiber they need.

review/summary: Excellent addition to regular diet.
review/text: I started putting a small amount of this mixed into my 16 year old cat's canned food once a day after he got a bad virus.  A friend, whose cat had a serious blockage, had discovered this from a homeopathic vet in Manhattan.<br />After using this for many months, my cat is much stronger, brighter, has a fabulous silky coat, and no sign of illness. His energy has increased substantially.<br />I do not work for this company, by the way.

review/summary: A big mistake
review/text: I purchased this for my three cats, as a way to deal with hairballs and add some vitamins to their diet.  All of them are generally healthy, but this was recommended.  I'm really sorry that I spent the money.<br /><br />I followed the instructions, adding a small amount to their food for two days.  They did eat it; something that surprised me.  Usually they don't like anything different with their food.<br /><br />By the middle of the second day all three of the kitties were spending the majority of their time sleeping and trying to find dark places to hide.  They only do this when they are not feeling well.<br /><br />I stopped using the supplement and within another two days they were back to normal.  My cats are not overly sensitive, but this product really affected them badly.  I strongly suggest you use caution before adding this to your cat's diet.

review/text: Cardamom?!  Holy smokes!  So delicious, so different.  Try adding them to an affogato: vanilla ice cream, shot of espresso, cardamom bitters.  Mmmmm...  Of course, they're also great in whiskey cocktails.  Excellent quality, a better price for Scrappy's brand than I've seen in my local fancy-pants grocer, AND I've never seen Cardamom available anywhere else.  Just now discovered this product and love it!

They are great in lots of things, but the simplest is just shaking a little into ginger ale, it makes even cheap diet ginger ale taste amazing!<br /><br />I was put off by the price, but I am very glad that I purchased them!

review/summary: Chai Tea with Whipped Cream and Nutmeg
review/text: While you can make your own chai tea, it does take some work to gather all the spices and then steep them in milk. The Oregon Chai tea mixes are rather easy to use. You can either make regular tea and add the packet like you would milk and spices or you can serve this with hot milk or even just water.<br /><br />If you are looking for a very creamy version, you can make a 16-ounce cup of hot water in the microwave and then add one packet of Oregon Chai Tea Mix, 1 packet of hot chocolate and 2 Constant Comment tea bags. That is my favorite combination so far.<br /><br />While the tea packets are for an 8-ounce cup, I make a much larger cup of tea, so this is perfect to mix with a tea bag and more powdered milk.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, dried whole milk, dried nonfat milk, natural flavors, dried honey, tapioca maltodextrin, decaffeinated dried black tea and salt. Yes, salt!<br /><br />Each packet is 100 calories.<br /><br />Also look for Ready-to-drink individual servings and liquid concentrates where you just add milk.<br /><br />If you are just using a packet of this mix and 8 ounces of water, you might still want to add some powdered milk to make it extra creamy. Whipped cream and nutmeg also make the drink more delicious.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

It smells aweful and tastes even worse.  The initial out of bottle smell actually reminded me of alcohol/liquor.  The syrup is a complete and total disappoinment as well as a waste of money.  Amazon should be ashamed to sell this product.

review/summary: A Glitch in the system?
review/text: I ordered what I thought was five "4" packs of Smartbones medium size. What arrived was five "single" packs of the Smartbones medium size. The price for a four pack was a little more than half the local store price for the same items.... But for a single bone it works out to more than double the cost. I don't know if the problem is with the web/computer system or if the packer simply grabbed the wrong items. As I couldn't find a way to contact Amazon my only choice was to return the items. I'm afraid to reorder as I can't be certain the same mistake will not reoccur. Too bad as the price would be good and my dog loves the product.
