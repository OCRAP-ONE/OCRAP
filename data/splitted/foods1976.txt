review/summary: Good but not good enough to buy again for the price
review/text: My husband is a gummy candy fanatic. I had bought this in the hopes of finding a new brand he enjoyed but neither of us were all that thrilled with this one. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't horrible by any means and we did eventually finish the bag, but we didn't love it enough to want to pay $6 for more. If you want to try something new, I would definitely recommend this but I think you can find much cheaper gummy candy around that taste the same if not better.

review/summary: Yummy in my tummy!!
review/text: All of the Kosugai product are very high quality, the flavors are incredibly juicy and true to life, mainly because the actual fruit is a main ingredient, but its not anything like those 'fruit leathers' this is an actual candy, it is the closest thing to eating the actual fruit as it gets in terms of juiciness and flavor. I buy these all the time now, I love all the flavors, particularly the Mangosteen, Lychee, kiwi, and strawberry.

review/text: My young son is taking Chinese in school and wanted to take some Chinese candy into his class to share with the other students.  Kasugai Kiwi Gummy Candies was one of his choices.  When the order arrived we tried each of the different candies and the kiwi gummies were our favorite.  I almost didn't let him take them to school so I could keep them for myself.  They were a big hit with his class and sadly they were all consumed.  I guess I'll have to order more just for me.

review/summary: Orange is better than this and the lychee gummy
review/text: This has too subtle a flavor for a candy that is gone too fast.  I avoided these for a while because I thought they would be sticky, but they are not.  The kiwi seeds are a nice touch, but this flavor was boring for something that is gone so fast.  Orange is more intense for citrus lovers.  I really kept looking for the kiwi flavor.  Not horrible, but very subtle and subtle tastes better in a hard japanese candy to me.

review/text: After reading the other 2 reviews, I bought the pack of 4 cranberry orange no sugar biscotti, but they weren't at all what I was expecting-not crisp and light as most others are, but thick and like the biscuits my children used to teethe on!!  Yes, the taste is good, but certainly  one can make a regular biscotti tasty, crispy and still omit  the sugar. It takes a LOOONG dunking to get these soft.  I'll go with Nonni's biscotti any day from now on.

review/text: Love the Lyles! I purchased it in the past, and it was the same wonderful product inside the can. BUT.... the cans (I ordered 4) were severely dented! All of them. Unfortunately, one of them was a gift,so I had to sort thru to see which one was 'less' dented. What a shame! Whoever shipped them just threw them in the box taped it up, and off it went! Good thing the containers weren't glass! It seems there was a lack of care, and maybe a lack of pride in their product. Too bad I have to give such a poor review even tho the Lyles product was good.

review/text: I am a Crossfit athlete and have been taking chocolate superfood for about a year now. I mix 1 scoop with all natural whey protein powder after my workouts and 1 scoop with all natural casein protein powder before bedtime. I mix with water and rice milk at about a 50:50 ratio. I feel great and when I supplement this product with my protein shakes, I feel that I can recover faster since I'm getting more nutrients and antioxidants. Please don't change a thing about this product. My only complaint is that this product doesn't allow me to win the lottery and retire somewhere in the Caribbean.<br /><br />I also take the ORAC green superfood and mix with water with a little bit of apple juice. I take this on my non training days in the morning or on an ad hoc basis. This too is amazing especially when I feel that I'm getting sick. Or if I am sick, ORAC helps me recover faster. Its also a great hangover cure. 2 scoops of this stuff will get my day going and makes me believe I can drink like I was in college again.

review/text: This is the only food our 12 year old Rhodesian Ridgeback has ever eaten (plus a single square of Kraft American cheese daily as a treat and a few chicken breast treats.)  Kramer is in great health and people are always amazed at how fit and strong he is.  That he still has all his teeth is surely attributable to the Active Care hard kibble diet and the near absolute lack of any signs of arthritis must be one of the benefits of the "healthy joint formula."  Both Kramer and I cannot recommend Active Care highly enough.

review/summary: Greenies Pill Pockets - Chicken
review/text: One of our cats needs both a thyroid and a "happy pill" (anti-depressant) 2x a day.  Never had any problems - until just this month - blood work reported that we needed to adjust the thyroid dosage -- except the new dosage is not produced - so the vet called around to pharmacies who make compounds-to-order ... the new meds arrived - and when I saw the "capsule" instead of little tablet that we were used to I went on line to find out what others were doing to get capsules down kitties.  We found Greenies, ordered them and in the meantime bought a can of squeeze cheese until greenies arrived.... my cat likes both ... thankfully.  He isn't much of a chewer .. so that helps...<br /><br />We give him his 'happy pill' first (it is little) and then a few regular treats with one thyroid capsule tucked into a Greenie Pill Pocket... it has only been about 10 days .. but so far he is clueless .. he noses the treats around to find the Greenie FIRST, barely tastes it, swallows and eats his other couple of treats....<br /><br />Going to order some salmon and duck ones right now ....

Anyway, I let my cat smell the bag first and she seemed very interested. Then I gave her one empty pocket with no meds. She loved it. So, when the time came  was for her next pill, I gave her one pill pocket with the pill and a regular treat inside.  She ate it,no problem.<br />Now, I  temporary had to give her meds everyday and she is catching on. She eats the treat and spits out the pill!! I do not know what I am going to do. I guess I will have to force it on her by syringe. Maybe she will go back to taking the pill pocket...

I was nervous when he bit into it and figured here is where he tastes the icky pill and spits everything out. But NOPE! He ate all the bits! I gave him two empty pill pockets for being such a good boy. And he's worm free now. I hope these last awhile, because I only used 3 out of the whole bag.

review/summary: the joys of pilling a cat
review/text: Especially when you have to cut pills in half.  Greenies definitely make the task of getting those pills into cats a lot easier.  I've used them for cats who will voluntarily eat the whole pill and soft pill pocket all in one go, and to wrap the pill (the pill pockets are soft enough so that you can break them apart and 'wrap' around the pill, stretching out the pockets that way and making the whole 'pill package' a bit smaller) and pop it down the throats of those who unfortunately seem to figure out that there's something in the tasty treat (often by chewing on the pockets) and saving them the taste of the pill (great for cut pills or any meds that can produce a foaming/drooling effect).  Anything that makes 'medicine time' less of a stressful time for anything involved is a wonderful invention.

review/text: When my cat was diagnosed with high thyroid, he was destined to take pills daily for the rest of his life, at least 5 more years.  I told the vet that if I had to give him 2 pills a day, the cat would hate me...Adric hates taking medicines of any kind.  It becomes a "I chase you around the house until I trap you in a room then corner you, wrestle a pill into your mouth, then hold you while you gag, then when I think you've swallowed it, I let you go and you cough up the pill" kind of situation.<br /><br />Then the vet told me about these pill pockets.  I use two pockets a day as Adric has to take a half pill morning and night.  So far, so great!  He happily chases the treat with the pill inside, chews it up, and swallows it.  I could see using these for the rest of his life.  He actually comes running when I shake the pill bottle and sits and waits at my feet.<br /><br />The amazon price is far better than my local pet store, and with free shipping, what's not to love?<br /><br />If my cat tires of these, I'll report back in the future, but for now, he's one healthy happy cat again.<br /><br />Note: I also purchased the chicken pockets, but haven't tried them yet.

review/summary: My Cat Loves Them
review/text: My cat was extremely difficult to get pills into, I tried these and now the second I wake up I'm called over to the 'pill spot' by an impatient kitty.  I have two cats, one doesn't take any meds and I was tired of the sad looks when the other got his treat every morning.  Now I give them each a treat.  One likes the salmon and the other likes chicken.  If your cat(s) won't touch it, try the other flavor.  As others have said, if your cat is really picky it's best to use one hand to deposit the pill and the other to pinch the treat shut so they can't smell the pill on the outside of the treat, but it's never been an issue for mine.

review/summary: A Super Product
review/text: I have an 11 year old cat who was just diagnosed with hyperthyroidism.  Basically he will have to take a pill twice a day for the rest of his life.  Have you ever tried to PILL A CAT???  Unless he is super laid back it's quite a challenge.  These little 'pockets' work like a dream.  Just pop the pill in the soft pocket, squeeze the top shut and there you go.  I put the pocket on the floor along with other soft treats so Alfie just eats them all up. He is totally in love with the pocket 'treat'.  Such a great idea.  They have them for dogs also...

review/summary: doesn't work for all cats
review/text: This is a great idea for giving pills to cats. I am sure that this works wonderfully with cats who love dry treats. My own cat doesn't like dry treats like temptations etc. I think its the smell because she eats her regular dry food but not the dry treat. Go figure. So it didn't work with my cat. Instead I crush her pills(please check with your vet first before doing this) and mix them with wet food. I tried giving these pill pockets as treats to my cat, but she still won't eat them.

review/summary: Worthy of a Nobel Prize
review/text: OK, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but these have made pilling my cats something that they actually look forward to, rather than an ordeal that ends up with one of us being mad, and the other with scratches. Just put the pill in the pouch, pinch it shut, and offer it as a treat. Done! She snarfs it down and looks for more.<br /><br />It works great with one of my cats who is the most difficult to pill (and, of course, the she's the one that needs 2 pills a day for her thyroid problem). It does not work as well for another cat - I tried both the chicken and the fish flavors with her, and she didn't care much for either. Fortunately, she's pretty easy to pill using a pill gun.<br /><br />If your cat like soft treats, chances are he/she will like these. If so, and you want the easiest pilling process possible, get these. Amazon charges less than half what my vet office charges, and also offers them in a 6-pack at an even lower per pouch cost. Highly recommend!

review/summary: Great idea, but my cats hated them
review/text: I think these are a great idea - hiding pills inside a tasty little ball of gooey chicken tasting stuff.  Because I could get them with free shipping via Amazon's Supersaver shipping (for orders over $25) I decided to try them.  We have two indoor house cats and two outdoor barn cats, and I worm them quarterly.  Usually I have to grind up their pills and hide the powder in wet food.  I tried liquid wormer but they could smell it in the food and wouldn't eat it.<br /><br />So, the Greenies arrived and I fixed one for each cat.  One cat smelled it a long time, but wouldn't eat it despite my pleading.  Two of them gave the Greenie a quick sniff and backed away after giving me a dirty look.  The fourth cat actually hissed at me when I offered it to her.  She's not the friendliest cat to begin with, but she usually takes treats from my hand.  The overall opinion from the cats seems to be "yeah, right!  Nice try!"<br /><br />Maybe the salmon flavor would be a better choice, but I don't think I'll spend the money to find out.  I'm giving three stars because it's a great idea, but if the cats won't eat them I'm back to the drawing board.

review/summary: Does the trick for my cat
review/text: My cat is on a daily dose of Prozac due to anxiety and territorial issues, and the vet said that we should try these pill pockets as a way to easily give him medication without having to chase him around the house and cram a pill down his throat (only to have him spit it up later). He eats these like "treats" and has even ripped through the bag to eat the pill pockets sans medicine. These definitely are worth trying if you need to give your cat some pills. Also, the price on Amazon is great compared to my local pet stores.

review/summary: Life Saver for our CRF Cat
review/text: Our cat of 15 years was just recently diagnosed with Kidney Failure.<br /><br />Among the other things the vet prescribed to help her is a daily dose of Pepcid and an appetite stimulant which she takes every 3 days. She's not allowed to have a lot of protein (part of kidney failure), but the vet advised a little would be OK to disguise her pills in a small bit of food. We tried everything to get her to take the pills - tuna, cream cheese, regular cheese, cream, whipped cream, ham, turkey, baby food, etc. Although she usually loves all of these things (she comes running when we shake the whipped cream can!), she would not touch them when the pill was mixed in. We tried adding the pills whole as well as crushing and mixing them. No go.<br /><br />The vet suggested force-feeding her the pills. This includes wrapping her up in a towel while my husband forces her to open her jaw and throws the pill in while. I shoot a syringe full of water in forcing her to swallow the pill. Sounds pretty straight forward, but its not. Not to mention its stressful on us all. When we were finally able to get the pill in her mouth it actually started foaming!<br /><br />Needless to say, we were very frustrated and didn't know what to do. Then we found these. She loves them and hasn't even noticed the pill. We purchased both the Chicken and Salmon in case she gets bored of one flavor. We're crossing our fingers that she doesn't wise up. But they have literally been a life-saver!  Thank you Greenies!

review/summary: My cat and I are thankful...
review/text: Our cat is a 17 year old with thyroid and kidney issues.  He has to have his thyroid pills 3 times a day.  He used to eat them crushed in a small helping of Friskies Appetizers (tuna or salmon) which he ate dependably... but lately he'd become picky and not interested in the Appetizers any more.  We'd gotten to where we were doing the "gently pinch the jaw and shove the pill back" routine which neither of us liked.<br /><br />These pill pockets make getting him his meds easy and pleasant, and we're both happy not to have the thrice-daily confrontations.  It's a soft treat in the shape of a small cylinder with the top missing- tuck the pill in, pinch it closed, roll it around to make a ball and it's set.  We have used the salmon flavor successfully, and will be trying the chicken soon.<br /><br />To folks who find the cat is eating around the pill or can detect it... if the pill can be cut in half, do that and give two treats, a half in each.  (Check with your vet to be sure it doesn't affect the drug's delivery since some meds have a time release coating.)  Whoever thought of these was a genius.

review/summary: Amazing & Easy Way to Give Cats Pills!!
review/text: I purchased this item at a local pet store when I was on my way to the Vet to pick up some medications for one of my cats. One of the medications was a liquid, and the other was a pill, not a capsule. I was instructed to give my cat, Loki, half a pill every 12 hours.<br /><br />I gave Loki his liquid antibiotic first, and then followed it with a Pill Pocket that contained his medication. He had no idea that the pill was even inside the treat!! He gobbled the Pill Pocket down and looked at me expecting more Pill Pocket Treats. I have continued to follow his liquid antibiotic with his pill medication in a Pill Pocket as a "reward" for taking the liquid antibiotic.<br /><br />Loki is getting smarter about the Pill Pocket Treats, even though I only started his medications recently. To get around him sniffing the Pill Pocket and turning his nose up at it, I put other treats that he loves on the floor and put the Pill Pocket among them. He scarfs them all down, Pill Pocket included!<br /><br />One problem I had (that the Pill Pocket ended up solving), was the pill medication. The pill had a chalky consistency, and when cut, did separate cleanly into two halves. So sometimes I would end up with pill dust that would have to be halved and somehow inserted into a Pill Pocket. The Pill Pockets have a play-dohy consistency, and using this to my advantage, I flattened one Pill Pocket out and gently molded it into a bowl-like shape. I put the pill dust into the Pill Pocket bowl shape I had made, and then flattened a second Pill Pocket. I placed the second flat pill pocket over the top of the bowl-shaped Pill Pocket and squished them together, making one slightly larger Pill Pocket.<br /><br />Now, when Loki is called, he comes running into the kitchen for his Pill Pocket. And, since I'm sometimes forgetful, he'll come and get me, meowing until he gets his Pill Pocket (and medication).<br /><br />Pill Pockets are an easy way to get your cat(s) to take medications and are very versatile (as they are somewhat mold-able) to accommodate the type of medication (Pill or Capsule).

review/summary: My cat looks forward to taking her medicine!
review/text: My cat was put on prednisolone for the next month, and for a week or two I was crushing her pill and mixing it with cat food every morning. To save some time, I decided to try these pill pockets out to see if they worked. Turns out that it worked perfectly! The pill is oval, so I squish the treat until it completely covers the pill, and give the pill to my cat while the other gets a regular treat. They both happily eat their treats, and I follow up with a regular Greenies treat to make sure that the entire pill has been taken.<br /><br />My vet's office originally suggested a pill shooter as a way to give her the pill if she had trouble -- I'm so glad to know that taking her medicine is now a happy experience for my cat, rather than a traumatic daily occurrence!

review/text: I have to give my cat pills every twice a day.  It was a real chore for her and for me before I discovered pill pockets.  She loves them.  They are moist and you can wrap the pill pocket around the pill so there is no pill taste or smell.  I usually divide both the pill and the pill pocket in half so it is a smaller package, and she doesn't bite into the pill and pull it out.  She loves both the salmon and the chicken flavors.  I haven't tried the beef flavor, yet.

They do make a chicken flavor too but I wish they made more. Cats are so fussy.....

Some of the pockets are too small so I put those in a baggie and mold them together to make bigger pockets. Others I use as is. Just make sure the pill isn't showing anywhere or the cat will spit it out. My cat did that once; ate the pocket and I found the pill on the floor. My fault. Now I make sure the pill is fully covered everywhere and it never happened again. I am so grateful for this product!!! I have to pill my cat twice a day for hyperthyroidism. She hated it! We had to shove it down her throat. I felt just horrible. This is so much better. No more stress for any of us and my cat thinks she gets a treat twice a day now instead of being tortured. She likes the chicken and duck flavors too.

The thought of this terrified me, as my cat doesn't even like to be held for longer than ten seconds, much less have a pill shoved down her throat. I decided to try these without much hope for success, but they work like a dream! I put the pill inside the treat in a different room with the door closed, and am VERY careful not to touch the pill and treat with the same hand. My cat is pretty greedy and will eat anything, and she gobbles her pill down without even noticing! SUCH A RELIEF!!!!

review/summary: Highly Recommend!
review/text: One of my cats had to go on antibiotics for two weeks, and the vet offered "pill pockets" to hide the pills.  I chose the salmon flavor over chicken, as he prefers fish.  The vet also recommended first giving him a couple without pills inside as treats, which I did.<br /><br />The third one had his first pill hidden inside, and it worked like a charm.  Haven't had a problem at all, except his sister wants to partake as well, so I give her empty pill pockets from time to time.<br /><br />The vet charged $6.50 for a bag of 45 pill pockets - much less expensive on Amazon.com.

review/text: This product has been a tremendous help in giving pills to my elderly cat. He is a pill detective and knows whenever you try to hide pills mixed in his everyday food or powdered versions mixed into his wet food. In the past, I ended up just doing it the hard way and struggled to get him to swallow it straight. I purchased the Greenies reluctantly and was pleasantly surprised when he gobbled up the treat with the pill inside. No more problems with giving him his pills! He is happy to have his treat and I'm happy not to struggle with him in giving him his medication.

review/text: The Pill Pockets seemed like a good idea, and maybe they are, but they only fooled my cat, Bonnie, for the first three or four times. After that she just ate some of the treat and left the pill, or avoided it altogether. She was never a lover of treats anyway, so maybe they'll work better on a cat who is.

review/summary: Made recovery much less stressful
review/text: My cat recently had surgery and had to take a course of antibiotic pills. I was dreading the idea because he's a difficult cat to pill, and I didn't want to add more stress on him during recovery, but these treats made the whole process easy. I gave him a few without pills in them first just to make sure he'd eat them and to get him used to them. I never had any issues getting him to eat them with the pill in them. (I cut the pill in half and gave him two pill pockets at a time, since the pill was on the larger side.) It might also help to not give your cat or pet any food for a few hours before you administer the pill, so they're hungry enough to be less picky about it. I'll absolutely use these again in the future if the need should arise.

review/summary: What a Great Product!
review/text: When my vet prescribed Prednisone for my cat's allergies, she gave me a few Chicken flavor Pill Pockets to try on my once-feral cat.  She suggested the treats be hidden in the cat's canned food. I was skeptical, having suffered through decades of cats spitting pills out, trying to bite me while I held them down, finding and eating around pills hidden in food, and foaming at the mouth while being pilled.  Pill poppers helped a lot, but they traumatized the poor kitty.<br />After two days of "tough love" hold-the-cat-down-and-force-the-pill-in, she was becoming afraid of me.  So I tried the Pill Pocket sample, figuring it couldn't hurt.  I hid it in her canned food breakfast bowl, and she inhaled every bite of food.  Pill and pocket gone!  She has taken all her pills since I began using the Pill Pockets, and her allergies are 90% better.<br />As the Predisone pills are very small, I am able to cover them comletely with the Pill Pocket.  And I think it helps a lot to put the pill/treat in wet food.

review/text: These treats are a great little invention! Our very energetic 1 year old kitty named Harley Quinn was absolutely not allowing us to give her liquid medicine, and forget pills! We did some research and came across these pill pockets, and boy do they do the trick! She actually comes and waits expectantly for her little pill treat twice a day. I never thought I'd see the day a cat would want medicine!<br /><br />I love this product and whole-heartedly recommend!<br /><br />NOTE: I use needle-nosed pliers to insert the pill into the pill pocket, then seal it nice and tight. I never let the pill touch my hands nor the outside of the treat, so no pill scent is left behind.

review/summary: Worth their weight in gold
review/text: Imagine my horror on learning that each of two my cats would need a tablet every day for 21 days! Luckily, our vet suggested these pill pockets. I was skeptical, but the darn things work.<br /><br />The pockets come in a bag very similar to their regular cat treats, and apparently the flavor is appealing too. Both cats beg for them and gobble them up, totally unaware they just ate medicine. It's only day three, so I hope I'm not jinxing myself, but that's six times so far that we haven't had to force a cat to swallow medicine--well worth the cost already. My hands, arms and nerves are grateful!<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD: The 21-day regimen is over and neither cat balked ONCE at eating their "special treats." I am SO GLAD we bought them! I will buy these again any time I have to give a pill to a cat.

review/summary: These things miraculous!
review/text: This relatively simple innovation has absolutely saved the tender relationship I have with my cat.  As she was recently diagnosed asthmatic, I am now forced to administer up to 2 prednisone pills to my incredibly finicky, active and resistant 7yo Bombay mix.  Before I found these I was struggling with the "pill popper"; even when that gadget successfully hit the target, I was forced to watch her foam vehemently at the mouth when the easily-dissolved and extremely bitter pill it launched hit any part of her tongue or back of her mouth, forcing her to choke - not to mention battling the scratches from the pour soul who thought her mom was poisoning her with this awful medicine.  Amazingly she liked both flavors of these pockets, and now gobbles them down - pills safely tucked inside - without so much as a shake of her head.  I'm forever grateful to Greenies for coming up with this great product - they have saved me years more of struggles with a cat forced to take daily pills!

review/summary: Cat loves them!
review/text: Our cat is currently on medication twice a day.  In the past we had tried giving her pills manually but it was a two person job and very unpleasant for us and for the cat.  Our vet recommended this produt and using the pill pockets has made medicating her a breeze!  She comes running when she hears us getting out the package and gobbles the pill pocket and pill right up!  For her they just seem to be delicious cat treats.  One caution, a few times we have handled the pill pockets too much (once I tried rolling it in a ball) and it seems to make it too compact/sticky.  Those times she had a hard time chewing the pill pocket, it seemed to stick in her month (sort of like peanut butter can stick in a human mouth).  She did eventually get it eaten.  If we put in the pill and pinch it closed (as the instructions say), she can eat them very easily.  We don't know what we would do without these and buying them through Amazon is cheaper than through the vet.

It's not obvious when you order, but there are two sizes of pill pockets, and this is the smaller size (size of the pocket, not just quantity).

My cat loves the treat, sniffs the air when the bag is opened and gobbles it all up.  The vet said that if the cat gets sneaky and can separate out the pill, you should crush up the pill and pour into the pocket.  I only wish these were invented years earlier, I can't even fathom all the scratches and hisses I would have avoided from previous cats.<br />Also, how great for a cat sitter or someone less interested (err, willing) to stick their hands in an angry cats jaws!<br />A fantastic fantastic product that anyone with a cat who needs meds should have!

review/summary: Life saver - so far
review/text: So far we love this product. Some of the reviews have me a little worried that it won't last forever but it has literally been a lifesaver for our cat.  She has always been very territorial to the point of always staying in the room when anyone is around and hissing and swatting at people who try to touch her or get too close.  Our basement door was left open just a crack and a neighbor's cat came in.  Our cat would not go downstairs, she just looked through her pet door and they screeched and yowled at each other but our cat was totally over the edge after that.  We couldn't get near her; she growled and hissed all the time.  We have grandchildren and we really were considering having her put down.  My husband loves her so much and she is only two and a half years old so we didn't want to do that.  The vet put her on Prozac but we couldn't get it down her.  It was hard enough anyway but with her in the agressive mode, it was impossible.  The Pill Pockets made all the difference.  She swallowed it down in a second and wanted more. She is just upset that she doesn't get more than one treat a day.  She has always loved chicken but we will try another flavor if she gets tired of this one. She has had a habit of getting bored with different types of treats after a few months so we hope this doesn't happen with this one. The last two days it has taken two treats to get it down her. I'm not sure if my husband isn't putting them in right or if she has figured out that if the pill pops out she will get another treat.  We've only been doing this a week and we just hope this keeps on working because if we are not able to continue giving her the medication, she has to find another home or be put down.  By the way, the medication works great in case anyone has a cat or dog that has problems of some sort. Considering the other treatments and prices of raising animals, I was happy to find the price on these. I would not call them pricey considering they only eat one a day and it gets the pill down the cat.

review/text: I bought this brand from Amazon (salmon flavor) and they are absolutely wonderful for me and for my kitty who gets daily pills.  I pinch off a bit of a pill pocket and mould it around the pill (use just enough to coat the pill completely), pop it in the back of her throat and it's gone.  Pill Pockets are about the consistency of children's modeling clay, stick to the pill but not to your fingers, and slide nicely down kitty's throat.  I won't try to tell you my cat enjoys me prying her little jaws open but she doesn't struggle anymore, she doesn't have to endure that bitterness, and I don't feel like a horrible meowmie.

review/summary: Mixed results, and some tips
review/text: I have three older cats who take arthritis pills.  One also takes a thyroid pill.  I decided to try the pill pockets.  For the first month or so, they all loved them, and they made it easy to give the pills.  However, after three months:<br /><br />One cat still loves them.  I have to watch her carefully or she will steal the pills from the others.<br /><br />One cat has figured out how to eat around the pill.<br /><br />One cat sometimes takes them, but at other times just sniffs the pocket and skips it.<br /><br />I have figured out a few tricks that help:<br /><br />There are two types of pockets for cats:  chicken and salmon.  The chicken is slightly larger and more pliable and works better with larger pills.  However, I think that the cats find the salmon tastier.<br /><br />Get another cat treat and stick it to the side of the pill pocket.  Then place the pocket so the treat faces down.  My finicky cat is much more likely to eat the whole thing that way.<br /><br />The pill pocket still helps with the cat who eats around it.  After she eats the pill pocket, it is easier to shove the pill down her throat.  She is more likely to swallow it instead of spitting it out if it tastes of pill pocket.<br /><br />If you have two pills, try to fit them both in one pocket.  Giving the cat fewer pockets will make it seem more of a treat.

review/summary: Great Idea That Works Well Until Your Cat Outsmarts You
review/text: I have two cats, one is mine and the other is my girlfriends. My cat, although he isn't thrilled with getting the occasional "tummy pill," does do pretty well with them and doesn't usually throw too bad of a fit. My girlfriend's cat on the other hand, is quite the opposite. That little bugger will throw one of the biggest fits you ever seen when you attempt to give him a pill. You would think that we are trying to give him a bath he throws such a fit, which is another story all together!<br /><br />Anyhow, we bought some of these "pill hiding treats" in an attempt to get him to take his medicine without the daily fight that is usually attached to the act of pill taking. The very first time we tried them we were both a bit apprehensive wondering if we had just wasted some money on treats instead of the normal band-aids which come in quite handy at pill time. Needless to say, these "pill pockets" worked!<br /><br />We were literally amazed the first time that we gave him one with a pill in it and he actually gulped it down without even tasting it. Oh, what joy swept through our household. Little did we know that it was only going to last about 2 weeks. Just enough time for use to become complacent as far as the daily pill act was concerned.<br /><br />Sure enough, we were once again outsmarted by the cat. Approximately two weeks into the "pill hiding treat" debacle, we started finding his pill on the floor but no sign of the pill pocket. We soon discovered that the little bugger was chewing the pill pocket off from around the pill and eating it without eating the pill.<br /><br />Now we give him several "pill hiding treats" throughout the day, and only one of them has the pill in it, but he never knows which one it is. Although we never put it in the very first one, or the very last one. This has been working now for about a month, but I figure were running out of time on this one and had better start thinking up a new plan of attack before we are once again outsmarted by the cat.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Cat Lover

review/summary: Makes life easier but a word of caution
review/text: So glad I got these. My cat is on a motility agent and I dreaded giving him the pills remembering the nightmare it was last year when I had to give him antibiotics for a month. With these it's no sweat. He gobbles it up. So much so that he begs for them. Today I got home and he'd managed to get the whole bag off the shelf he normally doesn't reach and tore up the bag and ate them all (more than 30 of them were left). I cringed at the thought of what would have happened if I'd decided to prefill the pockets with the meds. It would have been a tragedy - he would have overdosed and died. Thank goodness I had the instinct not to do that. So word of advice is do never prefill the treats in bulk. No matter how safe you think your storage place is.

review/text: ...and I did.  My cat was diagnosed with asthma and it was then that it became necessary to pill him daily.  He was feral his first year of life so pilling has always been impossible, especially since I have no one to help me with the whole process.  Thanks to pill pockets, I have kept him alive and his asthma under control by myself, without adding to his condition due to stress (a common asthma trigger) from forced pilling.  I've heard that some cats don't go for these treats, but my two boys gobble them up, pill and all.  I'm not sure what I would have tried next if these hadn't worked.  If you've had trouble pilling and you've run out of ideas, they are definitely worth a shot.  Of course, if your cat is super smart and knows how to spit out pills, the treats, in and of themselves, are still great snacks!

review/summary: A great way to fool the cats (sometimes)
review/text: I bought these about a month ago because we have a few cats that we occasionally have to give pills.  It worked for 2 of the cats but the other seemed to sense that something was "fishy" about these things and wouldn't touch them.  But for the other two cats they worked great.<br /><br />They are like a semi-moist cat food, but more moist and pliable.  There's a little indentation in the middle and you just push the pill inside and squeeze it together.  The cats seem to pretty much swallow it whole, or if they do chew it, don't notice the pill inside.  If it were a very  bitter pill I probably wouldn't use these since they'd probably be able to taste it.  Anything that gets medication down even 2 of the cats without a struggle is a success as far as I'm concerned.

review/summary: My cat's too smart
review/text: Pill pockets worked twice with my cat.  On the third night my cat bit into a piece of an antibiotic and wouldn't touch them after that. I tried cutting the pill into smaller pieces. I tried smashing one of his regular treats into the pill pocket.  I tried the chicken flavor of pill pocket.  No go. I'm having much better luck with a "pill gun." It looks something like a hypodermic. I can get the pill to the back of his throat so he has to swallow it. I usually get it on the first try. If your cat licks his nose, that's a sign that he's swallowed the pill.  My vet taught me that.

review/summary: AWESOME product!
review/text: Every so often you try a product and wonder, "why did it take forever for someone to invent these?" Well, this is that product!  If you've ever had the joy of having fangs come down on your hand while giving medication to a cat, well, try these!  These things are one of "those" products that everyone should know about.  My cat has to be on medication for the rest of his life and these things are a true God send.  He LOVES them and never knows there's a pill inside of them.  They have a hole in the center, you place your pill in there, then seal it up, feed it to your cat.  They just think they are getting a treat, not a pill.  It's the consistency of cookie dough so it's like putting a pill in cookie dough and squishing it together.  I just LOVE these things and so does my cat. He already loved the regular Greenies treats and well, this was an obvious solution.  HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Great price here too on amazon with the buy 4 get one free thing. Made it cheaper than my local store and WAY cheaper that the vet!

review/summary: The worst part of my cat's day is now the best!
review/text: I have struggled for over a year and a half in giving my cat a daily pill.  She foams and vomits easily and she and I both dread this daily torture. I have tried to bury the pill in every treat and delicious food I could think of, including raw liver, but as soon as she smelled the pill (which has a disgusting bitter taste, the vet says), she wouldn't try anything.  But this week I tried the chicken-flavored pill pocket, and my cat just about stood on my head to get it out of my hand so she could eat it.  She goes absolutely nuts for it and doesn't detect her pill at all.  The worst part of my cat's day (the worst part of my day, too) is now great! I recommend this stuff highly.<br /><br />Note: After a few weeks, my cat decided she no longer liked the chicken flavor, but continues to eat the salmon flavor one. But sometimes she won't eat it unless I wrap some small cat treats on it like a sandwich. You don't need to use the entire pill pocket for small pills - I pinch off what I need, and so the bag lasts a long longer than usual.

review/summary: Pill Pockets - some tricks
review/text: I used these when my cat had to take antibiotic pills for an upper respiratory infection.  They worked well, but I learned a couple of things:<br /><br />1. Feed him the pill pockets alone a couple of times.<br /><br />2. VERY IMPORTANT - Use one hand for the pill and the other for the pocket, and never let them touch.  I accidentally let the pill hand touch the pocket and he wouldn't eat it because he smelled the pill.<br /><br />The pill pockets were much easier than trying to pill and then squirt water into the cat.

review/summary: Veterinary approved for dogs. Still mixed about cats...
review/text: As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets.  I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling.<br /><br />Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those "duh" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent.  Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least.<br />My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of "treat."  It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it "makes pills a treat to give!"<br /><br />The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger "capsule" dog Pill Pockets.<br /><br />The cons:  One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help. But anything for Fido, right?!<br /><br />For dogs, 5 stars. For cats, I'm only giving 3 stars, as only one of my two cats will eat them!<br /><br />Dr. Justine Lee, DVM, DACVECC<br />Author of "It's a Dog's Life... but It's Your Carpet" and "It's a Cat's World...

review/summary: It really works!!
review/text: Kelsey is 18 years old just developed hyperthroidism and has to have a pill every day for the rest of her life.  Well she is extremely closed mouth and it is very hard to even get her mouth open.<br /><br />So I heard about the pill pockets read your reviews on here picked up her medication at the vets yesterday and stopped at PetsMart and purchased the pocket, chicken flavor.<br /><br />First I gave her one without the pill... she loved it and thought it was a treat and looked at me for more.  I then took another and put in the pill and pinched it close and she gobbled it up.  YEA!!!!!!<br /><br />Kelsy only has 2 teeth and eats only soft food.  This pocket is soft enough and she has no problems getting it down.<br /><br />Another up side is when we go on vacation my sons comes and feeds her.  He could have never have gotten a pill down her.  He watched me give her her pill and he said Wow, I can do that!<br /><br />Also since Kelsey is old, as much as I love her I could not afford the operation or the radioactive pill.  So this works great.<br /><br />Thank you for your reviews.<br /><br />A+++++++++<br /><br />Next I will try the salmon.<br /><br />Oh there is one bad thing... and that us she wants more than one... lol<br /><br />Maryanne & Kelsey

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I actually haven't used these on my very finicky cat, but they worked marvelously with two of my other cats and my Border Collie.  My Border Collie was prescribed antibiotics twice a day for ten days as well as another very large pill for four days.  We've tried treats (they crumble), peanut butter, wet food, and anything else we could think of when trying to give her heartworm medication.  Nothing worked!  She would lick all the good stuff off and then spit the pill back out.  I had just ordered these pill pockets for my cats when the meds were prescribed for my Border Collie and thought I'd try them out.  She took her medicine every day with no problem! I was amazed!  I used one pill pocket for the smaller pill and two for the larger one, molding them around the pills.  She gobbled them up every time.  I will absolutely be ordering more when these are used up.
