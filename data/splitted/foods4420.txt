review/summary: Old chocolate.  Be wary buying.
review/text: I went with this because I couldn't find any chocolate cups in my area on short notice for a wine themed gift I was putting together.  Although my biggest initial fear was that they would come shattered into a million pieces, every cup was intact.  Unfortunately, about 3/4 of the chocolate cups in the box where covered in white spots.  Clearly, old chocolate.  Pretty frustrating that the company can't adhere to any kind of expiration policy and is passing off nasty chocolate like this with a potential to make someone pretty sick if they were less discerning, or had never encountered spoiling chocolate before.

review/summary: Nuts for Peanuts
review/text: I love these peanuts. I cannot find them locally, so I shop at my "go to store" Amazon. They are not flame throwing hot. For me the heat is just right. If you like food with a bit of a kick and you like peanuts, I expect that you will like these. Sliced bread is the greatest thing since Amazon.... LOL

review/summary: Best cheddar ever!
review/text: This cheese is the most amazing cheddar I have ever eaten.  It has a strong, rich flavor without the aftertaste most extra sharp has.  I don't even eat extra sharp cheddar as a rule.  I bought this for my husband and when he had me try it I was sold immediately. It is great by itself with crackers or melted on sandwiches.  It is also good in an omelet or BBQ Chicken sandwich.  I love this cheese!  Try it, you'll love it!

review/summary: Hands down best cheese ever, and I've eaten alot of cheese.
review/text: I cant begin to tell you how good this is. Wife works for Trader Joes and we have tried every cheese they have ever sold over the last 10 years. Trader Joes used to carry a black wax gouda that was on this level, but they they quit selling that particular brand. We have not found another cheese until now that even compared (and I know this cheese isnt a gouda) but its on that level of "doesnt matter what kind" its freaking good. Also, TJ's current black wax gouda is not comprable.<br />This stuff is so good.... I was forced to look for it online and write a review (which I have never done on amazon that I can recall).

review/summary: Tastes like a pumpkin spice latte!
review/text: Found this flavor at Bed Bath and Beyond.  I'm not one for teas, usually, but the Tassimo has opened a whole new world of tea-drinking to me.  I decided to be a little adventurous and try this one out.<br /><br />I enjoyed this flavor quite a bit...  like most Tassimo flavors using their ultra-pasteurized 2% milk pods, you'll either love or hate the drink because of the milk.  Also, I have a real sweet tooth and this drink did not disappoint in that regard, though it might be too sweet for a lot of people.  Cloves and cardamom are well-represented in this drink, though the cinnamon and ginger were a little overpowered by the sweetener and the milk.  To me, it smells and tastes a lot like a pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks, only sweeter and less bitter (yes I know one is tea and the other is espresso).<br /><br />For those of you terrified of sucralose (SPLENDA), you should know the tea contain it as a sweetener.  I personally don't buy into all the paranoia, but I just thought I'd throw that in.  My girlfriend is a self-professed "Splenda detector" and hates it, but she didn't notice.<br /><br />For those of you having trouble with grounds in your drink, try changing your piercing mechanism?  The piece can be replaced for $9.99 on the Tassimo website.  ... Just my suggestion.

review/summary: Low Calorie, Low Carb, Great Taste!
review/text: Reading the reviews reveals everybody likes something different in their Chai tea lattes.  I, too, was a regular at Starbucks, until I found out how many calories each one of those lattes was costing me!  For those who don't like Splenda, I can understand why you might be a bit concerned about that sweetener being used in this drink, however, Splenda is one of the few sweeteners that hasn't been found to be harmful to one's health.<br /><br />The biggest benefit to drinking the chai tea latte (IMO) is the fact that it's only 7 grams of carbs and 80 calories per serving!  You can't beat that.  It is a bit sweet, however, they make 'em that way at Starbucks too, and it definitely satisfies my sweet tooth.  I will definitely be ordering this tea again when my current two packages run out!

I for one can taste it in the tea and could tell even before reading the ingredients.  Unfortunately, I should have read the ingredients before purchasing.  I wish they would leave it out and let the buyer sweeten the beverage with what we desire to put into our bodies.  I am chemically sensitive to sucralose or SPLENDA and/or Nutrasweet so now I cannot drink this particular tea. :(

review/text: It's a nice cup of chai...is it the best or does it taste like what you get from Starbucks or other coffee/tea houses, No... but if you are looking for decent "copy-cat", than this is it! Yes, there is an artificial sweetner that is used in it, so if you are sensitive to that or just don't like the taste (I would say it mimicks the taste of Equal more than Splenda) of the fake sweetners than this tea is NOT for you. The spices are on point and the addition of either the milk disc or your own half and half makes it even more delicious! I use the fat-free milk discs that come with the Skinny Cappuccinos and it is perfect! If I want something a little richer, than I use a regualr milk disc or add my own half and half.

review/text: I bought my Tassimo system on ebay and I was disappointed that the girl I bought it from only had 4 boxes of tea lattes to send with it.  I wanted coffee lattes.  I drank a whole box in one day.  The tea is rich and sweet in flavor, so those who like sugar as I do won't have to add any.  It's just yummy to me.  I have no idea why anyone wouldn't like it.  To each his own, I guess.  But honestly it's better than the coffee latte, to me.

I have had better Chai tea from a teabag, which cost much less!!!!!  Unless you are hooked on gadgets and don't have time to microwave a cup of water for tea, save your money and buy a good Chai tea mix and milk.  The latte disc didn't foam up very much at all, so I was left with a cup of mediocre Chai tea with a lot of warm milk.  This product is also very sweet.

review/summary: I've eaten these for 15 years
review/text: I have been eating these pepperonis for 15 years.  I have had two go bad in storage but that is not Bridgford's fault.  They store for a year or more at room temperature if you keep them in a cool room but if one gets a puncture in the wrapper or exposed to too much heat, etc., then all bets are off.  If the wrapper is still vacuum tight and the expiration date has not passed, then it should be fine.  If the wrapper is loose at all or the product has expired then, yes, you might have one that is bad.  If it is as bad as some here describe then it is my guess they are eating spoiled food.  Not smart.  But in 15 years of eating these, I have only thrown out two for spoilage and that is after having stored them for quite a while.<br /><br />These do have more fat (and more flavor) than bagged pepperoni.  They do make great pizza but you will have a hard time slicing them as thin and even as some big factory - so just don't expect the exact look, feel, and taste.  These are still delicious in their own right.<br /><br />I have to laugh about reviews from folks who eat seemingly spoiled food and then say that anyone who likes this must work for Bridgford. No, I do not work for Bridgford.  I just eat their products.

review/text: I eat this like a summer sausage with cheese crackers. I'm a fan of meat snacks like beef jerky and summer sausage.<br /><br />I know that this is meant to be used as a pizza topping but all the summer sausages I have tried lately are very moist almost like Spam or potted meat. I like a more dry summer sausauge so I thought I'd try this.<br /><br />This is very dry and solid. This is a plus for me.<br /><br />If you eat it in thick pieces like I do, it has a grainy quality to it. The spices are very strong, distinct, and unique.<br /><br />Where this loses points is the pepperoni casing that surrounds the pepperoni. In most sausages, the casing is so thin that you can't even taste it or know it's there.<br /><br />The casing on this is thick and it tastes similiar to wax paper.<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy this again even to use on pizzas. It will take me a long time to use the two sticks I have left.<br /><br />It's a decent product but just not good to use as a meat snack. It's not worth buying it for pepperoni on a pizza, either, for me. I'll just stick to Hormel for that.

review/text: The person with the negative view must have received pepperoni that had accidentally been punctured at some point. Something is definitely wrong. I have been eating this pepperoni for over 30 years and it is fantastic! Thirty years ago, my brother convinced me to put some slices of the pepperoni in my spaghetti sauce; it was outrageously good. I have used it ever since--me and my entire family.<br /><br />I even eat it "raw" (can't be raw or it wouldn't keep). It's one of my primary snacks on the Atkins (and I've lost 25 lbs). I hope the nay-sayers try it one more time--they are missing out.<br /><br />The super Wal-Marts sell it and they are always running out. And by the way, I live in Sacramento and I'm an instructor at a college; don't work for Bridgeford! I'm only online because Wal-Mart runs out so fast (just came from there) and I would like to buy a large supply I can count on. Actually, I have two, inch and ahalf pieces that I've hid from my husband in the fridge. I guess I'm addicted!

What the hell are you expecting?<br />This isn't a sausage stick to eat like you just bought from a gas station.<br />The fat content is way too high be to eaten plain. Add chunks to a soup, bread, whatever.

review/text: I wasn't sure what these pepperoni slices would taste like, (since Bridgford isn't a brand I'm familiar with) but was pleased with the purchase.  Unlike the other review, there was no foul smell upon opening any of the packages.  The taste, right out of the packaging, was great.  Will definitely be ordering these again.

review/text: I ordered this product and absolutely love it! I will definitely order again and recommend to others. I have been on weight watchers and was really missing my pepperoni when I found this... 12 slices = 2 points :-)<br />I saw a few reviews that said this was not great and I'm here to say that's totally not my opinion. I think that it has even more flavor than regular pepperoni.<br />Has a great spice to it and works great to make a flat bread low point pizza without feeling like your skipping on taste.

review/summary: Different
review/text: I have been preparing pizza at home exclusively for over 20 years and only considered recently to purchase pepperoni in quantity to get a better price. I had tried several brands over the years but this brand has not been offered in my area. After reading other reviews I decided buying 3 pounds was not a big risk.<br />I knew not having a meat slicer was going to be a challenge but I also knew that "practice makes perfect".<br />The flavor is different from what I considered to be the best of pepperoni I had tried, but I have not tried any that may have been considered gourmet quality, and I like it. It is oilier but I don't consider it excessively oily.<br />The bottom line is that if you enjoy preparing pizza from home you should try this Bridgford pepperoni. I have had 2 shipments and both arrived in 3 business days.

review/text: This pepperoni is chewy and a bit oily-- good if you're into that. It's also got a surprise in the form of a strong paprika aftertaste that kicks in about 10 seconds after you've eaten a piece (or two, or however many you're going to munch on at that instance). If you're sensitive to spicy food, this probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Each package yields enough pepperoni slices to populate roughly two 12" pizzas (one if you really want to pile on the toppings).

review/summary: Handy for "Seasoning"
review/text: Off and on over the years I've kept a package of pepperoni in the frig because it's a great "seasoning" product.  You can throw a few into just about any savory dish to add extra flavor.  It works a lot like bacon in that regard, in those instances where you don't need a lot of meat, but a little helps to round out the dish.  You can use these instead of adding flavoring fats too, like butter or olive oil.  It adds variety and broadens your options especially for quick cooking, or when you are out of some of your usual basics and don't feel like running to the store.<br /><br />The problem sometimes is that some brands of pepperoni taste a bit odd - perhaps chemically, or greasy, or papery and bland.  These are good.  I will say that these aren't super-intensely flavored, but to my mind that is good for my purposes.  If you want to get an intensely flavored pepperoni for a particular application or for direct snacking, I figure you want to hit up your local Italian market.<br /><br />I also like the size and thinness of these - they are very thin, which I think is great, because I typically would use these in circumstances where I would want only a few and well distributed in small pieces.  I can use these whole where with some other brands that are cut thicker I'd typically have to cut them up some first.<br /><br />These also taste fresh and have a nice texture.

review/text: Bridford Turkey Pepperoni, it has half the calories as regular pepperoni only 70, regular pepperoni has 140 calories. I found it locally and I have been eating it ever since, I use it when making Pizza and it tastes very good, I like it when it gets crispy in the oven on top of the pizza. I am not an expert in pepperoni, however this low calorie choice does a great job, it doesn't have any after taste or all that grease, maybe because it is made with turkey (less grease, fewer calories) and high quality ingredients. I love low calorie turkey pepperoni! Thank You

review/summary: The slices are, um, greasy
review/text: This review is for the regular sliced pepperoni. The way I use them is to nuke them in the microwave for a couple minutes and it makes a nice spicy pepperoni chip for a low carb diet. Kind of reminds me of thin slices of spicy bacon. Anyway I have done this with lots of different kinds of pepperoni. This pepperoni astonishes me at the quantity of fat that is thrown off during cooking. The grease soaks through several layers of paper towel. People talked about eating them raw and if you did, that would be a lot of fat! No other pepperoni I have tried has generated this quantity of fat during cooking.<br /><br />Now once they have crisped up and you have gotten rid of most of the fat, they are crispy and quite nice. The slices are very thin, so if you go too long they will burn in a flash. I am going to try the thick sliced to see how they work.<br /><br />**UPDATE** tried the thick sliced and they are perfect for my application of pepperoni chips! Way better than the thin sliced. Still amazed by how much orange grease comes off these things during microwaving, but when they are done cooking they are a great consistency and have a nice amount of kick to them. Kind of like spicy bacon. I imagine the thick would be very good on pizza if you don't mind some oil added to your pie.

Walkerswood has something for everybody so move down a scale if you are<br />allergic to hot.<br /><br />Bust out the napkins, grab yourself a beer, and buckle your seat belts cause this stuff is a proper authentic<br />flamefest of Jamaican jerk heat. You can put it on straight, or cut it with a little olive oil, but I've found<br />it best to marinate chicken or pork tenderloins for at least 24 hours before cooking for optimum results. Its a<br />little messy cause you really have to rub this stuff in and make sure you turn/shake your marinade bag every<br />few hour to ensure an even distribution of this wondermous stuff.<br /><br />If you're not using rubber gloves, make sure you wash your hands and I wouldn't plan on rubbing your eyes or<br />doing anything else to sensitive body parts for a while, knowhudahmsayin! haw haw<br /><br />This stuff is the best, followed closely by Grace Jerk Seasoning but Walkerswood doesn't turn your chicken green<br />like the Grace rub does. 5 Scovies

review/text: I was peace Corps volunteer in Jamaica outside of Ocho Rios in the eighties. I was using Walkerswood seasoning in Jamaica and i have used it since coming home. It is the real deal. If you want to add to the experience you can sprinkle the pickling sauce below to your chicken when you serve it.<br />Directions:<br />place cut carrots, onions and the scotch bonnet peppers (whole, and some sliced) fill a glass jar with equal amounts of the mix a layer of each will do.<br />Warm a good white vinegar on the stove (make enough to cover the jarred items) pour slowly the vinegar on top of everything, use a slim knife and push small air bubbles out , cover everything with vinegar. Cover and let set for a few months in a cool dark place the longer it sits the stronger it will be. You can start to use it when the carrots have lost their color, you can top it up when you notice it is low.<br /> How to Use: Sprinkle on your fish or chicken after cooking it. Remember, it's NOT put on when you cook, but after.

review/text: This is the best jerk seasoning - and almost a necessity if you are going to be grilling any type of meat.  It is very spicy straight out of the bottle, but you can mix as little as 1/4 tsp into 1/4 cup of italian dressing, and it will still perk up the flavor of the meat quite a bit.  So don't be scared off just because people say it is hot.  Just add a bit into whatever marinades or seasonings you use now.  I'd give this more than 5 stars if I could.

Now, I prefer to mix it with the Grace mild Jerk to make chicken that's so delicious it put the jerk chicken from my local restaurant to shame. . I've tried mixing the Walkerswood hot and mild together but it's not the same as mixing it with the Grace. Walkerswood is definitely one of the best!

review/summary: By a wide margin, the best of the jerk preparations
review/text: I first brought this home from one of three trips to Jamaica, and it is most emphatically the real deal. Hot to the point of masochism, but throttle back a little on the amount and you catch the tremendous complexity of the flavors; the scallions mellow and deepen the Scotch bonnet pepper assault. As good as it gets; I go through 3-month periods in which it gets added to sandwiches, omelets, egg salad, tuna salad and nearly everything else that's worth preparing. Great marinade for a filet: teaspoon of jerk seasoning, tablespoon each of Worcestershire sauce, Asian sesame oil, red wine vinegar. Give it a day or two and pop on the grill or grill pan. Repeat as needed.

review/text: I should have saved my money, but curiosity got the best of me. I did not have great expectations for this product, but when it arrived, I was surprised to see how small the gumballs were,that when chewed became pretty small in the mouth. The flavor left something to be desired, as it had a smokey chemical taste to them which to me was not enjoyable. Perhaps it would be enjoyed by someone else. By the way I love bacon, but this was not bacon.

review/text: My children love applesauce.  I run an in-home daycare and purchased a case of the cinnamon Earth's Best applesauce cups.  Not one of my kids ate them.  What a waste!  After they all left the cups barely touched, I tasted the applesauce myself and it tasted sour.  The cinnamon was very faint and while every other brand of applesauce I have ever personally tried that is naturally sweetened, this brand did not have a bit of sweetness to it.  (We're talking ripe, tasty apples not High Fructose Corn Syrup sweet here).  I'll keep buying the packs at Trader Joe's - my kids love those and the price isn't that different.  Save your money, go with a different brand....

review/summary: Amazing Multi Purpose Spice Blend!!!
review/text: This is a fantastic all purpose spice blend. Each box comes with a 3.5 ouch pouch of the Tandoori spice mixture which goes a very long way. I did try to make it per the instructions for making the Chicken Masala but found it a bit too much spice all over the meat. However, I have discovered a perfect use for it. We toss it into vegetables that we roast in the oven. I've used it to coat and toast assorted nuts for snacks. It's rich, smokey and wonderfully flavorful. You can make it as heavy or light as you wish. Basic recipe..veggies scrubbed and chopped in 1 inch chunks: 3 large regular potatoes,3 large sweet potatoes, 2 onions, 1# bag baby carrots, 1 large bunch fresh broccoli in pieces. This is my favorite mixture. I then toss all the veggies in a huge bowl with some sea salt, olive oil and about 2-4 Tablespoons of the spice mixture depending on the heat you want. It's not very spicy but a little does go a long way. Once all tossed and coated, on a large oiled baking sheet, I bake at 425 degrees for about 25 minutes, stir with a spatula and continue roasting until done...depending on thickness of veggies, it could take another 25 or more. This is FANTASTIC! You can use these veggies for pita pockets, with tortillas and eggs for breakfast burritos or even alone as a side dish. When our favorite Indian grocery store closed, I panicked and found this online so I could have a backstock. The best thing about getting a case of 12 is that there is enough to share and plenty for backstock. After roasting assorted nuts and seeds for salads, I shared them with a coworker who is also now hooked. For an interesting all purpose seasoning, this is top notch. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MXTJ4S">Badshah Masala, Tandoori Chicken, 3.5-Ounce Box (Pack of 12)</a>

I tried it all and force my self to drink it, since I needed something to keep me warm in this place. Not until I had my friends chai. Oh lord, its so delicious!!! I got my parents hooked and my boyfriend and I only drink this tea at home. I boil water, milk, a lil of ginger and the loose leaf tea altogether, then I drain at the end with a very fine drainer. Absolutely delicious. It makes you feel so good and warm. We LOVE it!!! I like both the Taj Mahal and the Red Label.
