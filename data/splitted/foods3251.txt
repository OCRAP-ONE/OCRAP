review/summary: My kids love these!
review/text: My kids are 8 and 10, and they love to make these as either muffins or pancakes in the mornings. They are simple to make either way - and taste great! The fact that I was able to buy a case on Amazon was the true selling point for me - my kids go thru the mix like water and when I buy alot at the supermarket I have to lug all those groceries up stairs, with the Amazom Prime I get them shipped to my front door for free and cost me the same as I would have paid in the store. My kids also love the Jiffy Blueberry muffin mix and the Chocolate muffin mix as well. I am extremely happy with this purchase, and I plan to order these again in the future if they are available!

review/summary: Good fairly healthy for on the go
review/text: I only got one of these to try so I didn't get to do much experimenting, but here is what I have to say after eating one of them<br /><br />1) yes, the entire thing was completely cooked to a good temperature after 60 seconds.<br /><br />2) this does not have to be refrigerated, making it an excellent choice to keep in a drawer at work or to take with you to school, not sure how well it will sit in a hot car, but seems like a good choice for that meal you wish you had the time or money for but just can't squeeze into the day<br /><br />3) Fairly healthy choice, whole grain pasta that actually tastes pretty good, and a tomato sauce rather than a dairy based which makes it a better choice<br /><br />4) portion size - I added this as a side to a breaded baked Italian chicken dinner.  It added a nice flavor and served the two of us well as the side.  If this were to be my entire meal I imagine this would feed one, as a side dish it feeds two.<br /><br />5) I don't know what the real price is for these, I would consider them to be valued at two to three dollars each.<br /><br />6) As far as the overall flavor, I found the sauce to be a little sweet for my taste, but for the convenience I could put up with the overly sweet sauce.<br /><br />I think that if the price is right, these are an excellent choice for healthy eating at the office, or at school or any other time that you are lacking on time and options.  I would buy these if they were to come available at the local grocer for a reasonable price.

review/summary: Gritty, Sweet and  Missing Something...
review/text: This is my second experience with microwaved whole grain pasta. My first was was the Barilla Whole Grain Fusilli with Veggie Marinara and it was very tasty and enjoyable. This Tomato and Basil Penne Pasta dish not so much. The pasta was gritty, the tomato sauce was sweet with a tad too much basil AND something missing. The sprinkle of Parmesan/Romano cheese I added didn't help. I'm just not a fan of this entree.<br /><br />I still like Barilla's concept of pasta in 60 microwave seconds with the option for adding a teaspoon of water and another 30 seconds for more tender pasta. But even that can't remedy the gritty penne pasta. The 2-stage plastic film venting and removal is STILL a bit tricky. The unique packaging that separates the pourable sauce cup from the pasta to avoid sogginess while cooking can be the source of spillage and additional cleanup. Follow the directions AND steady the container removing both the plastic and the sauce.<br /><br />I'm not likely to purchase this item regardless of the healthy fiber and convenience.

review/summary: Much better than I expected
review/text: Pasta with pre-made sauce isn't very hard to make.  You boil water, drain it, and heat some sauce in the microwave. The idea that somebody needed to prepackage it and make it simpler seemed to be going a bit far to me. But the convenience factor of having a meal in 60 seconds, not needing a refrigerator and being able to heat it up in workplaces made me want to see how much I'd be compromising for convenience.<br /><br />I shouldn't have fretted. After all, Barilla makes Tomato and Basil Sauce and heating it after taking it out of a jar is no different from heating it while it's in its own compartment in a microwavable tray. I used to make my own pasta (whole wheat is harder to work with so I got lazy) and if I can accept dried pasta, then the idea of pasta that's not dried but has the right water content to be microwaved isn't as odd as it seemed.<br /><br />It turned out to be just as advertised. You cook it for 60 seconds, a tray of sauce lifts out, and you pour it on the pasta. It tastes just as good as if you bought dried pasta and a jar of sauce. You don't lose out by getting something microwavable.<br /><br />The company is also fairly honest about the ingredients and it says right on the front of the package that it's made with 51% whole wheat pasta.  That's a lot better than the competition, which likes to say "made with whole grain" even though they refine some of the grain and pretend the two are separate ingredients. All the ingredients seem good and wholesome except for the mysterious "natural flavors" ingredient. It's not necessarily bad for you, but it's not necessarily good for you. I have no way of knowing. This is low in saturated fat, the non-saturated variety comes from olive oil, which is good for you, and the only thing that it's a bit high in is sugar. It contains eight grams. But I'd guess that it would contain about five grams if there were no added sugar, since it occurs naturally in other ingredients.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is as good as store bought pasta that you boil yourself. If you like Barilla's jarred sauce, and you like their dried pasta, then you'll like this just as much and you'll like the convenience.

review/summary: Pasta To Go
review/text: There is no question that when it has came down to microwavable pasta meals, they have been more of a miss than a hit, and sadly lagged upon the taste that was originally was suppose to appeal to the eyes. Barilla has known that when they have made pasta, and their microwaveable pasta meals actually stand out well. Their Whole Grain Mezze Penne with Tomato & Basil stands out well, not just in taste, but also feels like you're really eating pasta on the go, rather than something that was watered down from the other companies like Healthy Choice and their Fresh Meal makers, or other pasta meals that feels waned down. I liked how this tasted at the start, and it was easy to make and a treat to taste. I definitely love this pasta.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: B+<br /><br />Overall: B+

review/summary: Good for what it is
review/text: This is a non-refrigerated, microwaveable meal containing whole-grain pasta and tomato sauce. The packaging states that it is "100% Natural" and contains "No Preservatives." How Barilla is able to give us tomato sauce in liquid form yet without any chemicals to keep it palatable is a mystery to me. The plasticized tray packaging is sealed tightly with a stout film cover, so I guess that's the key.<br /><br />The primary ingredient is whole-grain pasta which is made with whole-grain Durum, Semolina, Durum wheat flour and oat fiber. Speaking of fiber, the one portion will give you 11 grams worth or a whopping 44% of a 2000-calorie diet! For those of us who have reached the stage of life where fiber intake is critical, this is a wonderful bonus. Unfortunately, the pasta is a bit on the chewy side, owing I would guess, to all that fiber. The instructions indicate that you can add a little water before cooking and then cook a little longer to soften the Penne. I had only the one evaluation package, so I was not able to test this option. I have an 1100-watt microwave, and found the 1-minute cooking time adequate.<br /><br />The rest of the ingredient list yields nothing suspicious other than "Natural Flavors," and "Tapioca Starch."<br /><br />The Tomato sauce is packaged in a separate "Sauce Tray" which fits in the main packaging and is microwaved with it. Prior to heating, you peel back the film covering over the sauce to vent the package. When heating is complete, you remove the sauce tray and pour it over the pasta. That works fine. I had no difficulties with any of this.<br /><br />The package will give you 310 calories with 5g of fat and 690mg of sodium. The sodium is high (29%) as it is in virtually all pre-packaged meals. It seems the manufacturers have learned how to control all the nutrients--calories, fat, cholesterol, carbs, everything--except salt.<br /><br />I don't think I'd go out of my way to eat this, but for what it is--an ultra-simple, convenient, quick meal that you could stick in your briefcase or backpack on the way out to work--it was pretty good. If you don't have a cafeteria and don't want something from the deli or the take-out places, this is a good alternative.<br /><br />I just need to say a word about price: I never base my ratings on price, because that can change with time and retailer and sales, but DO NOT pay 45 bucks for 6 of these shipped. That's just plain nuts. At three to four dollars apiece, they make sense based on their convenience. At seven plus, they don't.

review/summary: Convenient, but not great
review/text: I do like the fact that you can just store these in a drawer at work... they need no refrigeration/freezing. So they're very convenient (that's the third star). However, they're not particularly great.<br /><br />First off, the plastic film cover is practically superglued on, so be prepared to clean up a lot of tomato sauce when you finally manage to rip the thing open. The instructions say "ready in just 60 seconds," but you're really talking around 2-3 minutes. I honestly don't know where they get 60 seconds from.<br /><br />The pasta tastes like rubbery plastic, even if you add a little water before microwaving. I do like how the little sauce compartment lifts out of the main dish so you can then pour the sauce separately. Taste-wise, it's... edible. Not horrible, not great. When you don't have the time to go out for lunch or prepare your lunch before work, you'll be happy to have one of these handy containers in your office drawer, but I'm afraid it's not particularly tasty.

review/text: As far as prepared dinner kits go, "Barilla Whole Grain Mezze Penne with Tomato and Basil Sauce" just did not do it for me...and this is coming from a person who ONLY eats freshly-prepared Barilla Whole Grain Pasta at home!<br /><br />The sauce is blandly sweet and completely forgettable, while the pasta itself was more mushy than al dente and had a vaguely gamy taste, too boot.<br /><br />In all, as a long time Barilla fan, I'm quite disappointed with this product.

review/summary: Fantastic for meals on the go!
review/text: I'm a landscape architect and at any given moment, I can end up in one of three neighboring states working on jobs. Eating out is EXPENSIVE and after you've had a month of home-made sandwiches, even the Earl of Sandwich can no longer entice me to chomp down on one.<br /><br />So, I'm constantly on the look-out for meals that I can keep in my truck that require NO REFRIGERATION or Pots/Pans to create the meal. I usually have access to a microwave at a client's home or a gas station, and if you know the staff well enough, they have no problem with your using their microwave to make your meal.<br /><br />I was exceedingly pleased with this product. The whole grain penne made me happy that I was eating well and the sauce had just the right amount of kick without it tasting like a Kid's Meal. Perfect portions; I didn't need anything else to fill me up for lunch. I plan on keeping a box of these meals in my truck for times that I just can't eat one.more.sandwich. or for a quick pick me up when supper is hours away. Plus, I love Barilla pasta and frozen meals so I was delighted to know that these meals come from a company I buy from and trust with quality products.

review/summary: Quick, easy and tastes great
review/text: I was starving after coming back from my workout, so I wanted something quick and healthy for my lunch. This pasta meal did the trick. It cooks up in one minute and was easily prepared by mixing the sauce tray with the pasta. The sauce made this dish. It was very flavorful and not overly salty. The pasta was served al dente. The portion was actually about right for a lunch item. The other thing I like is that it is not a frozen food item, which is great for those that don't have a refrigerator/freezer available at work to store it.<br /><br />The only downside is the high amount of carbs, which can be expected from pasta. The Amazon pricing is competitive with other meals of this sort, at roughly $3 carton. If you use Amazon's subscribe and save, and the $5 e-coupon, it is definitely a bargain and must have for that last minute lunch.

I forgot to put my thumb on the sauce tray last time, but even that was no disaster; I pushed it back down from its tilt, poured the sauce on the pasta and grabbed a fork. I thought I would be much hungrier, but this was enough for a light meal or a substantial snack. I need to see about getting a stack of these for bringing to work.

review/summary: Really Nice and Customizable
review/text: I was actually pretty surprised that this tasted as good as it did. I hate the taste of Chef Boyarde and feared Barilla  would also have that dead can mass factory mystery product taste and oder. It did not. In fact it actually tasted pretty close to what you'd get if you use their dry product and jar pasta sauce.<br /><br />What i really liked was that the sauce was in it's own separate dish. This allows you add as little or as much sauce as you need. The pasta was aldente. Often times<br />these type of products have a very mushy consistence but this did not. Perhaps because the product is not sitting in sauce the whole time prior to cooking.<br /><br />The portion is reasonable as a side dish. However, too small for a stand alone lunch or dinner. This is an excellent product to add your own left over beef or chicken or vegetables.

Still, I was pleasantly surprised - even without adding water, the pasta comes out well cooked - not too soft, not too hard. The only thing I don't like about the pack is that it's tricky to peel back the lid without getting sauce all over. Be careful when pulling back that lid.

review/summary: Good for lunch
review/text: I had a good impression of the product overall. My specific observations:<br /><br />- The meal has some protein, iron and vitamin A with no cholesterol. Like that. You can tell it's going to be a substantial lunch because the package is heavier than any of the frozen food lunch entrees I've purchased. (I like that it doesn't have to be frozen or refrigerated, by the way -- more portable and practical for taking for lunch.)<br /><br />- The packaging is user-friendly and the instructions clear, with illustrations.<br /><br />- A minute for the cooking time was perfect. The sauce tray lifted out easily, and the sauce poured out of it and onto the pasta just great -- not too thick that it had to be spooned or scraped out.<br /><br />- The pasta was very firm, and I could taste the whole wheat flavor. The flavor of the sauce was nice; I enjoyed it.<br /><br />- I love that the ingredients on this are all-natural -- I wish more companies would do that. The packaging separates the sauce from the pasta to help avoid the need for preservatives. A+ on that. It would be great if there were a way to make the bowl cardboard instead of plastic, since microwaving plastic is not healthy, but I won't quibble about that here.

review/summary: Pretty good for microwavable food, but too pricey...
review/text: I really wasn't expecting much from this dish, but was pleasantly surprised. Most one-bowl microwave meals are edible but not much beyond that. This dish, however, was quite tasty and filling as well. Keeping the sauce and pasta separate really does the trick, since the pasta has no chance to get mushy. On the contrary, it was pretty firm and had a nice bite to it. I prefer whole wheat pasta, and the taste, while not as good as if I'd cooked it myself, was more than passable. The tomato/basil sauce was quite good, just spicy enough, with some distinctive and separate flavors. And designing the sauce tray so that it can be picked up and poured over the pasta was a nice touch. All in all, I found this much more palatable than other microwave dishes I've eaten. However, the current price of 6 for $36 ($6 apiece) is far too high for what you're getting, especially when similar dishes sell in supermarkets from $2 to $3 each. So is it good enough to buy? No. Lower the price and I'd consider it.

review/summary: Not Bad
review/text: I have previously tried the Whole Grain style of pasta from a box and thought it was very nasty, but thought that I would give this one a try as I had hoped it had improved over time (not same brand) and was a healty choice.<br /><br />After slightly opening the plastic cover/wrap, to allow venting, you place it in the microwave to cook for 60 seconds.  After removing it, the plastic cover/wrap seems to be stuck a bit firmly to the container, so removal of it should be done carefully or you will spill your sauce.  There is a separate removable mini sauce tray inside of the larger pasta tray that allows you to pour the sauce on your pasta.<br /><br />The sauce tastes just like the normal Barilla sauce (not my normal brand) and the pasta was cooked just about right.<br /><br />If I had not known that this was Whole Grain pasta, then I might not have noticed the slight Whole Grain flavor of the pasta.  It really is not that noticeable and was not bad for what it was.<br /><br />If the price was right, I might have this again in the future.  Would be good for less than 2 bucks, but under three would work too.<br /><br />It is more likely to be used for a work or school lunch, as the portion size was not a "meal" for someone like myself.

review/text: I was so hungry, but feeling uninspired to cook another meal or even make a simple sandwich.  What a great time to try out this easy microwave pasta.  It's so easy, even for microwave food.  No scissors required, just pull back on the cover, microwave, mix the sauce that's been separated with the pasta together and voila, you have a side dish or meal for one.  I sprinkled a little parm on, to make it better.  Still it did seem a little lacking in flavor.  Maybe more salt and pepper would have helped out, or better yet, some frozen meatballs from Costco to throw in.<br /> For the ease and how handy it is, I would give it 5 stars.  For the healthy natural ingredients, I'd give it 5 stars. The flavor brings it down to just 4.  To be fair, the quick microwavable food that tastes better, usually isn't as healthy.<br />All in all, a good choice for a simple, basic pasta dish, that's storable anywhere and healthy to eat.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy whole grain
review/text: This pasta meal tastes almost as good as Barilla's non-whole grain version. The main benefit to this whole grain version is--of course--almost twice as much fiber as the conventional version. It also contains 10 fewer calories and slightly fewer carbs and less sodium, so this whole grain dish delivers comparable taste in a healthier option. The tomato and basil sauce is just as tasty as Barilla's jarred sauces, and the shelf-stable convenience really can't be beat. Be careful as you're removing the film cover--be sure to hold the sauce tray down while you do so, or you'll risk spilling the sauce. I also recommend following the supplemental directions and adding a little extra water after the initial heating period and heating it for an additional 30 seconds in order to soften the noodles.

I love that this meal is only 310 calories and made with healthier whole grain pasta.  I will definitely buy these to keep on hand when I need something fast and flavorful!

review/summary: Just ok
review/text: What's nice about this is that you don't need to keep it in the freezer and it heats up pretty nicely.  The sauce is delicious, but I didn't care for the pasta that much.  I have a love/hate relationship with whole wheat pasta, being it seems to turn to mush if you have any as leftovers, but then I like the extra fiber.  So I thought a single serve might be a good way to get it.  But this pasta had an extreme nutty taste to it, much stronger than in any other whole wheat pasta I have ever eaten.  I didn't care for that and also it had a strange texture, almost rubbery.  The sauce was very good and I liked the how the sauce was packaged separate from the pasta and did a pretty good job of covering up the overly nutty pasta, but in the end I didn't enjoy the pasta so I most likely won't get this again.  I might try the non-whole wheat and see if that has a better texture because for me bad texture is as much a turn off as bad taste.  It's very eatable, but not what I would call good.<br /><br />3 stars.

review/summary: I have to admit to being a little skeptical.
review/text: I was skeptical when I saw the information on this packaging that it cooks in 60 seconds in the microwave.  Then I have to admit to being skeptical that it would come anywhere close to being good.  Guess what folks?  Barilla made a believer out of me on both counts.<br /><br />This is a very ingeniously designed container so you need to read and follow the directions exactly.  Otherwise, I'm envisioning sauce splashed all over the inside of your microwave.  You also need to be careful after it has cooked and you have to pull that film off while holding the sauce container down with your thumb.  Once more, the possibility of sauce everywhere.  But the good news is that if you follow the directions and take it one careful step at a time you will be rewarded with a tasty meal of whole grain penne pasta in tomato basil sauce for 310 calories.  Definitely not a bad thing.  And I like that the sauce and pasta are in separate containers so it is my choice as to how much of the sauce to pour over the pasta.  The label says 100% natural with no preservatives so I worried just a tiny bit about that pasta (which simply MUST have been partially precooked) holding fresh until the best-if-used-by date, which for my box was March 2013.<br /><br />The 60 seconds was just right for having the sauce and pasta thoroughly heated through.  The marinara sauce has chunks of tomato in it so you know it's the real thing.  For my particular taste, the basil was a little too prominent, but at least you could easily see that fresh basil had been used.  I like food where I can recognize ingredients.  The 9 oz tray is a serving for one and was actually a little more than I could finish.  The pasta was definitely al dente so there are directions for how to soften it more if you don't like that much texture remaining after it is cooked.  This whole grain pasta provides 44% of daily dietary fiber, which is great, but also 29% of daily sodium which I thought might be a little high.  Total carbohydrates are 57g or 19% daily recommended.<br /><br />This definitely falls into the "fast and convenient" food category.  It also falls into the "good taste" food category for me.  I use Barilla dry pastas already but I have never tried any of their jarred sauces.  Now I'll be trying some of those too, just maybe not the ones with the basil.  I can positively see the benefit of having several boxes of this pasta meal on my pantry shelf.

review/summary: It has its pros and cons
review/text: Pro: the package directions are correct when they say it only takes one minute to microwave this. If I still worked in an office and I wanted a fast lunch, this would be perfect. Pro: one serving is almost half the daily recommended amount of fiber you need. Con: the texture of the pasta is not great; I could definitely tell it was whole wheat. I like the flavor of whole grain pasta, but not when the texture is slightly gritty. Con: the basil flavor in the sauce is a little overpowering. This isn't my favorite pasta dish ever, but I would consider it again if I needed a really fast, convenient meal that would put a little more fiber and veggies in my diet.

review/summary: Convenient
review/text: This was the first time that I have used Barilla so I was interested to see how it was.  I do have mixed feelings.  I liked the flavor of the sauce, it was pretty good.  However, I did not like the noodles. I am not sure if it was the whole wheat pasta that I didn't like or what, but they were chewy and didn't have the best flavor.<br /><br />  Now I think this is a great product if you are in a hurry for several reasons, and here they are.  It is convenient, you can carry it with you to work or at home and just pop it in the microwave and have a meal. It is quick, it only takes 60 seconds or a little more depending on your microwave and its ready. The portion is good, although perhaps for a hearty eater they may need a little more. However, it certainly fills the need for a quick meal and is good if you are in a pinch for time.

review/summary: It's OK!
review/text: I ran into a couple of problems with this whole grain Mezze Penne with tomato and Basil Sauce.  First, I opened the plastic cover while holding it on it's side...........big mistake.  They do not put another plastic cover over the sauce itself so the sauce totally drained out onto the counter and floor.  I did not see the instructions saying that the package MUST be kept flat on the surface of my counter when I open it.  Because of this, I had to add another can of chopped tomatoes into the penne but it was not a speghetti sauce and did nothing for the flavor.  Next, I did not realize that one MUST microwave this product.  I do not have a microwave but all the products I buy can either be cooked on the stove or in my convection oven.....not this one.  It was a challenge to figure out if the noodles were heated up and cooked enough on my stove top.  And finally, I guess I have never eaten whole grain noodles before because I was taken aback by the hardness and different flavor this product's noodles had.  All in all, I can not recommend this product to people without a microwave.  I am sure I would have found this item tasty and interesting otherwise but I will not be buying it again.

I had been using a tablespoon of the jam in our protein shakes.  My husband went wild over the flavor.  Needles to say we are now addicted to this stuff.  It is wonderful on toast as well.  It has a somewhat tart taste, not too much, just right.  I have been trying to get my local grocer to get it into the store.  So far he has special ordered it for me or as always you can order from Amazon.com, which I have always been very satisfied with.  Try it, you'll love it!

My only issue is that the sugar content is VERY high, and since it's made in Sweden, it doesn't appear we will get a low-sugar version.  Too bad.  I would love to have this in my oatmeal or yogurt every morning but cannot due to the sugar. For anyone not watching their blood sugar, this jam is definitely worth a try, and on so many more things than toast.

review/text: This is the best tasting coffee by far! It's very sweet and there is no bitterness.<br /><br />And there is no coffee maker required for this type of coffee! It's "instant" coffee. Simply put a couple of spoons in a hot cup of water and stir (like tea). The grinds will settle to the bottom. You can also use a tea diffuser.<br /><br />The first time I ever tasted this coffee was when I was visiting overseas. I had never been much of a coffee drinker and usually made my coffee with so much cream and sugar. But with this type of coffee, I can drink it black with only a little sugar (which is how everyone was drinking it).<br /><br />It's absolutely wonderful! Everyone who's tried it is amazed. I am spoiled now.

review/summary: Getting used to Turkish style coffee
review/text: Let me start by saying that, while not a snob or connoisseur, I have tried just about every method of making coffee known to humanity. Drip, perk, pump and steam espresso, Aeropress, Neopolitan, Canadian-made coffee bags, Toddy concentrate and everything but pan boiled with eggshells. I've ground my own beans and even roasted them in small quantities. (I must have been an alchemist in a previous time!) Most of my gear (La Pavoni espresso machine, Capresso pump machine, Capresso conical grinder, countless Bialetti pots, Revereware stainless drippers, etc.,) have come from fortunate thrift store finds.<br /><br />My interest in Turkish style coffee came about with the purchase (online auction-used) of an ASTOUNDING Turkish-made fully electronic, sensor controlled masterpiece of an automatic maker from Beko which is even easy to clean! It has won awards from CeBIT, the world's largest and most international computer expo. Atat&uuml;rk would be proud!<br /><br />I found that my grinder could produce very close to the powder-like nature of ground Turkish coffee. But I wanted to try "the real thing," so I ordered this brand and another. This brand is from Israel and comes as a set of smaller pouches, fulled sealed.<br /><br />My biggest surprise was that the coffee is not as dark roasted as what I had used before. But very pleasant with (traditionally) sugar or without.<br /><br />If you have a local coffee supplier with the gear to REALLY grind down to Turkish style, you are in luck.  If not, give this a try. Standard stove-top boiler pots are cheap, but the Bekos are not.

review/text: I am not sure why this particular order did not have the rich flavor that I have come to associate with "Cafe 1820"... it has been one of the my favorite coffees.  It usually has great rich flavor without the high acid content.  This batch seemed to be missing a lot of the flavor - it may have been on the shelf too long or stored at a high temperature.  I'll order it again, but if it is not up to par - I'll find another source.<br />If you have never tried Cafe 1820, you should... but try to make sure that you are getting a true sample of their normally excellent product.

review/text: I purchased this after comparing the price and the ingredient list to the small 1.25oz packets of Ortega Taco Seasoning sold in the grocery store, and thought it was worth trying. Unfortunately, the flavor is very bland compared to the smaller packets. We tried using more than directed and it didn't make much difference. We have to add chili powder, garlic, onion, sugar and salt to make this seasoning resemble what we are used to. If this much work has to be done you might as well start from scratch. I would not buy this product again.

I sometimes eat one of these in place of lunch or as a snack in the late morning and middle of the day (half in the mid-morning, half after lunch).<br /><br />The bars are relatively low-cal and have a decent amount of protein which, per their packaging, is more easily absorbed than other protein supplements.  I can't speak to their science but the bars seem to be working for me . . . I've lost around 10 lbs over the past month and put on a lot of muscle.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good protein bar, look no further.

review/text: When I am short on time to eat a proper meal, one of these bars and a beverage fits the bill.<br /><br />If I eat one of these and have a large coffee or a glass of iced tea, I won't be hungry for 3 hours.<br /><br />They taste great, have a nice texture and a good balance of protein, carbs and fats.<br /><br />I have tried all the flavors and the triple chocolate crunch is my favorite.<br /><br />They don't spike and crash my blood sugar like some bars do.<br /><br />If you have them in any kind of heat, like stashed in your purse or car, they will melt in the package.<br /><br />I keep these at home in our pantry to grab if the baby is upset and I haven't had a moment to eat anything.<br /><br />The price here on Amazon is the cheapest you will find ANYwhere.

review/text: Like all the other reviewers, I have tried many protein bars.  These are by FAR the very best I have ever eaten!  Great for post workout, or a grab and go in the morning or for snack.  They taste like those sugar wafer cookies I ate when I was little... Of course, these don't have near the sugar - so I guess it's more like the sugar wafer cookies with a "less sweet" but still delicious filling! :)  Peanut butter crunch and cookies and cream are both d'lish!

I like it because of the different texture than a lot of bars. Most I have tried have been sort of gummy and chewy, but this has the nice cripness of the cookie wafer. The bar tastes really good and I will buy this one again

review/summary: Great ingredients, great bar
review/text: These Creme Filled Wafer bars taste absolutely amazing!!!  They do not have any of the chalky taste of most high protein bars and it is very light and crispy, compared to any other bar on the market. I have a very busy lifestyle with work, the gym, surfing, mountain biking, etc, so bars and protein drinks are a staple.  I have tried many bars and this one is my favorite.  I used to love zone bars because they were crispy and not as "Dense" as most protein bars, but then I discovered these bars and I will never go back.  These bars are the perfect snack when you need protein fast. I take no xplode before I workout so I can't eat anything 2 hours prior to my workout. My workout are usually 1 to 2 hours long and not eating for 4 hours can really put a strain on your goals of bulking up.  I take a power crunch bar with me to the gym and eat it during my workout. Its light enough where it doesn't reduce the pump I get from the no xplode and it's just enough to get the protein you need to build muscle.

review/summary: Great for trekking while on holiday
review/text: I was lucky enough to meet the creator of Power Crunch while on holiday in the Sacred Valley in Peru. We had 2 weeks of day to day trekking in the Andes and our in-take of daily Power Crunch bars really saved the day. The terrain, the altitude and the food were challenging while being of our normal whole-food diet. I felt like Power Crunch really helped my body adjust and get a little extra out of an eXtreme vacation and tour schedule. I'm so excited by the taste and texture I'm ready to find a distributor in Asia so that Power Crunch can be part of my active daily lifestyle. You only need to try one to be hooked; do it when you need a little extra boost and you'll be back for more.

review/summary: Tasty and light
review/text: If those dense, heavy nutrition bars are too rich for you to tolerate or if you can't handle them after a hard workout, this one is worth trying.  It's very tasty and light.  The wafers give it a nice texture and crunch and it will remind you of those creme wafer cookies from childhood but much tastier and with better nutrition.  I will say that if you're looking for a "super bar" this may not be ideal because it does have a little more fat in it than other bars I like and a bit less protein and carbs, but it's worth buying because it tastes really good, it's light and easy to digest.  For me, this is a great meal replacement bar/snack or great after a light to moderate workout.

review/text: They don't fill you up.<br /><br />My plan was, for lunch, to slowly eat one of these with a large glass of water. It's what my friend does with his nutrition bars.<br /><br />However, not only are these incredibly light, small, and I mean small, we're talking 3-4 bites, maybe 5-6 half-bites. Even if you chew 1-2 minutes(nearly impossible)<br /><br />They have a kind of sandy texture. Like you've just eaten caramel dipped in sand.<br /><br />The taste is alright, but I am disappointed. Triple Chocolate and I could not taste the chocolate. It barely tasted like anything...just had a kind of bland taste to it.<br /><br />At this price...I am disappointed massively. These were top rated by so many...<br /><br />But I think I will try the bar my friend has - his are 32g's of protein, 2.5x this ones, and only 30-40 more calories. Those are filling from what I've seen, have way more to them as well. Bigger, about 30% bigger size as well. To top it off? They are the same price and often on sale...they also have Vitamins and anti-oxidants.<br /><br />These, I don't know. If you down them with a Glass of Carnation instant breakfast, it goes well, kinda a good combo, not to heavy, just right. But this + water...not filling in the least.<br /><br />These are treats for after a meal, I suppose. I was looking for meal replacers. Ect, replace a breakfast here, or a lunch there. So I don't lose any muscle, just fat.<br /><br />I would recommend them if you want something very light to have as an after-snack to a small meal<br /><br />But these are not meal replacers. These do not go by themselves, you eat these + a meal. Just make sure you know that.<br /><br />It's my fault, I suppose for not researching.

review/summary: Not The Best Option Out There...
review/text: I had high hopes for these bars... I am a huge chocolate wafer fan! I am familiar with protein/energy bars and knew going into it that there would more than likely be a hint of that chalky protein bar flavor... but it hit me like a brick wall with the first bite. Luckily my husband has tastebuds that are muted to flavor, so he has slowly been able to work through this box of protein bars so we weren't just throwing money away... but wow. Just overall very disappointing. I went by reviews before deciding to purchase these, and most reviews were awesome...  so I can only assume that these are just one of those bars that is hit and miss. Some are going to love it, others are going to hate it. Unfortunately, I am in the latter group for this one. (And as a side-note, I shouldn't even call this a protein bar since it only contains 13g protein --- my all time favorite protein bar contains 20g. Granted, 13g is still a lot... but if you can choke this down, surely you can choke down a 20g bar with more flavor. In the future I will stick with my tried and true Chocolate Mint Builder's bars.)

review/summary: Mouth watering!
review/text: Over the last 3 years I have sampled every major protein bar offering and I have to say these Power Crunch bars are my favorite.  It has a very sugary, chocolate taste that is similar to real chocolate wafer cookies. Power Crunch does not have the thick, hard protein "paste" you'll find in most bars. The chocolate wafer style is soft and almost disintegrates in your mouth - quite a contrast from most protein bar offerings. I've eaten probably a dozen a week for the last six weeks and I still cannot get enough of these bars.<br /><br />In all fairness most protein bars have 30+ grams of protein - more than double the amount than the 14 grams in Power Crunch. So personally I consider Power Crunch to be a very healthy high protein candy bar rather than protein bar. But after tasting Power Crunch, it'll be a long time before I reach for another Detour, MET-Rx, Oh Yeah, South Beach, or any other bar.

review/summary: A *true* protein bar, does NOT contain hydrogenated oils!
review/text: My wife and I love these Power Crunch bars!  They have a great protein content and are low carb, which is great for our current exercise and diet routine.  Contrary to what's listed above, it does *not* contain hydrogenated *anything.*<br /><br />However, we're a bit concerned with the Palm Oil and Palm Kernel oils, and were told by BNRG that this was the healthiest alternative for the chocolately coating on the outside and the inside filling that would remain solid at room temps.<br /><br />My suggestion to them would be to make an alternative variety that has NO chocolatey coating (much like Bisco's sugar wafers), thus limiting the amount of oils that they'd need to use in these otherwise stellar protein bars.

review/summary: Cookies & Cream taste weird
review/text: I have had the vanilla, triple chocolate and PB versions of the power crunch bars and those are all very good.  The cookies & cream flavor however tastes very strongly of fake sugar.  For some reason the other flavors do a better job at masking this, the C&C  does not.<br /><br />I recommend having these with a hot drink, if you drink something cold while eating them you get a weird filmy coating to the roof of your mouth.  All flavors work well at keeping hunger away for 3 hours and do not cause gastric distress like some low carb bars can.  I prefer the other flavors over the C&C, but these are fine if the other flavors are gone and I need a quick bite with my morning coffee.<br /><br />I do not crave sweets after I eat a power crunch bar; sometimes sugar substitutes make me want to eat more sugar, but these actually cut my sweet tooth off at the pass.

review/summary: Taste like a chocolate covered wafer. With STEVIA!!!
review/text: I was looking for a bar to snack on that wasn't loaded with carbs and sugar. This was it. It only has 4g of sugar in the whole bar and the rest is STEVIA. I couldn't tell at first and i wondered why it still tasted sweet so when i read the label I found the stevia. LOW LOW LOW on carbs too. I hate the gummy yucky..chewy texture of most health bars or power bars. this was a nice change and crisp. I only eat the Triple chocolate and the chocolate peanut butter. Those are the only two flavors that use STEVIA. the other flavors use sucralose and tasted waaaayyyyy too sweet.<br /><br />I bought them online here becuz at the store they were usually 3/$5. SO this was a bargain.<br /><br />Love them, Thanks. Taste even better cold out of the fridge.

review/summary: I am addicted to these
review/text: I have been controlling my weight for the last 6 months (lost 22 lbs) falling off of the horse eating cake and stuff but when I discovered these 2 weeks ago, my "sugar jones" was redirected from high glycemic snacks to these.  If you have to sin, these have 13g of protein, 5g of sugar so they won't put you in a diabetic coma. I recommend Peanut butter cream.

review/summary: Hydrolyzed protein is the best absorbed
review/text: These bars contain hydrolyzed whey protein, which is the highest quality. It doesnt matter if a bar contains 100g of protein if you dont absorb any of it. Hydrolyzation "pre digests" the protein so it absorbs more completely and quickly. These bars are the only ones that contain only hydrolyzed protein that I've found. Hydrolyzed protein also gives less gas. They taste great as well. They are very light and melt in your mouth a bit.

review/summary: Delicious & Nutritious!!
review/text: Power Crunch bars are perfect for me. Unlike most protein/health bars, these are very easy on the teeth, very soft, yet crunchy from the wafer cookie part. They easily melt in your mouth. The taste is great on every single flavor! The vanilla was good but boring. Peanut butter fudge and cookies and cream are VERY good!<br />I've been using protein bars to lose weight. I've lost 100 lbs now and will continue to live on these wonderfully healthy bars from Power Crunch. Yum! And the numbers on the label are great, too!

review/text: Has a higher fat content then I like but power bars should be eaten more early in the day anyways, so the fat will convert to energy (unless you overeat)<br /><br />a very light and yummy power bar considering it tastes just like a chocolate covered wafer.<br /><br />a new favorite power bar

review/text: I hate all traditional Protein Bars. I understand that this is not a protein bar but I consumed more protein than I would have otherwise. Definitely enjoyable to eat and makes for a great snack when I get home from work and head to the gym before dinner.

review/summary: tasty but high fat content
review/text: Compared to other protein bars, this one tastes the best. It is not chalky. It is easy to eat. Not too sweet like some "energy" bars. However, almost half of the calories is from fat and the protein content is lesser than other protein bars. Maybe as a snack. Definitely not a protein supplement.

review/summary: This is a diet food???  WOW!
review/text: This is one amazingly crunchy chocolate treat--It's got more fat than "low fat" products (9 grams), but it is relatively low carb and definitely high protein. It is actually good for you and yet... you'll think you're cheating when you treat yourself to one of these bars.

review/summary: Easy and delicious
review/text: I have bought these bars for years, but when I was no longer able to find them locally - I tried on Amazon!  Of course, ANYTHING you are looking for, you can find on Amazon!  I eat one of these bars with a cup of coffee in the morning as I like something to eat when I first get up.  Also great to have before going to workout.  They taste great!  I like the vanilla the best - but the peanut butter is pretty good too.  They are lower in calories and high in protein and taste great!  Happy with the bar!

review/text: These protein bars are absolutely amazing.  I could eat these all day they are so tasty.  The best thing about them is that they have a WHEY protein blend and not a SOY protein blend, which makes them a more complete protein. Would I rather be eating chicken breasts...?  Yes, but when I am on the go, these are amazing!

review/text: I eat a lot of protein bars and these are really very tasty. Just be careful when ordering in summer - because my box MELTED when delivered a day earlier than expected. Yep, sat out in the sun in 105 degree heat all day... nice. Expensive lesson learned.

review/text: These don't taste like good for you food, but they are. My 2 year old loves them. I wanted to clarify something written in one of the other reviews -  that these bars DO NOT contain hydrogenated oil. They contained hydrolyzed whey protein (I had to check it out for myself, as I certainly want to avoid bad oils). Here is the link to the nutritional information [...]
