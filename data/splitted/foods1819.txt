review/summary: Really does work
review/text: This product is one of the few on the market that does what it says it does.  In a household with 3 cats and 1 dog (and a light beige carpet) there are sometimes monthly occurrences of things that cause panic.  In 6 years I've had my carpet professionally cleaned once.  Everything else has been taken care of with this product.  Friends came over for dinner last night and commented on the how nice the carpet looked. Great value for the price and really delivers.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor.  Get the Bissell Little Green Machine with it and your carpet will look amazing.

review/summary: Stong smell, but amazingly effective!
review/text: We have pets that sometimes get frightened when left alone.  This stuff not only gets the smell out, but it gets the discoloration out too.  It works on vomit, food, pee, poop, everything!  We use it on almost any stain - whether it was from a pet, child, or whatever.  We love the stuff.  We have tried many different brands and product types.  This is by far the best. The smell is strong, but we are so happy with its effectiveness that it is a small, and very temporary, price to pay.

review/summary: The best I found
review/text: There are a number of similar products on the market, and I've had varied results with them. In pet stores, the ubiquitous choice is Nature's Miracle Stain & Odor Remover for Pets. It's guaranteed to work or your money back. My multiple experiences with it made me wish I took them up on their offer. The company makes an effective laundry booster, but their stain and odor eliminator never quite did the job. Plus, odors came back over the following days.<br /><br />A better product I found was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFI3AE">OUT! Pet Stain and Odor Remover, 32 Ounce</a>. I'm mentioning it primarily to give an idea of how it compares to the others. It does a credible job, and I found it much more effective than Nature's Miracle. It did not get rid of odors completely, but with multiple applications, it did a workable job. Odors did come back over the following days, requiring additional applications.<br /><br />The Lambert Kay works best among these brands. It does a very good job up front. While it might not eliminate every odor on the first application, it's the most likely choice to do so. Unlike the others, over the next few days the odor control will actually improve. Faint remnants of odors after an initial application might not be there two days later, while the opposite is true with competing products.<br /><br />I consider this product the hands down winner. But the Out! brand works well enough that it might be the best product at your local pet store. I've had a harder time finding the Lambert Kay locally (which could be an issue since pets don't give advance notice) but it's easy to find on Amazon.

review/text: We have 3 cats who stay indoors. They all get hairballs. When they come up, so does anything else in their gastric tracts - food, stomach acid, etc. For some reason they will always leave any durable surface and head straight for any piece of carpeting they can find to hurl! By following the directions carefully,this has become a product that takes the panic out of the process for me. It's the best I have found. I get it in the larger size.

review/summary: Child Friendly Gluten Free Bread!!!!!!!
review/text: We stopped into this cute bakery on a recent trip to San Antonio where it is located.  We bought a loaf of their gluten free white bread for our 8 year old recently diagnosed with Celiacs Disease.  He loves this bread!  When I made him a grilled cheese he said it "tastes just like a real grilled cheese!"  It has a great taste and NO BITTER AFTERTASTE as is commonly the case with other gluten free breads we've tried.  Unfortunately, it is much more expensive(about $2.50 more when buying a single loaf)than the Udi's Gluten Free White Bread we usually buy at our local grocer BUT, in its defense, the loaf is much bigger than an Udi's Gluten Free White Bread loaf (my son calls Udi's toy food sized bread).  A slice of this Little Aussie Bakery White Bread is the closest in size to a regular slice of bread that we have found since he got sick.  I wish we lived in San Antonio because I would love to be able to buy him this bread exclusively but with the expensive price per loaf and expensive shipping ($9.99 for 1 loaf) we just can't afford it:(

I then pour the soup over a cup or two of fresh, chopped spinach (the heat from the broth will wilt the spinach).  Squeeze a little lime juice onto the mixture, and garnish with cilantro.  Yum.

review/summary: Not 'instant' to make and does require more additional ingredients
review/text: I love trying new food and being a recent gluten sensitive, I now had to find a substitute for my love of 'instant' noodles.  So upon the reviews I was sold.  However, this is not 'easy to make' as it does require you to have additional ingredients in the house: shitake mushrooms, meat (optional), for example.  Also, what I was not expecting was the 'strong' cinnamon component in the soup base: I know cinnamon is good for you, but fragrant wise, it was strong to both my nose and taste buds.  I am not sure where the mushroom flavor was going to come from other than when I add additional ingredients like the mushrooms?<br /><br />The rice noodle cooks really quickly and does become 'gooey', so do watch out for that if you do add other ingredients to the pot.

You definitely need other things to go<br />with it, like veggies, tofu or meat, etc.  And LOTS of other seasoning and spices, since the packet that comes with it is bland, bland, bland!<br />Too much cinnamon for my taste and even when mixed with veggie broth, needed loads of salt.  (And I am not a salt person).<br />Very disappointed.  I am now stuck with 5 boxes that have been sitting in my pantry forever.

review/summary: CRAZY good pasta (whole wheat or not!)- angel hair
review/text: I converted to whole grain foods early on- I'm a distance swimmer and a long time vegetarian, so overall pretty healthy, but my cholesterol was rising (genetic), so the last frontier was going whole grain. And it totally worked, it's just that the pasta that was available was HORRIBLE. The worst whole wheat pasta on the market was the spaghettis, for some reason- it was like the thinner the pasta got, the worst it tasted. Every whole grain spahetti we tried was bitter or gluey or rubbery.<br /><br />A few years ago, after trying pretty much every brand on the market, we stumbled upon binaturae. We went through all their larger pasta shapes, and finally, after months of craving a big bowl of angel hair, I ordered the Spaghettini.<br /><br />The Spaghettini is sort of like angel hair- a thinner version of spaghetti.<br /><br />And the taste? WOW so good. I mean, REALLY GOOD. In fact, I like it better than *regular* semolina pasta, which is saying a lot since I'm Italian and grew up in a house where pasta was on the menu every other day. And I'm not talking the crummy box kind, either.<br /><br />The bionaturae pasta is not only tasty, but it's durable. What I mean by that is unlike most whole grain pastas, you don't have to babysit it while it cooks- if it cooks a minute too long it won't disintegrate or dissolve, and if its cooked a little too al dente, it still tastes good and is tender. There's no weird grainy, mealy thing happening. It's very hard to find a whole wheat pasta of ANY shape that not only tastes good no matter how long it's cooked, but holds up to super thick sauces and veggies and things like that. It even holds up to days of leftover reheats.<br /><br />Love this pasta. So happy I found it- my cravings for giant bowls of angel hair pasta with some fresh tomatoes and a generous sprinkling of parmesan are now satisfied on a regular basis.

review/summary: The best whole wheat pasta bar none
review/text: I first tried this brand after Cook's Illustrated rated it as the best whole wheat spaghetti.  As usual, they were right.  Not only that, but their cooking method is one I've adopted as well with great success.  Turns out you don't have to keep the heat on your pasta after you add it to boiling, salted water.  Just stir it in, put a lid on it, turn off the heat and set the timer for whatever the package says.  This method has yet to fail me.  I no longer have to stand there stirring the pasta till it comes back to a boil and then guessing at how long it took for the water to come back to a boil.  There are no more boil-overs and of course it saves energy.  But best of all, the pasta is done perfectly.  I have tried this method with all types and shapes of pasta and it always works.  But even if you are reluctant to try this method, definitely try this pasta.  It's fantastic.

review/summary: Best Spaghetti
review/text: Many whole grain pastas are difficult to cook, and come out heavy and/or sticky. Not this product. Easy to cook.  Wonderful flavor and texture. Extraordinary. It is to white-flour pasta as whole wheat bread is to white bread: More flavor, texture, and health benefits.<br /><br />I deviate from the cooking instructions slightly by bringing the water to a boil, lowering the heat, then adding the pasta* (and never return it to a boil). I usually cook for about 14 minutes, which is four minutes longer than the instructions, but at a lower heat.  I add sliced mushrooms to the water while it is cooking. After draining the water off, i add freshly crushed garlic, 2-3 tablespoons of heart-healthy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FLCOUQ">Nutiva hemp oil</a>, and basil leaf puree (when available) or rehydrated dried basil leaves (when fresh basil is out of season). Add a glass of red wine, some vegetables & sardines, a dab of raw sauerkraut on the served pasta, and this is the perfect meal.  And it's heart-healthy too.  I don't add any salt to the water while it's cooking, but do salt the pasta to taste when served.  Occasionally (rarely) i'll use a little tomato based spaghetti or antipasto sauce, but this pasta really doesn't need it.  Most pasta sauces contain sugar, and more salt than if you just use a salt shaker and salt your pasta to taste.  (Most people don't realize that sugars containing fructose are metabolized directly into fat by the liver, and can be bad for the heart.)  Hemp oil has nearly a perfect ratio of Omega-6 to 3.<br /><br />I've been buying this pasta by the case for years now, at local grocery stores, when it goes on sale.  Just noticed that Amazon carries it.  Amazon's price is as good as most of the sale prices, so will probably start ordering it on-line and save myself the trouble of looking for sales and special ordering it from my local store.  I just bought four cases last week.<br /><br />_________________________<br />* I add about 1/10 of the package of pasta at a time, letting the hot water soften it so it'll bend in my pot.  I add each subsequent bunch of pasta in the same manner, but staggered from the other bunches.  Maybe this isn't necessary for this product, but it is a habit -- developed from cooking other whole wheat pastas over the years -- to ensure adequate hydration of all the pasta & prevent clumping.  I then stir the pasta about three or four minutes later, once it has softened up, to ensure none of the bunches have clumped (have never found this pasta to do so, but again habit).  I add the mushrooms about half-way through cooking, and stir once more.

review/text: This chocolate is creamy and wonderful. I practically lived on this Milka chocolate when I visited Germany. It's a popular brand there. Once you taste it, you can see why. I can't say enough about it. I'll be ordering some when it comes back into stock. All chocolate lovers should get to try Milka. Love this stuff!!

review/text: I havent actually purchased these here yet, but I grew up with the Milk Brand in Europe, and I am SOO pleased to see them here for sale. All I can say is if your a chocolate lover, you WILL LOVE MILKA, its in no way close to any of the chocolate I've had here of just regular store brand typs. So if you need a small push, here it is, you wont regret it, I dont know anyone how doesnt absolutely love it when they taste it.

review/text: I've tried them all, literally.  I came across this drink completely by accident while I was at Whole Foods.  Looked at all of the healthy, organic ingredients and told myself this looks awesome but it must taste like chalk.  Too impressed with ingredient and nutritional profile, I bought one anyway.  Chilled it , drank it the next morning after my morning workout and I was AMAZED!!  Taste, consistency, and most importantly the way I felt after was incredible.<br /><br />They use complex carbs from brown rice for a slower releasing , long lasting energy source that I actually felt (no crash from sugary drinks).  They use organic whey!!, yes organic whey! protein which is almost impossible to find anywhere and the best available kind.  All the antioxidants and vitamins are a huge plus especially if you work out as much I do.  I'm a triathlete and orthopedic surgeon so I like to review everything extremely carefully before consuming.  This drink is an 11/10 in every category!  Keep up the good work guys and I'm looking forward to another flavor because I drink 2-3 a day.

review/summary: the orgain gets 10 stars
review/text: so... i have a dietitian now who's helping me lose another 40 pounds. i lost 30 myself this past year and needed help revamping my program and staying on track.<br /><br />so she put me on whole meal replacement (WMR) diet-- with a 1200 calorie daily and only whole foods. every afternoon for the last 2 months i've stopped my day for an Orgain shake.  255 calories total. I CHOse Orgain because i liked the ingredients. i wasnt interested in losing weight by eating chemistry-based non-foods. (my other WMR is an every-morning Macrobar- coconut.) those 2 WMRs plus 2 snacks and 1 meal in the middle of the day has been working great.)<br /><br />both the vanilla bean and the chocolate Orgain shakes are delicious, filling and satisfying.  they really are best **cold**.<br /><br />the nutritional stats are good-- my dietitian was happy i discovered them and has added them to her list of recommended WMR shakes. i'm happy to report i've lost 6 pounds *each* month these past 2 months!

review/summary: Better than Boost or Ensure
review/text: I tend to be a very picky eater. When my appetite is too low to get enough food/fuel in me, I have been inclined to ignore the ingredients in Boost and Ensure and drink them to help me keep "meat" on my bones. How delighted I was to see Orgain on my grocery shelf! It looked similar to the other brands, but I can read the label without as much cringing! I like the organic ingredients. I use this for rehydrating after a workout outside or at the gym. The consistency is thinner than Boost or Ensure, but the flavor is similarly pleasant. It would get 5 stars if it was creamier. I drink it frosty with ice crystals in it and enjoy it as much as when it is room temperature. The flavor is smooth without the weird protein or chocolate/vanilla/sweetener flavors of other supplements.

I just have to let others know that this protein shake is incredible in every way; the taste, organic certification!!, and nutritional profile is hands down the best ready-to-drink I've ever come across.  My wife and I were shocked at that there is organic whey protein (VERY hard to find!) and that wonderful fruit and veggie blend.  I'm a personal trainer so I recommend this to all my clients now as an ideal replenisher.  I feel a considerable difference in my energy and health.  I'll be using Subscribe and Save from now on for this!  I highly, highly recommend this drink if your looking to an alternative to all the junk out there.

review/summary: I've tried them all...This one's a winner
review/text: I've had muscle milk, myoplex, unjury (which was tolerable), anything whole foods, central market, or the vitamin shoppe had to offer...GAG.  Then I tried Orgain.  YUM.  I am no having one of these and one Blueberry or Mango Mix 1 Protein shake per day and actually meeting my protein requirements each day.  My nails and hair are finally looking better and I'm actually starting to have more energy.  I'm so glad Amazon carries these, as my Whole Foods tends to run out of these.  I do however wish that they would put them on automatic subscription, as they have with the Mix 1 shakes.<br /><br />It's great that it's still whey protein, I've definitely never found a whey shake that tastes this good, only the soy ones, which don't have the best absorption.<br /><br />Also, it's great that you can travel with these shakes and not have to refrigerate them or mix them, as they are ready to drink.  I'll just get a cup of ice while traveling or at the office and I'm good to go!  You can even add supplement powder to it if needed, and it dissolves well in it. I actually recommend this flavor over the fudge one, and I'm a chocolate nut.  The fudge just was a little too cocoa-ey for my taste.  The vanilla is pretty sweet, which I like.  I think it might be yummy with some Starbucks Via added in it for an iced latte too.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/20/2011<br />I saw where another review stated that they had received curdled milk!  I did too.  Amazon sent 2 new cases immediately, but unfortunately both of them were curdled as well.  I had ordered the mocha from another online retailer at the same time and it arrived without incident.  I'm not sure why 4 cases arrived curdled, but it was pretty gross when I got lumpy milk instead of my usually amazing Orgain breakfast.  I wanted to do the subscribe and save, but cancelled it, until someone makes sure they know why it was curdled and can ensure it won't arrive in that condition.

review/text: My son is a competitive high school swimmer that practices more than 20 hours per week.  He's a very picky eater so I know he doesn't get enough protein or calcium from regular food.  After a lot of research I bought one of each flavor and he loved them all, especially the mocha.  So now he has one every day after practice and said he can tell the difference in the way his muscles feel after a work out or how tired he is.  I would recommend this to any athlete or parent of an athlete, as a great way to get the nutrition needed.

review/summary: Orgain is still great- just beware of bad batches
review/text: Yes, Orgain changed their formula recently. Among other things, it no longer contains soy, which I think is a good thing since it can be an allergen and can cause digestive discomfort (gas, bloating, in some cases).<br /><br />Unfortunately, with this change, apparently some bad batches made it out into the market (mine were dated 8/21 and 8/22). These batches have a weird and very strong "grassy" flavor that is indeed quite disgusting (which I think I've tasted before from some organic milk from grass fed cows).<br /><br />However, if you receive these batches, please try contacting them with your concerns before jumping to conclusions. I sent them a private message on Facebook ([...]) with the codes on top of my drinks, and they quickly responded, sending me free replacement cases.<br /><br />The replacements tasted just like the formula before the change (as far as I could tell).<br /><br />They know there's a problem, and are working to resolve it. Customer service still exists in the Internet age of automation!

review/summary: Tastes like mothballs
review/text: Oh, dear God it tastes like mothballs. I really wanted to like this product and commit to it -- so I ordered a case of the creamy chocolate fudge shakes. I previously was on the Robard products, but didn't like having to go to the doctor every week so I could get the shakes (it's doctor-supervised). Robard shakes are delicious and filling, but have a lot of unhealthy ingredients and are expensive, plus not readily accessible. When I found Orgain, I thought it'd be a great alternative because it's organic. However, if you're lactose-intolerant, beware -- it contains milk. And a very strange mediciney taste. I'm stuck with a case of this stuff -- maybe if I blend it with bananas it'll be palatable. Buy a couple of the single servings, if you can find them, before committing to a large order.

I drink one everyday, either before heading out in the morning to the aerobics class or as a healthy snack in the evening. I have been drinking the Orgain Mocha for years, purchasing them at local stores. July 2012 I ordered a 12 pack from Amazon.

review/text: I was ecstatic to finally find a protein drink that was healthy. A drink that was organic, had additional nutrient value, had plenty of protein, and that tasted good! A drink that did not have artificial flavors, sweeteners, preservatives, gluten or any other added chemicals. Orgain has been very beneficial for my husband who is undergoing chemo. It was expensive for us given our medical bills but it was one of the only things he could keep down. I signed up to have 2 cases delivered a month by Amazon, thereby getting a discount for doing so. I received my shipment for two months. I then received an email from Amazon saying Orgain was not available anymore through Amazon. I subsequently received another email that stated it was available again. Great! But then I noticed no monthly discount and the price had jumped up considerably. What a huge disappointment. Orgain 5 stars...Amazon no stars.

review/text: Discovered Orgain when I was pregnant and making a long drive from Virginia to Florida. Orgain is delicious! It doesn't need to be refrigerated so it's great to keep in your bag for if you get hungry. I'm very conscious about what I eat and when I leave home for long periods I almost ALWAYS have Orgain with me. I'm crazy about Orgain!! :)

review/summary: Orgain
review/text: I just had a heart bypass and my doctor recommended a diet high in protein to help build muscle mass after the surgery.  I had never tried a supplement other than a multi-vitamin.  I try to eat organic so I was told by a nurse that there was an organic protein drink on the market.  I did some research and found that ORGAIN met my requirements.  I've been drinking it for about two months now, at least one a day.  Not only do they taste good, but they have helped me gain back a lot of the muscle mass that I lost during my hospital stay (almost two weeks).  The only draw back to the product is the cost.  Most protein supplements cost a little more than half the cost of ORGAIN, but being organic I guess justified the higher cost.  I would highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Problem Solved With Orgain
review/text: Since I serve lunch, there's no time or space for a sandwich. I've been looking for something I can drink for lunch, but everything I encountered included unsavory ingredients and/or had a terrible taste. Orgain is one of the more expensive protein drinks but it's worth it. I don't get tired of the creamy vanilla bean flavor and the chocolate tastes like a frothy glass of chocolate milk. It fills me up without making me sluggish and is also a great boost when you need some fuel for working out.

review/text: Orgain Creamy Chocolate Fudge is my favorite, but there is also a Mocha flavor that is also really good.  The Mocha is not as thick as the Creamy Chocolate Fudge. I don't like the vanilla.  The ingredients don't contain anything with chemical names like a lot of pre-packaged foods, and I like that it was created by a doctor who had cancer and wanted to create a healthy food.

review/text: My wife and I go through 1-2 cases of these a week. They are a wonderful meal replacement, and also make good high protein snacks in a hurry. I drink one for breakfast on my way out the door almost every work day. It comes in very handy that you don't have to refrigerate them until you want to drink, as you can keep a case in your office at work. They're organic and surprisingly tasty. I like all 3 flavors, although the iced mocha is my favorite. My wife prefers the chocolate.<br /><br />I've tried several of the competing products, and these are my favorite taste-wise. They are also high in protein and low in sugars.

review/summary: Orgain Creamy Chocolate Fudge
review/text: I tried the Orgain Creamy Chocolate Fudge and was very happy with the taste.  I use these as a meal on the go and they have been great.  I always keep them refrigerated and pop one in the freezer before I drink it so it can be slightly slushy( if you leave it for too long you might end up needing to squeeze it out of the box though)...I also sometimes blend the shake with a banana, so tasty! It is a little pricey but I have yet to find something less expensive with the same quality and taste. Overall, I was happy enough with them to buy again. I might try the vanilla (because of other positive reviews) but for sure I will order some more chocolate.

review/text: I have been looking for a great tasting, ready-to-drink protein supplement that does not contain any artificial sweeteners. Artificial sweeteners give me a headache, I do not like the way they taste and they are horrible for you. This product tastes great, has 16 grams of whey protein and many additional vitamins, minerals and antioxidants from organic sources. I usually make a whey protein smoothy post work-out with unflavored whey (without all the added chemicals), but Orgain is great if you do not have time or are just looking for a meal replacement. The only con is that it is a little on the pricey side and is hard to find in stores, but if you look at all the ingredients, I think it is worth it.

Most other products are too sweet or artificially sweet.  This is just great.  I'd drink two or three a day if I could afford it.  I love the chocolate more than the vanilla, but it's good too.  I haven't tried the mocha.  I'm a coffee lover so will try it soon.<br /><br />Tried the mocha and I like it too.  Like the chocolate better though.  Just found these at Whole Foods on sale this week thru 23 June, for $2 each.  If you buy a case of 24 you save another 10%.  I just bought 2 cases.

review/summary: Best tasting, most nutritious RTD out there
review/text: In order for me to get the nutrition I need, I have to supplement with protein and vitamins.  The taste of most powders mixed into water turn my stomach, so when I'm on the go, I turn to ready to drink (RTD) shakes.  On a whim, I grabbed an Orgain from the cooler at the grocery co-op near my home last weekend and was incredibly surprised at how good it tasted.<br /><br />Since then, I've purchased several more and consumed them as snacks, pre-workout fuel and post-workout recovery.  I like them so much I've signed up to have several cases delivered to my home on a monthly basis.<br /><br />I've sampled dozens of brands, and none even come close on flavor or texture, especially given how low the sugar content is.  As an added bonus, the included vitamins, minerals and fruit/vegetable complexes alleviate some of my need to take vitamins in pill form.

review/summary: Worked great for sensitive stomach
review/text: I recently tried this shake in vanilla which I purchased at my local health food store and it tastes really good chilled. The best part about it is the minimal bad ingredients and additives that make it hard for me to consume any prepackaged drinks on the market right now. I used this as a meal replacement and was very impressed on how well it sat on my very sensitive stomach. I don't care for the soy protein factor or even the whey, since it would appeal more without these ingredients. I am wondering why the doctor who formulated this would add soy into something when cancer was an issue behind the product. Maybe a reformulation is in order, at least for me to continue consuming this. Very satisfied with this product and most of the ingredients but 4 stars for the noted exceptions.

review/text: In my opinion Orgain is by far the best power drink you can purchase. Although not classified as a power drink just look at the combination of ingredients and the amount of calories per drink,that will tell you the whole story. I especially appreciate the no bloating after effects and no sugary after taste. I have my order delivered on a monthly basis from Amazon at a decent discount.

review/summary: Amazing Drink!
review/text: This is by far the best protein drink I have ever tasted. This particular flavor is my favorite, because it is not think, like most protein shakes, and I love anything coffee flavor. I ordered several cases and they always got to me fast.<br /><br />This was the best thing for me during my pregnancy and also while nursing. Don't know what I'd do without it!

review/text: Searched long and hard for a protein shake that didn't have artificial ingredients (aspartame). Have tried this flavor and Choc. fudge, prefer this one. I drink these as my breakfast and find that it stave off hunger till mid morning (I am up at 5 am during the week).<br /><br />Perfect drink. Someone got it right finally.
