review/summary: One of the Best Candy Bars on the market!!!
review/text: I used to hate dark chocolate, and well Candy bars in general.  I came across this brand of Candy Bars while living in Vermont.  The chocolate just melts in your mouth and all the flavors blend flawlessly.  Anyone who has ever thought Dark Chocolate was bitter should try this line of candy bars to see what a good confectioner can do with dark chocolate.  I particularly like the blend of the crunchy almonds with the tart crisp fruit.  When you first bite into this candy bar you are only briefly aware of each distinctive ingredient as they compliment each other and blend so well together.  The added love poem (which changes) is a nice surprise.  Makes a wonderful gift.  I would recommend this candy bar and brand to everyone.

review/summary: MASTERPIECE CHOCOLATE
review/text: In my search for vegan chocolate (w/out milk or animal products), I found this chocolate at the local supermarket.  What a superb delight!  This chocolate is made with real rich Belgian chocolate, U.S. cherries & almonds.  The taste blew me away--really.  What an exquisite experience!  Only the equipment used to make this chocolate processes milk chocolate, otherwise this chocolate does not contain milk products, & I consider this one of the best chocolates of any kind I have ever tasted--ever!<br /><br />note: After I bought this chocolate, I found out refined sugar is not vegan (This chocolate cannot be called truly vegan since the refined & processed sugar is not vegan.  Animal bones are used in the processing).  Green & Black's Maya Gold Organic Chocolate is the closest thing to true vegan chocolate on the regular & wide commercial market today.  It does not contain refined sugar processed with animal bones.<br /><br />There is a beautiful love poem on the inside wrapper of each chocolate bar.

The cherries add just a slight enhancement to texture and taste.  Yum!  Need to go stock up!

review/summary: So good. So, so good.
review/text: Should you buy this: What, are you really thinking about this? BUY. BUY NOW.<br /><br />Pros: Very good chocolate *bar*<br /><br />Cons: ... the female chocoholics didn't leave me much.<br /><br />This is a great bar. It's not a pure chocolate bar, and it's only 55% cocoa content, so if you're a chocolate snob who likes to appreciate the flavor of a nice 100% Colombian dark chocolate bar or a German 85% w/ nibs, you may want to reconsider. I, however, like some variety in my bars, because if I'm going to sit around and eat 3.2 oz of chocolate bar, I'm going to want something else in there. Like some crunchy almonds and dried cherries. OH WAIT, that's this bar! It's a great bar and I loved the 3 that I got to eat. Sadly, the pair of chocoholics who have access to my fridge ensured that 3 of 12 was all I'd get. Completely unfair.<br /><br />If you're still on the fence, consider: at the time of this writing, 2 people have NOT given this a 5 star review. One says they're nothing special and you shouldn't count calories (I'm not), and the other is mad that a 55% bar is too sugary compared to the 85% she's used to. YOU DON'T SAY? Let me tell you, if I bought a 85% bar and it tasted like this, I'd be pretty mad. But it's 55%, which is borderline milk chocolate, and it's sweet, so please don't fault the bar when you like to taste the subtleties of bitter unsweetened chocolate. Which, by the way, if you're a TRUE chocoholic, you should definitely do. A few bites of excellent quality only-chocolate bar is quite the gastronomic experience. But that's not this; this is a chocolate bar you have a few squares of every now and then when you want something sweet, and this delivers. Mmmmmmm.

review/text: Unless you have the discipline of a saint, it's best to pull off one strip of this delicious chocolate and hide the rest. Dark chocolate is blended with finely slivered almonds and chewy dried Michigan cherries. The balance is the key; neither too sweet, too sticky, too crunchy. I was given one as a gift and I wanted to mow through it and had to hide the rest of the bar. It's just too good. If you like almonds and cherries and that flavor with chocolate, this is way too delicious.

review/text: Chocolove's dark chocolate is more like milk chocolate with a little edge. The cherries are nice and chewy and the almonds are especially crunchy. The chocolate is not waxy at all and melts easily in your mouth. I think what makes this chocolate bar especially good is the addition of vanilla. This chocolate also comes with a poem printed inside the wrapper. It might be fun to give this chocolate as a gift to someone who appreciates romance.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Going back to my smooth, rich, dark chocolate bars. BTW, the bulk is too expensive on amazon; it's cheaper to buy from walmart or your local grocery store.

review/summary: excellent pasta, but beware of expiration date!
review/text: in my opinion this brand is hands down among the best. Better than Barilla and also De Cecco, at a comparable price.<br />However, beware of the expiration date. On the side of the package there is a code indicating the manufacture date. For example "0 122" means 122nd day of 2010. I usually try not to buy pasta that is more than one year old, even if shelf life can be 2+ years (who wants to eat pasta that's been sitting somewhere for 2 years??)<br /><br />Unfortunately you can't verify the manufacture date prior to shipping, so it's a gamble. Too bad because it's really good pasta.

Overall the product is not great, but it's a company I'd keep my eye on.

review/summary: Great buy, great flavor, great gum!
review/text: I buy Xylitol chewing gum for my grandson, in particular, who had had extremely severe ECC at one time in his young life.<br /><br />When he was only 18 mos old he was diagnosed with ECC, at that time the ped dentist had him scheduled for $3400 worth of dental work - everything from extractions, to root canals, to straight fillings like 16 of them. But fortunately for him they could not arrange for an immediate operating room for the surgery... PTL!!<br /><br />Through research I discovered Xylitol, and as time progressed discovered Xyloburst with more Xylitol in them! Then just recently when buying this jar of the gum I found out I could buy it more economically in larger doses, 500 pieces.<br /><br />The ECC? My grandson is cavity-free now [he'll be five soon], did he have to have any dental work done? Yes, one extraction [he fell broke the root and it caused a draining abscess] and one filling [a very large cavity], cost? Under $200.<br /><br />We always carry Xyloburst chewing gum as well as one other flavor of Xylitol chewing gum everywhere with us now. Xyloburst has more Xylitol in it and it really tastes GREAT!<br /><br />Worth every penny spent on it! A great buy!

This forces quality/health-concious individuals to waste valuable time locating this information on the web.  (I've learned that if it's not listed in their ad to just keep on moving because every product I've ever had to FIND the information myself ended up being something I would NOT buy.  Quality manufacturers proudly 'boast' their ingredients.  Some do that as well as proudly list the 'unsavory' ingredients NOT in their product.)<br /><br />Other than having ARTIFICIAL flavors and TITANIUM DIOXIDE, it DOES have Xylitol and a robust cinnamon "flavor" but I'll be sticking with the Spry brand.

I have used it in pasta salads, caprese salad, and tonight I made bruschetta that I could not sit still to eat.

review/summary: The best dry pasta you can get.
review/text: From reading ingredients from typical pastas, one would probably think they are all the same. However, they can be dramatically different from each other. This one is the best I have ever had, which does not turn to mush as some cheap pastas do, and also is extremely consistent in its cooking time. With De Cecco, one does not need to test the pasta before the allotted time; one simply follows the directions for cooking time and it is perfect every time. I have never been able to do that with any other brand I have tried, and I have tried countless brands of pasta. The flavor is also better than other pastas, without being overpowering or drawing attention to itself. It is what pasta should be.<br /><br />It costs more than some other pastas, but it is worth much more than other pastas. This pasta absolutely deserves the highest possible rating, and compared with it, the best of any other brand, even brands that cost more, deserve no more than 3 stars. It is that much better than anything else you can find.<br /><br />The fusilli is my favorite shape, but all of the shapes are the same quality, and which shape one should use depends upon what one is making and one's personal preference.<br /><br />There is no reason to ever buy any other brand; they are all a disappointment after De Cecco.

So far, we haven't found a comparable pasta, especially for the price, and we eat a ton of the stuff. Perfect bite, perfect taste... if I had a gripe, I'd say that you have to cook it for one minute less than the recommended al dente time in order to get it properly al dente, but once you know that, you're golden.

review/summary: Soooo Good!
review/text: I am a recently diagnosed Gluten senistive person.  I went to my local grocery store and bought a number of gluten free products.  Hodgson Mill cookie mix was on sale at a very nic price.  Went home and whipped up a batch of peanut butter cookies.  Ummm lasted all of an hour and there is only two of us!  Very addictive but it is nice they include 5 different directions for different cookies you can make with this mix.  The box makes quite a few.  Even my dogs were begging for them!  Went back to the store and bought every box they had.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Taste just like classic chocolate chip cookies! Modified a little.
review/text: I bought this mix for my daughter's Cookie Monster party. What's a Cookie Monster party without chocolate chip cookies? She has recently had to become gluten-free because of allergies, and this was the first box of cookie mix I tried. There is no reason to try another! They were delicious and tasted just like classic chocolate chip cookies. I did modify it a tad, based on another review, by adding an extra egg and melting the butter partially before mixing. I don't know if it made a difference. Several parents at the party were asking me, "Are you sure these are gluten free?" So pleased to have a cookie mix for her(that can be made into several varieties of cookies) that tastes this good.

review/summary: Awesome, with a few tweaks...
review/text: I cook a lot, so to get foods to be the best they can be, I often have to tweak them a bit.  Cooking gluten-free for baked goods is a hassle, so these mixes come in handy.  This one in particular, I have had great success with.  The recipe calls for vegetable shortening, which I refuse to use.  So, melt the butter, as directed, and then add in some Canola oil, which I understand is also naturally gluten-free (same amount as the shortening would have been).  I also add one more egg to the mix, to keep the moisture and to keep it together better.  Result:  perfect cookies.  Not too dry, not crumbly, excellent.  The taste of this particular product is also very nice.  I don't bother squishing them down.  My family likes the "mountain" effect of spooned dough.  The entire cookies seems to cook very well in the appointed 15 minutes. I usually wait until there is a little brownish ring around the base, then they are usually all the way done.

review/summary: These gf cookies are TOO good!
review/text: I was diagnosed gluten intolerant in the mid to late 80's & these are some of the best GF cookies I've made from a mix.  I did the peanut butter & a few chocolate chips and oh wow...are they good!!  They only lasted a few days & it's just me!  Although I usually share my baked stuff with my neighbor...have made them 3 times & I haven't been able to give part with a single cookie!  :o)

review/summary: I think its great!
review/text: I bought this mix a few nights ago. Since its SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than most of the other brands out there I figured it was worth a shot... I thought it was REALLY tasty. Ive read several, VERY mixed reviews on this product and cant quite figure what the issue may be. I did notice that the box I bought reads "new and improved" where the box in this picture simply reads "new".... maybe they made a change to the mix??? .... I say its worth a shot. I liked it a lot and will use this as my go-to/easy/fast mix from now on.

review/summary: Very dry
review/text: I made the peanut butter version.  The taste was fine but VERY dry and crumbly. When I saw how dry the first batch was, I doubled the butter---I'm new to baking GF and don't really understand the flours and chemistry, nor do I know why GF baked goods are usually SO dry but adding butter didn't solve it, it just made it more buttery tasting.

review/summary: My kids love it!
review/text: My kids love this juice.  However it's not such a great value in the big bottle.  We buy the small sippy bottles version which are the best and leak proof bottles you'll ever find.  No other sippy cup comes close.  They are very convenient and reusable.  Perfect for the little hands.  The large bottle is fine, but I just buy cheaper organic juice in a local store and water it down myself for the refills (toddlers should not drink straight juice which is bad for their teeth, etc.)

review/text: I was looking for a chicken/duck dog treat that isnt made in China (most of the popular ones state that they are on their packaging). This one, with its dual French/English labeling and Free Range title, appeared to be a North American free-range organic-type natural product. Especially given the price. But it is NOT, it is also made in China. Upon closer inspection it says this product has no ADDED hormones, antibiotics, preservatives... but it doesnt say the product is FREE OF these additives. I feel duped, and I am returning.  I can get the same China-quality for half the price without being taken for a ride.

review/summary: Highest currency
review/text: Dogs know which treats they like best.  These are my dog's very favorite so I refer to them by saying, "I'll give you a million dollars."  Now that he knows this phrase, it gets him moving when he's reluctant to get in the car, or helps change his mind about an agility obstacle that makes him nervous.  I also use these as high-value treats for classical conditioning; I give these out when my dog is meeting a new person, or when I'm talking to a neighbor in the backyard, to create positive associations so he's less likely to bark.  Of course he also loves getting these just as a treat.  A bag of these treats can be stretched by cutting each one into about 3 pieces to use for training (big enough to still be chewy instead of swallowed whole), but I leave some whole for regular treats.  A whole one is big enough that my dog will carry it away to eat, and he will guard it from another dog, so be aware of that if your dog is a resource guarder.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying these.  Don't be fooled by the tear notch above the zipper; when I open the bag this way the zipper ends up getting ripped.  Cut the bag open above the zipper to make sure you can reseal it.  The thick plastic keeps the treats fresh.

review/summary: Dog Treats
review/text: These Chicken and Sweet Potato dog treats are the all time favorite in our home...not for me but for my dogs.  I was so happy to see them at such a great price, but when I received them I found that all 5 bags (2 priced at regular price) all had expired dates on them and they were not soft but very hard.  They all expired last year.  I realize they're dogs, and I realize the body parts they lick can't be any worse than some expired dog treats, but knowing that most dog treats, including these, come from China, and with the pet food issues that we have had, I just think that the expiration dates should be noted on the item description, and let the buyer beware. Otherwise, bar none my dogs love these treats, I shouldn't make that public than they will really go up in price and be even more difficult to find!

review/summary: This is the secret of REAL theater flavor
review/text: I've done a lot of research and I've tried a lot of products.  This is it.  I have a friend that owns a movie theater and he told me this is what is used.  There are slight variations in theaters across the nation but this is the product used.  He said they do not use real butter because it melts down the popcorn when it is hot.  Real butter also tastes funny, yes, it's true.  He said the theater tried it for a month and customers would come back complaining that the butter tasted funny and get a refund.  The topping is the way to go.<br /><br />Trade secret number #2:  Flavorcol.  You won't get that salty seasoned flavor from this topping alone.  Nor from a combination of this topping and salt.  Flavorcol is a salt seasoning that is put in the mix while popping.  Get it use it.<br /><br />Oh yeah, there's a 3rd secret too: Use red coconut oil.  It's similar to what McDonald's uses.  Pay attention to how similar the smell of the nuggets frying and popcorn is.  That smell in the movie theater is actually the coconut oil frying.<br /><br />Never said it was healthy.

review/text: First off, I'm not one to leave reviews. Only if a product is extremely good or extremely bad. And as long as I've been an Amazon customer -- going on a decade or so now? -- this is my first review of a product.<br /><br />I'd like to consider myself a bit of a popcorn connoisseur. I love popcorn, but I'm extremely picky. It's either too stale tasting, not salty enough, too salty, not enough butter, too buttery -- you get the idea.<br /><br />Well, as the title suggests, three li'l words describe this butter to a T. It is unbelievably, incredibly, stupendously fantastic! This, combined with some Great Northern Popcorn make, in this lone popcorn fanatic's perception at least, sheer perfection.<br /><br />I've had some great movie theater popcorn in my day, and this emulates, if not actually TRUMPS, the best I've had. All the way down to the tickly aftertaste senstation you get in the back of your throat. It's dangerously addicting. If you like movie theater popcorn, this is quite simply THE one to buy.

review/summary: Entirely Adequate
review/text: I bought this product as part of my quest to find a really buttery topping for microwave popcorn. This is the third brand of oil that I have purchased and I think I will keep looking.<br /><br />What one gets is a thick, creamy emulsion with a faint buttery taste. I found pronounced creamy overtones in a raw tasting. It will slightly separate on standing so, even though the label does not say so, "Shake Well Before Using."<br /><br />As expected, adding this oil to freshly popped popcorn produces an oily, semi-creamy, and very slightly buttery finished product. Adding plain popping salt completes the process for a very likeable popcorn.<br /><br />This product is not in the same class a movie-theater style popcorn, but would easily satisfy someone looking for an alternative flavor profile. The creamy texture of the oil gives the finished popcorn a nice, silky mouth-feel.

review/text: For years my husband loved the movie theater pop corn we grew up with, but hated that it cost us, as a family, $35.00 to have it at the theater, without the cost of the movie added with it.  I finally researched and picked up a Funtime 8oz tabletop machine with funtime popcorn kits. I cannot tho stress how much this BUTTERY, butter flavored popcorn topping has really finished the whole process for enjoying TRUE Movie theater tasting pop corn.  The texture and taste of the popcorn with this on it is EXACTLY as the theaters.  You have found the correct topping, if the eaxct, true movie butter flavor is what you are looking for.  I heat mine up in a coffee mug in the microwave, and spoon dribble it over a half filled box of popcorn, and then fill it full, topping it off with more drizzled.  Thank you for selling this product!!

review/text: Super Yummy as good or better than any Theater Butter topping! The first jug was damaged so the seller is supposed to refund the purchase price. We have an 8oz popcorn machine and I cannot even imagine not having this topping now it is very buttery and tastes great I keep it in a squeeze bottle in the popcorn machine so the warming light will keep it nice and warm. If you want great butter taste for me this was it I have my working jug of topping and a backup jug it's that good!

review/text: It's thick and taste just like real movie theater popcorn butter.<br />It's not salted, the popcorn salt is perfect for this butter topping. My only concern is that there is no expiration date on the container. I need to know how long is the shelf life of the unused portion.<br />I am disapppointed that there is no customer service number on the container for any consumer questions.

review/text: I love the taste of this. I used it to pop my corn in. It made the popcorn all buttery. I have to deduct a star because when it gets cool it leaves that film that crisco-like shortenings do on the roof of your mouth. I hate that. And it has trans-fats.

review/summary: Not Really Butter Flavored
review/text: Ordered this product as a supplement to my concession operation.  On receipt, I put it on some popcorn I'd made for friends as a test run.  Of the six people who tried it (myself included), four thought the popcorn tasted oily and that it actually detracted from the taste of the popcorn.  The topping was put on in incremental amounts.  Of the six testers, no one thought it made the popcorn better.  Four thought it negatively affected the popcorn and the other two were neutral.  I will most likely not be purchasing this product in the future.

review/summary: Good Topping
review/text: This butter like topping is very good.  I did read some reviews before purchasing which did sway in my decision to buy this topping for my home popcorn.  Most of the reviews were positive, some negative but the positive outweighed the negative, therefore, I decided to buy some.  Some reviewers said it tastes just like at the movies and some said it does not, but more said it did than not.  In my opinion this topping is not an exact match in taste as the butter topping they use in the theaters, or at least in my area.  I live in the suburbs of Los Angeles and go to the movies in various locations in Southern California.  It is possible that the other reviewers who say this taste just like at the theater visit theaters that do use this or one just like it.  I go to the movies at either Edwards Cinema (Regal) or AMC theaters.  This topping is good but not an exact match.  Someone mentioned Mor Gold is creamier and just like the theater.  I found that Wabash Butter Flavored Topping actually is creamy too, at least compared to that at the theaters that I go to the movies.  The butter topping at the theaters that I visit is very thin and very liquidy actually, which makes this stuff seem to be creamy and thick.  I think people are accustomed to "movie butter" topping and anything less or different is not acceptable.  For awhile I was melting real butter and putting in on the popcorn but honestly, even if real butter is higher quality and the real thing, I can't get used to butter on my popcorn and went on the quest of this synthetic like topping that is used at movie theaters.  Although this is not an exact match am I happy with this product?  Yes I am, is the answer.  This topping actually does taste like butter but not exactly. If it was exactly like butter taste I'd not use it any longer but it is not just like butter but has some taste properties.  It falls somewhere between real butter taste and that synthetic stuff from the movie theater that I like so much.  Heck I might use this on corn on the cob and see how it is.  I have no complaints about this stuff at all and a little goes a long way.  I just purchased this recently, came the other day and I tried it out on some popcorn.  Tasted good.  So this will last me a long time. When it's all said and done I might try some of that O'Dell brand, I heard good things about it.  So bottom line is I rather get an exact taste copy as the kind I am used to at the theater but I can say this is very good stuff.  Would I buy it again? Yes I would but I'd compare O'Dell brand first and after comparing the two I'd go for the one I like best.  I think that Amazon actually carries O'Dell also so you might want to look into it.

review/text: An excellent product that is exactly the same as used in most theaters to flavor their popcorn.  Economically priced, this canola oil based flavoring adds a smooth, rich flavor to a bucket of homemade popcorn.  The canola oil offers many health advantages over that great tasting wad of real butter, and has the same wonderful flavor.

review/summary: Exactly what I was looking for...
review/text: I love popcorn at the local movieplexes (extra butter, please.)  When I get below the "butter layer," I'm always a little sad, but am usually pretty engaged in the movie, and don't care as much.  If you know what I'm talking about, then I can cut to the chase.  Barring health concerns (I've no idea how bad this is calorie-wise or fats-wise, really), THIS is the stuff you want!!<br /><br />I wanted to imitate the movie theater experience at home, so I bought a popcorn popper on a whim at a discount web retailer. At a friend's behest, I bought a jar of orange-ish coconut oil (turns yellow as it spreads out, and looks really cool on a metal spoon). That gave me the movie theater SMELL, and an important component of the overall flavor.<br /><br />One of the reviewers here recommends coconut oil, this stuff, and Flavacol, and for folks that want butter flavor without the oil, Flavacol is fantastic, but it really didn't get me to the movie theater experience on its own.  I'm keeping the box I bought, anyway, in case someone doesn't want this "butter" stuff.  I have no idea how unhealthy it really is.<br /><br />This topping really made all of the difference in the world, in terms of getting the movieplex experience.  I bought a separate squirter from Amazon (you can probably find it in the list of things people also bought when they bought this.)  It fit perfectly and really simplified the "butter" application.  You could probably put this on microwave popcorn and get really close to the theater experience.<br /><br />This topping is not really butter, obviously.  Folks who buy it thinking otherwise will hopefully learn to read titles and labels more closely.<br /><br />I love this stuff. Can't recommend it enough.

review/text: I purchased this based on the rave reviews. I am thinking that either I got a bad batch or a lot of people just love the taste of flavorless oil. I am not a picky person. If this even remotely had a good flavor I would have been fine with it. But everyone who tried it agreed that it made the popcorn taste worse and not better and added almost no flavor at all. I wish I could have tasted the product before I purchased it. So, I guess I am out about $25.

Unfortunately, I was unable to remove the plastic top which does not unscrew.  It just has a flip top cap with a single hole in it and ended up just shaking it by drops into the measuring cup which was messy and a hassle.

review/summary: King of the green
review/text: I was literally not prepared for the exquisite and lively flavors that this brew offered as it instantly became my favorite Rooibos tea. This organic Rooibos makes the perfect daily cup of tea that can be enjoyed in any quantity. African herbal tea is rich in many essential natural elements as it is not allowed to oxidize making the flavor more fruity and literally weightless. This tastes like a cross between soft black and green tea, a gorgeous pumpkin color when brewed and since it's caffeine free I can drink myself silly before bedtime and it has not kept me up yet. The subtle richness of soft pulpy mellow woods is silky with a pleasant sparkling green aftertaste which I find myself craving all the time.<br /><br />So far every flavor of Numi I have tired proved to be a winner and a cup of high quality in both flavor and taste is always guaranteed and only a short boil of water away. After a hectic day this is the best calming and tranquil beverage that is not only delicious but also so healthy!<br /><br />- Kasia S.

It's not fancy, but it is above average.<br />Strong flavored that will stand up to milk and sugar if you like. Think Irish<br />breakfast commercial blends and you have an idea of the typical flavor.<br />If you're a tea drinker, think a Anhui Province medium grade Chuen Cha.<br /><br />Overall a great bang for your buck if you are a tea drinker who isn't afraid<br />of loose leaf preparations. The packaging concerns are pretty groundless. If you're<br />drinking loose leaf tea, odds are you have a few jars or air tight tea containers.<br /><br />The packaging itself is good, eco-friendly, seals well but you might want to put half<br />(or more) into a air tight container then use the stuff left in the bag first.<br />This way you will avoid any flavor degradation when at the bottom of the bag<br />from oxidation over time, if you don't use this tea daily or regular like.<br /><br />It is not a first flush premier estate tea. It is splendid tasting and a great value.<br />Eco-friendly and organic are just valuable perks to the world conscious.

review/summary: Is this really Keemun Congou?
review/text: I have been drinking Keemun Congou tea for more than 20 years. My first taste of Keemun was from Harrod's and the bright red color and the fabulous bouquet of Keemun made me a fan for life. In my opinion, the taste should be slightly astringent but sweet on your tongue. I love to open my jar of tea in the morning and inhale the slightly smoky, winey aroma of my tea much like coffee drinkers enjoy the smell of a newly opened can of coffee. Keemun really is the Bordeaux of tea.<br />Then the inevitable finally occurred the company I normally buy my Keemun tea from (Special Teas) went out of business, selling out to Teavana and Teavana has chosen not to carry the Keemun I prefer. Alas I found myself looking for a tea to replace the now unavailable Special Tea's Keemun, so I bought two pounds of the Davidson's Keemun because the price was right. Unfortunately this tea is nothing like the Keemun I love and look forward to every morning. The Davidson Keemun smells green and unfermented, almost like a green tea or perhaps slightly fermented like an oolong. The brew does not have that slight smokiness to it and is not sweet on my tongue.<br />I tried brewing it with more tea but that tasted like I had just used more green straw (someone equated it to being barny) and was not at all pleasing even to my husband who is less particular. In the end I am wondering what to do with the enormous amount of tea I have left and have to give this product a thumbs down.

review/summary: Wish I'd read the reviews first.
review/text: Well, what they said.  Been drinking Keemun for years and love it, but this is just bland, and now I've got a pound of it.  Find something else.

review/summary: Junk, don't waste your money
review/text: Junk tea.  20% is twigs and chunks of leaves that aren't even rolled.  First one I ordered came in a zip top bag and was OK.  Not a great Keemun (my daily drink), but okay for my morning thermos on the ride in to work.  It came in a plastic coated paper bag with a zip top.  I ran out and decided to order some more.  The second batch (unfortunately I ordered 3...big mistake) came in plastic lined paper roll-down bags like shown in the image.  And it is junk.  I can't even drink it.  It has no flavor.  Forget the fact that there is almost none of the signature Keemun flavor.  There is almost no flavor at all!  If you want to convince somebody that loose leaf tea is worse than Lipton tea bags, this is the stuff to get.

review/text: Davidson's bulk Keemun tea can't be beat! Great taste and good price -- especially for organic tea. Packaging is simple and recyclable.

review/summary: good smell but poor quality
review/text: First, I'd like do a math for the potential buyers. 13 dollars for 16 Oz means 77 Chinese Yuan for 500g.  In Beijing, capital of China, this is the price for a low or middle-low level Keemun Congou (Qi Men Hong Cha).  So don't expect a super high quality.<br /><br />As one previous reviewer said, there are too many twigs and other dirty branches.  But if you know the produce process, you will accept it considering the low price ......<br /><br />Anyway, the smell is good and the same as what I bought in China.<br /><br />Overall, I'd like to say this is a good everyday use red tea.

review/summary: Not my favorite
review/text: I love Davidson's tea in general, but I won't be purchasing this again. This black tea doesn't have much body and has a rather unpleasant earthy taste (perhaps that is a correct characteristic of Keemon Congou?). It is much more drinkable with the addition of fresh mint or a fruit tea so I have been using it that way.

review/summary: Disappointing -- not much flavor
review/text: I'd previously tried Davidson's Earl Grey tea and was pretty happy with it, so I decided to order a different variety.  In retrospect, I think the Earl Grey only works because it's so heavy on the Bergamot.  That hides the fact that the tea itself doesn't have much flavor.  The Keemun has nothing to hide behind, and tastes like nothing much.  Too bad!  What to do with a pound of mediocre tea?

review/summary: really good tea
review/text: My daughter and I are really enjoying this tea.  It has that great Keemun flavor without the exorbitant price of our local tea shop.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: not my cup of tea
review/text: I'm really disappointed in this tea.  It's got really, really strong tobacco and earthy (read: barnyard) flavors.  I've decided to use it as a filler with some other bulk tea I have . . . its the only way I can use this tea.<br /><br />I will not purchase this tea again, nor will I suggest it to anyone I like.  I'd rather shell out the few extra bucks for a better tasting keemun and drink it less often, than drink this stuff daily.  Insert "Sad Trombone" sound effect here.
