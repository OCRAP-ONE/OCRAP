review/summary: Sweet and delish
review/text: Last fall I bought a slew of different protein bar brands to see which I liked the most.  Of the many brands I tried, most all were roughly the same in taste, texture, etc.  But these Honey Stingers stood out to me.  They have a much smoother texture, and have a great sweetness to them that really makes them taste great.  I'm a huge fan... gonna by a bunch more boxes for snacks and workouts.

review/summary: Love these, but only got 11 of 12 packets.
review/text: When I opened the package, I only found 11 packets of the Honey Stingers. There should have been 12. I counted and re-counted 4 times to be sure. The packets were in a thin cardboard display box, wrapped in a sealed plastic bag, and shipped in a sturdy cardboard box. I don't really want to go through the hassle of returning the item, so I guess I'm out a pack.  It'd be nice if amazon shipped me one more packet! ;-)

review/summary: Honey Stingers....the perfect natural energy
review/text: These are the most awesome little energy snack possible!  Brought a box of these on a hunt for a week with some buddies for the first time...along with a box of Sharkies. Prior to this, Sharkies where our mainstay when needing a boost and energy replacement.  Have to say, even the Sharkies fan in the group had to admit Honey Stingers fairly surpassed Sharkies in both taste and performance.  Will still probably bring both next time for variety, but definitely twice as many Honey Stingers.  Honey IS the perfect food!

review/summary: Dangerously delicious
review/text: I love the taste of these peppermint bark chocolate squares. They've got just the right of mintiness mixed into creamy white chocolate laid over a milk chocolate base. I love how the peppermint flavouring come from actual pieces of peppermint that have been chopped up into tiny pieces. It adds a delightful crunch to each bite.<br /><br />The most unfortunate thing about these is how caloric they are - if you don't watch out, you can find yourself eating several of these in a sitting. Perhaps it is a good thing they're seasonal after all!<br /><br />After running out of these, I picked up something I thought was the same at a local Target -- however, it turned out to have a dark chocolate base (the difference in packaging is very subtle, the red stripes are darker marron red instead of a brighter candy cane red) and wasn't nearly as good as these.

review/summary: good for baking, not for PST
review/text: I used these Frontier brand seeds (ordered from amazon) on a couple of occasions recently for tea and was NOT impressed.  I order the same frontier seeds from other vendors and they are good quality for PST, but maybe this batch of froniter seeds that amazon currently has (in their Tennessee warehouse) have been washed or something.  They do not do the job at all.  Quite unfortunate really, considering the price and prime shipping.<br /><br />I will reorder in about 6 weeks and update this review then on the quality of the seeds when I try them again.  I hope this will be useful advice, leave a comment if you have any questions about other vendors and such.<br /><br />EDIT: I just received another order 03/02/12,  and unfortunately they are the same seeds as before.  The seeds are almost all grey with only a couple of black seeds here and there.  The good quality frontier seeds are the other way around ie: mostly black with some grey seeds.

review/summary: Great for cooking
review/text: These seeds arrived just in time for my annual bake sale.  Some reviewers were claiming that these seeds were dirty and needed to be washed, and others claim they're clean as a whistle.  I can tell you with certainty that mine were very well washed which means I didn't have to do so before they went into my famous poppy seed rolls and cakes.  I think the inconsistency is due to Frontier being a co-op seed company.  They likely buy from various sources, some of which have dirty seeds, and some of which pre-wash.

review/summary: Great Quality Incredible Prices!!!!
review/text: For anyone who does any cooking that involves poppy seeds, it makes total sense to buy in semi-bulk.<br /><br />For the cost of two pounds of these high quality Frontier seeds, you might be able to buy a few ounces (2-3 bottles) from your local grocery store.<br /><br />There are many great recipes from Eastern Europe that use lots and lots of these tasty seeds.  I haven't bothered trying to buy in super-bulk yet, like the 70 lbs bags!  But I might in the near future :)<br /><br />I should offer a warning to people who are subjected to random urinalyses: at work, in the military or on probation: some of the recipes that call for a large amounts of poppy seeds (like Hungarian "Beiglis") can cause a positive result for opiate use.<br /><br />I run these tests for people in my department and for some employees, it can cause serious problems, so please be careful!  I unofficially tested myself after eating a Czech Kolache, and my pee was positive for opiates for four days!! (using the OPI2000 indicator kit)<br /><br />Probably best not to bring these dishes in to work and share them with your co-workers!  They covered this on Myth-Busters I heard, and its absolutely true.

As some of the other reviewers described, they have almost a "dirty" taste to them and not much normal poppy seed flavor.  They are not good for baking.  I'm wondering if they are used for something else like poppy tea which would explain their high ratings by others. I ended up throwing out both bags.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cheap price.<br />Non-irradiated.<br />Fast delivery.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Poor taste.<br />Not baking/eating quality.<br />Unusable for eating/cooking (so cheap price doesn't really matter.)

I don't like buying  a product expecting one thing and then getting something else.  If you're connected with Frontier somehow, at least offer an explanation why the label/packaging would be different.

review/summary: An Overview of my relationship with these seeds.
review/text: Having first purchased these about a year ago, they were fantastic for all my poppy seed needs. They were raw, dirty, unwashed, and tasty. However, this has not been the case as of recently. The seeds were dry, flavorless compared to their predecessors, and appear to have been rinsed of flavor already. Also, some times they sent me something different than frontier seeds, an apparently common complaint on here. Overall, NFPST.

review/summary: very clean!  sweet nutty taste
review/text: just to be SURE these were REALLY REALLY CLEAN, i washed a couple of hundred grams very carefully for about ten minutes and then let them dry, and compared them to the same seeds out of the same package without my personal treatment.  they are exactly the same color and consistency, so i would judge that the frontier seeds straight out of the bag do not have any RESIDUE on the exterior of the seed.  lovely, nice, sweet, nutty taste, chock full of serious nutrition (good-for-ya oils and such, pretty sure these are an omega source among other things).  not great for drinks but with baking, i'd go for it.  i snacked on a few after i washed them, as well as drinking the water to be sure it was clean and flavorless, as i expected.  wonderful crunchy stuff.<br /><br />since i'm a little obsessive about getting for the best and freshest quality i can get, i did buy some special somiverum seeds strictly to start my own garden.  I understand they grow quickly so hopefully in another season i'll have my own seed pods and be making the best lemon poppy seed muffins in town.  Time will tell!  yum!!!!!

Frontier is the company that is usually sold in upscale organic grocery stores, and they're much cheaper buying direct from here.<br /><br />These seeds are also viable- they have slow germination rate, but with 10,000 seeds you can have a 10% germination rate and still get 1,000 plants! Just seed by broadcasting in the garden, and you'll get a number of beautiful poppy flowers a few months later.

I wanted to complain to Frontier but then I realized they ll probably say that these are not meant for making tea.<br /><br />Will not order again unless they assure me that these are truly whole, unprocessed seeds.

I am not sure if it is Amazon's fault or the 3rd party seller for selling the product under a false name.  Anyway, if you want to order the frontier brand, make sure you order directly from Amazon...just b/c you order it from the Amazon website does not mean that you are ordering it from Amazon, so BEWARE!

review/summary: Strong smell/flavour.
review/text: The flavour and smell is very strong, unlike any other seeds I've tried. I would describe the smell/taste as a spicy, maybe a little acidic. I don't know where the spiciness comes from, it is really strong and really unlike anything I've ever had. I would not describe the taste as earthy, earthy tasting to me is like a tea that tastes like leaves, but it is possible that this flavor is earthy to others. If you are using many at a time just be aware they are strong.<br /><br />They are packaged tightly, which is convenient for storage. Flat, vacuum-sealed? bags which can be slid in just about anywhere.<br /><br />**Edit**<br />Have to change my review from 4 to two stars.<br />I had some pasta the other day and the (red) sauce tasted exactly like these poppy seeds. Today I opened a bag and noticed little red  or orange flecks. It look like there is something added to these, which would describe the strange smell, which is not natural.<br /><br />I rinsed them, but they rinsed *very clean so it it's not an oily residue that is causing this, which they haven't (rinsed clean) in the past.<br />I am not sure what is going on, but I personally, will not be using these anymore - this whole thing is just freaking me out.

review/text: This was a complete waste of $15. It was the correct product (I noticed some reviews said they got a different brand than what they ordered) but I wish it wasn't! First time I used half of one bag... just to get a feel for the product-- nothing. A couple days later I used the rest of the 1 1/2 lbs and got nothing whatsoever. Complete disappointment. I'd stick with McCormick!

review/summary: Like flan? Stay away from these cookies.
review/text: I got a simple philosophy with food.  If the food is bad for you, it better taste good.  Why else eat something loaded with carbs and fat?  These cookies follow the model of bad-tasting and bad-for-you, so why eat it?<br /><br />Don't be tricked.  These things are packaged as "gourmet," are from a small company that made me believe it was some small but caring mom-and-pop company, and who doesn't love flan?  I can't see how these are gourmet considering how bad they taste, maybe the company is caring but the cookies don't taste like it, and the best things about flan are the texture and the decadent sweet fatty taste.  You don't get any of it with this.<br /><br />These cookies taste like there's too much flour.  They're like butter cookies where someone took out 1/2 the sugar and put in too much flour.  It's got a pasty texture and the taste doesn't compare to real flan.  The closest comparison I can give is they taste like bad shortbread. If figure if something is going to be close to flan in cookie-form, it's got to be real flan put into some type of pastry to keep it from falling apart.  These cookies are just pasty and dry.

review/text: Sodastream lemonade is the perfect drink for summer, alone or as a mixer for cocktails (this + iced tea vodka and a mint leaf = the perfect summer cookout drink!).  Those expecting traditional lemonade will be confused but if you love the slightly fizzy and tart (not sweet) lemonade you can get in parts of Europe, this is just the thing.<br /><br />I love our Sodastream so much that I got another to keep at my office.  Now I drink plenty of fluids throughout the day without popping $1 each time into a vending machine.  The fact that this is only 35 calories per 8 oz. serving is a giant plus.

review/summary: A taste of heaven in a bottle
review/text: Based on a recommendation, I purchased an order of Claude's Brisket Marinade through Amazon and tried it on a brisket. This is a cut of beef I've never used before, but after tasting the mouthwatering deliciousness of this cut and Claude's, I am hooked. Last week I bought a second brisket and cooked it with the same amazing results. The recipe is on the bottle, however, there's a more in-depth recipe on the Claude's website, plus a brisket salad recipe and others.<br /><br />While the recipe suggests a roasting temperature of 300 degrees, I chose to cook the meat in a 225 degree oven--8 hours for a four pound brisket. I used a Le Creuset roasting pan with a layer of foil placed between the pan and the cover. No juices cooked away and the result was a fork-tender cut of meat.<br /><br />Honestly, this is the best marinade I've ever tasted.

review/text: This is one of the best Brisket Marinades on the market. I soak my brisket in it overnight, drain most of the juice off (not all) and then cook my brisket at 250 for 4-6hrs (depends on the size). If your brisket is tough, then cook it longer. It is done when you can pull it apart with a fork.<br />I will never stop using this marinade. Every time I move I have to special order it through my grocery store, but now with Amazon I can get it delivered directly to my house no matter where I live. I highly recommend this marinade to anyone!

review/summary: I won't eat a steak without it.
review/text: I've used Claud's for years.  I use it on steaks, grilled fish, chicken, and burgers.  I even put a little in my purple hull peas.  It is unbelievable (especially when combined with lemon pepper)!  DO NOT MARINATE with this or you'll ruin your food (except for brisket).  Let it sit no longer than 10 minutes.  Then rub lemon pepper on the meat, and grill.<br /><br />Larger bottles can be purchased from the manufactor's website, but it works better in smaller ones.  The garlic, onions, and other solid particles settle.  You have to pour immediately after shaking.  If the bottle is too big, you're only pouring the liquid smoke off the top.  These small bottles are perfect and its worth paying the extra $ per ounce.

review/summary: Great Brisket Marinade
review/text: We purchased the last two bottles Claude's Brisket Marinade on clearance from Kroger.  After using both bottles we were not able to find this product anywhere locally.  We were thrilled to find it at Amazon.com and ordered six bottles.  In our opinion there is not a better brisket sauce in existence.  Also the price was right at $17.85 for six bottles. ($2.98 each) We marinated the whole brisket overnite then placed the brisket and sauce in a covered roasting pan and placed in the oven which is set at 300 degrees.  We cook for 6 to 7 hours, then raise the oven to 350 and cook uncovered for 15 minutes more.  This browns the meats and fats.  Slice or shred and serve anyway you want...  Shreded on a roll with coleslaw...  Sliced as a steak and served with sauce in a plate.... On a roll with peppers, onions and provolone cheese...  Served with peppers, onions and eggs for breakfast...  super versatile!  It is to die for.  Our highest recommendation.

review/text: A friend had a party several years ago and the whole house had this wonderful aroma when we walked in.  After tasting the most succulent meat I've ever had in my life, I asked her for the recipe.  How easy can you get?  I use 2 ounces for every pound of meat and let it marinate overnight in the sauce before cooking it slow and low.  One key is to leave the fat on the brisket while cooking it and trim it off before serving.  You'll never use another sauce after trying this one.

review/text: This is without a doubt the best instant oatmeal on the market!  I have been buying this at my local Sav-a-Lot but they quit carrying it and I can't find it in the rural area I live in.  I'm glad to find it here, but it is really overpriced.  I was getting a box of five packets for 50 cents!  Worth it though, at least until I can find another grocery store that carries it.  I have tried many of the other flavors as well.  All are good, but the maple brown sugar is my favorite.  It cooks up like the old fashioned oats...not mushy like the other brands.  Try it with just a few walnuts added in.  The flax seeds in it are a good source of nutrients, and make it interesting to eat too.  It fills me up with no mid-morning crash.  Love it.

review/summary: Quality and Affordable. An excellent adition to any spice cabinet!
review/text: I was introduced to Durkee spices some years back and I can affirm that any good cook will understand that not all spices are made the same way. Unfortunately many spices in today's markets consist of fillers you wouldn't feed your family, nor expect them to be in a spice labeled celery seed. My mother was a gourmet chef and renowned for her cooking excellence and she would diligently go through every product, every ingredient she used to understand exactly what she was feeding her family. Rarely would she not simply make it herself and be in the kitchen for hours or not days. Never did anything "processed" find its way into our house. Chicken stock came from a stainless pot with chicken, fresh veggies and water. While I enjoy fresh home cooked meals I simply do not have the time or patience to go through all that. My mother would roll over in her grave if she thought I'd feed my family spaghetti sauce out of a jar! However this does not mean I have to substitute on quality.<br /><br />Durkee offers a fine product, without fillers that gets you as close to selecting and grinding up the seeds as possible, without all the work. There 2 pack of 16 ounce containers of ground celery seed (2 total pounds) is a product that does not skimp on quality or taste. Personally I would rather chop up some celery whenever possible if I was going to make some soup. I actually bought this because I believe in supplementing my sometime poor nutritional choices when traveling or rushed. Instead of paying $10 for a bottle of 100 pills of celery seed extract (approximately one ounce total per bottle), I simply use my capsule machine to make myself some home made supplements. The savings are substantial, its something I know what I am getting and there are no questions on quality. Some other celery seed spices you "taste" all day and I have never had any complaints about halitosis.<br /><br />This is a fine product that is consistent throughout, finely ground, and even tastes great in soups, if that's what you are looking for. The Durkee brand has always been well-received in my house as a quality spice. So regardless if you plan to use this to make your own supplements such as I do, or simply as a spice, this is a fine product and a great deal.

review/summary: Nestle Nido
review/text: I am writing this review because I feel that the only other review here is not justified. It says on the packaging that it is whole milk powder and it should be assumed that it will be just that. I have been interested in purchasing this product for some time and recently found it at a grocery store. I have not had good luck finding a quality powdered milk and this product has satisfied my desire for a quality powdered milk. It has a good flavor and does not taste stale or like cardboard. Of the brands of powdered milk I have tried, many taste so bad I cannot even consume it when I backpack. This is bad because, when backpacking, I need to eat all I can and often will eat all I can and have. Bringing powdered milk I won't drink is a waste of weight I carry and calories I'll never get. I have seriously eaten grape nuts with water because my powdered milk was so stale. This product has a nice rich and creamy flavor that the non-fat milk powders don't have. I prepared this product and drank the result immediately, without any refrigeration and it was already excellent. I think the only other milk powder that I have drank that was good was the carnation non-fat milk. Also, I have used vanilla carnation breakfast drink in place of powdered milk because it works as a milk substitute on the trail. I enjoy this Nido whole milk powder because it is loaded with calories and also because it can be very useful in preparing a number of different normal every day dishes or possibly ethnic at home, such as ice cream, kulfi, or when you want to thicken dairy based foods. I also drink whole milk on a normal basis and prefer to have the fat anyway. However, if I didn't prefer the fat, I would choose this over a bad tasting stale milk powder any day.

review/summary: Delicious creamy powdered milk
review/text: For years I have tried to find powdered milk as a 'back up' to my normal milk (I hasten to add that I usually prefer semi-skimmed).<br />I have tried what seems like every product under the sun and the majority are skimmed milk version....why is that??<br />No matter where I buy it from they all taste diabolical to be perfectly honest.<br />I would prefer to drink my tea black rather than suffer, what I can only describe as coloured water.<br />I went into a local Asian Supermarket in Portsmouth, Hampshire, England and saw Nestle Nido for sale.<br />As always I bought a small tin to try and fully expected to do the same with this as the others....bin it.<br />Was I in for a shock....it is gorgeous!!<br />It is now used in our household's cereal, tea, coffee etc and we also drink it on its own.<br />Anyone who says that this is a horrible product or tasteless etc should have a medical referral to get their taste buds examined.<br />I cannot recommend it highly enough. 5+ stars.

review/summary: Good if you need gluten-free
review/text: While on a wheat-free trial diet for a month, I needed wheat pasta substitutes, and one kind of pasta I tried was this one from De Boles.<br /><br />This is my favorite shape of pasta.  This variety cooks up pretty fast, 5-7 minutes and it's great.  Because of the starch in the rice, it will boil over fast if you don't watch it!  You also need to rinse it with cold water after draining.  When this is done, it does not stick or clump up together.  It also doesn't turn hard or gummy.<br /><br />It does taste different than standard wheat pasta.  It has a brown rice flavor, and while it's not my favorite flavor in the world, it's tolerable.  I don't plan to buy this now that I'm back on wheat, but if you cannot have wheat or gluten, then it's a decent pasta.<br /><br />We had this brown rice pasta for mac -n cheese and for tuna noodle casserole.  In both you could taste the noodles' brown rice flavor, but the other flavors overpowered enough to compensate and the pasta didn't ruin the meal.<br /><br />Kids may find it disgusting, depending on how picky they are.<br /><br />I did not try this pasta with cold pasta salad, but it may not be half bad.

Shipping is always fast, and although the price is rather high - it is not as costly in the long run, as my cats eat the entire can, without waste.  I have found with many other foods, they do not finish the product and I end up throwing half of it away.  I have tried 2 of the flavors and they liked them both.

review/summary: The BEST chocolate cherries...
review/text: Asbach Uralt cherries are the best chocolate cherries I have ever tasted.  The nice quality dark chocolate shell is filled with a single  lightly candied cherry, macerated in Asbach Uralt brandy.  The combination of the rich, slightly bitter chocolate, with the fruity, sweet cherry, and the "bite" of the brandy is divine.  No part of this is sickly sweet.  It's definitely a treat for adult mouths only. I prefer this brand to the Boehme brand of cherries as the Asbach Uralt are slightly less sweet.

review/summary: an unusual snack or dessert idea
review/text: I like Taste of Crete cookies. There are three kinds: orange, grape, and regular. All three are made with olive oil, so I suppose they are more healthful than most cookies. They do not taste like olives any more than ordinary cookies taste like corn or soybeans. Olive oil is simply the fat they were made with and is better than most.<br /><br />They are small like vanilla wafers but kind of hard, like pfeffernuesse. You wouldn't just put them in a disk of ice cream: you can't break them with a spoon. If someone stabs them, they might shoot out of the dish. But they are chewy and fun and might be served as finger food with tea, coffee, or cheese.<br /><br />The plain variety have a mild nuttiness from sesame. The orange ones have a delicate fragrance, are not orangey or acidic, and are good with tea. The grape ones are my favorite and taste like raisins rather than grapes. The grape syrup has oxidized in baking and makes them brown. Their dark flavor reminds me of ginger snaps.<br /><br />They stay fresh for more than a week after opening the container. I keep a box in my office and nibble a few when I must miss a meal. Three cookies have 130 calories, slightly less than a slice of bread with a pat of butter.

review/text: As a Certified Personal Trainer, I am always looking for products to recommend to my clients.  Of course, I would never recommend anything that I have not tried for myself FIRST.  Free range turkey jerky is an excellent choice for snacking, and Shelton's is by far the BEST TASTING! The flavor is not too spicy, but certainly not bland either.  The jerky's texture is very chewable, not leather-like.  Even my elderly clients can chew it. Being turkey, not beef, it saves you calories and fat.  It is a great source of (antibiotic-free) protein that does not make you feel bloated, so it perfect for snacking.  No need to worry about refrigeration after opening, so you can carry it in your gym bag and have the perfect post-workout protein snack.  I also recommend my clients keep it at work so they can avoid being tempted by the vending machines.  Amazon has it at a GREAT price!!

Of course I couldn't return it because they call it food.  The package picture misrepresents the product.  Very little brown turkey,  I would never buy it at a store.  I will read the negative reviews first from now on, which were the truth, not the over abundance of five star.  I was going to say that I will never order food products again from Amazon but I have bought very good Stevia Chocolate before.
