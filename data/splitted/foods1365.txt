review/summary: Very good coffee...lower caffeine, but probably not no caffeine.
review/text: I typically only like to drink Timothy's and Emeril's coffees.  I like coffee strong, without bitter aftertaste.  For a decaf, this is great coffee.  It's not as bold as Timothy's Midnight Magic or Rainforest Espresso (my 2 favorite caffeinated coffees), but for an afternoon or evening coffee that won't keep you up all night, its great.  Only downside is that I think it has more caffeine than other weak decaf coffees.  I like it, but it does affect sleep.  On a positive, if you have it in the afternoon/evening, it might give a LITTLE bit of a much needed pick-up, without getting you overcaffienated as can happen if you have too much regular coffee!

review/summary: A great cup of coffee that just happens to be decaffeinated
review/text: EMERIL'S JAZZED UP DECAF K-CUPS make for a bold, smooth, delicious-tasting cup of dark-roasted coffee without, as other reviewers have noted, a trace of bitterness.  I drink a fully-caffeinated cup of coffee in the morning which provides all the caffeine I want.  If I want more coffee, I follow the first cup with this decaf, and I can't tell the difference.  It's just another great cup of coffee.  Delicious!<br /><br />If you limit your caffeine intake and enjoy a full-bodied dark roast, don't hesitate to try this one.

review/text: I love coffee, and recently was told that I had to switch to decaf. I also only used the kurig coffee maker. I tried several brands to find my favorite, and this one is right up there. Gives a bold tasting coffee and I do not miss the caffine in it at all. Recommend this to all decaf drinkers.

review/summary: The end of a long search for great decaf
review/text: After buying my Keurig (Signature model with the expanded water reservoir), I tried several different decaf options in search of a decaf with real flavor.<br /><br />To be honest, my favorite doesn't come in Keurig format - Trader Joe's French Roast decaf. So I was searching for something close, since using the do-it-yourself K-cup accessory results in too much cleaning for where my Keurig is located: in my cube at work.<br /><br />So I tried: Donut Hole Decaf - meh<br />  Newman's Own Decaf - much better, but still a lighter roast than I wanted<br />  San Francisco Bay French Roast Decaf - was so bad I got a refund from Amazon (thank you!)<br />  Tully's Decaf - very good, but not quite it<br />  Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf - excellent<br /><br />and finally...<br />  Emeril's Jazzed-Up Decaf - outstanding!!<br /><br />I drink mine black, and want to taste the flavor resulting from the roast. Emeril's has a rich set of flavors typical of a great French Roast, and smells fantastic. Most people that smell it can't believe it's decaf.<br /><br />A simply wonderful product. My hat's off, Emeril!

review/text: I expected a better product because it's Emeril and since its called jazzed up I thought it would be strong. Not the case at all. Its just plain old decaf coffee. Nothing special about it. Its weak and not jazzed up at all. Since Emeril is located in New Orleans, I thought maybe it would include chicory or something from that area that would make it a better coffee but that's not the case.  If you want a dissappointment try it. If you like weak coffee try it. But, otherwise, keep walking.

review/text: This Emeril's Jazzed up Decaf taste very good.  My only reticence is that I'm wondering if it has some caffeine in it.  When I have caffeine, I get a sort of a increased blood pressure buzz.  I had that type of buzz after having this coffee.  My wife had the type of feeling in her stomach that she gets when she has caffeine.  I have no way to test the ingredients to be sure.  But I wonder if this coffee is so "jazzed up" that it has a little caffeine.  It would be interesting to see what other people's experience is.<br /><br />UPDATE: - I've now tried this coffee a dozen times...I think it is safe to say that it has no caffeine.  I haven't had the "buzz" I described above.  But the coffee sure does taste good, so I increased my rating to 5 stars.

It is a great coffee, no after taste and a good rich coffee. My son who drinks only reg. coffee does not know the difference with Emeril's. It's still over priced but it's good. I am not a big coffee drinker, one cup in the morning is about it but I like this one.

review/summary: The worst coffee ever
review/text: I ordered this coffee based upon Emeril's reputation in the food industry and the fact that it's called "Jazzed Up".  I generally buy Starbucks or other premium coffees but Starbucks isn't out in a k-cup yet.  I am still in shock about how bad this Emeril decaf is.  I can't even say it's like poor quality grocery store level - it's seriously revolting.  I tried another one just to make sure I didn't get a 'bad' k-cup, but it was just as horrible.  So now I have 48 of these putrid things left.  Wonder if Amazon will take them back?!

review/summary: not tasty, not strong, not good
review/text: The only real flavor this coffee has is burned. No matter how little creamer I use all it tastes like is hot water if you ran it through an old, used k-cup. I really like donut shop decaf and especailly like green mountain french roast decaf, both have great flavor even when brewed on the largest size setting.

review/summary: Best decaf I've tried yet
review/text: This is certainly the best decaf K cup I have tried yet.  I use it with the 4oz setting on my Keurig platinum  machine.  It is still a little too weak, but is head and shoulders above all the other decaf's I've tried.  I've heard that Coffee People Decaf French Roast is superior, but I've had a hard time finding it in stock anywhere.  So until I do find it, Emeril's Jazzed Up will be my decaf of choice.  I'm about to put in my second order. I'm also thinking that a different K cup machine (eg Cuisinart) might result in a better extraction thereby making a stronger brew???  Any thoughts?  Thanks.

review/text: We have been trying out decafs to find good strong ones. I was so hopeful when I opened the box covered with exclamations of  'BAM!' and 'Oh Yeah, Babe!'. That first cup was a huge watery letdown. I can only say that it is not acidic. I tried it a few more times and now it is the coffee that the kids are allowed to drink. Weak, sad decaf.

review/summary: Jazzed Down
review/text: As a fan of the regular Big Easy Bold coffee cups, I did not hesitate to order the decaf, expecting the same depth and richness.  I was disappointed however when I brewed the first cup to find that it tasted much like Dunkin Donuts. The next time I brewed it using the 6oz water selection, and it was better, though still not as I had expected.  Next time I order I will go back to Green Mountain French Roast decaf, which I still have to brew at 6oz, but has the richness I expect.  46 pods to go..............

review/summary: BAD RAP
review/text: This product does come in a shaker cannister not only the small packets. The latter are useful for when you are on the go or at work. Like the lemon and orange versions this product adds excellent citrus flavor without much acid. This product has a good shelf life and can be used creatively. Not only do I add it to water but consider some of the following. Use it in chicken salad, turkey meatloaf, glazing for pound cake, with some butter and pepper over vegetables as well as add a few packets to you pasta water. Fresh lemons and limes may be expensive during certain times of the year and it can be disappointing when they go to waste. This product will not replace the need for the real thing but would be a useful addition to your pantry.

review/summary: WONDERFUL!!!
review/text: I was trying to find a way to make it easier to get my 8 glasses of water every day and bringing sliced lemons to work was messy.  But I just can not stand the taste of plain water!  I got a sample of this and have been HOOKED ever since!  I like the lemon but it is a bit acidic.  The lime is just right though!  It will flavor up to a 20 ounce botttle of water - perfect to keep at my desk and easy to use.  I just clip open the pack with scissors and it easily pours out.  To be honest the orange is my favorite - but I can't find it anywhere yet.  So lime remains my #1 choice so far!!  I am going to look for it in the shaker to use with my cooking - I can just imagine the lemon on fish!! MMMM!

review/summary: Lovely, Luscious, Lime-True Lime Packets
review/text: These Lime packets provide all the health and taste benefits from fresh limes without the mess or spoilage.  They are super convenient and quite versatile.  You can add them to any kind of beverage and even cook with them.  You know the secret to preventing sliced fruits from oxidizing (turning brown) is to put a little lemon or lime juice on them-this works just as easily, just sprinkle it on!  And it's perfect in sauces and salsa.  I carry several packs in my purse at all times since I prefer the taste of lime over lemon and so often, eating establishments only carry lemon, if even that.  The benefit of limes is actually better for you than lemons, I've heard.  The vitamin C content is comparable but I believe it's touted as having more of other types of vitamins.  Whatever the case, I LOVE this product!  I'll never be without the fresh flavor and wholesome goodness of lime.  Unfortunately, all the places I used to buy it locally have stopped carrying this item.  I was thrilled to find the item in a large quantity for less than I would have paid here locally.  I'm not concerned that I may not use them all up by the expiration date because it's kind of difficult for a dehydrated product that is completely sealed in individual packets to go bad if stored in a cool, dry place.  I may not have a bunch left over but it will still be great just the same.  You can't go wrong with this product.  And it comes in Lime, Lemon, and Orange so you can choose your favorite citrus flavor and have it all year-round!  But of course, I'm quite partial to LIME...

review/text: So the taste is fine. The lime IS unsweetened, okay, fine, and the flavor does come through. No, it doesn't have any real tartness or "fresh lime" quality. But it does add lime flavor. But WHY THEY CAN'T offer this in a jar, resealable bag, etc., instead of tiny packets that have so little solid inside that it's actually hard to empty the contents--that, I don't get. Plus it's a lot of little garbage to throw away that surely isn't necessary.

review/summary: Best grilling spice in the world.
review/text: I love this spice! It is coarse, flavorful and works on every meat. Walmart used to carry it and now it is only available through a vendor on Amazon. It is pricier than it was in the store but it is well worth it. I have tried others with the same like ingredients but they don't have the same boldness. Don't waste your time on others, spend the money and buy it!

review/summary: This is the same as.........
review/text: I called Spice Advice at 800-247-5251 and they told me that this Kansas City Steak, Weber (or Tones) Canadian Steak, and Grill Creations - Grill seasoning are all the same.<br /><br />However, if you are not convinced and want to order this under the Kansas City name, you can get it through diversified distributing (the distributor for Tones, Durkee, etc).<br /><br />I cannot verify that these are all the same.  This is just what I was told.

review/summary: The best flavor of all!
review/text: I love anything that's strawberry flavored and this strawberry laffy taffy is the best tasting taffy!  My nephew and I are both crazy about it.  I'm glad they have only strawberry flavor in a big tub like this...  Usually I only see mixed flavor tubs (I hate the banana flavored ones) so when I saw this one, I ordered one immediately.  I'll definitely place this tub right next to my bed :)

review/text: switched to this product and have not been happy with the results. Product seperates with a white cloud forming on the bottom of the bottle which looks horrible and the taste of this product is not as good as some of the cheaper brands. Color of the product is never the same either and has a tendency to turn dark

review/text: Healthy Choice Vegetable Beef Soup. TRUST ME, This soup is HORRIBLE. Does not taste like any soup I've Ever tasted. No Beef Flavor. Taste more like the metal can. Vegetables are hard. Heating the soup longer won't make the vegetables softer. I'll never buy healthy choice again. Zero Stars.

review/summary: Emily's Love Fortune Cookies
review/text: These were awesome.  I bought them for a bachelorette party.  We ate at an Asian restaurant and I thought it'd be a cute favor for the guests attending. Everyone loved them!  I bought them more for the novelty, but they actually tasted really, really good!  I ended up eating all of the leftovers. :)  The fortunes were awesome as well.  I was afraid they'd be cheesy, but they were perfect.<br /><br />I had to call customer service to verify the shipping because I was afraid I wouldn't receive my package on time.  They were really friendly and answered all of my questions and assured me I would get my package on time.  Totally going to try to find another even to use them again!

review/summary: Good Flavor, Inexpensive, Convenient
review/text: I've been using these at work for over a year. We have a brewed coffee club but some people can't follow simple directions so I switched to the Taster's Choice sticks.  I love them - they are inexpensive and the taste is good.  Since I'm adding the water and the coffee is premeasured I get consistent cups of good flavor which is what I wasn't getting from the coffee club.  And they are super convenient.<br /><br />Unlike another reviewer I have had no problem with dissolving in hot water.  Comparing to coffee that is much more expensive seems kind of silly to me.  These are instant coffee crystals, the kind you would get by buying a jar of Taster's Choice.  Before joining our horrible coffee club I used to buy twice a day at a local coffee shop, spending in one day what I now spend in a month.

review/summary: Convenient, But Not Great
review/text: I take these to work for my mid-morning/early afternoon coffee.  We have a regular office coffee pot, but there is only one pot made first thing in the morning, since no one else besides me drinks coffee later than that.  So I started bringing these to work so I could indulge myself, and the convenience is great.  The flavor is decent, too.  The one aggravation is that this stuff doesn't dissolve well.  (Nescafe dissolves great, but I can't seem to find that anymore.)  Oh, and I should mention that sometimes the packets are hard to open.  There are perforations to open them, but sometimes they don't work.  All in all, this is a good product for my particular use, but there is room for improvement.

review/summary: It's... um... Caffeine?
review/text: Bought a pack from Target a month ago and didn't like it that much. If you're not expecting VIA qualiy, or even cheap coffee quality, then you'll be alright. It kind of tastes dirty, and a little burnt. But, it has caffeine and if diluted with water will provide a somewhat pleasent taste. Well, an acceptable taste. I ended up trading up to Douwe Egberts instant coffee for my instant fix. You're mileage may vary though, some think it's the bee's knees.
