review/summary: Not so tasty to me
review/text: I love coconut water.  It's so refreshing.  I've been wanting to try some of the flavored coconut waters and grabbed this when it was on sale.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that I didn't like this flavor at all.  It had a sour taste to me that I really disliked.  I drank down one, but was not happy to think of drinking the other 11!  sigh... I gave the rest of them to my brother and I hope he enjoyed the flavor more than I did.  I wont be getting this flavor again.

review/summary: surprisingly good
review/text: I ordered both the coconut water and coconut water with passion fruit.  I honestly was expecting to like the plain coconut water better because I'm used to having fresh coconut water, but the coconut water with passion fruit was good.  There's a real passion fruit taste present in the drink and it brightens up the drink without being too overwhelming.  It's definitely a great drink to have to start or end the day.

review/summary: Better than O.N.E. Coconut Water with Passion Fruit
review/text: Coconut water is high in potassium and a natural electrolyte.  It helps to rehydrate you much faster than Gatorade only wishes it could.  Depending on what you are used to drinking, you may love or hate coconut water.  I think that it's a matter of getting used to a different taste more than it being "bad" or "gross."  If you go into it thinking you're going to be drinking juice, think again.  This is more a watered down juice-like drink, but it has much less sugar and doesn't give a sugar shock that leaves you wishing for more to drink.<br /><br />My whole family enjoys this brand and this specific flavor combo.  We all do not enjoy plain ole coconut water and really liked the juice-like taste of this flavor.  It works for us, but your family may enjoy another flavor better.  I would try several flavors before deciding on one or none at all.  I had this as a Subscribe & Save item for over a year, until Amazon told me I no longer could buy it that way.  I was devastated.<br /><br />I searched on Amazon to see if I could find something comparable.  After ordering the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JWZVJW">O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Passion Fruit, 8.5-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12)</a> a month ago, I, as well as another family member, finally decided to try one today.  We both had the same reaction..."this doesn't taste as good as the brand we had been drinking."  Hence my coming to Amazon tonight to write a review of the O.N.E. product...  Now I wish I hadn't ordered 3 whole boxes of it!  I thought @ $10/box of 12 I couldn't go wrong.  Hmm, maybe I was wrong!<br /><br />But enough of O.N.E. Coconut Water with Passion Fruit, Vita Coco Coconut Water with Passion Fruit tastes so much better!  If you're sick and feeling dehydrated, this is what you need.  If you've just done a big workout and nothing can quench your thirst, this is what you need.  If you're feeling a little run done or have a headache that just won't quit, this is what you need.<br /><br />Luckily, my dislike of O.N.E. brand led me back to Amazon to see that I could once again order Vita Coco Coconut Water with Passion Fruit as a Subscribe & Save.  Comparably, the price difference is negligible: ounce for ounce it is just about the same.  I only wish I hadn't been ousted before!

review/text: This is a very flavorful beef stock. It is USDA certified organic, which is nice. It can be a little more expensive than other beef broths in the same format. I have found that it is much lower in sodium than those others though, at least the ones carried at my local grocery stores.<br /><br />If you are concerned about MSG sensitivity, you should be aware of all of the possible names on labeling, and read labeling very carefully. The wikipedia page has a list of allowed USDA names for MSG. Since my family isn't MSG sensitive this isn't a concern for us.<br /><br />I recommend this broth, assuming you are not sensitive to MSG.

review/summary: Mmmadagascar!
review/text: Alright I am finally sitting down and doing this review. It's only been about a week since I received my Red Leaf Tea order, but I've had this tea three separate occasions since then. Every time I went to sit down and write a review - I was already finished my cup and I didn't quite know what to say.<br /><br />I think I understand what took me so long. This is a seriously mysterious matcha. When I opened the package and took a whiff, I associated the sweet vanilla smell with something else, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I whisked up a cup between 175-185 degrees - the matcha itself was bright, vegetal, creeeamy and full of vanilla deliciousness. Definite vanilla bean or real vanilla extract - a flavour that isn't sweet but is associated with baking. When I bake with my 3 tablespoons+ of real vanilla - it always smells sooo delicious and sweet, but if you were to taste it itself - it doesn't taste how it smells. That's the opposite of this matcha - it really does taste how it smells - I think that's where the mystery came from.<br /><br />Finally I associated the smell with the matcha whipped shortbread I made a while back. Of course! It smells and tastes like delicious flour, sugar, matcha and vanilla! Since I ate over a dozen of those cookies, it's now obvious where that taste association comes from haha. Love it.  I really want to do a comparison of this vs the new French Vanilla matcha. Subtle but delicious differences I'm sure!<br /><br />Oh man I just got an awesome idea. Mini matcha shortbreads for summer, using the different flavours of matcha! Ah! I can't wait to see how the flavour translates into a simple flour, butter, sugar cookie. Paired with an iced matcha. On the front porch. Okay I don't have a front porch : ( But I have the makings of the rest of it :D<br /><br />I don't know if I mentioned this in my other reviews - but this matcha (and the others) has an amazing echo of taste. The aftertaste of the natural flavours lingers long after I'm finished the cup. To be honest, it kind of makes me crave more. If I wasn't already bouncing off the walls with matcha energy, I might make more! No joke. This stuff packs a serious energy punch. I've been having it every morning! I feel lucky :)

review/summary: Great beginner matcha
review/text: I certainly would not classify this as a "blah" tea, but when I want something flavoured it isn't what I'll reach for - the vanilla flavour is there, but I had hoped for stronger. I made some before work today, and as it cooled (I find it gets better as it cools) I just kept thinking that it tasted like extra smooth regular matcha. Like a toned-down on the grassiness matcha, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think this would be perfect for someone who has been newly introduced to matcha, or for someone who maybe had a bad first experience. If I had tried this as my first matcha, I think I would have thought "Ooh....matcha is awesome!". What I really thought was: "This is interesting....but I think I need to try more before I decide."<br /><br />The Madagascar Vanilla is definitely something that I can see being great in baking or smoothies, and I have read about a few people mixing it with other flavours such as mint (that may be something I need to try in the future!). I can also see it being a go-to tea to make when I'm not sure exactly what I want. I do wonder though how different the French Vanilla matcha is from the Madagascar Vanilla. I may have to place another order soon to compare...<br /><br />The best thing about this matcha is that it seems to be pretty versatile...I feel like I could probably use it to extend the life of some other kinds if I really wanted to. The taste is mellow and smooth, and there is no artificial taste to the vanilla flavoring. I recently noticed that on the Red Leaf Tea website they have an option for a "2 in 1 custom matcha", and I think this would be a really awesome option to use as one of the flavors. I'm not sure I will pick up more of this when it is gone, but that is more due to the fact that there are so many different kinds that I want to try. I could see me coming back to this sometime in the future.

This particular vanilla is not as strong as some - such as french vanilla but if you want your flavors to taste as natural as the flavor additives Red Leaf Tea uses then this is your vanilla!

review/summary: Tasty Healthy Yummy Treat!
review/text: For the past two days every time I walk past my tin of Red Leaf Tea's Madagascar Vanilla Matcha, I have to stop and smell it. It really is an indescribable wonderful smell!<br />I have had this Matcha in Red Leaf's "2 in 1" option combined with Caramel Matcha and it was heaven. This time around I bought each of those flavors separately so I could use them individually or combined. This past weekend, my awesome daughter bought me a Magic Bullet blender because I have been so into making tea based drinks and smoothies etc. Already I have used this amazing flavored Madagascar Vanilla Matcha to make some super scrumptious smoothies. This morning I added it to a peach greek yogurt smoothie and it was delicious. Vanilla goes so well with so many fruits such as strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. Or this Matcha is spectacular all by itself, hot or cold. This flavor Matcha remains my top favorite and I believe I will be reordering this probably every order I place with Red Leaf because you just can't go wrong with this one. (Perhaps I should give Red Leaf's French Vanilla Matcha a chance though!)<br />Besides tasting so yummy, one cup of Matcha tea is equivalent to ten cups of green tea, so the health rewards are astronomical!

review/summary: Vanilla is the one for me.
review/text: So now that I've caved into a growing adoration of matcha, I gave myself permission to cave to the siren's call of Red Leaf Teas. My wife already adores them for their Earls, and Tea Equals Bliss on Steepster has nothing but good things to say about their matchas, so it was an easy next step to take. And the Madagascar Vanilla Matcha was an absolute must for me.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the matcha. I'm in love, y'all. My wife asked how it was, and I could only put the mug down long enough to say "Oh my gawd...." Geez, I'm starting to sound like a Paula Dean special. There was no butter added to this tea, y'all, I promise. You all know how much I love vanilla, it's my chocolate, to be perfectly honest. Especially French Vanilla....mmm. Anyway, this has a creaminess that reminds me of a good French Vanilla, but without being overwhelmingly sweet like some French Vanilla teas can be. The greenness of the matcha isn't lost in the flavoring, it's a very nice balance. It doesn't taste artificial, it just tastes delicious and creamy and smooth and everything I ever wanted in a vanilla matcha. This is definitely one I plan to stock up on, once I've tried all of the ones I want to try! Next on my to buy list is cinnamon, and I'm already dreaming about mixing the cinnamon with the vanilla and drifting off into a delicious, delicious sunset! While full of excess energy, of course! Oooh, and mint for homemade, dairy-free Shamrock shakes! Mmmm....I see a lot of possibilities with this little beauty. Anywhere you need touch of creaminess, this matcha is there! Oh man, remember the blueberry pie I made with Vanilla Oolong? It would be out of this world with this matcha. And make it healthy! Well...healthy-ish.<br /><br />This matcha inspires me to bake and blend my own flavors and just go crazy with matcha. I used to only drink matcha occasionally, but I think this particular tea might lead me down the road of "My Morning Matcha". There are too many possiblities! Blueberries and Cream matcha, Shamrock Shakes, Dreamscicle matcha...do you see where I'm going with this? And the baking ideas are just as endless. Matcha butter cookies....oh hey, y'all! Lookie there, there is butter in this review. Dang.  I guess I am Paula Dean. I promise I will never deep fry matcha.

review/summary: A Great Decaf Blend
review/text: As a decaf coffee drinker, almost exclusively, I have sampled a number of different K-cup decafs.  There is a surprising range in quality of these coffees. The Caribou version is extremely good to me and deserves five stars.  It yields a fairly strong coffee even when made in the largest size.  Decafs seems to be more expensive than regular coffees in general and this is true for the Caribou brand. However, it sure isn't the most expensive and is consistently of good quality. Getting the 24 count package provides a nice supply.  I do usually have maybe 3 or 4 brands available, but go to the Caribou most frequently.

review/summary: One of my favorite decaff brands
review/text: Doctor's orders: Cut down on regular coffee with caffeine. Challenge: Find a decaff that is satisfying. Answer: Caribou decaff! I really enjoyed the regular version of Caribou (with caffeine). So, I thought, maybe take a shot at the decaff version?<br /><br />I have tried a number of decaff K-cup coffees. Some have been okay whereas others were pretty weak and didn't have a smooth taste. Caribou has a good coffee taste and is very satisfying. Overall, this represents one of my favorite decaffs for my Keurig coffee makers. Thus, Caribou is satisfying in both the regular and decaff versions.

review/text: This coffee has a good, well rounded flavor but it was very weak.  I need to compensate by making a smaller cup than when using Tully's decaf french roast.  Disappointing as I usually like Caribou's regular ground decaf coffees.

review/text: Finally a good decaf.  I have tried several decaf coffees that were "OK" at best.  I had just purchased the Caribou (Regular) blend and was ready for disapointment when trying the decaf version.  I was extremley pleased to find it was very similar.  What a great concept, a good decaf coffee that isn't bitter or watered down.

review/text: We drink coffee regularly and searched for a Keurig decaf that we could comfortably drink ourselves and be happy to serve to others.  We like a good, hearty, cup of coffee, and we drink the Caribou Blend in caffeinated coffee; Caribou Blend satisfies both my wife and me.  I like a strong coffee, and she likes the coffee more mild; this is an excellent compromise; the decaf tasted the same as the regular, so we are happy.

review/text: I have been using a keurig brewer for just over a year now and tried just about ever brand of k-cup/coffee that is out there and never had a problem with cups opening up....until I bought a box of Caribou Coffee decaf from Amazon.  I am about half way through my box of 24 and THREE cups have split at the top seal when brewed. I have never had this happen with any of my k cups and now 3 from one box.<br />Hopefully it was just a bad box but still felt like voicing<br /> my opinion

Caribou decaf blend is simply the best decaf I have ever tasted. For me to be satisfied, it needs to taste like regular coffee. Caribou decaf does. And for that reason, it has earned a permanent place on my pantry shelf, next to Black Tiger, Jet Fuel and Rev, my favorite regular K-Cup varieties .

review/text: Of all the K-Cups I've sampled (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033HGLTG">Donut House Collection Donut House Decaf, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I0N2">Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf Coffee, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047726E0">Green Mountain Coffee Decaf Breakfast Blend,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> just to name a few), Caribou Coffee's Decaf is by far my favorite.<br /><br />Bright, bold but not bitter flavor and light texture are hallmark characteristics of Caribou Coffee and this decaf K-Cup doesn't disappoint.  I'll be so bold as to say that it's as good as "being there" in a Caribou Coffee shop.  If you're a fan of a more Starbucks-y dark roast, this may not appeal to you.  While the Caribou Coffee's K-Cup flavor is not nearly as wimpy as Green Mountain or Donut House, it lacks that nearly burnt flavor that often pervades Starbucks' darker roasts.  If I had to guess, I would say that the primary bean in this blend is Kenya.  If you like Kenyan coffee, this is going to be a winner for you.

review/text: After purchasing a decaf k-cup variety pack, I was really disappointed in all of them.  The after tastes were horrible and I never enjoyed a single cup... neither did my husband.  We've never drank decaf before, but were making the switch as we no longer want caffeine in our diets.  Our friend mentioned that it was probably the chemical process used for decaf coffee's that was making everything taste bad and suggested Caribou decaf as it's processed chemical free.  I was literally jumping up and down after my first cup of this, it was delicious!

It does not taste good by itself and has a bit of a bitter taste, but it tastes great with a bit of Sweet n' Low or as iced tea. You can make several cups of tea from one tea-bag, so you can make yourself at least a couple of nice mugs of tea and use just one bag a day, though the second or third cups will require longer to steep. Overall a good tea with great antioxidants and cleansing properties.

Only problem I have with the packaging is that it has the recipe for a farro salad but not instructions on how to cook it plain.  Use the 2-1 recipe like rice - 2 cups water to 1 cup farro.

review/summary: Farro is the new Broccoli!
review/text: This easy to cook farro grain is chewy and delicious - tastes more like pasta than a grain.  Some farro requires pre-soaking and a long cooking time.  This Roland Farro Semipearled from Italy is easy to cook. I love to cook it (much like one would cook rice) and when its cool, mix it with chopped cucumber, chopped tomatoes, chopped red onions, a tiny bit of olive oil and some balsamic vinegar.  Had a farro salad side dish at a popular chain Italian restaurant and just had to try it at home.  I found that farro is difficult to find (seems it's only available at local Italian specialty stores right now) but Amazon offered it at a lower price than anyone else online so that was my choice.  Some sites interchange farro with barley - they are NOT the same.  I don't like cooked grains (barley, etc.) but farro is special.  This grain is delicious and super good for you, too.

review/summary: Ancient Grain Wins High Scores
review/text: I'd been reading about farro and spelt for some time - couldn't locate it around my area.  I'm an adventurous cook and, based on recipes I've seen, decided I would try it.  Wow! It's really delicious and easy to prepare.  It makes a wonderful risotto.  The farro has a wonderful, nutty flavor and robust texture.  This product is semi-pearled which makes it easier to prepare - faster cooking.  I've almost used up the first bag.  I'm planning on using it for a whole grain salad recipe I've found.<br /><br />I'm so pleased that Amazon's marketplace offers the opportunity to purchase products otherwise unavailable outside large urban areas.  Thanks!

review/text: As a happy consumer of Earth Grains Faro, I was disappointed to find Amazon out of stock--and ordered the Roland brand instead.  Where the Earth Grains brand is tender, with separate grains, good texture and a mild, wheaty flavour-the Roland brand is tough, gritty and altogether unpleasant.

review/summary: Roland Farro Semipearled
review/text: I only discovered this grain about two years ago and that is odd since I like Italian food, travel in Italy, have Italian friends, etc., etc.  This grain is not readily available in my local markets, including two health food stores I checked.  Farro makes a delicious salad and is a good hot side instead of using rice or pasta.  I recently served it with Marinara sauce and meatballs.  It can also be used for a risotto-like dish. I also used it in a chicken/vegetable soup instead of pasta.  Highly recommended!

review/text: I have taken to stocking gum at my desk, but that can get expensive when you use the products at "normal" stores.<br /><br />This tub lasts my office co-workers a long time and the gum is big enough where one piece usually suffices.  Just like all gums in this genre, the flavor fades relatively quickly, but this is the most economical way to purchase them.<br /><br />One last note, the product comes sealed around the rim of the bucket, but it also comes sealed across the opening on the inside - I liked that because it meant that the gum is fresh and not rock hard!

review/text: The gum is not a solid "barrel" shape although the packaging makes it appear to be the same.  There are ridges in the gum and thus it does not make a full piece of gum.  I contacted Dubble Bubble thinking they changed the product and I was told that "the retailer requested" the gum to be like that--Dubble Bubble did not change their product otherwise.  The flavors are still the same and good.

review/summary: This is not the Fleer Dubble Bubble of old
review/text: I bought this tub expecting the nostalgic Dubble Bubble smell and taste I loved as a kid. That gum was packed in the old Fleer Baseball Card wax-packs. Concord Confections bought the rights to the name from Fleer. (Subsequently Tootsie Roll bought Concord.) Anyway, The flavor formula was changed by Concord. It's now just generic bubblegum. Not only that, the size of the gum has been reduced. With clever packaging, it looks about the same size wrapped, but the gum is no longer a solid "barrel" shape. It is now a smaller barrel with gear-like teeth around it which holds the packaging out so it seems like a more substantial piece than it is. The logo is misleading too. It says, "America's Original". The name is the same but the product is very different. Looks like we have lost a sweet bit of Americana.

review/text: What ever happened to the bubble gum of old? If you expect to find it here, you will be disappointed.<br />Bubble gum used to be a penny a piece. The penny piece was also a decent sized piece.<br />Now, the price has jumped and the size did shrink. This is not the same Dubble Bubble gum any more.<br />The flavor is nice, for a few seconds. Then, nothing. The pieces are also too small to blow bubbles. You need to chew two to three pieces to get a decent bubble.<br />Maybe I should look for Bazooka Joe? (Or is he too, just a distant memory?)

review/summary: Great gluten-free hot cereal
review/text: I first tried this cereal when Whole Foods carried it for a few months. Then they stopped carrying it, so now I order 6 boxes at a time from Amazon. It's delicious stuff. I always loved oatmeal, but when I had to cut out gluten, it seemed impossible to find an instant cereal as good as Quaker Oats. This Eco Planet cereal is not artificially sweet, which might take people some getting used to, but it's very tasty.<br /><br />I did try microwaving it, but, after several messy explosions due to winging the amount of water instead of measuring properly, I went back to making it the old-fashioned way by boiling water in a kettle.

review/summary: Veterinarian review
review/text: Zuke's produces some great products. Recently, I tried the "Natural Purrz" healthy moist cat treats (Savory Salmon flavored). The nice things about these treats is that they are low-calorie (only 2 calories per little moist treat). Also, Zuke's products are made with high quality protein and grains, and all ingredients come from the US (Made in the USA!). That said, these small treats remind me of my cat's monthly Heartgard medication - it's only palatable to some cats. Seamus, my fatty tabby, likes these, but not as much as the Greenie crunchy treats. Echo, my svelt black cat, won't touch these moist treats. Overall, they are a great option for a low-calorie treat, but use in moderation. It also comes in a "tender chicken" flavor.<br /><br />The active ingredients in Natural Purrz (Savory Salmon) include: salmon, barley flour, rice flour, vegetable glycerin, malted barley, tapioca, gelatin, water, menhaden fish oil, brewer's yeast, natural flavors, lecithin, cultured whey, acetic acid, salt. Vitamins and Minerals: Vitamins A, D3, E, B12, taurine, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) calcium pantothenate, riboflavin (B2) niacin, thiamine mononitrate (B1), pyridoxine hydrochloride (B6), folic acid, zinc oxide, sodium selenite (source of selenium).<br /><br />So, overall, one paw down for overall palability... That said, they don't go to waste - while the protein content is likely too high for my dog, JP loves these as small additions to his Kong toy...

He will follow you anywhere and comes running if he even hears the bag being jostled. I like that they are natural, but would prefer if they were completely grain free. They are small enough to be eaten quickly, but just soft enough that they are easy to break apart for training. Definitely a favorite in our house now!

review/text: My cat has food allergies - he can't have chicken, turkey, corn, or soy, among other things. So finding cat treats he can have has been a challenge, especially when he decided he didn't like the simple dried fish or freeze-dried beef lung type of treats. However, he goes completely wild for these! Since they use rice flour & tapioca as the binder, they don't trigger his allergies. YMMV, cats are very individual in their tastes, but if you have a cat with food allergies, you may want to give these a try.
