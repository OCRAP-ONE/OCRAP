review/summary: Great alternative quick cooking "starch" for dinner
review/text: If you are looking for a healthy alternative for potatoes or noodles or white rice, Hodgson's whole wheat couscous is it. After you boil the water it takes 5 minutes of standing and that's it. You can add ingredients to "spice" it up. I wasn't able to find it in my local stores so I am very happy to find it on Amazon..<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDDEV4">Hodgson Mill Whole Wheat Couscous, 11-Ounce Units (Pack of 8)</a>

review/summary: Non tummy irritating iron for iron deficiency anemia
review/text: I happened upon Total cereal when doing research on how to deal with a post-operative iron deficiency anemia. I was surprised to learn that there aren't many foods that really have lots of iron. Clams, beef liver, and, ta-da, Total cereal are amongst the highest. The first two (called heme iron) are absorbed much better than the Total cereal (non-heme), but let's face it, how much beef liver and clams can you eat? I happen to like the taste (note like, not love), and I eat it every morning and look forward to breakfast. I'm realistic -- it's a whole grain cereal without any fancy flavor additions so it's really likely to be sorta on the dull side. On the other hands, it's a whole lot better than having an upset tummy from iron supplements. I appreciate this price in comparison to the really high price at our local grocery stores.

I can deal with this.<br /><br />Then I added milk. Now they taste bad. :( It's not the milk either. I had some without the cereal and it tastes fine. I looked at all the goodness on the side of the box and just know that this is a healthier choice but I'm never going to eat these with milk again.

review/summary: Absolutely Awful Cat Food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs." Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

review/summary: colorful and pure
review/text: This is bright, fresh-tasting,and colorful unlike some sludgy, gritty, dull-colored pistachio butters. Perhaps it is the small amount (and imperceptible tasting) of olive oil. The texture is creamy but with a little nuttiness to it ie this isn't creamy like Skippy peanut butter. If you want to make gelato, however, you should use a sweetened Sicilian pistachio butter. This one is a lovely alternative to almond butter or any other nut butter--and so pretty.

review/summary: An Awesome Alternative To Peanut Butter!
review/text: While preparing for a photography trip, I decided I wanted to pack up some food items with me rather than do too much grocery shopping once I arrive at my destination.  I wanted an alternative to peanut butter and decided to try this product.  It's AWESOME!  The ingredients do NOT include sugar; I've tried other nut butters before and have been disappointed in that they always are too sweet, sometimes listing sugar as the second ingredient!  This product, is so yummy that the majority of the time, I was just eating it with a spoon right out of the jar.  It's a little more "liquid-y"; definitely not as stiff as peanut butter.  You can see the tiny chunks of pistachios in the mixture.  It's kind of pricey, so probably not something you would get on a regular basis (although I am so taken with this brand that I recently ordered another jar of this raw pistachio butter from the same seller).  If you want something that tastes like the nuts from which it is made, without any other additives except oil and a little bit of salt, then this particular brand of raw pistachio butter is exactly what you need to try.

Currently, impossible to locate this flavor on the shelves. New Maxwell House flavors have surfaced of late, and I suspect seasonal flavors are ruling due to lack of sufficient shelf space to include my favorite.  If you can find it on the shelf, it'll probably be cheaper, though.  Usually retails between $3-$4 apiece.

I enjoy eating risotto with these crackers to add a touch of salt and crunch to the rice dish.

I'd only eat one again if there was absolutely nothing else in the house.<br /><br />I tried Nature's Path Organic Frosted Strawberry Toaster Pasteries simply because "he" threw it into the shopping cart, insisting it had to be good. Oh, well... whatever.

To my absolute astonishment, it was not just good, but VERY, VERY GOOD!<br /><br />This product tasted to me like something from a bakery. The crust was flaky, soft yet a bit crispy. There is absolutely no chemical after-taste. And, there is fruit inside. Yes, I was astonished. It was not like a slab of stale jello, but real, tasty strawberry with a nice, natural taste. Furthermore, it was not overly sweet.<br /><br />Not only was I amazed, I will purchase this product over and over again.<br />Once you try it, you will as well!<br /><br />Very highly recommended.

In a matter of days, you may find yourself conditioned to drool at the mere sound of the toaster lever clicking into place...Pavlov would be proud.)<br /><br />The only downside (and I hope Nature's Path pays attention to this) is that the pastries are packaged in PAIRS--making it altogether too tempting to eat both. Better if the box just had ONE re-sealable pack inside; that way, you could simply open it, take the one you want, and close the package back up. With the current packaging, re-sealing isn't a viable option, and so you're kind of "forced" to eat both pastries. (I mean, you wouldn't want to let one go stale...what a waste!)

review/summary: Delicious snack for kids and parents alike!
review/text: When my husband became the stay-at-home parent, he also started grocery shopping more for our family.  Problem is, he is not a label-checker and too often buys things high in sugar, HFCS and preservatives.  My kids became accustomed to eating sugary cereals, toaster pastries and iced candy disguised as breakfast.  When I saw these in our local coop, I thought they'd make an excellent alternative.  I just tried my first one, thinking I would just have a bite and then pass off to one of my kids. Well, I ate the whole thing. Quickly. These are perfectly sweet; not too much, not too little.  Much more palatable than the other, more mainstream brand.  The filling tastes like real fruit! Imagine that.  I have successfully moved my kids to healthy cereals and whole wheat toast, but these offer a nice "treat" for those days when we're in a rush or they are begging for a "toaster pastry." I also plan to bring some to work to keep in my desk for that midday snack.  Highly recommend! My only complaint is that they come 2 per wrapper.  Not sure how to keep the second one fresh? Other than that, I am a happy customer.

review/summary: Yay! Kosher toaster pastries!
review/text: I was so excited to see these toaster pastries at the store. I don't eat pork or pork-products, which includes gelatin. Since most leading brand toaster pastries have gelatin in them, I've gone a long time without them, and I missed them dearly. Suddenly, I spot these beauties, and I must say, they're even better than I remember toaster pastries being. The rest of my "non-kosher" family also had some, and it's all we buy. The crust tastes like pie-crust, and I'm absolutely in love.

review/summary: Tastey, but very sugary. Not for those trying to lose weight type of snacks.
review/text: It doesn't taste like it has loads of sugar. Then I checked the label and EACH pastry has 19 grams of sugar. If you sit there and eat the whole bag, it's 38 grams of sugar and 410 calories combined. That's meal worthy, not a snack. It tastes very good. I didn't buy this at amazon, but at my university because I needed a snack and saw this was organic and it was very cheap. It costs 99cents plus tax for 2 pastries. I was shocked since the university jacks up the price of everything.<br /><br />I wouldn't consider buying these if you want to lose weight and get a snack in the mean time. Just too much sugar for something organic.<br /><br />Though in a way it isn't meant to be a health food, it's just made out of organic things. But if you are trying to lose weight and want a healthy snack, this isn't it.<br /><br />These tastes more fruitful than poptarts.

review/summary: Higher in sugars than Poptarts, NOT whole grain
review/text: Well, let me start by saying that I DO like unfrosted strawberry PopTarts. These Toaster Pastries are almost as good, as PopTarts, and as far as the organic label, better for you if you like to support organic farming, have chemical allergies, etc.  PopTarts DO have real fruit, unlike a previous review implies.  However, Kellogg's uses DRIED fruit, which I think gives a FRUITIER, slightly more tart flavor.  I have a hard time finding the fruity flavor, fruity enough in the Nature's Path.  They need to try drying their fruit, too, to concentrate the flavor. I think that most people who are health/nutrition conscious would also be disappointed to find that Nature's Path frosted AND unfrosted (blueberry is the flavor that I have, since the unfrosted strawberry is 10 bucks more than the frosted ones on Amazon...go figure) has a higher sugar content, and zero whole grain, although the overall fiber is 1 gram per serving instead of "less than one gram" on the PopTarts.  I will also state, that as of yet, I have never received anything stale from Amazon.  I do prefer all of my Tarts toasted.

review/text: These are great, they taste like real fruit, have a nice crust, and not-too-sweet icing. They are a treat around here since, although they are organic, they are still mostly white flour and sugar. They are way, way better than pop-tarts but more expensive and difficult to find. I had no problem with the freshness from amazon, they were nice and fresh with an expiration date months and months away. I just wish they were individually wrapped because it's so hard not to eat both at once!

review/summary: A fast, sweet treat (with a tiny bit less guilt)
review/text: I subscribed to these in the 6-count boxes (12 to a carton), rather than the 12-count boxes (6 to a carton, which cost $3 less at Amazon than the smaller boxes),  but whichever packaging you buy them in, I'd recommend these organic frosted strawberry toaster pastries . . . IF you want something in your pantry that you can grab and eat (either hot or cold -- when I'm running REALLY late, I can just grab a packet of these to eat at my desk, no toaster required) for a slightly less guilt-inspiring sugary breakfast or snack.<br /><br />I never cared much for the brand-name OR generic 'pop-tarts', but these organic toaster pastries seem to have more flavor and substance than the pop-tarts I used to despise (they're not just ALL refined sugars and bleached flour).  The cherry-pomegranate are also good, though a little sweeter (sometimes a little TOO sweet for my taste, depending on my mood).  These strawberry pastries with the plain, light frosting usually hit the spot just right, for a treat or a hasty way to break my fast.

review/text: This is a new hobby for me and it has been fun roasting my own coffee beans with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BLIDD8">Toastess TCP-388 Hot-Air Popcorn Maker</a>. I have tried just a few deferent types but so far I think this is one of my favorite so far. I have been experimenting with roasting times leaning toward dark French roast 13.5min/sec @ 497� (espresso). I have noticed the heavy oily residue on the bean not seen on others and a more robust aroma and taste. I will buy another bag soon I hope the price goes back down; I think it was a little cheaper a few months ago. Oh the dirty little bean comment, burlap sack fibers and strings were in the bag for that special flavor. Overall for the price and freshness I give it 4 stars.

review/summary: Surprisingly good; easy and inexpensive to roast
review/text: The beans were well packaged and delivered quickly with Amazon Prime--two days.  Despite warnings that a conventional electric oven is a poor way to roast coffee, it was all I had till my popcorn popper arrives.  I used a wire-mesh pizza screen over a ceramic "pizza stone" to roast the beans.<br /><br />I preheated the oven to 500F and let it stabilize for nearly ten minutes, while I spread the beans in a single layer over the pizza screen, taking care to reach beneath the screen and push any beans back up onto the surface of the screen before placing them on the stone.  Any beans slightly poking through the screen will be stuck there and difficult to remove after roasting without pulverizing them (they swell when roasted).<br />Next I placed the screen onto the stone.  The idea was to use the stone to even out the electric oven's heat, and to ensure as uniform a roast as possible.<br />I quickly opened the oven to rotate the mesh screen 15 to 20 degrees at 90 second to two-minute intervals.  (You can easily move the screen without burning your fingers by using a pair of table-wear forks.)  I listened for the first crack, and waited till about midway through the second crack to remove the screen and dump the roasted beans into a mesh colander over the sink, where I agitated them vigorously to remove the chaff and cool the beans.<br />If further cooling is needed the beans can be placed back onto the cooled pizza screen and suspended between two raised objects to allow air to circulate around the beans.<br /><br />I was delighted with the medium roast of the beans!  I made a large Americano with the espresso machine . . . my son commented that his coffee actually tasted sweet in the aftertaste.<br /><br />If oven-roasting turned out this good, I am excited to discover what roasting beans over the stove in the (purchased from Amazon!) popcorn popper may produce.<br /><br />Excellent beans, great flavor and aroma.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Purchased the Great Northern Stainless Steel popper from Amazon . . . and I am very pleased with the roasted beans.  It took some experimentation (and some mistakes) to learn how to get the most uniform roast from the popper.<br />Here's what I learned, in a nutshell:<br />1)  Preheat the popper on the lower end of "Medium" (electric stove) for a couple of minutes.<br />2)  Put in between 1 and 2 cups of beans, and begin turning the lever.  I give it three moderately slow turns (just a little less than one full turn/second, times 3) then 4 turns as fast as I can, then repeat the three moderately slow turns, then 4 fast turns, etc.  I think it may be a little better to take a very brief jag backward on the turn before taking the 4 fast ones--the beans sometimes stick under the agitator blades, and this shakes them loose.<br />Why the three slow then four fast turns?  Because the beans tend to rest on their flat sides, and just slide around on the bottom of the popper, getting dark on the bottom flat side and a bit too light on the rounded side of the beans.  The four fast turns agitates them and makes the beans more uniform.  If you don't believe this, try it both ways.<br />Agitate as above through the first crack, and as the second crack begins, pop one side of the lid open and dump the beans into your colander for cooling/de-chaffing.<br />That's it.<br />I get results quite similar to the commercial roaster we have a few miles away.

review/summary: First Time Roasting
review/text: I bought these beans with the idea that I would start roasting my own beans while searching for the perfect cup of coffee, both in taste and economy. I roasted one pound of beans on the stove with a Whirley-pop popcorn maker, from start of heat to finish this method took about 20 minutes to produce a dark-dark roast. As an amateur, I'm only guessing that it was good enough to be an Italian roast. (Note: This is darker than recommended light-French roast.) Once cooled and ground this brewed a fine cup of coffee. I am not well versed enough yet to completely characterize the roast, but I drink a lot of coffees.<br /><br />A 5 pound bag wasn't as big as I thought it would be, but then I had forgotten about water weight. I weighed pre and post roast and found that my one pound was reduced to 11.5 ounces.<br /><br />The beans in the bag seem fine. I haven't run into any "ugly" beans, or foreign objects, the beans themselves kind of resemble soy nuts in size and color. They have a sort of alfalfa pellet smell, which I kind of like. The only thing I was kind of disappointed with is the product labeling. I was hoping to see more information about the origin and dates harvested and packaged. There was a sticker with the number 22012, which I can only assume is the date the bag was filled.<br /><br />I have found less expensive beans on the internet from other suppliers, but for the convenience of Amazon, and free two day shipping with Prime, it's a pretty good deal. Through the suppliers website you can get the beans for about 7 bucks less, but then I'm sure you will make that up even with slower ground shipping.<br /><br />All in all a good deal for a fun and rewarding activity.<br /><br />(Additional note: I recommend roasting outside or in the garage. My house was filled with smoke, and it scared the dog so much she peed on the floor.)

review/summary: cumin seeds are cumin seeds... but this is a LOT for a great price
review/text: They last forever in seed form (as opposed to pre-ground). This is, however, a GREAT deal! I would probably pay 10 times more for this much cumin at the grocery store. I emptied the 6-pack into a tupperware container for storage, and I grind a spice jar's worth of seeds at a time to use in cooking. If you use a lot of cumin, this quantity for such a low price is a steal!

review/summary: Delicious cereal at a good price
review/text: Life cereal is quite tasty. It's sweet, but not so sickeningly sweet that only a child could like it. I'm an adult and I enjoy eating it regularly.<br /><br />What's better than Life cereal? Life cereal at Amazon prices. The "regular price" for a box of this cereal at local grocery stores is in the neighborhood of $3-4. Outrageous. I commonly see supermarkets offer it for $2.00 in their weekly ads. That's more reasonable.<br /><br />However, Amazon's regular price undercuts even the supermarket sale price if you choose the Subscribe and Save option. Plus, when you do Subscribe and Save you can choose your shipment rate based on your consumption rate, never have to worry about running out, and get free shipping! What's not to love?

review/summary: Best Cereal Ever!
review/text: As a kid all I ate for breakfast was sugary cereal and it was great! However now as an adult I don't like eating those cereals to start off my day. I guess its because I have outgrown them and they don't taste as great anymore. Sure Life cereal has a little kid on the box, but that doesn't mean its for kids! You see I told Life to do that so no other adults would buy up all my Life!  This way I can buy mass quantities of Life and eat it everyday for every meal because its just THAT good.  And Amazon sells bulk 6 packs of Life for like $13 which beats any store price around where I live.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon delivers the cereal fine. I have had no problem with boxes with a lot of crumbs.  But even if I did, heck id still eat it! Best cereal ever.

I also tried a can of the Pro Plan senior/sensitive stomach in salmon flavor and that was actually his favorite.

It is perfect for her as she is 13yrs and 6 months and has lost many of her teeth.  The bits are small and easy for older dogs who have few teeth which makes it hard for her to chew anything that is tough or hard. After giving her her morning treat she sat on her mat and waited for some more - actually begging for more. I will be ordering more of these Fish bits as they fit my pet's requirements.  I thank Dr. Harvey for having these healthy and much loved treats.

review/summary: why so expensive -- and what's with the texture?
review/text: I usually buy wheat berries in bulk but had no other choices yesterday and bought the only brand (Nature's Earthly Choice, packaged) carried in my local market. Not only is Nature's Earthly Choice about FIVE times as expensive as buying in bulk (even from the high-end national chain store), but Nature's Earthly Choice is also more expensive than virtually all other brands. And after cooking, Nature's Earthly Choice Wheat Berries looked awful - as if they'd been totally overcooked and every kernal had exploded. (Perhaps that's because they've been turned into a "cooks in 15 minutes" processed grain.) Cooking instructions on the package are almost non-existant -- no mention of medium or low flame, covered or uncovered, whether all the water was all supposed to be absorbed or what. The salad recipe on the package made it sound like there should've been no excess water, so after 20 minutes on an uncovered simmer I figured I was supposed to drain the berries. I know I'll end up feeling like I should apologize to fans (of my usual apple salad with wheat berries) about how it looks.  Very disappointing and a ripoff.
