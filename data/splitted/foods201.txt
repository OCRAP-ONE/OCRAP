review/summary: usually good chips
review/text: i have eaten these chips for years. they are no longer available where i live so i have had to start getting them online. they are usually good. this particular batch wasnt the best i've had. the chips seem too thick and somewhat stale. so its too bad when you get a bad batch and you bought a box of 12. oh well. hopefully my next batch will be better.<br />however they were shipped immediately and arrived over a week before i was expecting them so that was great.

review/summary: Great Flavor Even fooled meat eaters
review/text: Based on reviews online for vegan snacks, I tried this particular flavor and love them. Great snack for the road. They are mostly Wheat gluten in case you want to limit your soy intake. My friends who eat animals loved them also. I didn't mention what they were made of until they were finished eating them and asked. Nice chewy texture. These travel well. They have 10 Gms of protein in case you are asked "where do you get your protein?" I plan on trying another flvor.

review/summary: Primary Flavor is Sugar
review/text: I don't want to say these are awful but I won't ever get them again. The praise in other reviews, especially for the hickory strips, convinced me to try them. I now suspect the praise was "planted" by vested interests.<br /><br />The weaknesses of the product are legion. First, it's so hard to get the package open I had to get out the scissors; thinking you could get it open while hiking is delusional. You'll have to stop along the trail and get out a tool. I recommend a hatchet.<br /><br />Finally opened, the first realization is that slugs are less slimy. This in no way resembles a jerky if that's what you were hoping for. It's more like a piece of fruit leather that got left in the bathtub over night. Or just a mashed slug.<br /><br />Then there's the taste.  It basically tastes like sugar. Very unhealthy treat for diabetics certainly; you'll need an electron microscope to read the molecular fine print, but basically it provides a heavy load of cane sugar.<br /><br />At best this is like slimy candy, not jerky at all, not even close. For a vegetarian jerky product that is both tasty and relatively healthy and won't leave your fingers covered in pancake syrup, I recommend Stonewall's Jerqee.

review/summary: Warning: These smell and taste like dog food :(
review/text: I am a vegetarian, and I wanted so badly to like this vegan jerky. As soon as I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was that the jerky is very moist, not like real beef jerky at all (which I understand to be dry and chewy). Also, it smelled like pure dog food. I decided to take a bite anyway, and found that it tastes exactly like it smells. All I could think about was that I was eating dog food. I gave it 2/5 stars because one of my friends actually liked it, and apparently so do a lot of Amazon users since it comes highly recommended. Hopefully you like it better than I did, but beware if you are easily put off by unpleasant smells!

review/summary: Packaging Impossible to Open
review/text: These are great tasting tofu jerky strips!  Low in fat, high in protein, and pretty low in calories (99 calories in this flavor) across the board.  This flavor can be a bit spicy, depending on the batch.  My last batch was great, but the current one has some very small, but whole peppercorns throughout the jerky.  It's still good, but I'm on the fence as to which batch I prefer.  The only real complaint I have is that the packaging is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to open without a pair of scissors.  It's not real great for on-the-go when you have to wrestle with the package with both hands and your teeth to get it open.  I can't understand why they made the packaging this way, what a bummer.

And the flavor is beyond description, in a bad way.  I've tried almost all of the flavors now, and would never buy ANY of them again.  They have a weird perfumey taste.  So, they're slimy and taste awful.  That about sums it up.

Considering all the health risks from eating foods made in China, I don't think I can trust the ingredients used in this product.

So what guarantee is there that this product do not contain carcinogens or other harmful chemicals?

review/summary: Not as good as it could be (misleading ingredient label also)
review/text: A number of us earnestly tried this product but after trying another brand, found this to be wanting very much.<br /><br />  With that said, there is a company making soy jerky that has better flavor, texture and quality. They even make jerky that is unsweetened. Most importantly, this company tasty eats does not have any garlic or onion powder in any of their products.<br /><br />  This was the biggest, we felt, downfall of this product. Except this company, every jerky company; except tasty eats which uses no garlic or onion powder in any of their product line, all would list garlic or onion if an ingredient. The primal strips company has "vegetarian spices" so one is not clear what this is. Even the company, after phoning them, are rather reticent about saying if their is granulated garlic or onion. But there is. In these primals strips, all are having some form of garlic, possibly onion.<br /><br />  We found tasty eats soy jerky to be Perfect. Really, in quality, texture and also the fact that they use no onion or garlic whatsoever.

review/text: First, a bunch of us tried this product, but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand. And, we found out it has granulated garlic, possibly onion. It does not say it on the ingredient label like every other jerky company does; even in addition to "spices". Here it is part of the "vegetarian spices" ingredient.<br /><br />  The company does not seem very forthcoming. Anyway, we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger, teriyaki, original, peppered, hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality, texture and flavor. In fact, we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki, original and many other flavors. But, we'll order those when they are available.<br /><br />  Really try it, it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky. We have tried numerous jerkys for vegans and vegetarians; and many do not want garlic or onion powder in them. This tasty eats soy jerky is the best tasting and what more, no onion or garlic powder in any of their product line. They are rated 5 of 5. This primal strip does not compare.

Well, even calling the company, they are not forthcoming, because we could taste garlic in it, and compared to "tasty eats" soy jerky, this does not even compare.<br /><br />  So first, the ingredient "vegetarian spices" includes granulated garlic powder, possibly onion. In ayurvedic terms, this is not Sathwic for one's body.<br /><br />  We totally recommend the soy jerky by tasty eats. We ordered six cases of the ginger. They use no onion or garlic in any of their products. Most companies do list "spices" but they will almost always label garlic or onion powder separately. This company who makes the primal strips does not. After all the comparisons, we found tasty eats soy jerky to be the best taste, quality and texture.<br /><br />  In fact, they are out of Teriyaki, their best selling jerky, the original flavor, peppered and hot n' spicy. But we will order cases of them when they become available.  They provide a first class jerky that is healthy and proper for everyone; esp. vegans and vegetarians.

review/text: I am a card-carrying carnivore.  Having said that, I am also the Laziest Man This Side of a Lebowski.  Even chewing is too much work for me.  Given that, Primal Strips are heaven.  The texture is very close to meat, but is consistently chewable, with none of the gristle often associated with beef jerky.  Spam is too gooey.  Real beef jerky makes my jaw ache, and I end up spitting out gristle too frequently.  But this?  This is perfect.  If "they" replaced meat with this Soylent Brown-type food, I'd happily leave the Real Thing behind.  I'm not sure of the health benefits.  I guess it's good for me.  I've seen people who are healthier than I eating it, so I figure it's nutritious.  Anyway, it tastes robust, has a perfect texture, and is a perfect snack.

review/summary: best vegetarian jerky
review/text: There really aren't any vegetarian jerkies that replace meat jerky.  Some vegetarian jerkies are so horrid, it is surprising they made it to market.<br /><br />Even in their tiny packages, a lot of vegetarian jerkies are so bad I can't finish them.<br /><br />But there are a lot of varieties of this brand that we like:  teriyaki, hickory, and thai peanut are our favorites.  This is seitan, which is a chewy gluten product.  It is stringy in texture, moist, and is a good match for the flavors.  There are some flavors I don't particularly like, such as the lime flavor, but even the ones I don't like seem like someone else would. (As in, I don't like barbecue potato chips, but I can see where someone else would.)

review/text: These jerky strips are delicious!  I've been a vegetarian for 13 years and I'm always looking for tasty vegetarian "meat replacement" foods.  These strips definitely work for me. I keep a couple in my car to snack on when I don't have time to stop and eat.  The texture is so "meat-like" you will question yourself and re-read the ingredients to be sure is isn't made from animal flesh. I bought a case of the Texas BBQ and a case of the Hickory Smoked.  They are both fantastic, and the Texas BBQ has a nice spicy kick! I think you'll really enjoy this product.

review/summary: Tasty but with a big drawback
review/text: Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot.  Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is "imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west."<br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the "wet" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer).

review/summary: Very Convincing Meat Replacement
review/text: I ate beef jerky every single day at my school cafeteria when I was growing up. I loved the stuff. And then I became a vegetarian and, alas, I thought my beef jerky days were done for. Until I discovered this. It is very convincing - the texture isn't gross or suspect like many fake meat products. It isn't too tough, is a bit moist, and has a nice flavor. It is much softer than Tofuky Jerky beef jerky replacement, so the texture is easier to deal with, but this flavor is more sweet than the spicy Tofuky Jerky version. I'm excited to taste other flavors to see if there is something a bit on the spicy barbecue side rather than sweet barbecue side, but in general, I really like this and it might convince even the most skeptical meat eater. My dad even liked it, which is saying a lot - he is an old school eater who was very skeptical of anything vegetarian.

review/text: I am not by any means a vegetarian (I eat my steaks rare), but I do try to eat healthy.  Beef jerky is a great snack if you are on the go (I travel a lot), but the constant intake of red meat is not good for you.  So, I tried the Primal Strip vegan strips.  I have had every one that they make.....and they are all good.  The Thai Satian Peanut is by far my favorite (the hot and spicy shiitake mushroom jerky is my second favorite).  I have recommended this snack to even the most devout meat eaters and they even like it.  I give it 5 stars - but just like everything - they are not for everyone.  I recommend buying them individually first, and if you love it then come back to amazon and get a box (amazon is the cheapest for the boxes).

Even my carnivorous relatives in Wisconsin took to these Strips. My only outstanding concern is that Primal Strips are manufactured in Taiwan, which  means their production is outside the domain of US food safety and inspection. However, having consumed over two dozen of these strips in the past month, I remain happy and healthy.

review/text: I'm torn. I love these strips. They feel like the real thing and they taste great (even my dog loves it...he doesn't care if it's veggie), but they're so moist. They're marinating inside the package, and I understand that it probably needs to stay that way to keep the flavor, but it just doesn't feel like real beef jerky because it isn't dry. I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out, and that worked fine, but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good, and I do like them, but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky.

review/summary: Yummy, even to an carni/omnivore
review/text: I'm an avowed omnivore.  I love me some jerky, too.  Meat in all forms, really.  An exchange with an old girlfriend summed it up quite well... "You know, you don't have to eat meat every day," she said. My response was stunned silence.  The point?  These are darned tasty to a meat-lover like myself.  Not just these, but the entire line (that I've tried so far).<br /><br />No, you're not likely to be fooled into thinking it once had parents.  The texture of seitan is not all that meat-like, despite what the vegans say (what do THEY know about it, anyway?!).  However, it does have a satisfying chew, and unlike real jerky, you could actually eat a couple Primal Strips products and still have some jaw muscle left.  Also unlike real jerky, these are moist.  Because it's not dehydrated flesh, they're able to have moisture in the flavoring.  And they do a pretty good job on the flavoring, too!<br /><br />Bottom line: it ain't meat, but it's amazing for a plant!

I've never had real beef jerky before so the only way I could see someone giving this a bad review, is if it doesn't taste how someone would expect but whatever it taste like believe me, it's delicious! The jerky is not dry, because they seal in the perfect amount of sauce so its not wet, but moist!<br /><br />The particular packages I tried however looked different than the picture amazon has here so I'm not sure if Primal Spirit has changed their marketing recently and these are old pictures, or if when you order it, it will actually look like the picture shown. If you go to their website, the pictures on the website are exactly what I purchased from Whole Foods. I'd love to buy them online for the convenience but, I'd like to be sure they are the same packaging and not an older version<br /><br />Anyway, great product! Hope to try all the flavors soon!

review/summary: A Very Satisfying Snack
review/text: I love Primal Spirit Jerky.  I've tried several different flavors and some appealed more than others but, as a previous reviewer noted, that was more personal taste than because of any deficiency in product.  This is a very tasty snack that you can really sink your teeth into.  My sister used to buy me these at the end of a long day teaching middle schoolers and even on those days when I had skipped lunch (and breakfast) these snacks were very satisfying and so delicious that I was always happy to eat them.  Some of them are made from soy and some are made from seitan which is somewhat more chewy and stringy a food.  My preference is for seitan but surprisingly the soy was also very chewy and certainly very good.  I'm really glad the hikers who founded Primal Spirit went ahead with developing this product and I agree with them wholeheartedly that the meat-alternative foods outside the United States are generally much better and more varied and their product has benefited from that history of good vegetarian food in Asia.  Definitely going to order some of these now...Yum!

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: I was happy to see that I could purchase this on Amazon. Previously had to go to our local health food store. Price is about the same, more convenient to come to the house. High protein, low fat, tasty and give a energy boost on intense bike rides or anytime snack when you don't want a carb rush! :)

review/text: I too think these strips are a bit too sweet - but this one has 10 grams of protein. Now the that prices have gone up, it's close to what I would pay in the one store in my town that sells them. It also took weeks to get them with the free shipping.  So hmm...

review/summary: Really terrible! Try another flavor. Don't waste your money!
review/text: I am a big fan of Primal Strips. In fact, I loved the first flavor so much (Texas BBQ) I decided to buy others and really enjoyed it all with the exception of Mesquite Lime. Luckily, this was the last flavor I purchased and I was displeasantly surprised. I had a rough time even swallowing my first bite! Yes, it was that bad. The "lime" in this was horridly instense, very vinegar like. It is really all you can taste. So... if you like biting into a meaty-textured product with an overbearing flavor of vinegar, you may probably enjoy this flavor. Otherwise, if you are like me, stick to the other enjoyable, tasty flavors this wonderful vegan product has to offer.

review/text: I love this product as a way to get protein into vegans.  But...is the plastic that holds the product BPA free?  I called the manufacturer, and he said that he thought that it was.  I asked him for verification of this fact, because I give it to my kids.  He also mentioned that it is put in the plastic while hot, which is of concern to me, because bpa leaches into food when it is hot.  Love love love this product with this one caveat.  Please verify, Primal Spirit!

review/summary: Hard to open and messy, but good..........
review/text: This is the only veggie jerquee my local grocery store carries and is a good substitute for when I don't feel like ordering my favorite(stonewalls) online.<br />I like the flavor and the texture but I always need scissors to open the package and I hate the thought of my germy scissors touching my food.<br />Once you finally open it, it's hard to really get a good bite because it is very stringy and full of sauce, you usually end up with half the product in one bite just so you don't get sauce all over your hands and mouth.<br />I often get it stuck in my teeth too, which is annoying when I'm at work without dental floss.<br />I think they are redesigning the package so hopefully it will be easier to eat soon. They could work on the price too, $1.29 at the store for 2 bites is a bit ridiculous!

review/summary: Good flavor, but a wet mess
review/text: I got the teriyaki flavor and, while the flavor is good and the texture is also good once you get it into your mouth, it can be a mess getting it there.  As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward.

review/summary: Very tasty and healthy jerky snack!
review/text: Hi! I could eat a box of this vegan jerky at one sitting. Delicious! The hickory smoke flavor is mildly hot without burning. There's to be a hint of maple syrup or similar tasting spice in the flavor. Texture seems right. Chewy but soft enough. The strips came in an outer paper box. Easy enough to open. The individual wrappings are easy to open with scissors. Tougher to open by hand. Individual wrapping has a cut at top for peeling open. I had no luck that way. For taking these on a hike it's a good idea to bring scissors. I recommend this jerky for a great snacking experience. I hope to buy other flavors in future orders.

review/summary: Texas Barbecue is the only good one IMHO
review/text: My wife and I really didn't like any of these flavors, with the exception of the Texas BBQ.  It is a sweet barbecue, which I normally don't like.  Our kids selected the Texas BBQ as a trail snack for camping combined with some round crackers and ooh baby did it hit the spot.  That said, I think all the spicy Stonewall's jerky varieties and peppered Tofurky Jerky are a superior jerky.

Service was excellent - my order arrived within three days of ordering - and I live in AZ!

review/summary: The Best I've Found So Far
review/text: Okay, these are pretty darn tasty.  I have tried several different brands of veggie jerky, and so far, these are my faves.  I've tried several different flavors (Texas Barbecue ranks at the top of my list), and they're all pretty good.<br /><br />They are pretty moist, almost to the point of being a little saucy.  They can be just a bit messy to eat, but the benefit is that they are GREAT to eat on a sandwich!  Terrific by themselves and amazing on bread... makes me smile.<br /><br />The packaging can get a little frustrating.  They are serrated at the top, so in theory, you should be able to tear the edge and open the entire package along the side of the strip.  Unfortunately, it doesn't exactly work that well.  A lot of times it will rip off and make it difficult to get the strip out of the package.  I just use scissors now.  Just a minor complaint.<br /><br />But seriously, these things are delicious.  Even my carnivorous friends like them (and it's usually impossible to get them to touch a substitute).  Definitely recommend!

review/text: SO GOOD.<br />Just in case anyone was wondering. I know every vegan/vegetarian says this, but even my carnivorous brother liked it. He's the crazy outdoors type though- savage all the way, carving things out of wood, building shelters in the woods, survival stuff. So I trust his meat-comparison ratings. Most veggie people, when it comes to fake meat, tend to say "it's all about the sauce". While this is true, this also has the texture. It's more of the soft slim-jim texture I remember (though we can argue- is that really meat? hah)- moist and moderately chewy. I'm curious if sticking these in a dehydrator will make them more jerky like. Anyway I like the mesquite lime. It's not too sweet, tangy and just delicious. I recommend!

review/text: Hickory Smoked Primal Jerky is awesome! Jerky is one of the few things I have really missed since becoming a vegetarian, this stuff is a fantastic replacement though. The flavor is great, not exactly the same as meat but still sweet and tangy like hickory smoked jerky should be. The texture is also excellent; not quite as tough as the real thing but close. Its fairly healthy too so I keep a few in my backpack as a quick awesome snack.

review/text: Before I was vegetarian, there were few meat products that I even liked. Jerky was one of them, and I have had no luck finding a replacement.<br /><br />This is NOTHING like real jerky. It is very chewy in a SOFT way, and the flavoring was overpowering to the point that I ended up with a stomachache.<br /><br />It is OK. I wouldn't buy it again, but it's not disgustingly bad or anything. Just know if you're looking for an alternative to jerky that this fails both the taste and texture test.

review/summary: Spirited Jerky Product
review/text: The package arrived promptly and all contents in excellent condition. The product is very tasty, though it is a slight bit too peppery for my taste. I have tried all their varieties, and I like this one and Texas BBQ best. The mesquite is also good, and much milder. They have the texture just right--you wouldn't know it wasn't meat if it were a blind taste test. It is a little wet as a jerky, which makes it a tad messy. Each packet contains a whopping 10 grams of protein! A lot of nutrition in a small, lightweight packet. Ideal for camping, keeping in the car glovebox,in a briefcase or bag, etc. for those times when you need a boost. But for the pepper, I would have given 5 stars, so I rate this 4 stars. Enjoy!

review/summary: Mesquite Lime flavor is the bomb diggity
review/text: As an omnivore, I loved beef jerky. My family would eat it all the time. As a vegan, I don't really feel the need to mimic the experience of eating beef jerky so I'm not really inclined to try out the various soy jerkys and what have you that are available. However, the mesquite lime (green packaging) is so good that it makes me say phrases that I never say (bomb diggity) and praise its deliciousness here so that all may come to know the little bit of tongue heaven that it is. Strong, bold flavor and perfect chewy texture. The only down side is that once you're done, you want more. Hence, get the pack of 24. The mesquite lime flavor is so good that I dare not try the other flavors any time soon and taint my Primal Strip food-gasmic journey.

I love that its only 75 calories and yet so high in protein. It's hard for me (as a vegetarian) to get enough protein while still keeping my carbs low. The standard protein bar usually has way too much sugar for my liking. These are a great afternoon snack and perfect after an intense workout.

review/text: I'm not a vegetarian, but I have trouble finding decent jerky and decided to try the Texas BBQ flavor. I did like the fact that it has a meaty texture, but not a hard leather texture that I tend to avoid in jerky. It was hard enough so that I had to floss my teeth to avoid irritation to my gums, but that's true with all meat. Besides texture, it also tasted like meat. However, it also tasted like someone was trying to make a BBQ flavored candy bar. Way too sweet, and just an overall bad taste. My dog goes nuts for them though, so they're not completely wasted.

review/text: And it's a good surprise!  I was cautious, expecting either something with no resemblance to meat, or something so rubbery as to be inedible.  Sure, the texture is not EXACTLY like real jerky, it's a bit liquidy for that.  But for a vegan product, outstanding!  It's chewy without being rubbery, far juicier than real jerky(which is a good thing), and tastes spot on.  Granted, the Texas BBQ doesn't taste the way I'd thought it would(I was expecting a tomato-y BBQ sauce flavor), but it's very good, with just the right amount of smoke.  I can't wait to try more flavors!

review/text: I've been a vegetarian for 10 years (all of my 20s) and absolutely love it!  Lately I've been really looking for good healthy protein sources that I actually like to eat, and these Primal Strips are excellent!  These things scare me because they are so realistically meat-like.<br />I've tried 3 flavors of them so far, and there was only 1 that I thought wasn't great.  It was completely edible, but the texture was just not as good as the others.  I think it was the Teriyaki that I didn't like so much, but I really liked the Texas Barbecue and the Hickory Smoked flavors.<br /><br />These are excellent low-calorie, low-fat, convenient, tasty snacks with high amounts of protein.  You can take them anywhere, keep them in your desk at work or in your purse!<br /><br />The only complaint I have about these is that I wish there were versions with lower sodium.  To me, as someone who loves a good salty snack, but knows that too much salt is not good and tries to avoid it, these taste too salty.  And 300+ mg of sodium per strip seems high.<br /><br />But in the end I am overlooking the sodium and am purchasing these in bulk now!  I just bought the Thai Peanut flavor because I love spicy foods, and I love Thai food!  I'll update this review with my thoughts on this flavor after I receive them.<br /><br />UPDATE: I received the Thai Peanut flavor and LOVE them!  They have a great chewy texture, good flavor, and a good amount of spice.  All for only 74 calories each, but 10g protein!  I definitely recommend these!

review/text: This jerky really is delicious! I am a vegetarian, I am always getting picked on for eating my "rabbit food," but everyone I have got to taste this couldn't believe it wasn't meat, and they loved it too.

review/summary: Really good!
review/text: I ordered the hickory smoked soy jerky, and was very impressed. It had some type of sauce on it that surprised me (don't know if this is typical of all flavors), but was delicious. I have in the last few months purchased the Vegan Dreams variety pack...a drier, thinner and chewier product, but not necessarily less tasty. The sauciness on my Primal hickory smoked might lend itself to heating it up for different vegan meals, as it is more juicy. I look forward to trying the other varieties.<br />I just tried the Texas Bar-b-que, and I really like this flavor as well. This version seems to be a bit less "saucy", but just as moist and delicious. It does have a "stringy" texture to it that makes dental floss a must! In the search for a good veggie jerky, I am leaning towards the Primal line.

review/summary: Bought by accident, bought again on purpose
review/text: I bought this product by accident one morning at a local deli, and I was very surprised when I first ate it.  Granted, you can easily tell (and I was scared because I was expecting beef jerky when I first bit it) that it is not meat.  But, as an alternative, it is very tasty, and I did end up buying it again.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I like most varieties of Primal Strips. They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (10g protein, 3g fat, 8g carbs.). The Hickory Smoked variety is very flavorful with a little bit of a spicy kick. The texture is somewhat firm, which I enjoy, but it often gets stuck between my teeth so I always need to have some dental floss handy. I would say that of all the varieties of Primal Strips, this is currently my favorite.

The Thai Peanut variety is very tasty with a little bit of a kick. The texture is firm, which I enjoy, but it typically gets stuck between my teeth so I always need to have some dental floss handy.
