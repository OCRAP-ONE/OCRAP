review/summary: Almost as good as canned and so much more convenient
review/text: I was looking for powdered coconut milk for a backpacking meal.  I had to use an extra tablespoon from what the package called for to get the same flavor as canned, but otherwise it was great.  The boxes are large and came as a four-pack, so I shared with some friends.  I've used it at home a few times as well and its great to have on hand.  No more half-used cans of coconut milk to deal with!

review/summary: Not Vegan at All!
review/text: I bought this product to make some vegan milk soap. However, after reading the ingredients "...sodium caseinate (From Milk)..." and that is how it is worded. I thought, does not mean animal milk? So I did a google, and sure enough caseinate is produced from mammals, usually derived from cows for food purposes. Do not waste your money if you are looking for vegan here, it is not. If you care not about vegan, I still do not recommend this product because it comes from Sri Lanka, which means it supports the concentration camps of the Tamil civilians. I know this because my husband is Tamilian. Thank God we do not live in Sri Lanka. Google no to Sri Lanka if you need more evidence.

I'm not going to fool with this any more; Lord knows what's actually in the bottle.  It goes into the garbage.  Henceforth, unless Amazon states clearly the Country of Origin, I'll pass on their products.

review/summary: Toxic ingredients. Horrible for dogs.
review/text: I spent 5 years studying canine nutrition and it's because of hype marketing such as this that dogs have such increased health issues. This is created for profit rather than for pets.<br /><br />Why do I say this?<br /><br />On the label it says "100% Real"  Note that it doesn't say real WHAT.  So then you see "No artificial flavors or colors" and you think you are giving your dog real beef, right? Nope.<br /><br />Turn the package over and look more closely.  Yes, it has beef but guess what the second and third ingredients are? SALT and SUGAR. After that we have smoke flavor, potassium sorbate (an artificial preservative...note it said there were no artificial flavors or colors. It did NOT say no artificial ingredients and it did not say all natural.) then Caramel Sodium Erythurbate, then Sodium Nitrate, (Sodium nitrate, a chemical, forms nitrosamines - carcinogens known to cause DNA damage and increased cellular degeneration. Studies have shown a link between increased levels of nitrates and increased deaths from certain diseases including Alzheimer's, diabetes mellitus and Parkinson's in people, possibly through the damaging effect of nitrosamines on DNA. Nitrosamines, formed in cured meats containing sodium nitrate and nitrite, have been linked to gastric cancer and oesophageal cancer.Sodium nitrate and nitrite are associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer.World Cancer Research Fund UK,states that one of the reasons that processed meat increases the risk of colon cancer is its content of nitrate. A small amount of the nitrate added to meat as a preservative breaks down into nitrite, in addition to any nitrite that may also be added. The nitrite then reacts with protein-rich foods (such as meat) to produce N-nitroso compounds (NOCs). Some types of NOCs are known to cause cancer. NOCs can be formed either when meat is cured or in the body as meat is digested.then BHA (The US National Institutes of Health report that BHA is reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen based on evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. In particular, when administered in high doses as part of their diet, BHA causes papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach) It is a preservative.<br /><br />THEN ONION EXTRACT. ONIONS ARE TOXIC TO DOGS!<br /><br />It is unfortunately true that many companies add sugar as a main ingredient to treats so that dogs will crave treats...they do not brush their teeth so you are entering bacteria into their mouths on top of what is already there and this eventually actually affects their livers and kidneys. With onion ingredients you are hurting their livers and kidneys more by having to filter out this toxin on top of all the artificial ingredients.<br /><br />They are smaller than people and it's far more difficult for them to process these ingredients than it is for us.<br /><br />There are dirt cheap jerky treats for dogs that have all natural ingredients.  Don't fall for the false labeling. The very fact that they label this as they do proves what's important to them...not knowledge of getting the best for your dog, but filling it with cheap ingredients for profit.<br /><br />As someone who has studied things like this for years as well as the beneficial affects of a natural diet, this simply sickens me.

review/summary: Oh La La!
review/text: Wooo hoooo my third matcha today. Its been a long busy crazy kind of day with the need to multitask, be sociable, run errand, work, make phone calls, help family out, entertain teen girls with girl talk time, and go go go. Thanks to the power of matcha it has been a breeze! Now I am waiting on the husband to get home from work hopefully within the next hour or so and spend maybe one hour of quality time with him before I can unwind silently on my own perhaps doing some reading. However, I am going for this cup to carry me through till that time.<br /><br />So I am indulging in some french vanilla matcha from Red Leaf Tea linked above.<br /><br />This is one of the smoothest matcha yet from Red Leaf. A lot like Bavarian Cream it is very velvety and creamy. I think I prefer this over the madagascar vanilla because this one seems to be a bit more vanillay more in your face a term I over use but everyone who follows me pretty much knows I like my flavors to be strong. Between the two, if you want something more mellow and laid back then Madagascar Vanilla is your cup of tea, but if you want something sinfully smooth, rich, thick, and creamy, then French Vanilla is the one for you.<br /><br />I will probably do a bit more exploring of all the flavors Red Leaf Tea has to offer before ordering a larger quantity however I am pretty sure French Vanilla would make that list. I mean you can mix it with other flavors to get a more creamy texture and flavor out of them such as mixing Caramel matcha with French Vanilla but then I think I could do the same thing with Cheesecake, or Bavarian Cream so the list of possible mixes goes on and on!<br /><br />This is one that has a permanent home in my matcha stash!

review/summary: My One True Matcha Love
review/text: Now, those who follow me and my reviews know I can't stop raving about the Madagascar Vanilla from Red Leaf Teas. I'm almost out of it already, it's the one I reach for the most and when people ask which one they should try first, my immediate answer is "Vanilla. Oh my goodness, the vanilla."<br /><br />But Madagascar's reign may soon be over.<br /><br />French Vanilla is my one true love. French Vanilla anything. Vanilla was my favorite ice cream flavor before I gave up ice cream. French Vanilla is the ice cream flavor I will risk my dairy allergy for. It's just so creamy and rich and guh, so good. So when Red Leaf Tea let me know they had a new matcha out, a French Vanilla, I was sold. It immediately went into my cart and I feverishly finished my other reviews so I could order it as soon as possible.<br /><br />I opened the package this morning and almost drooled. It smells like icing. Like I had just opened up a new tub of Betty Crocker vanilla frosting. Oh god, I want to drown in it. It's almost too sweet for this early in the morning, but I don't care! I have to have some of this now! I'll make bacon later to make up for it.<br /><br />It...it's perfect. It's everything I ever dreamed of in a vanilla matcha. Everything. Creamy, smooth, beyond amazing. I want to shout from the rooftops that I've found The One, the tea I've been searching for forever, the tea that is the reason I own 6 different vanilla rooibos and 8 variations on a vanilla black. This tea is my holy grail. It's matcha, which I have come to love and value over almost any other tea, and it's that French Vanilla goodness that rocks my world. I know it seems like I've gone a bit crazy, but this is just...guh. It's fulfilling my ice cream cravings, my icing cravings, my everything cravings.<br /><br />That said, I will likely keep the Madagascar around for mixing, as it seems to blend beautifully with other flavors, but when I want to sit down and just enjoy a good cup of matcha, the French Vanilla is what I will be reaching for. Oh yes, my pretty. We will have a long, happy life together. Red Leaf Tea, I honestly cannot thank you enough for introducing this blend.

review/summary: The Best Mosquito Killer and Repellant for Your Yard
review/text: I live in an area in Minnesota where mosquitoes are numerous and extremely bothersome.  Since we have relatively short summers, I look forward to the summer season to enjoy the outdoors, but mosquitoes will literally ruin the summer season if not treated.  In addition, mosquitoes carry West Nile Disease, and a dear friend several houses away contracted this disease while working in his yard.  He was severely ill for months, and was lucky to survive.  To protect my family, I decided to take my yard back from the blood-sucking, disease-carrying demoms.  I first tried one of the mosquitoe magnet devices, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000094YKM">Mosquito Magnet MM4000 Defender Mosquito Trap</a>,but despite its great hype (and price!), it did not eliminated the biting tormentors.  I then sprayed the yard with an application of Cutter Bug-Free Backyard.  The results were stunning!  For the first time in many summer seasons, the yard was virtually free of mosquitoes. I have been using this product ever since, and am quite satisfied with it.  For me it works better than any other product I've tried.  The best feature of this product is that it both kills and then repells mosquitoes and bugs.  I have found that it lasts about 3 weeks maximum, and that is dependent on the weather.  If it rains hard after applying the repellent, I know I will have to reapply the chemical to the yard.  A light rain does not seem to affect the repellant quality. Although Cutter advertizes an 8-week mosquito-free period, this is entirely inaccurate; the product must be applied every 2-3 weeks for effective mosquito control<br /><br />The active ingredient is Permethrin.  Permethrin is extremely toxic to fish and aquatic life, so if you have a backyard pond, avoid spraying this area.  It is also highly toxic to cats, since they lick their fur and ingest the toxin.  Cutter warns to keep all pets off the lawn until the application is completely dry.  Spray the yard from the outside perimeter in.  You don't want to get the chemical on your feet, as it will cause a tingling sensation (it is a neurotoxin and is classified as a "likely" carcinogen.  There is also a link to Parkinson's disease).  Wear heavy shoes or rubber boots when applying.  Cutter instructions say to wet down the yard first, but I usually apply in the early AM when dew is still present. Avoid applying in windy conditions as you don't want this stuff blowing back on you.  Cutter says to not apply more than 14 treatments per year.<br /><br />The product can be applied by simply attaching the nozzle to your hose and spraying.  Spray every single piece of greenery possible, as well as the sides of dwelling, window screens, etc.  The wider the perimeter, the better the control of mosquitoes.<br /><br />While there are risks in using any chemical, I apply the chemical carefully per instructions and avoid getting any on my body. The danger of West Nile Disease is significant in this area, and I'd rather apply Cutter's Bug-Free Backyard than avoid going outside.<br /><br />konedog

review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
review/text: This product has to be one of the most frustrating products that I have used in years.  The dispensing system doesn't work at all.  I bought two bottles and, with each, spent about 45 minutes spraying the lawn while getting eaten by mosquitoes before realizing that not a single drop of teh active ingredients were actually getting dispensed out the hose.  Fortunately I had an older bottle with a better dispenser and used that bottle to spray.  Unfortunately, that dispenser eventually fell apart, and when I needed a new bottle, I was back with the latest dispenser.  For this third bottle, the entire dispenser blew up in my face when I turned on the nozzle, so I got the chemical in my eyes, my mouth, my hair, everywhere.  Absolute POS.  The people at Cutter should be mortified that they sell a product that is this crappy.

It is a press fit plastic piece that doesn't seem to be able to take any water pressure. Defeats the whole purpose.<br /><br />2) Two, there is a plastic safety tab that you have to press back to turn on the valve. When I bent the tab back (instruction as is molded in plastic) the whole valve fell apart.<br /><br />It looks as though no one at cutters ever tested one of these applicators before sending them off to the stores.

review/summary: The worst horsesh*t product ever created ever.
review/text: I should have known better and heeded the advice of those that had reviewed before me. I picked up a bottle of this horsecrap at Lowe's after trying some of the EcoSMART Mosquito & Tick Control and failing to eradicate my backyard mosquito problem. I figured, how hard could it be to manufacture a garden hose attached spray bottle and adhere to Bernoulli's principle. Apparently the answer is "very."<br /><br />I followed the directions line by line to be sure I didn't screw anything up. I shook the container well. I attached the garden hose to my ready spray nozzle. I made sure the dial was in the off position. Then when I got to step 4 all hell broke loose. I turned the water on carefully (at the faucet, just like the directions said). I hadn't even turned the water on all the way, maybe just 25%, and I noticed from across the lawn that the ready spray nozzle was readily spraying water out the back of the nozzle at extreme pressure. I mean EXTREME pressure. Little tiny streams of super pressurized water that could cut through flesh with more efficiency than a .50 caliber. That lasted for approximately 7 seconds until the entire hose, complete with the screw-on portion of the ready spray nozzle, exploded away from the rest of the container and fired the hose back about 3 feet.<br /><br />Like any good homeowner would do at that point, I turned off the water and strolled over to survey the damage. Thankfully, it looked repairable. I unscrewed the blue screw-end off the hose, making sure that the rubber washer came with it and then forcefully jammed it back onto the end of the nozzle. Maybe I had screwed it onto the hose too tightly, maybe I had turned the water on too fast with too much pressure. I figured what the hell, I'll try it again. 2nd time, same result. 3rd time, same result.<br /><br />For my next attempt I figured I'd outsmart the bugger and skip ahead a few steps. So before turning the water on, I bent the safety tab back and turned the dial clockwise until it stopped. I thought to myself, "Sweet, water will automatically mix with the product when I turn the hose on and I'll eliminate my back pressure problem. Rock on." Naturally my next move was to turn the water on. In hindsight, this was clearly a terrible move. I turned the water on and from the other side of the lawn everything looked to be in order. The sprayer was spraying and the hose was still attached. I jogged over and picked up the bottle and started to walk at a steady pace while spraying using an even sweeping motion, slightly overlapping the areas to be treated. But as soon as I moved the bottle around a little bit, the little tiny streams of super pressurized flesh destroying water returned with a vengeance and began nailing me in the face with anger and rage. I refused to lose and restrained both the hose and the nozzle with both hands using an overhand death grip most likely taught in MMA schools throughout Brazil and other parts of South America.<br /><br />I finally had it under control. The spray was coming out the right end and the hose remained attached to the bottle. Never mind that the muscles in my hands were quickly starting to burn from the sheer force that I had to apply to keep the whole system intact and operating. But whatever, it was working. After a couple minutes of running around my yard like a blind monkey on acid, I decided to look into the clever little window they build into the side of the bottle to make sure that the chemical was actually coming out with the stream of water. Nothing. Hadn't gone down even a centimeter. I set the bottle onto the ground carefully making sure not to loosen up the insanity driven choke grip that I had on the bottle and I watched. I watched for 5 minutes. I smelled the spray coming out looking for any sign of the chemicals. Nothing. Not a god damned thing. The only thing coming out of that sprayer was water.<br /><br />I blinked. It must have been a little longer than average because by the time I opened my eyes the whole thing was over. I was soaking wet. Shoes, shirt, shorts, face, everything. The bottle was laying several feet away. The hose was by my side quietly pouring water onto the lawn. A bird chirped in the distance. At least it was over. After a good fight it was time to accept defeat and move on with my life.<br /><br />I may never be the same after this day. I suspect that the events will be replayed in my mind over and over until I'm left drooling in a corner somewhere mumbling to myself. But before that happens I must warn the others. Don't buy this product. Never buy this product.

review/text: The first one of these I tried last year worked fine. It sprayed fine and in conjunction with the Mosquito Magnet I have, kept the mosquito population down. However, the second one I tried had a head malfunction and ened up pushing water into the bottle instead of sucking the insecticide out. Luckily I still had my original bottle and swapped the heads over. This year I bought a third bottle thinking that last year's malfunction was a one-off. After 5 minutes of spraying I noticed that the bottle contents weren't going down. I tried resetting the on/off a couple of times but it still wasn't delivering the contents. I tried several more tricks to try to get this thing to work but after around 45 minutes I gave up having effectively watered my entire garden. This one will be going back to the store for replacement and next time I'll be using something other than Cutter.

review/text: Absolute garbage!  Unfortunaltely zero stars is not an option.  "Konedog", tell your employer, Cutter, to stop selling crap plastic applicators!  This sprayer is so cheap and poorly designed that you are destine to wind up wearing more bug spray than you'll ever get on your yard.  The hose end coupler is too deep (tried it on two different hoses) so there is water leaking/spraying all around the coupling even before you begin to spray.  Once you get going the draw tube is rediculously ineffective and isn't moving material.  Try bumping up the pressure to draw something out of the container and the hose coupler pops of the cheap snap-on fitting to the spray nozzle.  I threatened my wife that if she ever bought another Cutter product I would promptly drive her back to store to obtain a refund.<br /><br />Ortho, Bonide, Raid...any of them have to be better than the garbage Cutter is trying to pass off.

review/summary: DO NOT BUY
review/text: As with other reviewers, I got so far then Cutter stopped coming out around the 16 oz. mark. What is even more frustrating is filling out the entire customer contact questionnaire on their website including UPC, lot #, and personal info then the "submit" button conveniently doesn't work (nor did "enter").  I know that I am not in alone in the feeling of being constantly jerked around by these corporations that are only looking out for their stockholders which, obviously,  no longer includes customer satisfaction.  When this happens to me, I stop doing business with the offending company period, end of story, bye-bye. If more of us did this, it would speak volumes....just saying

review/summary: Doesn't Work Like it Did a Few Years Ago
review/text: Cutter 32 oz. Backyard Bug Control Spray Concentrate is no longer effective. I used to be able to spray my yard with this and mosquitoes would disappear for about 10-14 days.<br /><br />Something happened in the last year or so. First, the applicator is terrible. I noticed that the solution doesn't even come out most of the time, only water. I notice that I am spraying my entire yard, but the same level of bug spray is still in the bottle. I tried 3 different bottles and the same thing happened each time. I had to manually open the hole with a stick to get any solution to come out.<br /><br />Even with the hole now slightly open and the solution flowing out, the product flat out does not work. My yard is still infested with mosquitoes after spraying.<br /><br />Will not purchase this again. Now I'm stuck with $30 of spray that doesn't work b/c I don't have my receipt to return them.

review/summary: The Good and the Bad
review/text: First, the bad:<br />Like most other people leaving bad reviews, the first bottle I hooked up wasted about ten minutes of my time before I noticed that none of the bug killer was leaving the bottle as I sprayed around the yard. In fact, the on/off dial came right off, spraying the junk all over the place and on me, until I was able to get it back and turned "on."  But it would not spray the bug killing ingredients.<br />Soooo, I hooked up another bottle to the hose and it worked fine.  I found that all you need to do is keep the working sprayer (if you have one that works) hooked up to the hose and just change out the bottles, hooking a new full bottle to the sprayer part that you keep hooked to the hose.<br /><br />Is this a bit of a pain?  Well, not really, because you'd have to unhook a used up bottle and connect a new one anyhow. Should they work without having to do this?  Yes.  So shame on the manufacturers for making a bottle/sprayer that does not do what it should...guaranteed. Truly pitiful.<br /><br />Now, the good:<br />I used to use this product a day before backyard parties and have never had mosquitoes at any of my parties.  But a couple days ago, I decided to spray all around my house (grass, slate walkway, mulch, leaves, bushes).  Today I walked around the entire yard and stone patio, and to my astonishment did not see even one ant or creepy crawly of any kind.  This seems totally impossible. Because I live in the country, where there are at least 5 deer grazing at any one time, a dozen squirrels, moles, raccoons, turkeys, chipmunks...you name it, I got it. And my house is right next to Limestone Creek and covered with hundreds of trees, so it's basically Bug Central. But today...NOTHING.  Not a bug of any kind.  On this walkaround, I would expect to see probably 200-300 ants easy.  Today?  Not one.  I don't know why I didn't use Bug-Free Backyard as a general bug maintenance program before.<br /><br />So if you get a bottle that will work properly, keep the sprayer portion and use that one for your other bottles.  Do that and this product is pretty much a lock to make your yard and your summers totally bug free.

It looks like there is a defect in the mechanism involving the sprayer.  Do not purchase this item until it is fixed or the device is changed, it will simply waste your money.  The same device is on several other products, all of which I have had the same issues with.  The sprayer head on the Ortho Weed-be-Gone seems to work the best, however.  I would just remove it and use it on this one, but they are not compatible.

review/summary: Piece of Crap & Dangerous!!
review/text: This  ready-to-spray bottle from Cutter is, to put it softly, a piece of crap. The bottle is designed to be hooked to the hose. The problem is that once you hook the hose up, there are two places where the bottle itself will come apart - at the neck of the bottle and where the hose connects to the bottle. These two joints will just pop up w/ little resistance under normal use. The end result is danger to the person holding the bottle. Imagine spraying and the bottle comes apart w/ the liquid all over you.<br /><br />Whoever designed and approved this bottle should be fired.

We weren't swarmed, but there were mosquitos biting. Had to light citronella candles and put those around which did seem to solve the problem. Cutter used to work for at least a week. I sprayed carefully and completely and really covered the deck area which is where we were sitting.<br />Also, the connector on the sprayer that attaches to the hose kept popping off. I think had to turn off the hose and press down to reconnect. Happened 2 times, so that's a lot of trouble.

review/summary: Once a Godsend, Now disappointing
review/text: I have used this product for years, about 15 years. It originally had something specifically about "mosquitoes" in the title. For the majority of that time, it has been absolutely fantastic, clearing out mosquitoes for an extended period of time. I frequently recommended it, and anyone trying it was also impressed. Naturally, it was a five-star product.<br /><br />Now, there are two issues. The first is that the sprayers are defective. You might get lucky and get one that actually sprays (that is, the product level in the bottle goes down as you're spraying) or that doesn't fall apart due to the cheap plastic, but for the past couple of years (about 30 bottles or so) I would say 80% of the time I had to pour the contents into a different sprayer. I read in a different review that you can hold the bottle upside down to get it to spray properly, so I will have to try that. In any case, if the spraying mechanism were the only problem, you could buy the concentrate bottles instead of the sprayers.<br /><br />The bigger issue is that the formula seems to be different, and it's not killing bugs the way it used to. This has been a hard issue to confirm because it has coincided with the changes in the bottle (that is, the defective sprayer) so I can't say that the distribution has been exactly the same; also, bugs do tend to adapt to pesticides, so I couldn't rule that out as a possibility. After more tests and reading other reviews, I'm pretty convinced that it's a different formula: for one thing, it smells different (weaker) even when it's spraying out properly. Other people I had recommended the Cutter spray to also find that it's had diminished effectiveness.<br /><br />I would rate it only one star, but my successful history with its predecessors brought another star.

review/summary: The worst and malfunction bug spray ever!
review/text: I purchased this bug spray because on the cover it says it covers many types of insects. When my husband and I tried to spray the outside of the house (we have both fly and ants problems), it requires the use of hose. I felt kinda lucky because if we don't have one then we can't use it and not everyone has a hose somewhere handy in the house and it didn't say anywhere on the bottle that it requires usage of a hose. Anyway, when we connected the bottle to the hose, after a few water pumping, the cap part got disconnected from the water pressure so the water from the hose just came out and shot my husband from head to toe. Alright, we reconnected it again. It did the same thing. So it took forever to spray the out side of the house, with my husband's cursing, water splashing, bottle falling, and trying to keeping the hose connected to the cap. It was such a hassle that I had to write something about this product to warn the other customers who is considering purchasing this product.

review/text: I have lots of bugs everywhere: under my deck, on top of my deck, beyond the deck, in my front yard, in my bushes, in my flower bed.  So I was given this by a neighbor and sprayed both her lawn and mine with it.  The only thing that this seem to bother were the black thatch beetles (not japanese beetles)that apparently don't do much harm to lawns.  I just saw them scatter about with a few dead ones on the lawn after I sprayed. Other than that, the little black ants are still everywhere, as are spiders, and springtails.<br /><br />All in all, if you have a really bad bug problem like I do---don't use this because it's too weak.  This made no real difference in killing the bugs I wanted to kill.

review/text: I have been a long time user of Cutter's Backyard Bug Control but problems with the sprayer began a couple of years ago for me. The chemicals work fine and does last awhile but maybe not as long as claimed. The sprayer of a few years ago meant it was difficult to get the product out. I switched to another vendor and tried Cutter's again this year. Well, it got worse because a plastic piece of the head broke off immediately after I attached the hose and turned it on. I will not be getting this product again. Their quality control for dispensing the product is the worse I have seen for a major name brand.

review/text: I havent had the hose connectivity problems that everyone else had.  Maybe they turned too much water pressure on?  All you need is a trickle from your faucet and the pressure built up will do the rest.  Too much water pressure and of course the connector will blow off.  Anyway, I spray it and my yard is bug free for like 4-5 days.  Longer with no rain, maybe up to 2 weeks.  But after that the mosquitos come back with a vengence so I have to be vigilant about application.  I must first cover myself head to toe in bug spray, then try to apply this without getting bit, then hope it doesnt rain this week or else the next day my yard will be a mosquito haven again.  When it doesnt work I would say there is a 90% reduction in mosquitos (I still wear bug spray and get bitten) but thats better than a bite every 5 minutes, which is what happens without any protection, even when i AM wearing bug spray.<br /><br />If you have a small enough yard like me, maybe 1/8th an acre, one bottle can provide 3 applications.  But you still have to do it weekly, not the 8 weeks that the label promotes.

review/text: First of all, this is not the same chemical as the older Cutter Backyard Bug Control from a few years back. On Amazon it says this product is "2.5% Permethrin," however it is now made with 0.16% Lambda-Cyhalothrin. I don't think it works as well as the older product.<br /><br />The dispensing mechanism is messed up on all of these newer bottles. I was able to fix it by drilling out the hole in the nozzle where the dispensing straw is attached with a 1/8" drill bit. You have to turn the white selector knob to full-on before you drill and you have to stop drilling when you get through the white part. See my photos. After doing this, I reconnected everything and turned on the hose. After a couple of taps on the side of the bottle, the product dispensed just like it is supposed to.

So, if you get all the steps and get the product distributed, it does kill the mosquitoes for some period of time.  We'll reapply this weekend.

review/summary: Nothing Eliminates Mosquitoes
review/text: Nothing eliminates mosquitoes, unless you are going to spend a lot of time and money.  Unless you are Disneyworld using industrial fumigators, then you will always have a problem.<br /><br />DEET that you spray on the skin works best!  This may not be an option with toddlers or a party.<br /><br />This product is used to help REDUCE the amount of pest in the general vicinity.<br /><br />Tips:  Spray the yard Cutter a few days before the party.  Spray the Cutter fogger on the deck/patio perimeter a few hours before the party.<br /><br />All those citronella stuff doesn't really that well, because it flies straight up in the air.  It's good to have a few Tiki torches up to help distract them with smoke.  Mosquitoes hate smoke more than the citronella or chemicals from the coils.  So if you have a fire pit, light it up to add a little smoke.  I recommend OFF! Powerpad lantern as an alternative.<br />If you don't want to deal with all those candles and torches, then use a large fan if it's hot outside.  Mosquitoes cannot latch on more than 1MPH winds.<br /><br />CO2 trappers works best away from your general area, since it will attract more mosquitoes to them.  Bug zappers are not effective on mosquitoes.  It will kill those HUGE mosquitos looking ones that are actually harmless crane flies.  You are killing good bugs that are attracted to light and mosquitoes like to hide in the dark.  So it's best to buy a house where the sun sets in your backyard and build a cedar deck for a few more hours of freedom.<br /><br />Got an extremely horrible mosquito problem, then you should fumigate or raise some bats.  Sneak around your neighbors to make sure they don't have plastic, plate, bowl, flowerpots, cans, or tarp that is collecting water.

While I was spraying the product I could see hundreds of them swarming around on my patio. The fogger spray by cutter has kept the bugs off of my front door which is how they get into my home.<br /><br />Several people commented that the plastic broke. I had the attachment screw pop off from the water pressure. I snapped it back on and then I turned down the water pressure. This solved the problem and it didn't pop off again. The instructions don't say how much to turn on the faucet but I would keep the stream low to prevent the problems other people had.<br /><br />The area I treated is covered and we live in Arizona so it should stay dry. I hope this product lasts the full 8 weeks.

review/text: I have tried several other products to kill the insects in my back yard and have never had the success I have had with the Cutter Bug Free Backyard Insect repellent.  Due to the weather this summer it was impossible to enjoy the swimming pool without the mosquitos eating us up, but after spraying with the Cutter Bug Free Backyard Insect Repellent, we enjoyed our back yard and pool all summer.

review/summary: Save Your Money
review/text: I thought this was the answer to our mosquito problems.  NOT!!!!<br /><br />I followed the directions and made sure I soaked everything with this stuff: Grass, Bushes, Plants, etc.  Now I was sure my guests and I would be problem-free for our bonfire.  This was surely not the case.  As dusk approached it was if someone rang the dinner bell for the mosquito population.  All ten of us were being attached ferociously by the mosquito infantry.<br /><br />We ended up getting out the Off with deet to curb their appetite but they continued to look for any flaws in our defenses.  Then I remembered that years back I bought a bug light (uses UV light and fries bugs).  I plugged in the bug zapper and watched in amazement as those pesky little critters began to fry in droves.  As the frying continued so did the buzzing of these pesky little beasts.<br /><br />I wasted my money on purchasing this product but now you'll know too that this is not the abswer to your problems.  Look elsewhere my friend or you too will be throwing away your cash as I did.

review/summary: The first day and I'm satisfied so far
review/text: I rented a place at the beach for a week and the mosquitoes swarmed us when we arrived. Big ones with no fear. Several at one time would lite on my legs and arms allowing me to smash them instead of flying. They must have been real hungry. I talked to a guy at Ace Hardware about the problem. He recommended the Cutter Backyard Bug Control. Said he had a friend who practically had stock in the stuff. I went back and sprayed as far as the hose would reach around the house. This was right about dark. The next morning at 6 am I walked the dog and there wasn't even one mosquito.<br /><br />Let me compare my experience to others.<br />The sprayer worked fine for me down to about two ounces. I held the sprayer at different angles trying to get the suction tube to pick up the liquid but it didn't work. In he end I had to just pour the last two ounces out onto the ground.<br />Since this is my first day after applying the stuff I'll see if it lasts for the week.<br /><br />From the other reviews I may have been lucky my sprayer worked as well as it did and ended up with only two ounces that wouldn't spray.  I'll update this if the mosquitoes return before the week is over.

review/text: I read all the reviews so far, and yep, the spray nozzle is pretty junky but I bought enough bottles to swap them out when I needed to. It is worth it to have even a week or two with less mosquitoes. You really need to watch the fluid level in the container and make sure it is sucking.  I use about half the container and then half of another and keep combining them to get a whole one....I know it is not a wonderful process, but the stuff works and is better than getting West Nile or coating your entire body DEET with is ALSO toxic.

review/summary: Permethrin is not environmentally safe.
review/text: The active ingredient in this product is Permethrin.<br /><br />Permethrin, like all synthetic pyrethroids, is a neurotoxin. Symptoms include tremors, incoordination, elevated body temperature, increased aggressive behavior, and disruption of learning. Laboratory tests suggest that permethrin is more acutely toxic to children than to adults.<br /><br />The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has classified permethrin as a carcinogen because it causes lung tumors in female mice and liver tumors in mice of both sexes. Permethrin inhibits the activity of the immune system in laboratory tests, and also binds to the receptors for a male sex hormone. It causes chromosome aberrations in human and hamster cells.<br /><br />Permethrin is toxic to honey bees and other beneficial insects, fish, aquatic insects, crayfish, and shrimp. For many species, concentrations of less than one part per billion are lethal. Permethrin causes deformities and other developmental problems in tadpoles, and reduces the number of oxygen-carrying cells in the blood of birds.<br /><br />Permethrin has been found in streams and rivers throughout the United States. It is also routinely found on produce, particularly spinach, tomatoes, celery, lettuce, and peaches. A wide variety of insects have developed resistance to permethrin. High levels of resistance have been documented in cockroaches, head lice, and tobacco budworm.<br /><br />[...]

I figured Amazon may have a discount like with most of their items.. maybe one day.

review/summary: Best bagged hay for small animals that I've seen
review/text: After trying different brands of 'store-bought' hay and getting frustrated at constantly having to throw away the soiled leftovers that my two rabbits wouldn't eat, I discovered Zupreem's Nature's Promise western timothy hay. They absolutely love it! The hay has a softer, more appetizing appeal than some other bagged hays (such as Kaytee, or even Oxbow) and with every purchase I've made of this hay so far, it is always fresh and has a deep, wonderful aroma. I can't keep enough in the hay rack now...it used to be that my rabbits would nibble at their hay and then just spread the rest about the floor, but now they eat every strand (and I provide them with LOTS!). For an animal such as a rabbit, where the bulk of their diet should be a good-quality hay, and where it is imperative for their digestive health to consume plenty of hay, this brand is wonderful, and is a godsend for anyone whose rabbits are picky eaters.

review/summary: Barely edible
review/text: Perhaps quality changes from batch to batch, but the batch I received is very brown. My rabbit makes a huge mess flinging the hay around the cage looking for some edible portion. I would definitely have asked for a refund, but I would have forfeited $19 of my $25 investment in shipping (here and back). So I figured my bunny could surely find $6 of good hay in an 8lb bag, at considerable aggravation to me in clean-up. Generally I give products a second chance, but due to the cost in shipping I will have to pass on ZuPreem's Nature's Promise Western Timothy Hay in future.

review/summary: Best quality I've seen
review/text: I've been a pretty loyal Oxbow buyer (I was just horrified by the quality of anything else), but lately the quality has been hit-or-miss. Half the bags were stiff bits that went to waste; a good bag would last two weeks, a bad one would be gone in 5 days. I wanted to look into buying in greater quantities but was worried by Oxbow reviews that their larger bags were even lower quality than their pet store bags! Several Oxbow reviews ushered us to check out Zupreem, so we ordered this 8-pound bag. It's very soft and green, and quite fragrant. I grew up helping on my grandpa's farm, and this stuff smells like riding the hay wagon back from the fields. We definitely plan to continue buying Zupreem over Oxbow!

I heat it up in the microwave and serve it with a slight coating of Devon Custard. It's quite good. Very pleasantly sweet and tasty. A nice dessert. My only complaint would be that it has a very high sugar content resulting in a very high calorie count. The pudding is quite delicious, but I'll have to restrain myself as to how often it is served.

review/summary: Delicious for a packaged convenience food
review/text: Make no mistake... this is a pre-packaged, instant convenience food.  That said, it's quite good for what it is.  Also easy to make: add water, microwave one minute on high, stir, microwave 4 minutes on low.  I prefer that method to the microwave 2 minutes, let stand 10 minutes directions of many other Dr McDougall's soups.  Unfortunately, my microwave doesn't have a high or low setting so it was just a little dry by the end of the last 4 minutes.  I'd probably do 2 or 3 minutes for the second microwaving and see how that goes next time.<br /><br />I also think the packaging is a little misleading.  It looks similar to the packaging of products like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E123IM">Annie Chun's Udon Soup Noodle Bowl</a> in which you have more of a bowl or meal tray that contains noodles and flavor or sauce packets.  It is in fact a soup cup to which you add water and flavor powder.  I assumed the higher price (vs regular Dr McDougall's soup cups) and the description of 'Entree' meant it would be more like the former, with actual noodles and sauce.  The noodles are much more like ramen noodles.<br /><br />That aside, the flavor is good and I'll continue to eat them now and then, when I'm too tired or busy to cook something, but will probably not reorder.

review/summary: I really like this - add some fresh veggies and ... YUM!
review/text: There are many workdays when I only have a few minutes for lunch or (all too often) dinner. On these days, Dr. McDougall's products are lifesavers! I keep some fresh, washed veggies in my office fridge and can have a great meal ready in 5 minutes. Just microwave this one, for instance, while cutting up some broccoli, peppers, a carrot, and whatever else I have around (I also added half of a slim yellow squash the other day, cut in little "twigs" - delicous!) By the time you're through cutting, you'll have finished with cooking the soup. Take a tablespoon of the broth and a tablespoon of water, add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl, toss the veggies in the liquid, and microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. When through, dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious, healthy meal. The men in my office come snigging around -- several are now also fans, despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan. When I am organized enough to remember to wash and bring it in, I add a spring onion on top (I just use an office scissors to cut it.) If you can afford the calories, a few drops of toasted sesame oil is a nice addition, as well, as is tamari. YUMMY!

review/summary: Danesi + Italian Bean delight
review/text: I have typically used Illy beans in the past for our espresso. Trying out some new machines (Francis Francis, Saeco super-auto, Gaggia Classic semi-auto...) for the home, I decided to play with different beans, grinds and pods too. I have to say these Danesi beans are great! I think I like it better than Illy. Furthermore, Italian Bean delight shipps teh freshest beans ever! Great distributor!

review/summary: Neumans cat food
review/text: My cat has had a delicate stomach. I have tried many different foods and tricks. Since I started feeding him this, he has had no throwing up. I have to feed him more than I did. He doesn't seem to get satisfied as quickly. His sister who has no stomach problems needs larger portions too. they both have no complaints about the taste. This stuff is expensive. It is worth it to not have him throw up all the time.

review/summary: My Kitty Loves This Food
review/text: I know the front label says this food is for senior cats but my sphynx kitten is very active and this is also for active cats, so I figured I'd give it a try. I made a mixture of half Newman's Own Advanced with half of Kitten Chow (for the required kitten essentials!) and my kitty loves it. I like how this is organic and the nibbles are nice and hard to promote healthy teeth. I've also noticed my kitty's poop isn't stinky anymore because this food is of much better quality than the other so-called premium cat foods I've tried before. Tip: If you're feeding your cat a dry food mix and its poop stinks it usually indicates its poor quality - so upgrade. I'm going to continue feeding my kitty the mixture and once he's an adult I may switch over to feeding him just this exclusively.

review/summary: Good for my Cat!
review/text: With all the worries about recalled pet food I wanted something I could trust. I put it on auto-ship which lowers the price a little. My cat goes through one bag in a little more than a month and the whole thing will fit in her feeder (very convenient). She isn't a picky eater like other reviewers cats (although she turns her nose up at canned cat food), but she seems to like it just fine. When I received my first bag I wasn't about to do a taste test, but I did the sniff test. The organic smelled fresh and...well...like cat food, but the new IAMS bag smelled musty and sort of rancid. Shortly after when I was still weaning her off the IAMS cat food, I had an invasion of ants. Both open bags were under the sink in the laundry room and they went for the organic but didn't come near the IAMS. Maybe they know something we don't???

review/summary: Okay cat food but too expensive at Amazon
review/text: I switched to this cat food when it became available at my local supermarket (Publix) for $9 per 3-pound bag.  Compared to others, I thought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVIUYA">Newman's Own Organics Advanced Cat Dry Formula, 3-Pound Bags (Pack of 2)</a> was a little pricey but I didn't mind spending more for an organic cat food. My cat wasn't thrilled with the switch but she eventually took to it but without the relish she had for the others.<br /><br />Now that my cat has adjusted to it and I can get it easily enough at my supermarket, I'll probably stick with Newmans' and purchase it there. But I will definitely NOT buy it at Amazon!  It is way too expensive here which really surprises me.  Even the Subscribe and Save deal is no bargain.<br /><br />So my final words are ~ this is not a bad organic cat food but it is way too overpriced at Amazon.

review/summary: I highly recommend Newman's Own Organics
review/text: It took some time, but I finally got my two cats to like Newman's Own Organics Advanced Cat Dry Formula. My red tabby male had a penchant for upchucking his food and this has put a stop to that. The pellets are small and hard and they seem to love crunching on them. I also mix Newman's Own Organics Advanced Cat Dry Formula with small amounts of other dry cat food as treats for them. This is premium cat food and I love the packaging's very effective zip lock and the graphics to. I highly recommend Newman's Own Organics.

review/summary: So far, so good
review/text: I've had my cat for about 7 years and have had an issue with her vomiting for all 7.  I've tried sensitive stomach foods, indoor cat foods, hard vs. dry food, etc.  However, I've never purchased a pricier food for her.  With her vomiting about once a week now at least, I finally gave in and decided to try this and have been very pleasantly surprised.  First, she's only been eating it for about 2.5 weeks but so far, no vomit.  Second, she loves it and this is a cat that hates catnip, won't drink milk, won't eat soft food anymore and won't eat most other types of food.  The added bonus is that her coat is amazing!  She is so soft now and her coat is shinier than its ever been.  I definitely recommend at least trying this food.  I've stocked up on it!

review/summary: Finally found the perfect cat food.
review/text: After reading other reviews I decided to see if this product could reduce "Sophie's" problem of throwing up her food.  She had been on Science Diet "oral care" for years and seemed to do well on it, except for not being able to keep it down 2-4 times per month. Apparently the problem was indeed the corn products and chemicals in Science Diet and other foods.  This 11 year old Siamese loves the organic Newman's and keeps it down.  Hooray!

review/summary: Newman's Own Organics Advanced Cat Food
review/text: Bless Paul Newman's heart. His services to the Feline Community are immeasurable. With four four-legged family members, health is an important issue. Two of my Kitties had difficulties eating 'ordinary' cat food. Allergies and even apathy ensued and I switched to 'Blue Buffalo' food. That worked for about six month. After this period my Cats wouldn't want to eat this food anymore. (Later I heard they had a recall...)<br />since I feed my rascals Newman's 'Own Organics Advanced Cat Food', the allergy and apathy of my two darlings has receded. Their fur coat is shinier than ever before. My Feline children lost weight and they eat less of the Organics Food, than they did of the 'Franken Cat Food and even Blue Buffalo. For all of those who like to be sure that they give their beloved critters only the best possible food without breaking the bank, I recommend to subscribe to Newman's and thus get it to the same price or even cheaper than the Frankencatfood.<br />Thank You Paul Newman for all You did to humanity and its pets and equally a big Mahalo (Thank You) to Nell Newman for keeping the family business in the spirit of her father. Newman's Own is the best. Period. (No, I don't get money for writing this;)

review/text: All of my six cats love Newman's Own Organic foods. I feed them the dry food and the canned. It's a bit more expensive than the other stuff, but it is organic. That means it doesn't contain any of the 'frankenmeat' that is in other non-organic pet foods. I know that I'm not giving them any of the 4-D meat (dead, diseased, dying, decayed) present in other non-organic pet foods. Google 4-D meats to learn what is in the usual brands. The extra cost is worth it because I don't need to deal with the expense of urinary tract infections and skin problems.

review/summary: Newman's Own makes my cats purr.
review/text: The two rescue cats who adopted me were both about four years old. Both had been surrendered, separately, by their owners and became best pals at the shelter.  When they agreed to come home with me, I began researching the best foods to feed indoor cats.  Books were ordered, articles were researched and we discussed, the cats and I, if I should begin preparing their food myself in order to make sure they got the nutrients they deserved.  I read the labels of almost every dry and canned cat food on the shelves of pet stores and grocery stores.  Then, I found a bag of Newman's Own on the shelf of my local grocery story.  I read the label and found this to be the first and the ONLY cat food whose ingredients matched those recommended by vets and authors. Better still, I could order the food through the Amazon subscription service and have it delivered to my door.  My mature, loving cats are healthy, happy, full of energy, have grown incredible whiskers and we couldn't be more pleased.  The cats experimented with both dry and canned Newman's Own and have settled on a daily combination that seems to work.  They now purr when the package arrives at the door each month -- and they clean their plates every day.  As their caregiver, I'd give Newman's Own cat food -- dry and canned -- the highest marks, and its availabilty spared my refrigerator and freezer from being filled with frozen packages of home-prepared cat food.
