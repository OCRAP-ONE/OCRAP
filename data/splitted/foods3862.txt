review/summary: Slightly different from the other flavors
review/text: I usually buy the Peach flavor and that has the perfect chewiness and sourness... but this Apply one just isn't the same. I even double checked the package/sticker to see if it's the same brand or if it's somehow fake!<br /><br />This one is not as chewy and kind of falls apart in your mouth. It's not horribly brittle, but just not as chewy. There are many different kinds of chew...<br /><br />Soft Chew (gummy bears, Bright Crawlers, sour belts)<br />Sticky Chew (Sour Patch Kids)<br />Rubbery Chew (licorice)<br />Jelly Chew (Fruit Gems)<br /><br />and somehow this one is like a mix of 1/3 Jelly Chew and 1/3 Sticky Chew and 1/3 Soft Chew.<br /><br />And the apple flavor is off... tastes too chemically.

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: I started drinking the blueberry hibiscus tea because I read that hibiscus helps to reduce blood pressure. I have never been a hot tea drinker until about a month ago. It did take me a few cups to get used to the taste. Now, I really enjoy the taste. I even miss it when I skip my nightly cup. I find it also relaxes me before bed. It is sweet enough that there is no need to add honey or other sweetener. The blueberry is an added bonus! I am willing to pay the steep price because I am trying to find something beside prescription medication to help control my out-of-control blood pressure. The price on Amazon is a bit higher than at Whole Foods where I shop.

review/text: This variety pack has a great selection of high quality coffees--regular and decaf, bolder and lighter roasts, some flavored varieties, one tea, and a very tasty hot chocolate. It was the first pack of k-cups I tried. At this point, I regularly order a single type of coffee and drink the same thing every day (my current favorite: Kona Blend [a bold roast] from Coffee People), but that's me. I do like having this variety pack on the shelf so that I can offer a number of choices when I'm serving guests! Whether I buy it on Amazon or on sale--along with a 20% off coupon--at Bed, Bath and Beyond, this pack has typically had the best price for this number of k-cups, so it's a great value for the money.

In SE Penna, and northern Del., sporting some of the best hoagie and sub shops in the country, when those hot little Italian counter girls look across the board at you and say, "You want peppers?," and you nod affirmative, and they respond, "Hot or sweet?," this is what they're talking about.  No sub, especially an Italian, is complete without Wickles' sub sauce.

review/summary: You will only receive six 1.5 ounce boxes total and not 36 boxes as described as of
review/text: December 23, 2011. I would like to add this update to the review below. Interestingly I just called another supplier of died organic fruit sold here on Amazon.com concerning some quality issues for their product and I was told that the problem was that their product was improperly stored at the Amazon.com warehouse. That might explain the mediocre quality of the raisins themselves as I mentioned in my receiver below. Nonetheless. it also appears that the pricing issue for this product still has not been rectified. My original review is below.<br /><br />My one star rating is more of a reflection on the pricing errors and description of this product than the taste or quality of the raisins (they are nothing special though and I would give them 2 or 3 stars out of 5 for taste and quality). As of 11/10/2011 the product description states "California Gourmet, Inc. Organic Raisins (1.5-Ounce), 6-Count Single Serve Packages (Pack of 6)" and that the $13.30 and that the unit price is $0.25 per ounce which therefore indicates a total of 54 ounces (36 1.5 oz. boxes) but in actuality you will only receive 9 ounces (6 1.5 oz. boxes) at a price of $1.48 per ounce and one of the highest prices per ounce for organic raisins here on Amazon.com (there are plenty of others brands available for around $0.35 per ounce but mostly in larger packages although Sun Maid 1.5 oz boxes are currently $0.26 per oz. if you "subscribe and save" Please see this link <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UKJS5E">Sun Maid California Organic Raisins,  1.5-Ounce box  (Pack of 36)</a>). Anyway, I have brought this error to Amazon.com's attention and they indicated they would fix the errors but I thought in would be prudent to write this review in the interim in hopes of preventing anyone else from placing an order based on the unit price or product description thinking that they will receive 36 boxes (would be the best deal here) rather than 6 (one of the worst deals).

review/summary: Cinnamon Scented Kitchen
review/text: Even if you use a mulling spice mix or put mulling spice "tea bags" in your apple cider, it is always more festive when you stir your hot cider or hot chocolate with a cinnamon stick. These cinnamon sticks are also useful when making wassail.<br /><br />Festive Cranberry Pineapple Drink<br /><br />This is a cinnamon spiced non-alcoholic Wassail. The name "wassail" comes from the Norse word "ves heill" and is exclaimed while toasting to good health. At one time, a piece of spiced toast was added to the punch from which the expression of "drinking a toast" arose.<br /><br />1 (64 oz.) jar cranberry juice cocktail<br />3 c. water or more to taste<br />1 (12 oz.) frozen pineapple orange juice concentrate<br />4 cinnamon sticks<br />2 whole cloves<br />Orange slices<br /><br />Measure the cranberry cocktail, water, concentrate, cinnamon sticks and cloves into a 6-quart crockery cooker, heat on low. Serve in tea cups with cinnamon sticks and orange slices.<br /><br />This is a fairly concentrated drink which may be diluted to taste with boiling water. Have a teapot of hot water handy, so your guests can dilute the drink to taste. Fills one 6-quart crockery cooker.<br /><br />R.W. Knudsen has an organic apple juice that is so delicious when heated with cinnamon! It is like drinking an apple pie flavored hot drink.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />P.S. Make a home freshener by putting 1 sliced lemon, 1 sliced orange, 8 cinnamon sticks, 20 cloves and 4 bay leaves in a pot of hot water. Bring to a boil and then let it simmer. Your entire house will be scented with cinnamon and citrus.

review/summary: So useful it's become a staple in my pantry
review/text: I am a big fan of hot sauces and have purchased hundreds of different varieties over the years.  I rotate most of them in and out of my pantry and refrigerator.  There are just a handful that I always have on hand and this is one of them.  It's not really a sauce but instead it is made almost entirely of pureed chipotle (smoked jalapeno) peppers. In addition to the peppers there is vinegar, citric and ascorbic acids.<br /><br />The taste is full, balanced, and fresh.  If I listed all of the ways that I use this product it would probably exceed Amazon's word limit for a review.  Here are just a few:<br /><br />*  Mixed with pureed potatoes for a spicy twice baked potato<br />*  Added to stuffing for chicken or turkey<br />*  A way to spice up a soup or stew<br />*  Used as a rub for brisket or even inserted between the skin of a whole chicken<br />*  Something different in a curry<br /><br />I have several other types of Ca Johns Chili purees and I like all of them, however the Chipolte is my favorite due to it's smokiness.  My only complaint is that the cost is fairly high, however, given the number of chilies that go into one bottle it makes sense.

One of my best-received simple ways to serve it is with some onion-n-chives cream cheese, smoked salmon, and a sprig of fresh parsley or dill.<br /><br />My non-GF friends and family like it so much that it's become a staple around our house, and many of them who don't have GF needs still choose to order them for the taste and texture alone.<br /><br />Perfect cracker!

review/text: The best thing about this canned food is that it mixes easily with my dogs' dry food.  It's moist and meaty and my dogs really like the chicken and beef flavors the best.  Drier canned foods allow my sneaky dogs to cherry pick the canned food without having to eat their kibble!  I think I've outsmarted them--for a change!

review/summary: "Cringe..."
review/text: Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. Ok. While I love Loma Linda/Worthington products I thought perhaps I would give another company a try and ordered the mix pack. I know gluten based veggie meats can be kinda icky but I like the option. We eat vegan at home and we are flexitarians away from home. First can I tried were the breakfast sausage. These are the most edible option they offer. These actually taste good. Then I tried the chicken dinner and the steak dinner and the turkettes and I became disenfranchised with this company's products. The gluten comes out in a watery 'gravy' as they call it which is flavorless and really gross. They could add a thickener and some flavorings but they don't.  The grain meat/gluten product is tasteless and has a very basic texture and is not creative in anyway to conform to the schmeat they are trying to replicate for vegans.<br /><br />Stick with Loma Linda or Worthington, they have some awesome products like ground meat and hotdogs/links that are great for use in everyday cooking. If you are looking for cans of different types of schmeat that all turn out to be the same lumps of brown gluten with no flavor, try Cedar Lake products.

review/summary: Best Tasting Energy Shot
review/text: I got a 24-pack of Apple Slam recently and I've got to say, I was very surprised when I tasted it. Most "energy" shots have that taste like you just chewed some skittles along with an aspirin, but this was actually quite pleasant.  It just tastes like sour apple, nothing else. It had quite a decent kick to it too and it kept me running for about 4 hours.<br /><br />Since we had so many, my roommates and I used these as mixers during a party and we ran out pretty quickly. For ~$1 each, they are much more affordable than any other energy shots and they taste much better too. Cheap, tastes good, and it works. I really can't see any other reason to buy another brand.

review/text: This was a bit of a disappointment. After reading glowing reviews I go some of this and tried it myself. This is a perfect case for why you shouldn't always believe 100% what others say about a product. I found it too sugary ( too sweet) the taste kind of not really there (supposed to be green apple) and it didn't really give me much of a buzz/ energy that I usually get from energy drinks.

review/summary: BUYERS BEWARE! Potentially Hazardous & Harmful Ingredients
review/text: I purchased this product after using Vatika hair oil with great results. I did observe a noticeable difference on my face after just one application. Within 48 hours however I began feeling quite ill. Very severe and excruciatingly painful, deep fleshy lesions began to appear oozing on the back of my neck.<br /><br />In very small print on the container, the last ingredient listed is formaldehyde. Online research reveals that formaldehyde is a known carcinogenic chemical that can cause cancer and severe allergic reactions including deep lesions on the neck. It is very disturbing that the manufacturer would include formaldehyde in a cosmetic formulation marketed as ayurvedic. It is even more disturbing, however, that this ingredient is omitted from the list of ingredients published on the Amazon description. Within 48 hours of discontinuing the product, the lesions stopped propagating, however, it has been over two weeks and the extreme scars from these very serious lesions are healing but remain uncomfortable and pronounced.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE! This product is potentially extremely hazardous and harmful to your health! I can only hope that the severe injury I experienced resulting from formaldehyde exposure was external and not internal. I am relieved to see that Amazon has now suspended sale of this product, however, I have decided to discontinue use of all Vatika products because of the irresponsible lack of integrity in advertising the Vatika Skin Fairness Pack. This was a very painful and seriously alarming consumer experience that I hope others may avoid.

review/summary: Unusual yet very pleasant
review/text: Having recently expanded my tea horizons here lately, I stumbled into toasted rice tea (by another organic company) that I positively fell head over heels in love with and concluded that I can't live the rest of my life without. In addition, the other tea I can't do without is green matcha. So, imagine my surprise when Amazon was selling this little beauty that is a mix of BOTH green matcha and toasted rice. So, I just HAD to give it a shot.<br /><br />I received it very quickly in the mail (thank you!) The tin is beautiful and the perfect size for storage but opening the tin was a bit (very!) difficult as the plastic protective seal was not perforated and sealed very(very!)tightly. It was hard to open even with a knife. I'm sure it was done to further ensure the freshness of product because the tea sealed by yet another interior lid (easy to open, with fingernails) and the actual tea leaves were inside of a foil pouch. Again, no perforation for easy opening and that foil pouch was bound by superglue, so it seemed. The reason I've knocked this tea down by a star --not user friendly.<br /><br />After I overcame these packaging challenges, I had to immediately test it out. The color of the matcha, sencha and rice were a brilliant vibrant green with a earthy, woodsy aroma. A good sign that this tea is high-quality.<br /><br />Immediately, I boiled some fresh water and made a cup for my mother and myself. The directions read to steep @ 165 temp and brew for 1.5 to 2 min. However, I brewed for longer since that was not strong enough. After about 5 minutes and a generous teaspoon of honey...decided to sit down and relax with this tea.<br /><br />The first thing I did was take a deep whiff of this beautiful aroma of earthy toastedness. That alone is worth buying the tea for. Then to actually drink it. WELLL...I'll be honest. It was a bit unusual at first but grew on me very quickly. In the end, it turned out to be a nutty, scrumptious green tea that was very satisfying. My mother could not detect what kind of tea it was, only making the comment that it was "strange but good"  I will be adding this tea to my ever-growing rotation of "favorite" teas.<br /><br />So, the breakdown<br />5 Stars for taste and quality<br />3 Stars for directions on brewing<br />2 Stars for user-friendly packaging

review/summary: Some Unusual Flavors But Heavy on Bananas
review/text: I wanted to try these because the name was catchy, the packaging was bright and colorful and I really like the taste and crunch of freeze dried fruit for snacking. I also purchased this item because it contained a variety of flavors to taste test.  Unfortunately, For a variety pack I didn't find a whole lot of variety. Two of the four flavors were primarily bananas -- Purple Funk (bananas with an acai coating) and Bananamon (bananas with a cinnamon). The flavor I preferred was Jivalime (pineapple and lime). It has a very robust flavor.  The lime is strong and makes it very tart. The Carnival mix was just OK. This was a mixture of banana, pineapple, apple, papaya, and raisins. The pieces were very small in this mix.  I would have preferred  bigger pieces of papaya, apple and pineapple.<br /><br />There are several other freeze-dried fruit mixes that I personally like better - perhaps because they have more traditional flavors. The Crispy Green product line is a favorite of mine and is comparable price-wise to the Funky Monkey products. For great peach flavor try Crispy Green Fruit Snacks, Crispy Peaches, 2.2-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3).  I also like the Crispy Green dried pineapple snack  Crispy Green Fruit Snacks, Crispy Pineapples, 2.2-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3).  With Crispy Green you get 3 individual serving bags inside of a bigger bag. You actually get 9 bags of snacks. The extra packaging really does keep the fruit crispy and great tasting for a long time.<br /><br />Sensible Foods also makes a delicious crispy snack called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYRHL2">Sensible Foods Crunch Dried Snacks, Cherry Berry, 0.75-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a> - great crunch and flavor.  Cherry Berry is my personal favorite but Sensible Foods has several other tasty flavors, too, including a tropical fruit mix.

review/text: I bought and tried the funky monkey snacks and I like them. They are handy to have around, no cutting, no peeling, just eat and go. I don't really care for fruit, so this is an ideal way for me to get my servings of fruit. I do think it is a little expensive, but I think of my health as a priority. These are also very handy if you travel. I took them on my last few flights for snacks. It felt better to eat the fruit snack than my usual chips and candy.<br />Also, these are different than your regular dried fruit, they are airy and crispy. The crunch is great and it's a little snack I can gobble up and feel ZERO guilt about.

review/summary: Funky Monkey = Flippin' Delicious & Nutritious!
review/text: When a girlfriend and fellow mom shared with me and my son these snacks during a playdate, I was curious...my son loves fresh fruit, but I could never get him into dried fruit. Why would these be different? To my surprise these WERE different...Because this fruit CRUNCHES!! The same hardcore crunch just like a chip or a pretzel. He thought it was a treat. And I loved giving it to him. It's 100% Natural, 100% Real Fruit, nothing is added. Amazing! They actually freeze-dry the stuff, which gives it the unique texture and crunch. Plus there are 3 servings of fruit in every bag...perfect for on-the-go parents(sooo much easier than slicing apples or carrying a squished banana in your purse). But what's more is that I loved it! And it helps me meet my daily required intake of 4 servings of fruit per day. I munch on it at the office or in my car. I take it when I travel for work (and we all know how impossible it is to eat healthy and stay on track during business travel). Give it a shot. Purple Funk is my favorite and MangOJ is a close second...but there really isn't a bad flavor in the bunch.<br />Healthy snacking, everyone...

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: My favorites were the Purple Funk (bananas w/acai) and the Bananamon (bananas w/cinnamon). My least favorite was the Carnival Mix because the pieces were all really small and a few times I bit into something hard (I probably wouldn't buy that one ever again). Freeze-dried fruit makes sense because it won't spoil and the fruit doesn't lose any nutrients in the process. If it weren't for the price, I'd order more.

review/summary: Not for me...
review/text: Obviously we all have our own preferences for taste.  Clearly plenty of people have a different preference than I.  I did not like the texture of these at all.  Almost too crunchy for me.  Also, kind of pastey when you chew it up.  The flavor was ok, I like natural foods, so I am totally fine without the sugary sweet fake flavor, but I think the pastiness took away from my enjoyment of the natural flavor of this snack.  I won't be purchasing again, but don't take my word on it, give it a try, plenty of others love it!!

review/summary: Loved by kids and adults
review/text: My 18 month old loves the funky purple and the cinnamon banana ones. The other flavors were okay, but not loved. So we switched to subscriptions of the two flavors mentioned above. As they say on the package, eat them all at one sitting (or at least in one day) as they don't last after you've opened the package. A great way to take bananas on the road!

review/summary: A Fast, Easy, and Tasty Snack
review/text: You know those days you are sitting there wanting a snack but you just don't know what to eat well this has differently filled that void. I was very surprised at the taste of the Funky Monkey snacks due to the fact that I have never had freeze dried fruit before and they were surprisingly tasty. I am also very surprised at all the variety of flavors to choose from. This was a great little snack to also put in my kids lunches for school. Another great thing this helped with is it is just the right size to carry in your purse for if you get the urge to snack on something while shopping, taking your kids to the extra curricular activities while in the car, or while doing homework. Also I am very happy with the price but where I live I will have to order off line because there isn't no store close to my area that carries them.

review/text: Got the variety pack for Christmas, since we are trying to eat healthy.  So many packaged items have added sugar, preservatives & other ingredients.  Recently discovered I have many food allergies, so my meal options are greatly reduced.  These are crunchy, convenient, and taste amazing.  Ordering more -- esp. the pineapple.  As a comparison, I also got some Sensible Foods cherry berry.  Those also taste good, but the pieces are much smaller and harder to eat.

review/text: I absolutely love freeze-dried fruit, but I don't really like these Funky Monkey ones. The bananas are good, but lime pineapple is pretty disgusting. The Carnival one is okay, but I'd really like it if these had berries in them, at least strawberries. Bananas I can eat fresh year-round--other fruits, not so much.

review/text: I got these as samples in the mail. The lime/pineapple (Jivealime) flavor is pretty good. Overall the flavors are a tad sweet, but these are fun snacks which I'll definitely try again. They are 100% fruit.<br /><br />I would rethink the packaging though--it's a bit too loud and plastic-like, certainly doesn't look eco-friendly. But it's a tasty product!

review/text: I try to feed my kids minimally processed food as much as possible -- plain yogurt sweetened at home with honey or jam, chicken breast pieces instead of chopped and formed nuggets, regular oatmeal instead of instant.  But sometimes that just isn't possible -- ever tried to pack a banana in a cooler? That's when Funky Monkey snacks are a good option.  They're easy to toss in a backpack or lunchbox, and they don't get yucky even when we forget about them and they spend a couple days there.  The kids like the bright-colored individual packages and enjoy trying out the different flavors, and I feel good about providing a reasonably healthy snack.

review/text: I have had other freeze dried fruits (like brothers) and wanted to get some for snacks. These sounded more interesting so I bought them. Big mistake. They are disgusting. As soon as you put them in your mouth, they turn to paste and get stuck in your teeth. They are heavily bananas, instead of being a good variety. The package says they are all natural but the flavors on the fruits taste artificial and very acidic. Amazon doesnt take food back so these are all going in the trash

I wish more companies would create sweet fruit snacks without having to unnecessarily add sugar.  I've so far tried the pineapple mango, the bananamon, and the apple cinnamon.  All delicious. I only wish they were for sale in more local supermarkets.

review/text: I bought this 2 pack of Nestle Dark Chocolate cocoa packets for the office.  Unfortunately, even with sugar as ingredient #1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient #2, Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose (a sugar substitute, Splenda equivalent) as a final ingredient. That makes for a nasty, saccharin-y, hypersweet and artificial aftertaste.  Nasty.  Guess I will have to go back to Costco for Milk Chocolate Swiss Miss.  Adios, Nestle.

review/summary: Packaged goods--not so good.
review/text: I LOVE Nestle Rich Hot Cocoa and I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price, but I was really disappointed with the condition of the cans once I got the box they came in opened. Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn't cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product. I just wish the presentation would have been better. Canned foods should NEVER have holes or gashes in them and crushed cans are usually caused from poor packaging.
