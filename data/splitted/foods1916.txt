review/summary: Helps make the protein go down
review/text: I like the flavor of good coffee. I do not bother with coffee that is less than tasty.  Now when it comes to getting protein in, that has been a challenge.  Most protein powders have a terrible taste and smell to them making it less than desireable to drink.  With Click Mocha, I add it to a cup of milk, half cup of water, ice cubes into a blender shaker bottle with a scoop of protein powder (such as EAS or Syntrax Chocolate or vanilla) and one Click scoop of Click - two scoops is a serving.  Shake it up and go, this is my morning routine every single morning. And I do mean every single morning.  I am NOT a breakfast eater, so this helps me get some protein in and lasts me until I'm either ready to eat breakfast or lunch depending on the time.<br /><br />The coffee flavor is not strong in the mocha,  so I do add some instant decaf espresso ( I try to limit my caffine daily, if your not limiting your caffine then add leaded instant espresso) Bustello is my decaf instant espresso of choice and is more economical than Starbucks Decaf Via (Got a box of this for my birthday so I have tried using half a serving and still get AWESOME coffee flavor)<br /><br />If I just want a little afternoon pick up, I will use cold brewed coffee and add some milk and a half a scoop of click to make my iced coffee creamier.  Yes, there are many ways to make click - I prefer mine cold - shaken not stirred!

review/summary: Best coffee drink ever!! With the bonus of added protein!
review/text: I've been using this stuff for months the Mocha and the Vanilla Latte are excellent. I drink mine by adding 1 scoop of each flavor with 16 oz. of vanilla almond milk. OMG! Sooo good!It blends well in a blender bottle. I add a scoop of ice as well and drink it really chilled. Oh yeah, with the added caffiene it's like drinking 2 cups of coffee. I just love it and use it everyday.

review/summary: Love this protein drink!
review/text: This is actually the only protein drink I've tried.  My diet is sorely lacking in protein, and I thought this would be a perfect way to get more... especially since I love iced coffee.  The taste is fabulous, the vitamin & mineral count is good.  After a month of having Click for breakfast, I can really feel a difference in the way my body is functioning.  I would recommend Click to anyone who needs more protein in their diet, and is not worried about the caffeine.

review/summary: Sorry, but I don't agree...
review/text: I have tried many protien drinks, and there are loads that I like - the taste, texture and mixability.  This one was spit out.  I read all the reviews and gave it a try, but I find there is a nasty and bitter taste to it that lingers long after it is gone - much like the taste of artificial sweeteners for me.  I realize that it may just be me - I also can not tolerate the taste of any diet drink for the same reason, so take this review for what it is - my opinion.<br /><br />I also, however, found it very difficult to mix, and found it had a waxy consistency which I found very unpleasant. I did give it several tries - cold, luke warm, hot. Used a blender, a shaker cup, an immersion blender - all with the same taste and consistency results. Sorry to sound so negative, but I did felt the need to share my experience - as it differs so much from the norm!

review/summary: I'm in love!
review/text: I purchased this because of the reviews, the low calorie count per serving, the caffeine, and the protein.  I then decided against it but I couldn't cancel the order (I was a minute too late).  But I am SO GLAD I received the item.<br /><br />The Taste:<br />Imagine a Starbuck's Frappachino with added vitamins.  Yes, there's that vitamin taste, but that's the nature of shakes like this.<br /><br />The Caffeine:<br />I usually eat this with my lunch to give me the added boost I need to make it to my 530pm class and back home.  I tried having it for dinner one night.  Bad idea.  I was up until 3am.  Yes, there's plenty of caffeine in there but I won't drink it after 1pm.<br /><br />The fill-up factor:<br />Fiber is the best filler.  Protein is great with those who have to watch their glycemic level.  I developed gestational diabetes when I was pregnant with my twins and was borderline diabetic at one point.  I NEED protein in high amounts to keep my blood glucose levels at an even keel.  This works.  It staves hunger and has the fiber and protein to help me forget about being hungry for an hour or two.<br /><br />I would recommend this to those who are looking for a way to stave hunger or get caffeine with added vitamins and/or protein.<br /><br />I would also suggest getting a mixer bottle with the wire wisk ball.  Click makes one, but here on Amazon, you find find it a little cheaper (and free shipping if you do it right, either super saver or for Prime members like myself).<br /><br />Again, I highly recommend this and am about to do auto-ship!

review/summary: Tastes too fake/"metallic" is right on...
review/text: One of the 1 star reviews says there is sucralose and hence metallic? i didn't look at ingredients (i guess i will), but i agree that it doesn't have a good after-taste.<br />I really wanted to like this. I bought it, right? but i think it's just "meh". It tastes fake. I made it with milk to make it nice and creamy - consistency is fine; (i blend it in blender with ice).<br />I just finished mine and these few minutes later i still just think "i don't like it!"<br />Sooo... that's great that there are tons of 5 star reviews, but it's definitely not for the taste. :)<br />blech.<br />ETA - i came back after a week. it's not all THAT bad, it's just not as yummy and creamy as i would like. It seems like a large majority of the 5 star reviews are from weight-loss surgery patients? that might influence them b/c i guess they are limited by what they can have?<br />i will confess i actually look forward to my shake now -but i AM on a diet and i look forward to the caffeine also. I stand by the slightly metalic-y aftertaste. It's probably 3.5 stars. I LOVE My source of life energy shake. that's not chocolate though. that's the kind of drink i give FIVE stars!

review/summary: Warning-Highly Addictive!
review/text: First of all, I NEVER write reviews, and nope...I'm not an employee of their company either. But if I'm going to write a review about anything...CLICK is it. If you like coffee, strong coffee like Starbuck Coffee, you'll LOVE CLICK Mocha Double Cappuccino. It's strong, but without the choking bitterness of too strong coffee. CLICK makes a perfect morning wake up, and I've been a "gotta have a pot of coffee to wake-up" person for many years. CLICK is great! Two scoops, stir it around in your cup...zap it in the micro for 1 minute, stir again...another 30 seconds, and all done...simply perfect eye opener. I drink this first, while my pot of coffee is brewing, and within 15 minutes I'm human again. No guilt either, because this has 15 grams of protein and all your vitamins and good stuff to get you going. It's like one of those trendy 1 oz. power shots, but only better because it's also a meal replacement.<br />After buying two canisters at my physician's office for 24.00 apiece, 16.00 per canister (plus free shipping) when you buy from Amazon scheduled shipping, is quite a deal. That averages less than 1.25 per serving, far less expensive than a Starbucks daily, or even a local fast food coffee. That's my justification anyway...and I'm sticking to it :-)<br />Coffee and Chocolate...who could ask for more!<br />~Nonna-Deb

review/summary: My favorite morning drink - OH and it's healthy too
review/text: This stuff is so good that I would drink it even if I wasn't trying to lose weight.<br /><br />I started drinking it 18 months ago and have lost 116 lbs.  True, I have had to do other stuff also, like eat less and work out, to lose the weight, but I start every morning with Click.  It gives me the caffine shot I want and the Protein I need and it is yummy.<br /><br />I know that a few people have said that it was difficult to mix.  I use one of those mixing bottles with the little metal whirly ball in it and it mixes in seconds without any problems.  The final drink is rich and flavorfull and not at all thick.  It has that smooth creamy texture of a mocha latte.<br /><br />I have, on occasion, added sugar free vanilla flavoring, but usually I am in such a hurry that I just mix and drink.  It is the perfect breakfast for someone on a tight schedule.<br /><br />I recommend this to all of my friends and have even handed out samples.  Everyone thinks that a protein shake should taste "proteineee", but believe me, this one is great.<br /><br />[ ... ]

Blend this for about 30 seconds, pour it into my "Starbucks" plastic cup, top off with a little bit of sugar free whip cream and I could swear that this was just purchased from Starbucks, without suffering the ill consequences of fat or in my case, dumping syndrome, since I'm a gastric bypass patient.  Try it you won't regret it, even my husband who never purchases these drinks from Bucks or Dunkin, loves this imitation.  Doesn't hurt that you get added protein and a burst of energy.

review/summary: Holy Click! This stuff is amazing!
review/text: My first shipment arrived today and I am soooo pleased! I mixed mine with 1.5 cups milk and shook it for 60 seconds. Tastes like a chocolate milkshake with a hint of coffee. I drank it down to the last half cup and it was chunky at the bottom. I shook it another minute, still chunky. Added a bit more milk, shook another minute - still chunky. Fortunately the chunks are very tasty. Tomorrow I will try it in the blender and see how that works out. If I don't like it I think I will have to invest in the shaker cup with the mixing ball because I'm sure I will be drinking this every day. I drank it at 11:15 AM and by the time I got to the gym I felt euphoric - definitely enough caffeine for the 1-cuppa-day-kinda-girl that I am. I buzzed through my hour long circuit training class like never before! I didn't start to feel hungry until about 3 PM, ate an apple, then still had enough energy to do a 20 minute zumba class on my wii. Phenomenal!! I have my amazon auto shipment set at once a month, but now that I see that there are only 14 servings in a container I am switching it to every 2 weeks. I never want to run out!

review/summary: For what it is, it's great.
review/text: I'm not expecting my protein drink to actually taste exactly the same as a mocha from the corner cafe. I think that would fall under the category of "unreasonable expectations". But if for some reason, you must supplement your protein intake artificially (as I must), this is a very nice option. I frankly can't begin to understand the complaints here about it being hard to prepare. I add two scoops to about a third of a cup cold, nonfat milk, stir it smooth (just using a spoon, with no problem), fill the rest of the mug with water and nuke it until it's drinking-range hot.<br />Note: Do not heat it to near boiling and then sit it by you to slowly cool as you sip, like you might with a real coffee drink. Too much heat curdles protein, powders, and *yuck!* (I think this is what's been happening to those who complain of its lumpiness, or "boogery" texture.) Just heat up it to the temperature that feels comfortable to drink.<br /><br />I really look forward to my Click every morning, just as I used to with my morning coffee. Now if only it was so dang expensive.

It's not really something I'd drink each day for my protein requirements but more like an additional - instead of my coffee or maybe instead of the local "fourbucks." It's great in a bullet with some ice and tastes just like a frappy type drink. You can also add it to your regular coffee as added protein.<br /><br />I'm happy that I found it. I like the Vanilla more than I like the Mocha and I'm usually a chocolate lover.<br /><br />Great product, worth the money. Great for a splurge and to shake things up.

review/text: Click is a perfect combination of sustainable protein and caffeine!  For years my husband and I have a mid-afternoon protein shake as well as a caffeine "fix" to get us through the day.  With Click we get our protein and caffeine fix in one drink along with the added bonus of other nutrients!  It's VERY easy to mix, no blender necessary, and a great taste...LOVE the new vanilla latte addition!

review/summary: Best Protein Powder: No clumps, No aftertaste
review/text: This is my favorite morning protein supplement! I start everyday with Click. My favorite part is that it is GREAT made with water as directed--unlike other powders that don't have great taste or texture unless mixed with milk. It mixes really well and as long as you stir half-way through heating (as directed) and don't over-heat (scald) the consistency is great. I'll take this anyday over fancy coffee drinks from a coffee shop!

I mix it with cold water and add ice.  I add a little extra water as it is a little too thick and sweet for me mixed as directed. Really tastes like a treat, not a nasty protein shake.

review/summary: The Godfather of Click
review/text: I am THE original drinker of click and what I mean by that is I am a personal friend of Greg Smith (owner) and have been drinking click since he invented it and gave it to me at the gym in a mason jar probably 3 years ago!! This has been a great healthy alternative for a person who was a regular customer at Starbucks every morning, and better yet it is cheaper!!  I crave click every morning over any coffee!!  After my early morning workout it gives me my vitamins, minerals and most important the espresso boost I need to jump start my day. My preferance is to drink it cold, it mixes well in water and if you want some extra protein just add milk, an egg, or my personal favorite is a scoop of muscle milk protein.

review/summary: Too sweet and messy
review/text: The taste: B+<br /><br />This drink is quite tasty. It isn't the best instant coffee drink I've ever had, but close.<br /><br />But it is way too sweet for my taste. I put only one scoop (instead of the recommended two scoops) in a glass of water, and it is still too sweet. But this comes from me who usually drink black coffee, so may be just my personal preference.<br /><br />The fact that this drink uses primarily fructose instead of glucose doesn't help either. The recent studies show that fructose is "more bad" than glucose due to heart disease and diabetes concerns. (I provided a scientific link here, but it was edited out by Amazon. But you can search on the Internet.)<br /><br />Primarily because of the sweetness, this drink is enjoyable at the beginning, but by the time you have had just a few sips, it becomes tiring, as if the only remaining dominating flavor is its sweetness, and there is very little other fragrance left. In contrast, a good espresso or latte drink maintains a strong fragrance all the way.<br /><br />However, it is an energy drink, so it is unfair to compare it with espresso or latte on the taste department. I'm just reviewing on this so readers may have proper expectations.<br /><br />The convenience: C+<br /><br />You shouldn't buy this just for its convenience, which is lacking for this product. It isn't easy to prepare this drink at all. For a hot drink, for example, it takes many steps, including mixing, shaking, microwave, stirring, microwave again, and shaking again. It isn't terribly difficult to do if you really want to have the drink, but frankly, I find it easier to prepare real espresso on my automatic espresso machine.<br /><br />In addition, it can be quite a messy experience to have this drink. Must be because it's a protein drink, the container becomes very dirty and very difficult to clean even if you try to clean it right away.<br /><br />The nutrition: Don't know. Supposedly good.<br /><br />But to be fair, I believe most people buy this product for healthy reasons, not for its sheer taste or convenience. I'm not exactly sure how it performs in the energy department, as I have no trustworthy way to measure, but the nutritional ingredients in this drink would indicate that it is far more nutritious than regular coffee.

review/summary: Cravings for Click
review/text: Click is a fantastic protein drink.  I don't give it five stars because when its made by the directions it really is only mediocre.  But make it with 14oz of skim milk and pour it over ice it is as fantastic as the other reviews rave.  I don't recommend blending it with ice it separates in more powerful blenders and gets a bad tasting froth. I make it every day and would gladly choose Click over other beverage indulgences like hot chocolate or a milk shake, not just because its a healthier choice but because it tastes as good.

review/summary: Confirmed Click-a-holic
review/text: As a recent weight loss surgery patient, I found that my tastes had changed significantly after surgery and I could not use any of the protein supplements suggested by my doctors. I tried a dozen alternatives and found that I could not use any of them and this is a very bad thing for WLS patients. I then tried Click as recommended by the good folks at BTV ([...]) and I was hooked. It tastes great, like a mocha from Starbucks but with only 120 calories per serving. I got 15 grams of protein. I got a buttload of vitamins and minerals as a bonus and I cannot recommend this highly enough. The energy boost works well since I substitute a Click for breakfast. A kick in the pants to get me going, 120 calories and enough protein that I don't get hungry. What's not to love?

review/text: Tried this to have a high protein beverage at work that I could quickly mix and drink when I did not have time for a "real" lunch.  I have tried this hot and cold and the taste is good.  The problem is it does not mix well.  It does OK with a blender or one of those special blender bottles with the interior ball for mixing, but not by just shaking.  It takes too long to get it to mix and even then there are clumps of stuff.  The clumps make it hard to clean up (very sticky on the containers used).  I might as well just heat a can of soup.

review/summary: I can have coffee coolata again!
review/text: When I started dieting and working out I looked for substitutes for all my favorite foods.  Coffee Coolatta from Dunkin Donuts has about 700 calories and 80 grams of sugar, I had to eliminate it from the diet.  Now I put 10 oz of silk milk, 3 scoops of Click Espresso drink, and a pint glass full of crushed ice in the blender and some stevia and voila!  Healthy protein, low sugar iced coffee slushy.<br /><br />I also like adding other vanilla or chocolate protein powders, instant coffee, vanilla extract, or regular coffee.<br /><br />I prefer the vanilla to the mocha, but both taste excellent.

review/text: I absolutely love Click! I have tried several protein drinks, wasted tons of money and were are all gross! I can tolerate two and Click is one of them. It's smooth and the coffee flavor covers up the protein flavor for the most part. I add a little sugar free syrup or a dash of pumpkin spice and a little pumpkin and I have a satisfying drink that wont take 500 calories out of my day. I do use a Magic Bullet to mix mine though, but with that I have never had an issue with mixing it. I have also never tried it warm, so I can't comment on that either. I have been a loyal customer for over a year now and will likely remain so.

review/summary: CLICK Espresso Protein Drink
review/text: A+ ... I have been using CLICK Espresso Protein Drink with PB2 for over a week now.  Before purchasing I had been using another whey protein powder that was NOT very tasty, but none of them ever are, they are just a recovery drink for after I run. So, I was curious to see if this one would be any different as so many were saying.<br /><br />They are right, it has a wonderful strong coffee taste, not bitter, no aftertaste and I had no problems with mixing it in the CLICK shaker that I purchased with this.  I like the size of the CLICK shaker, its small & measures easily ~ my other shaker for the health food store is too big. I'm not sure why others say it doesn't mix well, since I had no problems.  I did try to put it in my coffee to see how it would taste & it was a no go. It did not mix in hot coffee very well, but then again, that's not what it's meant for. I do use room temp bottled water when mixing, as I am a freak of nature & do not care for cold water, but, for the review, I chilled after mixing & it stayed mixed up and maintained it's great flavor. If you add PB2 expected very small "nutty" residue to remain from the PB2 and not from the CLICK. This is not an issue, just worth mentioning.<br /><br />Energy rush is not so prevalent for me, but I can see where someone could be speeded up with this drink, so if you high blood pressure I do not recommend this. I do NOT recommend this for kids or teens because of that fact. I just like the good coffee taste in my protein drink. I do recommend the PB2 for a healthy additive to this protein drink as well.

review/summary: Mix up early, enjoy later
review/text: I'm new to Click, I love it!  I have learned to mix it up about 2 hours earlier, and just let it sit, either on the counter, or in the refrigerator.  You get a smoother drink.  I'm using a shaker with the wire ball.  Second tip, this does have 12g of carbs if you're counting, but the good news is a half-recipe is actually a good size, which is ONE scoopful with ONE cup of water, and then poured over ice.  It's perfect for an afternoon pick-me-up.  It's not necessary to make the 2-scoop version unless you're hungry.  I havent used it in a blender yet, I'm still just pouring over ice, but one day I'll make up a frappe.  You'll be pleased when you see how the dry powder more fully blends with water if you just let it "set a spell."  Of course, you also get twice as many drinks if you train yourself to have a smaller one.

review/text: Until now protein powders have given me a lump in my throat. I've tried and tried to drink them. I've spent hundreds of dollars on canisters of different powders, different flavors, only to give them away to my grown kids.<br /><br />Then I saw an ad for Click. I thought, "Why not. Let's try another one. The kids will drink any protein powder I don't like."<br /><br />When it arrived I mixed one up and realized that this is not your average protein powder. It was smooth and didn't leave that huge lump in my throat. I added a little non-dairy creamer and poured it over ice and was astounded! Wow! What a great glass of iced coffee!<br /><br />The kids don't even get offered a glass, let alone get a canister of this stuff.<br /><br />I like the vanilla even more than the mocha and they now have a decaf version.<br /><br />The bottom line: This protein supplement tastes like a nice coffee and not a protein powder.

I had gastric bypass surgery in Jan. 2011 and Click helps me get some needed fluids in and gives me that little boost of energy. I've always bought it from Amazon via subscribe & Save as they have it $10 less pluss free shipping than I can find it anywhere else, even from Click.  Get that yummy coffee drink without having to deal with the snobby girl who seems insulted that they even have to work, just because you are there to spend money.

review/summary: Ships to APO Addresses
review/text: I agree that this product may cost more from Amazon, but that's not a deal breaker for me.  The reason I buy from here is because my wife has 18 months of a 2 year tour in Afghanistan left to go and Amazon will ship certain food items directly to her APO address.  This is less expensive than me buying cases of the stuff and having to re-wrap and mail via USPS (neither Fedex nor UPS ship to APO addresses).  Even where she is, she has access to a microwave and bottled water, so these make a nice snack for when she has some down time and needs to eat.  Way to go Amazon!  I'm a Desert Storm veteran, and there isn't much better than getting care packages from home.  My wife took care of me when I was overseas.  Now it's my turn.

review/summary: Good ol' Ramen!
review/text: Everyone else seems to be reviewing the shipping of this product, so I'll switch gears and review the product itself. I love it! I grew up eating this stuff and still do so on occasion. My tastes are a little more grown up, though. Now I like to make it with poached eggs and hot sauce. I break the eggs open and let the yolk act as a sauce for the chicken-y noodles. Yum!<br /><br />It's just as good as when I was a kid. Maruchan has done a smart thing by not fixing something that isn't broken. I'm glad that it's stayed more or less the same. I wish the sodium and MSG contents weren't so high, but I suppose there's not really a way around that. To remedy this, I often throw the flavour packet out and season the noodles myself.

review/summary: Great for a quick meal
review/text: A common choice for college students and those on a low budget, this meal is really easy to prepare and cook. It is not something that should be a daily food choice due to its amount of sodium, but is a great meal once in a while when you're pinched for time and need something quick. You can add other stuff to the meal like a fruit or a vegetable to make it a more complete meal, but I like mine with crackers. Yum!

review/text: Though not as famous as Top Ramen, Maruchan Ramen Noodles are still good eats when you're on a budget.  As is usually the case with Ramen soups, the beef flavor is the best, followed by pork, then "oriental" flavor, then chicken.  You can find many different ways to "dummy" it up, but it's best served in a bowl, soaking in those delicious juices.  You can also make a fine spaghetti using these noodles, ketchup, and sliced hot dogs.  Not gourmet to be sure, but still a decent meal.

review/summary: WAY TOO EXPENSIVE
review/text: This is ridiculously expensive for raman. Even at the high-end, over-priced grocery store by my home, these little noodle packs sell for 20 cents a pop, and I find THAT to be too much. Amazon is trying to sell these at 58 cents a pack. I think not. Sure it's just pennies. But if I'm going to spend 20 some dollars, I still want to buy as much as a possibly can. So, really don't buy this. If you really don't care about the cost, save the money and donate what's left to a worth-while cause.

review/text: In Comprison to Maruchan Ramen, Nissin's Top Ramen tastes like crap. My favorite flavor is the beef and then oriental. The Chicken flavor is more popular for kids because its hardely spicey at all when the others have a slight zing to it like medium salsa. When i cook it i like to drain out practically all the water before adding the flavor powder to make the taste stronger and i don't eat it like soup, more like a pasta dish.

review/text: At the time of this review the description states, "Offers less sodium ramen" - less than what, which brand?<br /><br />The sodium content per serving is 830mg and there are TWO servings per packing. That brings us to 1660mg per package - 70% of your daily recommended allowance! A max of 2400mg is recommended.<br /><br />Less sodium?<br /><br />Besides that drawback I like Ramen noodles. They are good every once in a while, but please don't eat these often or think this offering is a low sodium product.

review/text: You can purchase this product at most any grocery store or YallMart for ~$0.25 each, which equates to $9 for this package.  The box weighs next to nothing, so shipping isn't the difference (should be a toss up without the storefront costs), so someone is making a great deal of profit from noodles.  Check the other soup packages with nothing but noodles and soup base, and you will find a similar trend.  Seems common food items are still the domain of brick & mortar stores.

review/text: I am in the process of losing about 20 lbs. I had lost about 6 lbs & I was stuck. I thought-- the same exercise, the same food Im eating from past 1 month is making me hit a plateau. I got this tea from teavana & like the reviewer below suggests, I use a tsp and brew the same thing 3 times a day- 3 cups & I drink it whenever I feel like having some hot beverage (btw I was addicted to coffee & was drinking upto 5 cups everyday, I replaced coffee with this tea) and boy! it jumpstarted my weight loss. My weight has started coming off sooner. Ofcourse I need to follow a strict diet & rigourous exercise. This product is much much safer than those weight loss pills, this is herbal & organic, very safe for your body! I recommend it to anyone who wants to shed lbs. Good luck!

review/summary: Insanely delicious licorice
review/text: First: to review the contents. Kookaburra is an insanely delicious licorice--the flavor can only be compared to dark, dark chocolate. Ordinary domestic licorice you may have eaten in the past is a pale, anise-flavored ersatz shadow compared to this. If you remember how licorice tasted years and years ago, this is it. Kookaburra actually HAS licorice root in it; American licorice uses cheap anise oil and thus has barely any real flavor.  Warning; if you tend to high blood pressure, excessive real licorice can be bad for you--causes water retention. Aside from that I can't think of a reason not to enjoy this treat.<br /><br />My only complain is that the price for 10 oz. is a bit steep. This is one of the best licorice out there, however, and for a real addict of this herbal treat, there is nothing like it.

Other online retailers are selling 16 oz bags, and there's not a lot of difference in price. Also, make sure the retailer isn't trying to make up the difference by gouging you on shipping cost. Next time I'll be more careful.

review/summary: Fantastic Real Licorice From The Land Down Under
review/text: I recently purchased a bag of Kookaburra Black Licorice at Target (of all places) Real licorice lovers in US know how difficult it to find REAL black licorice here, so I was delighted to find this product at a retail store AND at my fave online store. It is &quot;gourmet-priced&quot; candy, but still a reasonably priced treat that's well worth it. It is far, far better than the crud that's passed off as black licorice in this country! (no wonder so many people say they dislike it!)<p>Kookaburra Black Licorice is the real, old-fashioned licorice deal, in HUGE pieces that are perfect for a mid-day licorice fix.<br />Buy a bag for your fellow licorice lovers, or invite a supposed black-licorice hater to try the real deal--they just might change their minds...This would also make a great, inexpensive just-for-the-heck-of-it gift for an elderly person who fondly remembers the taste of REAL licorice.<p>Oh yeah, one little word of warning though: Real licorice can have a mild laxative effect in some people. :)

review/summary: I've had better
review/text: It is very difficult to find really good black licorice.  This is good tasting black licorice, but for me, this isn't the best licorice in the world. <p>Mostly, I didn't care for the texture: chunks of sticky, not very chewy, solid rope.  I was hoping for a texture similar to Red Vines: hollow sticks with a bit of chew-challenge.<p>Once upon a time, my local candy store would get very very fresh licorice sticks in weekly. I am trying to recapture that pleasure, and this wasn't it.

review/summary: The Best Black Licorice!
review/text: I've been eating black licorice since I was a kid and my dad introduced me to the bitter, English variety.  Loved it.  However, I have to say that the Kookabura licorice is even better, and definitely easier on the teeth since it's softer.  As for the latest scare in the health news about black licorice and fluid/electrolyte abnormalities, don't worry.  I'm an M.D. specializing kidney diseases (a Nephrologist), and you would have to eat a grossly large amount of licorice over several days to induce the problematic hypokalemia, metabolic alkylosis, and fluid retention.  People with underlying kidney dysfunction may be more at risk.  The licorice also has to be made of real licorice extract; the licorice-flavored varieties have no effect on the aldosterone receptors of the kidney.  So, enjoy this fantastic licorice, but just don't be a pig about it!

review/summary: strong flavor
review/text: A co-worker offered me a piece a few months ago and I went WOW, I have had many licorice products before but this was something else.  very strong and great flavor, I just wish it did not have so many calories.  The good thing is that you only need a couple pieces to carry you for a while
