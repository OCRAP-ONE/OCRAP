review/summary: If you like a big cup of coffee...
review/text: If you like a big cup of coffee, buy the "extra" and/or "dark" cups.  They contain more coffee for the same approximate price as the non-extra cups (as the packaging is the expense in K-cups).<br /><br />I make 14 ounces of coffee from these Extra-Bold Dark Magic Decaf cups, then add two ounces of milk.  (Of course, if you like strong coffee, you'll need to make the usual 8 ounces.)<br /><br />Note: Be careful when ordering decaf coffee from Amazon: Amazon has a big fat bug in their search algorithm:  If you search for decaf, they will happily serve up regular coffee instead. Make sure before you click the Buy button that you really are buying decaf.  Otherwise, you may be awake for the next 40 days and 40 nights.

review/summary: The Best K-Cup Decaf So Far and I've Tried Many
review/text: What can I say. I've now tried nearly every Extra Bold Decaf K-cup made and this is my favorite. It's a full bodied, rich, complex coffee that tastes "better" than 95% of the leaded coffees I've tried over the years. I set my Keurig to the 10 oz. mug setting, push the button, and enjoy! My second favorite (and very different) coffee is Coffee People Donut Shop Extra Bold Decaf, although I am looking forward to trying Coffee People Extra Bold French Roast.<br /><br />PS. I have to drink decaf only now, but no compromise in taste thanks to this great coffee.

review/summary: Bad after-taste, not bold, tastes awful.
review/text: This coffee has a very bad, bitter after-taste.<br /><br />It's not really bold per se, either.  It's basically a morning blend light roast, but just made too strong.  A bold ought to be a darker roast in my opinion.  This coffee is for people who have lost their sense of taste.<br /><br />I feel bad throwing this coffee out, but once I tasted the Newman's organic decaf (smooth and tasty), I can't go back. The only hope for this coffee is that it will compost.

review/text: For anyone who still thinks that decaf coffee means Sanka crystals, you are missing out on good flavored coffee without the caffeine.  I enjoy drinking several cups of coffee a day, but the caffeine can make me edgy.  So I balance out my regular blend coffees with a decaf like the Green Mountain extra bold.  You still have plenty of robust coffee flavor, but no caffeine.  I highly recommend it.

review/text: Since purchasing our Keurig I have been consistently disappointed in getting a bold cup of decaf (or a bold cup, period!)  This decaf is an exception, and while it's still not up to regular brew standards, it's the best bold decaf I've found yet in a K-cup.  It's a deep, complex taste without being bitter or harsh.  Good coffee!

review/text: I've tried many of the decaf coffees available for the Keurig (not the flavored ones, though) and I've found this to be the best.  It's full bodied, tastes great (and I use the 12 oz water setting so it would be even stronger at 8 oz.) and it doesn't give you the jitters.  I just wish Amazon would offer it on their "Subscribe and Save" program.  It's a tad expensive.

review/summary: Decaf Dark Magic
review/text: This coffee is rich and tastes great!  Served it to friends who do not like "decaf" and they had no idea that this was a decaf.  The flavor is really good.  I took off a star because it is not as aromatic as the Nantucket blends.  To me, a coffee should have a coffee aroma when brewing and therefore making my anticipation greater.  Also, the fragrance of brewing coffee reminds me of my Grandma making (remember this?) perked coffee; and, truly, this is a good thing.

We are so excited just to be able to find our favorite, impossible -to-find coffee at Amazon, and to be able to purchase in quantities larger than the standard 18 ct. box. Even factoring in shipping costs, Amazon's unit price is less than most retail outlets, Walmart included!

This Dark magic Decaf tastes so much like regular that I have to double check my k-cup after I brew just to make sure I put in the decaf.  It is strong, rich and has no weakness or after taste.  I have been searching YEARS for a good decaf. I wasted a lot of money on weak decaf,Starbucks Verona decaf was the closest I came, and this is even better, and it is a k-cup!<br /><br />Bravo Green Mountain, thanks for the great brew.

I just started exploring k-cups since my machine arrived last week. Initially I was surprised how watery the house blends are. I wanted something dark and rich in texture. But so far, I'd rather drink Tully's French Roast extra bold k-cups which is just about as strong as Dark Magic but with a wider spectrum and better finish.

My greatest addiction is chewing Sonic ice by the bag over which I pour all this wonderful coffee. My sister introduced me to this Dark Magic espresso blend for an afternoon pick-me-up while on a visit to Shreveport, La. and I've been in love ever since. Hot or cold it is very smooth and a real treat any time of day,mixed with a little milk,or however you drink yours. Try some. What have you got to lose!!

review/summary: Strong coffee lovers, rejoice!
review/text: This is some of the best decaf coffee I've ever had. Many of the other commonly-available decaf K-Cups are weak or too light a roast for my tastes. This product holds up to plenty of cream and sugar. I've even started making Irish Coffees with it! If you like espresso drinks (even Americanos or straight espresso), this may be the blend for you. Perfect for settling a late-night coffee craving and then going to bed moments later - still tired, with nary a spec of heartburn (as some of us tend to get from caffeinated dark roast blends).<br /><br />The only downside for me is that the jury is still out on the decaffeination process they use in the beans that go into this K-Cup. I'm guessing it is chemically decaffeinated since Green Mountain is not exactly forthcoming with the info (not on their website or on the box). Many K-Cups do use Swiss Water, but I've noticed some K-Cups also note chemical decaffeination on the side of the box now. This is a small price to pay for a great cup of coffee before bed, as far as I'm concerned... and if you're using a Keurig, you probably don't drink too many cups of coffee each day, either (and thus are limiting your exposure to any harmful side effects from the decaffeination process). Still, I would be happy to pay a bit more for a Swiss Water version of this product.

review/text: The Green Mountain Extra Bold Dark Magic decaf is a very good, strong coffee. It does have a slight bite, but then I like that in a coffee. Many decaf coffees have little to no taste, especially using K cups, but this decaf actually tastes like coffee! For those interested, the caffeinated version of the Dark Magic coffee is great too! That is why I ordered the decaf to try. I highly recommend that you give it a try.

review/text: I have been buying the Timothy's Decaf K-cups for a long time now.  I think my taste buds have gotten bored as recently, I drank some Starbucks Via Decaf and was shocked with how much better that was.  I did some searching and decided to try this Extra Bold to see if the Keurig could produce something with more flavor.  It did!  I really like this coffee and will use it as my daily drinker from now until I get bored again.  The bummer is that I bought this last week and it cost me about $12 less than what the price is today!

review/text: I love Tabasco sauce, and I love hot sauce.<br /><br />I expected this chili sauce to be much hotter than it is. It turns out this chili starter is on the "mild" side. But I'm not complaining! Sometimes I don't want it too hot. If I want it to be hotter, I'll just add some Tabasco sauce.<br /><br />What makes this chili starter excel is the the flavorings, absolutely incomparable.<br /><br />Here is my recipe, pretty much based on the recipe on the label. I'm a vegetarian, so bear with me: 1) I take 1 T. of ghee, add a sliced bell pepper and cook for 10 minutes. 2) I add one package of Boca crumbles (a vegetarian version of ground beef), and cook for 10 minutes until browned. 3) I pour in the Tabasco Chili Starter and one small can of V-8 Juice, and 1 can of drained and rinsed canned kidney beans. Simmer for another 10 minutes. Done!<br /><br />For an extra-special treat, I add a heaping tablespoon of sour cream.

review/text: I just picked up a jar of this at our local supermarket. I added approx 1 lb of browned/ground beef and a can of black beans. It looked and smelled good but from the look of it I felt like added a cana of tomato paste & equal amt of water.  I loved the result. I think I do like my chili a little more tomato-y than some people, so you might be just fine w/o the addition of the paste. It was a little spicier than I ususally like, but not over the top, still very good. I served in a bowl with a piece of cornbread on top. Everyone liked it except my youngest daughter, (8yo), will make it again.

It's easy to fill, just twist off the top, and pour.  You don't need a key or tool. Some of the larger generic jelly beans don't dispense all that well, dent or crunch. The smaller ones have no problem, and you get 3-5 at a time.

review/summary: interesting substantial rice
review/text: I just received this so have only made it once, but there is no review here so I thought I'd leave one. First, I always cook rice in the oven where I do not have to worry about it scorching, etc., as on top of the stove. This cooked fine and has more body and substance than is usual in a white rice. More tooth. Personally, I like it, though it is too expensive to replace my other rices on a frequent basis. And I like variety :-) But I will buy it again every few months on into the future. It is somewhat sticky, but that is normal for arborio type rices. It is hard to describe the flavor, and it does actually have flavor which all white rices do not. A soothing wholesome ricey starchiness is the closest I can come. To cook rice in the oven, I use a lidded glass pyrex casserole and cook rice for about 30 minutes at 350F. That is starting in a cold oven. You can vary the temp and time to suit other things in the oven with it. The rice does not seem to care. Can be anything from 250F to 400 F, with the cooking time changing with the temperature. Your oven may vary. :-) Any rice can be cooked this way. Use the same liquid to rice ratio as for stove top cooking.

review/text: I was hoping these would be better than chocolate Twizzlers but they taste like something entirely different.  Maybe its just me and they will appeal to others.  They do not taste like chocolate at least not to to me!  The service was great I got them in 48 hours. Kenny I am sure your other flavors are good - they just do not compare to the name brand or my tastes!

review/summary: Just TERRIBLE!!!
review/text: As someone in his mid-60's ----I have a very fond memory of the original Chocolate Licorice candy of the 50's . The brand..Twizzilers I think  made a<br />good product. That all apparently changed over the years, as the quality & taste became worse. I was going to order some on Amazon because I could NOT find it in ANY<br />stores. After reading all the negative reviews of the current Hershey product ---I decided to take a chance on the ad for Kenny's Choc. Licorice Twists----and spent<br />OVER $8.00 for a ONE lb pkg. It arrived today ---I rushed to open the pkg. and take a chew --------WHICH I ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SPIT OUT!!!! This stuff is BAD BEYOND DESCRIPTION!!!!! The taste & consistency are HORRIBLE!  So sad to see such a great product turn into garbage.

review/summary: Soft and Delicious
review/text: I bought these as a gift for my chocolate-licorice-loving Mom.<br /><br />First, a Twizzler addict she, I wanted something a notch above and this came highly recommended. When I got them they were soft and fresh. Upon opening them they smelled great, and they tasted, in my opinion, better than the name brand.<br /><br />Second, a Chocolate addict me, I never find "chocolate" licorice satisfying, and my Mom who as stated above practically lives on the stuff is herself NOT a chocoholic.<br /><br />So the assessment: if you love chocolate, this is not a chocolate fix for you, but if you love chocolate LICORICE, this is ideal.

review/summary: Awful cheese
review/text: This was the worst cheese I have ever purchased.  It ended up costing over $26.00. The smell was awful. We couldn't stand the smell.  We barely tasted it because of the smell.  It came to us warm. It was a total waste because we threw it away.  I contacted the company about the product, to this day I never received a reply.  Save your money. I purchased it because the beer they make is very good.  They need help with their cheese.  I gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it zero.

review/text: I really, really like this cereal.  There's not a ton of sugar, and it's nicely filling.  The squares stay crunch for quite a long time in the bowl.  The boxes shipped by Amazon were fresh and a long way from their expiration date.  If you haven't had it before, perhaps it is better to try a single box; if you've already had it, you know what it's like.

review/summary: Best Cereal in the History of Ceral
review/text: My key cereal metrics:<br /><br />- Must not rot my teeth with high-fructose corn syrup<br />- Must be healthy without tasting like wood pulp<br />- Must stay crunchy in milk for more than a couple minutes<br />- Must be able to grab a handful and eat as a dry snack<br /><br />This one checks all the boxes.  It's got a great subtle vanilla/almond flavor -- not sugary and not bland.  The only problem I can find is that a 6-pack only lasts a week in our house.

review/summary: Beats Cinnamon Toast Crunch
review/text: Looking for a change, I decided to pick up a box of these. The taste is quite different from what I am used to. The texture is more like the oats style so there is a bit more of a crunch to it than other cereals. The taste feels to have a little less of the sugary aftertaste as Cinnamon Toast Crunch. It also appears to be slightly more healthy but I don't have a box handy to compare. With Subscribe and save, the prices are cheaper than Trader Joes so if you are already a fan, this is the place to get it.

review/summary: Barbara Oats
review/text: After eating these puffed little bite-size oats (original) for so long I fell completely in love with them.<br />In January of this year I found myself in the hospital. I ordered the well known oats in the little yellow box for breakfast. Although I was quite ill, I still wanted my oats. Well, I took one bite and tasted the chemicals that were in that cereal. Not to gross you out but they ALL came right back up.<br />The Barbara's Bakery bite-size oats are THE best and I will continue to eat them.<br />I sure hope they have them in Heaven.<br />Thanks so much for selling them.<br />EW

review/text: The product is as advertised and the quality is un-compromised.  The only issue I had was not knowing that by saying "Sweet Li Hing Mui" I was really getting something with virtually no saltiness to it.  They fine, just not what I was looking for.  I gave it 4 stars because there's nothing wrong with it, it's just that I, like others have commented, wanted something a bit more salty than these.

review/summary: I received two different products!
review/text: I had high hopes for this product. I was looking for sweet "saladitos", which is what they're called in Mexico, and a favorite treat I grew up on. All the ingredients looked right, and when the bags arrived, the plums in the two bags looked different, but i figured maybe one was just older, or maybe a different batch and dried differently, but that they would taste the same in the end. After finishing off the first bag without much appreciation, I moved onto the second and was SO disappointed to find that basically they forgot to salt them. They were too sweet, and that's basically it. All I tasted was sweet and no salt. I haven't really touched that bag and am so upset that I spent a small fortune on it. The ones in the picture are how the first bag looked, the second bag looked moist and dark. I didn't want to go through the trouble to try to return it, so hopefully someone will just see this review and do quality checks before they start sending out unfinished products. SIGH. So much for my pregnancy craving going away.

review/text: I was just shopping Amazon one day and happened to notice the food link and thought I would try to see if they had one of my favorite hard to find snacks. Happily I found Sweet Li Hing Mui and other delicacies  from China. I ordered this and was excited to see if it lived up to my expectations. The order was shipped within days and I received my package bubble wrapped and tasting fresh , I was surprised how fresh it was. I will definitely try ordering again when I need to have my snacks.
