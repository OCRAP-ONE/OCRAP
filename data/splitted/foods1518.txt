review/summary: Love turned to obsession... :-)
review/text: I started out buying one jar of this fabulous stuff...quickly ordered a 3 jar pack almost immediately upon tasting it. This stuff has quickly become one of my very favorite snacks - I like it spread on slices of apple. I have shared a jar with a couple of family members who like it very much. My immediate reaction was LOVE and now I require it just about daily! So on my last order, I signed up for subscribe & save on this. I don't want to run out. It's not as smooth as peanut butter, has a little different consistency...but it's not like chunky peanut either. Just a little grainy, and FABULOUS.

review/summary: Dry, not much fruit, but convenient...
review/text: I used to eat these in high school for breakfast and I loved them. I bought 6 boxes of these to have to eat as a snack and for breakfast on the drive to work. So these are great for that purpose.<br /><br />However, these aren't a quality food product. They are dry, there is very little fruit filling in them, and the bars are very small. Sometimes you take a bite and can't even taste the fruit filling because there is hardly any in there.<br /><br />But, I will probably buy these again just for breakfast and emergencies. Honestly, though, they're not that great.

His eating can be somewhat erratic  and there are times when I don't think he's getting enough to eat and he refuses to eat anything else. Well, I can almost always get him to eat a good cereal bar. I've bee using the Fresh and Easy bars and they're quite good and the boy likes them. Well, this time, they had a small display of Kellogg's Nutri-Grain bars and they were on a deep discount sale. I bought a couple including this blueberry variety. The bars are quite good. Nice and fresh and flavorful. They certainly didn't last long with the boy. They'll do. Nice mix of ingredients too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: The taste is okay, but the caffeine was, for me, intolerable. I had a large cup of Kahlua Mocha at around 10 AM. A short time later, I found myself telling my sister-in-law things she didn't need know. In the afternoon, still hopped up on caffeine, I broke a measuring cup that had survived years of use. When I went to bed at 1 AM, I was wide awake. An hour and a half later, I dosed myself with Nyquil so I could get some sleep.<br /><br />I'm admittedly caffeine sensitive, but one cup of coffee has never hit my so hard for so long - I'm giving it away to a beloved coffee addicted neighbor!

review/text: I am a huge popcorn lover and eat it all the time as a snack. I was looking forward to getting this because I really like hull-less popcorn much better and this just sounded the best. I didn't seem t have much luck making it in the microwave (I use the brown paperbag method). It kept burning or just didn't pop right. The kernels are much too small for snaking for me, but my 2 1/2 year old loves it and the kernels are actually just the perfect size for her little fingers. I went and bought myself a jar of regular kernels from the supermarket and designated that the blue popcorn was for her. She enjoys is much more then I did I think. It does have a wonderful aroma and taste though!

review/text: I am a huge fan of popcorn and eat it at least 3 nights a week.  And I was really looking forward to receiving this popcorn.  And it is good popcorn, but I am disappointed at the size and type of corn.  This is very small kernel corn, which means that it doesn't pop up to the same volume as regular corn.  And because the kernels are smaller, it is almost impossible to use with my air popper (it will actually blow it out of the machine un-popped because it is so light).  And while the taste is good, the price does not justify it.  There is other store bought popcorn that is just as good and a better value.

review/summary: Worth the Price
review/text: This European licorice product is excellent especially as it is "sugar free."  However, one must remember that this is not like the cheap licorice products one may find in their supermarket and that it may contain elements unfamiliar to the average American palate. But, in any event I am thankful that I can purchase this product in quantity without having to travel a distance to a specialty food store for it and at competitive pricing.<br /><br />Gustaf's makes other licorice products, e.g. "Double Salted" which is also an acquired taste as the ammoniate in it is more discernible both taste and in odor for some.<br /><br />I saw one review that complained that the product gave them gastric distress.  Well, licorice is a cathartic and if you get carried away in consuming it, you will have that problem.  As for me, I will probably continue to enjoy Gustaf's products.

review/text: I LOVE LICORICE! I also don't what all the calories and side effects. These are tasty little bits that give me all the taste without the guilt. A whole 7 oz cup keeps me for about 10 days of satisfying "chewiness". Better than weight watchers "fruities". I eat maybe a point a day.

review/text: I was crossing my fingers when these arrived that they wouldn't be like gummy bears.  They weren't.  They are like tuff dots.  Like licorice should be.  I really had to do a double take at the package to make sure they were indeed sugar free.  I just couldn't tell.  I haven't eaten them in great amounts maybe 10 at a time and haven't had any intestinal problems like some other sugar free candy does.  This is my new favorite candy.

review/summary: Yuk
review/text: If you like Licorice, DON'T buy these.  If the manufacturer had spent another nickle on licorice extract this candy might be palatable.  The consistency is fine, like a soft gummy bear.  The flavor is severely lacking.  What flavor there is is almost acrid.  The manufacturer also missed the mark on the nutritional information.  Each package is 7 oz.  The per serving information is listed for a 42 gram serving with no indication as to how many pieces that is.  There is also caution about eating too much will cause you lower tract distress, but again, there is no indication as to how much is too much.  Since there were both positive and negative reviews I thought I'd take a chance.  I did and I lost.  Be forewarned and don't make the same mistake I did.

review/summary: Finally good black sugar free Licorice
review/text: This is the best sugar free black licorice I have found to date. This has a good strong licorice flavor up front with a good salt taste in the back of the flavor. I also did not detect any funky after taste. My only complaint is the delivery system. And that is the only reason for the four stars. I found I needed to put about four of those little bears in my mouth at a time to have a small mouth full. And the problem with that required me to chase them around in my mouth while eating them. They are also not all that soft and chewy. And require pretty good teeth to eat them. But all in all they are very good and I would never hesitate buying them again. And I am very particular! I am still looking for some really good sugar free Red Licorice?

review/text: Gustaf's Sugar Free Licorice Bears fill the need for this diabetic to indulge herself, to reward herself for good nutritional behavior and to fill that need for something sweet which is not overpowering nor hurtful.  One must follow the rules and not overdo it - read the label carefully to make sure you do not indulge in behavior which results in diarrhea!  I do not always chew them - I suck them while they are in my mouth, which yields a much greater and longer satisfaction.  It probably is an acquired taste, but my bears keep me happy!

review/summary: Horrible stuff
review/text: I am a great lover of licorice.  And I don't know what this stuff is, but it ain't licorice. It has a strong ammonia taste, and reminds me more of droppings in a cat's litter box than any sort of candy. I've been told this is just a 'different' sort of licorice, and it's meant to be slightly salty, instead of sweet. But I'm not confusing ammonia with salt. This definitely has a urine odor, and since I've never tasted cat urine, I can only guess this is what it would taste like. Don't waste your money. This might make you ill.

Basically, it's just zero calorie, flavored seltzer, so for those who love the carbonation of seltzer, but none of the nasty high fructose corn syrup, this is what you want and probably already buy at the supermarket.<br /><br />But what makes this so great is the handy 16.9 oz bottle size to bring with you everywhere (as opposed to 2L seltzer bottles), the four-flavor variety pack and the fact that Amazon, at least when I bought this, is selling it cheaply, at about fifty cents a bottle. I'll definitely keep buying this as long as Amazon keeps stocking it and keeps the price reasonable.<br /><br />Flavors included are: Lemon-line, berry, tangerine and natural (unflavored).

review/summary: For people who don't want sweetened (artificially or otherwise) drinks
review/text: If most of what you drink is sugared or full of artificial sweeteners, you probably won't like these, but if you think that stuff is the devil's spawn and largely drink water, this is a nice change. They're flavored but not cloyingly sweet. Make sure to drink them chilled, as they're not very tasty at room temperature.<br /><br />Talking Rain is comparable to Perrier but it's less expensive and there's more flavor variety. The natural is a little bland, so you might want to toss a lemon wedge into your glass.<br /><br />The only downside, IMO, is that these come in plastic bottles (unlike Perrier), though that makes them more convenient for the gym or someplace glass would be frowned upon. I'd also prefer another flavor to the "natural," but that's just a matter of personal taste.

review/summary: Talking Rain Sparkling Water
review/text: The only thing I really liked soft drinks for was the carbonation. But a few sips and they were just too sweet to quench the thirst.  Like drinking a candy bar! And the diet drinks with the fake sugar left odd after-tastes.  So I tried this Talking Rain.  No sweetener, no color, just a hint of flavor.  There's very little taste, so be prepared for that. If I want an ice-cream float, the carbonation provides the fizz and the only sugar I get is from the ice-cream.  I also like the screw-top cap which lets me keep a bottle to go back to in the fridge. If you close it tightly it will keep the fizz for a couple of days.  I keep the case stored in the basement where temperatures stay even.  I wouldn't store it in a garage or any warm place. I also like the fact that it's manufactured in the USA.  Don't want the French or Italian carbonated water.  The same company also puts out a drink called ICE, but I don't care for the more intense flavor.  (Sort of like a fruity Fresca.) So give the clear Talking Rain a try.

I drink seltzer water on a daily basis and have tried a number of brands. While the flavors are comparable in quality with others that I drink, I do prefer slightly more carbonation. The carbonation is sufficient upon opening, but tends to lose its effect by the end of the bottle. I am hopeful that this water will continue to be offered to Amazon Prime customers.

There is a somewhat strong taste from the carbonation, which takes some getting used to if you are expecting the taste of non-carbonated water.  The package had 10 natural, 10 lemon-lime, 5 berry, and 5 tangerine bottles;  I don't know if all the packages have the same flavors.

review/summary: So refreshing and great tasting!
review/text: I am a fan of HiBall Energy Water and wanted a similar natural flavored sparkling water, but without the caffeine.  I decided to try this variety pack and I am very happy with my purchase.  It contains 10 "Natural" (no flavor), 10 Lemon-Lime, 5 Berry and 5 Tangerine (tastes a bit like orange to me.)  I wish the assortment had more Berry and Tangerine as those are my favorites, but they are all quite good.  The flavor is the perfect amount, and there is NO after-taste.  And if you seal the cap tight, it will remain fizzy enough to drink the next day.  Exactly the healthy drink I was looking for!

I've been buying from Costco for years and was so disappointed when I checked our two local Costco stores and couldn't find it.  I'm placing my order today for TWO cases!  I love all the flavors and what I really want is Zero calories plus lots of carbonation! Thanks so much for making this available.

review/summary: Outstanding Taste!
review/text: I have to start this review by saying that I disliked sparkling water until I tasted Talking Rain. It is delicious, refreshing, and doesn't leave an after taste.  Best of all it satisfies my craving for "soda" without the sugar.  It's amazing.  The box contains berry, lime, orange and natural water. They all taste great.  I will definitely buy it again.

review/text: If you have been searching for a refreshing drink that isn't full of sweeteners, chemicals and who knows what else, check out Talking Rain.  It couldn't be any more simple or pure...carbonated mountain spring water and fruit essences from natural oils and extracts.  Amazon's price is competitive with big box stores (if they even carry it) and they deliver to my home free. Enjoy!

review/summary: Fabulous water
review/text: This is great water that has a wonderful light flavor.  The best thing about this water is that there is no salt!  I have been on a low-sodium diet for over 20 years; until I found this water, I was unable to drink carbonated water because all I could taste was the salt.  This is wonderful sparkling water with a very delicate flavor that enhances the taste and does not overwhelm the "water" experience.  I love water - this is the best sparkling water that I have ever tasted.

review/text: Talking Rain is an awesome product.  It's sparkling water with a hint of flavor.  Don't expect this to be sweet or full of artificial flavors - it's all natural.  Think squeezing a lemon into your club soda for degree of flavor.<br /><br />Amazon's price on this is ridiculous.  Over [...]for the 30-pack?????  You can get it at Costco for less than $12.<br /><br />So DO buy Talking Rain....just don't get it here - unless home delivery is worth paying more than twice the price!

review/summary: TalkingRain Sparkling Essence is simply the BEST
review/text: There are many products like this around, but I have found NONE better than TalkingRain!  I first found this product in my local Club store.  They were test marketing it, but never followed through with carrying it.  I contacted the company and begged them to bring it back.  One day while surfing the web, I found it on Amazon.  Best day of my life!  I now have it delivered on a regular basis (free shipping, by the way)!<br /><br />For anyone who loves sparkling water (no calories, no fake sweeteners), TalkingRain is awesome!  I'd buy stock in their company if I could.  Give TalkingRain a try!

review/summary: Tastes bitter like baking soda!!! Blech!!!
review/text: We bought this based on the ratings, and we were sorely disappointed. This was a complete waste of money. It arrived promptly and was packed well. But the first bottle we opened (tangerine) tasted like pure baking soda water - think alka seltzer. So I opened a bottle of a different flavor thinking maybe there was a problem at the bottling facility and the mixture was wrong on the tangerine batch. The second bottle (cherry) was just as bad as the first. Everyone who tried it spit it into the sink and walked around for a few seconds with sour looks on their faces. I will never buy this again and do not recommend it to others. I hope we just got a bad shipment, I can't imagine that so many people would drink this on purpose.

review/text: I thought this was great until I came to the tangerine flavor.  Wow what a disappointment!  It ruined the whole batch.  It tasted like, ...mmm fish oil! The smell was tangerine, but the taste, not so much.  I didn't understand that I had ordered this to come once a month, so now I am getting another 3, yes 3, 30 packs!  I just have to throw out the tangerine.  What a waste of money.  I read some of the other reviews and I guess the tangerine might taste like baking soda.  But I didn't even think it was that good.

review/text: My grocery store stopped carrying my favorite flavored sparkling water so I decided to try TalkingRain Sparkling Essence. None of the flavors tasted natural,left a bad aftertaste & the carbonation was harsh in the mouth. I gave some bottles to a good friend who called me up to say that she was throwing the bottles away because the taste was so awful. Don't waste your money. This ranks as one of the worst sparkling waters I've ever tasted!.

review/text: I bought this water because I'm always looking for 0-calorie flavored water without sugar substitutes.  I tried this water based upon the reviews of other bloggers.  I bought the 28-bottle variety pack with berry, tangerine, lemon lime and natural flavors).  The berry flavor is my favorite.  The water is OK but if I can only purchase it through the Amazon website, I won't be buying more because the shipping and handling cost as much as the water!

review/summary: Essential to True Hawaiian Cuisine
review/text: As any native of the Aloha State will tell you, locals put Li Hing Mui Powder on anything and everything.  This sweet/sour/salty spice packs quite a punch; once you've had it, your mouth will forevermore water at the thought of it.  Literally. This spice goes well with all types of food, though it's at its best on fruit, candy and the rims of margarita glasses.  I highly recommend it with fresh oranges: slice them up and sprinkle some of this on them.  You'll never think of fresh fruit the same way again.

Dipping nectarine slices in the powder is an excellent snack - very tasteful and surprising for first timers.  I have been searching for the powder locally for about 10 years but have not been able to find it.  Believe me, you HAVE TO try Li Hing Mui - it's unlike anything you have ever tasted before in your life.
