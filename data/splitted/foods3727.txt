review/summary: perfect for on the go
review/text: I baby sit my brother's 2 and 3 year old kids occasionally on the weekends and this is the perfect go to snack when we're at the park. Since they're so use to eating indian food and never really had packaged baby food, I was scared to try this on them at first. Surprisingly they really liked it. I usually give this to them with whole wheat crackers or a granola to last them over till their next meal. My brother and sister in law are happy that I'm not giving them junk food!

review/summary: One of my favorite gums EVER
review/text: Trident Layers is an excellent gum for chewing - even the texture is satisfying. I absolutely love the green apple flavor in general, but here it's even more delightful with the addition of subtle pineapple. One of my favorite things about Trident Layers is that each piece looks like candy - kind of like a licorice all sort. I find that chewing Trident Layers satisfies my cravings for candy! Pretty nice around 3-4 pm at work, when I'd like a snack.

review/summary: Slightly sticky gum but nice flavors
review/text: Trident Layers features three layers -- two layers of yellow gum (pineapple flavored) with green gel (green apple flavored) sandwiched in between.  The flavors of this gum go together quite well, with the slightly sour green apple contrasting nciely with the sweeter pineapple.  The gum's flavor does last a long time when compared to the typical sugarless gum, and each stick has fewer than 5 calories.  My only slight complaint is that the apple gel is sticky and gets on one's fingers when removing the gum from the wrapper (with some gel left remaining on the wrapper itself).  Seems like it could be a bit better designed.

review/text: Hi-Chew candy is good. A childhood favorite of many and you get 10 bags of 10 piece of assorted flavors (3 flavors: apple, strawberry, and orange). However you can buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M6HHBE">Morinaga Hi-Chew Fruit Chews Assorted Fruit Flavors (Pack of10)</a>, which has 5 different flavors, for less money and the same quantity. The only reason I choose to buy this rather than the other Hi-Chew option was because I wanted the assorted variety within the bag rather than having to open 1 pack of 10 pieces of the same flavor. I wanted variety without having to open 5 packs of Hi-Chew. Still, in hindsight, I fell like the other option was a better buy. More flavors, less money, same amount of pieces of candy.

Then ordered two cases from here. They're like a cross between Starbursts and Gummy bears. Like Gummy Starbursts....something like that. LOVE THEM! Maybe a lil too much. I may have a problem now.

review/text: I love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEN3GA">Blueberry Brown Sugar</a> variety of Newton Fruit Thins and I love lemony desserts. So I was thrilled to see packages of this new Lemon Crisps variety on my grocery store shelf.<br /><br />They're thin, crispy cookies -- a consistency somewhere between a cookie and a cracker -- satisfying, very lightly sweet, with a fresh lemon aroma and bright flavor. My only quibbles are that the embedded bits of lemon rind are quite dense to bite down on, and the cookie's texture was less crispy than I expected -- slightly more toward a shortbread than the other varieties.<br /><br />I've now tasted four varieties of Newton Fruit Thins. My favorite is Blueberry Brown Sugar (light, crispy, flavorful; 5 stars; I've probably bought two dozen packages), next is these Lemon Crisps. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEJ968">Cranberry Citrus Oats</a> were okay but I bought only once, and I didn't even finish the one package of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEP5VQ">Raspberry Chocolate</a> I tried. I'll definitely buy more Lemon Crisps.

review/text: I love these cookies (what is up with the price on this page??)!  They have a great lemony flavor and a nice crisp texture.  What I do not love about them is that they have little pieces of something (lemon peel, maybe?) that I keep running into, and those things are hard to chew and a total annoyance.  I'd get rid of those pieces or figure out a way to make them softer.  Otherwise, this is my favorite flavor of these that I've tried so far. And that's something, because lemon-flavored sweets are not usually my thing.

I even occasionally just snack on the squares by themselves.<br /><br />These aren't to be confused with the rice cakes you get in the grocery store.  These are the real deal.  And although 7 ounces doesn't sound like much, they are really light, and so one package will make lots of soup.  This is a great find!

review/text: I love cranberry juice and am very picky about which juice I buy.  While living in California, I found the Langers brand and gave it a try.  I loved it!  Some of the other juices seem very bland and mild to me (such as Ocean Spray), while the Langers juice has the right amount of tartness that I enjoy from cranberry juice.  Now that I've moved to Texas, I can't seem to find the Langer's brand in the stores, so I was glad to purchase it online.  The price per bottle here is actually a better deal than what I have previously found at the store.  If you like cranberry juice, I would suggest giving this brand a try - you might be surprised how much better it is than other cranberry cocktail juices!

review/text: You can get the 2.13lb Similac sensitive which makes 60 4oz bottles for HALF this price at warehouse stores. With all the other costs associated with having a baby you shouldn't pay over $40 for something essential to the nourishment of your baby. Unfortunately according to Customer Review guidelines I can't tell you where I buy this formula for less because it could be seen as promotion but I'm just a concerned consumer who shops at a large chain warehouse club store on the west coast. Even with a less than $50 membership it's still less to go to a warehouse store in the long run. GREAT formula though.

review/text: I tried giving this Fish Jerky a chance, but it was just to hard.  It takes about five minutes to chew just a tiny piece.  The only thing near to describing how tough this horrible tasting Jerky is. Have you ever bought the big piece of rawhide bone you get for your dog.  I suggest if you like your teeth and want to avoid jaw pain, "DON'T BUY THIS ITEM"

review/summary: Wonderful Sugar Free Flavoring, Highly Recommended
review/text: The Kahlua Flavor is one of my favorite DaVinci Sugar Free Flavored Syrup types. This was a great find for me since I am a Type 2 diabetic and really have an overpowering sweet tooth.<br /><br />We have tried quite a few of the different brands on the market, but have settled back to DaVinci since the flavors are good and they are sweetened with Splenda. Several of the other brands use Sorbitol (which my wife is slightly allergic to) or Maltitol (which causes me "gastric distress" in large quantities).<br /><br />The real test for anything sugar free is if my kids will use it and they all like the flavor enough to go out of their way for it. We have used this in coffee and in baking with great results.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/summary: A really good way to spice up your diabetic cooking and treats!
review/text: If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product.  We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most.  This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks.  It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes and muffins.  You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories.  The result is surprisingly good and  it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found.  They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!

review/text: It is garage sale time and every week my wife's sisters, mom and sometimes their mother in laws come over to gather to go garage selling.  My wife will throw a box of this Cinnamon Streusel together and we bake muffins for the crew.  Before they hit the road they have coffee and muffins to get the energy for an active day.<br /><br />This is a wonderful mix to make muffins with and it just sets the tone for a great day for the women to have fun.  It is quick and easy to make and it takes only a little bit of time to let everyone know that you are thinking of them.  This is a good treat for your family also.<br /><br />Keep it in mind as something special to do, your friends or family will love it.  I posted the nutrition label for your information.

review/summary: Not Very Good
review/text: My family always loved the Aunt Jemima coffee cake mix, but it is hard to find in stores now.  We decided to try the Martha White mix.  It looks delicious on the box photo, but unfortunately it isn't very good.  The cake part is alright, but nothing special.  It is lacking in flavor-just a bland, plain cake taste that was also very sweet.  The streusel part was very disappointing.  It had an odd flavor that no one in my family could figure out.  I think it is similar to an artificial vanilla flavoring.  Too strong, whatever it is.  It did not taste like cinnamon, which we love.  In fact I could barely taste cinnamon in this cake, even though it looks like it has a lot in it.<br /><br />One person in my family said the cake was okay, the rest of us didn't care for it and won't be buying it again.  We thought the cake was much too sweet and that odd flavor was just strange.  We have ordered the Aunt Jemima mixes from Amazon and are hoping they are still good.

review/summary: Excellent and tasty preserves
review/text: I purchased this a while back from either Home Goods or a speciality store.  What made me purchase this jar of preserves is that the contents were not liquidity like some are.  I also love cherries.  Besides being full-bodied, these Michigan Black Cherry Preserves are delicious and fresh tasting.  They also spread easily as I was using this for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.<br /><br />What is even more impressive is that I got a call from one of the owners of the company when I wrote them about having trouble opening the jar. This fellow Dan (two days before Christmas) called me back within 30 minutes of my sending the email.  The label on the jars from Home Goods (where he thinks I purchased this) don't have the "how to open" instructions on them so I had spent about 15 minutes trying to get the jar open but couldn't.  After he directed me to the FAQ on the website and gave me an idea over the phone of how this opened, I was able to reassemble the wires and opened it within seconds.  It's a French canning jar that opens differently than what we are use to here in America.<br /><br />So not only did I get a great jar of preserves but it came with OUTSTANDING customer service!

review/summary: Fond Childhood Memories
review/text: These are exactly as I remembered, delicious and satisfying.  The gum really does not hold up to current sugar-free gums such as Orbitz, but the candy brings me back to childhood.  The beautiful box art screams 1990s with it's bubble-font and heavy blue, purple and pink.  I ended up getting two boxes of these and they are a great treat.<br /><br />As a warning for those who do not know, these pops will dye your tongue a deep blue.  This can be fun, as long as you're not at the office.<br /><br />Some pops are a bit more tart than others, but the variation increases the enjoyment!<br /><br />Both boxes were sealed and although I saw no visible production or sell-by date, they are completely fresh.  The wrappers on each pop easily remove and do not stick.<br /><br />Overall, I am satisfied.

review/summary: Delicious Jelly (From A Big Fan of Cherries)
review/text: I love cherries, and this is about as close as I can get to putting  cherry pie filling on my toast. :-) The number of whole cherries in the jar complements the amount of jelly perfectly. If you're a fan of cherries, it's worth trying a jar of these preserves next time you're out shopping.<br /><br />For an extra-special treat, put real butter on your toast before you put on the jelly. Delicious!<br /><br />I will definitely be buying this again!

review/summary: The cats (and the dog) are crazy for this stuff!
review/text: I originally bought this for one of our cats as a special treat for an after-bath time bribe (he's a sphynx and so needs a bath about once a week, but is none too thrilled about it!).  He loves all of the Whole Life treats, but the venison seems to be his hands-down favorite.  In fact, he loves this particular kind so much that he'll try to sneak into the pantry to get after the bag!<br /><br />Turns out, though, that the venison is a "family" favorite...now every time I give him a post-bath treat I have to be sure to give some to our other cat AND the dog! It is expensive but it's worth every penny to me (see below) and a bag really does go a long way (I break the chunks of freeze-dried meat into much smaller pieces).<br /><br />I love that it's high quality (human-grade meat) and doesn't have any additives, etc.  Also, it's high protein, low carb and low fat, so I don't feel guilty at all for giving it to our pets.  I now keep a bag or two in the pantry all the time!

It had just the right amount of sweetness to it and had no strange smell or murkiness (which was a concern when I drank Acai Blueberry), and not overly sweet (which I thought was the case for Acai Light). Very pleasant taste!

I like that this is not too thick of a healthy juice drink, but has so much good stuff packed into it. I prefer some of the other flavors over this one. I always drink these cold!

review/text: I recently tried the Zola Acai with Pomegranate juice and thought it was very good.  For a juice that's packed with so much good stuff (antioxidants), it was smooth, not too thick, and not too sweet (although I could have gone for a bit more tangy).  The 12 oz bottle is perfect for taking to work or the gym.  The juice was good in the morning and also as an afternoon pick me up.  I appreciate that it is packed with so many vitamins and minerals and contained no added sweeteners, etc.  super healthy and I would buy it again for sure.

review/text: This organic juice was delicious! The flavor is a perfect combination of berry and pomegranate - not too sweet but not like other "healthy" drinks that you have to choke down. There was, what I would call, a little "pulp" at the end, but I only noticed it from the look not taste (as I am not a fan of pulp). This was a great size for an on-the-go drink. I will buy this again and will be recommending to all my friends! Oh, one last note: in just 8oz (which this drink comes as a 12oz) it has the same amount of "antioxidant power" as five servings of fruits and vegetables! Love that!

review/summary: Not like zweibach
review/text: Well I was hoping that this would be an acceptable substitute for Nabisco Zweiback but it's not. This is not shaped as shown in the picture, it is more like a sliced baguette. The taste is rather bland while Nabisco Zweiback was pleasantly sweet. The texture is much lighter, not as dense and crunchy as Nabisco zweiback. The loosely packed cellophane bags do not protect the rusks from breakage, so I got a whole lot of broken pieces even though there were some air pillow bags in the packing box for filler. So, overall, I am not fond of these rusks and will not order them again. I'll probably use what I have but I'm going to keep trying to find something more like Nabisco Zweiback. If anyone finds a good substitute, let me know. I liked to dip my Nabisco Zweiback in my tea so the product has to be able to stand up to dunking.

review/summary: Great Protein Snack: Less Fat & More Nutritious.
review/text: I've tried all the flavors of the primal soy jerky, and this is my favorite. It has less protein than some of the others ('Hickory' has the most, I think), but still more protein and nutrition for the fat it brings compared to meat jerky (which has much more fat, less calories, and much less nutritional content). My biggest problem with the other Primal jerky is not so much the flavor, as it is the consistency. When you take a bite from the 'Hot & Spicy' you just get that bite. With some of the others (especially 'Hickory' and 'Texas BBQ,' you snap off more than you intended). I also don't like my hands to be sticky if I'm out hiking, on the gun range or somewhere else running water and soap isn't easily available. Some of the more 'juicy' primal jerky make it difficult to take along as a trail or road snack. To me, that's what it should be for--Otherwise I'd just eat real, hydrated food.

If you put it in a ziploc bag and drop it to the ground a few times you will have blocks of all different sizes if the standard block is too big. That is nice too. They are not rock crystal and will break apart with rough handling but not too quickly to be a flaw.
