review/text: I wasn't sure what these pepperoni slices would taste like, (since Bridgford isn't a brand I'm familiar with) but was pleased with the purchase.  Unlike the other review, there was no foul smell upon opening any of the packages.  The taste, right out of the packaging, was great.  Will definitely be ordering these again.

review/text: How convenient it is to have a big stick of pepperoni on hand? Very! Now all I have to do is slice what I want for my pizza, chunk it for a salad or in pasta. It works for everything. Spaghetti sauce gets an extra kick with pepperoni added. I'm still working on things to add it to.

review/text: My family loves homemade pepperoni pizza so this is the perfect item to keep in the pantry! Great flavor. The one thing I like the most is there is NO expiration date, only the fact that you must keep the package refrigerated after opening. So these are shelf stable and buying six packages at once means I will have them on hand when I need them. Will be ordering more!

review/text: I ordered this product and absolutely love it! I will definitely order again and recommend to others. I have been on weight watchers and was really missing my pepperoni when I found this... 12 slices = 2 points :-)<br />I saw a few reviews that said this was not great and I'm here to say that's totally not my opinion. I think that it has even more flavor than regular pepperoni.<br />Has a great spice to it and works great to make a flat bread low point pizza without feeling like your skipping on taste.

review/summary: Different
review/text: I have been preparing pizza at home exclusively for over 20 years and only considered recently to purchase pepperoni in quantity to get a better price. I had tried several brands over the years but this brand has not been offered in my area. After reading other reviews I decided buying 3 pounds was not a big risk.<br />I knew not having a meat slicer was going to be a challenge but I also knew that "practice makes perfect".<br />The flavor is different from what I considered to be the best of pepperoni I had tried, but I have not tried any that may have been considered gourmet quality, and I like it. It is oilier but I don't consider it excessively oily.<br />The bottom line is that if you enjoy preparing pizza from home you should try this Bridgford pepperoni. I have had 2 shipments and both arrived in 3 business days.

review/summary: I hope you like spice.
review/text: This pepperoni is chewy and a bit oily-- good if you're into that. It's also got a surprise in the form of a strong paprika aftertaste that kicks in about 10 seconds after you've eaten a piece (or two, or however many you're going to munch on at that instance). If you're sensitive to spicy food, this probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Each package yields enough pepperoni slices to populate roughly two 12" pizzas (one if you really want to pile on the toppings).

It's good on crackers by itself or with cheese, on hot dogs, in soup & pasta dishes. It is a little drier than other products I've tried. But that is ok, because I don't like peporoni that is too greasy. This product also does not give me heartburn & many of the others do. I like the product! GOOD!!

review/summary: Handy for "Seasoning"
review/text: Off and on over the years I've kept a package of pepperoni in the frig because it's a great "seasoning" product.  You can throw a few into just about any savory dish to add extra flavor.  It works a lot like bacon in that regard, in those instances where you don't need a lot of meat, but a little helps to round out the dish.  You can use these instead of adding flavoring fats too, like butter or olive oil.  It adds variety and broadens your options especially for quick cooking, or when you are out of some of your usual basics and don't feel like running to the store.<br /><br />The problem sometimes is that some brands of pepperoni taste a bit odd - perhaps chemically, or greasy, or papery and bland.  These are good.  I will say that these aren't super-intensely flavored, but to my mind that is good for my purposes.  If you want to get an intensely flavored pepperoni for a particular application or for direct snacking, I figure you want to hit up your local Italian market.<br /><br />I also like the size and thinness of these - they are very thin, which I think is great, because I typically would use these in circumstances where I would want only a few and well distributed in small pieces.  I can use these whole where with some other brands that are cut thicker I'd typically have to cut them up some first.<br /><br />These also taste fresh and have a nice texture.

review/text: Bridford Turkey Pepperoni, it has half the calories as regular pepperoni only 70, regular pepperoni has 140 calories. I found it locally and I have been eating it ever since, I use it when making Pizza and it tastes very good, I like it when it gets crispy in the oven on top of the pizza. I am not an expert in pepperoni, however this low calorie choice does a great job, it doesn't have any after taste or all that grease, maybe because it is made with turkey (less grease, fewer calories) and high quality ingredients. I love low calorie turkey pepperoni! Thank You

review/summary: The slices are, um, greasy
review/text: This review is for the regular sliced pepperoni. The way I use them is to nuke them in the microwave for a couple minutes and it makes a nice spicy pepperoni chip for a low carb diet. Kind of reminds me of thin slices of spicy bacon. Anyway I have done this with lots of different kinds of pepperoni. This pepperoni astonishes me at the quantity of fat that is thrown off during cooking. The grease soaks through several layers of paper towel. People talked about eating them raw and if you did, that would be a lot of fat! No other pepperoni I have tried has generated this quantity of fat during cooking.<br /><br />Now once they have crisped up and you have gotten rid of most of the fat, they are crispy and quite nice. The slices are very thin, so if you go too long they will burn in a flash. I am going to try the thick sliced to see how they work.<br /><br />**UPDATE** tried the thick sliced and they are perfect for my application of pepperoni chips! Way better than the thin sliced. Still amazed by how much orange grease comes off these things during microwaving, but when they are done cooking they are a great consistency and have a nice amount of kick to them. Kind of like spicy bacon. I imagine the thick would be very good on pizza if you don't mind some oil added to your pie.

I like it even more than the smaller sticks you find in some of the old Italian grocery.meat markets, mainly because of the spicy nature. (That's not to discount thos sticks, they're great, too.)<br />I don't just recommend this, I give it to friends as gifts. (Na, I don't wrap them. I just hand half a stick to them and say...

review/summary: UGH.  Read CAREFULLY before PURCHASING!
review/text: I thought I would be purchasing 5 packages of 1.5oz EACH.  Not 1.5 ounces total!  A regular 1oz package costs $3 something, so that's why I thought it was five 1.5oz packages, as that would equal about $15 roughly.  Instead... this was literally 5 tiny packages that equaled a total of 1.5 ounces!!!  Paid $15 for 1.5 ounces, when I could have bought 5 ounces for the same price!<br /><br />However, the wording is every misleading...<br /><br />First, the pricing description states " $15.75 (3.94/oz)", which implies that there should be at least 4 ounces in there.  What the pricing description should correctly state is: "$15.75 (10.50/oz).  As that is how much it really costs per ounce!!!!<br /><br />Secondly, I am well aware of the description listed under PRODUCT FEATURES:<br />  Unit is 5 pouches, and each pouch is 8 grams<br />  1 box of 5(1.5 oz) packets<br /><br />Because the second line states: "1 box of 5 (1.5 oz) packets"... that lead me to assume that each packet was 1.5 ounces.  As this would also be consistent with the pricing and therefore... I made two assumptions: 1) the first line that stated that each package was 8 grams was an error (because that was NOT consistent with both the pricing per ounce and the second line).  And 2) because I had not seen mini individually wrapped packages of these yogurt melts in stores so therefore didn't think that it existed.<br /><br />Other Amazon descriptions for the same product (in the usual 1oz packages) state the same thing but spells it out: "pack of eight 1-ounce pouches". In correctly written English, this is consistent with the second line "1 box of 5 (1.5 oz) packets"!!!! The two lines are written exactly the same, except the measurements are spelled out in one and written as a measurement in the other.  BUT because I received 1 box of 5 packets that totaled 1.5oz... the description should be correctly written as "1 box of 5 packets (1.5oz total).  See... notice that the measurements are placed in a different location-- at the end of the sentence... which drastically changes the meaning of the description.  Take an English class, people!  And a math class, since you incorrectly stated the price per ounce!!!!<br /><br />So, either the seller wrote the description deceptively and Amazon didn't completely review it OR whomever wrote the description and whomever approved of the description are both morons who need to retake both English and Math classes.<br /><br />I am returning this.  WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!  Because this item doesn't qualify for free returns... I HAD BETTER receive a full refund as I was completely duped by the TWO INCORRECT descriptions!!!!  I also don't prefer the tiny individual packaging as that is a waste for the environment.<br /><br />Amazon, please proof-read your descriptions before posting them online!  Thank you!

I love the "snack pack" packaging (although my son seems to think that one package is never enough!) and keep several packs in my bag for on the go. They also are great incentives for motivating good behavior ("Let's go get in the car and you can have your melts!")<br /><br />I love that these have probiotics and are a good source of calcium, without the mess of regular yogurt. They really do melt in your mouth, so they are good for younger babies (as long as they aren't sensitive to dairy) who are working on self-feeding, as well as toddlers like my son. We try to do as much organic as possible, so it is great that these are made with organic yogurt and organic fruit.

review/text: The cans are usually a little banged up, but I don't care. It is important that cooking oil be contained in dark glass or in a can so that sunlight does not spoil the oil. My son can't have other oils, and grapeseed oil at the only store near me that sells it is about $10 for a small bottle, and is packaged in clear glass. Banged up or not, this is a great deal. Grapeseed oil is healthy and is great for high heat cooking. The cans are vulnerable to abuse that the delivery people put them through, but I haven't seen one damaged enough for it to effect the product.

review/summary: Fine Oil
review/text: This Oil is great for those of you that don't like the taste of Olive Oil.  It contains more Omega 3 & 6 and a higher operating cooking range than Olive Oil.  That last Itrm might not mean much to some people.  A higher cooking temperature means the ouside of what is being cooked sears the food and traps the juices in.  Deep fried porkchops are juicier sealing the oil out and the juces in.  A simple oil and vinegar italian salad dressing has no oily tast because Grapeseed oil has no taste.  Try it with your fried eggs.  I can't swallow pills, so fish oil is hard to take if I want to avoid the fishy taste.  I use this oil and get almost as much Omega3 as fish oil.  Cost-wise, this can't be beat.

review/text: Shipping was prompt but the packaging was less than ideal: 2 of the 4 cans arrived dented. So far I've opened one. The pull tabs provided ripped the recessed plastic pour spout right out of the can, splattering me with oil. The spout drips, leaving drops of oil on the flat top of the can to collect dust and grime.<br /><br />The oil itself is fine and the price is a good deal, just the packaging needs a lot of improvement.

review/summary: Like the oil, but dislike the packaging.
review/text: I love using this grapeseed oil in my cooking so far.  However, the tins arrived damaged, due to being loosely packed into the box and allowed to jostle around during shipping. All of the tins had dents in them--some rather major. I'm fortunate I didn't have grapeseed oil leaking out of any of them. I chose to keep the grapeseed oil despite the damaged tins, but I don't think I'll purchase this brand again. I'd be too afraid that the tins would get severely damaged in shipping again. Also, the top of the tin does not have any type of pour spout, so each time I try to pour some oil out, I end up with oil all over the top of the tin. That's a little annoying. I just wish this company would change their packaging!

review/summary: Melitta Manual Coffee Maker
review/text: I was brought up on Melitta drip coffee makers and that's all I've used so you might say I have more than 65 years of experience with these.  We used to take them on vacations because the coffee we made so far out-distanced other available percolated or coffee-maker generated coffee.  My only disappointment is that the purveyor of these for Amazon charges much more money for the set than does the Melitta site on the Internet.  How did that happen?  So far I've always found Amazon to have the best prices for everything I purchased online.

review/summary: phenomenal taste
review/text: I've been brewing coffee manually for many years, using a plastic cone filter holder.  I recently switched to this porcelain filter holder, and it really brings out a huge improvement in the taste. The porcelain conducts the heat better and eliminates any kind of plastic taste. With the cap on, the coffee stays warm for about an hour.<br /><br />Two complaints: the #4 paper filters are a bit too small; you can actually use a #6 filter. Also, there is only one hole in the filter holder, so brewing can be a bit slow sometimes, and when I do try to rush things, there is sometimes clogging which requires my adjusting the filter a bit.<br /><br />But this porcelain filter holder does produce the best coffee I've ever had at home, a coffeehouse, or a restaurant. With coffee, lo-tech and slow-brewed is always the best way to go.

review/summary: A Poor Imitation
review/text: I was delighted when I found this item and ordered it to replace my treasured old Melitta 6-cup porcelain drip pot that had been dropped and broken.  The original pots were made in Germany and had a nicely sculptured shape.  Most important was their uniquely designed spout with its small hole that prevented coffee from dripping down the side of the pot when it was poured.  I don't know whether that spout design is patented and often wondered why its simplicity and effectiveness was never copied.<br /><br />The item that I received from Amazon was a very poor Chinese imitation of the original.  I would have returned it but it is not returnable (buyers beware!).  The shape of the pot is clumsy and thicker than the original.  The spout drips when liquid is poured from it.  Detailing of the filter is less refined and it may not work as well.  Even the box with its ersatz Melitta logo is too small for the pot, lending evidence to my assumption that this pot was made in a factory with poor quality control and under the direction of someone who doesn't understand why people valued the design in the first place.<br /><br />Melitta introduced the pot as an inexpensive item with the apparent marketing strategy of using it to sell its filters.  After they stopped producing it, the originals became collector's items.  The one we broke recently was purchased used by my German aunt from a thrift store in Germany to replace one we had lost in the 1994 Northridge earthquake.<br /><br />I would have been satisfied with a good imitation from Amazon, but the one I received was a waste of money.

(not like a plastic one).<br /><br />The "groves" in the top ARE very slight, and it doesn't matter what kind of paper filter you use...IT CLOGS....Found that a "permanent" filter works a "little" better....But it is still a slow and "pain in the butt" process....Lets face it, when you get up in the morning and want a cup of coffee, you don't want to have to mess with the coffee pot to "coax" it to work.<br /><br />The ceramic pot, if you are lucky enough to get a pot full, does not keep the coffee hot...Its simple.....Put hot coffee into a "cold" ceramic pot, and you have "warm" coffee....So the only option is to pre-heat the pot in hot water first before making the pot.....One royal pain in the butt...And I like MY coffee hot!<br /><br />And lets say that you are lucky enough to get a full pot of coffee, that is hot....its too small for us serious coffee drinkers....Doesn't hold much.<br /><br />WORST product Melitta ever made AND expensive......My wife wanted it so I got it for her as a gift.....Used it for a week, and now it sits in the cupboard gathering dust....Even she says it a piece of junk, and she NEVER admits she made a mistake buying ANYTHING.....But it DOES look nice.....<br /><br />Could have bought a really nice unit for the price I paid for this one....But did I tell you it looked nice?????<br /><br />YES, its that bad....YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED><br /><br />Buy at your own risk......

review/summary: Flawed design
review/text: The design of this product is fatally flawed. Notice on all manual drip coffee makers the ridges on the sides and around the hole. This keeps the filter just far enough away from the filter to let coffee flow. This one has ridges, but they are pathetic. If fact, it would be impossible to create deep enough ridges out of porcelain to do the job. The result is a drip filter that takes FOREVER to flow, to the point of being unusable. You can stick something in the base to break the seal of the filter with the sides, and that helps, but what a pain. I can't believe Melita keeps this thing on the market. They must not test their products. It's very frustrating.

review/summary: Stylish, Healthy, Poor Insulation Job
review/text: The advantages of ceramic or glass over plastic in terms of leeching are well known, and we are still finding out more.  Thus I give this product 3 stars for making really good as well as healthier coffee, and looking stylish doing it.  I have always favored the pour over method with fine grinds for excellent coffee better than any machine, closer to a huge espresso.<br /><br />The drawbacks are this:<br />1) The coffee will not stay hot that long, at all.  This makes it useless for service unless the coffee is poured right away, and less useful for tea too.<br />  (a glass lined Zoji. will keep the coffee super hot, if you won't freak out the coffee<br />  channels over some (gasp) plastic...)<br />2) These things are fragile, careful, especially with the handles.<br />  (I got a vintage #2 lime green ceramic Melitta for a pretty penny, which I use every day.<br />  The handle broke off easily when I dinged it with a knife.)<br />3) Clean it well or may stain.<br /><br />All in all personally this one sits in my cupboard as I usually prefer brewing one cup into a pint glass daily.  It may work well for a small family of morning coffee lovers.  It is too much for 1 person, but it won't work well for get togethers or parties either.<br /><br />PS For the perfect pour over cup, use a fine grind of quality small batch roasted beans, use filtered water that is *just* off boiling and pour slowly in circles around the outside, making sure to get all of the grinds wet.  Yum!

review/summary: Awful
review/text: For starters this lid does not fit.  It is supposed to be held on by two little "bumps" on the edge of the lid but they are not flared out far enough.  The end result is that the lid easily falls off.<br /><br />Further, the quality of the ceramic glaze is terrible.  There are several spots on my piece where the glaze was missed and the raw porcelain shows through.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviewers, the water drips though WAY too fast.  When i make a single cup the water is fully through the cone in less than 30 seconds.  This is far too fast given that coffee should ideally steep in the water for 1.5 to 2 minutes.<br /><br />The handles are also thin and flimsy.  They look like they would easily snap off.  Lastly, this item is made in China so I'm concerned about the lead content of the glaze used.  Given the shoddy overall quality I would not be surprised if they were also careless about what went into the glaze materials.  Do yourself a favor and find something made in Japan.

review/summary: Melitta Porcelain Manual Coffee Maker
review/text: This is the only way to make truly good coffee.  With the ceramic cone, you don't have to worry about boiling water reacting with plastic.  Once a paper filter is placed in the cone, and the coffee grounds placed in the filter, there is just the right rate of water passing through the filter, then through the bottom of the ceramic cone to make delicious, fresh coffee with no residues of old coffee (as in automatic coffee makers), and no reaction with plastic.  I would have preferred a larger volume coffe pot that the cone sits on.  I generally just use the cone over a Nissan thermos, so that the coffee doesn't have a chance to cool down.

review/summary: Just what I wanted
review/text: I didn't read the other reviews before purchasing, and I'm glad I didn't, because the negative ones might have scared me away.  The coffee pot arrived last week, and I'm enjoying it thoroughly so far.<br /><br />When I was a teenager my father bought a plastic Melitta to take on backpacking trips, because it meant he could have real coffee without doing it cowboy coffee style.  He quickly discovered that the coffee he made using this little piece of plastic and a camp stove was better than the coffee coming out of their fancy Braun coffee maker at home, and still uses the little plastic thing to make a single cup in the morning when he gets up if no one else wants some.<br /><br />Recently, our office cancelled our coffee service in order to save money (it was terrible coffee anyway), and replaced it with a Krups machine, allowing us to buy our own K-cups.  I tried several different brands of K-cups, and finally decided I'd rather bring in my own Fair Trade coffee to work and make it myself, and started trying to find something to imitate Dad's plastic Melitta, but maybe not plastic because of the BPAs and such.  So I bought this.<br /><br />The negative reviews appear to break down into three categories:<br /> 1 - Not as good as the ceramic Melitta pot they had 20 years ago.<br /> 2 - Grounds gum up the filter, so it drains slowly.<br /> 3 - Pouring the coffee in manually is annoying, and it doesn't make much coffee.<br /><br />In response to 1, well, they're probably right.  That happens a lot these days.  I'm reviewing the pot I got, and it's pretty good for what I expected.  I imagine if it were still made in Germany, it would cost $120, and perhaps be worth it, but this one works exactly as I expected it.<br /><br />In response to 2, I've never had this problem.  I've been using a coarse ground coffee, which seems to be the main response others have.  The liquid goes right through it at about the speed of any other drip coffee maker.<br /><br />In response to 3, this is the way a Melitta works.  You stand over it with a container of hot water, pouring first around the edges to wet the filter and make it stick to the sides of the cone, then try to keep the grounds soaked without overfilling.  It's not fill and walk away -- you have to stand over for the couple of minutes it takes to brew.  I find this to be a fun and relaxing break in the morning at the office.  If you want something that you can fill and walk away from, find another pot.<br /><br />However, if you're like me and kind of like this method, this is a great pot.  The cone is sturdy and does its job exactly as I expected, working even better than Dad's old plastic cone.  The pot is only as insulated as your average ceramic tea pot, so don't expect any miracles here, but it has a classic northern European style with smooth lines, and I wouldn't hesitate to use it to serve coffee after a nice dinner.  (Since it's sitting on my immensely cluttered desk at work, that's unlikely, but still.)  The lid fits on in exactly like my teapot -- not tightly, just like your average ceramic with a lip to hold it on.  I'm still working out the exact measurements for grounds and hot water, but even with the inexactitude, the coffee from it has tasted bold, full-flavored, and delicious.  I would warn that it doesn't come out scaldingly hot, because there's obviously no heating element to keep the carafe hot, and the transfer process of pouring it in will obviously cool it down, but it means it's the perfect temperature for drinking black right away.  If you like lots of milk in your coffee (or like it at McDonald's-second-degree-burn temperature), you'll probably have to be quicker getting boiling water into the grounds as quickly as possible.<br /><br />So hey, maybe not for everyone, but I love this thing so far.  I think Dad might need a new ceramic cone for his birthday this year, come to think of it...

review/summary: Perfect taste, newer cones inferior
review/text: I have used Melitta porcelain coffee makers since the mid 70s. It indeed makes a perfect cup of coffee. I can relate to the family who took their pot on vacation because no coffee compared...I've done the same! No electric coffee maker compares to the taste...especially in the porcelain pot.  After having broken the handle on my cone, my husband bought me a new set as a gift. Unfortunately it did not drip as well, making brewing a hassle. Then I noticed that the new set was made in China and was bulkier compared to the original German-made product which was significantly finer in both quality and looks.  This was about 8 years ago. Since, I have been using a single cup, plastic Melitta cone. Das Ultimate Brewing Machine will never be the same...unless they have gone back to being German crafted. FYI, when I need to make more than 1 cup, I still use my old broken pot. The newer one having been sold in a garage sale.

review/text: This would make a nice kitchen ornament, but not for $50.<br /><br />I bought this manual drip Melitta because I thought it looked nice and it would make better tasting coffee. It does make good tasting coffee. But, the lid does not fit securely on the pot, you only get 3 real cups of coffee (as measured with a real cooking measuring cup), and you need to fill the filter cone 2 times if you want 3 real cups of coffee. You must wait about 3 minutes before you refill the cone for the second time. OK, so that is about 6 minutes of wasted time attending the brew just waiting for the coffee. The pot does not keep the coffee hot enough for me. I like the coffee to stay hot until I am done with that serving. After brewing is finished I need to microwave the first cup for 30 sec. My next cup would be 40 sec and the last cup 50 sec.

review/summary: Best Coffee Maker Ever
review/text: We bought this little coffee maker when we moved from our stick & brick house into a fifth wheel RV trailer where we travel the country full time.  That was five years ago and we're convinced that this little gadget makes the best coffee possible.  We almost always receive compliments from our guests on the coffee.  And we're not using the expensive stuff, just the house brand from Costco.  A number of the previous reviews have commented that the filter gets plugged and it takes 15 - 20 minutes to pour the water through the coffee.  I had that same problem when we first used it.  Upon close inspection I found that the hole at the bottom of the cone was partially plugged by a solid chunk of ceramic.  I removed this by breaking it out with a finishing nail.  Even then the process was very slow.  I experimented a bit and found that by first folding the bottom of the paper filter on about a 15 degree angle (to keep the filter paper away from the drain hole) and then folding the side of the paper filter along the seam (to hold the bottom fold in place)the time that the water/coffee mix is in the filter cone is greatly reduced.  I have also found that the brown/unbleached filters hold their shape much better during the brewing process, thus keeping the drain hole clear.  We have recommended this coffee pot many times and look forward to many more years of great tasting coffee.

review/summary: Excellent for multiple cups
review/text: Other reviews have detailed the benefits of this coffee maker.  I just wanted to add that the coffee you brew up can be very easily stored.  Just let it cool a bit and then place the carafe in the fridge.  The coffee doesn't come out bitter (probably because it doesn't sit on a hot burner).  I used a french press for a long time but it's now gathering dust thanks to this coffee maker.

review/text: I'm glad I took a chance on this and gave more weight to the more recent positive reviews. The pieces all arrived in tact and in good condition, and they all fit together properly.<br /><br />As one other person mentioned, it helps if you enjoy the process of pouring the water, waiting, and pouring again. I do enjoy the process, but I also really don't think it takes that long. The water starts draining and dripping almost immediately.<br /><br />I've been looking for an alternative to my french press as part of my ongoing efforts to avoid brewing coffee in a machine that is made of either plastic or aluminum. This absolutely fits the bill.

review/summary: Requires lots of futzing
review/text: It's a very good, natural, and healthy way to make good coffee.  But it requires an awful lot of fiddling and futzing.  You have to manually and slowly pour boiled water onto the cone multiple times, waiting what seems like ages for the water to seep through the grounds so you can pour a tiny bit more.  This you have to do over and over, until the water is all poured.  And make sure you don't pour too much or too little, or else you'll get too strong or weak results.<br /><br />I say just take the financial hit and buy yourself a good, automatic, electric drip coffee maker like the Technivorm or Bonavita.  Life's just too short to be standing forever over a porcelain pot, slowly dribbling hot water over grounds into it in hopes it'll all work out.

review/summary: Does not stick to your bedpost overnight
review/text: This is the story of a girl...a girl who went through two sets of braces. A girl who spent most of high school unable to chew bubble gum. Before I got the first set of braces, I was a bubble gum fiend. My favorite Easter candy was that little mini egg carton filled with bubble gum eggs. Still is, to be honest. But after two sets of braces and a TMJ surgery, I was firmly broken of the habit of chewing gum. If I'm offered a piece, I take it, but I don't tend to buy it. But when I do, I buy the bubble gum flavor...is there anything better? It's another one of those flavors I associate with childhood and so this brings up all sorts of good memories, even at first whiff. Bubble gum ice cream, does anyone remember that? The rainbow ice cream filled with little gum pieces...it was two treats in one! Two treats that made two separate royal messes! I also broke my nephew of bubble gum at the age of 3 (he's 13 now). I wasn't thinking and his folks said he could have a gumball, so I gave him one of mine. Filled with Shocktart powder. He won't touch the stuff now, ha! I should feel guilty, but I bet his dentist thanks me for it.<br /><br />Anyway, bubble gum has a very fond place in my heart, and it brings up all kinds of memories. It was another of the new matcha flavors that immediately hopped into my cart and I had to try immediately. And I'm so glad I did. It's definitely the bubble gum ice cream of bubble gum flavors, a rainbow of different tastes and flavors, but under the single heading of bubble gum. Generic bubble gum. Not the teeth-rotting super sugary kind, but the Bazooka Joe kind that loses its flavor too quick. Except this tea doesn't lose any of its flavor. Oh gosh, it's good. My brain keeps trying to make me chew the tea, it tastes so much like bubble gum. I wish I had known about this when I was younger! I keep going back for sip after sip. It's taking definite willpower to put it down long enough to write this review! I want to blow bubbles with it. I get the feeling this would make amazing cupcakes, maybe with cotton candy icing. Yum, yum, yum. Definitely a staple in my cupboard.

review/summary: Prettier than the Picture
review/text: I ordered the Golden Gate Ficus, because I wanted to watch a Bonsai develop which would grow arial roots from its lateral branches. This type of ficus will develop them, given enough humidity. When I recieved the bonsai, i was stunned, because its so much nicer than the photo. The gracefully curved trunk has a deep tan grey color, with creme colored dashes floating thru...striking. So far, only one or two leaves dropped, and that was from rushing thru the unpacking experience. If I could recommend one thing to make your Bonsai purchase successful, it would be to use 2 day shipping. The lack of sunlight is OK for a couple of days, but beyond that its so stressful for the tree. (As well as so stuffy in that box. Trees need to breathe like us.) Trees have enough problems getting used to a new home, besided adding on the stress of a long shipment. As far as leaf drop, or even bonsai death, it's mostly due to either too much watering, or lack of water during the hottest and driest days of summer. It wouldnt hurt to buy a bonsai book, to help you determine exactly HOW much water your particular plant needs. AMAZON has used bonsai books for a penny plus shipping.<br /><br />I'm beyond satisfied by my Brussels Bonsai trees---the craftsmanship in shaping, pruning and pot sellection is obvious. My ficus plant is a work of art; it demands attention the way a perfect sunset does. If you are debating which bonsai to buy, I would say buy the oldest bonsai you can afford, since the first 8-10 years is the time when the tree is shaping and growing its important lateral branches. Bonsai branch placement and pruning is tricky, best left in the hands of a traned specialist. My plant been pruned and wired into the graceful swaying boughs of an adult like tree. (The wires were removed before I got my plant, tho.) I wont have to touch it, except for occasional twig pinching, for years. Along with the excellent Bonsai tree, is an excellent clay pot. Mine has a jade crackel glaze, with dark brisque ware feet. The Bonsai trees for sale at the home supply store are placed in cheap plastic pots. Plus, you cant find the sellection in Bonsai species at local nurseries, unless you buy them here. Thats cos Brussels is the largest Bonsai Nursery in the USA.

review/summary: Very disappointed with customer service from this company
review/text: I received this tree on December 17th.  I was home for delivery (it was sent as a gift) we unwrapped it immediately.  The soil was very moist, almost soaking when I unwrapped it, so I did not water it again.  Some of the leaves were starting to curl and blacken, but I assumed that was from shock.  I emailed Brussels directly over that weekend and phoned them on the 21st.  I have yet to receive a reply from either venue.  The tree itself is now about dead, though we have it in direct sun and have been keeping the soil moist.  Almost every leaf is blackened and curled/dried up.  Very disappointed in their customer call back.

review/summary: Misleading description, but nice plant.
review/text: The first tree I ordered was badly scarred by wires.  The company replaced it quickly with a very nice tree that had a great shape.  The ficus is great if you have little natural light.  My apartment is very dark and the tree did fine off of the artificial light.  That said, this is NOT a tree for beginners.  Ficus are notoriously finicky.  They like regular water and the same light conditions day after day.  Each time you vary the routiine significantly, it will drop all of its leaves.  Moreover, this plant was hard to water.  The pot doesn't have enough room for the water to soak in, so I had to use a spray bottle and lots of patience.  It needs to be watered daily.<br /><br />In short: good choice if you just don't have any good light, bad, bad choice for a first Bonsai or if you are forgetful or travel.

review/summary: Not bad, not great, but not bad.
review/text: This is the first time I've ordered from Brussel's and I have to say I'm a little leary about ordering from them again.  My experience wasn't all bad.  The tree was cheap and came promptly.  Also it appears to be quite healthy and was well packed.  However, while this might be a good starter tree for someone just learning how to keep a bonsai alive, it isn't a good option for someone who is a more developed bonsai enthusiast.<br /><br />First the tree I got is somewhat mishapen.  The trunk is poorly proportioned (being thick on the bottom and the top and narrow in the center).  It is also twisted in an rather unaethestically pleasing manner and has terrible wiring scars.  Also when it arrived it was a little hacked up.  It seemed that someone might have tried to prune it blindfolded.<br /><br />Indeed, the tree is so ugly that next spring I might just cut off the top third of the tree I received try to get it to root and discard the rest.<br /><br />If you're in for a big project and want to start a new tree for cheap, this is definitely an option.  Howevever, one shouldn't expect to get a tree that's ready to grow into a prize winning bonsai without a whole heap of TLC for less than $30.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised. Still alive and looking great!
review/text: I didn't really expect this tree to last long.  I gave it to my boyfriend as a gift because he wanted to try his hand at his first bonsai tree.  I figured he'd have it for a little while, have some fun with it, and then it would die.  No big deal since it wasn't very expensive.  Luckily, I've been pleasantly surprised.  He's had the tree for over 3 months now and it's looking great.  He definitely takes care of it (waters it regularly, trims it, and turns it so it gets even sun) but he doesn't put a lot of time into it.  It's very low maintenance and looks great.  I'm thinking about getting one for myself.  It came very well packaged.  The tree had a good shape to it when it arrived and was healthy.  I'd definitely recommend this as a great little starter bonsai (even for people like us who know nothing about plants and bonsai trees).<br /><br />Update: It's been over a year since I got this tree and it's still doing great.  It continues to get new growth and he's been able to train some branches to grow in different directions and change the shape of the tree.  We don't know much about plants but it's been easy to keep this tree alive and enjoy it.

They had the roots wrapped in plastic and the soil was nice and moist. I LOVED the ceramic pot it came in. Beautiful. I couldn't be more pleased. The shape of the tree is also amazing. It is very twisted, unique, and beautiful. Everyone compliments my new tree!<br /><br />I have set it up with a plant light bulb in a desk lamp and set it in a humidity tray. Its just a tray with rocks for decoration and water poured over them so that as the water evaporates it gives my tree some humidity in this dry house. I look forward to many years with my new tree.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />I bought another one for my mom for mother's day and it was fantastic! She was so happy with it!  I noticed a fungus gnat flying around it, which hopefully won't turn into a problem.<br /><br />EDIT: it is over a year later and these trees are still alive.

review/summary: It's perfect!
review/text: I don't normally give a review on the condition of an item as it arrives from shipping much less one I gave as a gift, but I simply must pass this on.<br /><br />I bought the ficus from Brussel's Bonsai.  It being a tree, I wondered if the tree would make it to my mom in one piece.  Well, my mom called me today.  She just got the tree and she is thrilled beyond belief.  She said it arrived in absolutely perfect condition, as if someone had hand delivered it.  She still can't get over how it was possible.  She said it arrived in a huge box, but it was just a little tree and it looked perfect.  They had packed it so well.  I told her to send it back if there's anything wrong with it, but she said no, it is PERFECT.  Knowing my mom, she would have told me if it wasn't.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I've had three trees sent as gifts to family and they have been an absolute hit!  Usually, I get a nice, polite thank you; but this time it is call after call from people who are at a loss for words, just like my mom.  Rarely does a present garner so much positive feedback.  Thank you, Amazon!

review/summary: Lovely plant Speedy Service
review/text: I sent this as a gift, and it arrived with lightening speed, in perfect condition.  The only negative was that my recipient mentioned there was no tray under the plant,and usually plants come on a decent little tray.  A detail, but you need to know when ordering. Otherwise we both very happy with the plant.  I would definitely order more plants from Amazon again.

review/summary: Golden gate ficus indoor bonsai tree
review/text: I ordered this tree, on November 29, 2006, it was delivered December 5, 2006.  It was frozen when it was delivered, needless to say, it now looks dead.  The box said 2 day air, but it wasn't.  I'm very disappointed with this item.  Was supposed to be a gift. but now it's dead.  Becareful of ording plants in the winter time.  I live in Michigan.  It must have set in the UPS office for a few days in a freezer or something.

review/summary: Good little tree.
review/text: Tree arrived shrink-wrapped and strapped to the bottom of a large box filled with packing (very impressive packing).  The tree was healthy and the soil was still moist, if anything it had too much soil.  I took a fork and scooped out a good bit of soil so as not to have a huge mound around the trunk of the tree.<br /><br />The picture shows a blue tray, but mine was brown, but for me that worked better with my office's color scheme.  I added some baby tears to the soil as a ground cover and to keep the soil wetter.<br /><br />I didn't notice any leaves dropping like others have reported, don't believe the reviews that are two years old, maybe the trees were poor quality back then but the one I got is great.

review/summary: What's going on???
review/text: This is the second ficus I ordered from Brussel. The first one, almost a year ago is doing great and a beautiful tree. So I thought I need one for my office and ordered this one. The tree came, and my excitement and anticipation died a quick dead. This one is much smaller than the last one, has no branches and looked like a few leaves sprouted out of some roots. Very weird looking, only about 4" total height, with a very small rectangular pot. Yes, no resemblance to the picture in Amazon.<br /><br />Thought I need to mention that this is the first time Brussel disappointed me. OK..Brussel, don't make me think that ordering from you guys is like getting a box of chocolate, you don't know what you get until you open it up..

review/text: I purchased as a gift and so far so good.  The plant went though a period of adjustment and lost some leaves but has rebounded now that it's acclamated to it's new home.  The enclosed brochure isn't worth the paper it's printed on as far as help.  I recommend you get a good book or talk to someone who has bonsai for help.

review/summary: Brown Leaves
review/text: I read all of the positives reviews before placing an order for thie Bonsai and was optomistic about having this shipped to someone in CA since there shouldnt be any issues with cold weather or snow.  The plant was packaged great! and I watched over Skype him opening the box up only to see that 99% of the leaves were dark brown in color.  The package indicated that its normal to see about 20% of the leaves to fall however within 2 days they were all falling off.  I have since returned this plant and chose a different style.

review/summary: Had some troubles..
review/text: I bought this tree about 2.5 weeks ago. It was freezing temperatures when I received the plant, and the heating pack included in the box had already been spent. I suspect the cold killed my first tree, because 75% of the leaves were brown and dropped. The branches I discovered after 2 weeks of caring for the plant were dead too. I put in for an exchange on Wednesday and now have my new plant Friday. The new plant is larger, fuller, and has a better curve to the trunk. It was not that much of a hassle to send back the plant, I kept the box and put it back in there. Shipping was free both for the return and the new plant was free. They upgraded me from 2 day (I'm a prime member) to 1 day shipping on the new tree sent. Overall it was probably the weather's fault for the dead tree. The new one is awesome, and looks great. No brown or even yellow leaves. I would highly recommend this product (amazon has a later return date than ordering straight form Brussel's nursery) as long as you (given where you live) either pick the right time of year to order, or get 1 day shipping.

review/text: This was going to be a Christmas gift.I opened this package as soon as I got it. The leaves on the tree were all brown. Not one note on caring for the tree.  It was really sad to see such a sick tree. I would love to try to nurse it back to health but I don't want to gamble my money away if I can't.  I will be shipping this back today.  I tried to call them but they said I had to go thru Amazon for any questions or returns and they wouldn't speak with me.

review/summary: Cute and Sturdy
review/text: I received two of these little trees as a birthday gift. Because I wasn't expecting them and because the UPS guy failed to leave a proper notice on my door, the poor things sat in the box for an extra three days until the security guard in my building informed me I had a delivery. The plants were well-packed and still in perfect condition. One month later they are thriving and doing beautifully in my windowsill.<br /><br />Edit (8/21/09): My two trees are 9 months old and still doing well, sitting in my windowsill in sunny Los Angeles. I water them every other day with the exception of the one time it completely slipped my mind for almost a week in the height of summer. Nearly all of the leaves on one of my plants had withered and died, and just over half on the other plant. I figured they were goners, but after plucking all the dead leaves and resuming a constant watering schedule, the leaves came back just as green, plentiful and even fatter than before.

review/summary: Doesn't look like the same type of ficus in the picture...
review/text: A good price on this tree.  But I was disappointed when it arrived.  The trunk was awful--it was very bulbous/tuberous, and huge compared to the leaf portion.  Just ugly.  I called Brussel's directly and explained that I wasn't sure I had even received the same type of ficus I ordered.  They promised to call me back, but didn't.  I called Amazon, and they quickly placed an order for a replacement.  I e-mailed Brussel's to let them know to expect a replacement order, and explained about the first plant.  Didn't get a response, but the replacement plant was much the same.  The roots/trunk were less bulbous and more compatible with the overall size of the tree.  It wasn't quite as unattractive, but still didn't look like the same tree as displayed in the picture.
