review/summary: Delicioso!
review/text: I originally bought these for myself to relive the nostalgia of consuming one of my favorite snacks of the 90's (R.I.P. Randy Savage). Little did I know how fast the box would run out, these are a huge hit when we have friends and family over. Each jerky stick is roughly a bite size version of the huge sticks you see at your local kwik-e-mart, and 100 sounds like a lot but it isn't - I find myself having to buy these nearly once a month.

review/summary: Fresh, convenient, easy to store
review/text: Having never ordered food online before, I was a little leery. However, I decided to take the leap as my husband's birthday was approaching and Slim Jim's are one of his favorites. The cost was no more than buying at a brick and mortar store and the product arrived with excellent freshness. The handy box they come in make for neat storage in the pantry. Not a downside to be had! I would definitely buy again.

review/summary: It'll Do
review/text: I was so disappointed when I realized that my local Cambodian market stopped carrying DeDe brand and substituted it with this one.  This brand doesn't have the intense flavor or creaminess of Thai tea and isn't nearly as good as DeDe.  It will suffice to stave a craving, but if you have a choice, go for DeDe.  This brand is thin and doesn't have a very authentic flavor.

review/text: I absolutely love the thai tea I find in restaurants so I went on a search (before the internet had everything for sale) to find the leaves/mixes so I could make my own at home.  This was all I came across but it left me sorely disappointed.  I love the intense flavor of the tea and this mix gives me none of it.  Even worse, there's no way for me to make it stronger! All and all it's a tasty drink, but it is NOT the tea you're accustomed to in restaurants.  I like my tea strong and I can't drink this at all.

I'd give it four stars just on my own, but the wife loves it and gives it the other star.<br /><br />Had dificulty finding it locally on a regular basis, and turned to an online purchase.<br /><br />Very happy with the online purchase, as well. I now buy a large amount at a time to keep our supply on hand as it stores extremely well, with each packet individually wrapped.<br /><br />We find it especially good for traveling, as we have a convenient and familiar comfort drink that we can count on anywhere we can get hot water.<br /><br />The friends and family we have introduced to this product have mostly been very positive in their responses to it, and several have mentioned buying their own afterwards.

review/text: I did not buy this product off Amazon, I bought it at my local H Mart (although I had first found out about this brand on Amazon). I bought it to try it out and I love it. Given it is not healthy, it tastes exactly as how you would order in a Thai restaurant. I have not tried it hot, but I brew it hot, then place it in the fridge. My measurements were 1 cup per packet. Just measure out how many cups you want, boil that in a measuring cup in the microwave, add in the packets and place in the fridge. Wait until cooled to serve. It does not need any cream or sugar. It is sweet enough as it is! Perfect! Wish I could buy this in bulk it is so good! Now I don't have to wait until I go out for Thai tea!

review/text: The product description is a bit confusing because an American praline carmelly with nuts and is very different than a European one. The picture and the words didn't quite make sense BUT I took a leap of faith. Wasn't sure IF chocolate covered cherries alone and/or wafers would be part of the purchase.<br /><br />This yummy elegant treat is milk chocolate shell filled with a cherry bathed in creamy Cherry Liqueur wrapped in gold. There are 9 to each box which is considered 3 servings. These are NOT your granny's chocolate covered cherries though, there's a slight alcohol kick. This is a product of Hungary which is sold world-wide based on the many languages on the flip-side of the individual box.

review/summary: I got bait and switched
review/text: When I ordered this product, it said it was real cinnamon (i.e."canela") and "product of Sri Lanka". I ordered based on that, but they sent me Indonesian "cinnamon" (not Canela). Not at all what I wanted, and this item has been deemed "not eligible for return", and the website has been revised to match what they sent me.<br /><br />I don't think they did it to be evil, but they should have admitted they no longer stock what I ordered instead of taking my money for something I did not want. This product is WAY too expensive for common non-canela "cinnamon", so I feel a bit ripped-off.  And now I still have to find some real canela. Two stars, because it's probably an overpriced yet adequate product if you weren't bait-and-switched from something else. For me, it was just a total waste of time and money. :(

review/text: I used to buy the San Gennaro polenta rolls at my local grocery store, but they stopped carrying it a couple years ago. I haven't found it anywhere locally, so I decided to buy them online.<br /><br />I like that it doesn't have to be refrigerated before opening, that it keeps for a long time, and it's ready to go to be the carrier for whatever sauce you want. I usually use this recipe[...], with more wine and less chicken broth, and baked. Great vegetarian meal, also good with crumbled hot sausage in the sauce. One of these days I'll have to try one of the frying recipes too.

review/summary: Tuscan Oil at Its Finest, but....
review/text: Badia a Coltibuono olive oil is a legend, deservedly so. But be forewarned -- if you are used to the bland olive oils sold mass market in most supermarkets, the strong assertive character may come as somewhat of a shock. As noted in the Amazon product description, "according to Deborah Krasner in "The Flavors of Olive Oil", this oil "...is strongly and pleasantly bitter, with a pronounced burn....'It made my face scrunch up.' Very green and grassy, this is an oil made for drizzling.""  I would tend to agree with that. In my opinion, this is really at it's best drizzled over grilled meats, vegetables and salads almost as a condiment. For dipping bread and most cooking (it's too expensive for most chefs on a budget like mine anyway) you might prefer an oil from Sicily, Spain, Australia or California, which are softer and more buttery. That said, for purists, this may be the right olive oil even for bread dipping. It's flavors and aromas are remarkably complex and powerful.

review/summary: Pro Plan Roasted Chicken Slices!  Great!
review/text: The Pro Plan Chicken Slices are great!  I was trying to replace other types of dry chicken tender-type treats (Waggon Train), which it turns out were made in China, and I found these, which I verified are Made in the USA.  The only part of this product that is imported are the nutrients, according to the company, but the chicken is from the US and the Lamb is from New Zealand.  The company can't source the nutrients (vitamins) in the the quantity needed here, so they import them and test them, but the product is then manufactured here in the US.<br /><br />The representative on the phone told me that most of their treats are made in the US, a couple are manufactured in Canada, and that one treat she thought was manufactured in Columbia.  I asked why the label on the product just says distributed by Nestle Purina Petcare company in St. Louis, MO, and that the label doesn't say manufactured or "Made in the USA," and she stated that the FDA doesn't require that a label state "Made in the USA," if it is made here.  The FDA requires that if a product is made in another country, that the name of that country be stated.  I told her it would probably help the company, and consumers, if they would actually state "Made in the USA" on the label.<br /><br />At any rate, my dogs love these.  I have subscribed for delivery on this product, which lowers the price a bit, and also saves me the time and money of having to go to Petsmart to purchase them.  That way, I always have them in the house.  I go through about a bag every two weeks for my two dogs, a Sheltie and a Chihuahua.  Hope this info helps you! Thanks!

review/text: I bought these for my grandson who is 7 months old. He loves them and they are just the right size for a snack between feedings. His mom likes the convenience and ease in taking them along. I like ordering these and having them shipped directly to their house. It makes me feel like I have sent them a little present that is practical and appreciated.

review/text: Do not buy this stuff, it's absolutely horrible. Actually did not order this item, had ordered the "marinade" which is a completely different item and was shipped this stuff instead. I'd already purchased this item at my grocery store and it was disgusting. Went through several botched deliveries with Amazon and this item. Only to find out that the marinade is no longer available. Donated the "sauce" to a local food bank.

review/summary: NO MORE CRAMPS!
review/text: I used to have EXTREMELY bad cramps during my time of the month. When I say EXTREME, I mean cramping so bad that I would have minor blackouts. My mother-in-law suggested I take some organic virgin coconut oil and I took a tablespoon of it, however it didn't taste good at all. It did make my cramps go away for that entire day. So my wonderful husband went out and bought me some of these capsules from the health food store, I was kind of skeptical b/c he paid $20 for it, but I thanked him and started popping the suggested amount, 3 caps, 3 times a day.<br /><br />Since the caps have a small amount in each cap, you have to take that many to get it in your system. The first month I took them, the cramps subsided to just enduring slight pain in the morning on my first day. The second month I didn't experience any PMS symptoms and even less pain on the first day. The third month I experienced NO PMS and NO PAIN through my whole 7 days. I've heard it is good for lowering your cholesterol and help maintain weight amongst other things. I'm just happy they made my cramps go away.

review/summary: Surprisingly delicious
review/text: They had several dozen cases of 11.7 ounce bags of this Brown & Haley Candy Cane Roca at Jack's 99 Cent Store a couple of days before Christmas so I couldn't resist buying a few.  I was a bit worried about how a combination of toffee, chocolate, and peppermint would taste but there was no need to worry because it works just fine.  I have really enjoyed them and so has everyone else who tried them--it is very difficult to eat just one or two.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Brown & Haley Almond Roca, these are the normal little bars of buttery, crunchy toffee dipped in chocolate but without the nuts and instead they are drizzled with some pretty intensely flavored peppermint icing, like the filling in a peppermint pattie.  I think they go especially well with tea but not as well with coffee as the regular Almond Roca.<br /><br />The pieces are wrapped in the usual hot pink foil which is so much fun.<br /><br />Each piece of candy has 60 calories including 4g of fat plus they unfortunately contain coconut, palm, and/or palm kernel oil.  I do have to knock off a star for containing such unhealthy fat.

review/text: Our son has been eating another brand of gluten free bread for the past two years and when we tried this - he is sold. Tastes like white bread and he has been eating it up!  I did use the oil when making it over the butter.  I've found that the oil for some reason the mix rises better and cooks well.  Using butter instead, I would never eat this again! I thought it was terrible when made with the butter.  Then we tried the oil - it's a totally different bread.  Wonderful.

review/summary: Perfect Bread Mix
review/text: I'm surprised at the review for this product prior to mine. We are Gluten and Casein Free in our house and this is the BEST bread mix we have found yet. We use Smart Balance Vegan butter (made with olive oil) and this recipe tastes perfect. I'm VERY picky about the bread I eat and so are my kids, this tastes soft and isn't $8 a box. We get them from KA direct and its only $5.75 or so a box. Worth every penny for those looking for a good GF bread.

review/summary: Can be made to be egg free. The closest thing to "real" bread that I've had in the two years I have been gluten free.
review/text: I bought this at the store and it sat in my pantry for a few months before I decided to finally make it. Boy have I been missing out. This was seriously the best bread. We have been using Bob's Red Mill Wonderful Bread Mix (and making it in our Cuisinart CBK-100 breadmaker). As far as taste, this bread blows it out of the water. However, the prep involved is much more involved. I want to try it in the bread machine but King Arthur does not recommend making this mix in the bread machine. They give directions on how to make it in the Zijorushi but the directions are not compatible with my Cuisinart.<br /><br />Since my two sons are allergic to egg, we used the 2 Tablespoons flax meal and 3 Tablespoons water substitution for each egg recommended on the King Arthur site and it worked out for us with this mix.<br /><br />It didn't really rise all the much and I was nervous but I put it in the oven anyway and it turned out GREAT! So don't be too worried if yours doesn't look like it is rising enough; it will probably be okay.

review/text: After trying a variety of pre-made gluten-free breads, I thought I would give this a try.  The yeast packet was not there, but should have been.  I called the 1-800 number.  The nice customer service lady talked me through what to do being that I happened to have had yeast in my cupboard (although recently expired).  The bread was easy to make.  Didn't rise like it should have, but that could have been my old yeast.  My husband thought it was ok.  Better than the gluten tortilla wraps he has been eating.  After pre-slicing the bread, I froze it with 4 slices per baggy.

review/summary: The best gluten-free bread!
review/text: This is the best GF bread I've ever eaten!  The mix is easy to use, with very clear instructions.  It does take a little time from start to finish, because it's yeast-risen bread.  But the results are worth it.  I have tried several mixes and recipes, and most of them either have a weird taste or crumbly texture.  This bread has a wonderful texture (like "real" bread) and tastes great.  One tip (this is also on the box) is that if your loaf lasts more than 2-3 days, slice it and store it in the freezer.  It will stay fresher that way.  Otherwise, it will become a little stale sitting on the counter. But even if it's a little on the stale side, it makes great toast!<br /><br />Stephanie<br />Indianapolis, IN

review/summary: NOT the Holy Grail
review/text: Just finished making a loaf of this bread.  The texture is OK, but the taste is really not good at all.  The flour mix seems to consist mostly of tapioca flour, and it gives the finished loaf a very odd, slightly sour flavor.  The aroma is like a big ball of steamed corn.  This bread basically tastes just like several other brands already on the market, and at $8 (in my supermarket) it isn't exactly a bargain.  Too bad, I was hoping for something better from King Arthur.

review/text: Bought this mix to make fatcakes that my granddaughter could eat.  Fatcakes are normally made from regular bread dough that after rising are pulled into round thin pancake shaped pieces from a piece of dough about the size of a golf ball.  The dough is then dropped into hot oil(375 degrees)and fried on both sides until golden brown.  The cakes are then drained on paper towels and sprinkled lightly with salt.  Gluten free bread dough does not have the elasticity of regular dough so you have to use two spoons, grab a piece if dough and drop it in the hot oil (much like you would a drop cookie) and then using the spoons spread it into as large a flat pancake shape as you can before it hardens.  Once it is as flat as you can get it you treat it like like a regular fat cake.  Great with soups, chile or ham and beans.

review/summary: The best gluten-free bread mix I've ever had
review/text: I have tried to make most brands of bread mix but this one is the best.  It looks and tastes like real bread.  It definitely rises higher and tastes better if you make it with vegetable oil not butter. I also replace one or two of the eggs with only egg whites so it doesn't taste as eggy.  Also let it completely cool.  Like all gluten free breads, it tends to feel gummy before it completely cools (2 hours). The King Arthur gluten free loaf pan (it has side ridges that help the batter cling better) definitely helps it rise better than my old loaf pan.

review/summary: Better than Starbucks for many reasons!
review/text: I tried this coffee before "just because."  It just so happened I had a migraine when I tried it the first time.  I've had migrains for years.  I had taken an Imitrex about an hour before I had my first cup of coffee.  Within abut 1/2 an hour, my migraine was gone.  Normally, I have to take at least 2 Imitrex and even then, the migraine hangs on.  Well, I had another migraine this time out and the same thing happened.  Exactly like the last time.  Not only did it kick my migraine, I also had more energy throughout the day.  The coffee also tastes fantastic!  It is dark, but not heavy.  My daughter (15) is also a coffee drinker and loves the flavored creamers.  She doesn't use extra creamer due to the dark coffee - she actually uses less because she likes the flavor of the coffee.  Starbucks is losing this family as a customer.

Even my husband rarely gorges on these, making one box last longer than you'd think.  But he sure is eager to keep a supply in the house!  And if you use them when entertaining (which is a great thing to do -- they're very impressive), be prepared for guests to ask to take some home with them.  :)<br /><br />I originally bought these on Subscribe and Save, disposed of the case of 12 pretty fast, and desperately wanted to reorder, but at the moment they're only available from a third-party supplier.  Amazon, please bring these back in house!<br /><br />Absolutely FABULOUS.

review/summary: Second Best Cookie in the World
review/text: These are wonderful cookies. The biscuit its self is buttery and crisp. The extra dark chocolate coating is incredibly rich, with just the right sweetness.<br /><br />However, I'm afraid it has to take a backseat to LU Cookies Le Petit Ecolier, The Little School Boy, White Chocolate.<br /><br />The obvious solution to the problem of which to choose........get them both!

review/summary: Here's To My Health!
review/text: Here's an item I picked up at a nearby Fresh and Easy market. They're a British company and they have a lot of imported European items. One of the latest that I picked up is a 5.3-ounce box of Petite Ecolier (Little Schoolboy) dark chocolate with biscuits. Each of the very delicious biscuits is topped with a thick wafer of very dark (70% cocoa) chocolate. Man, that really makes a delicious cookie! Yum! I can't recall ever having better. My thoughts were that these just had to be high in calories. Sure enough. One serving (two biscuits) packs 130 calories. It figures, doesn't it? Well, you know, I was reading that a serving of chocolate every day, particularly dark chocolate, is actually beneficial to one's health. Well, here's to my health!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Although these are the same calorie count as a regular MilkBone, they can be broken up into 4 individual treats.  My large dogs find the invidual snaps incredibly tasty.  At first my dog tated it, spit it out, then tasted it and spit it out again.  But soon thereafter she would quickly run to her "biscuit spot" and happily munch away.  I like the fact that they have added ingredients to help with joint issues.  Although the individual snaps are small in size, they are crunchy enough that the dog thinks it is getting a full size bone, I don't know how Canidae does it.<br /><br />I just ordered a 4lb box.

The description of the product does not mention this. My puppy ate the treats fine and seemed to enjoy them, but I found them to be a bit messy. After a treat there would be crumbs all over the floor. Nonetheless, my puppy found them tasty.

review/summary: SPECIAL to make even iced Tea!
review/text: Alot of people do not know how to prepare loose leaf tea and miss a chance for new and exiting taste treats!<br />  Although you need to purchase a loose tea brewer ie,'ball', then all you need to do is (after unscrewing the teaball top) is place about a 1/2 teaspoon of tealeafs (sic?) tealeaves--inside. CLOSE IT and hang the hook on the side of a 1/2 gal container that has been filled with water and sugar to taste. I uaually place my container in the 'fridge overnight and in the morning there is a delightful light iced tea waiting. Brewing times vary and you may add hot water to cold to make a stronger brew...This is so far my favorite. Let me know of any other really tasty tea,folks. ENJOY!!

Watching the order status both times was a nervous ordeal, as they waited three days, then sent it overnight (and both times I tried to time the delivery just so).  They came with the top half of the blossoms yet to open, and I never got them to bloom.  Overall, though, they served my purpose well.  They say doing your flowers yourself and via mail order is a terrible idea, but I am happy with my choice.

review/text: I love this product! It makes gardening easier when you can just spray and get rid of unwanted grass. The frustrating part is when you can't find it anywhere. It disappeared for months and I was afraid they weren't making it anymore.<br /><br />This is one product you'll always find on my shelves. I also like the Weed-Be-Gone.<br /><br />When I go to gardening stores, they are always trying to convince me to buy some other product when I already know what I want. This works! I don't want to add water, mix, etc., I just want to pick it up, use it, and get on with my life. I have to 'fight' my way to the check-out counter, but it's worth standing my ground. It's easy to use and effective. I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Finally - no more pulling grass in flower beds.
review/text: My "old" knees and back are making it increasingly difficult to pull grass in my flower beds, but I love my daylillies, dahlias, impatients and petunias.  I called the County Extension Agent for a solution and he recommended Grass-B-Gone.  I looked at the local big-box garden supply and was not able to find the product.  I was very surprised that Amazon had this product listed as available.  I ordered the package of 6 because it was cheaper this way.  It was delivered promptly and in good condition.  I love it and it has performed as advertized, kills the grass, with no visible harm to other plants.  The only problem I have with it is that I had so much to spray, the hand and wrist got tired of the trigger sprayer.

review/summary: Do not apply in Summer, know your grass!
review/text: I love this stuff. Killed all bermuda in my yard with two applications (one Spring, one Fall). It has never returned one year later. This will only work when applied during the bermuda growing season, which is Spring & Fall. Bermuda is dormant in the summer, so don't bother applying then. And be sure you know exactly what your invasive grass is or it won't have any effect at all. Are you sure it is bermuda? Not crab grass or another invasive grass? It will kill any hybridized bermuda lawn grasses like BOB sod. So you really need to know what is in your lawn before you try this. Use your state and/or county extension website to identify your local invasive grasses. If you aren't up to the research, hire a professional landscaper to deal with it. The active ingredient, Fluazifop, is illegal for retail sale in many states, so you won't find it in the big box stores like Lowe's, Home Depot, or Wal-Mart. And an online seller may cancel your order if you are in one of those states. But even in states where retail sale is illegal, a licensed professional landscaper can apply the more highly concentated form of Fluazifop.  This is not the same as Weed-B-Gone!

review/summary: Grass-B-Gone Works!
review/text: Works! I have a terrible invasion of Bermuda grass in a landscaped non-grass area after removing a large tree exposing the area to direct sunlight in Southern California. Did not see any results (The "leaves" will turn brown) until about 10 days after the first application. Directions state to re-apply after 7 days and do not cut the "grass" during this period. One 24 oz bottle does not cover much of an area as you must spray directly on the "leaves". I have a approximately 200 sqft area and one 24 oz bottle was not enough for one application. I would recommend buying 4 24's or the 40 oz container if you have the same or more than a small area like mine. Product does not seem to affect any of the other plants as well! Will be interesting to see if this very invasive grass comes back as rizoles(?sp) grow up to 1 foot underground making any mechanical removal virtually impossible in a developed area.
