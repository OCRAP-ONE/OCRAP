review/text: Naked Coconut Water is for people who want the real taste of water straight from the Coconut. With No Added Sweeteners, only Natures Sweetness. Loaded With Potassium and Electrolytes it does a Great job of Rehydrating. Does a body good. Subscribe and Save price is better than the Local Store, but I still can't afford to drink it everyday :-(  I wish it was Cheaper!!

review/summary: Naked water
review/text: I love Coconut and I tried a coconut water from a local health food store. Didn't like it at all. I read about this product in a magazine and since I was already at Amazon web site I thought I would try it. I love it! The only problem I have is I drank all of it in no  time and want more.  The flavor is not over powering like some waters can be.  It is refreshing and good for you.<br /> Don't hesitate to try, you will become a customer.<br /><br />THANK YOU!

review/summary: Best I have ever had, no comparison to others
review/text: I honestly cannot believe anyone would want any other coconut water,  I have tried a few of them and none compare to Naked brand.  I guess its a matter of taste and opinion.  But there is no way aI would recommend not buying before you try.  This has a perfect balance of flavor and sweetness with no added ingredients.<br />I wake up with one every morning.  It is so refreshing and so much better then any other drink.  Water gets boring, so this is the next best thing and so much easier to get down because of the great taste.  Don't buy because others don't like it, try for yourself first.

review/text: I grew up enjoying a lot of coconut juice as we would refer to it rather than coconut water.  This is the closest thing I could remember to drinking it out of the actual coconut.  It even has the coconut husk taste that took me by surprise.  Zico is next best. I'll definitely be ordering more especially since it's on special right now.

review/summary: Healthy, Earthy, Fast expiration for a boxed drink
review/text: I will start by saying that I am NOT an avid drinker of coconut water.  This was my first (and probably only) experience with the stuff.  I like trying new, healthy items when they come out and coconut water had been on my list for a while.  I decided to bite the bullet with this one since I am a fan of the Naked brand.  While I'm sure that the beverage is healthy and good for you, and may even qualify to college kids as a hang over drink, I, on the other hand, think that its distinct taste (not coconut-y, but rather 'earthy') and don't enjoy it.  I'd probably say that if you have ever had wheat grass drinks, you would like this.  If you don't like wheat grass, you probably will no like this.  (I'm not crazy about wheat grass, but I mix it into some drinks for the added health benefits).  While they are made of different ingredients and don't taste exactly the same, I think that the taste TYPE is very similar.  They will probably taste better in a nice, healthy fruit smoothie.<br /><br />It's also important to point out that the expiration date of the beverages I received was 2.5 months after I ordered it.  That may seem like a lot of time, but if it will take you a while to consume the drinks, you may want to keep that in mind.  I ended up bringing them into work and left them in the kitchen for anyone who would want them since I knew I wouldn't finish the entire box before it expired.

review/summary: Pretty bad, and I drink coconut water daily, have tried many brands!
review/text: I adore coconut water. Have since I was a kid. Have had it out of the shell (we are Caribbean folks), chilled, and from assorted canned and bottled types, with and without sugar. I've tried a host. Some brands I did not wish to revisit--VitaCoco is funky tasting to me. New Zico (bottle) sucks. Old Zico (tetrapak) used to be nice, but after an intolerable and underhanded experience with their marketers online, I refuse to buy them anymore. O.N.E. is fine, and my sister loves it. I've had Harvest Bay, Amy and Brian, Nature Factor, and some names I forgt. I prefer Taste Nirvana these days, when I can't get the fresh (ie, froms hell) or raw organic one that Whole Foods sometimes stocks.<br /><br />This was not good. Naked. Ugh. I was out and about, thirsty, and stopped into a Nutrition S'Mart to buy coconut water. This was the only brand they had that I hadn't tried, so I went for it. Ugh. Never again. I cannot recommend this to coconut water lovers.<br /><br />But, hey, I like to at least try other brands. You never know which one will rock your world.<br /><br />And, as they say, different strokes. You may like this brand.<br /><br />But you might wanna give Taste Nirvana, Amy and Brian, O.N.E. and some others a shot first, ya know? :D<br /><br />Happy gulping!

review/summary: Absolutely Satisfying
review/text: I bought a couple of these to try at Safeway and fell in love... I get dehyrdated easily because I am a busy single mom who often forgets to take care of herself, and when I'm really dehydrated I get headaches and fatigue that no amount of water can fix. I've tried sports drinks and they just seemed to make my headaches worse, so I ended up drinking pedialite to hydrate myself when it got really bad. When I saw this coconut milk drink by Naked I immediately wanted to give it a try, it had been a long day and my headache was killing me. The first taste was a bit of a shock to my tastebuds but after the 3rd sip I was used to the flavor and when the drink was done I felt so hydrated and revitalized and before I knew it my headache was gone! It was like magic! The next morning when I woke up groggy and irritable after a restless nights sleep, the first thing I reached for was the second Naked drink, and once again it worked it's magic. I felt so much better and that's when I decided to look and see if there was any place I could buy this drink in bulk and found it here on Amazon.com. I have never had a drink that hydrated me so well and made me feel so good after drinking it, this is my new magic potion and I'm recommending it to all of my family and friends!

review/summary: Naked 100% Coconut Water
review/text: Naked 100% coconut water delivered exactly what was promised: liquid from inside coconuts and absolutely nothing else. I've drunk the water from fresh coconuts in many countries, and when you can't have it fresh, Naked is as close as you're going to get. It's true that the pasteurization doesn't help the flavor, but it really doesn't hurt it much either. This is the wrong product if you're looking for sweetened, or otherwise messed around with, coconut water, but if you've had the water from fresh coconuts, Naked will not disappoint.

I am really happy with the flavor and you need NO DIP! I also noticed that these chips can be eaten and do not leave a residue or coloring on the fingers. Fantastic crunch and texture. Happy with the bags also. Needed scissors to cut open, but hey, they aren't all broken into pieces because of the strong bag. I liked the way they stood all twelve bags up in the box and then sat that box into the shipping carton. Nicely packed and arrived, crush free. Happy with the entire purchase.

You can pick them up here, at Target (who has the best prices), or your possibly your local grocery store.

So, be aware of weather when you order and order at the beginning of the week so it doesn't sit in a warehouse over the weekend.<br />They are delicious!  I had tried them at a local grocer.  But, the grocer was bought by a bigger chain and stopped carrying them.  So I have been very pleased that I can buy them through Amazon.

review/summary: Shipping problem ,but I tried again
review/text: It shipped Jan 19 and arrived Feb 1, so it took 12 days to arrive. I had to throw it away.Too bad because the first pizza I bought was really good and i intended to make it a steady purchase.But now I'm not so sure I trust this company again.<br /><br />I wanted to come back and write a better review.Since I love all these pizzas,I ordered again (and then again) and now  I get my orders with no problems.I do not know what happened with the first order but this one arrived in good time and the pizzas were wonderful.<br />I must say thses pizzas are so good they have spoiled me for eating any other pizzas.Even the ones in my home town.I have tried all the flavors Naan has and I love them all.I will continue to buy them &lt;3

review/summary: 10 star WOW  Please try this!!
review/text: It was the label that caught my eye because I love anything with ginger and with the lemon I assumed this would have a lovely bite, and then i read that the maker was into delicious yet nutritious foods. And NO high fructose corn sweetener!!!  YES!!!!<br /><br />Love that this awesome spread also has organic garlic, organic honey, organic lemon, organic spices, as well as the top organic flaxseeds and organic ginger.  Everything is 100% organic.  And it tastes so wonderfullllll.  Bear in mind this is not a tame spread, nor is it extremely spicey. If you love ginger and lemon you should love it.<br /><br />Suggesting that its addictive is probably going to far, but being mostly vegetarian I am always looking for hearty items that I can use on veggie burgers, steamed fish or grilled chicken for my guests.  And every one LOVED this. And I was even happier when I found out Amazon carries this product, which I buy a lot.

review/text: Wow, I saw Laxmi's lemony flaxseed spread with ginger at the grocery and thought I would try it because it sounded so unusual.  I am glad I did!  The spread is delicious, wonderful on crackers or bread, offering a wonderful light Indian spiced flavor.  It's a little expensive, but a little goes a long way and I am glad that I have a new addition to my appetizer / snack / light meal options.

review/text: While walking the aisles of Wegmans yesterday I came across this product, and after reading the back I though, "hey, this sounds kind of good!"  When I got back I tried it instantly on a multigrain craker and all I could think was WOW!  The spread is a little sweet, a little spicy, a little savory, and could honestly go with just about anything.  I can even imagine using this as an addition to my chicken marinade, or on top of baked salmon.  The possibilities truly are endless, and the best part is that this product is actually healthy.  So if you have the chance to buy this, you really have to give it a try - you will NOT regret it!

After moving to West Virginia I have been unable to find the "bread crumbs" until now.  If you have never used this product you should try it - creates a light "breading" on fish, chicken, veal etc. and can be used either when frying or baking your meat choice.  I am sure others have many variable options in using the honey panko bread crumbs - but the bottom line is - this product is fantastic.

review/summary: Delightful, crunchy and um....gone.
review/text: Freeze dried fruit is expensive, since many fruits are about 90% water, and strawberries are no exception. This little 1/2 lb container was made with 5 lbs of fruit.  The flavor is very concentrated, as was the price. Most people couldn't down 5 lbs of strawberries in a few minutes, but downing these little treats is something else again.  I'd look at them as healthy candy alternative. it contains the same  vitamins, materials, fiber and nutrients as 5 lb. of strawcerries  but it also has the sugar and calories as 5 lbs of fruit, too.  They're awfully yummy, so try not to get too addicted to them.

review/text: Strawberries never tasted so good! I've never eaten fresh strawberries before because FRESH ones were always hard to find! These freeze dried berries seem to have come from flawless berries because they - just - taste - so - darn - good. They almost look fake because they're so perfect, they're BIG, have a deep red color and emit a delightfully strong strawberry aroma. I couldn't stop digging into the tub and eating hand-fulls of them. If you love Strawberry N Cream flavored instant Oatmeal then you should definitely try making your own with these strawberries and steel cut oats! (I haven't found the perfect cream, any suggestions?) Also, it is VERY important that you use an airtight or vacuum sealable storage container for these, just after about five days the berries will begin to become soft and lose their crunch and some flavor.

review/text: I've been ordering these direct for a couple of years and am glad to find they're now sold by Amazon (so I can use Amazon gift certificates!). They are intensely flavored freeze-dried strawberries and they will make even the most boring cereal (say, Shredded Wheat & Bran) tasty enough to eat every day. Just try not to eat them straight from the container or they'll be gone in no time. I agree with another reviewer who advised putting them into an airtight container; otherwise, if you live in a humid area you can end up with a sticky, stale mess.<br /><br />Unfortunately they are really expensive but hey, they have definitely upped my fruit intake. I recommend the blueberries too.

review/text: I loved these dried strawberries.  In fact after I started munching on them right out of the container I had a hard time stopping.  It was sort of like eating potato chips, "Bet you can't eat just one!"  The only problem I have had is that once opened you probably should get rid of them quickly because the container lid just does not keep out the moisture and after a relatively short time you are eating something less than dried berries, more like potato chips which had laid around open for a few days.

review/text: I have used this product, bought at Sam's Club when I was a member, for many years. Works perfectly in my bread machine every time. Two pounds seemed an incredible amount when I started, but I found I could keep an unopened package in the freezer and transfer the opened package to a jar I kept in the freezer. When making bread, I simply add a couple of teaspoons of the frozen yeast from the jar directly to the bread pan.  I have had the yeast keep for about four to six years (two 1 lb packages) without a problem. I'm nearing the end of my last (4th) pound and looked to Amazon for a replacement. Glad to find it on Amazon even though it's a few dollars more expensive than Sam's. Still a wonderful deal! Dirt cheap compared to packets and small jars.

review/text: I was very excited to find this product.  It is suppose to be the same yeast as in the "Rapid Rise" and the product for bread machines.  I used the exact amount for my recipe: a typical 1/4 ounce strip envelope equals 2 1/4 teaspoons.  The end result was a baked product that tasted foul.  I contacted Fleishmann's Company the next morning.  I was told that they would replace the two pounds of yeast I had purchased with a (three envelope strip with a total of 3/4 ounces).  When I pointed out that this did not seem reasonable, they said they would replace the two pounds of Fleishmann's yeast with a coupon for a 4-oz glass jar, and pointed out that I had complained about another product from their company in the past.  I was further told that I would not have any future defective products compensated for.  (?)  This is not a company that stands behind their products, and apparently they are not committed to a reasonable level of quality control.

review/text: I love the taste and texture of these bars.  The only problem is that there are 2 servings per bar, which makes them a bit less convenient.  Still, they are moist and chewy, and very satisfying.

review/summary: Not SUPER-delish, but not that bad either.
review/text: My favorite Bear Valley bars are the Carob Cocoa and the Fruit'n Nut ones, but they were out of them a few weeks ago so I thought I'd try this one for the first time.  While I have to admit that it's a bit on the dry side, the flavor is unusual but not unplesant.  And the dryness might actually be a very good sign: it means that they didn't add a lot of oil or butter to moisten it up...just eat it with a glass of milk or water/tea/coffee, I suppose.  No biggy...the pros still far far outweigh the cons:<br /><br />Because like the rest of the Bear Valley bars, it is a complete protein and has an unbeatable dollars-per-calorie value. I'm a very physically-active male with a high metabolism, yet I really CAN eat this bar as a meal replacement, it keeps me feeling full but never bloated or gassy (unlike many others) for a good 3-5 hours...that would normally require at least two ClifBars or at least 3 of a cheap grocery store granola bar. Anyway, if you just need a little snack to tie you over for an hour or so, have just half of a bar at a time.<br /><br />I've also eaten 1/4 to 1/3 of these bars at a time just before a long run or during (about every 45 minutes) a long run, and with no ill effects stomach-wise. That, in my opinion, is a good testament to its digestibility and quality, organic ingredients.<br /><br />The only TINY gripe I have about these bars is that it's damn near impossible to tear open the wrapper with your bare hands unless you take something sharp and slash a hole first...so I just use a pair of scissors, quick and easy. But then again maybe that's a good thing, means you are assured of these things staying fresh for a long time without needing a bunch of artificial preservatives.

review/summary: Manufacturer put WRONG food in can!
review/text: Because of all the good reviews about Blue Buffalo dog food, I've been using this (expensive) dog food for about 6 months. I have 2 large dogs so sometimes I go through 5 cans a day. I've mostly purchased through Amazon. This past order, I opened a can of  Chicken Pot Pie which is supposed to be 'chunk' style with clearly identifiable peas, potatoes, etc. This time, I opened a can and it was mush food. Not knowing how it got messed up in the processing plant, I did not feed it to my dogs (thus losing the $2.30 that I paid for the can). I immediately went to Amazon.com AND Blue Buffalo and wrote to their customer service departments about this. NEITHER company has contacted me back and that was 3 weeks ago! So, I decided to start randomly opening the other cans (they all came in one 12-can carton that was wrapped in plastic) to see if all the cans were wrong.  Fortunately, they were not wrong so somehow the company mislabeled one of the cans during processing. The reason that this could be extremely dangerous for us is if it was beef as one of my dogs has so many bowel issues after eating beef that I only give him poultry and fish products.  Luckily, I did not feed them this can and threw it away.  However, this has tarnished my trust in this company. At the very least, either AMAZON or Blue Buffalo should have responded to my concerns. I've been waiting to get an email asking for my 'review' because I feel this is the only forum that will give any attention to this potential problem that other people could experience. My dogs are precious to me and I go to great lengths to exercise and nourish them which means I have to put trust in other companies to help me do just that. I'm now looking for homemade dog food receipes and have started making some myself this past week. I hope this was helpful to you.

review/summary: If you have a picky eater, problem solved
review/text: I have spent a ridiculous amout of money trying to get my 2 new dogs to eat.  I tried the major brands and the expensive brands, researched the internet for recommendations, wet/dry you name it.  I was always faced with the few sniffs and then the look up at me in bitter disappointment. I never was a dog person but these two were dumped by me so I took them in (the vet said they looked like at one time they had been pound dogs because of spaying tatoos). I felt sorry for them and would give them table scraps...big mistake.  I also used treats for housebreaking. They had a feeder which contained what was described in research of consumer reports as a "guarantee your dog would love" that they would walk over to and sniff and walk away. I put the Bingo-Mega in there and now they are excited when I give them their dish. My neighbors are going to be very disappointed that their dogs will no longer be receiving the bags, cans and treats my dogs refused.

review/summary: mmmmm I love this stuff!
review/text: I got this for my husband who uses one of the old bar soaps known for leaving a "sticky soap film" behind.  He is a man of habit though and wouldn't use it even when I reminded him of the great commercial they had for the super bowl.  So, I hid his soap and left him with either this or puppy shampoo for his morning bath.  That did the trick! Not only that but this stuff has a really nice, subtle masculine scent.  mmmmmmmmm, I LIKE this stuff!  He smells sexy but not until you get really, really close, so I don't have to worry about the girls at work "sniffing after him".<br /><br />In the interest of writing a good review I did some additional research and used it on myself in the shower:  This product lathers nicely, and rinses very clean.  It does a good job of washing off sweat, dirt, grease, etc. without having to reapply.  After using it, I did not have dry or itchy skin and I felt clean and refreshed.  The scent was faint and kinda woodsy, it reminded me of sandlewood but very subtle.  While this product is for men, I would use it again. As for my husband, I hope he keeps using this -- did I mention? -- mmmm I LOVE the smell of this on him.

Not much more I can ask from such a product. I saw from the Amazon page that you can save some money by subscribing to it. That's a good thing as it's a little bit pricey. But, it works well and I like it. I'll save one star for the high price but it earned the rest as a high quality product.

review/summary: A Nice Combination
review/text: When it comes to a body wash, I want something that's going to leave me clean and smelling better than I did when I took a shower.  But I don't want it to be so overpowering that other people flee the room when I enter.  I also want something that's on the masculine side of things and isn't overly floral.<br /><br />Enter the Dove Care for Men series.  I figured I'd give it a try and see how it works.<br /><br />So far, it's pretty good.  I swim laps a couple of times a week in a heavily chlorinated indoor pool.  So my first expectation is that the body wash would help remove that feeling of dryness and general chlorine-ness that can sometimes occur.  And it did that.<br /><br />The good thing is the dispenser on the top is large enough to get out enough but not so big that you're getting a ton more of the body wash then you need.  It allows for a greater degree of control and to use as little or as much as you need.  (I tend to err on the side of starting out with too little and getting more as needed rather than having too much).<br /><br />As for the scent, it's fairly subdued and not overpowering.<br /><br />A nice combination.

review/text: Ok, to tell you the truth, after a read Mad Max's review, with a discussion of all the chemicals in this product, I am just a wee bit scared of this stuff. Are all these things necessary in something to bathe in?<br /><br />I have a couple of other issues with it as well. Personally, I thought the smell of it was very strong. Yes, I guess they want it to smell manly, but this stuff was rather overpowering.<br />Wouldn't it just be easier to make something with a very faint odor or no scent that perhaps the entire family could use and then if you would like to add a scent to oneself...aftershave or cologne or perfume, depending on ones gender, you could choose to do so. All these layers of scent seem just a bit much.<br /><br />And I also think the packaging is awkward.

While I personally like Clearisil because it really leaves your face feeling dry and clean, this is still a nice face wash.  It is more of a moisturizer when it comes down to it.<br />But I'd have to say that where the product really shines is the body wash aspect of it.  It is soothing, moisturizing, and has a really nice smell.  I recommend it.

I can still smell this scent on my husband for several hours but it is very light. This product says that it is for face and body but my husband uses it for shampoo also. It takes only a small amount for loads of suds.  Even though my water tends to be hard, it is still hard to get this product off and in fact needs to be gotten off with a wash cloth. Would recommend this product but maybe not if you have soft water.

review/text: I've been using Dove for Men + Care Deep Clean Body Wash for two weeks now. There's really not a lot to say when reviewing body wash so I'll break it down briefly.<br /><br />I have not noticed a change in how soft my skin is or how moist/dry my skin is.<br /><br />The scent is masculine but not overpowering. I do not notice a lasting scent on my skin throughout the day.<br /><br />It works up a good lather.<br /><br />It says to use it as a face wash, however, I've noticed my face is oilier and I've had a couple breakouts on my forehead. This is not normal for me and wasn't the case until I switched from my Clean and Clear face scrub to this. I will discontinue using this as a face wash.<br /><br />This is all around a decent body wash. The price is cheap and it works as well as most anything else you'll find comparatively priced. I haven't noticed a positive change in my skin since using this product and have noticed a negative change to the skin on my face since using this product.

review/summary: Improvement over what I was using!---I like it.
review/text: I have been using a wash that comes in the green container, you know which one.  I've been satisfied with that product for a long time.  Had the opportunity to try Dove Deep Clean Body wash.  There is a big difference and I like it!  I find that I use a lot less, it makes a great lather and rinses off leaving a good clean feeling.  The scent is a great change, it is not strong but refreshing.  I know scents are subjective and we all like something a little different, I just happen to find this very pleasant.  I do live in a very dry area (Arizona), this seems to leave a bit of moisture on my skin, I just don't feel that dry skin feeling as before.  The container is easy to handle, the cap is on the bottom so it always is ready without doing a lot of bottle squeezing.  My wife has always used Dove products and is a big fan, this is true to form and certainly is not a let-down for me.  I must recommend this on my experience.  I know we all have different skin, preferences for smell, and expectations.  This suits me fine and an improvement over what I had been using.  Hope this will be a bit of help if you are thinking about purchasing Dove for men.

review/summary: Nice smell, comparison to Nivea for Men, Softsoap SPA...
review/text: Summary: Main difference from other body washes seems to be the nice smell that lingers more than other body wash.  For better moisturizing I'd recommend Softsoap Spa Moisture Wrap.<br /><br />"Dermatologist recommended, Micro Moisture for total skin comfort, Clinically proven to fight skin dryness??"  Maybe, but I couldn't really tell anything different.<br /><br />I have been using Softsoap SPA (Exfoliating Sea Salt and Moisture Wrap Essential Oil) and also had a new bottle of Nivea For Men Sensitive body wash.<br /><br />I tried these for a few days - using one body wash on the left and another on the right side of my body to see if I could tell any them apart.  The main difference is that the Dove has a pleasant smell.  Not overpowering.  Fresh out of the shower my wife thought I smelled nice.  as a result I don't think she'd use this body wash as it definitely is a "guy" scent.<br /><br />The Nivea smells nice but the smell won't linger on you after you rinse.<br /><br />As far as moisturizing, it's winter and very dry.  I wasn't able to see any significant difference between the Dove Men and the Nivea for Men products.  However, the "Moisture Wrap" version of the Softsoap SPA body wash definitely left my body feeling like there was something going on - kind of the difference between using a conditioner in your hair and not.<br /><br />If you've found this review helpful or have questions/comments, please let me know!

review/text: Finally a Body Wash for a Man.  This bottle opens from the bottom and only comes out when the bottle is squeezed.  Lathers up quickly and leaves a clean feeling on skin. Not harsh on or drying of skin.  Rinses off easy, does not have a soapy film feeling that's left behind after rinsing off.  Leaves a light clean scent, not offensive or girly smelling.  Skin does feel healthier after about a week of use.  Safe to use all over including on sensitive dry skin.  My son (10) uses it as well, he wants to have his own bottle. :)  Since your skin is your largest organ, makes sense that you keep it healthy.  Women have been doing it for years.  Makes sense that a product like Dove Men + Care is geared towards a mans skin care needs.  Great Product!!! A+

review/summary: Clean and Moisturize Without Oily Slickness and Overpowering Fragrance
review/text: Like many older adults, I have found that many bath soaps dry my skin.  During the Winter months, in particular, I've often needed to apply skin lotion after bathing to prevent itching even though I used a so-called "moisturizing bar" for my showers.  Liquid body washes for women are often oily and have a strong perfume smell.  They can also make a shower floor or tub slippery and dangerous.<br /><br />For more than a week, I have been using this product for my showers and have enjoyed the result.  I wet a washcloth, squirt a glob of gel about the size of a finger joint into the washcloth and then have enough lather to wash my face and body.  The fragrance is mild and masculine and the lather rinses quickly and cleanly without leaving an oily residue or slickness on the shower floor.  One pleasant result is moist skin and no itch, even though we're still having cold northeastern Winter days.<br /><br />This product, when used properly, shouldn't cost more than Dove men's bars and you won't need to do much rubbing to get a nice lather once the gel is applied to your washcloth.  As long as I continue to get the same results, I'll probably reorder this product and continue using it.  It's certainly worth a try for men who are looking to improve their bathing experience.

review/text: The "Dove for Men" body wash has a nice feel - it lathers lightly, has "microbeads" that help clean the skin, and I did not find it to have a heavy fragrance.  The smell was somewhat reminiscent of a man's cologne, but light. I am sensitive to strong fragrances, so this was a benefit to me.  I do note that some reviewers have different opinions about the scent, however.  Lastly, the product contains moisturizers.  I did find that my skin felt smooth, and the Dove wash did not leave a film or feel slimy.  I liked it.

review/summary: Dove Understands Men
review/text: My husband's first reaction after using this body wash was, "It's unexpectedly gritty."  He said the smell was just okay, though I loved how it smelled on his skin.  Very manly and enticing.  Then he went on a trip and I tried it myself (I didn't want to smell like a man while he was home; this stuff has a *very* distinctly masculine scent) so I'd have firsthand knowledge of its performance.<br /><br />After the getting past the somewhat poorly designed cap (hard to open), the grittiness was the first thing *I* noticed, too.  I've often used various exfoliating scrubs, so the experience is not unknown to me, but I somehow felt that this stuff would not actually do anything but uselessly scratch the skin.  I used it on my face, which I found uncomfortable, and despite taking great care, I felt like I got some grit in my eyes.  And the smell was absolutely overpowering.<br /><br />I usually apply body lotion after showering, but I didn't this time so I could evaluate the product's moisturizing ability.  My skin felt kind of tight and irritated, especially my face, but this passed after a while (except for on my hands and feet, which seemed to be much more dried out than they are after showering with my regular soap, currently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R961M0">Dove Cool Moisture Beauty Bar</a>).  In places (such as my shoulders), I noticed that the body wash had left a waxy residue.<br /><br />Then my husband came home and tried it again.  This time he said he *likes* the grit, and he reported that it did not cause him any irritation anywhere (even on sensitive parts).  And he said he really likes that it easily washes off very well (a perception I didn't share).  He still likes the scent, but he (unbelievably!) said he prefers something with a stronger scent (he uses <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019ZB62Q">Zest Body Wash Shower Gel, Aqua Pure</a>) to get him going in the morning.  He likes this enough to continue using it, but when he runs out, he said he'll go back to his regular body wash.<br /><br />Overall, I would personally give Dove Men + Care (awkward name, isn't it?) three stars, with the highlight being the scent.  But since I'm not the target market here, I'll give it what my husband voted, four stars.

review/summary: Good body wash.  Unsure about the "purifying beads"
review/text: I've been using this now for a few weeks and the product works just fine.  My skin has not been as dry as compared to other body washes.  I know that there is a claim that you can use this to wash your face and I haven't really used this wash for that.  The "purifying beads" are just fine and as a body wash work just fine.  So long as you don't mind having little pebbles in your body wash.  But I don't know that I would buy this just for that reason.  The smell is manly and doesn't last overly long.  I.e. you won't smell strongly for very long which is just as well.

review/summary: Dove for Men and more
review/text: I tried this product after using a few other 'Men's' body washes when I didn't want to smell like a fruit or a flower. After tiring quickly of the 'sport scent' types, this was a refreshing change, pun intended. This is a more wood/exotic scent. Still a bit sporty, but not in the surfer dude way, more in the (dare I say) sexy way. I didn't find it overpowering, and the scent is compatible with an oriental or wood cologne. I think the only citrus it would work with is a bergamont scent. Lathers nicely. Great for a woman in the winter months, and for a man all year long.

review/summary: Too gritty to be a moisturing facial wash
review/text: My first impression is that the scent is nice. It's a clean soapy scent but not as strong as Irish Spring or some of the other men's body washes out there.<br /><br />The problem is that it is way too gritty/grainy.  For a body wash whose description focuses on moisture and "skin comfort" and is also meant for use on your face, I was a little surprised that it was so abrasive.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good exfoliant it might be a good choice but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is looking for a moisturizing facial wash that promotes skin comfort.  I think the product description/marketing is all wrong.  Had I been looking for a super clarifying exfoliant I think I would have been pleased.

review/summary: Nice product - inconvenient bottle
review/text: I normally prefer to use bar soaps in the shower as I find that most gels don't go very far and I end up using half of a bottle of soap in one shower.  However, this soap foams quite a bit and goes really far - one dab will do you, as the old commercial used to say.  The soap is clean, fresh-smelling and works well.  The scent is not overpowering (my other fear about this product before I tried it)... it's subtle and quite nice.<br /><br />Now, for the only downside... the bottle.  The top of the bottle is curved so it's impossible to stand it on the other end. Why, might you ask, would you want to do that.  The bottom of the bottle is where the product comes out.  Picture yourself in the shower... you've just squeezed out some soap and you need both hands to lather up so you want to put it down MOMENTARILY.  If you could rest it on its top (which, since the product comes out on the bottom actually is like the bottom of a normal bottle), you could then easily access more product if you need it.  However, since you can't rest it on the top because the top is curved, you have to close the bottle, turn it upside down, and then put it down, three steps.  If you want more product, you have to pick it up and then open the bottle again.  Sounds like a small detail, but when you're late for work and just trying to get a quick shower, who wants all these acrobatics with a bottle?  Just poor design and not well-thought through but it's a new product on the market and I'm sure they will correct this going forward.<br /><br />I'm sure a marketing person somewhere "pitched" the top of the bottle as echoing the shape of the classic Dove soap bar (not to be confused with the chocolate Dove bar...)  and therefore suggested its curve.  Clearly they didn't actually take a shower with this bottle.<br /><br />In summary, excellent product, with packaging that needs a change.  Hope this is helpful!

review/summary: Good but Leave it Off Your Face
review/text: You'll get a nice, brisk wash from this, but I don't recommend using it on your face (despite its claim that it's a face and body wash) - the gel is thick and does not easily rinse off your face.  But if you stick to using it from the neck down, it's a nice product and a fresh wash.

review/summary: Very good body wash
review/text: I have very dry skin in the winter which drives me crazy with itching etc.  I've tried most of the skin lotions out there, with none really taking care of the problem.  This Dove body wash seems to work quite well. I have not used it for long enough to be certain, but so far it looks like a very good product.  As such I recommend it.

review/summary: Much Better
review/text: My husband said he preferred using this over the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TSA916">Dove Men Clean Comfort Body Wash</a>. He said it had more lather, and the exfoliation left his skin feeling cleaner to him. He thought the scent was about the same between the two products, but it wasn't as overpowering as something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MASTQU">Axe Revitalizing Shower Gel</a>.<br /><br />Even though our family uses other Dove products like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET7KC2">Dove Shampoo</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET7IQK">Dove Soap</a>, this is the first Dove men's product that my husband really liked.

review/summary: Good Soap, Bad Marketing...
review/text: Dove soap makes me think of gentle soap for ladies and babies. Calling it Dove Men+Care Clean Comfort does little to dispell this idea, especially considering how prominently the gentle dove logo is displayed. Yet I put aside my manly pride and decided to give it a try...<br /><br />Using the soap was a new experience. The soap itself is a weird pale blue color, and rather thin. When you start the lathering process, you will find it doesn't really produce a lot of lather, which is a little disappointing. Now, this is compared to the lather of New AXE Snake Peel Shower Scrub - 12 oz which I normally use. I am afraid the Dove Men+Care lather would take extra scrubbing when cleaning up after the weekend car maintenance. In fairness, I haven't tried it under really tough conditions, but I will update this review if I find out otherwise.<br /><br />The scent of the soap was weird, and I hated it at first. It smells a little flowery at times, and musky at others, but overall, the smell is really faint and hard to define. You can hardly smell it. It's a real contrast to those soaps that wake you up like smelling salts. Overall, the scent was ok to me, but the real judge was my wife. She has told me immediately after I started using this soap that I really smelled good. Mission accomplished.<br /><br />The "Micro-Moisturizing" aspect of this soap basically means that this soap forms a slick coating on your skin when you lather, which seems to be quickly absorbed by your skin or rinse off; then, after you dry off, your skin is left a little less dry. I like this aspect, although I don't know that I would seek it out except in winter. These dry winter days leave your skin pretty scaly, and this soap helps a little bit.<br /><br />Overall, a good soap, but not a soap I would be likely to slip in the cart. My wife, however might, and if she did, I wouldn't be too disappointed. She likes my scent when I shower with it, and it makes my skin a little less scaly.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: A clean-feeling body wash that goes easy on the fragrance
review/text: Part of Dove's new men's skincare line, Dove Men + Care's Clean Comfort Body Wash lives up to its no-nonsense name.  The creamy, blue gel has a light, fresh fragrance that goes a long way in the lather department.  More importantly, it rinses off cleanly without leaving any oily residue behind, but doesn't leave the skin feeling too dry, either.  Best of all, the subtle residual scent left behind smells clean without being cloying, meaning it won't do battle with your cologne.

review/summary: Husband said "It was OK."
review/text: I selected this for my husband to try. He said there was barely any lather compared to other body washes that he's used. Lather doesn't necessarily make you any cleaner, but the lack of suds was a negative.<br /><br />The big positive was the scent. My husband doesn't like smelling like a piece of fruit, but I am very sensitive to strong scents (ex: perfume, cologne). Body wash scents like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MASTQU">Axe Revitalizing Shower Gel</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GR7KBO">Old Spice High Endurance Body Wash</a> trigger an allergic reaction in me. I'm happy to say that this men's body wash from Dove isn't too strong to be around, but my husband wasn't impressed with it -- he thought it didn't really have a distinguishing scent.<br /><br />Overall, it will get your man clean, but Dove hasn't really won us over with this one.

review/summary: Nice Soap
review/text: Overall a success in my book.  Nice aftershave smell, washes off easily, seems to have the Dove quality and performance intact.<br /><br />Packaging is good with a well designed container and "manly" look for those who feel their masculinity may be threatened by a bottle.  Did not have the manly Shower Tool to accompany my showering experience but it's nothing a loofah and scrunch couldn't handle.  Not too sure what "Micromoisture Technology" really is, though.  Water?  Olive oil?<br /><br />The price point seems a bit high but anyone who orders this product shouldn't be disappointed as long as expectations are in check.

review/summary: Too much perfume for me... cleans well though.
review/text: Not too much to add to the title. 3-stars cuz it works, no more cuz it's too smelly for my use. This seems like a product in search of a niche. I mean, soap works, right?<br /><br />My predominant shower soap is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E0VAUY">Clearly Natural Soap Glycerine Peppermint 4 oz ( Multi-Pack)</a> (and other "flavors"). I started using glycerin soap when I found out that it cleans as well as regular soap but doesn't leave soap scum to muck up the bath/shower. When I saw this as a choice on Vine, I thought, "What the heck? Give it a try. You can always clean off the scum."<br /><br />This product cleans well and leaves a slippery feeling to the skin (we have softened water) when rinsed off, but it leaves a very obvious aftershave-like smell: it actually work me up several times during the night the one-time I used it to shower with. So, no more showers with this for me! However, I am using it during the day to wash the old armpits. It really does clean and de-smellify well.<br /><br />Added after reading the previous reviews: there is a "technical problem" with the container. The lid is on the bottom and not easy to open when your hands are wet. Also, if you use it at the sink (like I do for my armpits), the stuff drips out when you open it - OK in the shower but not at the sink.

review/summary: Just like Dove Bar soap but in a bottle
review/text: I was expecting Dove Men + Care Clean body wash to be more "man" specific.  It seems like just plain Dove Soap in a bottle.  We use Dove Soap all the time and have always liked the soft and clean feeling it leaves my body feeling after a shower, but my son and husband call it "girly" soap and always opted for Axe or some other brand of "man" soap, although they are all very drying to their skin and I have to listen to them complain about dry winter skin.  When Dove Men came out I was thrilled that it would finally be more of the "man" soap they want with the  great Dove non itchy soap.  Well, it is definately still the great Dove soap, but it still can't compare with Axe as far as smell. It isn't quite up to the same cologne type smell that Axe or other brands made for men have. I give it 4 stars because Dove is a wonderful soap, and this is a bit more on the manly scent side, but not enough.  Some men don't like a strong smelling soap so this may be great for them, but unfortunately for my guys they want a stronger smelling cologne in their soap.
