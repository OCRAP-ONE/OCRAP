review/summary: great stuff
review/text: I've made a couple of different cookies with this flour and it is just great.  I made Russian Tea Cakes which is basically flour and butter. I was afraid the cookies would be too crumbly and not hold their shape.  But they were perfect. I mailed them to my daughter and they kept their shape through delivery.  Nice and flaky and buttery.  Yum!  I also like this flour mix because it doesn't have baking soda or powder in it.  So I don't have to adjust my recipes.  I use it straight, cup for cup.

review/summary: Not Impressed
review/text: I bought this product because I was desperate to find a gluten free, casein free, and nut free product.  I bought a case of this flour and the muffin mix. I've tried cooking it several different ways, and everything stays gooey in the middle.  I even tried a bananna muffin recipe on the bag, and it was not good.  I'm giving it two stars for being a dedicated peanut free facility.  But, I do not like the product.  I have not tried making it into a cookie yet, so I will try to use my four that way since the other reviews say it was good in cookies.  Otherwise I'm stuck with a case of each!!!

review/summary: Perfect flour blend? Not a chance!
review/text: Having been GF for a long time and used to changing out flour in our favorite recipes I have to say this flour was one of the worst I have ever used. I bought it because of the several 5 star reviews but wow, what an expensive mistake. First were the lemon bars for a family Easter dinner that had crust like dry gritty sand that completely fell off the bars so into the garbage they went. Next were the two seperate attempts at oven baked puff pancakes called Dutch Babies which did NOT puff in addition to being pure goo that could NOT be eaten. (I cooked the second one longer thinking it just needed longer cooking....WRONG!) After wasting all those lemons, eggs and butter, I am very skeptical about trying this flour in anything. I have always had excellent results with Mama's coconut blend flour so will stick to that. It is also available on Amazon but needs to have the xanthan gum added as it is not in the blend already. This is a good thing since different types of baked goods need varying amounts of xanthan gum. Also, the texture of Mama's is soft and fine and most like white flour in comparison to the course sandy grit of this Namaste flour.

review/summary: horrible after taste
review/text: I've tried this product in several recipes. Even with the banana bread recipe right off the bag, there is a strong chemical aftertaste. Something I've not experienced with any other gluten free products. Same experience with a simple chocolate cake recipe. The texture is ok, but the aftertaste is overwhelming. And unfortunately you can't return this product.

review/summary: Quality product - poor packaging and shipping by Amazon.com
review/text: Amy's products are very good and I will probably order again. The problem is with amazon.com shipping. Every time I order some food product in cans there are at least 4 or 5 cans damaged. Unfortunately I live in a rural part of Kansas where certain products are not available unless you order them online. When Amazon figures out how to ship product that will arrive undamaged, then they will be a first class supplier of food products. In reading customer reviews, I notice that there are a lot of complaints about food items arriving damaged. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G18NO8">Amy's Organic Vegetable Barley Soup, Low Fat, 14.1-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>

I'm trying to order more and more packaged organic healthy foods in quantity online so I don't have to drive and so I can find brands not available at my local super.

review/summary: Delicious Taste. Low On Fat And Calories.
review/text: I've been trying a variety of organic products from Amy's Kitchen. In general, I'm very pleased. This evening I had a can of Amy's Organic Soup of the Vegetable Barley variety. It was excellent and went well with the other things of the meal. I thought the taste was delicious, if a little on the bland side. To counter this, I gave it a couple twists on my peppercorn mill and that did the trick. I love the all organic vegetable ingredients plus the barley and I appreciate the ultra-low fat and no cholesterol content. The soup was very low in calories at 70 per serving so having two servings didn't bother me at all. To me, the sodium is a little high, but within reason. Have you ever checked some of the other soups? This was good. It will be on my list to replentish.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Homemade Taste
review/text: Amy's Kitchen came into existence when Amy was born in 1987. Her parents were deeply committed to producing convenient prepared foods that tasted homemade. Amy's soups are now popular vegetarian foods that can be found frozen, bottled and canned.<br /><br />On a cold winter evening or a cool summer night, soup becomes extremely comforting, not to mention easy to prepare. You can be writing reviews and your soup is gently heating. In minutes, you have a nutritious meal that is completely vegetarian, low fat and has a delicious blend of vegetables. This is one barley soup where you won't miss meat. It is rich, delicious and comforting. I like serving this soup with a sprinkling of Darling Buds (petal power) salt seasoning and a little pepper. Otherwise, it is seasoned perfectly all by itself. Each vegetable in this soup tastes like it was cooked perfectly.<br /><br />Ingredients: Filtered Water, Organic Onions, Organic Barley, Organic Carrots, Organic Tomatoes, Organic Celery, Organic Leeks, Organic Zucchini, Organic Peas, Sea Salt, Spices, Organic High Oleic Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Organic Garlic.<br /><br />This product does contain GLUTEN. This product is also manufactured in a plant that produces foods containing wheat, milk, soy, tree nuts and seeds. Amy's Kitchen does not use any peanuts, fish, shellfish or eggs.<br /><br />I could swear this product has yellow squash in it.<br /><br />The components in barley seem to play an important role in lowering blood cholesterol, so to your health.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Tastes homemade, low cal yet filling
review/text: This along with another Amy's soup are the best tasting canned soups I've tasted. I thought it would be more calories with the barley, but is only 140 calories per can, compared to the Healthy Choice vegetable soup I'd been eating which was 200 calories a can, and not as healthy ingredient-wise.<br /> I'm dieting, and before trying this soup I'd have some whole grain bread with soup, to make it filling and like a meal...yet this soup is filling without bread, because of the barley, so that cuts down even more on calories.<br />Another thing, the vegetables are minced quite small, which means that every spoonful is DELICIOUS, as so many flavors fit into each spoonful!

review/text: This may just be more of a personal preference.  This soup is okay, but it's not great like some of the other Amy varieties I have tried.  It seems a bit watered down, but it is very low in calories (I think 150 or less for the whole can) so it would be great if you're trying to watch your weight and need to fill up more without consuming a lot of calories.

review/summary: Healthy Vegan Quick Lunch
review/text: This soup is another great addition to add to your pantry when you did not have time to cook something or leftovers have thus run-out. The soup does have a distinct barley flavor with lots of nice sized veggie pieces. Not too watery but deff not a thick, stick to the back of your spoon kind of soup. As far as nutrition goes, there are two cups to each can, per serving is 70 calories, 1 gram fat, 13 grams fiber 50% RDA of Vitamin A and 20% RDA of Vitamin C. I usually eat a salad with any of Amy's soup just to make sure i am not hungry by 3:30, but with all the fiber in this soup that might not be in issue. I was very pleased with this soup and do plan to get again. For all us vegans out there this is a good way to get in some good nutrients while being fast and delicious.

review/text: When my local grocer (Wegman's!?) stopped carrying Casa Fiesta whole chilis, I was at momentary loss where to find more.  No other grocer in the area carried them either - only the chopped variety, which is just not suitable for many culinary uses, not to mention the mushy consistency they bring. Makes a mess of my chunky guacamole recipe, for one thing, and chili rellenos are just not possible (unless you do what some restaurants to, and make them sorta inside out - bleah).  Thank you, Amazon, for providing me with what I hope will be an unending supply.  Two cases ought to hold me for a little while, anyway.  :)

review/text: Our whole foods diet makes eating tricky sometimes, so when I saw KIND bars in the supermarket I was really excited. Our tastebuds are used to nearly no sugar, no salt and absolutely no preservatives or additives so these bars hit the spot. The coconut and almond bars were chewy and crunchy with just a hint of sweetness and they were filling. One bar and I was ready to go for the morning! Mr. MVP had one KIND bar and a yogurt and a piece of fruit and he was on his way. Our supermarket had them for $1.50 per bar so $1.20 per bar is a decent price!

Eating one at the first pangs of hunger buys me a hour before I need a real meal, which is a life saver.  I have taken them on road trips and camping, and they are great there as well.  I love the fact they aren't covered in chocolate, as I'm not a fan of using candy for food.  The fact that they are gluten free means I can bring a box for celiac friends without concern, also a big plus.  I only wish I could buy them locally, but the Amazon subscription is almost as good.

review/summary: sooo good and no guilt -- what could be better?
review/text: I love these bars and even eat them once in a while as a substitute breakfast with yogurt.  They are so good, and not fattening and make a great on-the-go snack in the car or on the plane.  I have tried many other bars, but none even come close.  Every time I give one to a friend, they are hooked.  My 3-year old grandson loves them too, and I feel good that he asks for them as they have no artificial anything and aren't that high in carbs.  The deal on Amazon is the best with automatic shipping.  In most places they cost $2.00 or more each.  In bulk on Amazon they are $1.50 with no shipping charge.  This one is my favorite flavor, but I like most of the others almost as much.  So, happiness in a bar. . .

review/text: O-M-G...what can I say?  These are the absolute best bars I've ever had!  They are LOADED with coconut and nuts but, most of all, FLAVOR!!!  Gluten free to boot (though that doesn't matter to me), but someone that it does make a difference to...I encourage you to treat yourself to these...chewy, chewy, chewy and so flavorful...did I mention, chewy?!?!  The more you chew the more flavor you taste...just the right amount of honey, NOT the bland old sawdust granola bar you may think of...get them!!!

The flavor profiles of the bar subtely blends the fruity flavors of strawberry with the nutty crunch of peanut butter and almonds. They contain 190 calories in total and 100 of them are from fat and also are a good snack for the 4 gms of protein that you get with each bar.<br /><br />Overall a great healthy snack for your mid-afternoon after meal or late evening hunger pangs.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: So, there must be some mommies out there like me who buy these bars for kids but won't eat them yourselves? You pop them in the lunch box together with the fruit in the bid to get them to stay off the junk food in school? Most of the time, these bars turn out to be a complete waste cos the kids will tell you that they are the worst thing ever. And you are wracked with guilt thinking you've scarred them for life. But then, you do it again anyway. And so, one day, I tried 1 of these bars and when I asked how it was - the answer surprised me. "They're delicious, Mom. Really yummy" I was stunned. A nut bar that passes the test. I'm so glad there's Amazon. I bought 2 packs - one fruit and nut and another variety pack. She loves all that she's tried so far.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I took a couple to the office. One day, in hunger, I finally opened one. And Oh. I. see. They're good. Really good. They're crunchy without being hard, a little sticky without being too sweet, a good mix of textures without them sticking to the space between your teeth. And at the end of the bar, you feel something in your tummy. Not full exactly but at least it does the job to stave off the hunger pangs.<br /><br />I'm now looking at other flavours to buy because this is going to be the Snack Of Choice 2012 for this household at least!

I like the fact that it is all natural, no funny taste and no yacky after taste.  You can actually taste the fruits in each bar. I have a sweet tooth and Kind bar satisfies my craving.  Try it and you will see what I mean.  I recommend this to anyone trying to eat sensibly and indulgent at the same time.

review/text: Finally, a nutritious snack that actually tastes good! I normally don't like apricots but this bar is not overpowered by the fruit.  It's the right combination of almond and apricot flavors so that it's not overly sweet or nutty.  I do wish it were a bit bigger in portion.  It doesn't feel like a meal replacement but definitely a good snack. Even if you're not a big apricot fan, I highly recommend giving this one a try.  The monthly delivery service also provides a nice little discount!

review/text: I am allergic to wheat and hypoglycemic, so finding a wheat free, low glycemic snack bar sounded too good to be true.  Happily, it wasn't!  Every Kind bar I have tried has been delicious, and it makes a good "on the go" snack to keep in my purse.  It's also great to pack when I travel, since it is really hard to avoid wheat when I am eating out, and due to the hypoglycemia I have to eat meals on a regular schedule. I love the fact that Kind bars are made from real ingredients - the list of ingredient is short and I can pronounce everything on the label because it's the type of stuff I have in my pantry.  I ordered one box to try them out, then a few more to keep on hand, and now I have just subscribed for monthly delivery.  I highly recommend these bars!!

review/summary: I will order more!
review/text: While visiting with my sister I was given the opportunity to try a Kind Bar.  I hesitated because let's admit, anything that comes in bar form and is good for you has GOT to taste terrible!  Well, now I know differently.  These are delicious!  My brother-in-law is diabetic and can eat these bars.  I find eating one between meals curbs my appetite.  They are crunchy, fruity and just plain delicious.  Haven't been able to find these in our area stores so I order Kind bars through Amazon and I'm pleased with how quickly and safely they arrive.  I recommend these to anyone who wants to find an enjoyable way to have a snack between meals and that's good for them, too.

review/summary: LOVE THEM!!!
review/text: One of these bars were sent to as a free sample.<br />I searched online for awhile to try to find the bars at a good price. I finally found them on Amazon.<br />I LOVE THEM and love Amazon even more for continuing to sell items at excellent prices that I can not find anywhere else.<br /><br />The bars themselves are delicious. Coconut & Almond are my favorite flavor.

review/text: This is a great bar, we originally tried the coconut and almond but thought this one sounded good too.  The best part about these bars is they taste delicious and they are healthy.  They do not have corn syrup or a lot of other ingredients that most bars have, just natural good for you stuff.  I highly recommend them, they are worth the money.

review/summary: Excellent Snack.
review/text: These are really tasty, that's a fact.  Because they're made of fruit, nuts, and puffed rice, they're also reasonably healthy, making them a reliable snack.  I only wish these babies had a bit less sugar, therein allowing me to eat them more often than I currently allow myself to.  Of course, I'm sure that would mess up the flavor and make them an entirely different bar, so that's not really a possibility.)<br /><br />Overall, an excellent portable snack, with plenty of healthy fats and deliciousness.

review/summary: Satisfying & Delicious
review/text: These bars had a generous amount of nuts and the right balance of fruit without the overly sweet filling I dislike in other brands.  The result is a bar with enough protein to satisfy and just enough sweetness to give a little pep--a great bar for the grab-and-go breakfast with my coffee or for the 3 PM slump at work. The bars come in at 180 calories, which is just about right for a snack that also delivers protein, but maybe on the high end of snack portions for those watching calories. However, this is a nice sized bar; it doesn't feel like a tiny portion. This will become a regular addition to my pantry.

review/summary: Likely the best nut bar I've ever tasted
review/text: I had purchased these when they were about $15.50 for a box of 12 and although that is a bit pricey compared to a box of bars you can get from any other brand, it's much cheaper compared to the $3.29 that I had paid for just one bar at the airport and much better tasting than the rest of the nut bars produced by other companies out there!  Right before I was going on a transpacific flight, I wanted to get some snacks to hold me over so this was one of the items I bought at SFO.  As soon as I took the first bite, I remember thinking how good these were and knew that I had to buy these, once I got back to the states.  I ordered the Almond & Coconut ones and they are awesome!  One look at the ingredients and that tells you how there's nothing but all natural stuff in here and the taste is truly delicious!  Personally, I don't think there is a better tasting bar out there than this - it is so far THE best I've tried!

review/summary: Yummy!  A perfect snack
review/text: I purchased Almond/Apricot and Almond/Coconut and they are both delicious!<br /><br />These bars are made mostly out of almonds and other nuts, held together by sweet syrup (not too sweet).<br />Both have a hint of coconut flavor (Almond/Coconut has a slightly stronger coconut flavor). The apricot adds a bit of tang to the flavor, which I really enjoyed. I liked Almond/Apricot slightly better for this burst of tartness.<br /><br />Each bar is individually wrapped, long and slim, and easy to slip into a purse and bring along when you need a bit of pick-me-up on the go.<br /><br />I highly recommend these bars!<br /><br />I am attaching a photo with the wrapper off with one bite taken, so you can see the texture of the bar inside the wrapper.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/text: It's  a great gluten free snack to have with you when you don't know what's available for you in the "gluten free"  zone.  Some restaurants have gluten free food, some don't. At least you won't go hungry.  It's a delicious power bar snack.  Easy to have with you and much more affordable to buy online than in the store.

review/summary: Macadamia & Apricot - WOW!
review/text: I agree with the previous reviewer - these are very addictive!  I ordered the Macadamia & Apricot bars and they are simply wonderful.  The flavor is absolutely delightful.  The apricot flavor comes out first.  The macadamia nuts are evenly distributed so that you always get the nutty flavor along with the apricot flavor.  The third thing I got was the coconut (mmm, love coconut!).  When I ordered them I didn't realize they had coconut in them so I was very happy.  The coconut is not overdone either.  It's just enough to taste it along with everything else.  I am amazed at how they put these flavors together so wonderfully so that they all shine.<br /><br />I don't even like honey (can't stand it!) and even the honey flavor went superbly with the other flavors in this bar and was not at all overwhelming.  I caught the sweet undertones but most of the sweetness I tasted was from the apricots.<br /><br />I went on subscribe and save, then I went in and revised it to get MORE of them even more often!  BTW, the box I received had a 'use by' date of Oct 2013 on it, so they are very fresh.

review/text: This product tastes very good. The almond and coconut pairs well together. I can't find anything wrong with this product. It's not like the typical tasting fruit and nut bar, or a granola bar. Rather, it's in a field on its own. I appreciate how healthy it is for you (low calorie, low sugar, low sodium, gluten free, etc...) but you wouldn't know it by the flavor. I am certain you will like the taste of it.

review/text: As someone new to gluten-free living, I'm struggling to find "treat" options.  KIND bars go a long way towards filling that void!  The Apricot Almond is a little on the super-sweet side.  After trying the Mango Macadamia (AWESOME!) and Fruit & Nut w/ Yogurt (a pretty close second) I probably won't buy the Apricot Almond again.  But I won't have any trouble eating the ones I have, either.  :)

review/summary: Yes.  We like them.
review/text: It seems the almond & apricot bars were changed when they switched from the 8 pack to the 12 pack so that they added more apricot or sweetness in some way.  I was happy with the less-sweet version, but the taste is still divine. The kids' favorite are the fruit & nut, but this is a close second.  The subscription price beats all the market prices I've seen.
