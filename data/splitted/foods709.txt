review/summary: Vita coco...just o.k.
review/text: Just received the shipment yesterday. One of the bottles had broken during the transport, leaving the shipping box ruined.<br />The taste is o.k., but not spectacular. The label lists the ingredient as "Natural coconut water", so I'm not sure what the previous poster has seen about potassium added to the water, as there's no indication on the label.<br />I might buy one or two of these at the time at the store, but not necessarily much more than that.

review/summary: The real deal ! Not a doubt
review/text: What happens with coconut water's reviewers is that some of them, and I honestly don't mean any disrespect with what I am about to say, aren't familiar with the natural flavor of the real coconut water. For one to like this delicious natural water, you must be already accustomed to this particular flavor. Been from the Caribbean, I grow up drinking coconut water and boy do I miss it! What the person said in the not so good review: "It has a rather unripe taste that is not to my liking" is unfair because that specific unripe flavor is the signature in the real coconut water. So in my humble opinion, if someone isn't used to the flavor of this delicious pure water, it would be wise to buy one of the coconut waters which have some tropical fruits flavor added. I bought this Vita Coco pure (not additional flavor added) and have been delighted for I have bought a whole lot of other brands and they don't have the unripe taste which makes it so real. Trust me on this one, I gave five stars to this product because I know that this is, not doubt, the real deal when it comes to coconut water. I just hope that they keep its authenticity so that I will be able to get my "dose of the Caribbean" even from the distance, by treating myself to this deliciously divine drink. LOVE REAL COCONUT WATER!

review/summary: 100% Natural & Delicious.
review/text: I have to admit, at first, I was skeptical about this product. I've seen so called "Coconut" drink products that turned out to be nothing more than a watery, sugar loaded mess.<br />But this product, Vita Coco, is actual coconut water. It is clear and 100% pure. It has no sugar added, if it is sweet, it is naturally ocuring from the water itself,If you like sugary drinks, then this is not for you. I haven't had any problems with its taste and I'm happy with my purchase.<br /><br />I suggest drinking it cold with plenty of ice. This is as good as it gets, aside from actually craking open a coconut. Coco Vita is great, natural and delicious.

review/summary: Refreshing and more beneficial than regular water
review/text: I'll be honest, when I first started drinking coconut water, I wasnt a fan. Years of loving almond joys and those coconut cream filled eggs they have around easter time, I wasn't expecting real coconut to be so...well...not sweet.<br /><br />But after a few attempts, the taste really started to grow on me and I now love coconut oil (use it in my tea), coconut flakes (use it in my oatmeal), and coconut water.<br /><br />Vita Coconut seems to be larger in size/ounce than some other coconut brands out there. Also, it taste very fresh compared to cracking open a real coconut and drinking the water straight out of it which I have also done several times.<br /><br />I only wish that they products were made organically. That would have caused me to give it 5 stars. Also, I am not 100% thrilled with the packaging of this product, but I will say that it is still a lot better than having it in plastic.<br /><br />I recommend Vita Coco over the other coconut brands.<br /><br />And subscribing to them on amazon makes them the cheapest around at only about a $1.50 or so a drink as opposed to the $2.50 / $3.00 Ive seen them for in stores.

review/text: Dear Friends,<br />I ordered this pack and I received in good shape. I tried 2 packets (of the 12 pack) and both were pathetic(completly sour) in taste. The packing does say best before Mar 2012, and it is SPOILED and SOUR in taste(I am from India and have been drinking coconut water everyday for the last 6-7 years, so I know the taste of it). This might be due to high temperature in shipping from Brazil to my home(including all intermediate stops).I found Indian brand "Nirav" of good taste, and in future I would buy Nirav.

review/text: I saw Amazon was selling this but seeing as a lot of people were receiving bad shipments, I decided to find it in my local grocery store first before going with Amazon.  It is good!  I'm used to eating/drinking from the Thai coconuts which are sweeter than this, but I like these Brazil ones too.  I happened to buy a bunch on sale at the store and was worried they might be rancid, but they weren't.  I'm taking this on my road trip to help with the heat, although I'm sure I'll find some coconuts where I'm going :)

review/summary: VitaCoco is the only coconut water!
review/text: I have tried several brands of coconut water and this is my favorite by far!  It doesn't have the added sugar or pulp like some of the cheaper brands in the can.  It's all natural and smooth tasting.  I like the 17oz box because it has the twist off cap.  I workout a lot and on days with a lot of cardio, I will drink a bottle of this before and/or after my workout.  It has more potassium than 2 bananas, more electrolytes than a sports drink and it's all natural with no fat or cholesterol.  It's low in calories and keeps my hydrated.  I don't know what else I could ask for in a drink.  It also seconds for a great hangover cure.  After a long night of drinking alcohol, I slam a bottle of Vita Coco, with some advil and I never wake up with a hangover.  I have difficulty finding it from the local grocery store and when I do find it, it's actually slightly more expensive than purchasing and having it delivered to my doorstep!  Some of my friends like the vita coco with pineapple or mango, but I like the Pure Coconut Water!

review/summary: I love this coconut water but...
review/text: Vita Coco is the best tasting coconut water on the market today.  My 3 star review is not to knock the taste or the quality of this product, as it is to warn Amazon customers that ordering it here may not be a good idea.  Some of the containers were leaking and the product tasted like it had been sitting on a hot shelf for months.  This was very disappointing, as the only places I can find this great product are in the next state over in health food stores and Whole Foods.  The way Amazon keeps this product stored and ships it, ruins the flavor and causes the containers to be damaged.  I usually have positive experiences with Amazon's shipping, but this was a big exception.

review/summary: Packaging Design Flaw
review/text: I love VitaCoco and would drink it all the time if it didn't cost so much.  I also like having more to drink with the 17oz container, but the way that the container is packaged makes it impossible to get all of the beverage out of the container by pouring alone.  It gets caught around the plastic lip that protrudes into the container.  I usually end up cutting the top open, if I have something sharp handy, and get the remainder of the wonderful drink that way.  Just an FYI since I find it very frustrating to have to throw it away with some still left over.

But I don't coconut water is not delicious enough to make me want to drink when I don't have to (when not exercising). I wouldn't buy this for a casual drink but it's perfect as a natural sports drink.

review/summary: Coconut water that's exactly as it says
review/text: I'm a big fan of coconut water, and of all the boxed/bottled kinds, I prefer vita coco. There can be a slight inconsistency in tastes across different batches... But that's the issue with a natural product. No 2 coconuts are exactly the same. I actually prefer this than what companies do to orange juice (that is take out all the oxygen and flavor, and add back chemically produced "natural orange flavor" which makes the orange juice absolutely consistent, which I suppose some people like. It would be impossible for every batch of natural juice product to taste exactly the same, unless they modified it.<br /><br />Over all, I like the vita coco taste, and it's been one of the closest products to drinking from a coconut for me. It's also not from concentrate, unlike many of the other brands of coconut water.

review/summary: I'm coo-coo for Coco-Water
review/text: Vita Coco IS 100% pure; not all coconut waters can claim that! It tastes like you just stuck a straw in a green coconut and sipped the refreshing nectar and went "Ahhhh".<br />It is certainly refreshing and that is supported not only by medical people but by a friend of mine from India. So who you gonna believe, heh?<br />On a trip to India, while we were driving from Bangalore (now Bangalaroo) to Mysore, I noticed a lot of people stopping along side the road to buy coconuts from vendors. I asked my friend what that was all about. Did they like to eat coconuts THAT much?? He told me that they were stopping to get a refreshing drink to help them fight the effects of the heat. Coconut water gave them a good resistance to the heat and refreshed them. Intriguing, I thought at the time. But later on when I discovered the product made by Vita Coco all that discussion came flooding back to me. The amount of potassium is great compared to bananas. I DO get an uplifting feeling knowing that I'm not only getting a tasty drink (I like that 17 ounce size) but it has such great benefits of refreshment during the hot season.<br />CHEERS!!

review/summary: Great stuff in a problematic container
review/text: This coconut water is superior to any other that includes sugar. Period. I've tried "80% coconut water", "83%" etc. but they're just too sweet to savor the fresh coconut taste. This is the closest I've tasted to something right out of the coconut. It's slightly sour, as the real thing is.<br /><br />Problem is, if you don't use a straw - I prefer not to so I can easily re-seal the pack - the design of the pack leaves some water sloshing around at the end which is hard to get at without using a straw, cutting open the pack, or trying to bounce it out the opening. Which is really annoying, considering the thought of missing even a sip of this stuff.<br /><br />It's pricier than a lot of other options, but when you just have to have the sensation of drinking coconut water, you have few alternatives. Get the subscription and save a few bucks.

review/text: Vita Coco has a very different taste than you'd normally expect from coconut juice.  If you buy the Amy and Brian brand (which I also like BTW) and compare the two, you'll see that Vita Coco isn't as sweet and doesn't have that "flowery aroma" to it.  This is because Vita Coco uses coconuts harvested from Brazil while Amy and Brian use coconuts harvested from Thailand.  I especially like Vita Coco though because the taste is so refreshing and non-distracting...  I feel like I can drink it all day!  The Amy and Brian brand is sweeter and more syrupy so I only drink that on occasion.

review/summary: Delicious - Always Came Fresh
review/text: I noticed that a few customers have had a bad experience with the freshness and delivery. I am not denying anyone's trust of their tastebuds. However, I would be remiss if I did not state that I have always received these fresh and delightful-tasting. They have never been delivered broken, as I have ordered 4 cases to-date. I actually prefer the flavor of these to O.N.E. brand. Although O.N.E. are quite tasty, VitaCoco are a little bit sweeter, on average. Lest we forget these are fresh from coconuts; none will taste the exact same. And the resealable 17+ oz. boxes boost its "star power" in my review. I drink them when I go to the gym. They rehydrate me much better than purified or spring water, and come in a resealable container, making them ergonomical for the gym, too. Sports drinks cannot even be compared, with their sticky, fructose-mouth feel. I always longed to find something that hydrates better than water alone and without the sticky, sugary taste in my mouth and heavy feeling in my stomach like sports drinks leave behind. VitaCoco does just that. It has 5 electrolytes, namely Potassium, which has been suggested to help prevent muscle cramping...pretty big benefit during physical exertion, would we say?!<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend VitaCoco coconut water. For me, these are just what the doctor ordered.

review/summary: Hangover CURE
review/text: This handy dandy drink-a-doo is the hangover CURE. I figured this out when I purchased this product at a gas station on the way to a weekend get away. Late at night/in the wee hours of the morning, I remembered this when I was oh-so-thirsty and downed the whole thing before I went to bed along with a glass of water. I was amazed at the rate of recovery and rehydration the next day. It was amazing and is now my go-to cure. Right on Vita Coco...right on.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I heard how hydrating coconut water is and started reading reviews. Vita Coco is a bit more expensive and Amy and Brian's had a lot of good reviews so I enrolled in auto delivery. I wasn't happy with it so I switched to Vita Coco per my daughter's advice.<br /><br />I'm on my first batch, so far so good. Hope I don't encounter a bad batch as I can imagine it must be tough to do an exchange.<br /><br />Update: Still loving it and am now also on the auto delivery for the 11 oz as well. The 17 oz is easy to drink from but the 11 oz is just right for me to drink walking to my yoga class, just use a straw. If I only had room in my fridge I would also get the 34 oz.

review/summary: Horrible packaging and taste
review/text: I'm not sure what the company was thinking when they packaged these; over half of mine arrived leaking.  Then--to make matters worse--the ones that weren't opened tasted horrible...way too sweet and just 'off'.  I ordered other brands and am MUCH happier with the packaging, taste, and value.  I will never reorder this again.

review/summary: Taste not good
review/text: I have ordered VITA coconut water 17oz pack and the taste was pretty bad. Most of the bottles smell and taste stale. Couple of the bottles were decent but not as good as ZICO or ONE. I have tasted ONE and ZICO coconut water before and they taste pretty much the same and I like them a lot. So I am going to stick with these two brands for now.

review/summary: Product and Shipping Do Not Meet Expectation
review/text: I ordered three 12-packs so there were three shipping package for my order. The first two 12 packs came ontime as expected. However, one of the bottom have mole growing out of it so it have to be thrown away.<br /><br />The third product made it to my city and then return to the supply. Then it was reship to me next day (free of charge from Amazon). However, I only received 8 packs instead of the 12 packs.<br /><br />The product quality is pretty lousy compared to other coconut juice products I tried. I figure that I give this one a try. It look like somebody went through and open up all the box which made me afraid to drink it sometimes.<br /><br />The taste really do not taste like real coconut. I expect more from 100% coconut. It was pretty cheap to begin with but I think that I would go with other products.

review/summary: Beware of NEW ingredients.
review/text: I recently contacted Amazon and Vita Coco, due to the new nasty taste. I thought I had gotten a bad batch and literally poured all of them down the drain. Amazon was great and sent a replacement free of charge and I received it the very next day. But no luck, same nasty taste. After a little bit of researching found out that they decided for whatever reason to add new ingredients. Why?. Anyways, The taste with the NEW ingredients is nothing more than a mixture of water/sugar/vinegar, and it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. So dissapointed. I cancelled my subscription because it not longer tastes like real coconut water, and threw the second shipment I received away!

review/text: I really the original Vita Coco, without any other flavors added. My last shipment was wrong! I received the one with Pineapple added to it which I have tried and do not like. It seems that when Amazon runs out of a product they just send you whatever they have available. This is second time I get the wrong item and the second time I've had cancel a subscription. I don't think this review will make it to the public as the last one I wrote was not posted because Amazon doesn't want any negative reviews about them! Hopefully, someone will contact me in order to correct this issue @ yaninatz@yahoo.com as I have emailed them regarding this problem.

review/summary: I like this coconut water
review/text: I enjoy Vita Coco coconut water.  I prefer the version with pineapple, but this one is pretty good too.  The flavor is light and fresh, especially when it is well chilled.  I ordered two packs (24 boxes), and so far they all taste the same among themselves and as compared to 1 liter boxes that I purchased from Costco and as the same size boxes that I purchased from Ralph's, so I have not yet encountered flavor variations some other reviewers complained about.<br /><br />The flavor of this coconut water is definitely much lighter than the fresh coconut water I drank straight from a coconut at a Thai restaurant, so depending on what you are expecting you may or may not like Vita Coco.<br /><br />My only complaint is the price, which is not low.  This was a good deal as a Gold Box item on Subscribe and Save; however, the regular price is as high or higher than what I saw it at a local grocery chain.

review/summary: Do Not Buy
review/text: I've had real coconut water straight from a young coconut.  This is not real coconut water.<br /><br />First of all, this is sourced from Brazilian coconuts.  This type of coconut is inherently bitter and not as sweet as coconut from Thailand.<br /><br />With that said, this coconut tastes worse than it should.<br /><br />I've purchased this from Costco and amazon.com they seem to have quality control issues.  Some bottles were more bitter and past freshness despite the fact that they add sugar to normalize their product.<br /><br />That brings up another issue.  This product is labelled "pure coconut water," but they add sugar to it.  Two words:  false advertising.<br /><br />Do not buy this product.

review/text: I haven't been drinking coconut water for very long, but, I have tasted nearly every bottled brand out there and as of this review, this brand tastes as close to natural coconut as I have come. There is also another brand but I will write a similar review for that one.<br /><br />This can be drunk at room temperature or chilled and to me it still tastes delicious. As I have a hard, very, very hard time drinking regular water I always turn to coconut water. It has the balance I want of being natural and not having artificial sugars. It's taken me many years to get to this point and I am sticking here for a long time.

review/summary: Great product and service, but did not work for me.
review/text: I read some of the reviews and could not figure why this product or service got negative reviews.<br /><br />I bought Vita Coco in stores several times and liked everything about it.  Reminded me about the taste of a fresh coconut when I growing up in South India.  There was nothing more refreshing than drinking coconut water in the summer months in South India.  Yes, just like there bad coconuts, the coconut water can also be bad sometimes.  In nearly 50 packaged and several 100 natural coconuts, I can probably count the number of time I had sour coconut water.  Unfortunately the Amazon.com order was one of them.<br /><br />Now to the service.  After I mentioned this to Amazon, they sent me a second order FREE of charge.  To my bad luck the second order was from the same batch (11279P) as the first one and tasted as sour as the first.  If you look at the package, it is sealed so there is no way for Amazon to tell what batch they are sending.  It is much like in retail a store (buy something, if it is defective return or exchange it).<br /><br />Long story short, as mentioned in the first line, I still don't understand some of the negative review about the product and service.

I've used it in smoothies (the flavor is too mild to add much and it's too expensive to waste that way); but it's best cold, with nothing added.  I tear the plastic cap from the cardboard bottle and burn the cardboard, so there's not much left for the recycling bin.  It's not easy to find in stores (and usually it's in singles), so I was pleased to locate it on Amazon.

review/text: I ordered a case of these right when the whole coconut water craze began.  Took awhile to receive my order, but when it did come, it came in a well packaged box and in good condition.  I put a couple in the fridge and looked foward to trying.  It only took a couple sips to be sure that the taste was disgusting.  It may be good for you, but it sure isn't mouth-watering.  I have tried some of the flavored coconut waters and they are much better.  Unless you already enjoy basic coconut water, I would recommend trying a flavored version instead.  I ordered the 12 pack a year ago and still have half of them left.  (They do work well if mixed with other juices.)

review/summary: A Good Chew
review/text: Our shih tzu Piper had dental surgery to remove four broken teeth. Her dental surgeon vet blamed hard chew treats for the broken teeth. In hindsight some of the chews were so hard that I had to use a saw to cut them in half for sharing between the two dogs. The vet advised us to use the bend test. If the chew isn't flexible, don't give it to your dog.<br /><br />The Nylabone Healthy Edible passes the bend test. Looking at the bone-shaped treat, one would think it is a hard object and a long lasting chew. Piper and Gabby both like these chews. Depending on the dog, these treats can be long lasting without jeapardizing the teeth of the dog.<br /><br />Being a spudophile, I'm pleased that ingredient number four is potato starch. Despite the Nylabone name, these chews contain no plastic. Also lacking are sugar, salt, preservatives, and gluten. The ingredients are natural and it is edible and highly digestible as advertised. Our pooches give the American made Healthy Edibles their barks of approval.

review/summary: treat not a chew bone
review/text: These are great as a treat, but not as a chew. They are so well liked they don't last. What I can't understand is why a seller that offers Amazon Prime charges albout 3 to 4 times the cost that other prime sellers are charging for the same items and think they will make a profit. I guess it's buyer beware and be a bargain shopper if you don't want to seriously overpay.

review/summary: Made my dog throw up bad
review/text: Our 14 lb Mini Schnauzer easily started splintering this bone in a matter of minutes and being an 'ever hungry' dog he just swallowed these pieces. Seeing this I took the bone away after he ate about a third of it. Less than 24 hrs later when it was time for his breakfast at 7:30 AM (his standard time) he refused to eat! This was the first time he ever refused to break his overnight fast!! But after a few minutes the hunger must have gotten the better of him; he gave in and ate almost all of it (usually he cleans up his little bowl) and about an hour later he threw up all of it in FOUR rounds of puking!<br /><br />I could see small, softened yet still relatively firm pieces of this Healthy Edible "bone" in his vomit. What a shame I went for this thinking it would be a great alternative to feeding my dog indigestible nylon.

review/summary: Why Is Peach Water So Hard To Find?
review/text: Why would you buy bottled water on Amazon?  Because peach water seems to be harder to find than gold.  I don't understand it, I can walk into any grocery store or Costco and find grape water, strawberry-kiwi water, berry water, etc. but peach water is a whole different thing, it's harder to find than Sasquatch!<br /><br />This Fruit2O water is good, and tastes pretty much what you'd expect peach flavored water to taste like.  Refreshing and light.  My dad is addicted to this stuff and of course it drives my mother mad since it's so hard to find.  Bottom line, if you find some of this stuff in the wild stock up on it and let me know where you got it!  Thanks!!

review/summary: Yummy Stuff
review/text: I use this to replicate a Vietnamese curry I grew up with:<br /><br />To a large pot add the following:<br /><br />1 can of Karee Curry Paste with 1 can (14 oz) of coconut milk, 2-3 cups water, 3lbs of chicken, 2 large or 3 medium potatoes (cut to bite-sized cubes) and 2-3 carrots (same as potatoes), 1 large onion (cut into quarters), and a few whole jalepenos (remove the stem).  You can also add a stick of lemongrass.  You can also substitute coconut milk with regular milk, and eggplant for the chicken (veggie option).<br /><br />Bring to boil then simmer for 20-30 minutes.  Add corn starch to bring the soup to its desired consistency. I like it thicker and stew-like.  Salt+MSG to taste.  You will need MSG to bring the flavor out - I use 1 part MSG per 1 part salt.<br /><br />Server over rice or with french bread.  You can spritz in some lime (my parents always do) but I like it without the lime.<br /><br />I'm lazy so this does end up over cooking the chicken a bit, but it ensures the potatoes and carrots are soft and mushy the way I like them - plus no extra steps.  Make sure the water covers the chicken.  Chicken breast seems to dry out, leg quarters stay tender.  If you use eggplant I like to use larger chunks (1.5" or so) since they tend to mush up  a bit.<br /><br />Anyways I love this curry paste.  I would get "curry pangs" and have to make this every couple weeks while I was in college.  So easy to do and it would feed me for a few days.

I had never used duck fat before, but the reviews sounded promising........ and now I am SO glad that I bought the 3-pack because I want to use this product often.  The first time I used it I was amazed at how the aroma filled the air. Right away too.  My potatoes came out nicely browned and the flavor was wonderful.  I had no idea using "fat" could be so great for my cooking.  It's absolutely delicious for just about anything you can think of to cook in it. Turkey legs rubbed with this before baking them is a winner, as well as searing a pan-fried steak on the stove top.  It simply adds an enhanced flavor to my food. What a neat surprise Rougie Duck Fat has been for me.  Thanks Amazon--I am so glad I found this product through you. I'm looking forward to using it for many more ideas.

review/text: Thank goodness for a wonderful combination:  Cloud Star Buddy Biscuits & Amazon.com!  I was overjoyed on the day I discovered I could purchase such a wonderful product like Cloud Star's Veggie Madness Buddy Biscuits in a 6-pack from Amazon.com.  My 12-year-old red sesame Shiba Inu has been enjoying the regular-sized Veggie Madness Buddy Biscuits for years.  As he has slowed down in his senior years, I've been challenged with curbing his insatiable appetite for the regular-sized Buddy Biscuits.  Cloud Star Itty Bitty Veggie Madness Buddy Biscuits are the perfect solution!  These little 1-inch treats are great for playing games, for rewarding when cutting finger & toe nails, and for giving a treat when you'd prefer not to break a larger treat into pieces.  If you want to give your furry little child a wholesome & healthy treat, I strongly recommend Cloud Star's Buddy Biscuits in both sizes.

review/text: I understand the need for high quality and craftmanship with these tea bags, but they are just plain poorly designed.  While other companies are making tea bags that don't soak up water, ones that drain more easily, and otherwise, Kusmi still has these tea bags that suck up water and drip everywhere.  You cannot leave your bag in the cup, as the water will seep up the rope and drip all over whatever the tea is on.  It is very, very annoying.<br /><br />Otherwise, though, Anastasia is the best of Kusmi's tea.  And they make amazingly high quality, great-tasting tea.  I am a huge tea snob and I balk at paying so much for a box of tea, but it is worth it, as it is really fantastic, taste-wise.  I just wish they'd redesign their tea bags!

review/text: First of all, the other reviews here are not entirely fair. Why take off a couple of stars for not noticing the (clearly marked) 20 tea bags per box? This is really unfair to the quality of the tea itself, and this is fantastic tea! Although I prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001K5LOY">Kusmi Kashmir Tchai</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001K5LNK">Kusmi Bouquet de Fleurs</a> slightly more, Anastasia is a good place to start enjoying Kusmi tea. I like all of these teas best with just a little sugar, no milk. If you enjoy Earl Grey, you really owe it to yourself to try some of the Kusmi blends.<br /><br />Regarding the price, this is gourmet tea (and there are cheaper places to buy these teas). At any rate, at around 50 cents per cup, this is much less expensive and more delicious than what you are spending at the cafe. My office neighbor drinks a can of that Arizona junk every day. That must cost over a dollar each, and it is garbage tea! I keep a box or two of this and other Kusmi teas in my office and it is well worth the price for the afternoon pickup.

Yet this is certainly the BEST TRAIL MIX assortment I have ever tried....for various reasons. Good quality ingredients....and everything is easy to pop in your mouth and chew. I think since all items are smaller than many mixes, this is helpful. Some trail mixes tend to be tasty, but too abrasive to chew. I despise getting stabbed in the gum with a sharp nut or chipping a filling on a fruit chunk that's hard as a piece of gravel.....  No worries with this tasty and efficient mix. Its nice to keep in the car for snacking....and it's great in hot oatmeal for breakfast.

I bought it to share with family members who have dairy and nut allergies, but everyone dug right in, and went back for more. It's a light mix, very flavorful, and just right for snacking or enjoying with a casual meal. Some people in our party even put it on top of their fruit salad.<br /><br />A few other reviewers mentioned splitting it up into six separate containers, and that's what we did, even though we served one whole bag of it at once: we split it into six small glass dishes and let everyone dish his own with tablespoons. I think splitting it up does keep the mixture just right, without letting the heavier seeds settle to the bottom.<br /><br />A lot of trail mixes get stuck in your teeth, and I have to say, that was not a problem with this one. Whether allergies are in your life or not, I highly recommend this mix.<br /><br />I only wish it were organic. (Then I would give it five stars.)

review/summary: Difficult for small children
review/text: This trail mix tastes wonderful!  I dont recommend it for small children though.  I bought this for my kids that have food allergies.  The pieces are way to small for small children.  They have a hard time picking up the pieces.

review/summary: LOVE IT!!
review/text: I love this trail mix!  I have Celiac disease so I cannot eat gluten...but I'm also allergic to tree nuts.  Due to all of that, it is hard to find nice filling snacks that are easy to take with me.  When I found this I was in heaven!!  But then my local health food store stopped carrying it.  I'm soooo excited I can get it on here.  Like another review said, I divide my package up into 5-6 servings...because it is soooo easy to just finish off the bag in a very short amount of time.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who has food allergies (because Enjoy Life foods are COMPLETELY free of the 8 most common allergens and some others besides), and anyone who just plain likes trail mix but doesn't want nuts.  ENJOY!!

review/summary: Nacho Doritos...yum!
review/text: I think nacho Doritos are my favorite snack in the chip category. The 50 mini bags are perfect in that you don't risk the large-size bag from going stale. The mini bags are also great for bag lunches, or snacking at anytime.

review/summary: fresh and plenty
review/text: this seller sent me fresh beautiful curry leaves. very arromatic and lovely and there were lots of them. i appreciate the effort the seller put in to send these wonderful leaves to me so quickly. i want to make turnip wraps and need curry leaves. i grew up in Tennessee and moved to New Jersey. because of this i know southern foods and my pastas and sauces will make you sing opera, but i want to learn Indian food because i live in Wyoming now and there isnt access to "exotic" foods and ingredients, and honestly there is nothing like a beautiful spicy hot curry on a cold night=thank God for Amazon and great sellers like this one! i can now make the turnip wraps  have been dying to try, i got the recipe from cookingchanel.com Bal Arneson, she's so pretty and happy who wouldnt want to try her recipies.
