review/summary: Firm stool
review/text: Following a year with my adopted 8 year old Persian mix and his incredibly loose stool, three weeks after adding Mr. Newman's to his diet he has a firm stool. We tried Science Diet IM and WD a combination of wet  and dry.  I continue to  feed him the WD dry with a 1/3 of a can Newman's twice a day. Not that this cat is a picky eater but he cleans the bowl with Newmans and he always left a bit behind with ID. My cat is happier and I am  so happy that his obligatory butt cleaning scoots have ended.

review/summary: all three cats love it
review/text: My cats think this food is the cat's meow.  I think that cats who have been fed grocery-store-type foods that have added ingredients, some completely artificial, might need some time to adjust to the natural taste.  But my cats have only been fed higher quality food--most recently before trying Newman's Own they were exclusively eating Doctors Foster and Smith foods.  Even though Foster's is completely natural, it is not organic which is why I've switched.  It's a good feeling to know that I'm doing everything I can to give my cats health and long lives (my Siamese is 21).

review/summary: If You Love Your Cat
review/text: The results we have had since we switched to Newman's Own Pet food are phenomenal. All of our pets look and act younger, their coats are shiny, their noses are wet, and they have a bounce to their step. All natural and healthy ingredients seem to suit them as well, before Newman's many of our pets where picky eaters. Now we have no trouble making sure they get their daily quota of healthy food.

review/summary: Different Consistency
review/text: We have 6 cats and 2 dogs presently and they all get Newman's Own Organics.  The only one we have had our cats walk away from is the 3 oz can of Turkey Formula for cats.  They love the 5.5 oz. can of Turkey and the other two selections.  They also love the 3 oz. chicken and salmon.  The only difference besides the size of the cans is that in the middle of the turkey formula 3 oz. cans there is now a dark pink or reddish colored spot(that was not there originally) that is not in the 5.5 oz can.  All the other dry and can food varieties are very nutritious and are eaten very quickly.

review/summary: confused about this product
review/text: I ordered this product knowing that my cat loves Newman's Organic Turkey formula.  However, he refuses to eat it, and I am concerned that there is something wrong with this batch. I have offered it to him over a several week period thinking he would change his mind, but no luck.  I usualy have good luck ordering from Amazon, but this time I am totally frustrated not being able to speak to anyone.  I would donate the case to an animal shelter, but I am afraid that it could hurt the animals.  You see....I unknowingly fed another pet bad canned food a number of years ago, and there was eventually a recall.  Later she had health problems, and I believe it damaged her kidneys.  It was, in fact, a high quality pet food, so one never knows.

review/summary: Newman's Own
review/text: My cat eats well and has good digestion.  Last spirng I switched her from Science Diet to Orijen, which had been recommended to me by the owner of one of those fancy pet stores in downtown LA.  He said the it was low in carbohidrates and all natural. Within months she began bleeding.  I took her to the vet who recommended that I start feeding her plain canned turkey cat food until they could find out what was going on, which I did.  That episode costs me $600.00.  After a course of antibiotics I went back to Orijen and she immediately started bleeding again so I threw the Orijen out.  I started with Newman's Own six months ago and have never looked back.  My cat is happy with the food and there is no sign of blood anywhere.  I recommend Newman's Own.

review/summary: Watch for dented cans. I will re-rate this product later
review/text: The last 3 cases I've ordered had some dented cans located in the center of the case. I've read other coplaints about this also and wanted to warn potential buyers. The problem is not with amazon but with the manufacturer and how the cans are selected to be stocked inside the cardboard flats. I keep ordering for convenience and love Amazon. My cat loves the product and it is hard to find locally or stocked in a store far away. I sift through every case to make sure the seal hasn't been broken on any dented cans and usually throw away a few. My next case arrives in about a week. If it is dent free, I will revise my review and rating.

review/summary: Inconsistent in product quality
review/text: This is my fist batch from amazon of the salmon and chicken formula. Purchase 3 cases from another pet food store and our cat loved it. When we opened this new one from Amazon, it didn't smell the same as the last batch, this one smelled like rotten fish and the last one smelled good. We have tried to give this new one to our cat and he refused to eat it (when he would beg for the other one and finish it promptly). I inspected both a can from this new batch and a can from the old batch and everything is the same including all ingredients. The only difference I could find was the older batch had a 2014 date on the bottom printed a little differently from the 2015 best by date the the new one....? I don't understand why this product has such inconsistent quality or maybe Newman's is not making the same quality product as they used to. Too bad since I would like to find a organic cat food that is not super expensive cause I'm not going to buy this one again.

review/text: I am very happy with this product. Not only is it organic without any by-products but my 2 older cats love it! I bought a case shipped and sold by Amazon LLC so I got free shipping and a good price. Unfortunately when I tried to buy another case the next month Amazon was investigating a problem they were having with the shipping or something and so I am going to have to look elsewhere for my Newmann's Own cat food until they resolve the issue. I am pretty sad about that but otherwise the cat food is great!

review/summary: I wish this worked with our little darlings!
review/text: I do all the research before buying pet food.  I had high hopes that this one would work with out kibble eating cats as one of them needed to eat food containing more moisture as well as healthy ingredients.  When I opened the first can it smelled and looked good.  I was confident our cats would scarf it up and beg for more.  No way.  They made dainty little burying movements and then walked away.  All I could think of was how much I had spent for such puny results.  Now we are back to using the top grade of kibble and Fancy Feast, which our cats will eat.  However, the good news is that everyone we gave some to from the first case reported back that their cats loved it and they were going to keep using it.  Fancy Feast is cheaper so that is good, but I have no idea what is in the product.  I just trust that our cats are getting enough moisture.  I do regret that we are not using  Newman's Own product since I like their philosophy.

review/summary: Almost a 5
review/text: I love the can size. I can use one per day rather than covering and refrigerating for the next day.  It is great because this food is supposed to go to the cat at room temperature.  Unfortunately,  I believe I checked when I was considering changing to these smaller cans and found that they are more expensive for the amount my cat eats per day than the larger cans.  The only reason I don't give this product a 5 can be remedied by either Newman's Own or Amazon.  I am a prime member but since subscribe and save does not use prime I have to double order.  There are 24 cans so prime once a month (regular shipping time vs. 2 day prime makes it longer than once a month) won't keep my cat feed for the month.  I don't understand why subscribe and save does not honor prime membership.  When customers choose subscribe and save they are giving Amazon long-term consistent business. I guess if Newman's Own packed 40 or 48 cans it would work better with subscribe and save.

review/summary: Cats like it
review/text: I have two Siamese kittens who are on a mostly all canned food diet. The Chicken & Salmon formula is one of the foods in their current rotation. They seem to really enjoy eating it, although I wouldn't say it's their favorite food. You can see bits of the ingredients (rice?) in the food, and the texture is not too firm, but certainly more firm than a pate-style food. I have already ordered my second case, and plan to order more in the future. These 5.5 oz cans fit the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084E66">Petmate Kitty-Kap Can Cover</a> quite well.

review/summary: I loved that it was organic! My cat- not so much...
review/text: I purchased the Chicken & Salmon formula with the notion that- Hey! I watch what I eat, My kitty should too! Needless to say, my cat Mia was less than thrilled. In fact, she took two wiffs and walked away :( Granted I was feeding her Fancy Feast before- which I recently found out is like feeding your cat Mcdonald's every day! Super tasty but void of any nutritional benefits whats-soever... So after a few unsuccessful meal times, I tried spiking her meal with a dash of Fancy Feast? No dice. She ate the Fancy Feast and I swear gave me this look like- 'Nice Try Bucco- and you thought you were SOOO sneaky...'<br /><br />So to the previous Fancy Feast feeders- I say maybe try something else to slowly get your cat onto the health track? Or you might end up like me with 20 cans of food I can't use :( I've been trying other brands that have more gravy- with slightly more success! (Emphasis on the slightly-she drinks up all the liquid and I'm left with chicken strips!) Maybe I have a oober picky cat? But I'm thinking I will keep on trying and probably give this one another run once I've detoxed her from her fast food craves..

review/summary: Best Choice for my Cats
review/text: I tried literally everything, from high end to low end, before settling on Newman's Own.  The reason?  All of my 5 cats enjoy the flavor (organic turkey) and come running when it is time to eat.  I feed them Newman's Own organic dry cat food as well, so their diet is about half and half.  I have one cat that suffers from IBS. She has to take prednisone daily, so I'm hoping the change in food will improve her condition.  Though Newman's products are expensive, I believe the organic ingredients will make a big difference in my cats' overall health, which in turn will mean fewer trips to the vet and more money in my pocket.  Besides that, I love the fact that there is strict quality control and oversight in everything that goes into a can or a bag, and all the proceeds from the sale of Newman's Own pet food are donated back to animal shelters and the SPCA.  No profit to me means that this company really does have the cats' welfare at heart.

review/summary: Super Finicky Cat Loves It!
review/text: This is for the Chicken & Brown Rice Canned Cat Food Formula<br /><br />My cat (now 15 yrs old) has always been a picky eater.  The only cat food he would eat consistently was Whiskas canned cat food. But alas, they discontinued that product line, switching to pouches and tubs (both of which he refuses to eat).  He will eat 9 Lives from time to time, but it gives him gas and appears to be high in fat (based on the pool of fat when can is dumped out in dish).  I have desperately tried numerous brands and flavors of cats foods for a number of years, but to no avail (Some brands and flavors I could get him to eat for a day or two, but then he refuses to eat it any longer).<br /><br />Then I came across Newman's Organic Chicken & Brown Rice at Dillon's Grocery (owned by Krogers) during a stay in Hutchinson, Kansas and he LOVES IT!  And, it appears to be fairly low in fat, which is a huge plus for an elderly cat with liver troubles (he currently has to be given Denosyl, which is also available on Amazon, to keep his liver in check).<br /><br />For those unaware, a cat with liver troubles is recommended to receive a low fat, low sodium diet, with no fish meal and no organ meat.  I've read online that vets recommend chicken and brown rice blended cat food. So, while I dont know exactly how much sodium, fat, and organ meat this product has (ingredients do list chicken liver, ocean whitefish, and sea salt), it appears to fit the bill (Ie: it doesnt have a pool of liquid fat when put in the dish) and so far my cat is doing well on this product (at long as I continue to medicate him with Denosyl, due to his liver disease - which helps protect the liver and keep the bile production down to a minimum).<br /><br />Unlike most other canned cat foods, he eats the entire can and begs for another!  Today he's eaten every bite of FIVE of the small 3oz sized cans!<br /><br />Ounce to ounce, it's a little more expensive than some canned cat foods, but well worth it in my opinion, especially since none of it is going to waste (whereas with other brands I have been going through 3-5 5oz cans of the other brands of cat food, twice a day - morning meal and evening meal - simply to find one that he will eat and then he only eats 1/2 to 2/3 of one of them for each meal, which makes for up to 9 wasted 5 oz cans a day!).  So, in the long run it's cheaper for me at least, and no headaches of trying to get him to eat something.<br /><br />I'm am extremely happy with the product and my cat is very happy with it as well.

review/text: Product Basics: My cat loves this stuff, although I only serve it once a week.  It's fairly consistent from can to can; to date, I've only opened one can that was "watery"-ish.  The texture is usually very thick and solid.<br /><br />Product Received, including Packaging & Delivery: Since a case will last several months, I was pleased to see the expiration date was well in the future.  The product arrived in a small box, packed with airbags to protect the item - not glamorous, but efficient.  The box was slightly dinged on one corner; one of the airbags had broken from the impact, but the product was protected.  No cans were damaged.  Delivery was quicker than I anticipated (took about a week).<br /><br />Amazon Experience: Amazon makes it easy to order this stuff; I've even arranged for automatic shipping (you can speed up or delay the next shipment, if you're worried about timing).  This is the best price I've found for this product.  Overall, I would buy this product from Amazon, again.

review/text: I went back and forth on getting my girls some of the beef flavored Newmans because 2 of the 3 can't eat chicken.  I am always looking for a good quality food to add to their rotation.  There was a pretty good sale on the beef flavored a few days ago so I bought it.  I opened a can to give them for their dinner and I absolutely could not give that to my girls!  It had an awful grey color to it and was the consistency of wall paper paste.  My cats like to chew their food not lick it up so I knew they would have an awful time with this one.  Newman's has changed.  I have tried most of the flavors over the years and I have noticed that the cans are underweight and seem to have almost as much rice as pate in them.  Will not be buying again but thank heaven for Amazon that always makes it right without any hassles.

review/summary: Great Purchase
review/text: My husband was given a lovely Breville coffee machine for his birthday.  He is very fond of flavored coffees, so this was an excellent gift.  The Gloria Jean Hazelnut is one of his favorite flavors.  We purchased a large supply through Amazon.  The delivery was prompt.  As soon as this supply has been used, we will repeat the order.

review/summary: Great taste, only hesitation is sucralose.
review/text: This V8 Pomegranaate Blueberry energy drink is pretty tasty. We do not drink these sorts of things every day. This particular size (8 fl oz.) has only 50 calories along with the juices of carrots, sweet potatoes, blueberries, pomegranates with green tea. There is caffeine in this drink from the green tea that is a sizable 80 mg.<br /><br />It claims to be a great source of anti-oxidants and a full serving of fruit and veg. The one bummer is the sucralose. That is one reason why we wouldn't have this often. Though the sucralose is far down on the list of ingredients, I would rather have a natural sugar.<br /><br />I wouldn't be opposed to having this once in a great while, as it tasted pretty good. Also, other than the sucralose, it has great things in it that contribute caffeine in a much better way than pop (or soda).

review/text: V8 Pomegranate and Blueberry Fusion Drink<br /><br />I liked it. Smaller can so its not high calorie. It says energy buy its no added caffeine or sugar just natural fruit juice for a little boost. I love pomegranate and the blueberry adds just the right amount of sweetness. Not too tart not too sweet - well balanced. Nice change up and if you like Pom/blueberry :).  I bought a 64 ounce afterward because I did enjoy it.

review/summary: Refreshing and healthy drink
review/text: I was delighted to receive this new V8 drink as I've been a fan of V8 for a long time as it not only is healthy, but it tastes really good.  I don't know if it gives more energy because how does one measure that?  But, blueberries and pomegranate have been proven to be very healthy fruits and the low calorie count is an added plus.  I will be going to my local supermarket to get more of this new drink instead of my usual juice.

review/summary: Nicely fused
review/text: I love the liquid combo of pomegranate and blueberry, and V8's version is probably healthier than most because it contains ten grams of sugar in an eight-ounce can. I'm not saying that's a low amount of sugar, but it's probably lower than the sugar content within most brands, which taste much sweeter (and, regrettably, a bit better than this stuff). V-Fusion drinks typically have a sweet, fruity taste, yet you can always catch the hint of vegetable mix within.<br /><br />Like all V8 products, this can of V-Fusion is loaded with good stuff: a combined serving of fruit and vegetables; green tea extract; and lots of vitamins. It's labeled as an energy drink and contains a caffeine level of eighty milligrams, just ten less than an eight-ounce cup of coffee. Weirdly enough, after drinking a can of V-Fusion at night after a long day, I didn't feel energized in the least (maybe because I'm a coffee drinker and immune to "natural caffeine" that comes from green tea extract). At any rate, this is a good, healthy drink that would be a nice alternative to other overly sweet fruit drinks. I'd recommend it, along with V-8's other Fusion concoctions.

review/summary: Dangerously Delicious Amount But Didn't Seem as Fresh As Store
review/text: So I had a bad car wreck at the first of November and had a closed head injury. I wasn't in my right mind and ordered 18 pounds of Gummi Bears much to my husband's concern. I basically lived on these and sweet tea, and I probably have diabetes now but oh well. Thank You Haribo. I would find myself in the middle of my living room drooling for God knows how long mindlessly stuffing these sweet little creations in my pie hole before someone would lead me to a chair, bed or toilet.<br /><br />I've read about the sugar free gummis giving people gas and intestinal issues. Well, you ain't seen nothing yet. I think anytime you ingest copious amounts of gelled items you are in for gas and runny poops, but what do I care? I was totally out of my mind.<br /><br />Keep them in a air tight container (even if they are in a sealed package). I've found them not to be as deliciously scented as the 3 pound bag I buy at the store, but they were still good. They tasted fresh and were soft like they should have been, but it's also possible my sense of smell and taste were affected.<br /><br />This is a  good amount for a party or to make little gift bags, but good luck trying to eat all these by yourself. It's a good price. These came directly from Haribo, and they got here in a day or two.

review/summary: 5 stars for flavor, less for packaging
review/text: Haribo has the most flavorful Gummi Bears around, I'm totally addicted to them. I bought this 12 pound package (4 3lb bags) and, while the product itself is delicious, the way I received it left much to be desired. This is a gelatin based product, meaning it melts. I live in Arizona and ordered this towards the end of August. Bad timing on my part, so I found out. These 4 packages are simply shipped in the original cardboard box. There is no packing material. It was 98 degrees the day these were delivered - actually rather mild for Arizona August - but this box must have been right up against the side of the UPS truck, the inside of the truck was oven-like. I know this, because I took the box from the driver, promptly opened it up, and what I had were 4 mushy, melty, HOT gummi bears. The packages on both ends of the box were literally each 1/2 full of very stuck together gummis, and 1/2 full of one big blob of melted-together, indistinguishable bears. The two middle packages were more or less okay, just hot. The gummis that were still able to separate into individual bears were tasty as usual. The blob that I had to literally rip chunks off of to eat was tough, chewy, and the flavor was different.<br /><br />I normally wouldn't give a product fewer stars for a packaging issue - but this wasn't Amazon packing, it was the manufacturers box that was shipped. They should be aware that shipping in hot weather has an impact on these and there should have been packed with foam or packing peanuts or something to give insulation. I'll buy these again - just not from April to October in Phoenix.

review/summary: excelent value, not as "fresh" as some might want it
review/text: My 12 lbs (4x 3lbs) of gummy bear arrived yesterday. The candy comes in large(!) resale packaging. I opened up one package right away to check if there is a truth in the complain that many people seem to have with this product.<br />In short: yes, the candy tastes "older" than those small packages you can pick up from your local grocery store, but for me this is an advantage:<br />When I buy a package of gummy bears (and it has to be the Haribo brand), I open a package and let it sit for 2-4 weeks to "ripe". I can't stand the strong artificial taste/smell of fresh gummy candy products.<br />In my opinion, the longer the gold-bears can breeze, the better the taste gets. Plus, because they get harder to chew, you eat less of them.<br />I don't know yet what the perfect age for gummy-bears is, because once they get a couple weeks old and start tasting good they are suddenly all gone ;-(

Once they are open, they are open.  Have some air-tight containers ready to store extra gummis.  Otherwise, they will harden!

review/summary: The best Gummy Bears in the World
review/text: I love Haribo!!!!  In my opinion gummy bears should not be fruit snacks--they should be gummy bears: that unique taste and consistency which is found only in gummy bears.  Haribo gummy bears are hands down the best gummy bears on the planet because they are real gummy bears! They are not so soft and chewy like a fruit snack and they are not hard and sticky like Jujubes.  They are perfectly gummy and wonderful for any occasion!  I have been known to eat them before a long run as a quick energy boost, and I have friends who have even eaten them mid-run/bike for the same purpose.  They are great for desert, a study snack, a packed snack on a hike, or a nibble on a kayaking trip!  Yet another thing I like about Haribo is that they don't use High fructose corn syrup in their gummies.  Of course they do use plain corn syrup, but that is not nearly as bad for you--so, health-wise, Haribo gummy bears are not so bad a choice.  I would recommend Haribo to a friend any day and I would also recommend ordering through Amazon. The product arrived quickly and in excellent condition! . . . I think I am going to have a gummy bear right now ;)

review/text: I only write reviews when I really appreciate the quality of a product...as you can see from my previous reviews.  This is a great buy!  I'm the only girl working in an office of 9... I love all of our guys...they're like family..so I enjoy when they come by my desk and say hello.  The best part..is when they see a big basket filled with all their favorite candies.. their faces light up like little boys.  It's adorable..and very worth the price of this 5lb bag of candy.  I order 2 every time, and they last about a month.  Great Buy!

review/summary: You too can become a cook!
review/text: Potlucks can be stressful for some of us, but this pizza kit is so quick and easy to make.  Often I get the satisfaction of it being the first food to disappear, which totally makes it worth it. Adults and kids both like it.<br /><br />Hooray for organic and whole wheat! It has become a staple at our house, and we have even had people over to eat with us.  That's something we rarely ever did before.<br /><br />Not wanting to sound too corny, but it has changed my life.  I highly recommend it for everyone!<br /><br />Note:  Even if you don't have gluten issues, the gluten free version is also tasty.

review/text: My friends and I had a party surrounding trying this pizza kit.  We were delighted.  It really is simple, the parchment paper was splendid in assisting the process.  We made one thin and thick.  They both came out perfecto and tasted like it was thin crust or thick crust.  The sauce is very good, we were pleased to find it was not sugared up.  And though I thought I would never be a person to buy a pizza kit, I am already planning on order another.

review/text: This pizza is so easy to make and tastes way better than frozen.  I offered to make lunch for my coworkers and the night before began to regret my generosity.  I pulled out 2 GalloLea pizza kits at 9:00 and by 10:00 I had 4 freshly made pizzas ready to go.  We just heated them up in the oven the next day and everyone was amazed at my culinary skills.  The most popular one was the sweet potato and walnut that is suggested in the box.  Not a combo I would have come up with, but it was really good.  This pizza kit makes a great hostess gift too.

It is better than the do-it-yourself pizza crusts you can buy in grocery stores, plus it's organic and whole wheat, so I definitely prefer it.  No guilt pizza!!  The sauce is also the right amount of flavor, but doesn't dominate the pizza.  The directions were very easy to follow for anyone familiar with a measuring cup.

review/text: GalloLea Organic Pizza is the answer to disappointing frozen pizzas at home (I've yet to find one that suits my tastes). Since I prefer to eat organic whenever possible, that further limits the number of options for pizza at home. GalloLea Organic Pizza to the rescue! It's easy to make, contains only organic ingredients, and is made fresh not frozen. I like the fact that I can make the crust to just the right thickness, and it comes out perfect every time. The sauce has a perfect balance of sweet (not overly) tomato flavor and spices. Add some organic cheese and ingredients and in about the same time it takes for a frozen pizza to thaw and bake in the oven, I have a pizza that is not only healthy, but good enough to serve guests. Why didn't someone think of this sooner?

review/summary: Best Pizza Choice ON EARTH
review/text: Everyone loves pizza, and this pizza takes pizza to a whole new level, in so many ways.  The kits need no refrigeration yet contain all-organic and whole ingredients (the magic of vacuum packaging that seals out air).  Mixing the dough and transforming into proto-pizza on the provided parchment template is foolproof.  After you add the provided pizza sauce and YOUR choice of toppings, your creation is done in 20 minutes, faster than takeout, and tastes amazing.  The two pizzas the kit makes easily serve four, so on top of all this, you've also saved money vs. your local pizza parlor.  So glad that Asheville, NC and surrounds no longer has a monopoly on these pizzas!

review/text: Overall, the pizza turned out well.  I found that their 10 minute cook time would be accurate for a normal cheese pizza, but I loaded mine with tons of toppings so it took me nearly 20 minutes.  The crust came out great.  The sauce was pretty interesting too; slightly cinnamon flavored and sweet in my opinion.  Overall, for six bucks a pizza and prime shipping, you can't go wrong.  I will be ordering again in the future.

review/text: I've always made homemade pizza which took me hours from start to finish.  Enter GalloLea Organic Pizza Kit. Now, my family can enjoy delicious, wholesome pizza in no time at all.  The crust is easy to make, healthy and tastes great whether made thick or thin. An added bonus is the parchment paper included in the kit. Keeps the crust from sticking to the pan without having to use oil or shortening.  The sauce has just the right blend of spices and I top it with a variety of cheeses and vegetables.  A favorite in our house is mozzarella and parmesan cheeses with green peppers and onions.  I also like ricotta cheese with a little pesto, sundried tomatoes and pine nuts. The combinations are endless.

This is the case for most of Teavana's teas, when your in the store they waft the smell of the tea toward you and your like WOW I bet that tastes amazing.... then you later taste it and its only ok... The Earl gray is not very traditional compared to other teas like Twinings and Harriods... Being from London and growing up on earl gray this tea is not horrible but there are better teas out there. Its seems like an American twist on an English classic, but if your like me and like that traditional English taste, this is not the way to go.

review/summary: I want to like them... but I don't.
review/text: I was excited to see gluten free ravioli available, so I ordered these though Amazon, since I couldn't find them locally.  They were shipped fast, possibly overnight (sorry, I can't remember), with ice, and they were still frozen upon arrival, so that was comforting to know since I was a little hesitant to buy something frozen online.<br /><br />However, when I cook them, most of the raviolis lose their filling!  Tonight, I cooked 6 and only one still had the filling.  That was pretty disappointing.  Also, they had a funny flavor, and I'm still not sure if it was the pasta or the filling, and I added a pretty flavorful sauce that should have covered up a minor strange taste.  So, even if they had stayed together I wouldn't have liked them because of that.  I have two more packages, I'm not sure whether to try again, give them to a GF friend, or just throw them away (ouch).  These were definitely not worth the price and I will NOT be buying them again.<br /><br />Something similar that I am very happy with (and discovered after buying these) is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OYMB4M">Caesar's Pasta Gluten Free Manicotti with Marinara Sauce Entr&eacute;e - 4-Pack</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OYPU86">Caesar's Pasta Gluten Free Stuffed Shells with Marinara Sauce Entr&eacute;e - 4-Pack</a>, and I recommend them instead of these ravioli.  They are baked instead of boiled, so they don't fall apart, and they taste like their wheat counterparts.  I have been able to find these locally in a health food store.

review/summary: I couldn't swallow it - had to spit it out
review/text: I LOVE Conte's Florentine Pizza; it is my favorite pizza.  So eventhough I couldn't swallow their lasagna, I thought I would try another one of their products.  I purchased one bag of Conte's Gluten Free Spinach/Cheese Ravioli for $8.99 at Whole Foods and made a fresh basil pesto to serve on it.  I ended up eating the pesto and throwing out the ravioli.  The pasta has really a disgusting taste and really the thought that comes to my mind is this tastes like somebody else already spit it out.  So then I decided to try removing the pasta and just eating the inside of the pasta which that was swallable with a bunch of pesto on it.  If you are listening Conte's, my vote is for you to develop more varieties of pizza and stay away from the pasta as it is nasty.  So the cooked pastas are in the garbage disposal and the rest of the bag of frozen pastas is now in my garage garbage.  I do, however, whole-heartedly recommend my favorite GF pasta <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTZ96">Mrs. Leeper's Pasta Organic, Rice Vegetable Twists, 12 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

review/text: My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market carries a lot of gourmet items and I like to try them. This week two different varieties of Nonni's Biscotti Bites arrived on the shelves and I bought a 7-ounce bag of the Almond Dark Chocolate type. Oh, my! These are delicious! The biscuit part is fresh and ultra-crunchy and with an almond flavor. The flat bottom side has been dipped in a dark chocolate that melts in your mouth, as well as on your hands I might add. It's a very nice, very tasty combination and I have trouble limiting my consumption. They go wonderfully with coffee, and I suppose, they'd go equally well with cocoa or milk. The bag says that they're made according to an authentic Italian family recipe, but evidently they're not imported and come from Tulsa, Oklahoma. No matter. These are good!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

The first time I went and cleaned my coffee machine afterwards thinking "coffee can't taste THAT bad...can it?" and yes, this Creme Brulee coffee by Folgers really does suck that much. There is no creme brulee FLAVOR and it is the most acidic and bitter tasting coffee I've ever come in contact with. It's really just incredibly offensive and assaulting to my taste buds. Honestly..cannot get over how bad this is! As an alternative (if you can find it) Dunkin Donuts "Strawberry Shortcake" is my ultimate in flavored coffees. I found it last year in Target around Valentine's Day.. I'm hoping it shows up again this year sometime soon!

review/text: I've been using Bob's Red Mill Fava Beans but was looking for a less expensive alternative when I stumbled onto this product. It's so much better. There's no comparison. The beans are much cleaner and cook up velvety smooth. They are creamy in their consistency and, since my doctor said to cook them to mush, that's a good thing. I thought the BRMFB were large until I got these. They are huge. I don't go exactly by the directions to cook the beans. I soak for several hours and then cook. I had to keep adding water during the soaking process because they kept expanding and sticking up out of the liquid. I will definitely buy again.

review/text: My first time ordering/using this product as I am restocking for my seasonal/holiday baking. Hoping I'm not going to be disappointed how ever I'm confused about the size of the Apple Pie Spice, it's in a 16oz bottle but the label says 8oz when I compare it to the 8oz bottle of Pumpkin Pie Spice It's about 2-3 oz less. I intend to contact the seller about this matter because I have more items in my cart I want to purchase, hoping I don't have to change my mind of course. I will keep you posted on the outcome.

review/text: Since trying to eat an anti-fungal type diet, I have been trying a couple of different brands of Quinoa.  I have found this brand to be much better than NOW brand.  This brand doesn't have that slight bitter flavor.  It cooks up wonderfully in my rice cooker too.

review/text: After reading the book "Muscle foods" I set out to buy products listed in the book for a healthier life. Well, the problem here is that the foods listed are not easily found at the local stores. The item is exactly as described an provides the health value as mentioned in the book. Very happy.

review/summary: Good quality quinoa
review/text: This is good, tasty quinoa. The reason it's not rated 5 stars is that it requires washing to remove the natural "soapy" coating on the seeds. My usual brand is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDG3UE">Bob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa, 26-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a> which has similar quality but is pre-washed reducing prep time.
