review/summary: Possibly my Favorite K-Cup
review/text: I recently purchased Tully's Full City Roast, as well as Tully's House Blend.  They are both excellent, but personally, I prefer the House Blend by a small margin.  I like several of the extra bold k-cups, especially Gloria Jean's Black Gold, Timothy's Rainforest Espresso and Midnight Magic, and Coffee People Donut Shop.  But I find the Tully's House Blend to have a great mix of being rich and flavorful, but still very drinkable anytime.  It may be my favorite k-cup right now, and I will definitely keep a stock of it around our house.

review/summary: I'm a Tully's Fan! The House Blend Is Becoming One Of My Favorites.
review/text: If we had a 'I'm A Fan' button to push, I would definitely be a fan of Tully's K-cups.<br /><br />Usually I drink lots of Tully's French and/or Kona, and Italian is a new favorite that I know I'll be drinking now that I've tried it.<br /><br />When I think of Tully's Coffee House Blend, I think of going into a restaurant and smelling that wonderful aroma of freshly-made coffee. It tastes delicious!<br /><br />At first I didn't think of it as one of my all-time favorites, because it's just an excellent cup of coffee. Good flavor and aroma, not too dark, not too strong, not too bitter, just delicious. I just came back to edit this review and say that it is becoming one of my all-time favorites, just another great option from Tully's.<br /><br />I used to say that I like to keep it around to drink after I've burned out my taste buds on stronger blends and want to calm my taste buds down a little. Now I've found that I enjoy it pretty much any time.<br /><br />One thing I would say about Coffee House Blend is that it will probably please more people in a household or guests visiting than my all-time favorites, which are way too strong for many people. This is a good choice to please more people. It should please just about everyone!<br /><br />EDITED once more. I came back later to say that with all of my other K-Cup options available to me, I keep reaching for the Tully's House Blend. I don't know if it's just a mood I'm in right now or what, but the others just seem like they are trying too hard. Whatever the reason, I'm enjoying House Blend.<br /><br />EDITED still once more to say now my favorites are House and Italian, both Tully's. It's the best!

review/summary: Bold But Not Extra Bold.  Smooth, Flavorful & Not Bitter..
review/text: Tully's House Blend falls squarely into the Bold category, but it is definitely not an Extra Bold coffee.  It is smooth, flavorful and does not have a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />**** For those medium blend coffee drinkers, this blend may be too strong.  For those that like a jolt in the morning, this coffee may not be bold enough. ****<br /><br />This blend, taste-wise, is not quite as full-bodied as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M62D5S">Tully's Italian Roast, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> yet it is bolder than the Kona blends, which are no longer available.  I also find that it has a just a little more kick than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GVA4">Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>, which is one of my favorite blends to-date.

review/summary: Great coffee, excellent price
review/text: I've been drinking the Tully's House Blend K-Cup coffee for a few years now. I occasionally buy a different variety just to try it out, but always find myself wanting the Tully's more. I have to admit, I do like the new Starbucks K-cups, but they are almost as expensive as going to a Starbucks and buying coffee there, so I'll stick with my Tully's. I find the blend to be just the right mixture of smooth and bold. I can use a single K-cup twice to fill my 16 oz to-go mug and find that it's still strong enough.

review/text: I've been drinking bold flavors such as Timothy's Rain Forest Expresso and Coffee People's Wake Up Call but have grown tired of the somewhat chalky taste of both.  I recently tried Tully's Kona Blend and it's good but expensive and not available via the "Subscribe and Save" program.  So I took a chance on their House Blend and like it even better than the Kona Blend!  It's a "Bold"<br />K-cup so contains enough coffee to make the larger size cup without it's being weak and the flavor is nice and rich without being bitter or chalky-tasting.  It's my new favorite K-cup!!!

review/text: I first tasted this at my uncle's house on Christmas morning, after he got a Keurig and hooked it up for everyone's enjoyment.<br /><br />I can say without a doubt, that this is the best coffee I have ever tasted. It's absolutely *perfectly* balanced, without a hint of bitterness. Just smooth as silk, it's the kind of coffee that makes you take a sip, curl up in your chair and sigh in satisfaction at the taste. This coffee is actually prompting me to buy a Keurig of my own now, and this will be the very first blend that will go in it.

review/summary: Simply the best K cup out there
review/text: I have been thru them all and Tully's simply makes the best K cups out there. The house blend is great, breakfast blend as well and the hard to find Kona is in a class by itself. Better than Green Mountain, Timothy's, Gloria Jean and Newman's Own. They simply use better coffee beans and the cups are all very consistent. All of their coffees are "Bold" (even the breakfast blend) but the are never bitter like some other Bold varieties. The superb reviews on this brand are accurate.

review/summary: Solid Gourmet Cup of Coffee
review/text: Its just dark enough for my tastes to be brewed on the 7.25oz setting. It has a dark chocolate and brandy aroma. The house blend has a boldness falling in between a medium brew (gloria jeans hazlenut) and a lighter bold brew (newmans organic). The taste is pleasant and has notes of cocoa and malt, and an aftertaste of walnuts. I would recommend this as a keep around the house brew, but not for something to impress guests.

review/summary: Less expensive alternative to the Kona Blend
review/text: I have long been a fan of the Tully Kona Blend coffee. I was disappointed when my local retailer quit selling Kona products!<br /><br />I actually ordered this house blend by accident, thinking that I was ordering the Kona Blend. I had more than 4 cups of coffee before I noticed on the packaging that it said House Blend instead of Kona Blend. I would not have known that it was not the Kona Blend had I not seen the packaging. One caveat: I make "lattes" by adding an equal amount of steamed milk to my coffee, so the coffee flavor is probably diluted for me.  Someone drinking it straight up may notice a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />My bottom line is that it is much less expensive than the Kona Blend, due to vendor and shipping costs, and it is more than good enough for me.  I've since ordered another box.

review/text: Here in Seattle you can't turn around without bumping into a great coffee kiosk, but there is nothing like being able to enjoy a terrific cup of coffee first thing in the morning while still shlepping around in my slippers at home.  As a new Keurig owner, I taste-tested a variety of brands (since it was so easy to do) but my local favorite, Tully's, came out on top.  If smooth, rich, full-bodied coffee can be called comfort food, Tully's has it nailed.  Happily, Amazon shipments arrive promptly.  Yes, K-cup packs are pricey, but life is short.  Drink good coffee!

review/summary: Tully's Coffee House Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)
review/text: I've always appreciated my Keurig brewer but didn't realize how much until I was away from home, no brewer and NO K-cups! I hadn't anticipated the level of 'separation anxiety' I suddenly experienced. Undaunted, I purchased a package of Tully's freshly ground coffee and returned to a conventional coffee maker.  The result was ok - :} but not really the usual great.  Then came reality.  THE GROUNDs.  What a mess! Not only totally inconvenient to measure, but annoyingly difficult to confine to the basket since they always seem to prefer the counter, the sink, the floor, anywhere but where they're supposed to be.  Then, the challenge of disposal-what a mess. Next,the mixing. TOO weak(like "stump-water" I over-heard,) TOO strong...ugh!!!! It was back to that awful trial and error period  which had been so quickly forgotten.  Oh, and don't even ask about the bottled water.  Fortunately the trip was abbreviated and I was soon re-united with my Keurig brewer and my treasured Tully's K-cups.  Lesson learned.

review/text: I love Tully's House Blend K-Cups! I have several dozen other flavors and always find myself reaching for Tully's House Blend. It is just right when I wake up in the morning and throughout the day. Strong, bold, but not strong enough to make me so hyper that people run from me! I'm about to order more right now and thought I would stop and make a review while I'm thinking about it.

review/text: Tully's house blend coffee is a bold coffee that isn't bitter but delivers good coffee flavor.  I use the K-cups for that perfect cup of coffee every time.  I was looking for a replacement for the Kona blend coffee since it has become very difficult to find and the prices have sky rocketed to ridiculousness when you do find it.  This house blend has been a good replacement.

I was drinking another brand and it was leaving a nasty taste in my mouth and just didn't seem to go down as smoothly as Tully's. I really recommend you try it if you are looking for a strong but smooth coffee!

review/summary: Taste great, but jam up coffee maker
review/text: As many others have stated, the taste of this coffee is fantastic.  Flavor wise, it is by far my favorite.<br /><br />My concern is that these K-cups keep jamming up my coffee maker.  Every time I make this brand of coffee, I have to use a paper clip the next morning to un-jam the Keurig.  I've noticed that these K-cups have a unique behavior about them.  After making a cup of coffee, I go to eject the empty cup.  The empty cup has a large amount of coffee grains on the top of it.  I have never seen this before in my 4 years of using a Keurig.  I am guessing this behavior is directly affecting the coffee maker by jamming it up.

review/text: Like some of you said, I only got 48 also.  Why do they advertise 50 and then send 48?  It seems minimal to us but 2 times the number of orders adds up for them really fast.  I don't like feeling cheated probably won't order again.  The coffee was strong.  I would compare it to Starbucks.  The order information says they have three different strengths and I didn't see where you can choose the strength so they shipped me Extra Bold.  I usually drink coffee black but with this, I make a 10 oz and 4 oz with one k-cup and then add some cream so I guess that knocks down the per cup price.  Still with feeling cheated, I will look for something better.

I tried this now because I'm going camping and thought it'd provide me with an interesting treat while hiking.  It's not bad if you're looking for novelty items, or historical items, or even icecream.  As it blends with saliva, it does taste like the three flavors of icecream.  Naturally, icecream is preferable, but this is great for a trail.

review/summary: True Dragonwell flavor
review/text: My paternal ancestors were from Hangzhou, and I savor it's native Dragonwell tea with special fondness.  Numi is no watered down import, it is as authentic as the local brands.<br /><br />It's so hard to find truly organic dragonwell tea, as China's still immature market economy is wide open for abuse.  Numi's holistic sourcing practices alleviates most of my concerns.<br /><br />My wish is for them to vacuum pack their teas, as a pound of tea can grow moldy pretty fast in a warehouse or kitchen pantry.  (freezing unused tea in airtight containers does the trick).  Also, there should be a "Organic" label on the tea if it is organic as the bullet points indicate.<br /><br />For those new to Dragonwell- I recommend about half a teaspoon in a tea ball or meshed tea pot per 12 oz of water.  For those who don't enjoy heavy tannins, pre-brew and stir the leaves in a little hot water for 10-15 seconds before brewing for 5 minutes.  Experiment with pre-brew and brew times to find your ideal mix of flavors.<br /><br />Update- Amazon finally pulled the "Organic" claim from it's  description.  For a pound of tea, this is still a great deal, but I will look else where when shopping organic.

review/summary: Quality Dragonwell--Excellent Price!
review/text: This is a very good dragonwell tea. One company, Company A, used to sell their dragonwell for $32 per pound. Now, they have added $20 to that price with no explanation, bringing it to $52 lb. I have purchased more than 20 pounds of it over the years. Another company, Company S, also offers a dragonwell that is close to the same price, though, in my opinion, not as good as Company A's offering. The Numi dragonwell is a great price and made me extremely skeptical. My skepticism was unfounded. This is a superior tea. The leaf is full and the liquor is light, smooth, and slightly sweet and smoky. The only difference I recognize is that Numi does not pack this in a hermetically sealed bag. This means that you should pack it on your own when it arrives. I typically vacuum seal about eight ounces immediately. Aside from that, this is a great introduction to green tea. It is not a typically cheap green tea. Many people are turned off to green because they only tried the low-quality greens. Try this and you will see green in a different way. The price of this allows you to enjoy it often for pleasure and health!

review/summary: Good price, but not special tea
review/text: I searched extensively online to find good sources of dragon well (longjing) green tea, and bought this Numi bag as well as more expensive tea from Sevencups, Teaspring, and Amazing Green Tea. This Numi tea was the least expensive of everything I bought. You get 16 OUNCES of this for the same price as 30 GRAMS (!) of Jipin grade from Amazing green tea. That's 15 times as much tea for the same price. I only wish it were as good, but the quality is far inferior. The Jipin from Amazing green tea has far more flavor, sweetness, nuttiness, and complexity. It really is amazing. I don't have a horse in this race (I'm just a green tea lover), but wanted to post my review here in case it saved someone else from buying this when it wasn't what they wanted. If you're looking for value and don't care much about flavor, this is fine. A little burnt and bitter, but drinkable. But those seeking a peak experience of what properly picked and pan-roasted green tea can be should search elsewhere.

review/summary: Good Intro
review/text: This is a good intro into whole leaf green tea I think. It's better than bagged green teas I have tried but not as good as some other whole leaf teas I have tried.  This is good because people at first will put more leafs in than they need due to never trying whole leaf tea. This tea isn't that strong so new comers wont be turned up by over bitterness when using to many leafs. I find though that some other more expensive whole leaf teas to be a little more robust in flavor. For the price it's worth getting if your not looking to spend $50+ on some other 16oz teas.  Due to the fact that this was sitting in a warehouse for a while I would recommend taking 3/4ths of it and putting it in the freezer as it can/ will mold fast if left out. It will take you a while to use up all 16ozs.

review/summary: Not Very Good Taste
review/text: I have been living in Shanghai for over four years now, so I have a pretty good idea of what good tea tastes like. And this is not even close to good tasting tea.  I drink only the best quality Long Jing Green Tea and I drink about 1.5 liters per day. But I admit that my Chinese green tea is much more expensive than this tea. I like my tea cold and with a little sugar.<br />I brew my own tea in China at 180 degrees F, not hotter and not cooler. I put the tea in the microwave oven in a glass container with plastic wrap over the top of the pitcher.  The plastic wrap helps maintain the heat for longer after the peak temperature has been reached. I let it brew for probably an hour until it cools down to a slightly warm temperature. I pour in one-third a cup of sugar and mix it while the tea is warm. I brew the tea leaves two times with half of the 1.5 liter bottle of water each time. Then I mix the tea together and refrigerate it for at least 24 hours, preferably 48 hours.  I have found the refrigeration cycle makes the tea mellower and not bitter. Even my 56 year old Chinese fianc&eacute;e says my tea brewing method tastes better than she has ever tasted in her life. I know that refrigeration is contrary to what a lot of people think is best. But I learned this technique when I was a teenager working in a Baptist Encampment in Texas during the summer. A cook taught me that putting the huge vat of tea into a cooler for a day makes tea more mellow tasting and less bitter.  And I always got great compliments way back then from the hundreds of people who drank my tea. Of course, this was just ordinary tea, not green tea. But it works the same way with green tea.<br />The tea leaves in this Numi Dragonwell tea look the same as what I buy in China, but the taste is quite different -- definitely bitterer. I have read that the best leaves are the newly formed leaves picked from of the top of the tea tree. I have visited tea tree farms in China. Tea trees will grow into a real tree unless they are pruned to remain like a waist high tree shrub. I suspect this particular brand of tea leaves may have come from the older more mature lower branches of the tea tree.  But I have no way of knowing if that is true or not. I just know it doesn't taste nearly as good as the tea leaves I purchase in China.  And to be fair, the price I pay in China is considerably more than this price on Amazon. I just ordered another brand of tea that should arrive next week. It is a Long Jing green tea called Boston Tea. I will update my review then.

review/summary: Not What I Expected
review/text: I have many problems with this product. First, the packaging was not airtight. Who knows how long it has been sitting in the warehouse for? Second, the label said nothing about being organic, so how do I know that the description on Amazon is accurate? Third, the tea does not even taste like Longjing Tea. This leads me to believe that this is an imitation and not true Longjing. It doesn't even taste good at all. Do not buy this product!

review/text: When I first tried this tea I found it to taste delicious and drank it black. I gave this tea along with The  Rhodiola Revolution book as Christmas gifts. All the responses were positive. In fact all 5 of the people who were the recipients of this gift have since purchased additional rhodiola tea. I am not saying it ends depression or that it cures anything, I am saying I feel better after drinking this tea and it has become a daily ritual that includes my 86 year old mother and my husband.  I love this tea.

review/summary: I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES
review/text: I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES when I opened this cat food. It was not a blob of unidentifiable stuff. It wasn't little chips of something that I hoped was real. It was REAL food. So real, I had to close my eyes and blink and look again. The stuff looked so good, I felt I could eat it. Identifiable chicken shreds wrapped about pieces of brown rice with a few beans and green veggies thrown in. I was wonderstruck.<br /><br />Now, would my cats eat it? Gabriella, my large female, walked up, sniffed, backed off a few paces, then tried to play with it. Wisdom, who is in to EVEARYTHING came up and immediately dug in. Gabby watched for about a minute, then swated her and then SHE took over and ever so delicately ate. Trinity, my male had just returned from the back fourty, and waited until Gab left, then he took over. Lastly, Mercy came in and finished up the can. Everyone held up and voted with their paws and gave this five stars!<br />(Usually I wait and take a kitty vote after several cans, but Not with this one!) It was so good they all voted it 5 immediately!<br /><br />I have ordered the Tuna and Chicken so see if it is as great. I am trying to get a rotation of cat food that will all get eaten everytime. It is a tall order because the taste buds do wander. But with offerings like this Fussie Cat, I should be able to figure out what to order, put it on my Subscribe and Save and quit looking desperately for things they might eat. With this type of quality, the other brands will have to go back to the drawing board!

review/summary: My cat's love it!
review/text: I bought this cat food because my cat was having bladder problems and this came highly recommended for helping to solve them. All four of my cats love it and they have been very healthy since we switched over. The pieces are quite a bit larger than the ones in the food we had before (Merrick's) but none of our kitties seem to mind at all and they all gobble it up happily. Beware though, it is not a "low-cal" diet and one of the less active members of our family has started getting a little bit chubby over the last month or so while eating it. For the active cats the amounts listed on the bag seem great, but if you've got a lazy kitty like my Bridgette I would recommend feeding just a little bit less. All in all it's a fantastic product.

review/summary: Cats seem to like it
review/text: We have two cats, and they both seem to like this food. One of our cats is generally picky about her dry food, but even she'll eat this. The other cat will run magically appear out of nowhere every time I put this in her dish, and she seems to love the taste.<br /><br />It doesn't have as bad a smell as some of the dry food that I've fed them before, and neither cat has had any digestive issues from it. Since I feed our cats wet food too, I don't know how healthy or unhealthy they'd be if they were just eating this - but it seems to work well when fed in addition to canned food.<br /><br />Also, with some other brands our cats would always be meowing and whining like they were constantly hungry - not the case with this. It must actually contain less fillers and junk and more nutrition since it keeps them full longer.

review/summary: My cat's love this food!
review/text: I have a 3 year old big male cat, and a 10 year old female who has a sensitive stomach and is neurotic about licking herself. After trying dozens of brands that didn't make our senior throw up we used to feed them the big green bag of indoor natural from purina. My mom happened upon 6 bags of this that she got for free and gave them to us (She has no cats). At first I was skeptical because I had never seen the brand. Ahhh google is your friend, I found out that all the ingredients are VERY high quality, and not a bunch of processed garbage. My cats love it!! The eat much less of it than the cheaper brands (and not-so-cheaper like iams and science diet) that have a lot of junk and fillers in them. Both cats also have the softest coats I've ever felt on a cat now too. I know it is expensive, but it really is worth the price. It takes my cats about a month to go through this size bag, compared to the big huge one we used to buy of the Purina, which actually balances out the higher price. Buy it, show your cats you REALLY love them! :)

review/summary: Hmm, Good Health....not so much.
review/text: I wanted to like these, as sweet potato chips are a fine alternative to the usual run-of-the-mill offerings you find parked in a bowl at gatherings. Problem is, the quality is so poor that I couldn't even enjoy their flavor.<br /><br />First issue is the shape consistency. I see I'm not the only reviewer here of that opinion, and of course he was flamed in the comments section for being an ignorant Philistine who couldn't grasp the concept of "natural". I beg to differ. You don't need to be a card carrying member of the P.E.T.A.-Vegan-Holistic Medicine-Sleeping Under Pyramids brigade to know lousy QC when you see it. And by "it", I mean there may be 3 actual chips in the bag that resemble a cross-section of a sweet tuber. The rest look something like the evil spawn of a Frito and a Cheese Doodle. Pretty impossible to attempt any sort of dipping with these if you don't want all your guests sharing each other's DNA from their fingers. Makes one wonder if they're using a washing machine to do their "kettle" cooking as these specimens look like they went to war during the  processing phase.<br /><br />The other, and more egregious issue is the reason for the review title. There's 5oz. in the bag, but about 2 actual servings. Why, you ask? Oil. The actual amount of the product itself equals about half of a 7oz. bag of Trader Joe's Crinkle Cut Sweet Potato Chips (which btw, look like the real deal we've all grown to love and got fat from). These things are so saturated you'll find shiny ones glistening with so much oil that they remind me of my own attempts at making these at home. You'd think there would be some sort of drying-leaching of oil phase in the assembly line before they landed in the bag. And forget doing the crumb-dump when you get to the end; all the little pieces are stuck to the inside of the slimy bag. Kinda like when your at the movies and you get to the bottom of the popcorn bag you regret asking for extra butter-like-substance.<br /><br />I've been through 4 bags of a case, and they're all identical in quality, so unless they had a bad day at the factory when they made up my order, I can only come to the conclusion that others who seem to like these either have lower standards, or they've never had other brands to compare to.<br /><br />Sorry for the long rant, but that was my experience with this product and I felt it was my duty to be helpful to others who might be interested in these. I'll be cancelling my auto-order for these, and go back to TJ's for their superior chips; more of 'em, and cheaper too!

review/text: Caffeine wires me so for many years I avoided coffee. I wanted the stimulation a cup of coffee provides, but wanted a convenient way to brew it. I found the Folgers single servings and they were perfect. But I had to start either limiting my coffee intake or  brew decaf instead.<br /><br /> The Folgers decaf single servings are perfect. Just heat the water and let it brew. I let it seep for a couple of minutes, which is much longer than Folgers suggests, but I like my coffee strong.<br /><br /> These things are the ultimate in convenience. A single serving in a neat little packet - and it's a great cup of coffee. When I travel, I pack enough to get me through the trip: much better than that awful stuff you can make in-room.<br /><br />Jerry
