review/summary: The replacement for Maxwell House Slow Roast Coffee!!!
review/text: I had bought Maxwell House Slow Roast Coffee for years.  When I could no longer buy it locally, I started buying it online. Well, when the price on the few places you could find it were about >$20 for 33 oz, I gave up and started searching for a replacement.<br /><br />A delightful person at a store that had previously carried it took it upon herself to do some research on my behalf, and found that Eight O'Clock regular ground was well-reviewed, and suggested it to me.<br /><br />YES! Perfect replacement for MH Slow Roast, readily available and doesn't cost a fortune, especially when you buy it online. With subscription, it's cheaper to have shipped to the house than it is in local grocery stores. YEA!!!!!<br /><br />GREAT smooooth coffee, can make it strong and it still doesn't tear your stomach up if you prefer a "thick" cup of coffee. :)

review/summary: Really great coffee at a really great price!
review/text: I started buying this coffee when I was looking for one that was less expensive.  I tried a variety of lower priced coffees, different roasts, flavors, etc.  I prefer a milder, less acidic taste, and surprisingly I thought it was the best.  My favorite up to that point was Dunkin Donuts whole bean medium roast, but the price was going higher everytime I purchased it. I was on a quest to brew a great cup that tastes similar to what we find in a diner, at a lower price and this fit the bill perfectly.  Eight O'Clock is a mild but full bodied flavor, with less acidity and no bitterness.  Very drinkable with or without cream.  Since higher acid in coffee sometimes upsets my stomach, I thought I might have to stop drinking it altogether.  For the best cup, I always grind my own beans, and recently switched from a drip maker to a percolator.  Since this is an old fashioned favorite, I think the percolator is appropriate. I still grind the beans, and prepare the percolator the night before (just like I did with my automatic timer Mr. Coffee) and plugged the percolator into a light timer set for my early morning time.  That way, my coffee is still ready for me when I'm still half asleep.  My husband, who always used half-and -half in his coffee, now drinks Eight O'Clock black.  We both highly recommend Eight O'Clock coffee for a flavorful cup every day that tastes like our favorite diner!

review/summary: Average, nothing outstanding
review/text: I had not tasted Eight O'clock coffee in a number of years so I decided to give it a try again. The first thing I noticed when I opened the bag was the slightly 'burnt' smell...which to me indicates the beans are roasted too hot or too fast.  I have made 3 pots of coffee from this bag ( I keep it in the fridge ). The taste is very average, sort of like coffee you get at Denny's or Shari's.  It's okay, but nothing special. I may try the Eight O'clock Columbian to see if I like it better.

review/summary: hmmm.  bizarre
review/text: I saw Eight O'Clock coffee, whole-bean unground, 11 ounce bag for $4 at the local grocery store chain, aka HEB(it's a big one, here in Texas).  I was blown away!  I recognized the name as something of a throwback from decades past, probably my grandmother would remember this coffee brand, and at this price, it was worth a gamble.  I bought four of them.<br /><br />My motto is, how bad can you screw up the coffee, if you can grind the whole beans yourself, and the beans haven't been sitting there for a couple of years?  Even the cheapest coffee, if roasted minimally and ground fresh by me, tastes better then the most expensive coffee, that is pre-ground, sitting on a shelf for a few months.  There is no comparison, fresh ground always crushes, pun not intended, pre-ground.<br /><br />So back to this Eight O'Clock whole-bean coffee I got on sale.  I use my electric grinder, which is the typical handheld electric grinder, and I top it off with the Eight O'Clock beans, which is the normal amount, grind it, and throw it in my french coffee press, add the nearly boiling water, press it, and pour myself a cup.  Oh yea, I add heavy whipping cream, instead of half and half, because I'm watching my carbs.<br /><br />What can I say? Coffee is great.  It's different from the Starbucks burnt flavor, cause I have Starbucks wholebean as well.  Eight O'Clock has a hint of sweetness, I'm pretty sure that several local restaurants must use Tata for coffee, because it has a similar flavor.  It's obvious that it's not as heavily roasted as Starbucks, but what is?<br /><br />Anyway, after reading the negative reviews here, I'm not sure if there's a quality control issue, a bad batch, or if there is some counterfeit coffee being sold ....whatever the problem is, I know I won't be buying this Eight O'Clock coffee online.  I trust my local grocer if  run into a bad batch to take it back.<br /><br />I'm going back tonight to buy out the rest of their Eight O'Clock.

review/summary: The best coffee I've ever tasted!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E50THY">Eight O'Clock Coffee, Original Ground, 12-Ounce Bag (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />My family has been using Eight O'Clock coffee for at least 70 years.<br />I grew up with it.  When I was 9 years old my mother allowed me to start drinking it.<br />She would make a cup of 3/4 hot milk and 1/4 Eight O'Clock.  When I was in my teens<br />she made a 50-50 mix of milk and coffee.  At 18 I started drinking it full-strength<br />with just a couple teaspoons of milk and a bit of sugar.<br />I've never been a black coffee drinker because of the way my mother started me out<br />with milk - however, there have been times in my life when we forgot to buy milk and<br />I drank it black.<br />Eight O'Clock is the ONLY coffee I can drink black.<br /><br />I have just purchased my 4th Farberware Stainless Steel Stove-top Coffee Pot from Amazon.<br />I've used these for the past 40 years and will still continue purchasing Eight O'Clock coffee<br />to use in them.<br /><br />I never knew you could get Eight O'Clock through Amazon!  I just took a chance and typed it in.<br />It's so much easier.  You get it at your door in 2 days!  No running long distances to buy it or having family members elsewhere purchase it for me and mail it to me.<br /><br />The Original Ground Eight O'Clock has a gentle, non-bitter flavor that starts your day<br />with contentment rather than a jolt!<br /><br />Over the past 40 years I've had to switch to other coffees when the original supplier (A&P Supermarkets) went out of business in my area and I couldn't find it elsewhere.<br />But other coffees STILL can't stand up to Eight O'Clock for my taste.

It wasn't identical, but comparable -- not too strong/weak and not bitter. Enjoyed the coffee and the price on Amazon can't be beat, way cheaper than buying from the local grocery store.

For the same amount of coffee, this 8'clock one generates much less aroma and coffee-taste. I had to put in so much more to feel some taste of coffee. In this regard, this is not worth the money. I am even wondering if they blend non-coffee things in it. I really do not understand where the good reviews comes from.

When you wake up in the morning and the coffee does not smell good to you, you know it is not right.<br />I tried to convince myself that it may be adequately drinkable so that I can at least finish the 4 pack from subscribe and save.  Unfortunately, it did not make it pass the second sip.

review/text: I love ritz but the regular ones are so darn salty, I feel like I am eating a salt slab everytime I put one in my mouth.  So my mom suggested that I try their low soduim crackers, I had no idea they made low sodium crackers but am so happy that they do.  You still get that wondeful butter like flavor of a regular ritz but no where as salty as the regular ones.  They pack a nice flavor and crispy crunch that I love so much.  You can still taste a little bit of salt, but its such a wonderful balance that works wonders. This is my go to snack cracker whether its just to snack on or to make PB crackers with.

review/summary: Great alternative that holds up when frothed
review/text: I had to give up dairy last month, and I was most bummed about my daily latte habit. I've never liked soy lattes... until now. This is an excellent alternative that I found out about when I ordered a soy latte at my favorite coffee shop. Now, we keep it stocked at home for me and for our non-dairy friends. I love that it is shelf-stable as well as tasty.

review/summary: specially made for hot beverages - doesn't curdle!
review/text: this soy milk tastes exactly like most soy milks in thickness and consistency, although it seems to have less of the "beany" taste that some others have. the only difference is that it does not curdle in hot beverages like normal soy milk (thats why it marketed as specifically for baristas). It does an amazing job of that and tastes great. One of my favorite brands!

review/summary: Barista Series - Froths Beautifully & Great Taste
review/text: I have long loved making lattes at home.  However, I have always had one problem.<br /><br />I prefer to drink lattes with soy milk.  Not only do I prefer not to have so much dairy, but I find they taste better, when it is a quality, appropriate soy milk.  I had tried many soy milks at the grocery store.  However, I always found that they did not froth/steam well.  They turned out tasting awful, and these soy milks from other companies had what Pacific Natural Foods call a "beany," taste.  They specifically say their product does not have this "beany taste."  For the most part, I agree.<br /><br />It's a good tasting product.  I was a bit scared about the vanilla, but I really do not detect vanilla in the latte.  I get a bit of aftertaste, but when it's a good latte, the espresso tends to override any slight deficiency in this product.<br /><br />It holds up very nicely to steaming and produces a great forth.<br /><br />Without question, this is the best soy milk I have ever steamed myself.  I am glad I found it.  The packaging is great too.  I received product with an expiration date ten months into the future.  It is easy to store in your pantry, with the square boxes.  Fantastic.  I'm going to stock up.<br /><br />Highly recommended for at home baristas!

review/summary: soy microfoam!
review/text: I first blamed my cheapo espresso maker for my inability to get nice soft creamy foam out my soy milk. I then upgraded to the rocket cellini, a much nicer and more powerful machine. And Wham! still no microfoam. My wife and I are both vegans so we stuck with non dairy 'milks'. Tried different soy milks, from Silk to Kirkland's. Nothing. We also tried Almond milk, which I read would froth. Well, Froth they did. But it wasn't a soft velvety, wet-paint, microfoam. Well, the soy blenders solves that! It does froth beautifully and it tastes great. Definitely worth trying. That's one less variable to worry about in making that perfect breakfast latte.

review/text: I was delighted to be able to purchase a case of this on Amazon as this is the specific brand + range used by many local coffee shops that is otherwise unavailable to the general public.<br /><br />As stated by others, the key difference is that it doesn't curdle under higher temperatures and that makes it ideal for frothing.

review/summary: I miss my Dutch Brothers
review/text: Moved to Eugene from Medford back in 2003. Was able to keep my Dutch Bro addiction going. But then the drink<br />was not tasting as good. At first I figured the help in Eugene was not as good as the people in Medford. I tried<br />it plain and with chocolate. Then one day, one of the kids mentioned they were using a new soy milk. Well I<br />started going back to Starbucks to do some comparison. The Starbucks drink was nicer and they were getting<br />better with their drinks. I found out that Dutch Brothers was using this new 'blenders'from Pacific. I figured that<br />is where the goofy taste was from. Mentioned it to Dutch Brothers and they pretty much said 'tough'. I<br />thought maybe I was being somewhat harsh. Then when I was in the Seattle area I went by a place called<br /> "Bigfoot Java". Even though they used 'blenders' I went ahead and ordered a drink. Still the same poor taste<br />and another late night expresso place I can't go to. I use Pacific rice milk at home. I know that Pacific's<br />regular soymilk is good.  I have no idea what they do to 'blenders'. But they should change it. The taste<br />is way wrong compared to the soymilks other places use. I want my Dutch Bros. Sometimes I have gone with<br />a breve, but my gut does not like dairy anymore. Pacific go out and check the competition. It is time to<br />change the formula. Blenders suck.

review/summary: Not discontinued!
review/text: Despite the many comments online that Tuna Tetrazzini is gone the truth is it's not discontinued, it's simply harder to find. Go to your bigger chain grocers (my Ralph's always has it in stock and frequently has 10/$10 sales) or Super Wal-Mart. Basically any store that normally has a wide selection of Helper flavors. Your smaller grocery chains, Target, Walgreens, etc will not have it. They only<br />want to carry the Creamy Pasta and Creamy Broccoli varieties for some reason. Why this is the case makes no sense. When I was growing up tetrazzini was the favorite flavor in our house and you could always find it at the store. Betty Crocker has been making some baffling changes to the Helper line like refusing to put microwave directions on the box (check online if you need them), making flavors harder to find, and reducing the amount of noodles in certain varieties. If you really can't find Tetrazzini, go with Tuna Melt, the other good TH flavor. The others are just not good.

That's only 3 months!  And I bought a case, so that was 6 boxes!  I did not notice this until this month, so now I feel like I need to use them all up very soon!  When you buy this product in a grocery store, you usually have at least an entire year before the "best if used by" date!  I will not buy a case of anything through Amazon again, unless it is something I don't have to worry about the expiration date.

review/text: All the Tuna Helpers are excellent, but the Tetrazzini is the best in my view. Oddly, the one package I used of my shipment from Amazon did not have the extraordinary flavor of the one I purchased in our local store. Since my original purchase, my local store does not carry the Tetrazzini Tuna Helper. I am willing to accept that the one package I purchased from Amazon was not a true sample of the excellent Tetrazzini put out under the Tuna Helper label. Since the product is, I assume, made the same way each time, I expect the balance of the boxes I purchased to exhibit the same flavor as the first box I purchased from my local store.

If all your toiletries (shampoos, body washes, lotions, etc.) are together with your makeup, you can't carry them on (liquids & gels over 2 oz).  It rolls up, but holds alot and has a nice, sturdy metal hanger hook so you can hang them on the back of the hotel bathroom doors.  These Hadaki cases are made with fabulous quality and I love them!

review/summary: The Best GF Black Licorice Experience
review/text: I've posted a previous review on Amazon for this product, however it doesn't seem to get pulled up most of the time.<br /><br />Chateau D'Lanz Swiss licorice is a wonderful taste experience.  IMO, Swiss Licorice has the richest, deepest, truest black licorice flavor of the 4 commercial GF black Licorice products I've tried (others: OrgraN, Belgian, Allen's).  It's even better than my homemade attempts at GF black licorice.<br /><br />Swiss Licorice is a total taste bliss-out.  It melts slowly, with each piece giving a lengthy gustatory experience.  IME, the slow-melting, big taste aspect of Swiss Licorice make it economical.  I don't find, as with other brands, that I need to gobble more and more of it.<br /><br />Swiss Licorice is a not a high-sugar product, IMO.  It also has some fiber, courtesy of acacia gum.  Possibly the combination of these 2 factors contributes to the "satisfying" (no need to binge) aspect.<br /><br />This product is less chewy than some of the other brands.  I thought I'd miss that, however the flavor & long-lastingness of Swiss Licorice trump chew, IMO.<br /><br />If you love black licorice, you owe it to yourself to try this product.  It's great for both regular black licorice fanatics, as well as celiac / gluten-intolerant black licorice devotees.<br /><br />Now if the Chateau could only come up with  the GF equivalent of cherry Nibs ...

review/text: This licorice is the exact product I have been looking for for years.  There used to be a small candy shop just outside of Chicago that used to make a similar product.  However, due to the destruction of a tree where one of the ingredients was harvested, the shop stopped making the licorice, permanently.  This product is the closest product I have found to the one made at that candy shop.  It is a combination of hard candy until it is moistened; then it becomes the consistency of a very tough jelly bean.  If you do not chew the licorice and allow it to dissolve, it wii last a long time.

review/text: The richest tasting licorice I've ever tasted.  And I'm a licorice lover.  These are very much like those my mom used to buy at Sears back in the 50's.  And slow to dessolve on the tongue so they last and last.  Highly recommended for the best licorice experience.<br />I'm not sure why someone said these were stale and stuck together.  They sell so fast you sometimes have to wait while more are made and shipped to Amazon.  Probably someone who dislikes everything.  On a scale from 1 to 10 these are a 20.  In fact these are so superior to other licorice that there is no comparison to be made.  I've tried just about all types, too.  So many of the Euro garbage licorice has ammonium chloride which smells and tastes weird and is bad for you.  This stuff is the old-fashioned pure hard licorice buttons that are no longer available anywhere else.  If anyone knows where I can get this product elsewhere for less money let me know.

review/summary: Best black licorice ever!
review/text: This is REAL licorice, with a strong, robust flavor and great texture that best matches a treat I used to enjoy as a kid.<br />This isn't a licorice for Twizzler lovers....but that isn't really licorice in my world.<br />I love the texture, hard at first, (this also isn't for those who only like soft licorice). but as it warms and dissolves in your mouth it softens a bit and takes on a pleasantly smooth, slippery feel on the tongue. Meant to be dissolved slowly and savored, NOT chewed.<br />Over all, perhaps the best black licorice I have ever tasted.<br />I am addicted and will be putting in for a monthly supply!! Really, really good stuff!!<br />Enjoy!!

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: I don't know which gluten-free licorice I like better, this or a different chewier style brand.  This is a rich-tasting, slightly soft licorice drop that lasts a long time in my mouth.  It's got a great licorice flavor and just the right amount of sweetness.  I've never had anything quite like it before.  Chateau D'Lanz is the kind of quality product where you forget you bought it because it was gluten-free.  It's simply very good licorice and I will definitely buy more.

review/summary: Over Rated/Over Priced
review/text: After reading the reviews I decided to try this expensive licorice.  I have purchased many different types of black licorice from Amazon and feel this licorice is definitely overrated and overpriced.  It tastes good but it's definitely not worth $17.00 a pound.  The licorice is hard and does stick to your teeth if you chew it.  There are many other black licorice products, at a third of the price, that taste as good or better.  This is Swiss Licorcie made in the USA--not sure why it commands such a high price.  I recommend you try the German Haribo licorice wheels or the Finska licorice ripples, they are not hard licorice but they have a great flavor!

review/text: I received the packages of Licorice and they were all melted into solid bundles....  individual pieces were very difficult to extract.... and when i did was very disappointed with the taste.  They are not sweet enough... kind of bitter tasting --- these do  not compare to the Cadbury's I remember when I was much younger.... wonder if Cadbury still makes licorice candy? and I think these are way overpriced.  I don't think i'll finish eating them.  I should have returned them to Amazon.  I will not order these again

review/summary: Very inconsistent
review/text: I raved about Kopi after my first tasting last year. It was smooth and rich with a wonderful caramel finish I had never experienced before. Since then I have had five other batches from two different vendors. Each of these later coffees were very disappointing. One vendor even sent a replacement bag (worth $80) after I gave a negative review to "renew your faith in Kopi". But I have never had a Kopi Luwak as good as that first one. When I am going to spend this amount of money on coffee, or anything else for that matter, I'm going to need to know I am getting consistent quality of product and that is definitely not the case here. I just received a 100 gram bag as a gift from a friend and it was the most disappointing of all. I get better Sumatran coffee from my local roaster for $12 lb. I'm glad to say I've had the experience of trying the most expensive coffee in the world, but I won't be buying any more.

review/summary: Excellent coffee. You can really taste the processing.
review/text: This is high quality coffee and it's well worth it. When brewed, you can really taste the rich flavoring which is added through the unique civet processing method. It tastes like a mixture of coffee, chocolate, peanut butter, and poo. And this is no ordinary poo. It's much better tasting than any other I've found laying around.<br /><br />Though, I have come to prefer eating the beans fresh, that way you really get the flavor of the civet's digestive enzymes and it's a bit nutty that way.

A friend of mine who drinks tea religiously recommended this tea so I tried it with little to no expectations.<br /><br />Fast forward a couple months and now I drink the tea 3-4 times a week. It's calming and I feel great afterwards.<br /><br />This tea has become a great alternative for my energy drinks and I know it's better for my body.<br /><br />I still drink my energy drinks (probably always will) but not I like to add this tea to my mix to promote a healthier lifestyle.<br /><br />I would recommend this Oolong tea for anyone who wants to stop drinking sugar filled drinks. This tea is all natural with no preservatives. Their website lists how there are many health benefits associated with this tea too.

review/summary: The best green chai
review/text: I've tried every green chai available and this is hands down my favorite.  The dominant spice is ginger and the aromas during steeping are incredible.<br /><br />Unlike many green teas, you can brew this for an extended time (i.e. when you forget about it) and it still doesn't get bitter.  I take mine with a little sweetener and some cream.<br /><br />Excellent tea and it can't hurt that it is organic.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Therapy in a cup!
review/text: I can't get enough of this tea! The experience starts when you tear open the envelope and inhale the gorgeous aromas of cinnamon, cloves and ginger. Continue enjoying the calming scent as your tea steeps in the hot water and meditat on the little pearl of wisdom written on each tag. Finally, in 3 to 5 minutes when you drink your tea, you'll start to realize while no other green chai tea will ever measure up again. This is the best - truly, therapy in a cup. But please note: if you're not used to chai tea, it may take a few cups to get used to - I think it's a little stronger than other chai. The traditional way to drink this is with sweetener and a little milk, although I prefer mine with just hot water. Often I will throw a thimble-sized amount of peeled and chopped fresh ginger root into my mug and leave it in there as an extra health and flavor boost while I drink my tea. Heavenly!

review/text: i never knew how healing this tea is till i stopped using it. I have used this tea for several years now, however i was traveling internationally for about 6 months and did not have this tea on hand. I kept getting congested all the time i was there. I asked my sister to mail me a box of this tea. I never felt more relieved afterward....by the way this was nasal, sinus and chest congestion. I do also eat a lot of dairy products. The warming ginger and pepper act as perfect antidotes for releiving excess mucus. Plus this tea has actual ginger root(not extract), and all the herbs they use are in their whole form and not in extract like many teas.<br />Thanx yogi, for creating this masterpiece of a healing tea.<br /><br />UPDATE- I dont really know whats up with this  as of late- i have ordered this from Amazon as well as other sources and it taste so stale and grassy. I dont know if they changed the formula, but it has started to taste downright nasty!!!! Cmon yogi-change it back to the way it was.

review/text: Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />Apples and Apricots<br />A huge huge hit with both my son and my daughter. My daughter is now eating the baby food in the house and tends to prefer veggies over fruits so far, but this is one she will eat on a pretty regular basis. My son also loved this variety as well. I like that it's a little different than just plain apples and the jar size is big enough to sustain her through an entire meal with a little cereal on the side.

review/summary: Decent product, good price
review/text: I use a LOT of canned tomatoes.  I prefer to start with whole canned tomatoes because you get the best parts of the tomato instead of the bits and smashed ones that go into crushed tomatoes or other varieties.  I cook a lot, and turn these tomatoes into sauces, soups, stews, even quick salsas.  They are one of the most versatile staples in my kitchen so I like to always have them on hand.<br /><br />I can take or leave the bits of basil in this particular variety- you can definitely see the big pieces but I don't taste basil really in the tomatoes or sauce surrounding them.  This is fine with me because it makes them more versatile but if you're really looking for a basil flavor in the tomatoes, these aren't really it.<br /><br />I also like having them delivered because large cans are HEAVY and if you live in a city like I do, you are generally carrying home whatever you buy.  Instead, they show up on my doorstep and I have them when I need them.

review/summary: Scam Marzano tomatoes!
review/text: If you are just ordering canned tomatoes, then so be it.  These, however, are depicted as "Product of San Marzano" tomatoes.  What arrived were just canned Italian tomatoes with no indication that they are from San Marzano, because they aren't.  The labels are identical, except where the one in the illustration says "Product of San Marzano", these just say "Product of Italy".<br /><br />For those who buy California "champagne", Dominican "Cohibas" and salmon "caviar", please enjoy these tomatoes, as you probably won't notice the difference.  They are not, however, San Marzanos, so if you think you've uncovered a great deal, you haven't.  All you've found is a pure and unadulterated example of "bait and switch".<br /><br />Also beware the blanket Amazon disclaimer: "Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product."  Nice!  Not sure how exactly one can rely on information other than what they provide or read the labels BEFORE one places one's order.<br /><br />Anyway, you've been warned.  Caveat emptor.

review/summary: Cento Tomatoes
review/text: I was very disappointed with the Cento canned tomatoes I purchased recently.  I bought 2 packages of 12 cans each and every can was dented.  I realized that the reason they must be able to sell Cento much cheaper than in the stores, is that these cans are the ones they cannot sell due to damage. I had to throw 2 of the cans away as the were leaking.  I guess there is truth in "you get what you pay for".  I will not purchase this again through Amazon.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C4C67C">Cento Imported Italian Tomatoes, 35-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: spicy and flavorful
review/text: I have been using walkerswood jerk seasoning for a while now.  I tried making my own but this is better.  It can get pretty hot though when used generously.  The 9.25 is a way better deal than the small bottles.  If you like hot jerk this is great I've used it on ribs cornish hens chicken and pork all good.

review/summary: Best Jerk Seasoning out there!
review/text: Title says it all.  Many of my Jamaican friends swear by this particular brand compared to the other major competitor of the Jerk Seasoning.  Want to liven up your next BBQ.  Get some of this (smaller bottle) and marinade some meat (chicken or pork most popular) over night and then throw on the grill.  Guaranteed to be a hit!

review/summary: Best ever!!!
review/text: The taste of this sauce is incredible. I have tasted many other brands, some better than others - but this one has the best taste and just enough bite (spiciness) to make it incredible!

review/summary: Good Deal
review/text: This is such a good deal to purchase in the large container.  But we wondered where we would store it if after we opened it.  Then we got an idea: After we purchased this product we 'can it' in 8oz jars and use it for gifts or our own personal use.  This is a much better way to make this product last than to store it in the refrigerator!!

review/summary: You have to try this stuff
review/text: This is the best Jerk seasoning on the market. I have tried many types that are out there including the dry rubs, sauces, and marinades - nothing compares to this authentic style of Jerk that come directly from Jamaica - you have to try it.

review/summary: A big block of salt! :)
review/text: Received the product in plastic wrapping. It is important to keep it under wraps as the salt has the natural tendency to attract moisture esp in places of high humility.<br /><br />Apart from a minor dent on of the edges, it is a nice big piece of salt brick for cooking. There is also an instructions to reminder users to slowly heat up the block to avoid causing it to crack.<br /><br />I am happy with this product.

review/text: Hands down the best SoyMilk beverage out there. Over the years I've tried countless numbers of Soy Drinks and time after time was left with that "Mr. YuK" expression on my face..... that was until my friend suggested I give Yeo's a shot. One sip & my days of searching for a delicious soymilk beverage were over! I LOOOOOVE my Yeo's. I find it a bit pricey but hey I'm willig to pay the price, for this creamy, perfectly sweetened treat. Ya just gotta give it a try!
