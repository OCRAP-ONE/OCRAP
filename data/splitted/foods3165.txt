review/summary: Well worth getting
review/text: This chickpea flour is absolutely delicious. It makes far more tasty bread than regular white flour since it has a richer, stronger flavor. The packaging is air-tight, and the flour inside was pristine (no bugs or unidentified matter). I would purchase this again from this seller.

review/summary: A Wonderful Gluten Free Flour
review/text: It's difficult to find an affordable, organic, gluten-free chickpea flour at any local grocery store, including Whole Foods. I've tried other brands and find this one makes delicious cinnamon-raisin breakfast muffins, socca, and pakoras (that I bake rather than fry), which even my finicky son loves. If you haven't used chickpea flour, just remember you don't want to taste it before cooking because all chickpea flour has an unappealing taste that disappears during cooking. I noticed one reviewer states that this flour is not smooth and doesn't stay together. I've never encountered that problem, but I don't deep fry anything. Definitely a 5 Star organic, gluten-free flour.

review/summary: Works for me!
review/text: When I read the review that only gave the Bumble Bee Sensations "Sundried Tomato and Basil Tuna Medley" only ONE star, I just had to voice my opinion! There is nothing weird about this product; it tastes great, the consistency is fine, and the crackers are good, too.  I find the whole Sensations line to be extremely convenient. I have purchased the classic Tuna Salad, the Spicy Thai Chili Medley, and the Sundried Tomato & Basil Medley numerous times, and have never had any complaints. The only one I haven't tried yet is the Lemon seasoned Tuna. I plan on buying that one, too, when I make my next purchase.<br />People's tastes are different, but the only complaint I would accept would be that the Thai Chili Tuna is too spicy for their tastes - and I stress "for their tastes". I've had Indian and Asian food dishes that were much spicier than the Bumble Bee Spicy Thai Chili Tuna!<br />All in all, I can't see you going wrong if you purchase this product - or any of the Bumble Bee Sensations line.  I enjoy them, and will continue to buy them!

review/text: I LOVE the Thai Chili tuna kit, so I thought I would try the other flavors.  This one is my least favorite because it's bland compared to the others.  That said, I ate the whole can and was fairly happy with my light dinner; it was just not as good at the other two flavors and I'm glad I tried it in the single serve pack before committing to a whole case.

review/summary: Cute box, but they are just regular Angry Bird gummies repackaged
review/text: My 3 year old son loves Angry Birds (and specifically the new Angry Birds Space game) so I purchased these gummies for him. The box design is great, but we were disappointed to open them up and find that they are nothing more than the "regular" birds repackaged into a space box. My son was looking forward to eating the new purple lazer bird and green "big brother" bird, but they are nowhere to be found. Shame on Rovio for not making any effort and repackaging the same-old gummies! Additionally, they were $10 which I found to be a bit pricy for fruit snacks. I know they are a luxury product and demand is not as high as the big name brands in the grocery store, but when the Spider-Man gummies are $2 for a box at the grocery store, and these are $10, I probably won't be buying these again for a while!

review/summary: Great Iced Tea
review/text: I've never tried this brand before but caught a good deal and ended up rolling the dice on (1 case)8 bottles of it, I actually really enjoyed this tea more than I thought I would. The ingredients are very few and all organic. It's black tea so there is a strong flavor to it, with a slight bitterness but for those who like strong iced tea it's delicious. Very very different from the weak commercial "tea" products.<br /><br />I've gone through 5 bottles in two & half weeks so far, waiting for another deal to order more!

Drink your tea in moderation if you're worried about calories.

So I thought that I had somehow deleted it, and I thought I was correcting by adding it back to my subscription. But in error, I ordered the tea with sugar, 70 calories per serving. For a tea with sugar in it is OK, and if you like your tea sweet you may well like this tea. However, they do offer a DIET version and if you prefer to avoid the extra calories, the diet tea is a GOOD tea, I think it is BETTER.

Then go down the right hand side to where it says "Get Express customer service or contact us by e-mail or phone". Click on "Contact Us" and then proceed to follow the directions. You have the option to be contacted by phone. It's the ONLY way I ever deal with them. Hope that helps everyone for future problems. :)

review/text: I'm absolutely addicted to this product.  I first purchased a package of them at Whole Foods Market, where they're sold for $4.99/package.  Since we don't make trips to Whole Foods on a very regular basis, I knew I'd either have to buy them in bulk from there (which would be outrageously expensive) or try to find them elsewhere, so I looked on Amazon.  It was an excellent deal with both Subscribe & Save and our Amazon Prime Student membership.  When I received the box of six packages, however, I noticed that the first had slightly broken/crumbled fig bars in it... and then the second and third and fourth.  So basically, it just looks like someone or some people handled the box very poorly.  I will purchase this again though, and hopefully all of my fig bars will be perfectly intact next time!

review/text: Funny how this product seems so polarizing.  I dislike Fig Newtons but love these bars' true-fruit sweetness and gooey density.  Some bars do stick together. The filling is by no means hard to chew or gigantic, though, as some reviewers have oddly implied.  If freshness was ever a problem, it may have been corrected: the shipment I got was several months before the expiration date.<br /><br />My only qualm: though naturally sweetened, each piece contains 8g sugar. The serving size of 2 bars is more filling than you'd expect, but if eaten as a quick breakfast or even lasting snack you'd need at least 4 -- for 32g sugar.  "Natural" or not that's too much sugar.

review/summary: My Kids (and I) love these!
review/text: These are our GO TO store bought cookie. The kids love them. I love that they aren't filled with sugar and crap. Just whole grains and ingredients you can recognize on the label. They don't crumble when dunked (and believe me, we are dunkers). They make a great 'on the go' breakfast cookie when you are rushed in the morning. What mom doesn't love that?!?<br /><br />We have ordered several shipments of these from amazon. Always fresh and always fast. Best price. They run TWICE the price at the local 'natural' grocery chain.

review/summary: Delicious Raspberry fig bars!
review/text: First, I second the comments of some who have noted shipping issues.  My shipment came with the cookies very tightly packed in a single box that was of less than sturdy construction leading to some crushed packages. Luckily, few bars/cookies were affected, but that was a big surprise as the box corners had caved in.  But putting that aside...<br /><br />These cookies were very tasty.  The Raspberry fig filling is delicious.  Lots of good raspberry flavor.  The thick "cookie" wrapper has a distinct grain (barley) flavor.  A new flavor to me, but I got used to it.  Overall, though, simply delicious.  I love figs, fig bars, and raspberries so a taste treat for me.<br /><br />I purchased via "Subscribe & Save" for the best price.  My biggest problem now is not eating too many of these as they are fairly high in calories (120 cals/2 bars).  But they are good, healthy calories! ;)

review/text: My husband and I have tried a variety of really tasty vegan treats, but these are the best in both taste and value.  We've had the fig, blueberry and raspberry - the blueberry is my favorite - and find them to be delicious and satisfying. They're a great deal on Subscribe and Save, too!

review/text: I bought these by chance at my local health food store and was completely surprised by how good they were, better than Newman's, by far and a little less expensive. The whole wheat is hearty and the fig filling has just the right consistency and sweetness. I'd feed these to my children in a heartbeat.

review/summary: Tasty little treats but not organic
review/text: If these little cookies were organic they would get 5 stars plus, but alas they are not.  They are extra sweet with only 60 calories per bar, mostly from concentrated fruit juices.  They do have a definite raspberry taste and I'm a sucker for "anything raspberry"!<br /><br />We are not gluten sensitive but do not eat wheat. I bought them because they contain no wheat or refined sugar and the price on Amazon is very good.  I just wish Barbara's bakery would change to organic ingredients because they make such tasty treats.<br /><br />All that said, two bars and a nice big glass of soy or almond milk make for a satisfied evening tummy! (They're good with coffee or tea too.)

review/summary: Good, but you have to like whole grain. Freeze well.
review/text: These fig bars are big step up over the typical supermarket brands, but you do have to like a strong whole-grain taste and the lack of additives makes them a bit dry. They freeze well so it works ok to buy the six pack. They actually make a nice cold sweet if you eat them frozen, but they do hold their texture once thawed too.

review/summary: For whom are these marketed?
review/text: So, this is the thing: these bars are wheat-free and they taste ***good.*** But who cares about the whole wheat-free thing? I'll tell you who, folks who are wheat intolerant or allergic! So, it's all well and fine that this company is touting them as wheat free but they're made with oats as well as barley (gluten ingredients) so that's a big turn off. I don't get it. This product suggests that it is intended for a specialized market but it's made of ingredients that would prohibit purchasing it. Illogical. I wish Barbara's would make this product w/o the gluten so that I could buy it for my family! Meh!

review/summary: We love them, but not for everyone
review/text: Okay, we try as hard as we can to eat as little sugar and as little white flour as we can, but it is hard, one still needs sweets and snacks, especially with kids.  These are great, 100% whole wheat, and sweetened with fruit juice instead of a more refined sugar.  This may make me a bad mom, but on mornings when we are running late and I know we don't have time for a good and normal breakfast, I will give the girls one of these with milk, they're getting fruit and whole grain, so...  I say they are not for everyone because if you are used to Fig Newtons you will probably not like these, if you are not used to eating products for their whole grain content and lack of refined sugars, you probably won't like these.  I used to love Fig Newtons, but in a effort to be more healthy I gave them up and now only eat these, it has been long enough now that we have been eating healthier that I like the taste of these.  The girls knew no better, they had never had a real Fig Newton so had nothing to compare to and they just eat these up.  I don't know that we could go through a case of 6, we just buy one package at a time at our local Coborn's, and we don't go through them that fast as they are a treat not a daily thing or anything, so....

review/summary: Yummy with Christmas morning coffee & tea
review/text: Received our first case of Barbara's Blueberry Fig Bars a couple of days before Christmas. Once our guestssssss were awake and stirring, each had their choice of coffees or teas and I offered the fig bars as an accompaniment as I worked on getting breakfast prepared and on the table. Everyone loved the bars, even ME who is not typically a lover of blueberry flavored foods.  I had guests who hate FIG NEWTONS, but loved these. The first package was gone in a flash and I will open another tomorrow morning to buy me some time in the kitchen with breakfast prep once again.  I anticipate that after the Holidays, these will be a new addition to my IN THE CAR, morning COMMUTE, easy to eat breakfast items to have as I sip coffee along the route to work. Thanks for the great pricing Amazon!

I'm a single gal - so that means I'd have to chow down 2 of these packages each month just to consume them before they expire.<br /><br />For the health concious - these are fruit juice sweetened which means no white sugar is added! They are 60 calories per cookie with 13g of carbs, 1g Fiber, 8g sugar, and 1g of protein.<br /><br />I had to leave a rating of only 2 because of the taste - just "ok" for me. They have a very heavy flavour almost a slight fermented after taste to them. If you're a die hard fig lover, these might be for you but I personally prefer the whole wheat version by Nabisco

The expiration date was always just a few months away--but I love them and had no problem eating all six packages in a short time.<br /><br />This time, I got my shipment May 2009 and the cookies all had a "best used by March 09" date on them. So....Amazon has now sunk to shipping goods past their expiration date. I haven't eaten any of them yet---I kind of turned off by the idea they are two month beyond the date they should be taken off the shelf.<br /><br />I will  never buy these from Amazon again unless Amazon can assure me the product will be fresh.

review/summary: Misleading product name
review/text: This product may indeed be delicious but the product name is at the very least misleading, at worst deceptive. Anyone with celiac disease or other wheat intolerance needs to know that this product, though free of wheat, is made with multiple grains, including barley flour, and so is unsuitable for their use. Rightfully, the product should be named Multigrain Fig Bars as that is what they are. I don't see why anyone would specifically choose a wheat-free product over one containing wheat unless one is wheat intolerant (and therefore intolerant to all wheat-related grains). What possible legitimate reason could there be then to name this product "Wheat Free"? My rating of the product is based not on the product per se but on the unfortunate and misleading name Barbara's Bakery has chosen to give it. Please note also that a representative of Barbara's Bakery in a private communication to me in response to my objection to the name of this product stated there was no claim made that the product was gluten free then added that the few products Barbara's Bakery makes which it does claim to be gluten free are made in non-dedicated facilities which also process wheat. This is absurd as those products are subject to contamination with wheat and cannot legitimately be considered gluten free. It all comes down to a matter of truth in advertising. Where there is no truth in advertising what trust can there be in any of the products the company produces?

I wanted a snack for easy training and I would put them in my pocket for outdoor training, and like I said the puppy did eat them but didn't seem crazy for them. I did order the chicken and received the bacon but didn't return as I didn't want to go through that process and kept the bacon.

However, the title of this product on Amazon is Roasted Pecan Halves (1 Pound Bag) (Unsalted) - I must have missed that they roast the pecans in peanut oil in small print further down the page.<br /><br />The package says Unsalted Georgia Pecans -Ingredients: Pecans, Peanut Oil. K - Well I have never had pecans roasted in peanut oil.  When I took my first bite, I immediately noticed these pecans tasted strange to the point that the after taste required a glass of water to chase away the poor taste.<br /><br />I also ordered Unsalted Pistachios Meats - same thing - it was processed with peanut oil. They tasted poorly as well.<br /><br />This is the first time I am writing a poor review on an Amazon purchase. Thumbs down - these are the poorest tasting pecans and pistachios I have ever eaten. I will never order another product like this again.

review/summary: Decent, but not what I expected
review/text: These are wasabi peas, but not the "airy" texture that I was expecting like the ones from Japan.<br /><br />The Great Skott Great Scott Wasabi peas comes in six 8-oz individually wrapped bags. Shipping was fast from Amazon due to Amazon Prime (gotta love that). However, upon opening and eating these, the pea texture/consistency was not what I was expecting. I'm used to eating the wasabi peas from Japan (some combined in a snack mix from Harry/David) and the texture of those peas were more.....airy/light. I love that lighter texture, like a very light Whopper malt ball (if that makes sense).<br /><br />The peas from Great Skott are denser/harder (as another reviewer mentioned). It's like they took peas and dehydrated them, then coated with wasabi.<br /><br />Yes, these are wasabi peas (and probably healthier than eating Flamin' Hot Cheetos) but I didn't like the hardness and was afraid of cracking my teeth while trying to eat one of these ball bearings :-)

review/summary: Great tasting sausage
review/text: I just tried this manufacturer's sausage for the first time and must say  the quality, flavor, and easy open packs of this pork/beef sausage are excellent. The flavor is not overpowering but the taste of caraway really gives it a nice flavor boost. The outer casing is soft and not chewy or tough like so many sausage casings. In Wisconsin landjaeger is available for purchase in the southwest part of the state where there is a large community of Swiss/American residents who make this great sausage as part of their Swiss heritage. The sausage is a common meat product in Switzerland. But for those who love a good meat product in easy open packets who do not want to travel to Wisconsin or Switzerland, I would highly recommend this product for consumption. Great for lunch or just as a snack when you want something hearty with 0 grams of sugar and carbs.

review/summary: Best canned peas for the price
review/text: Note: These are not like fresh peas. If that is what you were hoping for you will be sadly disappointed. Canned food in general is much softer than fresh and the colors fade over time- think pale green. That being said, these peas are, IMO, a really good substitute and great pantry staple. The peas are small but quite sweet and wonderfully refreshing if chilled, no salt or sugar needed. In fact, I have eaten them straight out of the can and prefer them this way since they are delicate and too much cooking may break them down to mush. Food possibilities? ...Think pilaf (there's a recipe on the can) or pasta salads. You really can't go wrong with the low price. I know these are not organic and I'm not sure about the origin of the cans, but they don't taste metallic like other vegetables I have tried. In fact, I've even used the water from the can. One caveat: I ordered these with the Subscribe & Save option and many cans were dented. This hasn't affected the taste or product as far as I can tell but I don't appreciate it Amazon!<br />Nutrition: 60 calories, 1% sodium, Vitamin C 20% 4g protein per 1/2 cup serving.

review/text: Taste preferences vary, but I found this to be exactly right for those times when I wanted a mild caramel-flavored coffee.  I tried it at a friend's house and immediately ran out to Amazon to buy some.<br /><br />It has a light caramel taste - not overwhelming the way some flavored coffees can be. If you preferred a heavier caramel taste or only dark roasts, this blend won't please you.  However if you like the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend, you might also enjoy this one.  It has a similarly mild and easy taste.

Other gummies will say real fruit on the front of the package, but Welches acturally delivers.  Fructose is a monosacharide and is much preferred for GI tract health; as opposed to disacharides like corn syrup which is found in the the other gummies in the first ingredient. I will get these from amazon in the future to take on trips.

It has an amazingly good taste considering that it lacks sugar. Even tastes good when made with skim milk. It is also very easy to make, and the cost per serving, which works out to 35 cents per serving is incredibly low (but I think most folks will eat a larger serving than what is suggested on the box).  I also recommend the strawberry flavor of this product. However, the key lime flavor had a bit of an artificial taste to it.

I would find some pieces that my puppy didn't finish and they would be hardened, I found that a couple of times, it seemed to me that the puppy didn't devour the snack. I wanted a snack for easy training and I would put them in my pocket for outdoor training, and like I said the puppy did eat them but didn't seem crazy for them. I did order the chicken and received the bacon but didn't return as I didn't want to go through that process and kept the bacon.

review/text: My dogs LOVE these. They go crazy when i open them. They are a bit pick for clicker training, so i had to chop them up. But it was worth it because my dogs listened when they smelled them... I personally think they smell HORRIFIC. But... if it makes my dogs happy :)

review/summary: very dry
review/text: These are good treats and my dogs like them.  I don't like to use such dry crunchy treats for training, though, since the dogs need to take a while to chew them and can choke on them a bit if excited.  For training I prefer softer moister treats that I can break into smaller pieces but these are good for regular treats if a bit more expensive than others.
