review/summary: Its agar
review/text: I received the agar about 12 days after ordering. It comes in a slightly different bottle now, but I assume its the same agar agar as before. The bottle has a snap lid (I'm not so sure about the quality of the seal so I keep the agar agar in an airtight container just as a precaution). I dont plan on eating any of this, but I have used this successfully with mycology experiments in petri dishes (the agar is light enough to see everything well in the dish) so it works great for that.

review/summary: Great Vegan Alternative
review/text: Agar is basically gelatin for vegans, (or vegetarians.) Regular gelatin is usually animal-based, and is made from leftover body parts of animals that would otherwise be thrown away. Sound appetizing? Agar is a cruelty-free alternative, and is a great aid anytime a thickened creamy base is required, usually in baking. I use this for many cream pies as well as other desserts.

review/text: I haven't tried eating it. I bought it to make vegan DIY pore strips. It totally works! Hooray! I didn't have much luck when microwaving it, but if you boil it like it says on the bottle it firms up quite nicely. Bear in mind, you must add soy milk to make the pore strips. The agar simply doesn't have the ability on it's own.

review/summary: Very good coffee.
review/text: This is my sixth large bag of Eight O'Clock whole bean coffee  that I have ordered from Amazon over the past five months, and I have tried four different kinds, or flavors. All, except for the Hazelnut flavored coffee beans, were great.<br /><br />This bag of coffee beans, I'm glad to say, was excellent, as were four of the other two lb. bags. It is strong dark roast with a very smooth flavor. I am now a regular Eight O'Clock whole bean coffee lover of almost all of their different coffee beans. It is consistently good and is better than some coffee beans that I've paid twice as much for in my area.<br /><br />I only discovered it on Amazon last year, because in the Reno/Sparks area the Eight O'Clock Colombian whole bean coffee is only sold in WalMart stores, which I seldom visit. But now if I do run short of those beans, I can pay $1.00 less per 33 oz. bag at my local WalMart for this coffee than what Amazon charges.<br /><br />Update: June 23, 2011......Since I wrote this review the price of this coffee has doubled in price to almost $22.00 a bag on Amazon. I canceled my Subscribe & Save from Amazon last month and now buy it at my local WalMart for $14.97 per 33 ounce bag. Nothing wrong with the coffee, but maybe Amazon is closing out their grocery line business by charging much more than what local markets charge.

review/summary: 8 O'Clock vs Lavazza - The Winner Is????
review/text: Several months ago my coworkers and I opted to by a coffee grinder and beans to enhance our coffee experience at work.  At the time we were swapping back and forth between the locally produced Red Diamond ground coffee and Eight O'Clock ground coffee.  So when ordering the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SPEU">KRUPS 203-42 Electric Spice and Coffee Grinder with Stainless Steel blades, Black</a> we also chose to order this bag of Eight O'Clock coffee beans.  We immediately noticed the big difference in taste between ground coffee and freshly ground beans and we all loved the change.  It took the three of us a few months to go through this bag of coffee beans and as we were nearing the bottom, we decided to try other brands of beans.  So we bought a bag of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SDKDM4">Lavazza Super Crema Espresso Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2-Pound Bag</a> and had ourselves a 2 day double blind taste test.  I ground up fresh beans from the Lavazza, Red Diamond beans we bought at a local grocery store, and the Eight O'Clock beans.  All three bags of beans were freshly opened only a day or three apart.  I measured each coffee equally and ran it through our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F49XXG">De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker</a>.  I presented each of the coffees to two different coworkers for comparison and opinions.  Without them knowing which coffee was which, the general consensus was our local favorite was not anywhere near the quality and flavor as the Lavazza and the Eight O'Clock.  Our taste tests placed Lavazza slightly behind the Eight O'Clock with flavor being the only measure.  Once we also took into consideration that the Eight O'Clock coffee was not a blend like Lavazza and it cost half the price, we all decided the Eight O'Clock 100% Columbian Whole Bean coffee was definitely the better choice for us.

review/summary: Like Dark Roast but Not Bitter or Harsh and Very Sooth
review/text: I just started drinking Eight o'Clock coffees.  On the recommendation of a friend, I purchased the Columbian style roast.  WOW!  This stuff is great.  It's like jet fuel strong but not burnt, harsh or bitter.  This isn't a fake 'burnt' roast strong like Starbucks but is smooth and flavorful without the harshness.  I'm wide awake after this stuff.  I dream about my morning cup the night before...yes, I like it that much.<br /><br />Their regular roast is good too but hard to describe how it differs from the Columbian.  It is hard to pick between the two.

review/text: I've been drinking this coffee fand Columbian or years.  One person said it tasted like Maxwell House??  Gotta stop smoking crack pal.  Nothing like it.<br />I hate Star"BUCKS" coffee so this is a perfect blend for me. Not too weak not to strong.  It's almost identicl to Wlamart's price.  I am going with Amazon for two reasons.  Walmart is always out of it (out of a lot of things and it's less than a amile away) and I won't run out since I started a monthly shipment and have to make a special trip to THAT place (Walmart here is run  by people right off the boat and the place is a disaster).  Kinda creepy.<br />Anyway, if you haven't tried eighto'clock, I think yo'll be surprised.  Consumer Reports gave it the #1 recommendation a few years back.<br /><br />Cheers!

review/text: I bought some of this coffee on a whim since I had seen a good review score on Amazon. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this coffee. This stuff is stale. Despite buying whole bean, grinding right before use, and using a French press, it still tasted bad. It's not horrible but honestly it tastes like mass produced ground coffee, maybe just a little better than a can of Folgers. The beans seemed to have no oils and it was just incredibly bland. Even Starbucks beans are better than this coffee. I'd skip this one if you are a real coffee lover.

review/text: I'm no coffee expert to me coffee is coffee boy was I wrong. I have the Keurig k cup coffee maker and love it but the k cups can get costly. I was told I should buy a reusable filter for that coffee maker and use my own coffee, so I thought I would try whole bean coffee and grind it my self and save a few $$ on k cups. I wasn't sure on what brand of beans to buy never bought whole bean coffee before. I like Colombian coffee I seen this brand and took a chance and bought it and I'm glad I did, the aroma just opening the bag made the house smell like a coffee shop even the non coffee drinkers loved the smell. I ground some beans up extra fine because I like my coffe a little stronger & brewed a cup. I must say that it was about the best coffee I've ever tasted besides starbucks & donut shop k cups that I use in fact its better then the donut shop brand k cup coffee. the beans were very fresh and came in a vacuumed sealed bag like I said I'm no coffee expert but this is VERY GOOD COFFEE I LOVE IT. I know every one has different tastes some might like it and some not I my self love this coffee and will be buying more.

It is good enough that it makes you feel good for the amount of money that you spent.  It does not taste burnt or over-roasted like most of the bargain priced coffee and it isn't weak in the flavor department either.  If you do some comparison shopping here on Amazon you will find a pretty decent deal with the subscribe and save program. I would recommend it to friends and family.

review/text: First time for me grinding whole beans. I liked this coffee, has a rich coffee flavor, but smooth taste. Lot better than other store bought ground coffee. Taste just as fresh at the end of the bag as when you first open it. The smell of the coffee is great, like real coffee.<br /><br />A smaller 22oz. bag of this coffee at Publix is about the same price or more than this 33oz. bag, so good deal.<br /><br />I have been putting my coffee in the freezer, but this 8 O'Clock coffee bag says not to put it in the freezer or frig? So maybe that's why my other coffee I put in the freezer hardly has any coffee smell to it? I was under the presumption that the freezer preserves the freshness?<br /><br />But at any rate, very good coffee. I am not a coffee officiano, but I like this coffee.

review/text: Been buying 100% Colombian coffee from eight o'clock but tastes like burnt roast like Star-Broke-Us lately.  If this is how eight o'clock will now roast their coffee I will try other brands.  Will try original once to see if better but if not eight o'clock has lost a 40 year customer forever... Would recommend to friends but know I would not...Has product changed or is Amazon selling a inferior product???

review/text: Both the taste and the smell are not fresh. The other 1-2 star reviews are absolutely right in that the beans lack oils, the coffee bean smell, and rich taste.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this product; spent the extra few dollars on either Cafe Altura or the Kicking Horse brands.

review/text: We love the Eight O'clock columbian Supreme coffee beans for our coffee.  Been buying them for a long time.  Try other beans that are good, but like Eight O'Clock the best. Makes a good pot of coffee. We don't like real dark roasted, strong coffee beans. These are flavorful, without being bitter or too strong when brewed.

review/summary: Great coffee for the price
review/text: I have been drinking 8'oclock coffee for a long time, but had always purchased it at the local grocery store. It is a very good, medium-bodied Colombian roast that is about as good as it gets for the money. Unfortunately, the grocery store price kept creeping up over time and now it's like $7 for a single 11 ounce bag. This is a steal compared to that, especially if you get it with the 15% subscribe and save discount.

review/summary: Consistent, Flavorful, The Best Taste For The Price.
review/text: We live in times of the cult of coffee, the esoterica of so-called best brands shoved down our throats, snobbery, trend appeal, hipsters, fancy names, fancy packaging, high prices, and in the end, when boiled down, most of it's good old fashioned hype. Basically, like anything else...someone trying to sell a product because they have bills to pay...car loans...kids to put through college.<br /><br />I have gone through the phases of coffee drinking, experimenting with different brands, brewing methods, grinding methods, blah, blah blah. I have tried most, if not all the major brands out there and I'm tired. In the end, this brand stands out. It's refreshing to know that an old time favorite like Eight O Clock Whole Bean Columbian still exists. No hype. Consistent taste. Fair priced. EZ prep. It taste better with food too. I just drank a fresh ground cup with a piece of homemade coconut cake and enjoyed a little moment of nirvana. Take what you can get in this life. Push the hype to the side.

review/text: Nice fresh coffee that I grind myself every AM in my Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill.  I used to buy this coffee in bulk when the local supermarket put it on sale for half price.  They stopped their sale so I started buying it from Amazon.  One bag lasts me exactly one month, so Amazons subscribe and Save Plan works perfectly.  I didn't realize how much better really fresh coffee tastes.  I also recommend the Cuisinart Grinder which I bought at a local store.  You can find the grinder on amazon. The URL is in comment 1.

review/text: Eight O'Clock Coffee's 100% Colombian is my favorite of all the "sold in stores" coffees. Shopping for special offers on Amazon and then ordering in bulk make the prices right. I shop the 4 pack 11oz vs 40oz bag vs 33oz bag and figure in coupons for the best per oz price and then make an order. (Yeah, that's a lot of work, but I save a lot of money). My favorite overall coffee comes from The Coffee Fool. It is so fresh that it never leaves the coffee after taste. But it is way to expensive for my regular use.

review/text: Supermarket and buyers club beans are within my price range and what Iam used to, so with that in mind Eight O'Clock Coffee is at the top for taste and value. Since this is a blend of beans you sometimes find a mixture of slightly different sizes and colors - don't let it bother you, I believe this is the way they maintain a consistent product. Oh yes I buy from Amazon but only when it's cheaper than other sources which it occasionally is. With "subscribe and save" the last shipment was $.36 per oz.

review/text: Eight O'Clock whole been coffee has been a favorite of mine for years.  I grind enough for the week and keep it in an air tight jar.  The Eight O'Clock Coffee Company has different style beans available to suit all tastes. While I prefer the colombian bean style, which has a rich, bold balanced flavor, the milder smooth french roast is also a great choice.<br />  So, whats better than a great cup of coffee first thing in the morning?  Its a good coffee at a great price delivered to your door every month!  The price offered for the subscription service was to good to pass up.  Though I was a bit hesitant to click, I'm glad I did!  Coffee comes every month, but not before I get an email from Amazon asking; if I still want the subscription, do you need an extra bag, do you have to much right now and want to skip a month?  The 33-once bag is the perfect size for my needs and at $11 it beats Walmart's price by $7.00!

review/text: I have swithced to this coffee from Millstone brand. I drank Millstone for several years and then tried this coffee. This coffee does not have the flowery after taste as the other and is rich in taste to me. The price is right too. The Eight O'Clock coffee sells in the stores in my area for between six to seven dollars for eleven ounce bags. I always buy the whole bean coffee and grind my own. I only have a blade grinder and not a burr, and these beans grind up very uniformly in my little grinder. I recommend this coffee in the big bag if you drink a lot of coffee like me. It is a real money saver.

review/summary: I'm in love again...
review/text: I'll start by saying that this coffee is awesome. I started liking Colombian coffee the first time I brewed a cup of Yuban. The taste was just what I wanted in a cup of coffee. It's not bitter, smells great, smooth and most interestingly, it has a very unique taste to it. I was in love. However, shortly after, Yuban changed and the flavor changed as well. I was very disappointed to say the least. I looked for a long time to invest in my next brand of Colombian coffee and stumbled upon Eight O' Clock. I have never heard of this brand and after some research, there was a lot of positive things said of it.<br /><br />I was very happy to find that they had 100% Colombian coffee and most importantly, in whole bean. I could never find whole beans for Yuban. I don't even know if they exist for consumers to purchase. Being a little over $10, I decided to finally take the risk and go for it. After just finishing my first cup, I think I will be sticking to this coffee for a long time. Just as long as they don't change it. It has that very strong "Colombian" taste which I so love and once again, it's not bitter and it doesn't feel like a chore to finish a cup like how I would with other types of coffee.<br /><br />Everyone's got different taste, especially when it comes to coffee. If you don't like it, fine. Try something else. For about $10, this was a steal for me. No doubt, this is not what you would consider "premium" coffee but as long as you enjoy it, who the heck cares? I remember reading that this coffee won the Consumer's Choice award for best tasting coffee in I believe a year or so ago. So far, I believe it.

From the beginning I have been very pleased with this coffee. I have paid my dues over the years with regard to not-very-good coffees, and I am happy to have this as my usual every morning. It is consistently fresh, and had never disappointed me. Just remember, though, coffee is a very personal thing and everyone has their own preferences.<br /><br />I bought this through Amazon when I found a great price through Subscribe and Save, and will continue to do so if the price stays consistent.

review/text: I'm not sure what happened to my other review, but it didn't go through.  This 8 O'clock coffee is sour and bitter, no matter much much or little coffee I add, and no matter how much water I put.  It was like this the first day I got it.  I try coffee I buy from Lucky's or Costco and it's nothing like this.  This is the worst coffee I ever taste.  It's so bad that if I had to do it all over again, I would ask for a refund.  I keep the beans in an airtight mason jar.  Like I said, day one and it was sour and bitter so I gotta write this review.  Google around and you'll see people say the same.  I am not sure if I have a bad batch or what.<br /><br />I've also read that pretty much all coffee roasted coffee bean you buy has gone stale in about 2 or so weeks after roasting.  I've recently ordered green coffee beans and will be roasting it myself.  I've tried a few bags of pre-roasted beans, they're nothing special, but this one is just awful.  I've now decided to cold press this 8 O'clock coffee to see if i can improve the taste and finish it.

review/text: I don't get the hype about this stuff. Maybe the consumer reports phenomenon struck - they rated this highly a while ago, but CR does get stuff horribly wrong on a regular basis (read the user reviews).  I used to think 8 o-clock bean was pretty good until I started tasting premium coffees such as starbucks columbia and peet's major dickasons, which are in a class of there own compared to this.  You can get Kirkland house blend 2 lb bag for the same price at Costco, and it's far superior to this.  You can find Cameron's organic on Amazon for not much more than 8 o-clock bean, their french roast is world's better.<br /><br />I simply can't imagine buying this when there are much better quality beans for about the same price.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: This is my first review of any Amazon product.  I recognize that everyone's palate is different so reviewing taste is rather subjective. I have good memories of Eight O'Clock coffee from years ago when I lived on the east coast.  I was disappointed when I drank this.  I did not find it as enjoyable as I expected but rather mediocre.  My favorite type of coffee is Colombian bean and I have tried Colombian beans anywhere from my grocery stores bulk coffee bin to expensive Gevalia coffee.  Since this is my preferred coffee type, I am trying to find one that I can consistently enjoy,which fits my meager budget.  I was hoping this would be it but it did not fit the bill. I've tried several Amazon offers and thus far Folgers Gourmet Selection Lively Colombian Whole Bean is by far the best for me but unfortunately I am unable to get it through subscribe and save any longer.  I'm not sure that this review will influence any coffee drinkers decision making process but it was fun to write!!

review/summary: Stale?
review/text: I've had this brand from Amazon b4. Was great, np. LOVED it!<br /><br />But recently this brand (from walmart most recently) was revisited and compared.<br /><br />This used to be a top notch product but now sometthings changes and my last 3bags were tasteless crud.<br /><br />To scientifically make sure I didn't do something wrong Know that ALL equipment is the same and other brands perform normal with them. Grind coarsness, water temp, container, brew time, ect...A double dose of finer grounds presses some sorta tinted tasteless water.<br /><br />There is NO WAY they can stay in business like this. I'm sure some changes will be made.<br /><br />Cons that are true:<br />discolored lite beans<br />No amount of coffee improves anything<br />No aroma when bag first opened<br />New packaging may be flawed (air valve)<br />Seems stale<br /><br />Amazon has always appeased me but this company has some very real issues.<br /><br />Stear clear until things straighten up? I advise to always pay attention to dates on reviews. Alot of positive comments on these guys is in years past. Recent blogs are negative across the boards.

review/text: My roommate purchased this for our household. First batch we made was sour. I thought it was a fluke since it had gotten such good reviews. I made a few more batches but all the coffee brewed from this brand was really sour - to a point that it was undrinkable. Maybe we were unfortunate to get an unfresh bag. It's was a waste of 2lbs of coffee beans.

review/text: Love this coffee, ordered it several times before from Amazon with no problems. This time was a TOTAL disaster, opened the box upon delivery and 32 ounces of coffee beans went all over my kitchen, in the carpet and everything in the box smelled of coffee beans. Forty five minutes of cleaning up and still think I may have ruined my vacuum cleaner trying to get the beans out of the carpet...  WHAT A HUGE MESS! A scrapbook was in the order that may forever more smell like coffee.. Not sure the reason but two of the packages of coffee were packaged tightly and securely in a separate plastic bag and two of the bags of coffee were just thrown in the box. SO dissapointed.

review/summary: Not Stage 3 Quality. Very thin
review/text: I use jar foods when I am on the go or if I did not have time to leave the babysitter food. I made a majority of my twins food from scratch using the baby bullet, a chopper or just by mashing it. Now that my twins are 11months they have been eating table food. I was excited to see that Earth's best made Stage 3 foods.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this Particular Stage 3 option (Earth's Best Junior Baby Food Organic Chunky Orchard Fruit, 6-Ounce Jars) is not Stage 3 quality. It is very thin comparable to the Stage 2 food. It does have a few small tiny tiny pieces of fruit in it but nothing compared to the other stage 3 thicknesses. Seeing as my twins are used to have bigger thicker pieces of food they eat the food off the spoon so quickly.<br />As with all Earth's best I love the quality of the food and my twins love the taste. However, I would not have purchased if I knew it would be so thin.

She seems to like it a lot. I heat it up for 20 seconds in the microwave to make it warm oatmeal. I like the fact that this oatmeal has a lot of iron in it, which is necessary for a growing toddler!!

review/summary: Disgusting! :(
review/text: I bought this for my baby (since she didn't have teeth at the time) thinking that it would be a good source of iron. Unfortunately, the ingredients did not mention that there are RAISINS in this product. The combination of apples, raisins and cinnamon is not a good idea at all. My baby actually started gagging when I put a spoonful in her mouth. When I tasted it myself, I felt like doing the same. This mixture is just too sweet because of the raisins. There is also a very strong flavor of cinnamon. I usually add some cinnamon to the food she eats so I know that she likes cinnamon if its in a normal quantity. I tried diluting the flavor in several ways, but it's no use. The cinnamon flavor was still too strong. I still have about 8 more jars to experiment with. I'm thinking I'll give it one more try by mixing apple puree with a little bit of this mixture and see if the baby will take it or not. Otherwise, it's all going in the trash. I hate wasting food but there doesn't seem to be another option.

Remember, like any food product, the liquid separates sometimes and you just have to stir the food.  No big deal.  Problem solved.  If you still have an issue with it, I would recommend adding a few drops of water or formula to the food. Then stir again.

review/summary: My Skinny Cat Daryl likes it!
review/text: I have been trying to find a food that is not full of dyes and fillers that my cats will eat. All are formal ferals. Funny thing, They would eat anything & Everything when they were wild.  Now they have developed a discriminating taste bud. Daryl was very overweight, but suddenly went 17 pounds to 8, in 8 months. After spending $ on blood tests, fecal tests etc, nothing is abnormal according to the Vet. (he is 6, not an old cat). His stools were smelly and yellow when he was on the cat foods that the supermarket carries. He had an accident (because he was so frightened) at the Vets..she stated, that was the worst bowl movement she ever smelled from any animal patient she had, ever..(we knew as soon as Dary'l left the litterbox, even upstairs and down are large, in the cats special "bathroom room) and had plastic bags there just waiting to get it out of there fast)<br /><br />He recently started to avoid the commercial cat foods (I bought at the supermarket) and steal/gorge on table scraps such as chicken and salmon, then vomit it up soon thereafter. Two of the other cats would eat some of the commercial brands, then vomit.<br />(I was buying the higher end, well know major brands, all from little tiny cans to foil packs, not generic)<br /><br />I am hoping it is just a developed food allergy to the junk in commercial cat food brands.<br /><br />I bought several cases of various better "natural" brands off Amazon this month , relying on customer reviews. It has only been a week , but He (and the other five) Do like this Tiki Brand. The fact that they eat it, and it does not wind up on my floor (and sometimes on the bottom of my foot) is a blessing! Daryl's litter is not smelling as bad. Daryl has not vomited as much, and he likes the fishy varieties of this brand. He is not eating as before he lost weight, but I give him a little, he finishes it, later more etc..WE are hoping this new diet is the answer. We hope he gains weight back.<br />The food from this company looks more like parts of fish..something an animal should be eating.<br />I will keep you posted on his health update!<br />He also likes the wild salmon flavor.They will lick the chicken flavor, but do not finish it<br />Just glad they eat most of this ..they have Fromms dry available at all times, so that is perhaps the reason they are so picky, and not inhaling the canned varieties.

review/summary: Tiki Cat
review/text: Tiki Cat is by far my cats' favorite food - they absolutely love it! They especially love the salmon and tuna flavors. It is expensive compared to other brands, so I buy it by the case to get the volume discount.

review/summary: Flavorful Soy Sauce
review/text: This seems to be the Japanese version of Kikkoman soy sauce, seems to be more full flavored and darker then the weaker American version. A little goes a long way making it more economical.
