review/summary: Great Coffee!
review/text: Take it from someone who was tried a lot of different K-cups, BUY THESE! The "Breakfast in Bed" blend is full of great flavor, roasted perfectly, and more importantly I have been choosing it over Green Mountain, which says a lot. It's true to its name, perfect for the morning.

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: Reading the previous comments people have stated they did not know this was a flavored coffee but it clearly states that it is. Atleast it did on the sight I bought mine from. I was only brought to Amazon for the secure payment feature. It's a delightful flavored coffee, (depending on how you brew it), and is a pleasant wake up any morning.

review/summary: coconut in the morning?
review/text: I did not know this had a coconut flavor or aroma as I got it in a variety pack. I put it in this am and immediately smelled coconut and thought oh no I don't like sweet in the AM. But its not sweet, I am quite surprised at the flavor and how I like it. Would I like it every morning..NO but it was a nice change. Made me feel I was waking up in a Jamacian cottage on the ocean hearing carribean music, well maybe not but it was close

review/summary: Sorry Wolfgang!
review/text: I love my Keurig coffee maker. And I enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGDM">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Creme Caramel, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> seemed to be a safe choice. I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. It's not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the 'small cup' setting, the aroma is very nice, but the taste is a bit watery. 'Black', the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste, but it didn't add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting. In short; the coffee taste is very mild, and the caramel taste isn't all that great. Sorry Wolfgang, but I'm afraid this one is a yawner.

review/text: There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said. But when I brewed this coffee I really wasn't expecting to like it at all, seeing as I don't normally like coconut flavored things. But I really like the blend of flavors. To me it doesn't really taste like coconut as much as it does just tropical-ness in general. It's like.. palm tree flavored coffee. And the flavor isn't too overpowering at all, it still has a nice coffee taste. It's just right.

This is my third "taste test" searching for the best vanilla flavored coffee.  Gloria Jean's was undrinkable.  Timothy's was pleasant but not as deep a roast as this. If it only had more vanilla flavor this would be my hands down favorite.

review/summary: Yum!!
review/text: I am not a huge morning coffee person as this seems to be the only time of day black coffee upsets my stomach. No idea why. My work got a Keurig recently and buy the Caribou regular and morning blends, which are ok but I can hardly drink them unless there's a creamer of some sort in them.<br /><br />So on a recent trip to BB&B I perused their wall of K-cups and this one caught my eye. I am generally a fan of flavored coffees and this sounded good, so I bought an 18 cup pack. I have to say it is delicious! The coconut flavor is light but definitely there, and doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste like most black coffees do. It smells so good my co-workers have done a 180 walking by my desk to ask me what smells so good.<br /><br />Obviously if you're a coffee connoisseur this won't be for you, but if not it is definitely worth a shot. And the best part for me, aside from the flavor, no stomach upset!

review/summary: An EXCELLENT hazelnut choice for your Keurig brewer...
review/text: I've long been a fan of flavored coffees so when we got our Keurig brewer we jumped on the opportunity to sample as many different flavors of k cups as possible.  Our first foray into the single-serve hazelnut world was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZKI">Gloria Jean's Coffees,Hazelnut K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, which was absolutely awful.  We've always enjoyed hazelnut coffee in the past, though, and vowed not to give up.  I ordered a sample pack of Wolfgang Puck's hazelnut directly from Keurig's website and hoped for the best.<br /><br />Thankfully, Hawaiian Hazelnut blows all of the other hazelnut k cups out of the water.  It is smokey and delicious without being dark and overwhelming.  The hazelnut really does taste like actual hazelnut, which you'd think would be something a coffee drinker could take for granted, but we've been disappointed in the past.  I'd never tried coffee from the Wolfgang Puck brand before, but our positive experience with Hawaiian Hazelnut has definitely gotten me interested in trying other varieties.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavor is pretty bold and full bodied, which is nice, but there is no bitterness or acidity to be found.  This suits me just fine since I enjoy a milder roast, but people who enjoy their coffee strong and dark might not enjoy this blend as much.<br /><br />We'll definitely be repurchasing this coffee when we run out.

I now see other reviews stating they had defective cups as well. However the taste of the coffee is good.

review/text: Jamaica Me Crazy is a sweet, coconut flavored coffee that has a mild aftertaste.  It is not a bold blend, but rather a mild to medium blend that leans more mild.<br /><br />This is certainly not a first cup of morning coffee for die-hard coffee drinkers who lean towards the medium to bold blends.  I would consider it a second cup of morning coffee, afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee.<br /><br />Flavor is OK.  I would like it better if the aftertaste didn't linger.  For a flavored coffee, it isn't bad & if you are a coconut fan, it is a blend to try on for size.

review/text: I just recently got a Keurig coffee maker & registered it online.  Keurig sent me a coupon for buy 2 boxes, get 2 free.  Awhile back, a local bagel shop had a coconut coffee that I fell in love with.  So, I decided to try this coffee out because it has coconut in it.  I brewed my first cup this morning & it smelled VERY strong of coconut so of COURSE I couldn't wait to try it.  After it cooled down a bit I took my first sip.  AMAZING!!  It is quite delightful & I STRONGLY recommend it if you like coconut coffee.  No bitter aftertaste, either & no soot @ the bottom of my cup.  Awesome

review/text: I have at least 4 dozen different k-cups at my house right now because we love to experiment with different flavors.  My favorite is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso because I like a bold coffee.  But others that prefer something milder say that Breakfast in Bed is their favorite.  I like it to but only when made as a stronger brew.  I have purchased maybe 15 boxes of this since it came out.

review/summary: Superb coffee
review/text: I'm actually suprised from reading some of the rants about this coffee.  I have tried 20+ K-cup varieties and this is by far my favorite.  Contrary to some reviews, I don't find it to be weak at all and in fact, is quite bold but with absolutely not hints of being bitter.  Very smooth and leaves a great aftertaste.  I prefer really strong coffee and this is a good compromise for a medium roast as it's not as bold as I would normally prefer but certainly strong enough to satisfy my preferences.<br /><br />I typically drink Wolfgang's Jamaica Me Crazy but ever since trying Rodeo Drive, I haven't gone back.

review/text: I Recently bought a 3 pack of this coffee at Bed Bath and Beyond. As its brewing, it smells great (if you like coconut).  The taste isn't bad, but for me, it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have. I gave it 3 stars because it's not terrible. But I wouldn't buy this coffee again. If you're sensitive to after taste, I wouldn't recommend. I'd Grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee.

review/text: I am usually not a fan of flavored coffe or coconut for that matter and when I bought the sampler pack of Jamaica Me Crazy I honestly did not see that it was a flavored coffee.  The aroma that it gives off while brewing transports me to a tropical island somewhere.  The flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all.  A great new addition to my coffee line up.

Compared to Folgers, this product is awesome. Unfortunately for Mr. Puck, I am comparing it to Green Mountain Sumatra.<br /><br />The organic and free trade Sumatra from Green Mountain is better to my taste, and it is cheaper.

review/summary: I really like this one!
review/text: Taste is a personal thing, isn't it.  So I'll just tell you(as a gauge) my all time favorite K-cup is Timothy's Midnight Magic a "california roast" (which is dark). I'm partial to dark roasts and probably would not have even bothered with this Sorrento, but a friend had it, so I tried it, and lo and behold - I'm very glad I did. I find this blend even better than Puck's "Kopei Ray" which is his dark roast. There's a whole lot of good flavor here - the word "luscious" comes to mind. This one's not available every where and comes at a slight cost premium. I say it's worth it. These will be a regular for me. PS: A suggestion (which seems apparent); as with any k-cup, when you try a new blend, use the plain old 1 cup setting to check it out undiluted the first time.

review/summary: Not my favorite, but it came in second
review/text: My hair dresser's salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups. K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.<br /><br />The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgang Puck, Timothy's, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).<br /><br />Everyone's taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far. Wolfgang Puck was my second favorite. So far, I like Folgers the best.<br /><br />FOLGERS GOURMET<br />SELECTIONS LIVELY COLOMBIAN<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 36 for $25)<br />Earthy flavor, fruity and nutty flavors come through.<br /><br />WOLFGANG PUCK CHEFS RESERVE COLOMBIAN DARK ROAST<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 48 for $32.98)<br />A dark roast with caramel and earthy notes, slight burnt<br />and papery flavors.<br /><br />TIMOTHY'S DECAFFEINATED COLOMBIAN MEDIUM<br />Price per cup: 60 cents (package of 50 for $30)<br />A bit on the weak side, kind of papery, and less astringent than the others.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Excellent smooth, light coffee.  Good anytime.
review/text: Definately not what I'd expected with the Wolfgang Puck name on it.  To me, Wolfgang Puck has conotations of a heavy, dark-roast European-style coffee.  I thought I'd already found my perfect coffee in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GV68">Timothy's World Coffee, Breakfast Blend for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> but this one edges it out.  Smooth and balanced it really is great from the first sip till the last drop.<br /><br />There will never be a coffee that all coffee lovers will agree on but if you like a light-medium roast, give the Breakfast in Bed blend a try.  Very low in acidity, someone who can't tolerate the acidity in coffee may be able to enjoy this blend.  But, be aware and contrary to popular belief, light roast coffee is typically higher in caffine than the dark roast coffees, the extended roasting to produce a dark roast burns away some of the caffine. This one will definately get you going in the morning in a good way.<br /><br />Those who prefer a dark roast or extra bold should probably look elsewhere.

Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this.  Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I don't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale.

There is no bitter taste, no funny chemical taste you get with so many flavored coffees, no odd aftertaste.  It's just a mellow, gorgeous, hazelnut-with-a-touch-of-the-islands cup of coffee.  Outstanding.  My favorite I've ever tried, and I've tried most!

review/summary: Not as good
review/text: This is very good coffee, but it doesn't have as much flavor as the Van Houttes creme caramel.  If your looking for something that has a lot of flavor, go with the other.  If you are looking for something that is more coffee than flavor, this is it.

review/text: By far,this is the best flavored K cup coffee I've ever had. Good body, not bitter, no flowery aroma (like with the Green Mountain flavored K cups). I like my coffee a little stronger than Puck's Hawaiian Hazelnut, but it is certainly a fine, medium bodied,coffee I could drink over and over.

review/summary: Mmm, mm, great coffee aroma!
review/text: While looking for a top rated vanilla K-cup, I stumbled upon this combination flavored cup that was rated higher than any of the vanilla flavored cups at that time.  I took a chance and ordered a double pack from Amazon and was pleasantly surprised. This is a rich tasting medium/light roasted flavor that appeals to several coffee drinkers at our house. There is a hint of built in sweetness so that additional sweeteners are not necessary for those of us who don't care for super sweet coffee. I would classify this as a medium roast and tastes best with the medium sized cup selections on our Keurig Coffee Brewer<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System</a>. People who prefer extra bold coffees would need to use two of these K-cups to make one extra large travel mug of coffee.<br />  That said, we have found that mixing this flavor with other flavors to make an extra large serving is a most enjoyable pastime at our house. The most popular combo's so far are Jamaica me Crazy with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00395DVQS">Van Houtte French Vanilla K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, Hazlenut<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00395574M">Van Houtte Hazelnut Decaffeinated K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> or Costa Rican<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ4I">Van Houtte Caf&eacute;, Costa Rica Tarrazu (Light Roast), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>. In the end, This is one of the most versatile flavors for those of us who have frequent visitors and several palettes to please.

review/text: This coffee is surprisingly delicious. We never had a problem with the k-cups bursting; maybe it is a defect on the coffee brewer..? This coffee is a bit less strong than we normally prefer our coffee but it makes up with great taste. Look forward to my mug every morning. Would definitely recommend it and will buy it again.

review/text: Probably because it doesn't taste like coffee.  It is flavorless.  I saw the good reviews and thought I'd get a couple boxes and now I'm stuck with a bunch of k cups that I don't want to drink because I'd rather literally drink any other k cup I've ever tried.  As you can see I'm not a fan of these k cups.  These are the worst ever.

review/summary: Unremarkable
review/text: First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.

review/text: I have tried many brands of medium roast coffees however, this is my favorite. Some I've tried are bitter; some are too light; some are too strong; but this one for me is just right! Some brands more than others come in all puffed up and when punctured, the grounds filter out into the needle of the Keurig coffee maker and has to be cleaned which isn't difficult, just annoying. Never had a problem with these.  Breakfast in Bed k-cups are smooth, not too light and not too strong, right smack in the midddle. No bitter after taste either and perfect any time of day. Enjoy!

review/summary: Either I got a bad batch or....
review/text: ...or the good reviewers' taste buds are weak.  This is some disappointingly<br />weak coffee.  I'm not some crazy "gotta have my jet black sludge to get<br />through the day" coffee drinker - I'd say my favorite (and my wife's) is<br />Caribou Blend.  This blend is WEAK, it can't hold half-and-half or even<br />just whole milk without being wiped out.  Now, I will say I brew it on<br />the "large cup" (9.25 oz, I believe) setting on our Keurig, so maybe it's<br />a bit better on the 8oz setting, or even the small setting.  But Caribou (we<br />also like Donut Shop, Green Mountain Kona Blend 10%, etc.) can be easily<br />brewed on 9.25 and hold a good bold taste.  This coffee doesn't<br />hold a CANDLE to any of those.  Now I'm stuck with 40+ of these. Blech...maybe<br />the guests won't mind it! :)
