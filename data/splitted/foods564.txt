review/summary: I like it - I'll buy it!
review/text: Clear arrived just as my other product was all gone, so I was ready to give it a good try.  I have short, gray-silver, rather thin hair, so I'm always looking for something to "pump" it up and give it some body.  This shampoo really works - I like the way it cleans, leaving hair squeaky clean - and, with my usual blow-dry, I was definitely sporting a more "poofy" style.  My hair didn't flatten out the way it usually does the next day, so it looks like I've found my new root-boosting shampoo!

review/summary: Cleans well and doesn't give oily rebound
review/text: When I first saw the shampoo I was skeptical- it looked the consistency of white hand lotion and I was afraid it would hold down my fine hair.  But it doesn't. The smell is light and the shape of the shampoo container is opposite of the conditioner so people with bad eyes won't confuse them while in the shower without glasses. It is too soon to know if this will help hair grow by nourishing the roots but when used with the matching conditioner and a blow-dryer it seems to have a lasting lift.  I've used it twice. Will report back if there is long term hair growth (although that might be more than a shampoo can do.)

review/summary: Creamy, pleasant shampoo -- leaky bottle detracts
review/text: I used CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo for about a week.  It's a very creamy shampoo, and a little goes a very long way. I have long, thin hair, and I like shampoos that don't weight it down, but make it feel fuller and lusher.  This did that.  There is a floral scent, which may or may not be pleasing to all users.  I found it stronger in the bottle than on my hair, which was left gently scented after blow drying.<br /><br />I did use this with the companion conditioner, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UM">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>, so I can't comment on whether or not the shampoo on its own works to "volumize" hair.  The label does suggest massaging the shampoo into the scalp (to nourish the roots) -- I did this, but whether it works or not will be determined over time.<br /><br />The leaky bottle seems to be an issue with most of the reviewers here.  The shampoo arrived wrapped in plastic, and then in bubble wrap.  The bottle has one of those push-down lids, which is simply too loose to seal properly for shipment.  I didn't lose as much of the product as some reviewers did, but the bottle was a sticky mess that had to be cleaned off before using.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a serviceable shampoo that left my hair feeling soft and full.

review/summary: I do not use scented shampoo so I won't be able to try Clear shampoo
review/text: I had seen commercials recently on TV for Clear Shampoo. My hair used to be oily and thin but with age has become more dry and frizzy. When I saw this was available through the Vine program I ordered it. I'm always looking for the next best shampoo. It was packaged in a padded envelope. When I started to open the flap I could smell a strong scent in the package. The shampoo bottle itself was wrapped in plastic so if by chance the bottle was punctured shampoo would not leak out. The shampoo is made to come out of a small hole in the top of the flip-top. I realize since it was in the package the scent was concentrated but nevertheless I did not like it. I am sensitive to smells so generally don't use scented products, especially shampoo. Others may not find the scent bothersome but that is not the case for me. I won't be using the shampoo because of it so I will not be able to provide any further review of it.

review/summary: Not the greatest
review/text: I have seen the commercials for this product on tv, and so, I was excited when I saw I could try it for free on Amazon Vine. I was not at all happy with this product.<br /><br />First, when I received this product, it had a plastic bag over the top. But it was completely open on the bottom and not sealed on at all. As a result, about a 1/3 of the shampoo leaked into the envelope.<br /><br />Second, I tried this product for about 5 days. I really liked the scent of this shampoo and was anxious to try it. But this shampoo is extremely thick and goopy. It is very hard to rinse completely out of your hair. Even though I was only using a quarter-sized amount at a time, this product left my hair very dull, heavy, and greasy looking. my hair is very thick and I have a lot of it, and it does tend to be oily, so I don't typically use conditioner. After several days, this prodct made my hair look like I hadn't washed for a while. Needless to say, I have stopped using this product and gone back to my old shampoo. I was not all happy with this product and wouldn't recommend it.<br /><br />However, I let my mom try it and she just loves it. She has a lot of hair, but it is baby fine. Her hair tends to be flat and doesn't have much body. She said that it makes her hair feel a lot more full and soft. So results seem to depend on your hair type. If you fine hair, I would recommend giving this product a try. However, if you thick hair, I would recommend skipping it.

review/text: This volumizing shampoo should probably be used with a conditioner from this CLEAR product line, but even without the separate conditioner, this is a nice product.  I'm not sure what a five star shampoo would consist of, so I'm giving it just four stars.  I think it's fair to say it's above average, for sure.

review/text: This shampoo promises to add volume to your strands and it is clinically proven to aid  in restoring your scalp's natural moisture balance. It has Nutrium 10 which is an advanced moisture complex of vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C & E, sunflower, almond, soybean & coconut oils & aloe vera.  The scent is pleasing and lingers even after your hair is dry.  It lathers easily and rinses cleanly. I didn't notice too much of a difference in my scalp but I did like the shine and bounce this formula gave me when I used it with the color protect conditioner.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised!
review/text: I was skeptical about trying this shampoo, because it seemed too inexpensive to be very good, but it was on a great sale so I decided to go for it.  I have long hair that is very fine (but a lot of it) and am very prone to flyaways. My hair also gets oily pretty fast. It also tends to get stringy and tangled throughout the day because it's so fine. I have to have a brush handy to keep it nice.<br /><br />After a few days of using this shampoo (in combination with the matching conditioner), I noticed a nice shine to my hair and the flyaways weren't as prevalent. I didn't notice a change in volume, but so far the changes were positive, so I kept using it.  Now I've been using it for about 3 weeks, and I can definitely say I love this shampoo.  The flyaways are almost completely gone, my hair is shiny and soft, and it definitely has more bounce and volume to it now than it did a few weeks ago. My hair also isn't ending up so stringy and tangled by the end of the day.  If these results continue through to the end of the bottle, I'll definitely be getting this again, especially since it's way cheaper than the shampoos I usually buy.  Plus it smells great!<br /><br />The reviews are varied on this shampoo, and hair type seems to be the biggest factor.  I'd say for really fine hair, it works well, but everyone's hair is different!  Personally, it worked wonders for me.

review/summary: Great Volume and Shine
review/text: It's hard to find a product that will make your hair look shiny and healthy and still have lots of volume.  Clear Scalp does just that.  I was very impressed with the luxuriously thick lather.  It almost feels like whipped cream once you start scrunching it around in your hair.  I love it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I don't especially love the smell.  I think they were going for something that would appeal to men or women so it's basically just a sort of bland, fresh smell which isn't bad but I'd like something more floral or citrusy.  At any rate, my hair, which is fairly short and color treated, washed thoroughly clean with only one lather.  I went on to use the corresponding conditioner and that review is posted with the conditioner.  Needless to say, I loved them both and will definitely buy these products in the future.  Everyone in my family has tried it and all have remarked on how shiny, soft and bouncy their has looks after just one use.

review/summary: CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce -- well worth its volume in gold!
review/text: CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo was the eureka discovery of the year for me, especially because I did not expect any difference in my hair from a shampoo that goes for about $5 a pop.  However, wow, once I tried Clear Volumizing shampoo, the product has taken the place of my other costly volumizing shampoos.<br /><br />This Leo's mane is the most important feature on my body, and I have never sacrificed great hair for cheap products. However, hairspray queen that I am, anything that says it will give a boost to my super-fine, limp hair finds its way home with me.<br /><br />From my initial encounter with Clear, I saw a difference.  My hair looked fuller.  Other costly products make my hair look fuller, but with a drier look.  This shampoo gave me sheen like a conditioner without the limp feel of a conditioning shampoo.  Additionally, my hair was so much easier to style than after shampooing with those costlier volumizing shampoos - a half a bottle of hairspray on my hair as opposed to a full bottle!  LOL!<br /><br />Seriously, I've been using Clear for over a week, and I can't get over the difference in my hair.  Oh, yes, the fragrance is nice and the appearance of the shampoo itself,  but to me--I don't care if it smells like manure pouring out of the bottle, I just want -not good--but great hair ... so I can give that lioness within full reign upon the day ahead ... this brand of Clear is something to roar about.<br /><br />Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist<br />Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE

review/summary: Works well
review/text: After the careful consideration of a team of players, the general consensus was that the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce works well for most types of hair. It is not particularly fragrant and that was cause for satisfaction from those that dislike strong smells emanating from a clean hair. The amount offered versus the pricing makes this product your average purchase. For someone who is plagued with thin hair this shampoo does, indeed, revitalize somewhat the hair and scalp, but the results are probably in prolonged use of the same product.<br />Overall, everyone appeared satisfied and still enjoys this shampoo on the daily routine of life. The container is solid and secure and no unwanted spills were reported when transportation was required. With these conclusions in mind this shampoo get a very decent 4 Stars rating from us.

review/summary: My New Favorite Shampoo
review/text: I received & reviewed the dandruff formula version of this shampoo prior to using this. I loved it and got great results; however, I was no fan of the overpowering scent. Happily, the fragrance in  this one is far less overwhelming, and the results as just as good if not better. I love this shampoo. It is my current favorite, and I intend to buy this well after my freebie runs out.<br /><br />Speaking as someone with fine, oily hair which must be washed everyday in the summer, this leaves my hair clean without feeling stripped. It also does a good job removing product build-up. It's truly better than many of the salon brands I have tried. Overall, a winner.

review/summary: Nothing Special
review/text: Full disclosure:  I didn't try this shampoo myself.  However, my wife (and, as you will see, my daughter) did try it.  The following are my wife's comments as transcribed by me.<br /><br />Having heard a lot about Clear's products (and as the frequent sufferer of "bad hair days"), I was looking forward to trying Clear's Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo.  Sadly, after two weeks of daily use, I can safely say that the product didn't meet my expectations.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the fragrant, but not overpowering, clean scent.  While the shampoo did look like thick milk, I wasn't bothered by its appearance.  Upon application, I found that the lather was abundant.  But, my first hint that the product's performance wouldn't match its presentation occurred when the shampoo's very nice scent dissipated quickly after I rinsed my hair.  The disappearing scent was matched by little, if any, volumizing, and no root boost, as evidenced by the number of fly-aways that I had after starting my use of the shampoo (equal to the number I had before using this shampoo).  I will say that my scalp didn't dry out from using the product.  But, there really wasn't any difference in my scalp's condition from before using Clear.<br /><br />I used the Clear shampoo both before and after I had a haircut, and the result was the same.  I will offer two caveats to my general observation.  First, I didn't use the Clear conditioner, or any other conditioner, with this shampoo.  It's possible that using the conditioner would have helped the shampoo's performance.  Second, while I have slightly wavy hair with medium body, my six-year-old daughter has very thick straight hair.  I tried the shampoo on her, and found her hair kept the fragrance and had a nice shine and bounce to it.  So, perhaps this shampoo works better on thicker hair.<br /><br />Overall, Clear's Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo wasn't anything special.  While I liked the scent and the lather, the results on my hair were negligible.  After all is said and done, I'll go back to my old shampoo once I'm done with this bottle of Clear.

review/text: Having turned the product over to the women-folk for their analysis, it received a positive review. I honestly don't know much about shampoo and usually just use the soap from the dispenser at the gym, so my level of expertise in this area is less than zero.<br />However, they like it for several reasons. First, it seems they like the over quality, fragrance, and all that stuff. Second, the design is great. The bottle can be stored with the tab at the bottom so that you don't have to shake the living daylights out of it when it gets half full.<br />It's nice to see a bottle of shampoo that hasn't been squeezed so hard it looks like it's been mangled by a bear.<br />Points for quality and design. I'll be picking more up soon.

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: I've got hair that on a bad day has the texture and attractiveness level of tiny feathers, completely uncontrollable and lacking in body and focus.  As a result, I've got a pile of shampoo and conditioner combos stacked on my tub shelf.  Most make my hair feel waxy.  Some dry it out even worse than I thought possible.  A couple do nothing for the body but smell really nice.  Naturally I had to try Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty volumizing root boost nourishing shampoo.  I did not have high hopes.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised (still am) that it works (in conjunction with the matching conditioner) so well that I like my hair again.  The shampoo feels silky in use and leaves my hair the same way but with a subtle added body boost.  Nice fragrance, rinses clean quickly, removes the tons of product I tend to lavish on my locks to cement them into place, and my hair looks really good all the time.  Woo-HOO!<br /><br />I've only been using this product for about a week, but I look forward to even better results as time goes by. Definitely worth a try.

review/summary: Very nice shampoo
review/text: I am always looking for volumizing shampoos. I have a few that I really like, but I find that my hair is more manageable when I switch between two shampoos and conditioners. I had never seen this product before and decided to try it. My hair loved it, and that means so do I.<br /><br />I like it because:<br />It has a nice scent to it - not that awful fake apple smell that so many shampoos have.<br />It definitely does not weigh my hair down.<br />My hair seemed to be a bit fuller after blow-drying than usual.<br /><br />I wish they made a version of this for color-treated hair. That would be perfect for me! In any case, I like this shampoo enough that I am going to try the corresponding conditioner in hopes that it will deliver the same results.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have tried the conditioner. It's quite honestly the only "volumizing" conditioner I have used that actually delivers on that promise.I have very fine, straight hair that doesn't have much fullness. As a result, I have tried just about every volumizing hair product out there. My hair is definitely fuller after using this conditioner, no matter what shampoo I use with it, and it maintains the fullness between shampoos. It's also soft and very easy to style. Without a doubt, this brand has become my new favorite.

review/summary: GREAT RESULTS AT A GREAT PRICE!
review/text: I have baby-fine hair, but tons of it.  I usually purchase salon shampoos which range from $15 - $20 per bottle.  I am always looking for a shampoo that will provide me with softness and manageability without the need for a daily conditioner since conditioner tends to weigh my hair down and make it appear flat.  When I first opened the bottle, I was pleased with the pleasant scent.  It is aromatic, but not overwhelming.  With the first use, my hair, which is currently dry from daily swimming, was softer than it had been with a much more expensive salon brand.  I was worried that the softness might lead to a flatter appearance.  To my surprise, my hair was manageable and styled very nicely with plenty of lift at the root.  I have now been using the shampoo daily for almost a week and am very pleased with the softness of my hair while still getting the volume I am looking for.  I have truly been getting better results than I had been getting from a salon brand costing over three times as much.  I recommend you try this product!

review/summary: Worked fine, won't replace my usual
review/text: The Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty etc. shampoo worked fine to clean my hair, (medium length, very fine, very naturally curly), and it left my hair soft and as manageable as curly hair can be in a humid summer climate.  However, I noticed my hair and scalp felt slightly grungier than usual the day after shampooing.  This made me suspect it may not rinse out as cleanly as my usual brand (Pantene Fine Hair Solutions Volume Shampoo). The shampoo is very strongly scented,  somewhere between fruity and floral.  I didn't care for the fragrance, but I didn't notice it once my hair was dry.  Presumably it is being packed differently when shipped to retailers, as I, too, had shampoo all over the package when I opened it.

review/text: I'm always in the market for new product that will add volume without weight to my not-so-fine fine hair.  After reading multiple reviews on this shampoo, I was a little worried that I was in for yet another disappointing, weighted-down hair experience.  What a pleasure then to note on first use that it not only supplied more body but was helpful in controlling those unfortunate waves that develop with age.<br /><br />I think this shampoo builds up over time; I get good results with occasional use, but regular use makes for a sorry, drowned-rat effect. Interesting though, while humidity (of which we have little here in Denver) is my hair's worst enemy, rain on a Clear Scalp shampoo day did not raise that dreaded halo of frizz.

review/summary: 'Clean' shampoo has a pungent perfume scent, works OK as a shampoo
review/text: Like most women, I'm always on the lookout for that next really great beauty product, whether it be a cosmetic, a perfume, or a hair product. One of the basics for me is having healthy, pretty hair. When I saw CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, I was intrigued. The name implies something very basic and healthy without too many chemicals.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was disappointed to find that it had not been packaged well. Where the conditioner (which was sent in a separate package) had the dispenser taped down and the entire bottle wrapped in plastic, the shampoo was merely wrapped in plastic. Without the tape holding the dispenser closed, the shampoo leaked all in the plastic during shipping. On a good note, the plastic wrapping proved good enough to contain the leakage so that it didn't even touch the cardboard box.<br /><br />When I removed the plastic, I was immediately stunned at the pungent perfume smell of the leaked shampoo. I had expected something light and `clear' and not this heavy perfume stench. Once I finished washing the bottle off, the scent stayed on my hands for hours afterwards, lasting through several thorough hand washings. For someone like me who prefers most products to be unscented, this was a huge turnoff.<br /><br />Although the shampoo has a heavy perfume scent, it isn't quite as bad when used in the hair as it had been when it was leaked out of the bottle. It is still a stronger scent than I like, but not as bad as I feared.<br /><br />The shampoo washes fine but I have to say that it doesn't do any better than the Pantene Shampoo that I have used for some time. It also doesn't seem to make any difference in my hair's volume than my Pantene offers.<br /><br />Once this bottle is finished, I will return to Pantene. I prefer it's lighter, fresh scent and am very satisfied with how it cleans my hair.

review/summary: Just another shampoo
review/text: Was excited to try this shampoo due to the volumizing claims. I have very thick, heavy hair that just hangs there, so am always on the lookout for something to pump up the volume! Maybe it would work on someone with finer hair, but it did not give me the hoped-for results.<br /><br />It arrived in an envelope, with the bottle wrapped in plastic. Sending shampoo in an envelope seemed like a strange choice, as mine had leaked enough that I needed to wash the bottle off. The shampoo has a pleasant scent, and comes out of the bottle thick and creamy. Lathered up nicely and was easy to rinse out. It cleaned my hair, but did nothing more after several weeks of usage, so don't think I would buy it.

review/summary: Really Helpful!
review/text: This product has improved several issues for me. For one, I have sensitive skin & so my scalp becomes irritated rather easily. Within 2 days of using this shampoo (& just the shampoo at the time, so imagine how much better the results when using the conditioner as well), I noticed a reduction in the number AND size of scalp bumps I had. Also, in recent years I have had major issues with tangles. Well, this shampoo left my hair so soft after just the first use even, I don't at all have to worry about struggling to comb my hair through when I use it. And now I see they have multiple products I can use, specifically formulated for my color-treated hair as well--excellent!

review/summary: Super Drying, Strong Smell, Poor Cap Design
review/text: I have fine, medium length hair and normally use a very mild shampoo that cleans well without drying my hair out, followed by a good Rinse-Out conditioner. My favorite shampoos are Paul Mitchell's Shampoo One and Pantene Pro-V for Fine Hair Volume Shampoo. They wash really clean and leave my hair nice and bouncy. I couldn't wait to try this New CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy Volumizing Root Boost Shampoo. What everyone wants, who has fine hair, is body at the roots. They list a lot of vitamins in this shampoo for your scalp that sound great too.<br /><br />When this New CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy Volumizing Root Boost Shampoo arrived it was sealed in a plastic bag inside of a bubble wrap envelope. The bag was soaked through in both the bubble envelope and the inner plastic sealed bag. When I opened it up to see what was the problem- the cap is so poorly designed that it leaks at the seal. The flip top was not opened, it literally leaks at the seal, where the bottle connects to the cap. I can't even begin to tell you about the strong smell of this shampoo. It is overwhelming and so perfumey, it's really hard to take. I ignored this poorly designed bottle and the strong perfume smell and went on to try the product, as sometimes shampoo smells are milder when you rinse them out of your hair.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that the shampoo is a really thick pink cream- not like my see through completely clear Shampoo One or completely clear see through Pantene for Fine hair. This should have been a dead give away that this shampoo is not good for fine hair, as my hairdresser said if you can't see through the shampoo- it's NOT for Fine hair. I tried the shampoo and it hardly foams up, but lays on your hair, coating it really thick. It doesn't rinse out well, leaving my hair greasy, yet my hair dried frizzy and felt dried out at the scalp. This is without a doubt the strangest shampoo I've ever used- how can a cream leave your hair and scalp dry and frizzy? The smell was not as overwhelming when the shampoo was rinsed out- but still not a pleasant smell. I couldn't wait to wash my hair again with my Pantene and get this strange drying cream out of my hair. If you have Fine hair- I would not recommend this shampoo- it was one of the worst shampoos I've ever tried.

review/summary: Does the job, but not for everybody
review/text: Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty does what it claims - my hair felt fuller after washing - but because it has sulfates as a leading ingredient, it is not perhaps for color-treated hair. Color aside, it has a pleasant scent, lathers well, and washes out without leaving a greasy feel as some nourishing shampoos do. If color detriment was not involved, I would not hesitate to use it again.

review/summary: Good hair days
review/text: I waited until I'd used this shampoo for a couple of weeks before reviewing to make sure any difference I saw was actually due to the shampoo.  Well, it seems to be.  My hopelessly limp, dry and fine hair looks terrific.  I haven't used any conditioner either, just the shampoo.  I also have problems with dry itchy scalp and have noticed that's improved as well.  I generally have several different shampoos I switch between but would rather have only one or two brands in use.  I've only had one other brand please me enough to rebuy, otherwise I'm just trying to use up whichever kinds I have on hand.  I see a commercial and hope that kind will meet my needs, but they rarely impress me.<br /><br />The other type that I've found I like needs its companion conditioner as well and I'll continue to use it, but I really value being able to meet my hair needs in one shot (no conditioner) and will continue to use this brand regularly.  The only downside I see is that there are so many different formulas, all with long names, that remembering the one I want will be a challenge.  Guess I'll have to keep this in my Amazon cart to refer back to as needed :).  I looked through the various kinds offered and thought this formula seemed like the best for me.  It does indeed offer lift and body without drying my hair, leaves my hair manageable and feeling healthy and my scalp feels less dry.  My hair, which is thin, also appears thicker, which I'm grateful for. I definitely recommend this brand.

review/summary: shampoos well but didn't give me volume
review/text: The shampoo like the conditioner has an odd feel to it, it kind of feels like it coats my hair. Maybe that is the way companies are trying to achieve volume? It didn't create any volume for me it actually made my hair a little more flat. I have wavy hair and as long as the products do not leave a heavy coating on my hair it remains wavy and has some decent volume. Sorry to say this did not create any volume at all for me. I think it is actually more suited to someone wanting to make their hair more smooth and straight.

review/summary: Makes your hair fall out...
review/text: I had seen the commercials on TV and thought since I have naturally fine un-treated blonde hair I would give it a try.<br /><br />Within one month my hair was falling out. Not just a little, A LOT.  Hairbrush full, shower, or just falling out.<br /><br />Thought it might be Thryoid, hormones or something else.  Went to the doctor and had all blood work done.  Everything FINE!<br /><br />I read comments for all brands of CLEAR on Amazon, found A LOT of people were having the same issues....<br /><br />Quit using the shampoo and went BACK to Pantene.  Within 2 weeks, my hair was slowing down in falling out.  Within 3 weeks, much to none was falling out.<br /><br />Called the manufacturer and complained.  They said this was unusual...  I advised them to check customers comments on Amazon.<br /><br />They offered to send me coupons for free porducts...<br /><br />If you want to give this shampoo a try, good luck.  If your hair starts to fall out, remember this comment.  IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FALL OUT.

review/summary: Too heavy
review/text: I purchased this shampoo at a local big box retailer. I had high hopes for this product as a "normal" shampoo (aka NOT Head and Shoulders) that would also mitigate symptoms of dry scalp (though this is not the dandruff formula, it does contain zinc pyrithione, which is the active ingredient in dandruff shampoos).<br /><br />Overall, I have been disappointed in this product. Most egregiously, it makes my hair stringy and very flat--the opposite of the volumizing effects it claimed to offer. In addition, it only did a passable--not great--job at keeping my scalp moisturized. I suppose perhaps the specific anti-dandruff formula does better with that, but since this shampoo claims to promote hair AND scalp health, I expected better. Finally, as ofther reviewers have mentioned, the product can get gloppy; the bottle gets blocked up pretty frequently, even though I'm careful not to leave it open or spill any shampoo around the opening.<br /><br />I gave two stars because the shampoo does have a pleasant smell and a nice lather. Maybe it works better on other hair types, but this is not the stuff for me.

review/summary: Not "Clear" Enough
review/text: The selling point of this shampoo is that it doesn't contain parabens so, theoretically, the target market for these is the health-conscious.  As such, I think this falls rather short of the mark.<br /><br />The consistency of the shampoo is all right; it's a bit thin so it's easy to spill at first.  Once you get used to it, though, it's fine.  It lathers well, and it does the job.<br /><br />However, it has a horrendously strong perfumey chemical fragrance.  We find this fragrance truly awful (and overpowering), and it completely undermines any concept of "clear" or "pure" or "less unhealthy" in our minds.<br /><br />We'll take a pass on this one and stick with something less obviously scented.

(Full disclosure: I use this shampoo w/ the matching conditioner 99% of the time so I'm not sure if it's the shampoo or conditioner that helps with less tangling, but even before using the conditioner after shampooing my hair feels nice and smooth and soft and not knotty.)<br /><br />The shampoo smells fantastic and I like it better than Pantene and Herbal Essences and other more expensive salon brands that I've tried like Paul Mitchell.<br /><br />The bottle doesn't say that it's safe for colour-treated hair, however I have highlighted hair and have been using this product for several weeks with no ill effects on my coloured hair. Your mileage may vary of course.

review/text: This is an interesting new product.  The shampoo, used along with the conditioner, seems to actually increase fullness of my fine hair.  It will probably take using it regularly for a month or two (I didn't notice any claims about a period of time for it to work) before one can be sure.  It has a very light and pleasant fragrance.  Usually I prefer fragrance-free but this is not bad and I've not noticed any itching or burning I usually get from fragranced products.  It has a flat end to stand it upright in shower or bath (opening end is down to enable use of that final last drop.  It lathers nicely even with the hard water here.  Left my hair squeaky clean and is something I would buy again.  Thanks!

review/summary: I expected something, well, Clear
review/text: This is a decent shampoo. However, it is not clear; it is milky. It is heavily fragranced with that fruity floral beloved of pretty much all drugstore shampoos--why? It left my hair feeling coated and silky--like I'd used a combination shampoo+conditioner--which is a scary thing to a person with fine, thin, limp, hair, such as might be expected to choose a volumizing root boost shampoo. I cannot imagine who would use the matching conditioner.That said, my jaw-length hair is not weighed down and I didn't use or need to use any extra conditioning product either. It is overly fragrant with a girly teen kind of fragrance.<br /><br />Of course, it's stupid concept to begin with--the only way to "nourish" your hair or scalp is by eating good food. You can condition it, which is what this does well enough. I might buy it again if it just weren't so perfumed!! If I got a migraine, I'd need to wash my hair!

review/text: I've got fine, curly hair so I have to be careful not to use conditioner too often or it will be limp and the curls won't be bouncy.  I sometimes use shampoos with the conditioners already in them, because separate conditioners are too much.  I often use volumizing shampoo because it tends to strip oils out of my hair and keep it from  being weighed down.<br /><br />I liked this Clear Scalp & Hair volumizing root nourishing shampoo.  It lathers nicely and smells good, and rinses easily.  The bottle is easy to hold on to, and the price for 12 ounces in the bottle is good.  Like some of the other reviewers reported, my bottle arrived in a plastic bag.  The bottle had popped open in shipping and some of the shampoo had leaked out in the bag.<br /><br />This shampoo left my hair soft, shiny and obviously moisturized, but it did weigh my hair down and I had to wash it again the next day. I didn't notice any volumizing with this shampoo - in fact it had the opposite effect for me.<br /><br />I gave the bottle to my daughter to try, since she has dry hair and uses tons of conditioner with every shampoo.  She really liked the scalp nourishing aspect of this product, although she didn't notice any volumizing effects either.

review/text: When I was younger, I was prone to trying whatever new product came along, eschewing the various benefits that I was seeking. Seldom, if ever, was there a payoff. When I see an advertisement for a product promising "bigger," "better," or "stronger," I don't even consider it. Imagine my surprise when I tried this new shampoo and actually noticed more volume in my hair after blow-drying it! Even weirder, two people asked me if I'd had my hair cut the day I used it. Seriously. It's not a miraculous change--it's a shampoo, not a weave--but it definitely makes a noticeable difference. The only negative comment I have, is that it has a fairly strong perfume scent, which I tend to avoid in soaps and shampoos, but I will absolutely continue to use it.

review/text: First off, let me say that this shampoo smells fantastic and has great lather - two things that I value in a shampoo. Unfortunately, this shampoo has also left my hair a bit dry and without shine. I have color treated hair, and do not typically use a shampoo for color treated hair, since I find that the extra moisturizers in shampoos designed specifically for color treated hair tend to weigh my hair down. I typically purchase shampoos that are supposed to add volume, since I also have very thick hair that tends to get helmet-like if I don't use a volumizing shampoo. But apparently, this shampoo is not moisturizing enough for my hair type. So, if you have color treated hair that tends to get dry, I would suggest another shampoo or another brand.

review/text: This is a rally great shampoo! I have spent a small fortune over the years on shampoo's that promise greater volume and, sadly, have found very few that deliver. This, I'm happy to say, is one of the few. First off the shampoo itself has a nice thick texture to it and a very mild, not overpowering, pleasant sent. The end result is good volume and a visibly shiny, silky appearance to the hair. This shampoo is now in my shampoo rotation which up to this point included Johnathan Product and John Frieda Luxurious Volume (two other shampoo's I highly recommend to those with thin hair). I think it's a good idea to switch up shampoo's periodically. Will definitely be using this shampoo for a long time!

review/text: The main problem with the product is that it leaked in transit.  Luckily it's packaged very well so the package didn't arrive dripping but it was a bit of a mess to clean.  Also I received the shampoo courtesy of Amazon Vine but if I had actually paid for the product and lost a portion in transit I'd be very unhappy.  Overall I feel like the shampoo leaves my fine hair almost too soft so it's not holding it's style terribly well.  It has some gorgeous shine though and the colors in my hair seem very bright.  I'm not sure I'd spend the money on it in the future however.<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD:  Since I switched to this shampoo I've gotten a number of compliments on my hair and a bunch of people have asked if I got my hair cut (which I haven't).  If this continues then I'd certainly consider buying this again in the future.

review/summary: Fantastic surprise
review/text: I have bi-racial hair and highly processed colour treatment, so I'm beyond fussy with what I'll use on it to keep it clean. For over 10 years I've been using exclusively Redken's All Soft, at $20 bucks a bottle. It's never failed me and is certainly worth the price.<br /><br />When I've been at hotels or friend's homes, I've tried various products but in one washing, my ultra-tech hair style came out looking like a Witch's Broom...dry, brittle and awful...all in 1 washing! So, it was only because this was FREE, did I try it.<br /><br />I'm glad that I did! My hair is short (2") and layered and I did receive not only volume but also the 3-colour treatment did NOT lighten. And, it was as smooth and silky as the Redken product! A strange added bonus is that the white gold diamond pendant that I wear 24/7 actually sparkled MORE, after being simultaneously washed in the suds. LOL<br /><br />Now, I alternate between the pricy Redken and this brand, feeling happy and smug with saving the extra money.<br /><br />Side Note: When this product was shipped to me, it was double wrapped in shrink-wrap plastic but I could still smell the shampoo when I opened the envelope it was shipped to me in. After using a paring knife to cut/peel/slice away the double shrink wrap, I inherited one fat mess of shampoo oozing out from under the cap! No matter HOW MANY TIMES I'VE WASHED THE CAP, shampoo continues to leak out of it. So, if you can't find this product in a store, keep a head's up that THIS might happen to you, too. Doesn't detract from the quality of the product, however.

So, I was excited to try the "Volumizing Root Boost."<br /><br />I will say that I did see an increase in volume. But, my hair is very fine and I just got it cut pretty short. So, if I didn't see an increase in volume to some extent with this shampoo, I'd call it a flop. The problem I have is that my hair is now more fly-away and less sleek and shiny than it was with "Strong Lengths."<br /><br />Here are my primary observations:<br />1. My hair has appeared much healthier (and I have received comments from others to that effect) since I switched to Clear shampoos. That includes both product sets that I have tried.<br />2. I would love to have tried the volume boost shampoo and conditioner set before I got my hair cut, but with short hair I'm not sure this would be my first choice. As much as I hate to use other products for volume, I think that might be the better solution for me.<br />3. I have not tried using this shampoo with one of the other conditioner options, although I did try the volume boost conditioner with the strengthening shampoo. I don't know that I saw much of a difference mixing those two.<br /><br />So, bottom line - I still really like the Clear brand, and I don't dislike this particular product from the brand. I'm happy to have it and use it, but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way, with my hair cut and type, to purchase this product over other Clear products.

review/summary: Shampoo
review/text: This shampoo is supposed to volumize and nourish the hair. I'll have to use it more. It smells good, suds are very thick and rinses clean. Doesn't make my hair dry. The one problem I had was the way they shipped it. It leaked in the envelope and the plastic bag they had it in. Wasted half of the bottle.

review/summary: Works as Shampoo, Not Sold on Volumizing roots
review/text: What can I say? It's shampoo, it lathers up, smells pretty nice, cleans your hair and it burns when it gets in your eyes. As far as lifting my roots to make me look like a hair model, well, keep looking. After using it a few times, I noticed my root volume was about the same as when I use cheaper shampoo. I can say a little goes a long way. It only took a small amount (about a nickle size worth) to give good lather. And the shampoo has kind of a pearly, opaque look to it. Not that it makes any difference, but it did give me a moment of, "oooh,pretty."

review/summary: Not bad, but not for colored hair
review/text: The shampoo arrived wrapped in plastic wrapping inside a padded envelope. I didn't have any leakage, but I did pick up a strong scent inside the package, but fortunately it isn't that strong when using the product (strong scents and I do not get along well). The shampoo has a very thick consistency and you don't need much to work up a lather. I've used it about four times now, and while I'm seeing a bit more *bounce* to my very fine hair, I suspect I'd have to use it for a longer period of time to see if there's any improvement to encouraging any growth at the scalp. And therein lies the rub - I don't think this is color safe. I'm at the end of my color cycle and due for a retouch any day now, so a bit more fading wasn't a huge issue, but if I'd just had it done and got that much fading I'd be a seriously unhappy camper. Not great, but not bad either IMHO.

review/summary: Might be good for others but NOT ME!
review/text: The first problem I had with this shampoo, was expecting to see something CLEAR poured into my hand, given the name of it. When it came out a pinkish opaque I should have known that was only the beginning. But I proceeded to use it anyway and was sorely disappointed to the point of all out frustration, perhaps anger. I have very long hair, almost to my waist, and it's always been fine/limp, so seeing that this shampoo says VOLUMIZING, I expected it to do that. Instead it went on like conditioner without having used shampoo, and ultimately it felt like I gave my hair an oil bath. I actually had so much oily residue (or whatever that was!) as a result of using this, that I had to wash my hair again with GOOD shampoo (Pantene), to get that stuff off my hair. But in the meantime, while assessing the consequences of using "CLEAR", I found my hair to have zero body or fullness, and it was nearly impossible to get dry, or maybe it did get dry and felt so oily I couldn't tell. Either way, I absolutely hated it. I have been wondering what they were thinking, making a product like this. And as for it being opaque instead of clear, I find that odd, because every other volumizing shampoo I use (Pantene, Dove, Suave, etc) comes out clear and yet does not use that as their claim to fame.<br />Regardless of that, I very generously gave this 2 stars because I am assuming my hair type must be at least partly to blame for my bad experience. I would hope this shampoo is useful for someone that has excessively dry or "wiry" hair who needs the deepest conditioning to tame it or soften it.

But this was an offer to good to pass up -- a free Amazon Vine trial.<br /><br />It exceeded my expectations. Based on the reviews of others, I used a very tiny amount and it was more than adequate.<br /><br />The entire family now uses it and loves it. My wife does the shopping; it will be interesting to see if she searches for this product the next time she goes shopping. I have no idea how it compares in price to Head and Shoulders, but it does not matter. It's great.

review/text: I have oily scalp and shampoos either end up leaving too much moisturizer in or too drying and gives me dull, fly away hair. I had no issues with this one. It's a cream like liquid that doesn't leave any oily after effects. Hair feels clean but not dry. I've only been using it for less than 2 weeks, but so far it's clean and clear sailing.

review/summary: Creamy shampoo that really is different
review/text: We've always bought the cheapest shampoos in the store, judging that they were all pretty much the same.  Well, in this case at least, there is a difference.<br /><br />Both my wife and I tested this shampoo as well as its sister product, Total Care Nourishing Shampoo.  We saw very little difference between these two products, but they both stand well above the typical shampoo.  Coming out of the bottle they are both thick and creamy, and very little is needed to get a good lather going.  When it comes time to rinse out, they wash off easily, leaving no residue.  I was suspicious at first because my hair did not feel "squeaky clean" after rinsing, but once my hair was dry I could see that it was both clean and soft, not oily, and stayed that way all day, even wearing a hat.  Both shampoos also give some weight to the hair which, with my thinning hair, I really appreciate.  My wife also reported that with this shampoo, she felt no need to use conditioner.  The reader will see essentially the same review on both of the Clear Scalp products we tested, the only difference between them being that this one (Volumizing Root Boost) probably leaves the hair with a little more weight.  But we expect to give up our practice of buying the cheapest shampoos and will purchase one of these in the future.

review/text: I received this shampoo weeks ago and have been using it ever since.  It suds up nicely and really cleans my hair.  For curly-haired people, this is a great, light shampoo that doesn't feel heavy on your hair.  The volume-boosting has worked well, and my hair is not frizzy at all after using this product.  Also, it has a light floral smell.  You'd be surprised at how many volumizing shampoos have a strong, chemically odor.  This was aces all around.  Great, great product!

review/summary: Just so so.....shipping issue as well
review/text: My shampoo was shipped in a bubble envelope and when I opened it the inside was a wet, goopy mess. The shampoo bottle was place in a plastic bag first, and then into the bubble envelope, but there was a slit in the plastic bottle and I list about 1/4 of the product as a result.<br /><br />Once I rinsed the bottle, I put it in the shower to try the following morning.  The shower seat was a goopy mess as well. Apparently there was a second leak from the bottom somewhere.<br /><br />I decided to try the shampoo anyway.  I have very fine hair, but quite a bit of it. My hair tends to look good when I wash it and dry it, but then go flat within an hour.  I was unsure about how this would work as it felt more like a cream rinse when I applied it than a shampoo.  I found it a bit hard to rinse out, and although my hair looked fine when I blew it dry, I did not have any extra volume like I was hoping -- based on the advertising.<br /><br />It wasn't awful in any way, but it isn't one I would buy again.  Plan to stick with eith my Paul Mitchell or Redkin favorites for now.

review/text: I have lupus, and every time I get a flare, I lose a ton of hair.  I also have severe reactions to some hair products that can cause even more hair loss.  A volumizing shampoo that doesn't cause bad reactions is like gold to me.  This shampoo works very well and did not cause my hair to fall out or my scalp to bleed.  The only downside to using it is the smell.  It smells a little cloying, like lotions and shampoos from the early 80s.  Whatever it is, my skin didn't react to it, so all's well that ends well.

review/summary: Serviceable shampoo perhaps better suited for buying in person
review/text: I have been using this shampoo for a week now. I have been using it alone, without the additional conditioner. My hair is long, straight and very fine. I use volumizing shampoos as a matter of routine. I usually move between <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ISB3AG">Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Volume Shampoo</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139353Q">Paul Mitchell Thickening Shampoo, Lemon Sage</a>. Both of these work great for me, although they have different issues. Pantene is instant volume, but coats your hair. Lemon Sage, if used with the conditioner, works well but costs a good bit more. It also creates build-up, but not nearly as quickly.<br /><br />I found this shampoo pretty much on par with those (left my hair soft, full and pleasantly but not strongly scented), with one exception - my hair looks pretty good immediately after I wash it, but not so good the day after, and since I typically wash my hair in the evening this means I don't get the benefit when I want it most. Both Pantene and Lemon Sage seem to last from shampoo to shampoo.<br /><br />Like Pantene, this product does build-up. The effect of this is to actually weigh down your hair and make it look flat and greasy. This can be counteracted by periodically using a good clarifying shampoo - weekly or every other week. I'm in-between at the moment, as the one I've used for some time has gone off the market. I wound up picking up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027C9CS">Suave For Men, Deep Clean Peppermint</a> even though I'm not a man, because it was the only one the store I was in seemed to carry, and I was out. But I'm in the market for something better. This one strips away the build-up, but it's very harsh; it actually burns my scalp.<br /><br />I experienced the same problem many others have reported: while it was only a small amount, my bottle leaked in shipment. I doubt I lost much product, but who would want to lose any? If I ever decide to pick this up again (and I may not, given the next day issue), I'll probably look for it in a store.<br /><br />I'll note that the product may perform better with the matching conditioner, but it might also lead to quicker product build-up.

review/summary: Mixed Feelings... Poor Packaging.. Hair Decent?
review/text: First, like others have mentioned, mine arrived in a plastic wrap in a package with its lid open and shampoo all over the interior of the plastic wrap. Not only was it a mess to open.. but 1/3 the bottle was already gone. Next came trying the product.. so far 1 weeks time and I will update again after a month goes by. When I first put some on my hair and begain to lather I stopped and made sure I used the right bottle.... its like a cream, and doesn't feel like a shampoo normally would feel. I thought I grabbed the wrong bottle! I'm mixed on how the product feels, and thougth it would leave my hair hanging heavy from the feel of the product but it did not I have let my hair air dry and have blow dried it as well. Even with air drying I did feel some volumn to my hair. My hair is normally flat and I have used various products for volumne. However this product did not do any better then other products like Pantene, Herbel Essence, Paul Mitchel, and others. I tend to use various products and never the same shampoo when I run out. Its almost as if my hair gets use to a product and it no longer works well, so I mix it up.<br /><br />I do like the smell to the product and don't find it overwhelming as others suggested. I did not find it dulled my hair (I do have highlights)My hair did feel clean, not oily or dirty looking as others have experienced. Think this is a try it out and see kind of product. Everyones hair is so different so each review is based on the persons kind of hair really. My hair is normally not oily, but is flat and below shoulder length with highlights. I saw no major changes compared to other products so for that reason its OK. I do not like the cap to the bottle and again how its packaged. Nothing like getting a product and loosing 1/3 of it and having a huge mess..... perhaps if you want to try it try it at a local store.

review/summary: Really does add a little volume
review/text: I have super straight, baby-fine hair that has been my despair all my life.  Mess with it much, trying to give it volume, and you'll give it distress, which it shows by becoming yet more fine and breaking off.  So I was very interested to see if this shampoo could help.  And it really did give my hair a little extra bounce.  Not a huge amount, but there was a discernable difference.  It has a nice fragrance, too, and my hair feels really clean without any residue on it.  My only gripe is the bottle.  It's smaller at the bottom than it is at the top, and shaped oddly, too.  That's fine when it's in the little pocket holder in my shower, but when I get it out to use it, it's very easy for it to get unbalanced and fall over.  But, it's not that big a deal, overall.  I plan to try the conditioner, too.

review/summary: Smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft and full bodied
review/text: This shampoo is as wonderful as the conditioner.  It has a very fragrant and fresh smell.  I used this along with their conditioner and let my hair air dry. Besides the great fragance that remained, this shampoo (along with their complementary conditioner) left my hair full-bodied and soft.  I love this product and really like the sleek light lilac bottle it comes in (especially since my bathroom is light purple).<br /><br />From now on this will be one of my shampoos. I already ordered two extra bottles from Amazon besides the free one I got for review.<br /><br />POSTSCRIPT - The only complaint I have is that the bottle should be designed so that the product label can be read while it rests on its spout like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UM">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>.  Basically I store the bottle flat end down so that the shampoo is always at the bottom (near the spout) and can be dispensed easily.  However, when you store it this way (which is the way the conditioner bottle was designed to be stored), the writing is upside down unlike the conditioner bottle which has the product label showing correctly.  This is a minor issue, however.

review/summary: I can see myself using this shampoo conistently
review/text: I have very dry skin, including my scalp. I don't have a dandruff issue, just a dry scalp no matter what shampoos I've tried. This shampoo has stopped my head-scratching.<br /><br />Clear Scalp shampoo has a creamy feel to it. It's heavier than most shampoos I've tried, but lathered just as well. I felt like I was using a cream instead of a shampoo. it rinsed out well, leaving my hair less tangled than my usual shampoo does. Once dry, my hair feels silkier, smoother, and my scalp is really not itchy anymore - no more scratching my head. Using this shampoo feels like I've used a moisturizer on my scalp and hair - but it doesn't leave an greasy feel behind. As for the volumizing part - I can't vouch for it giving your hair more body - I already have big hair that I'm forever trying to control. It didn't flatten my hair out, which, if you want volume, is a real plus.<br /><br />I don't now how they did it, but I'm a real fan of this product and fully intend to keep on using it.

review/summary: Volumizes, but might fade color?
review/text: First, a note about packaging for this shampoo.  It arrived in a padded mailing envelope, and inside that, the shampoo bottle was tightly taped inside a plastic bag. Good thing, because the inside of the plastic bag contained about a third of the shampoo, which had leaked from the bottle!  So, a different way of shipping this product is a must.<br /><br />Next, some more specific information about the shampoo itself:<br /><br />1)  The scent is very strong. (Best described as a fruity/floral.) I could smell it even before opening the mailer, and I thought that was because of the leakage, but the scent remained strong even after cleaning up the spill. If you don't like strongly scented products, this may bother you.<br /><br />2)  Bottle design is okay (product comes out a small hole in a flip-up cap), just not appropriate for the shipping method they use, as already mentioned.<br /><br />3) Product amount is 12.9 oz, and since you need about a half-dollar size amount, it should last awhile.<br /><br />4) Cleansing properties: It does not lather "richly", or offer a head full of bubbles, but rather has a creamy, low-sudsing consistency.  (Which is why I used that half-dollar size amount.) My scalp and hair did feel cleansed after use, even minus the big bubbles.<br /><br />5) Conditioning: I can't say whether my scalp was "nourished", but my hair DID have BIG volume after blow drying, and also felt smooth and healthy.<br /><br />However, the down-side for me, and the reason for only four-stars, is that, after two uses, I noticed some color-fading. Eeek! (My hair is colored once every 4-5 weeks, and I was only on week 2 of color when trying this shampoo. Usually, I use L'Oreal EverPure color care system shampoo.) Now, the color fading may be because I'm "of a certain age", and my hair doesn't hold color as long/well as it used to. Or maybe the change from my usual brand just looked "different" to me.<br /><br />In any case , I felt this product delivered on its promise to volumize and help with healthiness, but the color-fade was a concern for me. If necessary, I'll return again to add comments if the color fade becomes more noticeable.

review/text: My husband and I both tried this product. We have different types of hair. We are in our late fifties, early 60's in age.  My husband's hair has never been dyed.

When we have the money, I search for the finest products to try to fix my hair. Nothing works.<br />Wonder of wonders, this shampoo did the trick for both our hair types.  My husband doesn't need to use a conditioner of any sort when he uses this shampoo, and his hair comes out looking like he is a fifteen year old.<br />I use it, and totally LOVE how my hair feels.<br /><br />NOW let my editor try and joke that I look in photos like one of those cartoons where you have stuck your finger in a light socket and your hair is flying all over the place and frizzing up!<br /><br />This shampoo is a great buy, and for the first time in years I feel as if I have tons and tons of hair, due to the volumizing effect. It is great!  We recommend it!  Appropriate for two types of hair at least!

review/summary: Did Get Some Volumizing + Curls Seemed to Last Longer
review/text: I have fine hair so even though I have lots of hair, I do like to find products that increase the volume.<br /><br />I used this product for about a week and it did seem to make my hair look thicker. I just HATE hairspray plus I think I used my fair share back in the '80s so I never use the stuff now and after using this shampoo and curling my hair with hot rollers or my curling iron, it did seem like my curls lasted longer than when I use my normal daily shampoo which is not volumizing.<br /><br />I thought the scent of this shampoo was fine - not overpowering at all and it dissipated quite a bit after blowdrying and styling so that by the time my hair was fixed, I hardly noticed it. I also like the texture of the shampoo. It's really creamy and thick, almost like a cream rinse.<br /><br />The only downside to this shampoo was that for me, it's an absolute necessity to use either cream rinse or a leave in conditioner/detangler with it because after shampooing, I could hardly get a brush/comb through my hair without adding back some "moisture". However, the times I didn't use a conditioner or detangler, though it took a long time to comb out all the tangles, it didn't seem like my hair was fly away or damaged looking after it air dried but it did seem that it had more static in it without the detangler when I blew it dry.<br /><br />Overall I would give this shampoo 3.75 stars for the volumizing and the fact that my curls seemed more bouncy and lasted longer than when I use my every day shampoo.<br /><br />I also tried this brand in the "Damage & Color Repair" version and I think I prefer it over this one but I'll keep this one to use when I want to use my hot rollers.

review/summary: Great for short fine hair!
review/text: I have short very fine hair.  I was hoping that after chemo it would come back with a better texture, but I think it is even finer than before and even a little thin.  This shampoo did great!  After using it and drying my hair it actually had some body. It wasn't just lying flat to my head.  I have used it several times with the same results.  I like it a lot.  I don't know how it would work for other hair types, but for short fine hair like mine it is good & I will continue to purchase it.  Instead of using gels etc. to give my hair body I use the shampoo, blow dry & then use Aveda Light Elements shaping wax.  They work great together! I am so happy that The Vine Program had this as a choice and that I chose it to review.

review/summary: Does a Good Job
review/text: I received Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo and the conditioner from Amazon Vine two weeks ago and have been using it ever since.  It does a good job shampooing.  It suds up nicely and my hair very clean.  Using the conditioner and the shampoo has not made any difference in the volume of my hair.  That might be because I have thin fine long hair.  Just the weight of my hair could be keeping the volumizing from being effective.  My one big complaint is the size of the print on the container.  The smallest print is the word shampoo.  I wear glasses for reading and do not wear them in the shower (does anyone).  The print was so small that I could not tell which was conditioner and which was shampoo. I solved that by using a black marker to put a large S on the Shampoo and a large C on the conditioner.  It would have been nice if both words were in large print on the bottle.<br /><br />After I wrote this I had my hair cut much shorter.  I can tell a difference now.  It does give my hair body and volume now that it is shorter.

review/summary: Very nice...with an issue or two
review/text: Obviously, if you read the other reviews here, there are a couple of problems with this shampoo's container. Like other people here, my bottle came open in transit and leaked. Not as badly as some, but still that is not acceptable for a product you will sell online. Also, the odd bottle shape is a bit top heavy and likely to fall over..and no doubt leak more.<br /><br />But that aside, it is a very nice product. For me, the scent was quite mild and nice. The pinkish color is fine for me but maybe not what a man might like. It is thick, but I like that. I always put my shampoo in my hand, add a little water and later it up before I rub it into my hair. I always have and that worked just fine. Does it increase volume? I am not sure, but it let my hair very soft and nice and easy to style.

review/text: I have thin, fine, baby-soft hair and have tried 100's of products to get volume.  It was when I tried Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Volumizing shampoo that I finally found a product that worked well with my hair type.  Note:  the bottle does not state that it is for fine or thin hair, but it did work on mine.  I recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants more volume in their hair.

review/summary: Seems very good though not cheap
review/text: Well, I can't say anything negative about this shampoo except that it is more expensive than a lot of good shampoos. That said, it smells nice and my hair seems OK after using it and feels good when I run my hand through it. About its claim of volumizing the hair, it does seem to do that. So, overall I am satisfied with this product, but for me, cheap shampoo works fine and will remain my first choice. But, for those seeking what this shampoo claims, I do recommend it for those who are interested to at least try it.

review/summary: Great Results
review/text: I have been using Clear Volumizing Shampoo for a week.  I love the way it makes my hair look.  I have fine/thin hair but the results have been great so far.  I have only used it on my scalp/roots as I am careful not too shampoo the rest of my long hair much because (any) shampoo makes my hair too flat.  The smell is pleasing, the volume is comparable if not better than other shampoos.  I can not yet comment on the strength or health of my hair but will check back in several weeks to do so.  The shipping left much to be desired, the shampoo had some leakage - perhaps not the best bottle design.

review/summary: Clear and Clean
review/text: I had never heard about this shampoo before I was asked to try it and write a review. I am very fussy about my shampoo as I have fine straight hair that loves to do it's own thing no matter what you do. I color my hair which makes it equally important to have a shampoo that works well. I have tried so many brands in my lifetime of over 60 years looking for the right shampoo for my hair but always was disappointed and had to settle for what ever worked for awhile. UNTIL Clear came along. I was a bit sceptical about trying a new shampoo again but thought why not? So I did and I was really surprised that it actually did what it said it would do. It does give you volume. It does leave your hair feeling clean with no build up which seems to be a big problem with most shampoos. I have a skin alergy and this shampoo did not give me a problem at all. The big thhing is no build up of unrinsed shampoo left over. I leave the shower feeling like my hair and my scalp are squeeky clean and it stays clean for more than a day. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants or needs volume for their hair. It gave my hair a lift the first time around with my blow dryer and I did not have to go to the salon to get a salon look. Since I visit a salon every month for a cut, shape, and color that means something to me. BUY IT -- or at least try it once. I believe you will be pleasantly satisfied just like me.

review/summary: Not for fine hair
review/text: I can't  imagine what hair needs volumizing if not fine straight hair, but this shampoo really doesn't work well for that kind of hair.  It feels rather luxurious - creamy & smooth - and it has a nice, light scent, but it's really too heavy for thin strands.  My hair is shiny, but limp (even limper than usual), and it has to be washed every day with this shampoo, rather than every other day, which is my normal habit. If you want an excellent, affordable shampoo for fine hair, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KYCUTE">Suave Professionals Volumizing Shampoo by Suave, 12.6 oz</a> works great.

review/summary: Thickens hair as advertised
review/text: My wife and I both use this shampoo and like it. It has a nice scent and you don't need a lot of the product to get a nice, rich lather. It rinses out well. We both have very thin hair, and I feel this product does, indeed, make our hair look thicker. My hair also generally gets oily pretty quickly, and this shampoo seems to prevent that. I also think this is a good value for the price. It sure beats spending double-digits for salon products that give the same result. I recommend that you give it a try.

This stuff had a nice creamy texture, and I took a little extra time to gently work it in. It felt good and rinsed clean. My hair felt nice after I used it, and it has a nice if somewhat flowery scent. Good price for a good product.

review/summary: Has been working well in conjunction with the volumizing conditioner
review/text: I decided to try this product after trying the coordinating the conditioner, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UM">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner</a>, and finding that it worked well for me.  I have fine, thin, straight hair that tends to fall flat pretty easily, so any hair product which can product extra volume is greatly appreciated!<br /><br />This shampoo has a subtle yet pleasant, fresh scent.  It lathered well and rinsed from my hair cleanly.  I wouldn't say that it produced huge amounts of volume, but for my fine hair, simply having the shampoo leave my hair feeling clean yet not weighed down is a huge plus.  In addition, it does seem to leave my hair feeling somewhat thicker and more substantial.  Finally, I have been having itchy scalp problems (without dandruff) for months now and have tried various shampoos to try to address the issue.  Since I have been using the CLEAR, I have not noticed any itchiness or dryness at all--another huge plus for me.<br /><br />So far, the CLEAR Volumizing Root Boost Shampoo and Conditioner are working well together for me.  The only (small) complaint that I have about both the Shampoo and Conditioner is the design of the bottles--they sort of flare out, which make them difficult to push neatly together on a bath shelf and which give them the appearance that they are leaning over.  (I do like how the Conditioner opens at the bottom--but why not make the Shampoo open that way too?)<br /><br />Overall, however, I am definitely pleased with this product, and I plan to continue buying it as long as it keeps working for me.

review/summary: THE WINNER FOR THE NOT YET READY FOR MARKETING IS . . .
review/text: I have long, fine hair, shoulder-length+.<br />If dry it can break when combed/brushed.<br /><br />Before CLEAR, I used shampoos/conditioners by Paul Mitchell [[ASIN:B002N5MI8C Paul Mitchell Extra Body Daily Shampoo, 33.8-Ounce Bottle] and Pantene [[ASIN:B001F51V3E Pantene Pro-V 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Classic Care, Packaging May Vary, 25.4 -Ounce (Pack of 2)]. They give my hair shine and satisfactory body. And less breaking. I'd hoped to have it look even better, be tougher with CLEAR. So I took a shot.<br /><br />CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy/Nourishing Shampoo with its sales pitch of 'nourishing<br />the scalp' seemed believable, like stimulating/nourishing the scalp. Oops; not-so.<br /><br />Terse instructions say "when using shampoo and conditioner" "apply to wet hair, gently massage into scalp, lather and rinse." (Two statements, connected by an asterisk) Seemed<br />unclear.<br /><br />Before rinsing, CLEAR's goopy consistency made me doubt its sticky white lather could get past the hair (not really a lather; no frothy bubbles). The consistency is like a women's facial creme. I took pictures of my frothy Gorgon-Head scary-odd hair. Pretty funny, kinda scary.<br /><br />I tried finger tips to rub the glop into my scalp. Maybe some got through my hair, but its heavy-consistency turned hair follicles into slimy protrusions like bright white heavy meringue; sticky and thick like tooth paste; both funny and weird. I tried rubbing it into my scalp; it just glopped together in my hair. Afterwards I had to wash my hands twice. The white stuff that couldn't get past hair covered my fingers, palms.<br /><br />My hair doesn't have observably more volume; after drying, the hair seemed sort of frizzed; literally less shiny, healthy. I repeated the treatment a week later, just<br />to be sure. Same effects, problems. And there's more:<br /><br />The label said an ingredients list was on the label's back.'Just peel it<br />off'. And it was, evidently rushed to market, upside down and backwards.<br /><br />Last shot at CLEAR: The plastic bottle has an flat oval top. The container came in a fitted, sealed plastic sleeve inside a padded Amazon mailer. Shipping shakes evidently poked the flat top and inside the sleeve was slopped with the gooey white glop.<br /><br />Back to the lab, CLEAR Marketeers. I'll stick with Paul Mitchell and Pantene.

review/summary: My favorite one so far
review/text: Over the last 2 or 3 months I've tried the Propel mixes, Lipton mixes, and the Crystal Light mixes. Out of all of them the Crystal Light was the best and the Pomegranate Cherry my favorite. It disolves easily in the bottle with little effort. Not like the Lipton that you have to shake the snot out of it for several minutes and still have gobs in the bottom of the bottle that didn't dissolve.<br />  The Crystal Light actually tastes like the flavor that its supposed to be. Again, not like the Lipton that is only kinda, sorta, almost, but not quite, unlike the flavor that its supposed to be and ends up being yuk.<br />  The best thing about it, its a lot cheaper than the others, cheaper than soda pop, & taste better than diet pop. And over the last 2 or 3 months that I've been drinking it I've dropped over 25 pounds. I'm 6'4" and I was over 245 pounds. Now I'm back down to 220 pounds. I'm definitely going to be buying more of this and recommending it to my friends.<br />  And for those of us that every now & then like something a little extra in our drink, a shot of Spiced Rum goes pretty good in it too.

review/text: This flavor is a very good one, though it is a bit stronger than the pomegranate lemonade that I preferred (until they stopped making it).  The first time you try it, it will likely seem to be very strong, but the tart flavor is very good.  Be careful not to spill it though, it will stain...and can even stain your hands.  I make sure to drink a sip out of my 16.9 oz water bottle before I pour in the powder to make it less likely that I will make a mess.<br /><br />Amazon also has a very good price on this.  I found the standard price to be far cheaper than a grocery store, and the subscribe and save price is even cheaper than that.

review/summary: Needs a little dilution
review/text: I mixed it according to the direction and it was awful! So I cut it in half - better, but still like koolaid. Eventually, I diluted one package with three gallons of water and it made a lightly-flavored, refreshing drink. Economical, too.

review/summary: The Best Stuff
review/text: This is the best stuff ever made by a powdered drink vendor in the last century! It not only tastes good, but has actual nutritional value.<br /><br />It is sad to see that it is being pulled off the market, the Cherry Pomegranate drink is getting harder and harder to find. I have had to resort to buying it by the case on-line as stores seem to not carry it anymore.

review/summary: If You Like Berry Taste, You Will Love This!
review/text: This Crystal Light flavor is very robust and heavy on the cherry flavor.  It is not too syrupy sweet either. It is a better taste than most "mixed berries" or cherry products.  It is suppose to help as an antioxidant so that is an added bonus.

review/summary: Tastes Good and Stains well too!
review/text: I like the taste of this one.  It's sweet and refreshing.  Very berry tasting which I enjoy.  This deep red color will stain and also give you that Joker (from batman) looking red smile from cheek to cheek.  Overall it's one of the better tasting flavors out there and it says it's good for you, so can't go wrong on this one.

review/summary: Great for Slow Carb Diet
review/text: I'm no longer drinking calories and one of the ways I've been able to accomplish this is by drinking a glass or two of crystal light each day in addition to tea, coffee and of course water.  I miss drinking something with some taste and all of the crystal light flavors are great - and this is my favorite of them all.  The little packets are great for on-the-go and I have a large sports bottle that takes half a pack.  Love this stuff.

review/text: I love this Crystal Light Pomegranate Cherry.  I've found that I need only 1/2 a packet in my 32 oz water bottle.  If I add the whole packet, it's way too sweet!  It's a nice change from lemonade.

review/summary: Tastes good, drink with care! :)
review/text: This flavor tastes really good. Not too strong, just right for me. Can't beat the extra vitamins to keep my immunity up to par. The only thing to watch out for is its really red. I mix in a 32 ounce water container, and its really red at 32 ounces. In a smaller water bottle it will really stain your clothes for the day if you have any mis-drinks :) . The good news is it comes out in the wash with ease. I have to say that I am a big time Amazon shopper, but the price is a little high on Amazon. I buy at Walmart much lower price, but that could change if Amazon adjusts their prices...Tastes great though, really enjoy it ! :)

review/text: I went over to my sister's house and she had me try the Crystal Light "On The Go" Immunity Cherry Pomegranate and I am in love with it! I don't drink nearly as much water as I should and this will be a great way to change that. Plus, it will help my immune system, what more could I ask for? I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Delicious but not for stain magnets!
review/text: As a new CL convert, I've taken it upon myself to sample all of the different flavors I can. On my latest grocery outing I discovered this little gem. It's cherry pomegranate with extra stuff added to it for immunity defense boosting reasons.<br /><br />Flavor wise, it's a-ok. It doesn't taste as "natural" as some of the other flavors, but it's still tasty. By "natural" I mean it tastes more like a Kool-Aid type of flavor, which should not be construed as a negative thing! Nothing but love for Kool-Aid in my house! This would be a great flavor to give to children on hot summer days, especially children who are prone to summer colds!<br /><br />The only negative side is the coloring. It's a lovely reddish color, very deep & rich looking. (I actually thought to recommend it to some of my vampire role playing friends!) It's just very easy to stain clothing, furniture & clothing with! I recommend a degree of caution when drinking this in anything that can't be bleached.<br /><br />Still, give this a chance! Yummy & good for you!
