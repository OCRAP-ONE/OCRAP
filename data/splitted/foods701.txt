review/summary: Awesome stuff
review/text: My first review, yay! Just received this the other day. So far, I've spread it on crackers (yum), used it on my knees and elbows as a body lotion, and for my night lip balm which I have been looking for an alternative to vaseline ever since I heard that petroleum jelly and other non-digestible ingredients in lipgloss stays inside your system for a long time. Yuck.<br /><br />Love the taste, smell and feel of this product. A little strange to eat something that I also use for a body lotion but I don't mind too much since I love coconut everything. The only thing is that I have to be careful about eating too much of it since it's kinda high calorie (130 calories per tablespoon). Looking forward to using it on homemade popcorn.

review/text: I keep a number of jars of this oil around the house.  One is in the kitchen where we use it everywhere we would use butter.  It is great on toast, corn, steamed vegetables, rice, pasta etc.  The other jar is for our skin.  It is wonderful as a bath oil and a lotion.  I put it the whole family from baby to Daddy.  It smells divine, tastes great and is super softening on the skin.

review/summary: it will change forms on your countertop
review/text: I was a little worried when I got a "JAR" of coconut oil only to have it show up in liquid form...BUT this is totally normal and when the tempeture cools down or the air conditioner is on your Nutiva will appear solid and white...but then if it's hot as blazes like it is here in Sacramento  Ca it will be clear oil that you can actually pour out of the jar...no big deal. And if this is info you already know please excuse my ignorance.<br />the flavor, the consistency are great. I love it and use it in ALL my recipes in place of EVOO or butter...it's really healthy and has so many health benfits I can't even go into all of them.<br />all I know is my sisters red headed son with very fair skin would burn up like a crisp if she didn't put it in her meals but because of eating coconut oil he browns up like a little nut- no burns!!!!!<br />amazing!!!

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: I read many reviews on coconut oil prior to deciding to try this one.  I was excessively pleased with the product.  The taste is very mild in the original form.  I have used it in frying things like french fries and chicken patties and find that it gives a less greasy product and a crispier product in comparison to frying with olive oil. I did not like using it with things like eggs, as there is the slightest residual coconut taste.  I have used it as a substitute in baking cookies, cakes, yeast breads, and quick breads and find the texture preferable to oil and even butter with no coconut after taste.  Would highly recommend this product and will definitely continue to purchase.

review/summary: WOW! Fantastic!!!
review/text: I received my first order a few days ago... originally bought it in the smaller, 15 oz size, thinking that I would mostly use it topically. But then I read in one of the reviews that it is great on popcorn, and decided to give it a try. It was delicious! I found myself licking the spoon- it's really true, what others have stated- the flavor is clean and fresh. Amazing! Since then, we have had it in eggs, and toast, anywhere we can... Try it in your fried potatoes- simply delicious. My dog even gets some in her food too- she loves it, and it's great for her coat!<br /><br />Of course, the way it feels on the skin is simply fantastic. A note about the "smell": to my nose, it does have a faint coconut odor that fades once it is applied to the skin- it is not the overwhelming- and probably synthetic- aroma that comes from sun tan lotions, or "Skin Trip" Lotion (for those of you familiar with it.<br /><br />As for the flavor it lends to food, I find it to be subtle, not overwhelming at all. I can't think of any foods off hand that I would not use it in- and trust me, I know my way around the kitchen... I am sure it would be delicious in baked goods as well.<br /><br />Finally, it has been mentioned in other reviews before, but I think it bears repeating: I ordered my first shipment in January. Since the melting point for this product is (I think it was) 74 degrees, it is worth noting that if you live in a hot climate, and your order is placed during summer months, I can see that there might be a higher risk of product leakage. I will definately factor that in when it comes to re-ordering.<br /><br />Oh, and speaking of re-ordering, I guess I do have one more thing to add: If you are considering which size to get, consider: I ordered the 15 oz (x2) pack, and realized that I will need to order a MUCH larger size next time, as I will be using this for cooking and lotion, etc. If you are just planning to use topically, then I am sure that the 15oz size will be perfect to start!<br /><br />Enjoy! We are thrilled with this product, and will order again soon!

review/text: I have done a ton of research to find an Organic substitute for butter and margarine. I do not use either to cook at home with. I came across this product in a search and checked the USDA website to ensure this was in fact organic coconut oil to be used for cooking and other methods. I use it all the time now that I have done my work on making sure it was a proper substitute. The benefit of this product has been amazing and does not give a bad taste to any food I use it with.

review/summary: Not Impressed
review/text: I've tried a few different kinds of coconut oil. This is average I'd say. The reason I give it 2 stars is the packing. And the quantity.<br /><br />First, the seals were intact on both jars in the 2-pack that I ordered. But there was coconut oil all over the inside of the box, covering the jars, and even on the shipping label. Again, the seals were intact and the jars had no cracks, so I'm not sure why it was all over the place. The white plastic jar lids that covered the seals were both cracked because there was no padding in the large box that it came in. So this was probably from everything rolling around.<br /><br />Now as far as quantity - both jars had huge gaping spaces in the middle. I couldn't see this until the jar was partway gone. Coconut oil is a soft solid at room temperature. It was like the sides and bottom were covered with oil to make the jar look full and then some was squeezed in on top. Both jars were like that. I submitted a shipping complaint and no one responded. You can do better with another product. This is a little cheaper but you are asking for a mess.

Then I ordered the 2-29oz jars and they were leaking and seal broke.  I called costumer service and they told me to discard and they would send me a new order.  Then I got an e-mail saying I needed to return the item.  So I called costumer service and they cleared up the issue.  When I received the new product, it was also leaking.  I just kept it and used it.  I have never received this product without it leaking.

review/text: I purchased oil primarily for use in making popcorn. I was told that coconut oil was what the movie theaters used to make their popcorn so good. The oil is good, not movie theater great, but better that vegetable oil. My complaint and the reason I give it a three out of five is the packaging. It's cheap. Real cheap. The container was tipped over on the counter (did not fall, just tipped 90 degrees) and the plastic container popped the plastic top right off along with half the oil. A more sturdy container would have been make this a non-issue. Hope they make it stronger in the future.

review/text: The best oil I have ever cooked with. It's light and smells wonderful when the oil starts heating up. My children ask me every time I cook what is this nice smell. The coconut taste is almost unnoticable once you're done cooking. I cooked meat balls and pork chops with it. It does have ever so slight taste of sweetness that can be corrcted with a dash of sea salt, but other than that it's great and it's the healtiest oil there is out there. I most certinly did my research on the topic.

review/summary: Good price, fresh tasting organic coconut oil
review/text: I highly recommend Nutiva brand organic seeds, oils, etc. and their Organic Coconut Oil is great.<br /><br />The Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil through Amazon Prime is a great price - especially with Subscribe and Save (note for newbies to Subscribe and Save - it is totally no risk as you can cancel and reschedule to suit your preference, plus Amazon always gives plenty of advance notice via email that your Subscribe and Save item is up for renewal / shipping).<br /><br />As more and more people are realizing these days, healthy fats are important for a healthy endocrine system / hormone production  / hormone balance, and coconut oil is one such oil.<br /><br />I originally began to incorporate coconut oil into my diet because I had read that coconut oil helps to reduce and eliminate candida.  I did find that with the incorporation of the Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil into my diet, my sugar cravings radically decreased, and my candida levels dropped to very, very low levels within a month. (I also switched to using stevia, and very seldom use honey, or maple or agave syrups - probably less than once a month.)  While I did make other dietary changes to eliminate candida, I feel that it is the coconut oil that made the greatest contribution to that end.<br /><br />Primarily I use Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil in my morning smoothies - both fruit and green smoothies.  In the winter I heat it as slightly as possible - i.e., I don't leave it sitting on the flame - to melt it so that it blends well into the smoothies and gives the smoothies a very nice, thick consistency.  In the warmer months this is no issue as the oil stays liquid and I use it straight from the container.  I am not a big fan of cooking with coconut oil, as I don't seem to be able to get it to prevent foods from sticking.  So I just add the oil to my smoothies most mornings, or to dishes after they are cooked rather than using it to saute / etc.  I have also used it in baking and finds it works very well.<br /><br />The Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil has a very light, clean and fresh taste.  Though I cannot ever detect the slight coconut flavor in the smoothies I make, I do sometimes taste it in cooked foods - but, again, it is a very mild coconut flavor, and I keep that in mind when adding it to recipes.<br /><br />I have been buying the two pack of Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil through Amazon's Subscribe and Save for about a year, and am very pleased with both the savings and service I receive through the Subscribe and Save service as well.  I have ordered during the summer and winter months without any problems with leakage during the warmer months when the oil ships in liquid form due to the higher temps. Nor have I ever had a problem with the Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil being rancid ordering through Amazon Subscribe and Save.<br /><br />Other Nutiva products I use and recommend are:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012C7VLG">Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed, 3 Pound Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012C7VLG">Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed, 3 Pound Bag</a> Please note, however, that the I last bought the 3 pound size of Nutiva Organic White Chia Seeds, which is no longer available through Amazon Prime - but I have not found a distinguishable difference between the white and black chia seeds whatsoever.  Also, the 3 pound size of the Nutiva White Organic Chia Seeds I bought through Amazon Prime was about one fourth the price of the 3 pound size of Nutiva Organic Chia Seeds offered by other sellers on Amazon at the time I posted this review - so be sure and compare prices!

review/text: When I first began learning of the benefits of coconut oil, I was shocked.  Now coconut oil is my go-to product of choice - cooking, health, beauty, first-aid.  My husband laughs because I always say "put some coconut oil on .... (whatever is ailing at the moment).<br /><br />Nutiva makes a great coconut oil product. The aroma is delicious, and the taste (raw) is exactly as coconut should taste.  I use it for almost all our baking and cooking oil needs.  When I heat this oil, I find the coconut flavor disappears, i.e. my breads, cookies, veggies, etc. don't taste like coconut.<br /><br />My only complaint about this product is that it comes in a plastic container.  However, I've been buying this brand and product (different sizes on Subscribe & Save, depending on the price at shipping) for two years and don't plan on changing any time soon.

review/text: A friend recommended Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil to me.  I have been delighted to use it in cooking,  on a.m. toast, and as a night cream too.  I also recently read that it is being investigated as a possible cure for Altzheimers.  I have already spread the word about it to other friends.  ^j^

review/summary: I can't say enough about this product!!!
review/text: This is an amazing product. I use it as a face cleanser--it leaves my skin so soft, I put it in my coffee for coconut flavor and in my scrambled eggs because it is so beneficial to the body--antiviral, anti fungal, etc., I rub it on my feet and legs to relieve diabetic muscle cramps. It is a medium chain fat and therefore does not store fat the way other oils do. You can use it in food in place of other oils. It is going to be a staple in my house. (My mom was having an allergic reaction to meds on her skin and we rubbed coconut oil on it and within mins it went away!!!! Also, after having blood drawn I had a big bruise on my arm which as a diabetic would take many months to go away, well I rubbed coconut oil on it and it was gone in about four days!!).

review/text: I recently started seeing an acupuncturist, and among many other changes in my life she suggested, she recommended that I begin using coconut oil as a regular part of my diet. She recommended Nutiva, and although it might be more expensive, it is the highest quality and best tasting. I use this for everything and it really does have a great taste. It's also replaced my night cream, and I now use it as a regular part of my skin care!! I cannot recommend this brand more! If you are thinking about what kind of coconut oil to buy, start here FIRST.

review/summary: Good value!
review/text: this oil is a good value for the price, but definitely not the cheapest extra virgin coconut oil on amazon. So I'm docking it 1 star for that. Probably should take another star, because: It has a mild roasted flavor. So I'm a bit concerned as to how much heat goes into the processing that it achieves a roasted flavor??? I also had some family smell the coconut oil, and the first thing they said was it smells like roasted coconut. Bear in mind, this is the first time I've used coconut oil. I was a little concerned how cooked foods would taste, but to my surprise it wasn't that bad. It wasn't that strong of a coconut flavor that was added to the foods, I have fried chicken & shrimp, tasted just fine & healthy. I have some centrifuged coconut oil on the way, will review and compare soon.

review/summary: Nutiva Organic Coconut oil
review/text: This product is awesome. Coconut oil has a lot of health benefits; you can use it as a skin moisturizer, you can cook with it. It will not turn black in the pan no matter the temperature. It even gives a sweet flavor to food. I purchase the same quaility in a health food store for $15 @ 16oz. So this buy is a steal for as much as I use it.

Great for cooking (eggs, meat, whatever) and for adding to coffee (1 Tablespoon).<br /><br />I learned about coconut oil when I moved to a low-carb / Paleo diet last year.  Coconut oil is a staple for me, and the Nutiva Extra Virgin cold-pressed is the only one I buy.  Good enough to eat straight from the jar!

review/text: This is the first time we have bought this item and we were very pleased with the product.  It arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  It comes in 2 big sealed plastic jars.  I prefer having this shipped in a plastic jar rather than glass so this was perfect.  The product is very white, very slight coconut smell and very, very slight coconut taste.  We have used it for cooking several time so far and like the results.  When we have finished using the 2 jars we will be purchasing again.

review/text: I love this Coconut oil!! I use it everyday for cooking.<br /> It has a very slight coconut taste and scent which might bother some people but I think it adds to the flavor and makes my food more enjoyable. I have added some to my peanut butter for a tasty spread, added some to smoothies, as well as using it instead of butter in baking.<br />I had the smaller containers on the subscription plan but I decided to change over to the larger 29 oz 2-pack.<br />My friends are always asking for a sample to try so it seems to disappear fast!!<br />I also use some of the Coconut oil as a conditioning treatment for my hair and skin when I feel it needs it. We heat with a wood stove during the winter and my skin can get very dry.<br />I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Delicious!!!
review/text: I originally ordered this oil for my 100 year old mother after reading online a case study by Dr. Mary Newport based on research on coconut ketones to reduce the loss of cognitive function and memory in conditions like Alzheimers and, potentially, Parkinsons and MS.  When the oil arrived I gave it a taste test to be sure my mother would find it palatable.  Wow!  This coconut oil is out-of-this-world delicious.  It has a delicate but rich nutty flavor of coconut.  I could literally eat spoonfuls out of the jar.  I have so far resisted that temptation, but I always lick the spoon with which I have scooped it out of the jar.  I do not eat dairy, but when I have a glass of soy milk (Costco's organic vanilla) I heat it in the micro and whisk a tablespoon of coconut oil into it.  The price is excellent, and even better if you subscribe, which I did immediately.

review/summary: FANTASTIC PRODUCT, I USE IT CONSTANTLY, I'll buy Larger Size Next
review/text: The people that say something negative about Coconut Oil, Flour or any good Coconut product Simply Are Uninformed!!! Read about everything good it does for you from the high fiber that is Very Healthy, the Good Omega 3's that your body just doesn't get enough of and So Much More....<br /><br />It has been used in Ayurvedic herbalism for 4,000 years.  Add a little Coconut Oil or 1 or 2 tablespoons Coconut Flour to your Blender drinks. A couple tablespoons per day adds lot of fiber & much more to your diet and help with food cravings.<br /><br />Recent Research has shown the Saturated fats in Coconut Oil are a unique type of fat composed predominately of medium-chain triglycerides. That type of fat is completely different than fat found in meat and other vegetable oils and has a number of health benefits. It protects against Heart Disease and Stroke and research has shown that medium-chain triglycerides also possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Do yourself a "FAVOR" and buy the Cooking with Coconut Flour by Bruce Fife N.D. while it's still available from Amazon. Borders says it's out of print. No Wonder, People are too busy Killing Themselves with all of the good Modern Day Fast Foods, AKA Convenience Foods... That says a lot !<br /><br />IF you want to lose weight with a LOW Carbohydrate Item and Get Healthier at the same time learn about Coconut and all it's Benefits AND How To Properly Use It!!!. Or Else, Ignore This, Go Buy a Cheeseburger & Fries, & gain some More weight before you die. The Cooking w/ Book says Coconut Flour ( Oil & Coconut) are good for Diabetics and overweight individuals. So much to tell about the benefits of Coconut and my fingers are tired of typing. Please do yourself a favor and Buy The Book.<br /><br />Another Book to try is by Cherie Calbom: The Coconut Diet: The Secret Ingredient That Helps You Lose Weight While You Eat Your Favorite Foods (Paperback) on Amazon $11.16<br /><br />Compare what the benefits are against any negatives you may perceive You See Coconut has NO Gluten, NO Carbs, is a High Fiber, Low Glycemic Food, Helps to Regulate Blood Sugar that is all So Good For You!!!!!!<br /><br />ENJOY!!!<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/7/09.  You have heard the Old Adage, "All Things In Moderation" I still Believe this to be an Excellent Product and one of the Highest Quality, However, one of my newly acquired books on foods and inflammation rates this as a "high -" OR "High Minus" which basically says that it needs to be combined properly with other foods to keep everything in Balance. The foods rated with a Minus  - are going into the inflammatory end of the rating while the ones rated with a Plus + are going into the Positive end of the scale which do not cause inflammation.<br />The Coconut Oil is Healthy in Many Aspects just keep it in balance with foods with a positive rating. This information came from a book I just bought from Amazon, The Inflammation-Free Diet Plan by Monica Reinagel.  http://www.amazon.com/Inflammation-Free-Diet-Plan-Monica-Reinagel/dp/0071486011/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1260257694&sr=1-5  ,  I also bought the one by Jessica Black, the Anti-Inflammation Diet & Recipe Book. They're both good & both have recipes, however I like Monica Reinagel's book best for the large quantity foods that are rated on the Plus & Minus scale. They are done alphabetically and by type of food as well. Jessica Black doesn't give rhe individual ratings but she does give recipes with a good balance. I wanted to know the individual ratings as well.

review/text: Ebony and Ivory, side by side in this bag, two great tastes that taste great together. Why can't we all get along as well??? Sweet caramel corn and deep, dark chocolate battling for the most attention from your taste buds, but it ends in a delicious tie.<br /><br />If you're expecting "kettle corn", it's not really like that, it's more like caramel corn but there are not big globs of sugar/caramel like I've had with other brands (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Just enough chocolate, not too much.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the bags are too big for one serving. There's no way you can put it down once you've started, and you end up being a pig. I suggest pouring out a reasonable size serving into a bowl, and then lock up the bag -- make sure you give the key to someone else!

review/summary: Good But Not Great !
review/text: The whole chocolate and healthy kettle corn was just too appealing for me to resist so I ordered this product.  The kettle corn part of this snack is much better tasting to me than other brands of kettle corn.  You can still taste the popcorn and you're not damaging your teeth trying to crunch through whatever sweetener the competition uses on their kettle corn. Nutritionally, this product is as healthy as a snack of this sort can be.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the chocolate part fell short for me.<br /><br />It's just cocoa powder on popcorn so the brown kernels are cocoa tasting and not chocolate tasting as I had hoped.  Also not very sweet.  If you are a person who likes very dark chocolate and not so much the sweetness, you will probably love this product.<br /><br />Re packaging and shipping, the product arrived in perfect condition which all  bags sealed and the same condition you'd find it in at the store.

review/summary: Perfect product - evil packaging
review/text: Like all the other reviewers here, the product quality and care cannot be denied.  The cocoa-drizzled puffs of fresh popcorn are scrumptious, but exist only as a baseline to further take your tastebuds on a roller coaster  peak of glee when you encounter the occasional original caramelized butter kettle kernels.  The whole is certainly greater than the sum of the parts.  I'm enjoying it right now !<br /><br />Unfortunately, selling this amazingly simple and preservative-free "lesser evil" product in a packaging that offers zero ability to recycle, almost forsakes the overall benefit of this great snack.<br /><br />5 stars for product and intent<br />-2 stars for not thinking past the benefit of healthier food, and onto an overall healthier environment.<br /><br />I realize that the aluminum-clad plastic (mylar?) packaging may in fact be the secret weapon allowing them to sell this product preservative-free, and if all other options have been exhausted and there truly is no alternative packaging that can accomplish this, at least put information regarding this fact on the packaging so that those of us concerned can at least know the trade-offs involved.  Trust us, we just want (and can handle) the truth; that's why we were drawn to your product in the first place.

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: Very tasty and about $2/box cheaper on amazon when I bought a 6 pack than individually at my local store. Peanut noodle is much more like the "pad thai" I grew up with than the pad thai flavor which was somewhat icky. The peanut noodle flavor comes with powdered coconut milk as part of the seasoning mix. Quite good for quick lunch (warning: higher calorie). Planning to take some camping, but will empty the take out style box into a ziplock to save space.

review/summary: Great for the price!
review/text: I can't speak for its authenticity as a piece of Thai cuisine, but as a food that takes a few minutes of microwave preparation it is delicious. Rice noodles, ground peanuts, peanut sauce, and powdered coconut milk for the sauce come together to create something pretty tasty! It's sweet and a little spicy and the peanuts add a nice little crunch to it.<br /><br />It's not soupy, either- the sauce is fairly thick once the noodles absorb water, though it's not pasty or anything.<br /><br />If it were healthier it'd get 5 stars. As it stands, though, it's pretty good! I would recommend it, especially if you want something quick and very filling.

review/summary: cat grass
review/text: This is great.  My two, older adopted cats, are strictly indoors.  I start a quarter cup of seeds every 3 months or so, and they love the fresh greens.  If I get behind on schedule, they try to eat houseplants, which is dangerous.  It starts easier than the package suggests.  You do not have to go the dark, covered route.  Just keep it misted.  When the seeds sprout, they take off on their own.  I put a rubber band over the pot, so the grass can grow great and the cats can't get too excited and steal the entire plant. If you don't secure the planting, the cats will take it out of the container.

review/summary: Dissapointingly expensive and dissapointing taste
review/text: This is probably the worst tortellini I have ever bought and eaten. The filling of this pasta does not fully cook unless you completely overcook the pasta shell. This seems to apply to all of the flavors of tortellini that I tried by La Piana pasta. So you can either have over cooked pasta with under cooked filling that crumbles in your mouth or completely soggy pasta with an enjoyable filling. Both options are dissatisfying in their own way. Then there is the taste. The sundried tomato filling tastes off. It reminds me of a all natural ant spray my dad used to use when I was a kid. Not something that you want to eat. So do your self a favor and buy Barilla Pasta instead, cheaper and tastes better.

review/summary: Comparing Kraft's 'Deluxe' mac & cheese dinners
review/text: Amazon sells four Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe dinners. They're all pretty good. Each uses packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder, so the cheese is never clumpy and distributes itself evenly. My husband, teenage daughter and I cooked up all four and did our own taste test. Here's what we found:<br /><br />The Original Cheddar flavor (Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)) is good. Plenty creamy, it tastes like a homemade version of the Kraft standard (i.e., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVRK">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Scooby Doo Shapes, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>).<br /><br />The Sharp Cheddar flavor (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1DSMC">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, Sharp Cheddar, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>) is slightly tastier, and has a subtle smoky aftertaste.<br /><br />The light meal (Kraft Deluxe Macaroni & Cheese Dinner - Light, 14 oz) is pretty good, ut when you try it side by side with the original flavor you can tell it's not as rich. Still, if you only buy this one you'll be happy. If you're counting calories go for it.<br /><br />But it's this one, the Four Cheese meal, that's the best. With the most cheese flavor, it combines American, cheddar, colby and parmesan, and tastes similar to what you'd find at a decent restaurant. The parmesan flavor is especially noticeable.<br /><br />These Deluxe dinners cost about twice as much as the basic Kraft boxes, but in each case you can really taste the difference.

review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: Chose this one because of the creamy cheese vs the powdered cheese even though it was more expensive. I put it on Subscribe and Save because I was certain the family would be wanting it all the time and it would save me time and effort making it from scratch all the time. Received it yesterday afternoon and made it last night for the family as a surprise side dish. It was awful. I don't know if I got a bad batch but the smell of the creamy cheese when I began mixing it with the hot pasta was so foul and nasty I had to open the kitchen windows to clear the stench out of the house. Mind you we're in MA with over 6' of snow right now piled everywhere and filling every nook and cranny available and minus temps and wind chills so believe me, I wouldn't have opened the windows and propped the back door open to get rid of the smell if it wasn't absolutely necessary.<br /><br />I remember having this as a kid, both powdered and creamy cheese but I sure don't recall it having a smell like this. It ruined all our appetites. Because the smell lingered throughout the house, we ended up leaving the house for a while and going out to eat after riding in the open air to clear our nostils. Terrible experience. I was thinking of keeping the remainder of the first order and making it when no one else is home to give to the 5 dogs, but on second thought, if it is a bad batch, I certainly don't want to feed it to my 4-legged babies. Out in the trash it goes and the S&S order canceled.<br /><br />Must admit I'm disappointed. I was hoping to be able to cheat now and then with mac and cheese I didn't have to make from scratch but if this is the alternative, I'll stick to my homemade recipe each and every time.

review/summary: great for replicating iced no sugar added vanilla lattes
review/text: i'd been making iced sugar-free vanilla lattes at home with my espresso machine and some torani SF vanilla syrup, and noticed a certain "funk" in every one of my drinks... frustrated with how much better coffee bean's lattes tasted, i caved in and bought some of their no sugar added vanilla powder at their location nearest to me, and now i'm hooked.  the funk is gone.  and for the record, to those of you for whom this makes a difference, the powder isn't sugar-free.  i'm okay with this -- despite having type 1 diabetes, i'm willing to make the concession for 10g carbs for it to taste leaps and bounds better.<br /><br />my only complaint is that the can is deceptively large -- once you open it, it's only about half full.  i'll be sure to buy a 3-pack soon, as the in-store retail is $11.95.  another helpful tidbit -- add the powder only to the hot liquid, if you're making an iced drink.  first time around i ended up with unsightly clumps...

review/summary: We love love love this powder!
review/text: My husband is an avid espresso drinker. He will make up to 3-4 mochas a day, drinking them before and after work. I'm not a fan of coffee but love tea and drink a comparable amount of tea to his coffee. His favorite coffee house is Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, but they aren't as convenient as Starbucks and he now has a professional set up at home to make his own.<br /><br />Before this product, my husband used flavored syrup like they use at Starbucks and really liked the syrup. I bought this for myself to recreate a sugar-free, chai-tea latte. Husband was skeptical because it was sugar-free, but tried it and loved it. This powder has replaced the syrup and a lot of calories because it's sugar-free. My latte's are also out of this world (I use a chai-blend from Teavana.)<br /><br />Please be advised, my husband found the best results with his mocha by adding both the vanilla and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QNLVCY">The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Chocolate Powder, 16-ounce Containers (Pack of 3)</a>mixed into hot milk. He then combines with the espresso and enjoys hot or over ice.<br /><br />We have both on auto-delivery and frequently run out before our next shipment. Highly recommended (& SUPER great price, these sell for $11.95 per container @ CB&TL)!

review/summary: Coffee Shop taste, but not easy to use
review/text: I ordered this powder after having it at a coffee shop. It is sugar-free, but at 50 calories per 1.5 TBL, not calorie-free. Moreover, when I ordered my cold chai tea latte, the server used 1/4 cup of powder (120 calories) to get the true flavor. She used a blender with chipped ice and it was smooth; at home, when I tried to use it in hot chai (as shown on box), it clumped up and wouldn't mix in. So, while it is tasty, it takes more than the container suggests to get real flavor from it and it is difficult to mix in a hot beverage. Given its price, I am disappointed.

Granted I also use a frother though this vanilla powder honestly is a great tasting product that can make any coffee drinkers morning something to look forward to. One container can last you awhile based on your coffee consumption though with this Three pack it really saves you money than buying them in person from the Coffee Bean itself. The only downfall I have had from ordering them is that shipping can be really rough as one time I had a container smashed open with the other containers all banged and dinged up. The most recent shipment arrived better then the last though still with some of the containers dinged up still though none open.<br /><br />I recommend this great tasting product as it makes all my cups of coffee taste as good as if I bought it from a coffee shop. Great savings though be warned that the containers may not arrive in perfect condition.

review/text: I have made and perfected to my liking my red curry using this paste.  1 can of coconut milk and 1 heaping and not overly loaded tablespoon of red curry will give a very good kick without being to spicy to taste your food.<br />Using a wok I put 1 can of coconut milk with 1 tablespoon of red curry and bring to boil stering till it thickens a bit.  I do not recommend fish sauce since it makes curry taste fishy and not slightly peanuty. I do like seafood and buy smoked salmon often.  But this fish sauce doesn't belong in this dish-trust me.  Less is better with this curry.  So, thicken your sauce add little palm sugar and sea or kosher salt to taste. Taste it to make sure you like it.  It should be spicy, sweet and slightly peanuty.<br />Now add shopped carrots, sliced (thick) bell peppers, asparagus or french green beans,sugar snow peas, onion cut thick, garlic cut in halfs and chopped mushrooms(small). Last time I added to my vegetables half cut of small cuts of fresh pineapple and it was wonderful. Give a good stir and cook till vegetables half cooked then add shrimp and cook it all till shrimp is done to your liking.  If you put shrimps with vegetables shrimp will get overcooked and will be small and rubbery.  I put raw 31-40 raw from Costco shrimp and it is perfect.  Chicken thighs from Costco are very juicy as well but you would want to slice them 1/4" and cook with your vegetables at the same time.  Thicken sauce just a little at the end and serve over Jasmine rice.  Hope you'll like my version of red curry.

review/summary: Fabulous (but pricey)
review/text: Looking for something special on your english muffin Sunday morning?  This is it.  The tangy flavor of cranberries sweatened and mellowed with Cointreau... hmmmm!  Use something good but ordinary during the week like Smuckers strawberry and you'll really appreciate the difference.

review/summary: A Caveat
review/text: The popcorn itself is yummy, just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper.  The kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped.  It's great in the microwave or a pan, but maybe the larger white or yellow would be a better match for an air popper.

review/summary: Great Popcorn
review/text: I won't claim to be a professional food taster ... I just know what I like and don't like.  I don't like "yellow" popcorn, I don't like microwave popcorn, I like the "white" popcorn cooked in a pan.  For my "popping style" the Baby White pops great w/o lots of hard kernels.  'nuf said.

review/summary: Tender
review/text: I was a little concerned to buy the popcorn, as you never know what you are going to get.  But I did and I am glad I did.  The popcorn is nice and tender, pops easy, great taste and hull-less.  I have moved from the microwave popcorns and glad I did because of this product.  I like the fact the the popped corn is small but great!

review/summary: Shipping is INSANE!!!
review/text: I love the popcorn, but the shipping costs are INSANE!! A total rip off. Wabash Valley Farms or Amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind. 5 Stars for the popcorn. Minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping. Argh...Yes, the popcorn is tender and luscious, and it melts in your mouth like you're eating cooked grasshoppers, but come on!!! Can't you ship this product for less?<br /><br />Shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse. *sigh* Too bad really.

review/summary: Our Favorite Popcord
review/text: We like the much harder to find "white" popcorn over the more common "yellow" popcorn and Amish Country Baby White is our absolute favorite.  We usually order 3 of the 6 lb bags 'cause we go thru it so quickly.

review/summary: good popcorn
review/text: I love this popcorn. Only downside is the shipping and packing. Cost almost as much as the popcorn. Need to pack it better. Bag split and a bunch of loose popcorn falling out of the box when the guy brought it to my door.

review/summary: Too small, too much shell & not enough white fluffy part
review/text: I purchased the baby white by accident.  We usually get the medium white, which is great.  The baby is so small when popped that the taste and texture of the hull shell really overwhelm it.

review/summary: Tasty popcorn but kernels too small for a hot air popcorn popper
review/text: Tasty, small kernel popcorn. However, too small and too light to be popped in a hot air popcorn popper. The kernels are blown out of the popper before they are popped.

review/summary: Small pops
review/text: The gourmet corn is smaller kernels than I like so would probably not buy it again.  But with their special oil and the Stir Crazy Popper every kernel pops every time.<br /><br />I will probably return to good old Jolly Time.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: This is the best popcorn i have ever ate. I use a Whirley Popper to pop my popcorn. When you eat this baby white hulless you will never go back to any other popcorn. I gave my Orville Redenbacher's  and Walmart popcorn away..To many husks. You just can't beat this popcorn. It tastes sooooo good even my puppy loves it.

review/summary: Amish Baby White Popcorn
review/text: I first had this popcorn at my 84 year old cousin's home. I thought it was so tender and delicious, and I wanted to buy some for myself. I found it on Amazon.com believe it or not!!!  Anyway, I ordered 6 pounds of it. All 6 pounds are now gone. This popcorn is REALLY good. It is different than other popcorns I have eaten because the kernels are small and very delicate. I consider myself a pro when it comes to popcorn because I have eaten it every night since I was a little girl. I usually eat my popcorn 1 kernel at a time, but since the kernels are so small, I ate it by the handful. My only complaint is that it does cost a lot to have it shipped. I wish I could find it locally so I would not have to pay for the shipping costs. If you like popcorn, I highly recommend it.

review/text: This is the best popcorn I have ever had.  As a kid I ran the popcorn machine in a theater so I feel I know what I'm talking about.  We used yellow popcorn but I still think white is best.
