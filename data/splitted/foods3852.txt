review/summary: Goji Gold
review/text: I have been taking this juice now for a few years. I would not be without it! Goji Gold gives me energy and makes me feel good. It also has lots of antioxidants in it which are good for you. I take one ounce each morning on an empty stomach. That's all I need to feel good and have energy.

review/summary: A staple for me...
review/text: I started drinking Goji juice a few months ago, per the request of an acupuncturist, and ever since I tried it, I've been hooked. Supposedly it's a "blood builder," but don't expect super fast results for that function. While it might kick in eventually, it does take awhile, but the overall nutritive qualities of this food are near close to being unparalleled: it is a super food and anyone looking for an ULTRA healthy pick-me-up would do good to try this out. It is chock full of Amino Acids and many vital minerals and is deeply fortifying. It also adds a nice dose of Vitamin C, which is helpful in the cold and flu season. Drink to good health!

Yep my condition eased from day ONE.I took more than the recommended dose that day (maybe 4x the recommended dose)'cause I thought "Hey it can't hurt .It 's just fruit juice !"Since the second  day I have taken the dose, recommended on the bottle .As long as I drink this, I have no problem with dry eyes and my normally dry ,chapped lips are magically transformed  !It is a very pleasant sweet-tasting juice .I have tried other types of Goji Juice, but ,so far ,this is the only one, that has alleviated my dry eye condition.Love it ,love it love it .

review/text: Got 10 bottles from Vitacost about 3 months ago.  I mix it with the smoothie and give it to my son.  When I finished the first bottle and opened the second one, I found the juice was bad and tasted like vineger. I sent an email to Vitacost but I couldn't return them because it passed one month period.  I wouldn't know the juice is bad unless I open it.  I've had this juice for 2 years.  This is the second time the juice went bad.  The first time I got replacement but not this time.  You can also see the photos I uploaded.

review/text: This is my second time buying Goji juice from this account. The 1st 2 bottles I bought were red, sweet, and tasted fruity. The 2nd time I bought 2 bottles the juice was orange, tasted like a smokey rotten fruit, and the lable was different. I'm very disappointed because I thought if I bought from the same company, I would get the same product. How do I get my money back for this trash I was sent? I will never buy Goji online again. It's a great product but being stored wrong and sent to the buyer wrong. I'm very upset with my purchase. SUCH a waste of money. DO NOT BUY GOJI ON AMAZON!

I thought that this product might kick in her immune system to fight them off.  Upon taking it, her current sores weren't healing and she got some new ones.  I am having her finish out the bottle (it was expensive and can't hurt), but I won't be buying her another one.<br /><br />On the other hand, it does appear to be 100% Goji juice as advertised and not some sort of cocktail mix.

review/summary: So fun!
review/text: I purchased this for my 7, 8 and 10 year old daughters.  They absolutely loved it.  They were able to follow the recipe and bake the cupcakes with minimal help from me.  I did help them smooth out the frosting on the cupcakes so the edible decals would transfer over better.  The decals were very easy to put on and my girls were able to do it by themselves as well.  They then painted the decals with the edible paints and that was their favorite part.  The colors were not as bright as shown on the box, but my girls didn't seem to mind.  They were just amazed they got to eat the pictures and the paint!  I mean, how often do you get to paint on food?!  The cupcakes and frosting actually tasted decent as well.  The only down side was that it only makes 8 cupcakes, so my youngest only got to paint 2.  They all wished they could have painted more! A fantastic rainy day activity that kept them busy for 2+ hours.

review/text: Del Monte makes a great product in the mixed fruit cups, but an absolutely superb product in the diced peach cups.  Just like Mom used to can oh so many years ago!  The peaches are tart and sweet at the same time.  I'm not sure if it can get any better than this. Both products are very convenient in the 4 ounce plastic cups, they cool fast in the fridge, don't take up a lot of room, the lids remove easily, and the cups and lids are easy to dispose of.  Thanks Amazon for providing this product, and making it seem easy, too!

review/summary: how can diced fruit in syrup be bad?
review/text: I purchased these to eat as snacks and got exactly what I paid for!<br />What you get are handy little cups filled to the brim with mixed diced fruit (mostly peach & pear) with just enough syrup to keep the fruit wet.<br />Be careful when you peel back the lid to open them cause they are so full that it is easy to get the sticky syrup on your hands and on the counter.<br />The taste is  good - the same taste you would get eating a can of fruit cocktail, just in a small portable package.<br /><br />The portion is a bit on the small side (probably made for a child's school lunch) but is enough for a snack.<br />If you're really hungry, just open two!<br /><br />I am enjoying these, would recommend them and will order them again.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CN34VO">Del Monte Quality 16 Plastic Cup Variety Pack of Mixed Fruit and Diced Peaches</a>

review/summary: Retro Gum
review/text: I was never a user of this gum back in the day, but recently took up the gum habit once again. In looking for a gum with the least amount of added "stuff" and phony sweeteners I came across this gum-straight from 100 years ago..<br /><br />Since it`s only a gum and not a laptop I`ll keep this simple..<br /><br />The gum is enjoyable. Its clove flavor is subtle and has just the right amount of sugar to make it not too sweet. The gum while being chewed is rather firm as opposed to Bazooka or other bubble gum. The clove flavor slips away after a short time but remains in your mouth. If you don`t like cloves you might not like this gum but the clove flavor is not overpowering.<br /><br />Looking for a gum without fake sweeteners and a unique flavor, this might be for you!

review/text: I have a lot of childhood memories that included CLOVE GUM. It was always a favorite of my Mom and considered a real treat! My Mom recently celebrated her 91st birthday. I found several nostalgic surprises for her on Amazon including GLOVE GUM. She was thrilled. Some things never change.

review/summary: If you like cloves, you'll love this gum!
review/text: I love love love this gum!  I used to find it at World Market, but they have stopped selling it.  It was $1 per pack, so this is a little better deal at 20 packs for less than $18, but not by much.<br /><br />The clove taste is "full" but not too strong.  It's definitely not like the cinnamon in "Big Red" that burns your tongue it's so strong.<br /><br />The gum does lose it's flavor somewhat quickly, but not so fast that it would deter me from buying it.<br /><br />If you like cloves, you should definitely try this gum!

review/summary: Clove Gum - The wrapper taste lasts longer - wast of money
review/text: The gum was hard (very old) The flavor lasted less than 2 minutes - no exaggeration. This product is a waste of money.  Dentyne is far superior not to mention so many long lasting refreshing flavors out there today.  Maybe that's why this one is not carried by your local drug store or supermarket - nobody would buy it a second time.

review/text: Being French I grew up knowing how important it was to use a good unrefined salt. The one from Brittany being the very best. No! It's not foolish to spent money on a  basic spice. It has a very delicate flavor (almost floral) and you don't need a lot. Will taste great on salads. A clear healthy winner.

review/summary: Wow
review/text: Not really sure if I can describe this salt properly. Yes, it has a wonderful flavor without too much of a salty flavor. It's very clean tasting. Mostly, though, I think it seems "creamy". Yea, I know that sounds weird, but the moisture with the salt gives it a creamy-salty embodiment. I use this for special dishes to add a delectable flavor to a dish...also knowing that I'm serving food with a healthy salt with tons of minerals.

review/summary: Great stuff,and a must to have
review/text: I got into salts, the more I learned to cook.  Firstly all salt is salt,  but different textures appeal differently on your palate.  They seem so anyway.  Now the darker shades of salt do have different minerals, depending where they're from.  You need to be careful though , remember these gourmet salts do not have iodine, so make sure you continue to use table salt, though it is hard to do so.  Love this salt on salads and steak,  trust me.

review/text: Got this stuff and it looked like they just swept it off the beach . I think its still wet actually. We got the course and we grind it ourselves. We love it. We even took a taste test, first this French gray , then Mortons salt. Hands down we could taste the difference and we could taste how much better the French Gray was. I would get the fine salt next time. I wanted that but must have hit the course by accident. We still like it! You will too. Worth every dollar. And now im spoiled.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.<br /><br />To me, "French gray" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table.

We searched for it at the local grocery store, zip, nada, zilch.  Lots of internet recipes for how to make your own.  Too much bother.  It was required in a recipe we wanted to try, so we decided to have a jar shipped to us.  It made the dish really great.  Then I tried it on my next hamburger.  Wow, love it.  My wife said it made her tummy unhappy later, but her system generally has the same response to all onions.  So if you're OK with onions, you'll love the sweet onion confit.

review/summary: Puts ferrets at risk for insulinoma
review/text: Unfortunately, while ferrets LOVE these treats, they may put ferrets' health at risk. Ferrets are carnivorous, requiring quality proteins and fats, and sugar and carbohydrates are exceptionally bad for ferrets and puts them at great risk for a condition called insulinoma. Before we knew about diet and insulinoma in ferrets, we treated our ferrets to these per the instructions on the package and never really read the ingredients, trusting that a company marketing a product for ferrets would know what is safe and healthy to feed them. At about 4-5 years of age, all of our ferrets began displaying some strange symptoms: wobbly gait, staring off into space, increased urination, and later lethargy, extreme weight loss, inability to stand or walk at all, glazed eyes, and eventually a slow, painful death after 1-2 months of symptoms. It was horrifying, and agonizing to watch and have veterinarians say there is nothing that can be done at this stage. After consulting with many veterinarians after multiple ferrets displayed these same symptoms, we were able to narrow down exactly what was going on: insulinoma, caused by supplementing our ferret's diets with treats containing sugar and grains. We beat ourselves up over having caused our ferrets to live shortened lives by 1-2+ years just because we wanted to spoil them. These treats contain sugar as the first ingredient, which ferrets cannot properly metabolize. PLEASE, read up on the condition called insulinoma in ferrets and its link to sugar and carbohydrates in their diet, and come to an educated decision on what to feed your ferrets. We wish we had.

Our dog is 10 pounds and she has to take her time with each kibble since they are a little large, but it doesn't pose a problem for her.  I just wish they made a kibble for small dogs.

review/summary: Fantastic iced
review/text: My husband prefers orange spice teas, he has a favorite hot one, a favorite herbal orange spice blend and this is both of our favorite for iced tea. The flavor is very strong and it is so naturally sweet that we never add sugar or any other sweetener to it. I suggest it to friends who are dieting for it's strong flavor and sweetness.<br />It's delicious. I find it a bit too strong hot, but over ice it's amazing.

review/summary: This Should be Called - "OMG ie The -ishest TEA Ever Tea"
review/text: So I'm so disappointed in myself for not tracking this tea down for home use earlier. I've encountered it on my many trips to Seattle, but never was motivated to make it a regular brewing pleasure at my house. This tea has all but completely displaced my morning coffee as it seems to pack a much more potent punch to the cardio system than does the 3x shot Latte (although I don't claim empirical data to support that).<br /><br />It has an incredible aroma, which to me is like breathing in sunshine - a definite plus during the winter months of the Northwest. I use a French Press to brew the loose leaf variety but the teabags work just as well.<br /><br />If your a fan of strong spiced tea, don't hesitate to purchase and become a regular.<br /><br />On the business side, there is nothing to worry about. Quick shipping, great quality, local business... what more do you want?

review/text: I believe, I bought this tea before under a different name and have been searching for it ever since. It's flavor is strong and sweet and wonderful.  I would buy their spearmint tea along with it.  I'm not sure they produce it any longer, but the I liked the spearmint even more.  It had the same strength of flavor and sweetness.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Cinnamon Citrus Tea
review/text: As a classic Seattle tea, this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea. When I drink this tea, I am home again. This tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of Seattle in one cup.<br /><br />This is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors. You can sweeten this more if you like with Stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness. It is good with a touch of Muscovado Sugar from India Tree.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Having not been to the place where other folks have tried this, I'm guessing the market is a lot of the charm with this tea.  Its ok, but its not the greatest tea I've ever had.  It is spicy, and its sweet, but I prefer to control my own tea sweetness.  I'm happy that others have found a tea they enjoy, but this one just isn't it for me.  I will finish my box but not sure if I will get more.

I put a tea bag in a cup of water and put it in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes and it comes out just fine!

review/text: I first tried this product when visiting Seattle.  It is love at first taste.  I like only sweet drinks, but was amazed when informed that the tea bag contained no sugar of any kind.  I have recommended this to all of my friends, including one who has a severe weight problem and is tired of just drinking water.  This is a great pick-me up during the day or to start your day and I ordered the decaffinated version for evening.  Both types are wonderful.  The service and the product is superb.

review/summary: Not really earl grey...
review/text: I wouldn't call this a true, delicately subtle floral Earl Grey. The tea, no matter how long or which style it is brewed in, is overly tannic, like a cheap supermarket brand of black tea. It is lovely to smell, disappointing to drink - very little citrus tones (as in, none I could detect) with just the slightest tang of bergamot oil. Extremely disappointing. A good buy if you do not enjoy earl grey but love the smell.

review/summary: Indistinct, stale.
review/text: Reading the other reviews, I wonder whether I got a stale box! My tea tasted bland and even dusty. I couldn't taste the slightest bergamot. It was like something you would drink when you're camping in the boonies and it's raining and you have no other way to heat up. Like something out of one of those giant yellow Igloo dispensers you see at tailgate parties on foggy November mornings. I would rather drink hot water. After I tried this, I dumped out my mug and threw the box and its 15 remaining organic tannin packets into the compost! Ashes to ashes.

review/text: I found this product featured on www.organicgrocerydeals.com and the members there spoke highly of this brand of organic tea.<br /><br />When my package arrived I could smell the yummy Earl Grey scent waft out of the box as soon as I opened the standard Amazon packaging. I immediatly put on my copper tea kettle to boil water so I could taste this heavently scented tea.<br /><br />I made my cup of tea with a bit of honey and a splash of organic milk and sat down to drink. I was very happy with the flavor of this tea and will purchase this brand again when I run out. I normally drink Bigelow tea purchased in the grocery store but as of this writting I have not seen an organic Earl Grey tea in my local grocery stores.<br /><br />Choice Organic Earl Grey Tea + Honey + Organic Milk + Toasted English Mufffin with butter and marmalade = the best breakfast in the world!
