review/summary: Think of this product as a delicious starting point....
review/text: My wife and I love Indian food - I prefer the hotter the better, but she prefers mild with rich flavors.  The Tiger Tiger products fall right in the middle as an excellent compromise.  We've tried the Chana Masala, Mutter Paneer and Veggie Korma, all with excellent luck, but with a word of advice.  If you think of these products as complete meals (as they are advertised), you will be pleased but not blown away.  However, if you think of them as an excellent place to start, then the possibilities are endless.<br /><br />With the Chana Masala, we usually add another can of chick peas and some cilatro or other herb that cooks well.  Then we just let it simmer on the stove top for 30-60 minutes.  With very little supervision, and medium low heat, you won't have any concerns over burning, and like many "saucy" foods, it just gets better with time.  They give this a 3-star spice rating, but it is NOT hot in any sense of the word.  I usually add a little chili oil to my serving to punch it up because it adds hot without affecting the flavors.<br /><br />The Mutter Paneer is excellent as is, and the only thing we have found that we like to add is a very healthy dose of chopped fresh spinach.  Spinach is already one of the ingredients, so we just put the Tiger Tiger sauce in a pan and add about 6-8 oz of fresh spinach.  It takes about 7-10 minutes for the newly added spinach to cook down, and the result is great.<br /><br />The Veggie Korma is probably the easiest to doctor up because it closely resembles a sweet Thai curry sauce (in our opinion, anyway).  You can add any combination of steamed vegetables (green beans, broccoli, asparagus, carrots, etc.) and protein (chicken, shrimp, fish, tofu, etc.) and you'll almost certainly come up with an excellent product.<br /><br />As for comments on the rice - it's all a matter of taste.  The Basmati Cumin rice packaged with the Chana and Korma is on the al dente side, but this can be helped by adding a little water to the packet before you microwave, and then cooking it a little longer.  The flavor is fine, but not very intense.  Our favorite is the Basmati Pilau rice packaged with the Mutter Paneer as it starts softer and has a little more flavor to it.  We do find that when our creations are done, we sometimes need to steal the rice from an uncooked package, and when we use plain old brown rice the next time, it's not a huge loss.<br /><br />Finally, one reviewer stated they had lots of sand or grit in their meals.  We have probably eaten 15-20 of these so far with zero occurrence of any contaminants in our food.<br /><br />I'm giving the product 5 stars because I feel it is an excellent tasting product, that when purchased on sale (think $12-$15 per case instead of $25) is an exceptional value.  If you are a regimented cook who likes to follow the rules you may not enjoy the more relaxed method with which we experiment.  In that case you may wish to try these individually from the store before purchasing in bulk.  In any event, I feel you'll be pleased with the results, even if you think you know better.

review/summary: Fantastic Flavor!
review/text: Quite honestly I did not believe you could get quality "instant" Indian fare.  Amazon's special pricing me decide to try three cases, the Chana Masala, Paneer and Taka Dal.  There are two plastic bags, one rice, the other the sauce. I had no trouble heating them to boiling hot in my small microwave.  Truly delicious, spicy which should appeal to those with leanings towards Mexican or Sezchaun Chinese.  The only negative and diabetics beware, a single serving of any these three may provide 100 grams of carbs or more!

review/summary: Authentic ...a real taste of India.
review/text: Would have given this a four or five star rating if not for two problems. The first was the food is not completely cooked, quite "al dente". Both the rice and chick peas in sauce required additional cooking. The taste is quite good but what rates this a one star review is the "dirt/sand" contained in the meal. I tried both the Chana Masala and the Mutter Paneer and both had a bit of crunchy, gritty in it.

review/summary: Tasty, but doesn't carry the meal
review/text: My family doesn't eat a lot of Indian food, so this was sort of a step out of our comfort zone. I really enjoyed it through! It was easy to cook, and very tasty. I don't really see it as a main dish the way I'd been thinking it would be, though. I would definitely serve it along with something else, and maybe with bread as well. I put some of the leftovers on a piece of french bread and it was surprisingly tasty! If you don't eat a lot of Indian food, I think this is a great starting point.

review/text: I bought this because it was sale and I was feeling hopeful. On sale it was a reasonable $4 a package. However, the rice is awful - couldn't even get past the smell to eat it (and I usually adore cumin)! The channa masala is passable. Tasty, but runny and not many chickpeas. I'll be saving the rest of the sauce for late night curry cravings, but from now on I'm sticking to my own recipe.

review/text: Wolfgang Puck's Chef's Reserve Colombian (Dark Roast) is basically what they said it will be. Dark roast, but not too strong. Acidity is on a low side, but with plenty of pleasant taste. At the same time you can drink this coffee black w/o the need for the sweetener and/or milk. This coffee is in European tradition and will please many people. I would recommend it after dinner, but not if you need a jolt to wake you up.

review/summary: My mom said this was not as flavorful as other "Extra Bolds"
review/text: This is the most USEFUL info you will ever need to know about K-Cups, and one that took me forever to discover:<br /><br />Bold/Extra Bold coffee in terms of k-cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger, it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee.<br /><br />There! Now you know.<br /><br />My mom goes for the Extra Bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now, and she's frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck (or rather mine, since I buy it for her).<br /><br />Unfortunately, out of all the Extra Bold k-cups she's tried, she claims that the Wolfgang Puck is the weakest tasting. She's tried it in both the medium & small serving sizes format, and both have produced less-than-full-flavor drinks.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rich, flavorful, strong-tasting coffee, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ7A">Van Houtte Cafe Honduras Medium Roast, Extra Bold Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.

Some reviews said it was not so good, not enough flavoring, etc. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here. I have never posted for a product and I have tried many different k-cups. This is a good k-cup and don't hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback. I almost hesitated and didn't buy it and then I figured I would give it a shot. It was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor. You will enjoy it. It tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor.

review/summary: Too Mild for Me
review/text: I bought this because Amazon had DRASTICALLY increased the price on what I usually buy, so I thought I'd try something new.  I normally drink Coffee People Donut Shop, which is a nice, strong cup of coffee.  This was a little disappointing.  It's called a Medium Roast, but when I brew a large cup (my Keurig has 3 size options), it looks like strong tea - very light in color.  It makes a very weak cup of coffee.  When I brew the smallest cup possible, it's a tiny bit better, but I prefer a large cup of strong coffee.  Think I may try the Rodeo Drive or Sorrento, but this one is just too weak and light for me.  (Oddly enough, the first time I tried Donut Shop, I thought it was too strong...as I had been used to weaker coffees.  Now that I've started drinking the stronger varieties, it's hard to go back to "brown water.")

If you like a stronger cup in the morning, without being bitter, give this one a try.

But IF what you are drinking is a FLAVORED coffee, then the ingredients in it are Arabica coffee, and flavorings...  But IF what you're drinking is a DECAF variety, then it contains Arabica coffee that has been decaffeinated with Ethyl Acetate, as is standard.<br /><br />So if you're not holding a decaf variety, then there is no decaffeinated beans!  It is nothing more than generic catch all ingredients that apply to whichever variety you happen to be looking at.<br /><br />Sheesh.  Think people! lol

review/text: I wish Amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such.  Then folks who really dislike coffee adulterated this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee.  This stuff tastes the way I imagine Newman's Own Extra Bold coffee would taste with curdled, spoiled Bailey's Irish Cream dumped in it - nasty.  Shudder!!!

review/summary: Good, but not my favorite
review/text: I like strong, but smooth coffee. This coffee is strong enough, but a little on the bitter side for my taste. I have tasted other strong blends that I like much more. My husband, who likes a medium roast coffee, is OK with this coffee, but it not his favorite either. I would only recommend it to someone who likes a little tang in their morning cup of joe.

review/summary: These K Cups Have ISSUES - Coffee Not Bad
review/text: First of all, I have owned a Keurig for about 4 years now, and I've tried lot's of coffee.  During that time, I have had an occasion k cup that didn't function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds.<br /><br />I probably should have returned these before I bothered to open the second box.  Since I drink my coffee from a thermal cup, I can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks.<br /><br />I have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee.  Its a bit like Russian Roulette, and I've started straining it after I brew it.<br /><br />I know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the Green Mountain, Timothy's or Tully's that I also use.  The good cups are a bit weak for my taste, but the flavor is ok.  Definitely prefer not to waste $'s on a product with a manufacturing defect.

review/summary: Good, but not Wolfgang Puck good
review/text: Honestly, I have to admit that I expected a little better. That's not to say that this is bad coffee - in fact it's quite bold without being too acidic, and pretty satisfying overall. I think my main problem is that Wolfgang Puck's name is attached to it, so perhaps it set my expectations a little high. I have a Wolfgang Puck knife set that I adore, and is very high quality for what I paid for it. This coffee was on sale, so it was well worth it also, I just hoped for something that would knock my socks off - which it didn't. I also purchased the Breakfast blend, and Jamaica me crazy at the same time. The breakfast blend was the best, in my opinion, and the jamaican coffee smelled the best, but was the least successful.

review/text: I'm not a gourmet coffee critic, but this stuff is disappointing.  Based upon previous good reviews, I suspect that the coffee in the K-cups I received is not the same -- they may have changed the manufacturing.  The Wolfgang Puck Decaf I received is lifeless, watery, and tasteless.  There's no aroma when it's brewing in the Keurig.  Never again.

review/summary: Somewhat disappointing
review/text: Perhaps my expectations were too high. When I see the name "Wolfgang Puck", I expect to be impressed. This (to my taste) is very average tasting coffee. To be fair, it is billed as a medium roast, and that's what it is. However, it's just too bland for my taste.<br /><br />If you want decaf with more character, try Green Mountain Coffee's Dark Magic Decaf <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I2SK">Green Mountain Coffee Decaf Dark Magic, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a>, or Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004616B3Y">Emeril's Jazzed Up DECAF 48 K-Cups</a>. They are darker roasts though, so if you want a milder coffee the Wolfgang Puck might be what you are looking for.

review/summary: Hawaiian Hazelnut Always Out of Stock
review/text: The Hawaiian Hazelnut is my favorite K-Cup flavor from any vendor, but it's ALWAYS out of stock on Amazon.com; it seems that all of the other Puck flavors are available for a very reasonable $16.54/24-cup price and sold directly by Amazon.com, but HH's price fluctuates wildly from 3rd-party resellers and hasn't been available directly from Amazon.com for months.  As I'm writing this (8/24/12) the price of a 24-pack is $34.99 from the cheapest 3rd-party retailer, which is absolutely ridiculous.  AMAZON, why can't you stock the Hawaiian Hazelnut the same way you stock the other flavors??  The fact that I would take the time to write a review about this should tell you how much I like the product...

review/summary: Good taste, but seals are loose so they're busting open while brewing
review/text: The vanilla coffee taste is pretty good and mild, as I expected. But I bought it for a discount from the Amazon Warehouse (otherwise K-Cups are a little expensive). When Amazon does this, it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly.<br /><br />As I expected, the expiration date is for a month or two from now, so they were trying to get rid of them. I also noticed the seals didn't seem as tight as they normally are. This also could be because it was sitting in Amazon's warehouse in the heat all summer.<br /><br />As I expected, about half of these K-cups burst open while brewing. (This is not usual, and I've tried many different brands.) This made them leak (so clean-up was kind of annoying) and not taste as fresh, but it still tasted decent. Bottom line: When K-cups are discounted from Amazon Warehouse, be ready to pay in other ways! lol

review/text: I too purchased this product thinking it might not be a flavored product, and before it arrived I looked it up to see that there was some rumor as to a coconut flavor.<br /><br />So, lets get this out of the way. *********Do Not Purchase this is you do not like flavored coffee. It is flavored.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is a deep coconut aroma, almost akin to Hazelnut in its presentation. The initial mouthfeel is good, a light roast but a snappiness to the roast which settles in nicely with the flavor, which<br />has a definite dark chocolate taste without the bitterness.<br /><br />The finish is semisweet chocolate, Jamaican coffee and faint toasted coconut.<br /><br />Bottom Line: if you like flavored coffee with coconut/hazelnut/cocoa profiles, you will like this coffee.

review/text: I got one K-Cup of Wolfgang Puck's Colombian Reserve dark roast as part of a variety 35-pack that I bought here on Amazon. Since I'd always assumed that I preferred the less-burnt flavor of a light or medium roast, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the way this coffee sat on my tongue. It is sweet, full, and gently bitter. I brewed it in a 9.25 oz. cup in an effort to dilute it a little, but I may be gutsy enough to try a 7.25 oz. cup the next time around.

review/summary: Smells amazing!
review/text: I'm not a huge flavored coffee fan. Usually I prefer lattes with flavored syrups. A friend sent me a K-Cup to try and the smell was mouth watering before it even finished brewing. The flavor was strong enough to drink it only with milk; I added a little vanilla syrup when I reheated it. I am not a coconut fan but the flavor is barely there. It is just a unique taste for when you're in the mood for something different!

review/text: I've tried a wide selection of k-cups including the big names like Starbucks, Tully's, Donut House, Dunkin Donuts, etc and they all have something in common.. either too watery (weak) or too bitter (strong). I tried Breakfast in Bed based on the reviews and I was not disappointed. It's flavorful without being strong or weak. It's hard to get a cup of coffee from a Keurig that tastes like it was brewed like a normal coffee machine.. this k-cup is the exception.. I'll be stocking up.

Not only is the aroma delightful, the flavor is excellent as well.  I drink my coffee black and this one has no bitter after taste and the flavor isn't overpowering.  The flavor is a very light coconut and the coffee is a medium body.  I must admit that I was a little hesitant about a "coconut" flavor.  DON'T BE!  Everyone around me wants a cup....I refuse to share!

review/text: Good choice for your morning coffee if you like a medium, slightly bold flavor.  Vienna coffee is not a real bold coffee, so medium roast coffee drinkers should like the flavor.<br /><br />Vienna Coffee House has less of a kick than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXFL1Q">Wolfgang Puck French Roast (Dark Roast), 24-Count K-cups (Pack of 2)</a>), but a little more than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast, Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>.<br /><br />Good flavor, slightly sweet with a good bean taste that isn't tough on your stomach.<br /><br />To the manufacturer: please revise your coffee descriptions - they are terrible and give the consumer no information on the flavor/style of coffee featured.  If you want us to buy the coffee, be forthright on your descriptions.

review/summary: Another great dark K-cup coffee
review/text: I love the rich, full-bodied flavor of a dark-roast coffee.  When I bought my first Keurig machine I wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast K-cups that I could find.  I initially settled on Newman's Own Dark Roast as my "go-to" coffee, but I didn't stop there.  I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new.  I happened to find Coffee People's Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away.  It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it.  Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try.  Here is my impression of it:<br /><br />After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story.  It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness.  I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People's Extra Bold and this will be my back-up brand.  However, I will keep looking for something new.  Who knows what I will find?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7GYY">Newman's Own&iquest; Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]

review/summary: Not Outstanding. Light to Medium Roast. Smooth, Not Acidic.
review/text: I love the names Wolfgang Puck gives to their coffees, but the coffee descriptions leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />In this case, with "Breakfast in Bed", I expected a much more flavorful cup of coffee than delivered.  "Breakfast in Bed" is on the light side of the medium roasts and has a mild, but not very memorable flavor.  On the plus side, it is a smooth coffee and not acidic at all.<br /><br />A better choice, in my opinion, is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast, Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>, which also comes in the 50 pack.<br /><br />ADDED: Another nice, smooth medium blend is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002APWQ0K">Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend for Keurig Brewers, Medium, 50-Count K-Cups</a><br /><br />ADDED: for those who prefer a lighter smooth blend, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00196QVPM">Keurig Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 80 K - Cup Colombian Fair Trade Slect Medium Roast Coffee</a> (link for product description only, not for best pricing).

review/summary: This coffee is now DECAFF!
review/text: One reviewer mentioned that this coffee was decaff and said it was listed as such on the bottom of the box (in small print). I checked my current box and saw no such labeling information. HOWEVER, the new boxes I received are a different color, with a slapped on label for Hawaiian Hazelnut and NOW the bottom of the box says it's made from 100% decaff coffee. While I like the flavor, I do NOT want decaff in the morning, which is when I drink coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am unable to return this item to Amazon because of their return policy, which is why I'm writing this review, to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now. I would give more stars for flavor, but the lack of official notification in the product description that this coffee is decaff makes me feel as if I tossed my money out the window, buying something I would not have otherwise ordered.

review/summary: Great Cuppa...except
review/text: Ok, now on our third box of Breakfast in Bed. We had become fans of Donut House and Coffee Shop, looking for that balanced smooth "Dunkinesque" brew. We found ourselves coming up just a bit short in the strength/flavor area. Corrections were made in brew size and eventually adding in a bit of Emeril's Bold or various dark roasts. Well problem solved with the B in B. Smooth and flavorful and a good eye-opener. (Was worried the name somehow implied less caffeine)Based on our experience in these areas, 5 stars. The "except"? On three seperate occasions out of two boxes purchased seperately, we had "exploding" K-cups! A small pop during brewing that sent coffee grounds spewing over and in the Keurig, counter top, and coffee cup. This at our home brewer AND our vacation house. Messy. Very messy, requiring unplugging and careful cleaning inside cup holder and area. Minus 1 star. Umm, exactly who makes these things and where...hopefully a road bump on the way to sucess. Peace.

review/summary: Outstanding, Bold, Lively Sumatran. best of the K-cups
review/text: First you must know I am one who roasts my own green beans at home, including Sumatran, but also many African varieties. I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine.<br /><br />Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being "tangy" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4.<br />I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy's, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc.<br /><br />Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star. Stale and bitter. I will definitely stay with Puck's.

Nothing exceptional. I prefer a little stronger, bolder coffee, but at this price, it works for me. There's other brands that I like a little better, but with K-cups, cost per unit is always something I have to factor in...<br />I'd buy it again @ $0.38/cup, but I probably wouldn't @ full price. If you keep your eyes peeled, you can always find a good deal... just have to be patient and stock up when the deals arise.
