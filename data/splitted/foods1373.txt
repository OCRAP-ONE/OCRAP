review/summary: BEST GUM EVER!!!!!
review/text: Once you try this gum, there is no turning back! I discovered this gum about 2 years ago and have not bought any other gum since. Try it and you will not be disappointed. My entire circle of family and friends now chew only this gum. The flavor last forever, the consistency stays new and does not get hard or mushy, you can blow bubbles if you like, and it does NOT stick to dental work, or anything else for that matter! There is no need for any other gum other than Ice Cubes, as far as I am concerned. Love this gum!

review/text: I expected gum and that is exactly what I was given.  This gum comes in a the shape of a cube, which despite my misgivings, fit in my mouth hole just fine.  There was a lot of gum in this package so I was also happy with that.  It fit my gum needs for at least a month.

review/text: I am on a diet and needed something suited to substitute the daily "sweets" I yearn for on an everyday basis.  Whenever I am in a mood to munch on a snack, I take one of these gums one of my favorites especially considering I have not been able to find it in any local supermarket or convenience store, and it satisfies my taste buds.  It has no sugar in it either.  Good buy and will last me for another 2 months or so.

review/summary: A little pricy but the best gum around... now
review/text: This is the best gum I've found since Hersey discontinued their Koolerz brand several years ago.  (This stuff is also made by Hersey).<br /><br />Both the Spearmint and Peppermint flavors have a nicely combined minty sweetness that lingers for quite a while.  The texture stays "chewably soft" for even longer.  Another thing I really like about this gum, unlink others I've tried, is it doesn't stick to my fillings or crowns and I don't wind up with little pieces between my teeth.<br /><br />The only problem is the investment to get your first sample.  If you can find it in a store, it's not everywhere, one of these packs costs over a dime a piece.  It can be less, per piece, here but multiple "tubs" (designed to fit in a car cup holder) is a bit if a gamble if you've never tried it.<br /><br />It's great gum and you will probably like it if you like gum.  I was lucky and sat next to a guy in a plane who offered me some.  And, if you should run into me, ask for some because I'll be having some on hand from now on.<br /><br />Please feel free to let Amazon and me know whether this was helpful to you or not, since it helps me improve my reviews.

Gerber has changed their offerings many times over the years giving this particular item ingredient and name changes. My daughter adjusts to the changes, but will prefer this juice over all others. And now when her friends come over, they leave telling their parents, "I love carrot juice!" Unfortunately fewer and fewer stores are caring the item as the Gerber line continues to change and update . I was so glad to find it still available on Amazon. Try it. I think you will be surprised and your own child's response.

It's salty, sweet, and smoky all at once, and the bacon flavor itself comes through very strongly without tasting the least bit fake.  The brown-sugary sweetness surprised me, but it works very well.  A little goes a long way, too - just a few drops add a very pleasant bacon flavor to a cup of coffee.  I'll be buying this again.

review/summary: Works great in morning smoothies!
review/text: I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems. The bag says "keeps best refrigerated or frozen," and I keep it in the refrigerator. I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose! It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix). I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal). The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me. The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky. I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy). Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again. The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake. He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.

The results were encouraging. Participants, drinking the cherry juice, showed significant reductions in known markers of inflammation and lower levels of triglycerides (blood fats) and LDL cholesterol -- both known risk factors for heart disease.<br /><br />Researcher, Dr. Mitch Seymour, who led an animal study at the University of Michigan, in which tart cherries were again found to lower inflammation, said: "Chronic inflammation is a whole body condition that can affect overall health, especially when it comes to the heart. This study offers further promise that foods rich in antioxidants, such as cherries, could potentially reduce inflammation and have the potential to lower disease risk."<br /><br />To start with, tart cherries can aid muscle recovery following exercise. A study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine revealed that strength loss and pain following exercise were significantly less in the cherry juice trial compared to the placebo trial. Most notably, strength loss averaged over the four days after exercise was 22 per cent with the placebo but only 4 per cent with the cherry juice-drinkers.<br /><br />Several earlier studies have confirmed that tart cherries offer benefits for patients with autoimmune, neurodegenerative and connective tissue diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. Studies show that tart cherries not only reduce pain and inflammation but also offer protection against cancer. These effects are attributed to the high amounts of plant phytochemicals, known as anthocyanins, they contain.<br /><br />Research has shown that a diet containing cherries is beneficial in reducing the risk of colon cancer. When researchers fed a diet containing tart cherries, anthocyanins, or cyanidin (a non-sugar breakdown product of anthocyanins) to mice with a genetic susceptibility to colon cancer, the animals developed significantly fewer and smaller colon tumours. This study also revealed that these compounds effectively reduced the growth of two human colon cancer cell lines.<br /><br />The cancer-protective benefits of this fruit were validated in another experimental study, in which cherry fruit extract reduced the growth of both human colon cancer cells and human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent fashion.<br /><br />Researchers have suggested that a possible mechanism by which cherries may confer these benefits is through shutting down the growth of cancer cells by depriving them of the proteins they need to grow.<br /><br />Supporting melatonin levels and brain health<br /><br />Tart cherries are one of the few food sources of melatonin, a chemical released in the body by the pineal gland that is closely connected with the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin also acts as a powerful antioxidant, providing neuro-protective and immune-modulating effects.<br /><br />Ongoing scientific studies are demonstrating how foods naturally rich in melatonin - like Montmorency cherries - can help sufferers of insomnia gain deep, restful sleep.<br /><br />Tart cherries are also rich in phenolic compounds, which have strong neuro-protective activity. In a laboratory setting, cherry phenolics protected neuronal cells from cell-damaging oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. Tart cherry compounds may therefore play an important role in protecting ageing adults against neurodegenerative conditions such as memory loss, senile dementia, and perhaps even Alzheimer's disease.<br /><br />Give it to me!<br /><br />Why do people use tart cherries and tart cherry juice?<br />Both sweet and tart cherries and cherry juice have long been used by traditional healers as a folk remedy for gout, because cherries are thought to lower urate levels in the body.<br /><br />Tart cherries are used for conditions involving inflammation and pain, such as:<br /><br />* arthritis<br />* gout<br />* muscle pain<br />* back pain<br />* diabetes<br />* neurodegenerative diseases<br /><br />Both sweet and tart cherries contain phenolics, naturally-occurring plant compounds that have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant effects.<br /><br />The main type of phenolic in cherries is called anthocyanins. In general, the darker the cherry color, the higher the anthocyanin content.<br /><br />Anthocyanins have been found to block two enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, which play a role in the production of inflammatory compounds called prostaglandins. Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen and ibuprofen also work this way.<br /><br />In test tube studies, cherry anthocyanins have been found to protect neurons from damage by oxidative stress. However, there have been no studies that have looked at whether cherry extracts could prevent or slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease in humans.<br /><br />Both Balaton and Montmorency tart cherries contain relatively high levels of the antioxidant melatonin compared to other foods. Montmorency cherries contain approximately 6 times more melatonin than do Balaton cherries.<br /><br />Are tart cherries more effective than sweet cherries?<br />Generally, tart cherries have been found to have higher concentrations of phenolics and anthocyanins than sweet cherries.<br /><br />Tart cherries are also slightly lower in sugar. Half a cup of sweet cherries contains 9.3 g of sugar and 46 calories, compared to 6.6 g of sugar and 39 calories in tart cherries.<br /><br />However, there is no real evidence that these differences are significant-both types of cherries are very high in anthocyanins compared with other foods.<br /><br />It may be that we are hearing more about the health benefits of tart cherries because of the way they are marketed. In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration sent warning letters to 29 cherry farmers and distributors for positioning tart cherries on their websites as a medicinal food that could possibly help people with gout, arthritis, diabetes, and prevent cancer.<br /><br />What research has been done on tart cherries?<br />Although anthocyanins, which are also found in blueberries and other purplish-red fruits and vegetables, are known to be powerful antioxidants, no studies have looked at whether cherries--tart or sweet--can relieve symptoms of arthritis, gout, or diabetes outside the lab.<br /><br />All studies involving cherries have been very small, so we'll have to wait to see whether tart cherries are beneficial and in what quantities. In the meantime, here are a few of the studies that have been conducted so far:<br /><br />* A small randomized controlled trial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine examined the effectiveness of a tart cherry juice blend in preventing symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage. Fourteen male college students drank 12 fl oz of a cherry juice blend or a placebo, twice per day for eight consecutive days. Strength loss was significantly lower in people taking the cherry juice (4%) compared with the placebo (22%). Pain was also significantly lower in people taking the cherry juice.<br /><br />* Jill M. Tall, Ph.D., research fellow at Johns Hopkins, was the lead researcher of a study that tested the effectiveness of orally administrated anthocyanins from tart cherries on inflammation-induced pain in rats. The results of the study suggested that tart cherry anthocyanins may have a beneficial role in reducing inflammatory pain.<br /><br />* One small study published in the Journal of Nutrition supported the anti-gout effectiveness of cherries. assessed the effects of Bing cherry (a sweet cherry) consumption on healthy women and found that cherry consumption decreased blood urate levels, and there was a marginal decrease in inflammatory markers c-reactive protein and nitric oxide.

This was kinda disappointing for a product coming from Amazon warehouse and will definitely preclude me from ordering again.

review/summary: Super Gummi Cola Bottles....Super Value & Flavor!
review/text: First of all I would like to say that HANDS DOWN, Haribo makes the best Gummi Candies. It's true! If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know, and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!<br /><br />These Haribo Gummi Candy Super Cola Bottles, are just Bursting with Flavor! They are soft and chewy. (But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)! I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in a delicious cola flavor and they are huge pieces of candy!  These are not small like the bears, at all. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a "chocolate-type candy" where you'd have to worry about allergies.<br /><br />They arrived at my home fresh,delicious and full of flavor.  To keep<br />them this way, I put them into two different "freezer type bags" and of course, I kept some out. Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some and that's OK. I bought this HUGE five pound bag!<br /><br />Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price for this is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound! And these are the same exact cola bottles that you get there, without the worry that everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag! That's a big plus for me!<br /><br />I definitely recommend these gummi super cola bottles, they are a sweet<br />and delicious treat and the VALUE is phenomenal! I will definitely be ordering more super cola bottles, plus a few different kinds of other gummis as well.  Simply because, we all have our favorites!

The ones I get are soft, fresh, have more flavor then the exact same ones I can get locally that have sat in a plastic container waiting to be purchased.  I usually split the five pound bags into one pound ziplock bags but if kept from the air they  stay fresh and soft.

review/summary: The ONLY "Super-Sized" Gummi Colas worth buying
review/text: I buy these bags of cola-goodness about 3-4 times a year for my little brother -- these are the same product that he adores when he drives to Disneyland and makes a pit stop at Casa de Fruta. If you're wondering how big a 5-pound bag is, you'd be surprised at the size: since these are the "giant" cola bottles, imagine a grocery-store produce baggie, fully packed and heat-sealed, but "super heavy". This is a nicely textured gummi: not too soft and it has just the right touch of cola flavor.

review/text: These look like gummy candy, but that's where it changes. They are soft and chewy and do not stick to your teeth or pull out your fillings. The flavors are right on to tasting like the real thing. The one down side is the bag is 2.5 oz and has 2.5 servings. It is very hard to not eat the whole bag at one time. That is 200 colories which is less than a high fat candy bar but still if you are watching what you eat..it's 200.

review/summary: Tasty, but needs more mixed berry
review/text: These are a tasty candy. I say "candy" because that's what they are. The first two ingredients are corn syrup and sugar. Don't delude yourself into thinking that these count as a serving of fruit, or in any way provide positive nutritional value beyond the added vitamin C. They are tasty though. I enjoy their strong fruity flavor and their quality of being gummy but not too sticky.<br /><br />I think this assortment should contain more of the "mixed berry" flavor and fewer of the other two flavors (cherry and strawberry). When there's a case of these fruit snacks available for snacking on at my workplace, the mixed berry always disappears long before the other flavors.

review/text: Kellogg's Fruity Snacks variety pack consists of three flavors; cherry, mixed berry and strawberry. We used to have them at work, but they usually went out fast within days. I'm not sure why we no longer have them. They have great taste, don't stick to your teeth unlike similar products like Jelly Belly and the nutrition content is not bad. The sugar content might be a little too high, but each bag has 100% daily value of vitamin C. If you decide to buy, try Costco. The last time I checked, they charged you about $11 for a pack of 36 that has 12 bags of each flavor.

review/text: It's funny that these are called 'snacks' when they are actually candy. I guess 'snack' sounds better for marketing purposes. However, if you're expecting these to fill you up like an actual snack (snack bar or otherwise) you're going to be out of luck. These are just gummy candies labeled as snacks.<br /><br />The best thing about these is that they contain no fat. They are very tasty (and addictive). My favorite flavor is the mixed berry variety which included blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries. None of the flavors are too sweet or too chewy; they have a very pleasing consistency that doesn't stick to your teeth.

review/summary: My most favorite hot sauce........
review/text: If you actually like sauces that have more than just HOT appeal, you will love this one.  Melinda's XXXXTra Reserve is my favorite out of the hundreds I've tried to include some homemade sauce on St. Croix......which runs reeeeeeeally close *smile*<br /><br />Great flavor and bite.......delish!  Also, this seller takes care of their customers :o)  Good all the way around!

review/summary: Among the best hot sauces in the world
review/text: I am a chile head. I eat habanero sauces just about every day; from Dave's, Da Bomb, Z sauce, Iguana, Blair's, El Yucateco, Liquid Stoopid, and many others-it's safe to say I've tried most of what's out there. I looooove Melinda's XXXXtra reserve sauce.<br /><br />Like other reviewers have stated: this is NOT the sauce that will land you in the E.R. This is a sauce that is reasonably hot and packs amazing flavor. It's the flavor of Melinda's that keeps me constantly stocking it in my refrigerator alongside my other hot sauces. Sometimes I want heat that isn't overpowering and this stuff fits the bill. It's delicious on just about anything-I could probably pour a bowl of it and dip tortilla chips-it really is that good! Try it, even if you can handle hotter, you're taste buds will thank you.

review/text: Bought this for my husband who is a major pepper head. I think I ended up eating half of it, and I have no tolerance for heat. Despite the fact that it is NOT very spicy, it has a great taste and we put it on almost everything until the bottle was gone. Still recommend for those who want the flavor over the burn, but will be trying the naga jolokia next.

review/text: Hard to beat the flavor of this stuff, its fresh and clean.<br /><br />Still not going to blow your head off, maybe Melinda needs to come out with<br />a XXXXXXXXXXXtra Hot version of this stuff, but you'll still have a hard time<br />finding any other habanero sauce that tastes better on fish, pork, or chicken.<br /><br />Still not as universal as Tabasco Habanero, but a great complement to veggies<br />and other light dishes, and when you go to Firehouse for a sub you can try this<br />on your smoked turkey and you will be pleasantly amazed at the effect. Great stuff,<br />a staple for any decent collection. BTW, if you like the flavor of this stuff and<br />still crave more heat, check out Iguana Radioactive Atomic Sauce, its got the same<br />basic ingredients as Melinda's, the same consistency, but is about 6X up the heat<br />scale from this relatively weak XXXX sauce. 5 Scovies

review/text: This is hands down the best commercial habanero hot sauce available. When I can find it I order 6 or 8 at a time. The flavor is sublime - real flavor, not just heat. I tend toward spicy foods and this is not hot compared to Dave's Inanity for example, but Inanity has about the flavor of motor oil. I can eat Melinda's off a teaspoon with nothing else - it's that good. Marie Sharp's doesn't even come close.

review/summary: FoodTaster
review/text: When I look for a hot sauce I want something that adds heat.  Plain and simple.  It should not have an overpowering flavor of it's own but simply a pleasant background upon which to serve up the heat.  I use hot sauce to accent the flavors of the food I'm eating with heat.  Amongst the hot sauces on the market any sauce that claims to be XXXX Habanero Hot should provide heat.  This sauce does not do that.  I usually use small drops of hot sauce on my foods.  With this sauce I was able to literally eat it by the tablespoon without a true heat sensation.  I gave it to my 18month old son and he didn't even raise an eyebrow.  No, I am not exaggerating or misusing the word 'literally'.  I put a large dose of this in mac and cheese I was eating and let my youngest have a bite too.  He didn't even seem to notice a difference in taste.<br /><br />If you are like me and want a sauce that can be added sparingly to provide heat without changing or masking the defining flavors of whatever dish you are eating then this sauce is not for you.  It would be impossible to add enough of this sauce to create the desired heat level without burying your food in it.  Since, this sauce straight out of the bottle is on the high end of mild I doubt you could ever add enough.<br /><br />Hot sauces labeled XXXX Habanero Hot should be on the high end of hot.  This sauce is nowhere even close.  It is mislabeled.  If it had been properly labeled I would not have wasted my money on it.  It is one X hot.

It tastes almost sinful, but raw cacao is actually one of nature's best foods.  Can it be?  Can it really be that a choco bar is actually good for you?  I found out that those bad things that are attributed to chocolate such are actually caused by the dairy, sugar and others fillers added to the dark chocolate.

review/summary: GF Spaghetti-O's
review/text: I love this product.  I have tried multiple pastas in my pasta fagioli soup,  this is the best substitute for tubetti. Great in all soups from chicken noodle to vegetable.  Nice texture.<br />BUT WHAT IS REALLY COOL IS USING IT TO MAKE A GLUTEN FREE SPAGHETTI-O'S.  My daughter recently had both a tonsillectomy followed by placement of extensive orthodontia appliances.  So I wondered if it would work for a GF spag-O.  It was a huge hit, will definitely use for school lunches.  Place in boiling water, stir frequently (to get through the sticky/clumping phase), return to boil, boil for a few minutes then turn to low to medium heat and allow water to cook down (just like many brands of mac & cheese).  Then add spaghetti sauce.  It is always great to duplicate something that other kids can eat.

review/summary: Gluten Free SpaghettiOs
review/text: We use these for gluten free SpaghettiOs too.  But for the sauce we use...<br /><br />1 can Tomato Sauce<br />2 Tbsp Cheese Whiz<br />1 pinch Sugar (for some reason it just smoothes out the taste)<br /><br />Stir while heating to melt and mix the cheese whiz in until smooth.  If it starts to look thick add in a little water. Then gently add in about a cup, (more or less to taste), of cooked noodles.  Continue to heat just until warm again and serve.<br /><br />Another great use for these is as a light and refreshing alternative in your favorite tuna salad recipe.  It is our favorite Sabbath Salad recipe and when we took it to a buffet party, everyone asked where to find these noodles.  :o)  (No one realized they were gluten free).

It's two of John Candy's favorite things wrapped into one - bacon and salt.<br /><br />I am one for combining things that make sense.  Shampoo and conditioner.  Peanut butter and jelly.  Paris Hilton and an electric chair.  Bacon and...well, anything.  I can put bacon with any dish and it'll taste great.  Eggs, salads, steaks, macaroni, etc.  Now, I just put a little of this Bacon Salt on whatever I'm eating, and it tastes like a million bucks.<br /><br />I'm not one to look at the back of the bottle, so you'll have to go elsewhere for the health exploits of the product (however, as far as I know, it's low on sodium).  For the taste, however - you can't go wrong, as long as you like BACON.<br /><br />RATING - BUY...NOW.

review/text: Those of us who must limit sodium intake tend to be desperate for palatable low-sodium seasonings and grateful when we find them. BaconSalt has leapt way beyond merely "palatable," however, and brought new seasoning products to market that can make salt-hungry, bacon-deprived deprived folk like us absolutely giggle with delight. When we first learned about BaconSalt, we bought one of each flavor (the basics on Amazon, some special ones on the company website), plus extras for gifts. We sent a half-price gift package to loved ones at an APO address (as of this writing, the company actually gives military buyers/recipients a 50% discount -- imagine that!). We have no interest in the company, BTW ... we're just happy consumers grateful to find that we needn't abandon the savory flavors of bacon in the pursuit of good health.

review/text: I originally bought one bottle of the Bacon Salt as a Christmas present for my husband. We decided to put it on Kraft Macaroni and Cheese as a taste test.<br /><br />One bite and we knew we had to buy more.  One bottle was not going to be sufficient.<br /><br />This stuff is good on pretty much anything, though so far, the macaroni and cheese is the best flavor combination.  I can also confirm that it is excellent on baked potatoes, pizza and veggie burgers.<br /><br />It gets bonus points from me because I'm sensitive to greasy foods, so I don't get to eat a lot of real bacon.  The only disappointing part is that our local grocery store doesn't carry it -- they only sell Baconnaise (which I've yet to try).  Thankfully, Amazon's great deals save the day!

review/text: "Everything should taste like bacon," and with Bacon Salt, everything can. J & D's, obsessed with baconizing everything from popcorn to ranch dressing to lip balm, really hooked me with Bacon Salt. This seasoning works on hamburgers, mashed potatoes, popcorn, scrambled eggs, cheeseburger quiche...basically anything I usually sprinkle with salt, I have used Bacon Salt, and it always enhances the taste with the bacon flavoring.<br /><br />Original Bacon Salt contains 135mg of sodium per 1/4 teaspoon, has no calories, and is safe for those on vegetarian or kosher diets. There are other Bacon Salt alternatives, from Mesquite to Jalapeno to Hickory to Applewood, each with a slightly different sodium content.<br /><br />Bacon Salt is a great addition to the spice rack, and adds a different dimension to favorite meals.

review/summary: Perfect Dry Rub
review/text: This past weekend I found myself working the grill with some friends and their families.  One of our concoctions was a bacon wrapped pork loin and the other (second, lesser, afterthought) was a bacon salt rubbed flat iron steak.  Libations were flowing and by the time it came to prepare the steak, a generous amount of J&D's Original Bacon Salt was applied to both sides of the flat iron steak.  Now I've done dry rubs with grilled and smoked meats before, but I've usually concocted my own rubs, specifically concerned with things like salt and mono-sodium glutamate levels, etc.  After applying the rub, I had an "oh shoot" moment as I thought, this isn't one of my recipes, this is from a jar,... what if it totally sucks?  What if it is way too salty?  Now remember, the tenderloin was the main event, the bacon salt rubbed flat iron steak was the teaser.<br /><br />So both cuts of meat were thrown on the grill at around the same time, knowing full well the flat iron would come off first.  We pulled the flat iron off at around medium and let it rest.  Patience grew thin and we decided to give it a shot.  The flavoring from the rub was sublime and far better than ever expected.  This rub is truly low sodium and was surprisingly delicious.  The flat iron steak disappeared within minutes with the help of both adults and teenage children.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, the bacon wrapped pork loin was still the main event, but the bacon salt rubbed flat iron steak was definitely regarded as an equal and not an afterthought or teaser.  It was enjoyed equally.<br /><br />J&D's Original Bacon salt comes highly recommended.

If you have a glass mug drizzle chocolate syrup down the inside of the mug and make it look really fancy!

review/text: I love my morning coffee, so I bought a Dolce Gusto machine (on sale for only $20 which is a fraction of the retail cost)to try and curb the cost of lattes every morning. Not to mention, having to rush to work if the line at the coffee shop is long or service is slow etc etc.  Much to my dismay, I discover that I can only buy the coffee pods online. I thought for sure I could find them wherever Krups was sold, but, no dice! What is up with that???<br />So, I suck it up and place an order through Amazon for the Dolce Mocha. Wow!!! I am really shocked at how disgusting this flavor is. The hot chocolate from the gas station tastes better. This tastes cheap, and there was no element of coffee flavor to it at all. If you are a coffee lover, skip this flavor.  If you have a pallet for cheap tasting hot coco powder, then by all means, order this!<br /><br />I haven't tried any other flavors for the Dole Gusto yet, but if they are anything like this, then my attempt at saving a bit of money and time every morning seems to be in vain. Perhaps this is why the machine was so cheap huh? I am hoping the other flavors are not as disappointing as the Mocha flavor.  Yuck.

review/summary: Worth it !
review/text: There's a review here and the review basically sez "Not worth the higher cost". Au contraire, mon frere ! I happend upon this review because I came to Amazon to stock up. I love these PARTICULAR grahams above all others I have ever tried and I have tried quite a few kinds. They are not too sweet, nor are they not sweet enough. Texture-wise they are far superior to Nabisco's cardboard version. And they have an excellent (like no other) taste of high quality vanilla. If these cost more then generic house brands it's I premium I'm willing to pay. I buy them so often, I decided to try Amazon's Subscribe and Save which prices them comparable to what I pay at my local grocery. The thing that remains to be seen is 1, Will they be fresh ? (Amazon grocery stuff is notorious for being at or near the expiration date - we'll see and 2, Will the good folks at UPS turn these into pie crust and ice cream topping ? I'll try to remember to report back. The 5 stars are for the Grahams themselves. They are THE BEST and they are worth the rather slight premium - absolutely worth the difference.

review/summary: Those little elves are...
review/text: Living like trillionaires, for what the high cost of Keeblers is. I found that the taste was a bit better than the store brand and there is no question to that, but the cost is just not worth the small difference.<br /><br />I wouldnt suggest a hit and run over one elve,  may decrease the cost as there productivity should go up with fewer working elves.You know like the rest of us in this country, that need to work ten times as hard, to just make ends meet.

review/summary: Best whole food energy source around
review/text: I have tried several different brewers yeasts and this is by far the best of them ALL! I use this to make a whole food source of all those great energy giving B vitamins. I put 2 heaping tablespoons of the brewers yeast in the blender with 1 tablespoon blackstrap molasses and 1/2 cup of any milk of your choice. Blend really well and this gives me incredible energy. Better than coffee by far. I have 4 children and believe me I couldn't do it without this product.

review/summary: Sweet, Creamy Chai
review/text: I'm really fond of this chai. I like a lot of chais, but this one is unique with the blend of red and decaf black tea, sweetened with coconut. It forgives a long steep or a wide range of temperatures (though hotter temps bring out better flavor), and I find the blend of flavors quite nice, particularly for such an inexpensive brand of tea.<br /><br />As with most chais, this tea is not at all bitter.
