The presentation tin is very pretty and the product, mixed with milk is a treat.  Not sure if a bottle of wine is an appropriate gift? this will work - just wish it wasn't so hard to find!

review/summary: Unexpected combination is FANTASTIC!
review/text: Faerie's Finest Vanilla Sea Salt was a recent birthday gift.  Since I opened it (the version I have came in a refillable grinder) I have been grinding Vanilla Sea Salt on everything.<br /><br />As one is grinding the salt, the smell of vanilla drifts up and is quite soothing and intriguing.  The flavor, once incorporated into food, is very mild.  It is not a "dessert"-y vanilla flavor, due to the sea salt, but when sampled in a bowl of hearty turkish chicken-lemon-egg-rice soup the vanilla smoothed out the lemon flavor a bit- made it almost silky and buttery rather than tart (I put in a little too much lemon this go around)... I had filet mignon and sprinkled a little of the vanilla sea salt on the filet and I think that vanilla sea salt was made for this purpose... Absolute perfection!<br /><br />Fantastic blend, fantastic packaging.  I'm one happy salt fanatic!

review/summary: The British really eat this stuff?
review/text: A friend of mine told me about Marmite and how it's chalk full of vitamins and such and that the British eat this stuff on toast with their breakfast.  So being somewhat adventurous when it comes to food, I thought I'd give it a try.  I read a bunch of other reviews on here both good and bad so I felt I was properly prepared for what I was facing.  I ordered it and it arrived very quickly in a larger box than I was expecting and it was bubble wrapped to the hilt!  Peeling off layer after layer (after layer, after layer) I finally got down to the center . . . and I started to think this was a joke!  It's an incredibly tiny container!<br /><br />So I had read that this is some powerful stuff, so I open it up and just dab my pinky in it for a quick taste.  WOW, that is some strong stuff!!  Those other reviews weren't kidding!!!  It's also kind of sticky, like a consistency that reminds me of honey (so be careful what it touches, because it's likely to remain there).  So the next morning I make some toast and LIGHTLY spread some Marmite on there and tried it . . . still strong, so I put butter on there as well.  Not bad but the strong, salty taste of the Marmite definitely hangs on.  On another piece of toast I again put a light amount of Marmite on there and then covered it with honey . . . not bad with the combo of salt and sweet.<br /><br />I've done this for a couple of weeks now, and I can see why the container is so small.  Using small amounts it hardly looks like I've made a dent in it at all.  I can't say I'm a big fan, but it's definitely an acquired taste that I'm not sure I'll acquire by the time I finish the tiny container off!

review/text: I love this stuff. It takes a bit of practice to get it right, but I mix it with cream cheese and spread it on bagels in the morning. Yum! I don't know why it is so sticky though. You have to be careful with the lid because if you close it too tight you will have a time getting it open again. The stickiness just freezes that lid shut no matter how careful I am. I have found that running under warm water does the trick to open it again. I love my Marmite. The taste is about the same as the more expensive and famous Vegemite. Enjoy!

review/text: As an American, I don't ever see this kind of product at home. I received a small jar of Marmite and was apprehensive about the flavor. It has a strong nutty flavor that is not unpleasant but I'm not sure how I'll be eating it. I guess I can put it on toasted bread at first and experiment with other stuff. It doesn't taste bad, just different.

review/summary: Strange
review/text: Okay, I read the reviews. And I asked my British friends what Marmite was like. Nothing gave me a clear enough idea, though, so I ordered some from Amazon and tried it myself.<br /><br />The verdict's still out. I neither hate nor love, much less like nor dislike, Marmite. I've tried it on plain toast, and I've eaten it on toast topped with eggs. The taste is a bit bitter, like the toast is slightly burned. That would normally be a turnoff, but Marmite is very salty, and that takes the edge off the bitterness.<br /><br />It's nutritious. You can smell B vitamins when you first open the jar. But I'm not sure the sodium content makes that a point in its favor.<br /><br />I'll probably finish the jar and forget all about Marmite. It's that underwhelming.

review/text: It seems like the three legumes all sprout and grow at different rates so the texture is a bit uneven.  Also, the peas and garbanzos are such large seeds that they take a long time to use up their stored energy.  You are either eating a lot of seed or you are eating overgrown sprouts.  I'd stick to the lentils on their own or to the always classic mung.

review/summary: Easy and delicious
review/text: I bought my Todd's Seeds mix from Buy Wholesale Cheap.  It was packaged in a simple plastic bag enclosed with tape.  It was in a thick plastic bag so there was no spillage.  I used the Easy Sprout and it was super easy to sprout this mix.  Soak the legumes for 8 - 12 hours, pour out the water and rinse, shake out all of the excess water, nest the inner cup with the rinsed legumes back into the outer cup and put back on the Easy Sprout dome lid.  Repeat every 12 hours.  All sprouted by 36 hours into the process.  I taste-tested the legumes every 12 hours.  The garbanzo and lentils were always tasty (nutty with a vegetal flavor).  The green peas were bitter until the roots sprouted at around 36 hours.  Then, it was more tasty without any bitterness.<br /><br />Since I only have one Easy Sprout which I usually use for salad sprouts (Broccoli & Friends), I only used the Easy Sprout part of the time.  After about 24 hours, I moved the legumes to a quart mason jar and used the screen of a wire colander to drain out the rinsing water.  I then just left the mason jar (with the legumes inside) on its side and put it on a large plate.  It worked just as well.<br /><br />Unlike the salad sprouts which you only need about 3 tablespoons of seed to get a full container of sprouts, the legumes only expand about double the size so I would recommend using about 1 - 1 1/2 cups of legumes for a full container of sprouted legumes.

review/summary: Great sprouts, lousy packaging!
review/text: Still 5 stars, since the sprouts were some of the best I've tasted!  However, the seeds come in a ziplock baggie, in a cardboard frame made for a book.  The bottom of the baggie came open in shipment and loose seeds rolled around the box, spilling out of the sides.  However, I think I received almost the all of the seeds, and I just transferred them to a new ziplock baggie.<br /><br />The dry seeds are smaller and muted in color, but the instructions say to soak them overnight before putting them into whatever sprouter you're using.  The seeds grew in size and gained in color, and then were fascinating to watch sprout.  To add to the experience, the resulting sprouts had a nutty taste and texture to them.  I grew these sprouts in a 3-shelf grower, with other "flavors" in the other shelves, and these were clearly the best-tasting of the 3.

I only give them 4 stars because 1 lb does not last long, and I personally did not find these nearly as tasty as seed sprouts.<br /><br />I would recommend that readers be very careful about the reviews they read because I don't believe the products are the same from different sellers.  In a separate purchase, I was shockingly dissatisfied with a purchase from Buy Wholesale Cheap whose seeds came packaged in a ZipLoc bag which leaked seeds all over.

review/summary: Amazingly creamy!
review/text: Let me begin by saying that I've read all the reviews for this matcha, and although it sounds delicious, I never thought Bavarian Cream would be a flavour I crave. I love donuts with fillings, don't get me wrong, but they aren't something I jones for in the middle of the night. (I haven't been pregnant yet, so that could change! Haha). I guess what I'm trying to say is - I already have the Cheesecake Matcha, how amazing could Bavarian Cream be?<br /><br />The answer? Extremely amazing. Absolutely amazing. Exclaim it to the heavens!<br /><br />There's something about this flavour that took me by surprise and wooed me. The smell is sweet and creamy, no mistaking it for "vanilla" or something generic, it's quite a specific scent. The aroma is true to the taste, hallelujah! There's almost a "thickness" to it, and certainly a richness, that is reminiscent of its namesake. Creamy creamy creamy! The smell and taste of biting into that perfect area of donut where all the cream is. I personally like to save that part for the last, if I'm lucky. ;)<br /><br />Thankfully with this matcha, I get the best part all to myself!<br /><br />My personal favourite way to enjoy this matcha is as a hot latte with a pinch of sugar, to make the flavour pop and enhance the cream (if it can get any creamier - my goodness!). That said, I also shook it up in a water bottle and took it to work as an iced tea and again it really surprised me! No sugar added + true Bavarian Cream flavour = a happy Ash-Lee servicing customers with a buzz! Thanks Red Leaf Tea!

review/text: This matcha is great hot or cold. I think it tastes more like vanilla custard as a hot latte, and more like the whipped filling of a pastry when cold. Definitely great with milk! It also makes a great flavor for mixing with others. Peaches and cream, anyone? But even by itself, it's fantastic and definitely a must re-purchase when I run out.

Vanilla, Cream, Butter. Those were the aromas that struck me.<br /><br />It is a pleasing flavor if you like rich, and creamy with a full lingering after taste!<br /><br />It tastes exactly like what you get in the middle of a doughnut! Oh yes...its good! :)<br /><br />This is on the top of my list of favorites from Red Leaf Tea but I dare you to make a list of only 5 or even 10 as they are all so very good!<br /><br />They taste exactly like what they say they will!<br /><br />Impressed as always!

review/text: I love Bavarian cream, it's such a nice luscious flavor. Though a big part of the reason I like it is the texture--and surely, a matcha couldn't really capture that, right? Well once again Red Leaf proves that they cam turn ANY flavor into a matcha and make it work! This is creamy, dreamy, vanilla custard with of course a lovely hint of grassy green matcha in the background. But the feel is smooth, creamy, and luscious. It really is like Bavarian Cream in a cup! It's got that same smooth custard-like texture as their Cheesecake Matcha, but I think Bavarian Cream edges it out a bit in terms of my favorites. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Sweet and Decadent!
review/text: I have wanted to order a vanilla-y Matcha for a while now, and I was debating back and forth between choosing the French Vanilla and the Madagascar Vanilla, when I finally settled on trying the Bavarian Cream.  And while this probably isn't as strongly VANILLA as the other two might be (but I don't know that for sure because I haven't yet tried either one of them, but they're on my list to eventually try too!) this one takes creaminess to a whole other level.<br /><br />I mean, you get the creaminess from the Matcha too, and combine that with the custard-y creamy taste of the Bavarian Cream, along with good amount of vanilla flavor and OMG you have heaven in a tea bowl.<br /><br />So very good.  Luscious, creamy, sweet and decadent.  Perfect!

review/summary: A yummy treat without the hassle
review/text: I admit that my knowledge of Bavarian Cream is limited. I originally thought it was just a variation of vanilla. But apparently, it's more like a custard and quite popular in pastries. I personally try to avoid pastries since they are delicious but can also be calorie-laden and full of sugar. So it's nice when you can have a matcha instead that has the flavor without all the calories. Also, Bavarian cream seems like a hassle to make, so all the more reason to enjoy it in matcha form.<br /><br />I actually made this matcha iced and found it absolutely delicious. Normally I have to toss some milk in there to make it a little more drinkable, but this didn't need anything at all. The taste was very creamy and I could just detect the tiny bit of citrus. It's worth noting that if you do decide to chill your matcha this way, a lot of the powder sinks to the bottom, so you may have to froth it up again to get it to absorb.

It's energizing and delicious. I definitely taste the vanilla and cream, and I guess that's what Bavarian cream is, right? It's a very custardy flavor. And then I get some matcha flavor in the background. It's divine. I am in cream puff heaven...

review/summary: delicious taste with deceptive marketing/nutrition claims
review/text: I loved the taste of these, which is what earned it the high marks (dark chocolate was by far the best, although I've tried some other flavors and enjoyed them somewhat, with the exception of white chocolate).  They're a great snack, rather filling and high in protein, although they're a bit smaller than what I'd like. Nevertheless, I wish they didn't advertise its health benefits so much and so deceptively--maltitol also increases blood glucose and is somewhat absorbed, so it is not really a free carbohydrate.  "Sugar-free" is just confusing.  They should consider sweetening it with sucralose and stop making a big deal about its "natural" qualities--who here thinks that packaged snack bars with a dozen ingredients are "natural" anyway?  At the end of the day, I can occasionally tolerate their high price and their ridiculous claims because it just tastes good.

review/summary: Surprised to LOVE IT!!!  Tastes really good.
review/text: Okay so I ordered every flavor of these during the summer sale in June were most of the flavors $12, and if you signed up "Subscribe and Save" they were $10.50 each.  So, I will be putting up reviews as I open each box.  They have been in the fridge (keeps me from random snacking) and I opened Dark Chocolate, Chocolate Mudslide, and Mixed Nuts & White Chocolate last night.  I am 5'3" and 118 and I try to add some protein to my diet with bars like this.  My review will only be for the Dark Chocolate (others on the appropriate product pages.)  I will start with what EVERYONE really cares about: TASTE!  These bar tasted incredible to me!!!! Thick, rich, dark chocolate, chewy consistency, NO chemical taste, sweet but not too sweet. I read the nutrient profile and the ingredient list, and I am really pleased with the ingredient quality.  This is what attracted me to the product.  It is sugar free, gluten free, and wheat free.  This is great for those watching their waistline.  On the other hand, it has a pretty sizeable fat content.  This one has 7 grams of fat.  So just be aware of that when including in your diet, too many of these and you WILL gain weight!  The protein is excellent!!! (20 grams), as much as a small chicken breast.  (Although chicken breast doesn't have this much fat.)  The sodium isn't bad (125 mg).  There are 14 net carbs, which subtract out the fiber and sugar alcohols (the sugar alcohols are in debate as to whether your body burns them as calories or not.)  The calories, fat, protein, and carbs are equal to: a large plain green salad, 3 oz chicken breast, 3 cups broccoli, 1/2 tablespoon oil, and a cup of berries.  So I say that to illustrate that this is definitely a healthy MEAL REPLACEMENT for those on the go and really has TOO MANY calories for a full bar to be a snack.  If you plan on snacking, break it in half and eat half for an afternoon snack, and half for a nighttime snack.  If you do it this way, these bars are actually a very smart, thoughtfully balanced, and highly convenient, delicious snack.  That is the most effective way to use these bars.  They do not really have enough fiber to eat as a meal replacement because you will be hungry in less than four hours after eating.  If you do use as a meal replacement, add a broth soup and a large green salad with low-cal dressing, or veggies (most grocery stores sell washed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots that you can eat on the go.)  Another way to incorporate these DELICIOUS bars into your routine is a breakfast.  Perfect for on the go and it's hard to eat more before lunch even if you do get hungry (which most people don't get very hungry before lunch.)  So in summary: EXCELLENT ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS; DELICIOUS, DECADENT FLAVOR (as good as a candy bar); CONVENIENT PACKAGING; GREAT VITAMIN & MINERAL PROFILE (you'll still need a comprehensive multivitamin daily); CONVENIENT SOURCE OF PROTEIN; GREAT SNACK (if you eat half as a snack or the other half later in the day as a snack.)  THE PRICE IS RIGHT too based on Amazon's deal vs. in store pricing on these bars.  They are very expensive in retail stores, Amazon is selling them almost 50% off.  Helpful hint: if you sign up for Subscribe & Save, you get the best price.  You can set your shipments to every six months, and even if you don't want them then, you can delay shipment.  The point is, you really never have to buy more later in order to get the best price now.  You can keep deferring shipment.  Not saying that to scam Amazon, just saying that may help more people be willing to try a delicious bar if the price is right.  I hope this review helped you make a purchasing decision, either for or against the product.  I know I hate to waste my money, and I wanted to give a honest review.

review/text: While I love the Think Thin brand, the taste of these bars is the worst of the entire brand. While others might like the taste of the Dark Chocolate bars, I'm sorry I had to go through an entire box of 12. Try either of the Peanut Butter types or even the Cookies and Cream bites.

review/summary: This is DarK Chocolate?
review/text: I was somewhat disappointed with this item. I expected it to be more chocolate-y. The outside coating is the usual dark chocolate coating that thinkThin uses on its other bars. The problem was that the interior detracted from the intense chocolate taste that I expected. It was muddled and weak. With this warning in mind, I have to say that it's better than other bars that I've tried from other companies. So, I don't want to discourage people from trying them. I'm a real chocolate person and I want an intense chocolate taste.

review/summary: Normally good, risky to buy on Amazon
review/text: I've purchased these in the grocery store, and they're (in my opinion) the best flavor of all the ThinkThin bars. They have a slight dark chocolate taste and a few little crispies inside...overall not too chalky for a protein bar. 20 grams of protein with only 230 calories is great! Unfortunately, when I purchased a box off Amazon, they arrived and all of the crispies inside were no longer crispy. Perhaps they'd been sitting in the warehouse too long, but I would exercise caution when purchasing these online.

review/summary: thinkAddiction
review/text: While I wish thinkThin would produce bars lower in carbs, since "diabetic friendly" is one of their claims, I continue to enjoy them.<br />These definitely have a synthetic-healthy chocolate taste to them but are still good. The dark chocolate has a deepness to it and is sweeter than I expected. This is similar to the Brownie Crunch which is my favorite. Every time I try a new thinkThin flavor I find the taste to be okay then I don't really think about it, the next day I decide to have another one and it doesn't taste any better but I enjoy it more. The flavor is good, better than some nutritional bars. The dense texture makes me feel like I'm eating something more substantial than a meal replacement bar and I just keep coming back.<br />Lately I've been cutting these in half and throwing them in the fridge or freezer and enjoying a nice cold 100 calorie snack.

review/text: I am not usually a fan of dark chocolate therefore I usually only buy thinkThin white chocolate bars at a local Wholefoods.  But I decided to try this dark chocolate version because of the excellent deal on them and I was pleasantly surprised by how yummy these are.<br /><br />Taste is so subjective but to me the taste of these bars are not overwhelmingly dark and there seems to be a hint of coconut to them although I am not sure there is actually coconut is in these bars.<br /><br />We like to keep them in the fridge...and they are a perfect on the run pick me up..

review/summary: Excellent for my specific needs
review/text: Highly recommended.<br />Very good taste for a healthy snack; I had low expectations. My biggest fear is not the total number of calories, but mostly the carbs. The dark chocolate chunks tasted good, but again, I am not eating this for taste.<br />Just to confirm how effective a low sugar diet (a la Primal, thanks to Mark Sisson) can be; I was travelling and I eat these bars as a meal replacement every single day, and at the end I lost a few pounds. You can quickly deduct from the other reviews that the majority liked these bars and a small minority wasn't impressed; I suggest you try 1 or 2 before making the plunge. I need to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GOT50Q">Doctor's CarbRite Diet Sugar Free Bar, Dark Chocolate, 3-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/text: These bars are shipped via the U.S. Post Office. When I buy them in a store such as Whole Foods, they are fresh and the outer coatings intact. When I bought them through Amazon, the outer coatings were melted and in some cases stuck to the inside of the wrappers. It is not a case where they were left in a mailbox all day. My mailman handed them to me, along with the other mail. Don't buy this product from Amazon, pay a little more and get a good product.

review/summary: Not What I Expected
review/text: I don't know why, but I thought this was some kind of healthy chocolate, but in reality it's more of a type of brownie bar, like a dense brownie bar with little flavor.  That being said, I'd choose this over many of the other so called healthy snack bars that are loaded with corn syrup and other not so good for you chemicals.  The taste is decent, not great but not as bad as others I have tried.

review/summary: Don't buy in summer!
review/text: I like the taste, but don't buy this expecting a candy bar. It's really not sweet at all, but I still like it. The diet food claims are pretty ridiculous, this small bar has 230 calories and is a meal replacement, not a diet snack. The product loses a star for false claims.<br /><br />It tastes good, is a convenient meal replacement, and a reasonable price when bought on amazon with subscribe and save.<br /><br />Don't buy it in summer! I bought this a month or so ago and it arrived all melted. When it hardened, the chocolate was all over the inside of the packaging and it was a big mess. I'll have to wait until fall to order these again.

I have never posted a review until now.  I had a subscription for the Think Thin Chocolate brownie crunch bar until Amazon lost that account for whatever reason.  I switched over to a subscription for the dark chocolate bar...I just ate it (had to force myself to finish it). It tastes SOOOOOO bad and leaves a chemical after-taste.  I don't know how anyone can think this tastes good???? I am now stuck with three boxes of this junk that my dogs don't even want to eat.  I just canceled my subscription and will now have to trek to Trader Joes to get my chocolate brownie crunch bars!

Maltitol is a sugar which is identical in properties to sucrose (table sugar).  The only difference is that Maltitol is only about 80% as sweet as sucrose.  No matter how they are marketing this thing, it is a candy bar.

review/summary: Medium Sized Treat, Big Yummy Taste
review/text: Milkbone Original Crunchy Treats / B000EBKSCU<br /><br />My puppy just loves these Milkbone treats. Though the box says "Great for Training", they are a bit too big for proper treat training (which involves slicing the treats very thinly so that the dog doesn't get satiated or fattened up) because the treats are very hard and cannot be easily sliced into smaller pieces.<br /><br />However, they are uniquely good for training "Leave It!" - I can drop it on the floor and the puppy immediately notices the smell and comes over to investigate. And if he decides to ignore my "Leave It!" command, the treat is big enough and hard enough that it survives in his mouth long enough for my to reach in and grab it and start over - no rewards for ignoring "Leave It!", or he'll ignore it always. After only a few weeks of training, "Leave It!" is well-understood and almost always obeyed, thanks to these yummy Milkbones.<br /><br />Also, since these are larger and more satisfying that his usual treats, he also gets these at crate time. When Mommy says "Crate!" that means he snuggles into his crate and waits anxiously for his Milkbone treats. He absolutely adores them, and loves gobbling them up happily.<br /><br />These came carefully packed from Amazon with no shipping problems. The bulk price on Amazon is much cheaper than anything I've found locally and much more convenient.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/text: These are nice, small treats that my dog enjoys very much. Only reason that it gets 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the "great for training" call on the box. As one reviewer already said, these really aren't very good for training. They are too big to work well - the dog looses focus and they are too crunch to cut up and use in smaller bits. However, with that being said, my dog loves these! I'll continue to pick them up as general treats or as a big treat at the end of a training session.

review/text: I've never found a dog biscuit my little Maltese likes so I knew I was taking a chance. Still,  I'm VERY disappointed that there are no returns for the 11 unopened boxes.  I wouldn't try them if you have a finicky dog or a small eater. They are bland. There's no tasty smell, I mean nothing. The cardboard box smells as appetizing. I realize my dog is hard to please so I won't blame it all on MilkBone. He's not a big eater and has never been a chewer (never chewed on furniture, shoes etc) so although he won't grab ANY bone, he does enjoy them. Most beef bones are too large but he crunches lamb or pork rib bones up completely.  There must be SOME kind of biscuit to keep a small eater's teeth healthy.

review/text: Perhaps it's because I live in northern Canada (although that shouldn't be an excuse), but it took a few days for the product to be shipped.  Once, however, it was, it arrive on the last day of the projected delivery day.<br /><br />No complaints.

review/summary: Great info but a bit dated.
review/text: I spent a week at Playa Guiones and my review is based my limited time and location visited.  My review is specific to that area.<br /><br />I would have given this book a 5-star rating if it was more up to date.  It was written about 10 years ago and much has changed since then.  Although a few places have gone out of business, there are now more choices for lodging, food, etc.  Overall the area has become more developed.
