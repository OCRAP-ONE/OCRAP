review/summary: Made in China. FDA says contaminated!!
review/text: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR ANY CHICKEN JERKY TREAT PRODUCT FROM CANYON CREEK RANCH OR ANY OTHER DISTRIBUTOR OF PRODUCTS FROM CHINA UNTIL THE FDA ADVISES THE PRODUCTS ARE SAFE AGAIN. Last month the FDA issued a warning advising people not to buy chicken jerky treats made in China [...]. Unfortunately I didn't hear of the warning until it was too late. I gave both my dogs one Yam-Good each for about a month and the result was they almost died from vomiting and bloody stool. Despite their American sounding name, Canyon Creek Ranch IS MADE IN CHINA AND SAYS SO ON THE PACKAGE. Even worse, no where on their website or on Amazon does it mention the FDA warning or that the product is toxic. These lovely little treats nearly cost me the lives of both my dogs, as well as over $500 in vet bills and time off of work.

review/summary: Customer Beware
review/text: Customer beware of VitaPlus, Canyon Creek, & waggin Train products, because of many reports in U.S., Canada, & Australia, that dogs are getting sick from these products made in China.  This is especially so in smaller breeds.  Do your research on these products and then make informed decision on whether you really want to fed your pet these foods.  I threw out all these products, and now I buy only made in the USA.  You have to really look at packaging, as Canyon Creek says No. Carolina on back right side and then on left back side it says made in China.

review/summary: Beware
review/text: In February 2012, I bought these treats while traveling for my 10lbs dog.  I chose them because they seemed fairly healthy, and all of the ingredients were something easily recognizable.  After a week of giving him these (following the feeding instructions), he got violently ill.  He went outside to potty and collapsed on the deck on the way back into the house.  He deficated while lying on his side.  I called him to me, he got up and slowly made his way to me before falling over again.  When I picked him up, his head was lolling from side to side and he couldn't keep his eyes open.  I went to grab my shoes and purse while my mom looked up the closest emergency vet.  That's when he began vomiting.<br /><br />By the time we were seen at the vet hospital, his vitals were retuning to normal.  I explained what had happened and they said he'd probably had a seizure.  After checking him out, they said that he seemed fine, but asked what he'd been eating, was it possible that he'd gotten into a pesticide, etc.  At the time, I couldn't think of anything.  When we retuned from our trip, I took him to our regular vet and they did a work up on him.  They didn't find anything.  A couple of weeks later I was watching the news, and when they mentioned that the next story was about dog treats making pets sick, I knew.  I didn't immediately remember the brand name, but after looking up the type and look of the package, I knew it was Canyon Creek Ranch Chicken Yam Good.  To confirm, I called my mom and made her pull out the package.  I was right.  These treats we're the ONLY thing different in his diet.<br /><br />I am thankful that he only had an acute attack from these and not something chronic or worse.  I am going to write a letter to the Neslte pet division, to their CEO, CFO, board of directors, anyone, to let them know that they are making pets sick and worse.  They should be ashamed of themselves

review/summary: Dust from heaven.
review/text: I first came across the seasoning mixture known as Scichimi Togarashi where it was used as a condiment at a Japanese fast food chain in Southern California.<br /><br />It manages through a wonderful synergy of ingredients to be a flavor enhancing medium of addictive power.  I use it primarily on Asian foods, and even on plain rice.<br /><br />It has a spicy bite when applied moderately and really heightens the taste experience when used on meaty dishes, or vegetables such as onion which are already not shy foods.<br /><br />The mixture is available in Asian markets but intrigued by the description provided by See-Smell-Taste I tried their somewhat pricier version.  It was like night vs day, perhaps because theirs was fresher or not mass produced.<br /><br />I will be trying other products from this seller along with regularly having more precious tins of Scichimi Togarashi sent my way.

review/summary: I'm a convert...no more Cheetos for me!
review/text: I tried these on a whim after hearing about Veggie Booty for a long time.  I knew I wasn't ready for VB, but I could certainly try out a new kind of cheese puff.  I previously thought that a day without Cheetos was a day wasted, so this was a big change.<br /><br />These are the best things ever!  They taste like real cheese and there's some variation in the intensity of the flavor - every single one doesn't taste exactly the same.  They aren't as crunchy as Cheetos and don't turn your fingers orange!<br /><br />After trying a couple bags purchased at the grocery store, I decided I loved them enough to invest in this 12-pack from Amazon.  Okay, so maybe I went a little wild and had a bag (or two) a day until they were gone - don't judge me!<br /><br />Try these out!  Buy a bag at the grocery store and then get the 12-pack.  You'll be very happy that you did!

review/text: I found these at my local Trader Joe's grocery store and I've been a fan ever since.  Pirate's Booty makes a healthy and satisfying alternative to run-of-the-mill deep fried potato or corn chips.  As a snack, they leave you with a full but not heavy feeling.  The danger is that they're so good, it's easy to eat the whole bag without realizing it.  I'd recommend taking a few out of the bag at a time and putting the rest out of sight.  Other than that, I can't recommend them enough.

review/text: We ordered a case, and it arrived in perfect condition, i.e., we did not have a problem with open bags/stale contents as some previous reviewers have had.  This is a better alternative to cheetos or other junk food, but I would not condsider it healthy--just a better-tasting, more natural junk food.  It is satisfying and, based on the ingredients and taste, I'd rather eat Pirate's Booty than cheetos.  I subsequently bought a bag of Veggie Booty and was pleasantly surprised, though its flavor is a little more unconventional than Pirate's Booty.

review/summary: A substitute for popcorn addicts
review/text: I first encountered this product at COSTCO.  When they discontinued it I decided to find another source.  I have diverticulosis and the doctor says I should avoid popcorn completely.  This is a wonderful substitute.  I also am diabetic and the product has no sugar and not too much carbohydrate either.  I thought 12 bags would last about 6 months.  I didn't count on my wife and son acquiring a taste for it as well.  Twelve bags is only about a three month supply.  While other flavors are available, I think the cheddar cheese flavor best approximates the flavor of buttered popcorn. I can now watch a movie and enjoy the old custom of munching on "popcorn".  (The product is also available in much smaller bags and 60 bags at once.  That is convenient for packing in lunches, but you pay more per ounce.)

review/summary: Pirate's Booty is the best snack for kids and adults
review/text: My husband is a diabetic, my grandchildren are healthy eaters and my 85 year old parents, we all eat Pirate's Booty. It's a great all time, any time snack for all of us. I ordered a case for my father,who will eat a bag all by himself, for his 85th birthday present. I then proceeded to order my family a case.<br /><br />Thank you so much for the perfect snack.

review/summary: A bit bland really
review/text: I really wanted to like these since I try to support smaller companies as much as possible. They are ok if you eat them by the handful, other wise the cheese flavoring just doesn't come through. Personally I like them, they just need more cheese flavoring. I gave one of the bags in my case to a friend of mine who has been dieting and sticking to less processed and chemical laden foods. I figured that maybe my taste buds were a bit out of whack since I often eat foods that are strongly flavored, but she confirmed my own impressions above. Her kids didn't like them either. That really surprised me because usually they really go for junk food like this.

review/text: The shipment came in pretty quickly, the box is blue and branded as pirates booty. Inside there are 12 4oz bags as you would expect. I love these and usually have to stop myself from eating a bag in 1 sitting. At the local grocery store in town these are $2.79 for the 4oz bag. Here I got these for under $24 with the 'subscribe and save' that you can cancel right after. So you can save 30% by ordering here which is great for pirates booty fans like me.

review/text: My son and I are converts. No more of the snacks, hot fires,  potato clips, etc.  with artificial colors and flavors.  They have been replaced.  We love these. I had no idea what they tasted like when I first ordered them.  I just went by the other reviews.  I am so glad I did.  We can't find them locally, here in New Mexico. My son was addicted to Hot Fries but always admitted they made him feel terrible after he would eat them. Now, he does not feel terrible after he eats these.  They have a little soft  crunch, but not too much and they do not leave you with that icky taste in your mouth afterwards.  These are all natural so I actually feel good eating them. No guilt!

review/text: Pirate's Booty is sooo delicious. I could eat it all day long. Whenever I bring a bag into work, everyone asks for some. It tastes like white cheddar rice cakes, is the consistency of light, fluffy cheese puffs and actually looks a little bit like packing peanuts. My boyfriend loves it too even though he normally won't eat anything that's too healthy (he can't stand granola bars), so I just don't mention to him that it's gluten and cholesterol free and made with all natural ingredients.

So, I don't have to keep trying different things out. The pack of 12 4-ounce bags gives the best value. Since the product is mostly air an ounce looks like an awful lot, but it'll be finished in no time!

I decided to order the 4 oz bags because it is more oz for your money. They aren't good at all! They have NO cheese flavor at all. I am very disappointed with this! I have contacted the company to see what they say about it and will update my review once I get a response. Don't buy the 4 oz. bags!!!<br />Update**I contacted the company and they did send me a brand new box. It was much better! Apparently the 1st box I got was old!

review/summary: My 1 yr old daughter's FAVORITE snack!!
review/text: Pirate's Booty has been my 16 month old daughter's favorite snack since she was 6 months old. Great for babies who are just starting on solids because it dissolves easily in their mouth, it's gluten-free, low in sodium (has less sodium than cheerios) and it just plain tastes good. I usually throw some Pirate's Booty in a snack saver cup and carry it in my diaper bag when I'm out running errands. Whenever my daughter starts to lose her patience, I pull it out and Viola!! I've got a happy baby again. I swear, this stuff is magic!! Don't know how I would have gotten through this past year (or gotten anything done) without it!! : )<br /><br />At our local grocery store, a 4 oz bag usually sells for $2.99. Buying it by the case using Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, it comes out to $1.78 bag. That's a pretty good deal in my book, especially considering how much of this stuff my daughter can go through.

review/summary: What I think about the Pirate's Booty white cheddar
review/text: I received this package yesterday in a very sturdy box and last night I decided to try them and they are sooooooooooooo delicious.  The cheese doesn't get on your fingers or hand like the orange balls and they are fresh. The only problem is that you can't stop eating them.  They just melt in your mouth and they are crunchie.  You can be sure that when I am almost done with them, I will order them again.  I would give these twenty stars if I could plus working as a Court Stenographer in court, I am aware of identity theft and I know when I order something from Amazon, my identity and my card is safe.

review/text: My wife can't eat popcorn because of the hulls.  However, we found Pirates Booty with White Cheddar (there are other flavors too) which tasts just about like popcorn with white cheddar on it.  This stuff is great.  Seems like the stores are always out, so we bought it by mail order.  12, 4 oz. bags.  Say, thats a big box.  But really, they are crisp, tasty, baked so there's no oily fingers.  We both highly recommend it.  Check them out: [...].

No other commercial snack (yep! homemade snacks by mom are the best in the world, this comes second) comes even close to the great taste of Pirate's Booty. It indeed felt like I got hold of some great booty when I tasted it. Get it, you won't be sorry.

review/text: What can I say about these other than that they are very addicting-or is it addictive? &lt;g><br /><br />If you like cheese puffs, I have no doubt that you'll like these and they're way better for you than regular cheese puffs. Not only do they have an extremely yummy taste and texture, they are also lower in fat than the others.<br /><br />If you have kids, these would be better to give them (shoot, they'd be better to give you, too! &lt;VBG>) than the extremely high-fat cheese puffs you find in every store, and the price from Amazon isn't too bad, especially if you catch them when they're on sale for twelve dollars instead of 18.74. But, even 18.74 is a better price than you find in most grocery stores who carry them, so, go for it! But...don't blame me when you find yourself eating an entire bag in one sitting...

review/summary: Snack of Choice for 4 Generations
review/text: We have purchased boxes and boxes of Pirate's Booty over the last year.  We used to buy individual bags at Whole Foods but they are expensive and get eaten too quickly.  My 1 year old son just loves them and they are great for his self feeding skills.  My 8 year old loves them as afterschool snacks.  My husband and I enjoy them - but we try not to eat too much since these are snacks afterall and we should not have too much junk food.<br /><br />A few months ago, we shipped a box to my father in law in CA. because he got addicted to them while visiting us.  He took a few bags to visit his mother in Wyoming and she got hooked.  When she could not find any in her very small town, my father in law shipped a box from Amazon to her.  That should last her for a while since she is 96 and lives alone.<br /><br />As you can see, this is addictive so be careful with buying your first box!!  We have also tried Smart Puffs, Cannon Balls and Veggie Puffs. The green Veggie Puffs did not go over as well with my family.  Only my 1 year old son likes it!

Someone at Amazon was able to refund the purchase without this hassle.  For that I'm greatful.  If I had to box, ship and now deal with a third party and the paperwork involved.  I would not have been a happy camper.  Customers should never have to go through a third party with recall issues.  I didn't, hope none of your other customers had to go through a maze to return product.<br /><br />Note:  Product tastes good.  At least when I have bought it at health food stores.

review/summary: Very Disappointed
review/text: Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes. It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored "cake". I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment. After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.<br /><br />In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient. At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes. High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.<br /><br />All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have. One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.<br /><br />I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash.

Cherries, coconut, and Chamomile - How can you go wrong, right?<br /><br />Let's just put it this way: I made my first pot of this around 1pm. by 1:15 that pot was down the drain.<br /><br />I tried it so many ways. No sugar, little sugar, lots of sugar. Each time I took a sip I gagged. The actual product smells very sharp, and the brewed product had a VOMIT aftertaste. I'm not exaggerating here, it actually reminded me of being sick.<br /><br />Needless to say, this is the last batch I make of this flavor. It will go into the potted plants for fertilizer.

review/summary: Savings = How much?
review/text: Oatmeal is a great food. I question the supposed suggested savings being offered.<br />Since when did a canister of Oatmeal cost $35?<br /><br />That is what Amazon is saying the list price is.<br />In reality the average price is $3 to $5.<br />In fact, at this writing, Amazon actually lists a single 18oz canister as being available for $3.89<br />see  http://www.amazon.com/Quaker-Old-Fashioned-Oats-18/dp/B005GD36O8<br /><br />Using that price you actually save only $2.76  or 11.8% vs the 90% claimed.<br /><br />I don't know, perhaps Amazon is including shipping costs when they calculate the savings. However, since your local grocer includes shipping in it's advertised price, if you have to pay shipping, it's probably cheaper to go to your local grocer.<br /><br />Again, Oatmeal is great.<br />Amazon is fantastic.<br />Price is fair.<br />Just don't believe the savings claim on this product (or from what I've seen - other food products).<br /><br />Use the Trust but Verify method when shopping for anything online.

review/text: This coffee is a medium roast and it tastes like a medium roast.  It has some of the good qualities of true Kona, mild and tasty.  I can't afford true 100% Kona anymore, but this is an economical replacement.  So I use this coffee everyday since discovering it about 5 pounds (of coffee) ago.  as long as the price stays reasonable, I'll be drinking this coffee.  Occasionally I will drink a light or dark brey, but for Kona, a medium roast gives me the taste I like.  I drink about 6 cups of coffee a day because 6 cups a day is magic and a healthy part of my diet.....

review/text: This was my first experience with a kona blend and it was a very pleasant and tasteful coffee. It was sweet, with somewhat of floral undertones, with a wonderful aftertaste. All in all a very good coffee.<br /><br />One caveat for those who like full bodied and/or darker roasts: this comes accross to me as a light roast (although is labeled as a medium roast). To be honest it did take away from the experience a little for me as I prefer medium roasts, but I still give it a five star rating because of the quality of the flavor.

review/summary: good stuff for infants with food sensitivities
review/text: I nursed our daughter for over 4 long months. She was very colicky and had reflux. We kept getting nowhere with our family practice physician so switched to a pediatrician at 6 months old. After I quit nursing her, hoping putting her to formula would stabilize her diet, we went through formula after formula trying to find one that wouldn't make her gassy or throw up. She ended up having multiple food sensitivies, although not allergies. (She was sensitive to soy, dairy, and goat's milk as far as formula options before the age of 1.) Finally, we visited a pediatric g.i. physician a few times. They were the ones that told us to try this formula, saying give it 2 weeks to really see if it is working for  her or not. After 2 days, our daughter was a different girl. So much happier. she had been on  reflux meds all this time too, with no real help from them alone. Getting her on this formula really turned her around. What a relief. Not saying this will work for all babies everywhere, but it was a great finding for our daughter. Yes, it smells bad...to me. Our daughter made no faces ever and never refused it even once, even though the g.i. doctor cautioned us she might because it doesn't taste very good. She had no issues with it though.

review/summary: VERY GOOD, A NEW PANTRY STAPLE
review/text: The noodle itself was clean, bland, and fresh in flavor.  The fishy odor in the packing liquid rinsed off quickly and completely.<br /><br />To prepare I drained the packing liquid then filled the package with warm tap water and poured it off three times.  Next I poured the noodls in a strainer and rinsed for about two minutes under running water.  Last, I soaked them for half an hour in warm tap water changing the water twice; then rinsed and drained.  This was over kill as the fishy odor was gone after the first rinse but I had heard so much negative about this I took no chances. Even so, rinsing was quick with each step taking two or three minutes.<br /><br />I cooked these using a dry roasting method.  In a no stick skillet pre heated on high, I cooked the drained noodles for exactly one minute. After cooking I removed the pan from the heat and added half a tablespoon of canola oil an a tablspoon of prepared stir fry sauce along with a sprinkle of dried seasonings.  Mix and serve.<br /><br />That's it.  One package was about a cup of noodles.  They are not pasta so if that's what you are looking for you will be disapointed.  They are a lot like celophane noodles found in some Asian recipies.  These were neither tough or chewey but had some 'bite' to them.<br /><br />I will definetly buy these again for Asian style noodle dishes.
