review/summary: Carbonated Juicy Juice
review/text: This item tastes just like carbonated cherry juicy juice... or rather what cherry juicy juice would taste like if it was carbonated.  It tastes fine, but the bottom line is that I would rather just drink juicy juice and go without the carbonation.  That's basically why I rated this item at 3 stars.  It's fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get one.<br /><br />As an alternative to cola, this is probably the healthier choice.  You get far more vitamins and natural sugars than a can of coke or pepsi would provide.  However, the calorie content is still pretty high.  A 12oz can of coke is what? 200 calories?  This 8.3 oz can of cherry soda-juice is 170 calories.  Granted, they're not such empty calories if you're actually getting nutrition, but drinking these will certainly not make one thin.<br /><br />I take it that based on the name of this product, Switch, that they're marketing it as a safer alternative to cola.  And it is absolutely that.  Just don't go thinking that if you switch to juice that you'll start losing weight.  That is certainly not the case.<br /><br />That being said, I'm not sure this product is really needed in America's already bloated soft drink market.  But good luck to them anyway.

review/summary: A refreshing marketing tool
review/text: The Switch Black Cherry is a tasty, refreshing drink that tastes very much like black cherry soda.  Which is the general idea.  You're scanning the beverage aisle for drinks for the kids, the 100% juice tag catches your eye and you think "Voila!  Tastes like pop but its good for you!!"  If you want to drink soft drinks, don't be fooled, this isn't a whole lot better for you.  Equally healthy alternatives include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAYFD4">Dr Browns, Soda Black Cherry 6Pk, 72-Ounce (04 Pack)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAZQ96">Boylan, Soda Black Cherry 4Pk, 46.4-Fluid Ounce (6 Pack)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017GDP4O">Frank`s Black Cherry Wishniak</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9GB4Y">Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda, 6pk</a>.  And thats just the black cherry flavor.<br />Really, let's not kid ourselves.  Sugar derived from fruit is only slightly better for us than sugar derived from sugar cane, both of which are probably better than sugar derived from corn.  Just don't fool yourself into thinking it is actually healthy.<br />Much of the drive towards healthy soft drink alternatives stems from the 2005 American Beverage Association School Beverage Guidelines.  According to the Switch website, these beverages are now being sold in schools and are promoted as a healthy fruit juice drink.  At 126 calories an 8.3 oz Switch just meets the 130 calories per 8 oz rule.  There is no added sugar.<br />The Switch Black Cherry:  130 calories, 0 fat, 15mg sodium, 35 grams carbohydrate,  33 grams sugar, 0 protein, vitamin C 100% RDA.<br />An orange:  62 calories,  0 sodium, 15.3 grams carbohydrate, 1.23 grams protein, 3.1 grams fiber, 12.25 grams sugar, 12 vitamins & minerals.  Add a non-DHP sports bottle full of water and you have got yourself a healthier, cheaper alternative.<br />I would buy these if I were serving pizza or popcorn and wanted soda to wash it down.  Just don't kid yourself about the nutritional value.

review/summary: tasty but too sweet
review/text: This does taste like cherries and is all natural.  Of course, every all natural fruit juice is sugary, so this is going to be just as sugary and have just as many carbs as apple juice.<br /><br />Switch is simply fizzy soda water with fruit juice, which normally I love, but the taste of this cherry soda is just a little too sweet.  Most juices are cut with a certain amount of apple juice and Switch is no exception, but I think there is too much apple in this drink.  It gives the whole thing a cloying flavor.  There is a bit of aftertaste, too.<br /><br />I'm giving this 4 stars, but would rather give 3.5 if there was that option.  It's better than 3, but not quite a 4.

review/text: I give it 3 stars for being natural and no artificial ingredients, but the flavor is NOT cherry enough. The drink has too many other fruit juices in it that overpower the cherry flavor. I have no idea why they would put so much of the other juices instead of using mainly cherry juice unless the other ones are cheaper? I would not recconmmend this because it doesn't taste like cherry and the flavor is a big disappointment.

review/summary: Excellent alternative to regular Cola - Black Cherry Switch
review/text: Much better than I expected, Switch Black Cherry is an excellent "soda" type carbonated fruit juice drink.  The drink gets its sweetness from fruit juice and almost as sweet as regular soda.  The big difference between this and regular soda was the clean natural taste of Switch.  I is essentially a carbonated fruit juice so it does not contain any corn syrup.<br /><br />This drink is highly recommended although keep in mind it is more expensive than soda.

review/summary: A little lackluster
review/text: This flavor wasn't as sweet as the strawberry kiwi version, but it didn't really taste that unique either.<br /><br />It almost tasted like a really light version of chery coke, but without the coke taste. Or a cherry flavored carbonated water, except it wasn't as sweet.<br /><br />My 4 year old took a couple of sips and didn't care too much for the product because of the bland taste. The carbonate is a little overpowering and all you get is a chery after taste. Once the carbs go flat, the cherry taste is very bland.<br /><br />At the moment, I do not recommend this product. I'd prefer drinking a cherry flavored carbonated water because it would quench my thirst and taste more.

review/summary: Like Drinking Cherry Pie
review/text: I like fruit juice.  I like carbonated beverages.  I also like fruit-flavored carbonated beverages -- especially cherry soda.  So, when I ordered this item I was expecting something distinctly different than what I got.<br /><br />Most fruit juices are sweet.  However, this drink was almost too sweet as it tasted like cherry pie filling.<br /><br />I like the idea of carbonation.  I poured this into a glass and it almost seemed flat (i.e., where are the bubbles?).  I expected much more 'fizz' than I saw.  As I drank it, it didn't 'feel' fizzy either.<br /><br />That said, the drink isn't completely bad.  If you're in the mood for sweet cherry juice it's probably okay.  It just didn't 'wow' me like I expected.

review/summary: A Soda that Isn't
review/text: I'm not a soda pop fan, so I was highly skeptical about a carbonated fruit drink.  So, when I tried this, I had to say this is one of the best I've had.  It's really cherry and the fact that it's fruit juice and doesn't have added sugar is a plus.  I'd highly recommend this over any soda.  Definitely going to consider it as a summer drink.<br /><br />The can is about the size of a red bull can, making it smaller than a normal pop can, but it's good, so I really don't find that an issue.  Half the time I think the soda cans are too big anyways.

review/summary: Bright, clean black cherry taste
review/text: I was a little leery of trying this product, partly due to the fact that I am not a particular fan of anything that is a cherry flavor, even something that claims to be the juice of cherries.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, and am now a fan of this drink.<br /><br />The black cherry juice isn't the primary ingredient, but I think that prevents the flavor from being too overwhelming.  The primary ingredient is apple juice, then grape juice, and then the cherry juices.  The apple and grape juices only provide a crisp, clean base for the cherry flavor, because I don't taste either of them.  All I tasted was the light, refreshing black cherry juice flavor.  There was no unpleasant aftertaste and it wasn't overly sweet.<br /><br />Definitely chill this before drinking.  It is lightly carbonated (no shaking the can!), has no added sugar but does have added vitamin C (100% of the 'daily recommended level').  A serving is one 8.3 ounce can, 130 calories.<br /><br />Overall, this is a bright, clean-tasting, refreshing drink that won't feel heavy in your stomach and does provide some vitamin C to boot.

review/summary: Well Whoopty Do!  Not a Good Value.  Pure Marketing Gimmick.
review/text: First of all, this product claims to be "Black Cherry" flavor.  Yes, it is made from 100% juice, but cherry juice is well down the list of ingredients.  The drink has mostly apple and grape juice, and that is what I tasted more than anything else.  There is just enough cherry juice in there to give it a hint of cherry behind the apple and grape flavors.  For a cherry lover like myself, this drink was a disappointment.  Further, I think this drink is tremendously overpriced, considering it is just a little over 8 ounces of mostly apple and grape juice with some carbonation added.  If you can do without the carbonation, buy yourself some apple juice or grape juice.  It is much cheaper ounce per ounce.  You may not look as hip as you will look with this fancy can, but it is no longer fashionable to waste money anyway.

review/summary: Carbonation Makes 100 Percent Juice Lighter.  Taste is a Bit Off.
review/text: This relatively expensive convenience-packaged item is 100 percent juice and contains 130 calories worth of concentrated apple, grape, acerola, and cherry juice reconstituted with carbonated water with added vitamin C to provide 100 percent of the adult minimum daily requirement of vitamin C. There are no artificial flavors or additives which allows the manufacturer to describe this as a "natural" beverage.<br /><br />I often mix juice with seltzer water, and I like the combination quite cold. The Switch Black Cherry didn't compare well to what I'm used to in that regard.<br /><br />The carbonation makes the drink seem lighter than juice, but not as light and refreshing on the mouth as juice and seltzer.<br /><br />The black cherry flavor didn't appeal to me. This formulation doesn't have the bite that usually comes from tartness that I'm used to in juice-flavored beverages. The taste starts feeling a little blah and ends on a strong cherry-cola-like note that's stronger than I like.<br /><br />As a result, the effect is more like drinking cherry cough medicine with carbonation than it is like tasting something tasty, light, and refreshing.<br /><br />I wouldn't seek this item out again in this flavor, even though I like black cherry flavor.<br /><br />I do know that peoples' tastes vary. This flavor reminds me of the flavors that I used to taste at Heublein in pre-mixed cocktails which didn't appeal to me but which many other people found delightful.

review/summary: Syrupy...
review/text: This is my second try of a Switch beverage, and while I wasn't overwhelmed by the other (Watermelon/Strawberry), it wasn't bad (tasted a lot like carbonated apple juice to me). This time, while I can say that the Switch Black Cherry doesn't taste like mere apple juice (there is a tart, berry/cherry flavor), it is far, far too sweet. I took my first swallow out of the can and was just completely turned-off by just how sweet the beverage actually is. Served over ice and allowed to sit for a minute made it a good bit more tolerable, but when I grab something to drink, I want to drink it right then, not 5 minutes or so later. It doesn't taste bad, mind you, it's just way too sweet, almost overpoweringly so. A quick glance at the can says it all...33 grams of sugar...6 more than the same serving size of Coca-Cola. Needless to say, if you're looking for a healthy alternative to soda, this isn't the place to look (especially since there's really very little nutritional value to be found here).<br /><br />I just don't see what the market for this is. Are people crying out for carbonated juice beverages? Is this being aimed at the energy drink crowd (same 8.3 ounce size as Red Bull after all)? Does anyone actually think this is much better for you than a Coke? It's not bad, but I wouldn't pay for it, and I sure don't see much of a market for it. Maybe if they add some caffeine to the mix...

review/text: I am not at all fond of The Switch Black Cherry.  It tasted fermented, almost alcoholic, to me.  I asked my husband to try it for his opinion and he said it reminded him of Smirnoff Black Ice (which, I can't say I have tried, so I can't personally confirm his flavor comparison).<br /><br />The can touts "100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't want" explaining what it contains (100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all natural, carbonation, great taste and refreshment) and what it doesn't contain (no sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, gluten free).<br /><br />It has 130 calories, 0g fat, 15mg sodium, 35g carbs (33g sugar), 0g protein, and 100% vitamin C. The ingredients list reads, "100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, acerola, and cherry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C).<br /><br />I appreciate the attempt to make a "natural" carbonated juice beverage, but this drink is not for me.  I hope you enjoy it more.

review/text: I couldn't imagine what "carbonated fruit juice would taste like, so Black Cherry Switch was a refreshing surprise.<br />It has a very natural Cherry taste and smell, and low carbonation, so there's none of the bloat/belch factor you can get from soda.<br /><br />The 100% Juice concentrate concoction is made with apple, grape, acerola & cherry juice, plus sparkling water. That's it! It gives you 100% RDA of vitamin C, and has just 130 calories per 8.3 oz can.<br />There's no sugar added, --just natural fruit sugars-- which add up to 33g of sugar. If you're on a sugar restricted diet, you'll have to watch this.<br /><br />Those 130 calories mean it's also NOT a "diet" drink, but I think it is a healthy alternative to soda. And I thought it tasted great!

review/summary: Yet another...
review/text: INGREDIENTS<br />Yet another "natural" product trying to capitalize on the public's belief in the magic of hype.  As both a scientist & a naturopath, I would like to promote some logical analysis into the mix.  Firstly, as you may remember from chemistry class, there are various types of sugars (e.g. glucose, sucrose, fructose).  Most naturopaths prefer fructose--which often comes from fruit.  However, fruit tends to be expensive so (to be competitive) manufacturers frequently use high fructose corn syrup--a concentrated product from corn.  Guess what?  Corn is just as natural as fruit is.  But then so are sugar cane and sugar beets--but the mix of sugars differs among sources.  So, what is important is the type of sugar (not the source) and (perhaps more importantly) the amount of it--since Americans tend (according to statistics) to eat far too much sugar (and salt and fats...).  Apparently this is a learned behavior as some experiments seem to indicate.  So, giving your kids lots of sodas to keep them happy is a short term approach creating a long term problem for them--not a great legacy.  True, this product evades the addition of artificial coloring, artificial flavoring, & preservatives--this is good.  It also includes acerola (a terrific source of vitamin C--look in your vitamins catalog and notice that some Vit C tablets advertise acerola as a plus for them).  But the can doesn't say how much acerola or Vit C--only that it meets the 100% recommended dosage.  This is essentially meaningless; it's the dosage to prevent scurvy--in the West today that likelihood is pretty remote.  Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling recommends 3000 to 5000 mg of Vit C daily--more than a case of Switch per day per person to achieve.  Of course, the scientific community has not accepted Pauling's argument--but then, to my knowledge, it's never been scientifically tested either.  It works for me though.<br /><br />TASTE & PACKAGING<br />As usual, the advertised flavor is not the main ingredient--usually it's apple or pear--here it's apple & grape.  Some people will tell you they taste them.  I don't.  I think they need to do a blind taste test--one's perceptions are mostly based on one's expectations.  I doubt they'd taste apple if they didn't know it had apple in it--but who knows?  Maybe they're budding professional tasters?  I found the black cherry taste reminds me of the old Franks' Black Cherry Sodas in big bottles delivered in wooded cases when I was a kid--though Switch's seems a bit strong to me.  But, of course, the case had to last all week--so we had to drink sparingly--unlike today.  You didn't drink from those bottles directly--as you did from the old green coca-cola bottles--which tasted better than aluminum or steel cans.  I find that I can sometimes taste the steel but not the aluminum from cans.  There's none from the can here.  Aluminum may be more expensive to use.  Both can be recycled (and are, where I live).  But, it actually costs more to recycle almost anything than to get new materials--so we have to pay the county MORE to recycle.  The one glaring exception is aluminum.  Aluminum yields a profit when you recycle it.  As far as I know (except for newspapers in bulk), it's the only material that does.  So I consider the use of aluminum a plus.  Of course, there is less aluminum because it's only an 8.3 oz can vs. the more common (in the US) 12 oz can.  This may seem strange in the States, but in Europe the smaller can is quite common.  Perhaps, it would encourage people to drink less of it--which would actually be a good thing because it's just not very healthy.  You'd be better off drinking water.  And, even bottled water is a lot cheaper per oz. than the almost $1 per can even if you buy a case with the Amazon $1 off/case discount.  So, if you buy it, drink it for the taste, not for its supposed health contribution.

The short ingredient list is a healthy improvement over soda pop.  One consideration is that, even though there is no sugar added and no corn syrup added, there is still 33g of sugar in one serving.  However, if you want real juice, the carbs will be unavoidable.  The only down side is the price.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: These 8.3 oz cans of Switch keep their promise. There are no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It is a carbonated all natural 100% juice. Like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Acerola, and Cherry Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). I was surprised to see Cherry as the last listed juice concentrate. Each can has 130 calories, 15mg of sodium, 35g of carbohydrates, 33g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C. This sparkling juice tasted good as you drank it, has an identifiable taste of cherry, but it has a very unpleasant after taste. This after taste is enough for me to not want to try this again. I did enjoy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40">The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> flavor.

review/summary: Pricey, Sweet, Colored Water
review/text: Pricey:  About $12.56 per gallon with Amazon'z 15% discount and free shipping or $14.77 per gallon with free shipping and no discount.  To much for me.  You can buy a bottle of soda water, cherry juice and sugar for a lot less and it will taste similar.  Additionally, it seems like just a few months ago that we moaned every time we had to fill the gas tank for $4 a gallon.  That was gas and even with our gas guzzler that goes into heat every time it sees a gas station, it was a  tad cheaper than Switch.<br />Sweet:  With 33 grams of sugar this is just too much.  That produces an eight ounce can's 130 calories.  If you drink a 16 ounce container of this drink you will get 250 calories.  A regular Coke or Dr. Pepper each has fewer grams of sugar and therefore fewer calories compared to Switch.<br />Colored Water:  Calling this 100% Juice is probably permitted by our government or whomever sets those words in practice, but this is mostly carbonated water.  I guess carbonating the water makes it more expensive but that expensive?<br />Taste:  Pleasant and not a lagging post taste.<br />Bottom Line:  Buy it in the store:  No.  Buy it anywhere:  Probably not.  The cost per unit compared to the payback does not calculate especially when every penny is important.

review/text: I didn't care much for the flavor of this soda. It has an after taste that reminded me of medicine. The smell is a bit sickly, too. I gave it three stars due to the lack of sugar. I'd recommend the orange tangerine or kiwi berry over this one.<br /><br />Ingredients: 100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, acerola and cherry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C).

review/summary: Nothing that sets it apart
review/text: The drink is nothing exemplary in my opinion. Its taste is tolerable but nothing that made me want to order more of the product. While it is 100% juice and contains 100% of one's recommended daily amount of vitamin C, I could not agree that it had a "great taste and refreshment" about it.<br /><br />The drink also left a little bitter aftertaste. However, this was not a big deal.<br /><br />The can was probably more negative to me than anything. I am not certain why is was necessary to use an aluminum can for 8.5 ounces. Of course, this is switchbev's choice. However, I think it a poor one for our environment.

review/summary: It may be a healthier soda, but not a tastier one.
review/text: As the product information says this beverage is a carbonated juice-like beverage and it comes in a variety of different flavors.  It contains 100% juice, 100% Vitamin C, and is all natural.  The beverage has no sugar added (although there are 33g of it already), no preservatives, no corn syrup, and no artificial coloring.<br /><br />It was a fizzy drink, and the idea of a juice that contains real juice and is also carbonated is a real cool idea; but I just wish it tasted better.  On the can it claims to have great taste and be refreshing.  Well, in my opinion it was sort of refreshing, but not so great on the taste.  It was kind of tart and no very sweet tasting as other fruit flavoredd sodas are (orange, grape, strawberry).  I do realize that this might be do to the no sugars added thing.  My husband described it as "cherry cough syrup," and he wasn't wild about the taste either.<br /><br />It is a great concept and maybe down the road it will be possible for a juice that's good for you to be carbonated and taste good.  However, we will not be purchasing this product any time soon.

review/summary: Taste is only fair, not worth the money
review/text: This is carbonated juice.  I love cherries, so I was excited to receive this product.  The taste is only fair.  I think it is something that a kid would like.  The cherry taste is more of a juice mixture taste, not a pure cherry flavor.  The good news is that this drink has no artificial sweeteners or added sugar.  A healthy alternative for those who would like a soda/carbonated beverage.  I would prefer soda water with lemon or lime over this drink.

review/summary: A step-down in sweetness from soda but still has a lot of sugar
review/text: I love cherry juice but it is hard to find in normal stores. I was expecting something tasting like cherry but that is not what this flavor is about. Cheery is actually the last (so least) of the juices included in the blend. To be fair, there is a hint of cherry taste but much more of an apple and grape taste.<br /><br />Switch Black Cherry is very good if you are looking for a drink that is a step-down in sweetness from soda but there still is a lot of sugar in there. So if flavored seltzer is too bland, this may be a nice middle ground compared to sodas that are full of sugar.

review/summary: So what'cha what'cha what'cha want (what'cha want)?
review/text: It's right on the can: "100% of What You Want, 0% of What You Don't." Does Switch Black Cherry soda live up to its slogan?<br /><br />Well, let me describe what it's like to drink the soda first:<br />* Very light carbonation, almost unnoticeable<br />* The predominant flavor is syrupy cherry layered on top of an apple and grape background. The cherry taste is not well integrated with the other flavors; it floats above everything else.<br />* Even though no sugar or other sweeteners have been added, the soda is cloyingly sweet to my taste.<br /><br />A quick look at the Nutrition Facts panel shows why Switch tastes so sweet: one 8.3 oz. can contains 33 grams of sugar (and 130 calories to boot).  Those reconstituted juice concentrates--that's right, it's not made from fresh fruit juice--pack quite a caloric and sugar punch, don't they?<br /><br />So, you have to ask yourself: what am I looking for in a soda? If avoiding artificial ingredients and sweeteners is your paramount interest, Switch fits the bill <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000DECC">100%</a>. If, on the other hand, you like fizzy sodas or prefer drinks that aren't super sweet, Switch will be 0% satisfying to you.

review/summary: Great flavor, but too high in sugars
review/text: Even though there is no added sugar, this small can packs in 130 calories and 33 grams of sugars via fruit juices.  That's the down side.  The plus is the flavor - it tastes of cherry with some fizz, but not too much.  If you've ever had Knudsen's Cherry Cider, that's what this tastes like, with some carbonation.<br /><br />While I like the taste, the high calorie and sugar count for 8 oz. is why I gave it three stars.  If you don't have to worry about sugar and calories, this is a tasty treat.

review/text: Too sweet for adults and too small for kids - with little real black cherry flavor. I remenber buying soda like this many years ago. It tasted like black cherry, was bubbly, and had a little tart character. The manufacturers need to identify their customer.  As presented, this is a boutique soda, but without character.  Too bad. The adult world could use a tasty all-natural refereshing beverage of moderate size.

review/text: I love soda probably more than I should and one of my favorite flavors for it is cherry. But this soda was sickeningly sweet. I had a Cherokee Red and then this and the Switch tasted like bad cough syrup. I know they claim that it's only good ingredients and nothing bad for you in it, but that makes me wonder how the heck their getting this so sweet. Maybe if they dialed the sweetness back it would be OK. But as is, I tossed most of this down my kitchen sink and that's a cardinal sin in my house.

review/summary: Fresh tasting soft drink - all juice, no sugar added
review/text: I tried the Black Cherry flavor of Switch and it definitely has a nice cherry taste to it.  I kept thinking this is the flavor they should add to Coke....<br /><br />I'd compare this to Izze, and I think they are both good.  My kids said they prefer Switch to Izze.  I think I prefer Izze because it has a somewhat lighter flavor, but I can see why someone would like the slightly more robust flavor of Switch.<br /><br />The slogan of Switch is "100% of what you want" - pure juice - & "0% of what you don't" - preservatives, additives, etc.  It is worth noting that like all fruit juices this is fairly high in sugar - fructose instead of glucose, but still it is 33g of sugar per can.  Still, if you are in the mood for pure, fresh, carbonated juice, it's not at all bad.

review/summary: Mild, but good flavor; more cherry smell than taste. Pricey.
review/text: Since I'm a mom always on the lookout for healthy soda alternatives, I decided to give this product a shot. Its review depends on your point of comparison. As a soda alternative, it rates mediocre. As a juicebox alternative? Through the roof.<br /><br />I shared the sample with my 11-year-old son; he's the one I'm shopping for. Good eye and nose appeal, I'd say, with a light, pleasant color and a really appealing cherry scent. The flavor was sweet, but mild; carbonation gave it an extra boost. On first sip, my 11-year-old son said, "Tastes like apple juice, with a kick." On second sip, he added, "It's a lot like apple cider." (Not surprisingly, concentrated apple juice is first on the list of ingredients.) "Would you want to drink it again?" I asked him. "Oh, definitely!" he said. He took another sip. "But I want to try another flavor."<br /><br />I'd probably concur. I love cherry, but there wasn't much of that in this. It surely smelled good, though.<br /><br />Point by point, this seems to be on par for health value with our favorite brand of juice box, which is also 100% juice, no sugar added, and packed with vitamin C. The Switch is much higher in sugar, lower in salt. (In fact, The Switch is higher in sugar than many sodas. Coca Cola has 3.25 g. of sugar per oz. The Switch has 3.97. But it's a fruit juice, so that's pretty much what you'd expect.)<br /><br />In price, though, there's a big difference. My relatively overpriced grocer charges 6 cents per fluid ounce for our juice box brand. At the current rate of $24 per 24, The Switch costs twice that much. In exchange, you get a little added carbonation kick and cooler packaging (right down to the eye-catching logo and the upside down "the").<br /><br />For us, this is likely to become an occasional treat. But I think we'll give a different flavor a try next.<br /><br />Pros: Pleasant flavor, light fizz, natural.<br />Cons: High price, high sugar content, more apple flavor than cherry.

review/summary: THE SWITCH
review/text: The Switch, is a refreshing carbonated juice, with no added sugars or preservatives.  It is a good replacement for sugary sodas.  It taste a little like a cross between sparkling water, Faygo pop, and fruit juice, with a surprisingly good flavor and refreshing fizz.  It is a little costly, about 96 cents for an 8.3 fluid ounce can.  However, the extra money you spend on The Switch, you might just save in dentist bills.

review/summary: Juice pop.  Great for cocktails!
review/text: The idea of a carbonated 100% fruit drink seems so simple I am surprised I have never encountered it before.  No extra sugar or nastiness added, just some carbonated bubbles and you are good to go.<br /><br />Drinking it is a little strange at first.  It is refreshing like a normal carbonated soda, but the flavor is all fruit.  I love black cherries, so I was thrilled by the flavor.  There is a slight aftertaste that you wouldn't get with normal pure fruit juice, and I can only assume that comes from the carbonation.<br /><br />The only problem with Switch is the small can size compared with the price.  Obviously, one expects to pay a bit more for more natural products, and pure juice is always more expensive than soda pop.  However, I knocked this one back pretty quickly, in just a few swallows, and on a hot day I would definitely want more.<br /><br />Where I think the Switch drinks really score is as a mixer for cocktails.  Try this with some vodka and ice, and it makes a really nice drink.  The pure fruit juice and carbonation make for a magical mixture.

review/summary: Light, Pure, But Small
review/text: I find most sodas to be a little heavy with flavor and carbonation (just my own taste), but "Switch" is a little lighter on both counts.  I do like black cherry and it's subtle enough, but 8.3 ounces is not very satisfying.  I can gulp that down in three moves.  They have added enough "vitamin C" (and I DO believe in lots of "Vitamin C" for health), but like most `natural type' sodas, it is not a pure mix.  This black cherry also contains apple, grape and cherry juices.<br /><br />But for about one dollar a can, it's not a bad choice and there are no bad ingredients.  Like most beverages, you'd have to taste it to see if it's to your liking as all that is so subjective.  Good tasting to you!

review/summary: a very good alternative to your typical soda
review/text: First and foremost, I am not a big fan of soft drinks.  Too much sugar and way too unhealthy for any person.  This goes for diet as well - trading sugar for chemicals is absurd.<br /><br />Fruit juices are ok, but they are so over processed that any of the healthy aspects of the juice are boiled or filtered out and all you are left with is a sweet fluid that has naturals sugars instead of added sucrose - better but not by much.<br /><br />Switch Black Cherry is a great offering that replaces added sucrose and fructose for real fruit juices.  It is very refreshing and every bit as tasty as some artificially colored and sweetened brand name soda.  I was impressed.<br /><br />The only downside from my perspective is that they use highly filtered juices.  They do this so that the end product has the same look and feel to the mass marketed name brands, but I would prefer unfiltered juice and I would not be bothered by a slightly more colloid appearance.  But this is nit picking on my part.<br /><br />This is a great product with a great taste.  If you like sodas, you will like this a lot.

review/summary: Very Tasty, Light and Refreshing, Small Serving
review/text: As a big fan of both sodas and juices, I was eager to try this out. I was also skeptical, but I don't like energy drinks or any of the new fad kind of sodas.<br /><br />I just had my first "Black Cherry Switch" and have to say I was really pleased with it.  It was a very "light" soda with little carbonation and a lot of taste.  The Black Cherry was right-on. There was no aftertaste, since this is real sugar, and it was perfectly tart without overdoing it.<br /><br />My only disappointment with the product is the tiny can (8.3 oz). I'm not a fan of those, and even at Amazon's low prices these drinks are very expensive.<br /><br />For the healthy conscious, this is something you should look into.  There is real sugar, and no caffeine, no artificial stuff.  The ingredients are simple.  But don't think you're going to lose weight on this stuff.  There's 130 calories per tiny can, which is just a little bit fewer than the same serving size of Mountain Dew.  But since this is 100% juice, it's probably a little healthier.

review/summary: At best it's just OK.
review/text: I'm not overly a big fan of these natural, alternative-to-soda type of drinks. But I do enjoy a good black cherry soda once in a while. So when I saw that one of the flavors for Switch was black cherry I thought, why not give it a shot.<br /><br />Overall, it's not a bad drink. The positive is that it's 100% juice, contains no "added" sugar, and has vitamin C. Plus it's carbonated in an attempt to appeal to us soda freaks.<br /><br />The negative with it is that while the flavor is decent, overall it is NOT what I would call a refreshing drink. The taste is a little too bold and somewhat bitter. I tried drinking part of it right from the can and the rest over ice. Neither really appealed to me enough to want to go out and buy more. One can was enough for me.<br /><br />Unless you are into the all natural, somewhat healthy type of drink, I would recommend passing on this one.

review/summary: Great taste, but ---
review/text: I really liked the taste of both this and one other flavor that we were able to order.  So I went on line to see what kind of pricing there was on it.  At only 8.3 oz. for about a dollar, that's roughly the equivalent of $1.50 for a single can if it was a full 12 oz. soft drink.  Our budget isn't going to justify ongoing purchases of this product.  If we had more discretionary money, we might do it, but it'd be more of a treat than a regularly used product (partly because of the small size).  So the taste was at least 4-stars, but the price brought it down considerably - even recognizing the fact that the ingredients are far better than what is in most other soft drinks.

The carbonation is light, so if you're looking for something with a lot of kick, this might not suit you.  But I think it compliments the fruit flavor nicely.<br /><br />Two things took me aback:  First, that the can was just a bit over 8oz, which is small for those of us used to normal-size carbonated beverage cans.  And second, in spite of having no added sugar, it's really quite sweet.  I found it almost too sweet for my taste.<br /><br />It's a nice change from soda, but given the amount you get for the price, I don't think it's a great deal.

review/text: When I got this product, I was a little disappointed that it was a small, skinny can of 8.3 oz.  But I wasn't disappointed with the taste.  It's very fruity and with the right amount of carbonation.  It's smooth, has a pleasant natural color, and it's packed with Vitamin C.  Although there is no sugar added, the sweetness comes from the fruit itself, which is still considered a form of sugar (fructose) so I wouldn't advise diabetics to drink Switch.  Switch Black Cherry is a winner, perfect for a quick pick-me-up. Although it's not as big a regular soda can, it's perfect for an older kid's lunchbox.  It's juice but with a kick!

review/summary: Great Alternative to High Fructose Corn Syrup Laden Sodas
review/text: I have long been a fan of mixing juice, such as orange joice, with a carbonated soda like 7Up - it provided the best of both worlds, fresh juice and carbonation. The down side over the last number of years is the high fructose corn syrup that has replaced sugar in the carbonated sodas.<br /><br />But, of late there have been alternatives. First there was Orangina, which mixed 12% orange juice with carbonated soda - still had the sugar, but far better than mainstream sodas. Then a number of drinks have become available that mix the carbonation with a high percentage of real fruit juices. Some of these have been underwhelming to say the least. The best so far is IZZE with its 70% fruit juice and 30% carbonated water - no added sugars.<br /><br />Now comes along The Switch. The Switch is 100% fruit juice with carbonation added. And, like IZZE, I really like this drink. It is different than IZZE drinks; The Switch blends their juices different to achieve a little more subtle flavor where IZZE has more tang and punch. I can't say one is better than the other only that they each deliver a different refreshing experience.<br /><br />I have tried The Switch in Orange Tangerine and Black Cherry. The Orange Tangerine is very good! I highly recommend it. The Black Cherry is good, better than some other cherry drinks of this sort I have had, but it could be a bit better; it doesn't quite deliver the same flavor experience of a really good Black Cherry soda.

That alone makes it a wonderful beverage to have as an alternative to soda. My kids liked it too. Does pack a bunch of calories but as it is intended to replace syrupy carbonated beverages I guess you have to trade off something with a compromise.<br /><br />The can is more like a redbull can and not a traditional soda can.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.

Many cherry flavored products I've tried taste more like an apple juice combo but this has a strong cherry flavor.<br />They do not seem to be as highly carbonated as soda. Honestly I don't think the carbonation does anything for the drink but it doesn't hurt it any either. Maybe good if you need to fool your kids into thinking they are getting soda.<br />The cans are only about 3/4 the size of a regular soda can. I would like to see them come out with a 2-liter version.

review/summary: Great fruit drink
review/text: I'm diabetic, so I'm always looking for natural, flavorful drinks without a lot of added sugar. Switch fits the bill for me. It's lightly carbonated, much less than a regular soda. The fruit flavor is very natural. The Black Cherry really tastes like black cherries.<br /><br />I generally avoid cherry flavored drinks, because they tend to be overly sweet and don't taste "natural" to me. (I hate "wild cherry" flavor!) Switch Black Cherry was just right, and the drink is very refreshing.<br /><br />The can is also smaller than a regular soda can. That's okay with me, it's fine for a light drink when I'm thirsty. A full can of soda is sometimes a bit too much.<br /><br />Switch will probably become one of my drink alternatives, and I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors.

review/summary: Soda Juice II
review/text: In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself. But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water? Thus was born...<br /><br />Soda Juice!<br /><br />And I tasted it, and it was Good! Frankly, I found Black Cherry, Kiwi Berry, and Watermelon Strawberry pretty similar in taste, Orange Tangerine more distinctly tart, but I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />In the cans you have 5 other flavor choices: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH2C">The Switch Fruit Punch, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG943G">The Switch Grape, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40">The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used. Fruit Punch, Orange Tangerine, and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest calories, 140; Kiwi Berry is next, 135; Black Cherry is next, 130; and Grape has the lowest, 125.  Orange Tangerine and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 36g; Black Cherry and Fruit Punch are next, 35g; Kiwi Berry is next, 34g; and Grape has the lowest, 33g. Finally Watermelon Strawberry has the highest sugars, 35g; Fruit Punch and Orange Tangerine are next, 34g; Black Cherry and Kiwi Berry are next, 33g, and Grape is the lowest, 32g.<br /><br />Note: all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice. All contain acerola, apple, and grape juice. In addition to their title juices Kiwi Berry contains raspberry and strawberry, and Fruit Punch contains cherry, lemon, and pineapple.  Orange Tangerine also contains soy.<br /><br />Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXTC">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  The difference? The Izze products are fortified with vitamins: B6 and Niacin in addition to C and have roughly three fifths the calories, total carbohydrates, and sugars of The Switch products.

review/summary: Delicious, but too small, but then, it's just as well.
review/text: I don't care if it is just juice concentrate, reconstituted with carbonated water instead of plain water -- the stuff tastes good!  The carbonation makes it taste nice and light, instead of super-sweet or -strong like many juices.  As a heartfelt devourer of all things cherry, I really liked this Switch black cherry drink.<br /><br />On the other hand, it was so tasty, so light, so refreshing, that I easily could have knocked down three or four of these SMALL 8.3 ounce cans.  However, seeing as the primary ingredient is (reconstituted) APPLE juice (that's right, NOT cherry!) and the tiny can has 130 Calories of sugars (natural to the juice, I'm sure, but still) - it is probably a good thing the can is so small, or I'd have had 500 calories just like that!  Even Coke only has about 100 calories per 8 ounces!<br /><br />Anyway, Switch tastes awesome.  When I get more, I want to try it as a mixer with vodka.  And I wish the flavor was a little bit more cherry and less apple/grape.

review/summary: Delicious Glaze
review/text: The black cherry flavor tastes  pretty good.<br /><br />Although my assistant taster and I did not care for the orange Switch, we  like the black cherry.  Most people are preconditioned about orange flavor. It is supposed to taste a certain way, but black cherry has more freedom to be individual.<br /><br />I discovered a wonderful way to use Switch black cherry -  cooking salmon!  I mixed the Switch black cherry  in the blender with a half cup brown sugar and a tablespoon of honey.  To that I added a shake of Chinese five spice, a shake of  ground cloves, and approximately 1 teaspoon of dry mustard.  I mixed that in the blender.  I sprayed a baking pan with butter flavored cooking spray.  Then I placed boneless salmon  - about one fourth fish - in the middle of the pan and surrounded it with slices of peeled pre-baked sweet potatoes.  The liquid from the blender went on top of  all of it.  Into a hot oven (450 degrees) went the pan.  As soon as the liquid bubbled, I carefully turned the salmon over, basted it with the glaze, and let it cook five minutes.  While it was still in the pan, I cut it into two servings, topped it with pecan pieces and returned it to the hot oven  another two minutes to heat the pecans.  It was pretty on the plate!  I poured some of the glaze over it.  Yummy!<br /><br />Switch black cherry would be nice in ham glaze too.<br /><br />Mary Lou Cheatham (Jane Riley)<br />Author of Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook

review/summary: The true un-soda
review/text: The Switch Black Cherry is one of the most refreshing drinks that I have ever tried. It is 100% pure cherry juice and the difference from the regular sodas is quite obvious. Right from the first sip it feels richer and tastier than any soda product out there. After drinking it, you may never go back to regular sodas again. It works well by itself or with a meal. This may be an ideal substitute for sodas for kids, as it is a much more nutritious drink. The only problem that I have is the size of the can. At 8.3 ounces it may be enough for a kid, but you would need more than one of these to quench an adult's thirst.

The Switch is so much better than regular soda because it has none of the junk and all of the flavor - PLUS it is 100% Juice!  We have tried some of the other sparkling juice drinks, but they taste watered down and were only 70% juice. I feel great about ordering The Switch for my kids - and I am a hero for keeping it stocked at home!

review/text: Thank goodness a carbonated drink that is tasty without all the additives.  Taste like the cherry drinks out there, but slightly lighter in flavoring and not too empowering.  although the can is less than half the volume of a normal can, I do wonder why when things are this good for you that it comes in a such small size?  At least it is in a can that can be recycled.

review/summary: Not really the best of either world
review/text: I love cherry cola, and generally anything cherry, and I like most anything carbonated.  However, the drink was not the really the dream combination I would have guessed.  I appreciate that it's all natural, 100% juice, with all your day's vitamin C---lots of good reasons to drink it.  However, the taste is not one, for me anyway.  It tasted like a very sweet juice, not really a heavy cherry flavor, sort of just a general red juice type flavor you can get by sipping juice boxes!  The carbonation was very light, almost not noticable.  The can is SMALL, 8.3oz, and I can't imagine it really being enough for most adults to totally quench their thirst.  For almost a dollar a can, you would expect more---in terms of gourmet type taste, amount of product and in general, something more special!

review/summary: Juicy and Delicious
review/text: I have a tendency to avoid products with artificial sweeteners, and this includes high fructose corn syrup.  The Switch is a line of fruit juice sodas with no added sweeteners--not even cane sugar.  It has carbonated water, fruit juice, some natural flavors and colors, and vitamin C.  If you're going to drink soda, carbonated fruit juice is the best way to go.<br /><br />The Switch has five different flavors in eight-ounce cans.  The Black Cherry is a combination of apple, grape, cherry, and acerola juices.  Acerola is a fruit high in vitamin C and antioxidants.  The Black Cherry flavor is sweet without being too sweet and very fruity.  If you enjoy fruity beverages, you will love The Switch Black Cherry.<br /><br />I only wish the can were bigger!

review/summary: Nothing Special
review/text: I tested this my family, including a 7 year old boy and 6 year old girl. They said it tasted good but wasn't sweet enough for them. They are right. It is mildly sweet and that probably appeals to whoever they are aiming this at. To me, the flavor of the Black Cherry was true and it left no after taste. It's a competent carbonated fruit juice drink, but nothing to e-mail home about.<br /><br />One thing that puzzled me was the small size of the can. 8.3 fl oz, or 245 ml. Why? If you want to enjoy a nice beverage, I think 12 fl oz is best. People may end up drinking 2 cans to quench a thirst. What was odd is that they print on the can "Let's keep the planet healthy....Please recycle this can" yet I think they are using more packaging than needed.<br /><br />I'm not sure how big a market this product is aimed at, but it must be small. A quick check of my local natural foods supermarket found a couple of similar products for a lot less cost. It isn't even a premium drink, based on the fact it is made from juice concentrates and not fresh juice. I think you could do better simply adding your own juice to soda water.

I would not say this is a bad product just because I did not like the taste. It was decent and could easily appeal to a huge swath of people out there. I still would not give this to my kids even if they did like it as It would get them used to carbonation which would lead to soda drinking eventually. For now they hate carbonation and I would like to keep it that way.

review/summary: Switch?  Maybe Not
review/text: The Switch is the latest entry in the `healthy' fruit juice + carbonated water movement.  And, the black cherry flavor is, indeed, flavorful, but its taste is more apple than black cherry and it is far too sweet for my taste. Which leads me directly to this point . .<br /><br />don't make the switch in order to save calories.  This 8.3 ounce can contains 130 calories, more than 8.3 ounces of Classic Coke (101 calories) or 8.3 ounces of Pepsi (104 calories).<br /><br />The manufacturer says no sugar has been added to this fruit drink.  Here the operative word is "added." With 33 grams of sugar listed on the label, this drink is loaded with fructose.  It does contain vitamin C, but otherwise, there's not much here to support the manufacturer's claim that this drink is a healthy alternative to anything.<br /><br />I've been a big fan of Izze for almost a year, and even asked our local grocer to stock it (he didn't, but both Target and WalMart do).  So will I switch to The Switch?  Not.  Izze's juice drinks have more of the advertised flavor but 35 fewer calories.<br /><br />By the way, the manufacturer's site says "The Switch" refers to a skateboarding move rather than a suggestion to change to their brand.  Hmmm - are they trying to tell me something?<br /><br />Three stars

review/summary: Delicious, but too much sugar
review/text: As a nursing mom, I can't drink caffeine (it makes my baby fussy), and I'm getting REALLY sick of Sprite and Sierra Mist. So I was thrilled to try the Switch carbonated juices -- sometimes you just want something fizzy!<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor is indeed delicious (though, as some reviewers have noted, there is a strong apple flavor -- apple juice is the first ingredient), but I was shocked to see 33g of sugar on the label. That's a LOT of sugar for an 8.3-ounce can! Ounce for ounce, it's more sugar than Sierra Mist, which really surprised me.<br /><br />So I'll definitely drink this again, but unfortunately, the amount of sugar and the relative lack of nutrients in apple juice don't make it a wildly better choice than pop.

review/text: OK folks: I have to tell you I'm one of these people that tries every kind of black cherry soda I can find. Once upon a time, in the days before colas and Dr. Pepper were totally dominant in the market, and before the days of Mountain Dew, Black Cherry sodas were plentiful. It's harder to find them now. And if you were fan of black cherry, some sodas were super artificial in taste, and others tasted more natural. The Switch beverages are among the best on the market and the good news is: The Switch Black Cherry is one of their best flavors. The only bad news is that The Switch cans are small and you'll want to have more and more. It's natural tasting, has good, natural ingredients and it gives you a natural energy boost. And if you haven't tried black cherry...the BEST WAY is to try it drinking The Switch Black Cherry. You'll become hooked. Take THAT colas and Dr. Pepper!

review/summary: Why?
review/text: I just don't understand why a product such as this even exists. If I wanted a soda, I would drink a soda. If I wanted to drink fruit juice, I would drink fruit juice. Both have their own merits and qualities. This product just seems to fall "flat" when compared to either soda or juice.<br /><br />The high amount of carbohydrates and ridiculous amount of sugar makes it just as bad as soda or fruit juice, from the standpoint of raising one's blood sugar levels and causing obesity. Diabetics will want to avoid it altogether. How much protein does it contain? Zero.<br /><br />As has been noted by other reviewers, the carbonation is definitely much less than with most sodas, which gives it a bit of a "flat" taste. Speaking of taste, it didn't really taste much at all like black cherry. Take one look at the ingredient list, and you'll see why. It's mostly apple and grape juice, which is MUCH cheaper for the company to buy than using real, black cherry flavoring, which there is barely a hint of.<br /><br />Those of you thinking that there is enough real juice in this beverage to give the listed 100% RDA of Vitamin C are in for a surprise. The only reason that this beverage is able to make the 100% RDA claim is because it separately adds ascorbic acid as an ingredient. In other words, they sprinkle in some powdered Vitamin C in order to make it healthier. If you drank an 8 ounce glass of water, along with a Vitamin C tablet, you would get the same amount of nutrition, while avoiding the extra calories and sugar.<br /><br />The taste is just "o.k.", at best. Altogether, it isn't necessarily "bad" for you, but there are certainly much healthier things for one to drink. What I really find difficult to understand it why this product is so darned expensive. If you're going to spend that much money, you might as well just buy real fruit juice. I wouldn't buy this product unless it was at least 75% less expensive than it is now.

There are no preservatives, strange industrial-sounding chemicals, minerals, artificial flavors or colors, or high fructose corn syrup--which has been getting a knock from some nutritionists lately.<br /><br />ALthough listed above, here's another look at the ingredients:<br />Ingredients: 100% Juice (Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, Apple, Grape, Acerola and Cherry Juice Concentrates). Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C).<br /><br />I took a few sips without looking at the label. THe bouquet--if one may sue that term for a drink costing less than $1.00-- was nicely black cherry, but the taste seemed "off."  However, the brain is a wondrous thing: After reading the list of multiple fruit concentrates on the can, my taste expectations changed and I enjoyed the drink more.  There's nice carbonation bite in the aftertaste, and it's light and refreshing--perhaps due in part to the absence of corn syrup. I may have detected a slightly metallic taste but that may have been psychology too as I was holding a metal can.  Ideally, this would come in a bottle, but perhaps that would drive up the price.<br /><br />The nutritional quality seems, once again, more impressive for what you're not getting than for any particular benefit. It kept me "hydrated" with no fat, 130 calories, 15 mg of potassium, 35 mg of carbohydrates (33 mg of which are due to sugar (fruit may be good for you but it's apparently high in sugar content), 100% of Vitamin C due in part to adding Ascorbic Acid (VItamin C). There are no other measurable VItamins listed, no fiber (not a surprise) and no protein (not a surprise either).<br /><br />Price<br />Let's compare this to another quality (i.e., slightly more expensive cherry drink, Dr. Brown's Cherry Soda. A 24 pack of 12 ounce cans (288 total ounces) costs 24.99, compared to the Switch's regular price of $24 for 24 cans at 8.3 ounce per can (199.2 total ounces). That comes out to 8.67 cents per can for the Doc, and 12.04 cents per can for the Switch. Dr. Brown's has an incredible cherry flavor (and it does come in bottles, but at 15.75 cents per ounce) but you're getting high fructose corn syrup, caramel coloring, sodium benzoate as a preservative, and Red 40 for additional coloring.<br /><br />I think the price is reasonable given all of the so-called "Vitamin Waters" (here's a novel idea, take a vitamin with some water from the tap), and for those who practically NEED a little carbonation to feel refreshed, this is an excellent product. For pure cherry taste, however, I'd probably go with Boylan's or Dr. Brown's high quality, but more traditionally soda-like drinks.  Bottom line, Switch is worth trying, but if you're buying through Amazon, make sure you spend $25 or more so that you don't pay shipping!

review/summary: If You Like A Heavily Medicinal-Tasting Soft Drink With A Long-Lasting Unpleasant Aftertaste,Then Switch Black Cherry Is For You
review/text: Being a big fan of carbonated soft drinks, juice drinks and the black cherry flavor, I couldn't wait to get my free sample from Vine. The old adage "Be careful what you wish for" has rarely applied more than to The Switch Black Cherry product. The black cherry flavor was like drinking cough medicine. The overall lingering taste in the mouth after swallowing is very unpleasant. Further, the 8.3 fl oz drink is high in total carbs (35g), sugar (33g) and calories (130). My overall opinion of this product is that it is not worth drinking -- even for free. If these observations don't turn you off, drink up and enjoy!

review/summary: Tastes good, but so do other soft drinks.
review/text: There isn't a very distinct cherry flavor so much as a generic fruit punch that happens to have cherry in it. The carbonation is very light, though it doesn't make The Switch taste much lighter than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GPXRQS">Juicy Juice</a>. Overall, it tastes pretty decent, though not much like you'd expect it to when you take the energy drink type of packaging in to consideration.<br /><br />Reading the label is a bit disheartening. True, it's 100% juice, but it's from concentrate. There's no added sugar or corn syrup -- but the 8.3 ounce can packs 130 calories. In fact, compared to a 12 ounce can of Coke, the Nutrition Facts label tells a surprising tale:<br />Calories: The Switch - 130 / Coke - 140<br />Sodium: The Switch - 15mg (1%) / Coke - 50mg (2%)<br />Carbohydrates: The Switch - 35g (12%) / Coke - 39g (13%)<br />Sugar: The Switch - 33g / Coke - 39g<br /><br />Kind of surprising, when you consider that the values for Coke are for 50% more product. So I'm not really clear on how The Switch is promoting itself as substantially better than any soft drink on the market. Sure, you're getting 100% of your RDA of Vitamin C, but anymore, getting that much Vitamin C is easy to do without even trying.<br /><br />The product isn't bad, it just isn't very practical. You could buy a bottle of Juicy Juice (or any of the 100% juice options from store brands at most retailers), mix it with a little club soda, and have basically the same product for 1/4 of the price. If you side towards the more environmentally conscious mindset (and makers of The Switch seem to think that their customers do, based on the labeling), that's an all around better alternative to a pack of 24 small cans.

review/summary: 130 calories for 8 oz of beverage
review/text: I guess it depends on your priorities, but I usually drink a "sparkling water with juice" sweetened with Splenda which is only 4 calories to a 17.2 oz bottle and tastes refreshingly light and like the juice it says on the label. Compared to the Black Cherry Switch beverage, which is 130 calories for 8.3 oz and tastes mostly like apple juice. There are those who won't consume the artificial sweeteners but for me, I'd much rather consume that 130 calories on something other than a high calorie beverage, no matter how "natural" it is.<br /><br />The flavor is OK, though it does taste mostly like apple juice, you only get a hint of cherry as almost an aftertaste. It's also a small, small can, certainly not a good value cost-wise. But that's the case with most packaged beverages, so not a huge issue if you're already buying something similar.<br /><br />My take is that it's marketed as "healthy" but the calorie content just doesn't make it a choice that works for me.

review/summary: Yum, but...
review/text: This is a ripe little drink that tastes remarkably like cherry, despite the combination of other fruit juices that make up this 'cherry' beverage.<br /><br />I am not a big pop drinker, but I like fizz.  I like fizzy waters, I like fizzy juices.  This was flavorsome and fizzy, fruity and yummy.  My son wanted a taste and ended up stealing the remaining contents from me, much to my dismay.<br /><br />The cons of this refreshing beverage are its contents.  At just a little over 8 ounces (a Cup) this drink contains 130 calories, 33 grams of sugar, 35 grams of Carbohydrates, and 15 mg of sodium.  Whoa, Baby!  That's an awful lot packed into a little container.  I am by no means a health nut but I read labels and try to eat decent 90% of the time.  This drink is absolutely delicious, but it contains an awful lot of things that aren't friendly to my physique.  Because of that I probably won't be downing this product daily, but I might treat myself with it occasionally.<br /><br />Cherise Everhard, March 2008

review/summary: Good taste!
review/text: I really enjoyed the taste of this carbonated juice; to me, the carbonation level was just right because I don't prefer drinks to be terribly fizzy. Call me weird, but I'd also prefer artificial sweeteners so that a can could be larger, yet contain the same or fewer calories; the small can left me wanting more.

review/text: ...so I woke in the middle of the night with a case of hot coppers after a night of beer and Arby's spicy mozzarella sticks, stumbled to the refrigerator to relieve my parched mouth with something other than god-awful tap water, and found a can of Black Cherry Switch. I chugged the sucker down, and it was fine, relieving, maybe even refreshing. Picture a health conscious kiddie champagne for people who pretend they're doing anything about their diet and health.

review/summary: No nasty artificial anything!
review/text: I am not a soft drink person in fact I haven't had a soda drink in over 10 years. This was such a pleasant surprise I may have to rethink drinking soft drinks! This product does not contain added sugars of any kind or any nasty artificial sweetener or flavors. Just a nice lightly carbonated natural fruit surprise. The cherry flavor is natural and it tastes like it. There is also apple and grape juice in it for sweetness but the main flavor is cherry but not overwhelming, just right. I served it in a small wine glass it just seemed wrong to enjoy something so good out of a can. I bet this would be great in a mixed drink or even a little wine! Yeah, this is good stuff, wish the can was bigger!

review/text: I found this drink pleasant and reminded me of cherry soda that I used to love.  I love the fact that it is basically juice and sparkling water. I would recommend it to a friend.  However I didn't give it five stars because I found the can just to small. I was still thirsty after the drink, a regular soda can size would have been better.  Also although there is no sugar added you should remember that there is sugar in the fruit juice.  But over all a tasty little drink that I would have again.

review/summary: Better than the Orange-Tangerine version, but still a little too "tutti fruiti" for my taste
review/text: Here are a few things to know about this product before you buy:<br /><br />1) Flavor:  The flavor was pretty good (much better than the Orange-Tangerine flavor version of this product!).  The flavor was still a little too, um, tutti fruiti for my taste, not enough solid black cherry flavor for what I was expecting.<br /><br />2) Ingredients: When you check the ingredients you'll see that there is more apple and grape juice in this mix than there is cherry juice...thus the source of the tutti fruiti-ness.  But still a pleasant flavor.<br /><br />3) Not a sugar-free drink: While the manufacturer states that there is "no added sugar" that doesn't mean that this is a sugar-free drink, all that means is that there is no ADDED sugar.  This is not a diet drink, nor was it labeled as such, though the casual consumer might think that when they read the front of the can.  Since this is 100% fruit juice, you get the flavor and the sugar that's in 100% fruit juice.<br /><br />4) Calories/can: There are actually 130 calories/8.3 oz can.  That works out to 15.6 calories/oz.  If you compare that to a name-brand orange soda, you'll find that there are 190 calories in a 12 oz can of that, and that works out to 15.8 calories/oz.  That's not a significant difference.<br /><br />All in all I'd say that this has a pretty good flavor, but not as much cherry as I was expecting, and the other things I mentioned above lead me to award 3 stars.  OK, but not great.

review/summary: Great Concept, But Tastes Like You're Drinking a Vitamin
review/text: I really wanted to love Cherry Switch. I'm a big fan of cherry-flavored sodas and I like Switch's blend of natural juices, vitamin C, and filtered water. On paper, this seemed like the perfect beverage for me. In reality, it tasted like I was drinking a vitamin. You ever have one of those cherry-flavored acerola tablets? That's what drinking Cherry Switch is like.<br /><br />By no means if the beverage offensive; it's just not particularly tasty. I'll give it credit for being a natural product that offers vitamin C, but I'm dinging it for the taste. Would I got out of my way to buy this drink? Absolutely not. Would I buy it as an impulse purchase if I saw it at a deli? Maybe...but chances are, something else would get my attention.<br /><br />On another positive note, my wife liked the beverage because of its low carbonation. If regular soda is too bubbly for you then maybe you'll enjoy this product.

review/summary: Not Good-tasting or Nutritious enough to make me change
review/text: Disclaimer: This review is a result of Amazon's "Vine Voice" program, which means Amazon supplied me with a free can of Black Cherry Switch in exchange for this review.<br /><br />The Switch idea sounds pretty good.  Much of the world has been programmed to identify with carbonated beverages.  Instead of champagne or cola, "Switch" is fruit juice with "natural flavors" and "filtered sparkling water", with no additional syrups, sugar, preservatives, etc.<br /><br />If it were either much better tasting or much more nutritious or had much less calories than it's competition, Switch might be worth the buck a can price.  The taste isn't better than the local carbonated diet fruit-flavored drink that I can buy for $2 for 12.  If I throw in a vitamin C tablet or an orange into the daily diet, it's not more nutritious either.  The carbonation angle is only a plus for someone who thinks that a beverage can be a beverage if it's fizzie.<br /><br />The goal in the marketplace should be to make a better mousetrap or a less expensive one.  "Switch" fails both of these tests in my mind.

review/summary: Okay alternative to soda
review/text: I was intrigued by this Black Cherry carbonated 100% juice. I have to admit, on my first taste, I hated it. But I took a few more sips, I began to get used to it and like it a bit more. I could definitely taste the cherry in the drink and a hint of apple. Although, I'm not big on carbonated drinks that aren't soda. Also it may have a lot of pluses in what it doesn't put into your drink but if you're watching your calorie intake, The Switch Black Cherry has 130 calories and it's no different than what some soda and juice (like lemonade) have. It always seems slightly strange to me so I probably won't make a permanent switch to The Switch. The price of The Switch is another drawback. To me, $22.99 is a bit much for a 24 pack of 8.3 Ounce cans.

review/text: Good initial black cherry taste without the usual perfumey accents that are typically associated with this type of beverage.  The finish is something other than black cherry more like apple.  The bullet can design implies an energy drink which this is not.  Good carbonation, overall not a bad drink, just should have been in a larger can to fully quench your thirst.

review/text: It had a very sweet taste, but it seemed to be more of an apple flavor than cherry to me. It is a mixture of several fruit juices, not just cherry. The can is on the small side at just a little over 8 ounces. On the plus side it says it has no added corn syrup, but be aware that even though there is no corn syrup or added sugar, the label reads 33 g of sugar in this small 8.3 ounce can.  No preservatives could also be a definite plus for those looking to cut that out of their diet. The taste of the carbonated combination did not work for me, though.

review/summary: Is this what Black Cherry tastes like?
review/text: I realized today that I'm not sure what black cherry is supposed to taste like.  I've eaten lots of cherries in my day but I can't remember the last time I had a black cherry.  Now, I enjoy a can of black cherry soda, though, it's one of my favorite summertime picnic beverages.  But I'm willing to bet the flavor I associate with "black cherry" is some kind of frankenstein artificial flavoring skidoo unrelated to nature.<br /><br />Switch Black Cherry carbonated drink, however, is promoted as "100% Juice", no sugar added, and so on.  "A perfect balance between juice & carbonation".  130 calories in a skinny 8.3 oz can.  Ingredients: 100% juice defined as: filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, acerola and cherry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin c).<br /><br />I looked up "acerola", which is a kind of a (red) cherry.  I guess the "black" part of "black cherry" is grape and apple and "natural flavors". So: drinking this has not solved my "what's a black cherry REALLY taste like?" dilemma. Doh!<br /><br />I wonder how much vitamin C they had to add to get to 100% of your RDA, because this drink tastes just a little bit "vitaminy".<br /><br />It is, however, a more drinkable, less sickeningly sweet beverage than most of the usually artificially-flavored black cherry sodas I've had.  It's carbonated but I wouldn't call it the "perfect balance", it does indeed seem halfway between a cherry soda and a non-descript fruit juice drink.  I never knew I needed that option, but I guess it's nice to know it's out there in a handy little can!

review/summary: Not too shabby.....
review/text: I was expecting the Black Cherry SWITCH to taste more like Black Cherry, but a quick check of the ingredients shows that my taste buds were correct, it is, indeed, a mixture of Apple, Grape, and Cherry juice. The taste is pleasant enough, but I wish it had more Cherry juice thrown into the mix. As it stands, it tastes like a carbonated juice box. The can is small (8.3 FL OZ), and the calorie count is HIGH- 130 calories per serving! Also, the carbonation level isn't very high, so there's no real "fizz", like you'd get from a soda. With a little fine-tuning, they might have a winner here (Bigger can, lower price point, more Cherry juice, more carbonation); As it stands, it tastes like a semi-flat can of Seltzer with some Apple juice poured into it. Not bad, but I doubt I'd buy it again.

review/text: This product is very refreshing. It has the body of a pure, clear juice but the tingle of carbonation. It tastes distinctly like cherries and would be almost too sweet if it were not for the carbonation, which adds the needed tang. I really like it and am considering buying a case of 24. It's heartier than a fruit flavored carbonated water - which I cannot stand - but more interesting than plain juice. The cans are very small though, so be aware of this for the price. But then, you don't want to chug down 20 oz of juice at one shot anyway. Remember - this is pure juice.

review/summary: Juice with Zing!
review/text: I am a big fan of Black Cherry flavor, so I naturally enjoyed this. It was a little different than sodas of the same flavor. 'The Switch' actually tastes like juice. It is very nice to be able to drink it without the artificial sweeteners, and corn syrups. That was definitely pleasant.<br /><br />This drink is carbonated, which brings the juice to life! It is amazing what carbonation can do! However, I have to say, it is not overly carbonated like many sodas out there. It is very nicely carbonated so it gives the drink some zing, but doesn't leave you feeling like the bubbles are overwhelming the drink itself!<br /><br />The flavor and the drink itself are very good. However, the small cans (8.3 ounces each) seem a little small. I can see a small container for an energy or vitamin drink, but for a juice, it left me wanting a little more here. I certainly would have liked to have larger containers, rather than many small containers.<br /><br />If you like to drink juice, and don't like that sugary feeling afterwards, give this drink a try! Remember to take 2 cans with you!

review/summary: mildly carbonated, tastes more of apple than cherry
review/text: If you like apple juice, you will probably like Switch Black Cherry soda since the predominant flavor is that of apples.  A look at the ingredients reflects that it contains four juices: apple, grape, acerola, and cherry.  Since ingredients must be listed in descending order, it makes sense that this drink tastes more like apple than cherry.  The inclusion of acerola juice is good from a health standpoint since it is very high in vitamin C (one can of this stuff contains 100% of the USRDA of vitamin C), but apart from that this isn't a particularly healthy drink since it derives all of its calories from sugars.  It's certainly better than a high fructose corn sweetener produced soda, but it's still calorie rich.  Anyone who's concerned about his/her weight would be better to eat whole fruits instead of drinking fruit juice or sugar/HFCS sweetened sodas.<br /><br />I'll confess that I'm not a huge soda drinker nor a big juice drinker, so that might be coloring my perception of this beverage.  Still, I found it disappointing that the flavor was basically that of weak apple juice and the carbonation was extremely mild.<br /><br />ADDITION ON 4/9/09:<br /><br />I just looked at some of the other reviews of this product and am perplexed.  How can some people find this beverage to have a strong cherry flavor when others like myself barely taste the cherry?  I can understand different people rating the level of sweetness differently, but the variance in the perception of the fruit flavor has me wondering whether the manufacturer has shipped this product out using more than one formula.

review/text: My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me a bit of the "Shasta Black Cherry" soda that I drank occasionally as a kid, although nowhere near as carbonated. Unlike the "Shasta Black Cherry," this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 130 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product.<br /><br />If they created 12 ounce cans and lowered the price, then I would be more apt to purchase this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series.

review/summary: Not enough Black Cherry, too much filler juices
review/text: The initial taste does hint of black cherry, but then the apple and grape juice filler comes to fore and dominates the after-taste.  It has a slight metallic taste and is not very pleasant.  The carbonation offers no benefit in the taste or feel category.  The price is high - about $1 per 8 oz can.  If I want juice, I'll stick with real juice without the carbonation.

review/summary: A healthy and refreshing drink
review/text: This drink packs a taste wallop, which continues some time after you have swallowed the last drop. Furthermore, there is no unpleasant aftertaste, what you feel at the beginning is what you taste at the end. The taste is also a good one, the apple, grape, acerola and cherry juices in combination with the carbonated water really activates the taste buds. I also found it refreshing with no sugar or caffeine buzz arriving a few minutes after I consumed it. A healthy drink, I will continue to drink it in the future.

review/summary: It's OK
review/text: Thankfully this wasn't too sweet. I was afraid that it might be, but found it to have an ok cherry flavor. Not sure if it's something I would drink on a regular basis since I'm not a fan of fruit flavored sodas.

review/summary: Good Cherry Flavor-Not Too Sweet
review/text: What more to say? I get nauseated by the excessive corn syrup sweetness of most fruit drinks or juices. This one has just the right amount of sweetness, and the package says it is natural. I think the small size is just the right amount to drink and would be perfect for a mixer.

review/summary: Pleasant light fizz
review/text: Light fizz, cherry taste, no sugar, juice drink.  Much better idea than sugary drinks and the carbonation is lighter than colas.  If you like carbonation cherry but want no added sugar, this is the one for you.  Its got a nice sparkle without overdoing it.  Conventient little cans, though I can see these drinks being served in champaigne glasses for some elegance.

review/summary: good- VERY cherry!
review/text: I like the fact this is an all-natural product. The things on the label are things you recognize. No high fructose corn syrup here!<br /><br />For those watching their weight- its not too bad. About 130 calories, or, I think, 3 WW points.<br /><br />Taste-wise its a real punch. VERY black cherry flavor- not dull at all. I'm kind of on the fence on how I like black cherry but I liked this. A bubbly soda that's actually pretty healthy!

review/summary: Just "okay"
review/text: When I first ordered Switch, I was looking forward to something that was light, refreshing and tasted like black cherry.  Perhaps I am use to the taste of black cherry soda?  I am not sure about that, but I am sure that it didn't taste like black cherry.  It was just "okay".  I wasn't thrilled about the product, but I also wouldn't go out of my way to tell people that I don't like it.  Bottom line, I would not order it again, but I would try another flavor. The idea is there!  I'm curious to see if the flavor is!

review/summary: Okay, But Could Have Better Taste (Rating: 7 out of 10- -3.5 stars)
review/text: I ordered this soda off Amazon Vine, and thought it was a very decent drink. If you ever had the soda Big Red, the black cherry flavor of The Switch tastes almost identical to it. Also what is the point of having a skinny can, resembling an energy drink?<br /><br />Overall, a decent drink. I guess if you're curious, then to try this soda. There are quite a few flavors out there, so try as many as possible. Peace.

review/summary: Alternative to regular carbonated drinks
review/text: Got this for my 25 year old son, since he is a bit of a health food nut and a daily runner. Thought that the ingredients in it would be good for his stamina and that it would make a good alternative to other drinks. Although the drink's flavor was 'ok', didn't taste much like black cherry according to him, my son didn't think that it did much to improve his stamina or healthy lifestyle. You see, he takes daily supplements in his diet and drinks gallons of water a day, so to him this 'too sweet' alternative, although tasty, was really not necessary. I guess if you have someone (or yourself) who is looking for an alternative to carbonated beverages, or even the calorie-ridden gatorade drinks, this might work for you. To me, the best part of buying stuff like this on Amazon is the Prime shipping and the fact that I don't have to be carting home the stuff from the supermarket. I will most likely buy a case in another flavor just to try again.

review/summary: Delicious carbonated beverage without harmful ingredients
review/text: I love this drink.  It has the taste of soda, sweet and carbonated, but the only ingredients are carbonated water, 100% juice, natural flavors and vitamin C.  The 8.3 ounce serving size is perfect to go with a meal or just as a thirst-quencher. The shape of the can, long and tall, is easy to hold.<br /><br />Parents whose kids clamor for soda might find this product a good substitute.  It's also great for adults who crave the carbonation, but not the preservatives.

review/summary: Bubbly Fruit Juice
review/text: Nice smooth taste, even with the carbonation.  It DOES taste like cherry juice.  Light in color.  The can says it is 100% juice--no sugar added and no preservatives--100% RDA vitamin C--all natural, no artificial colors and gluten free.  (Gluten free is a big deal to those with gluten intolerance, like one of my girlfriends.) 8.3 fl oz  can/245 ml.  Calories in the entire can 130.  Sodium 15mg, carbs 35mg, sugars 33g.  As you know, there is a certain amount of natural sugar in fruits anyway.  Ingredients (in order listed) are:100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates), apple, grape, acerola and cherry juice concentrates, natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C).<br /><br />Quite a nice taste and I am pretty picky.  I don't generally drink sodas or any carbonated beverages any more.  I try to consume mostly healthy products. This is really pretty good tasting and a decent alternative to a soda, especially for a child's lunchbox.  It actually seems to taste even better as you drink more of it, too. It's not a big can but it's big enough.  I certainly recommend it.  By the way, it's a pop top (like a beer)--schnik!--fizz. (Then you can give the little aluminum pop thingie to whoever's child is collecting them for school and recycle the rest of the aluminum can.--Just a little trivia: I toured an aluminum plant a couple of years ago.  Did you know they can recycle that can forever?)

review/summary: If I drank more soda, I'd definitely make the Switch!
review/text: This is my 3rd Switch review, after trying the Watermelon Strawberry and the Kiwi Berry.  I'm a fan of all of them.  The Black Cherry is the one that tastes most like other "normal" sodas, so if you're looking for a taste you recognize, this is it.  The taste is definitely more cherryish than some of the artificial flavored sodas you'll find in supermarkets.  On the whole, it's definitely tasty.<br /><br />As with all the Switch beverages, I find the carbonation to be very pleasant: small bubbles that don't lead to an unpleasant feeling of "gassiness."<br /><br />I'm sure a bunch of other reviews have pointed out that the description of "just juice and bubbles" isn't quite correct: it's juice, bubbles, and a whole lot of natural sweeteners.  I'm not ready to have this replace water, milk, or juicy juice on the list of things I'd rather my (future) children drink...  but if it's a choice between this and soda?  This is definitely the lesser evil.  It's nice to have as an alternative.

review/summary: Tastes like Libby's Juice + Carbonation
review/text: The product itself was OK, and the description was exactly correct.<br /><br />The Switch "Black Cherry" flavor tastes like someone took a small amount of Libby 100% juice cherry cocktail, mixed half of it with white grape juice, then added carbonated water.  It was a little overly sweet for a soda that has no added sugar in it, had a very "white grape" or "apple" juice-filler taste to it, and was middling on the cherry flavor.  However, this is not intended to denigrate Libby's juice, because I would prefer just a regular uncarbonated juice over The Switch.<br /><br />In comparison with other higher-end sodas, the Switch tastes a lot like Izze but the flavors aren't quite as well-blended (Izze's Blackberry tastes a little like carbonated jell-o in a can, and The Switch is more of the same).  It is just as overly sweet taste of Jones' soda, so if you are a fan of either of the above, you might like this.  If you enjoy lighter-tasting sodas like Hint or Dry soda, you'll probably want to stay away from this particular soda, as it can be a bit overwhelming.  I would probably not purchase this product again. Although it was not much better or worse than Izze or Jones soda, it was still a bit too sweet for me.

review/summary: carbonated marachino cherry juice
review/text: Very sweet, very expensive, full of sugar despite the misleading hype on the can.  The cherry flavor is pretty good if you like the taste of marachino cherry juice (you know: like drinking the juice out of a jar of marachino cherries) I would only buy this if it were DRASTICALLY reduced in price and then use it as a flavoring in other drinks or recipies where some marachino cherry juice and carbonation might add something.

review/summary: Like a lightly carbonated kid's juice box
review/text: This is marketed as healthy all natural all juice.  From the full nutrition label, Switch lives up to that claim.  The ingredients are juice caoncentrates and added vitamin C.  No added sugar.  Just like juice, you get fruit sugar and fruit nutrients, but none of the fiber.  That's to be expected from a juice, although it seems some other reviewers were alarmed to discover that fruit is sweet due to sugar rather than naturally growing aspartame or sucrose.  Healthwise, this seems fine to me.<br /><br />As to taste:  I was expecting "Black Cherry" in a dark red can to be strong.  This was mellow.  I could taste the cherry juice, but I think apple was the dominant flavor.  This tasted remarkably like a children's juice box or a capri sun baggie, probably because it's a mix of juices in which apple is prominent.  It tasted like real juice - not fake.<br /><br />The carbonation was light, and added a bit of texture.  At home, purchasing fruit juice in a bottle and seltzer water in a bottle and mixing them in a glass provides more options and a taste of carbonated fruit juice.  I used to do lots of carbonated fruit juice mixes, and think I prefer plain apple juice and seltzer water to this, mostly because the Switch flavor didn't strike me.  Which juice sits best with you will be a matter of taste, and if you like carbonated fruit juice, then this could be a way to make it portable for bag lunches, road trips, and such.<br /><br />Overall, if you drink a lot of sodas and like fruit juice, this is worth a try, perhaps in the form of one can on a road trip.  It's healthier than soda, because it has real sugar (from fruit, not added) instead of high fructose corn syrup, but not as healthy as a piece of fruit.<br /><br />Oh, yes, here is the nutritional information:<br />8.3 oz.,  130 calories, 0g fat, 15mg sodium, 35g total carb, 33g sugar, 0g protein, 100% of vitamin C.<br />Ingredients:  100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, acerola and cherry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acis (Vitamin C)

review/text: Each of these Switch juice drinks seems to be about 50 percent sweeter than it needs to be. Imagine mixing Perrier, Kool-Aid and Mountain Dew together and you've got a good idea what to expect. OK, I know it's not that bad. But would somebody please tell my taste buds?
