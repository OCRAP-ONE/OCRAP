review/summary: Real vanilla bean flavor with the convenience of vanilla extract.
review/text: I LOVE this stuff! It is so handy and goes a long way. It has a syrupy consistency and is packed with vanilla bean caviar. This gives your food that extra special gourmet taste. I love putting it in whipped cream, frosting, icing, cakes and scones. It would be great anywheree you use vanilla extract or vanilla beans. If you like to make desserts, you really need to try this!

review/summary: Vanilla Syrup
review/text: DESCRIPTION<br />The product is actually a mostly-sugar syrup with black specks of ground vanilla beans.  I expected a more intensely "vanilla" product than "extract", but the "paste" is actually less intense.<br /><br />EQUIVALENCES<br />According to the label: "1 Tbs. vanilla paste = 1 Tbs. vanilla extract = 1 vanilla bean".  In reality, my guess is that the paste is about half the strength of "extract".  Caveat, the alchohol in vanilla extract is probably a substantial portion of the vanilla-ish flavor in "extract".<br /><br />USING<br />Like any syrup, it is slow to mix with cold ingredients or in cold water.  It generally requires warming or vigourous mixing to mix uniformly.<br /><br />COMPARISON TO "EXTRACT"<br />> "Extract" is vanilla flavor in alchohol. "Paste" is ground vanilla in sugar syrup. In my limited experience, "extract" is more intensely "vanilla" but the alcohol flavor interferes with use in uncooked (or lightly cooked) desserts---for example, in home-made ice-cream, or in a glass of vanilla-milk, or pudding.<br />Example: I make a faux-chocolate pudding with a tropical fruit called "black sapote", milk, Knox Gelatin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQTD2">Knox Original Gelatin (32-Count Envelopes), Unflavored, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, sugar, and vanilla (extract).  I've always used Massey vanilla extract, but the alchohol flavor detracts from the chocolate flavor.  I look foward to trying the paste for this purpose.<br />> The "paste" has the advantage of not evaporating (which can happen to extract kept for a year or two).<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION<br />Use "extract" for deserts which will be substantially cooked (enough to drive the alchohol off).  Use "paste" for uncooked (or lightly cooked) deserts.

review/text: I should have read the one star review first and then Googled it to verify. Normally I do, but this time I just bought it on a whim. I was hoping for just ground up vanilla bean, but this is all sugar. Actual vanilla bean is the 2nd to last ingredient. Really not thrilled and I wish I could send it back.

review/summary: Vanilla Magic
review/text: Love this brand.  I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GE8N4Y">Nielsen-Massey 32 oz. Madagascar Bourbon Pure Vanilla Extract.</a> also (32 oz. seems like a  lot but it calculates to roughly a little over $1.20 per ounce.  Um, CRAZY SAVINGS.).<br /><br />You can use this as a substitute for vanilla beans for the most part but if you use this with extract you can punch up the vanilla flavor to a sinful degree.  I love using this to make vanilla bean frosting (via a Cupcake Project recipe) that tastes like vanilla bean ice cream.<br /><br />Whoever said vanilla was boring?!  ;D

review/text: I really like this stuff. I got it for Christmas for a friend and use it all the time. I like it because you can use it in recipes that call for either vanilla extract or vanilla beans (it has a guide on how much to use on the back). I think it would make a really great gift for anyone who likes to bake.

review/summary: Makes everything better
review/text: I used this extensively in baking. My cookies are incredibly better with this stuff. It's very addicting. I mostly made cookies with this substituted for vanilla extract. They tasted better and people would gobble them up. I also added it  to French Toast. That was incredible too. This lasted me about 3 months with baking every week or every other week. I plan on buying it again but buying a much bigger container this time. If you are hesitant about this, I would recommend trying it. I ran out and don't like to eat my cookies as much without it. Just a fantastic product.

review/text: This is the best vanilla you will ever use.  Say good-bye to alcohol-based vanilla and hello to this thick, delightful paste.  An even exchange for vanilla extract in recipes but a much truer vanilla flavor.  Be aware, however, that the vanilla bean specks will show in foods like shortbread cookies - I like the look but, for some, it might take getting time to get use to.

review/summary: A No-Brainer - Buy this NOW!
review/text: This is the product that you've been searching for all of your baking life that you didn't know you wanted. I love that it doesn't have that strong alcohol bite. I love that it is a strong (but not too strong) punch of vanilla.<br /><br />I've used it in cookies, and it added a deep vanilla flavor. I have used it in my Zoku to make Vanilla Latte bars - excellent! I like this product so much that I ~almost~ added it to mashed potatoes last night (and no, I am not pregnant). I have added a thin film to a PB&banana and thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />I will never buy vanilla extract again. The magic of this product is, that unlike extract, you don't have to add heat, cook, bake to get it to taste yummy (with extract you have to burn off the alcohol). I estimate with weekly use this jar will last me for nearly a year. I only wish this product were the standard years ago and we all learned to make Toll House cookies with this instead of vanilla extract.

Suggested conversion from liquid vanilla is exactly the same (1 tsp liquid vanilla to 1 tsp vanilla bean paste) which I did for a favorite cheesecake squares recipe and it was too much.

This one contained more sugar syrup than it did the vanilla bean/vb flavor; and I also noticed a clear visable difference as well in my frosting/batter...requiring so much more and not as many vb specks, greatly altering my end product.  disappointed.

review/text: i really wanted to like this. i'm a baker and always looking for new better ways to get vanilla and this seemed amazing. i was really disappointed. its like a sugary syrup with a very faint vanilla taste. ever used pure vanilla bean? the vanilla taste should be intense. this wasn't. i also tried buying vanilla powder from williams sanoma and that was even a bigger waste of money. omg it was like they just ground up the peels or something because it had NO flavor and hardly any smell. what a disappointment. so i continue on my search. i saw this website called Vanilla Man that i want to check out. He's in Africa i think. so i'm hoping that will be the real deal. he has vanilla syrups, powders and grinders. so we'll see. could be another waste of money. but i'm always trying till i find something good.

review/text: This was some of the best tea I've ever purchased! I'm usually pretty loyal to green tea or peppermint but the detox was wonderful. It wasn't bitter and the flavor wasn't overpowering. I've already reccommend this to many of my college friends after long weekends.

review/text: This blood orange pur&eacute;e is all the rage in my home town! I ordered 3 and then defrosted one of the jars and poured them into little containers to freeze.  (My friend told me to do this) This Pur&eacute;e makes the best margaritas!  Fill a pitcher with ice...pour 1/3 tequila (or less)...2/3 Margarita mix and enough pur&eacute;e to make it a nice sunset color..and voila... adjust to your taste. It is not too sweet for some reason...just perfect and  A HUGE HIT!!!  Everyone wants to know "what is that..it is perfect....where did you get that!!!"  The shipping is expensive..but it arrives totally frozen in dry ice...and is sooooo worth it!!! Seriously!! It would make a great hostess gift also!!<br /><br />YUMMY!!! (do not drink and drive!)

review/text: Due to the horrendous shipping charges (which I can't really knock them for since I knew about it before ordering) I naturally ordered 3 pur&eacute;es.<br /><br />Passion fruit, prickly pear, and blood orange. Blood orange was my last choice, and they were all to make margaritas and other smoothies.<br /><br />But after sampling them all, we LOVE the blood orange. Perfectly balanced between citrus and sweet. The one thing they all have in common is that these pur&eacute;es smell and taste like we are eating fresh picked fruit. Amazing.

review/text: Going over my list of baking recipes for this Xmas season, I came across a recipe that specifically asked for caster sugar.  Since I was making this recipe for the first time I purchased the caster sugar.  At around $4.50/lb it is very pricey for a sugar product.  Further research at cooking websites and blogs, I found that many people use regular granulated sugar with acceptable results.

review/text: I used to buy Godiva chocolates for friends as gifts. Whe I lived in S.F. I took the bus to get to their downtown store.<br />I used to think that Godiva was the BEST chocolate ever, that is until I found out that they use gmos in their candy, because its cheap. Why am I paying a premium price for sub standard candy?  Hersheys uses gmos; the very same stuff Godiva uses. I expect that from Hersheys. Their candy bars are 75 cents compared to Godiva at $3.oo!<br /><br />What a ripoff! Shame on you Godiva!  I already found a better chocolate to replace you and its cheaper and tastes better!<br />They are called Theo Chocolate Company and are NON-GMo vefified.

review/summary: Doesn't Taste Like French Roast
review/text: While I am not a coffee expert, I appreciate French roast coffee.  Upon opening the bag, it was apparent that the coffee did not look like French roast as it had brownish hues, not black, and it did not have an oily sheen.  I made the coffee in a French press and my observation was confirmed, it did not have a French roast flavor.<br /><br />On a positive side, the coffee was well packed in resealable bags for those who don't have, or choose not to use, airtight containers.  The coffee was not bad, it simply was not what I expected.

review/summary: Almost the Real Thing
review/text: After downing mass quantities of full-bore French Roast for years and years, I suddenly couldn't handle the caffeine and embarked on a search to find a decaf simulacrum of the real thing. It's never been clear to me if the process of decaffeination is responsible for the insipid flavor of much decaf coffee or if the roasters conclude that anyone drinking decaf is a weenie and doesn't deserve and would not appreciate a robust brew. Anyway, finding something with flavor at an affordable price point is a real struggle. We're on our third three-bag round of Coffee Bean Direct, and are really happy with it.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent. The coffee comes in a plain brown wrapper, as should all decaf. I have never mastered the skills necessary for resealing the tin ties on conventional bags, particularly near the end of the bag, and find that Coffee Direct's integrated zipper seal secure and easy to use for the life of the bag. Sucking down decaf is bad enough without feeling mechanically challenged as well.

review/summary: Very pleased. One lingering question. . .
review/text: I've purchased coffee from Coffee Bean Direct for several years. I have never been displeased. I always get it shortly after it has been roasted and usually buy multiple bags since shipping is a large portion of the cost. That made this 3-pack of 1# bags nice, and going the subscription made it even better ($29 vs $46) delivered.<br /><br />The bags seem top quality, especially in comparison to some premium brands. They also were properly evacuated.<br /><br />All the Coffee Bean Direct products I've bought had a roast date label. Two of the bags I received had the label removed completely (but it was apparent, and one had part of it removed. It appeared to still be 2011 roasted, but would still like the label left in place. It is sort of like getting any other consumable and having the "Best by" date obliterated.<br /><br />That said, I served this Friday evening to friends who are very in-tune with highest quality coffee and espresso. They loved this coffee, as did I, and are ordering it. They have been buying locally from a name brand store known for "charring" their beans :-)

review/text: I often pick up an evening meal at my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and when I do I often select a beverage to go along with the meal. I might add that I enjoy trying things I've never had before. This time the beverage was Honest Tea / Honey Green Tea in a 16.9-ounce bottle. Please notice that my review is for the tea only. Whatever the cost per bottle is and the shipping costs are your own personal business. Personally, I don't buy heavy things like this that can be easily found nearby, but that may not apply to all people.<br /><br />This Honey Green Tea is quite good. Excellent! It has a very light  and pleasant green-tea taste and is just a tad sweet with honey, as they claim. It goes down real easily, believe me. I think I could pull down a whole bottle in one long swig, if I wanted to. But I enjoy sipping it in small amounts and savoring the excellent taste.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

You get one - one 6 inch stick despite the fact that the product name and picture implies that there are more.<br /><br />Combined with the shipping cost, it's kind of a ripoff for just one stick.

review/text: I'm writing this review, however, if my dog could write it, or say it, she would positively rave about this treat! I have a 6-year-old Bichon Frise who loves these dog biscuits - or as she knows them, "cookies"!  She loves the flavor of peanut butter, which is why I bought these originally to try. However, I was pleased to know that the other ingredients in these dog biscuits are oatmeal, eggs, apples and carrots and that everything is made natural. I want my dog to have good snacks (and food!) - and I want her to enjoy what she's eating, too. I have made my third purchase of this product as she loves them - she never hesitates to gobble the "cookie" quickly. She loves them and I know they're good for her - we're both happy! And to top it all off - the price is definitely right! I buy the mini-size as my dog is small. I highly recommend this high-quality dog treat!

review/text: I don't drink soda, but somehow I got suckered into trying this, and now I am seriously addicted.  It is a little bitter, not too sweet, not too bubbly and unfortunately 130 calories a can.  I buy it at Costco (sorry Amazon) where I get a case of 12 orange and 12 lemon for $14.00.  I like the orange better than the lemon, but somehow, I am still buying a case every 2 weeks.  I am just weak.

review/summary: truly superb -- very thirstquenching and not too sweet
review/text: Stack up on this drink -- especially on hot summer days.  It is something you will need and need more of.  I haven't used it with any booze, but I'll bet you could mix some interesting drinks with it -- a kind of mildly flavored, not too sweet, just a soupcon of bitterness with the sweet and sparkle.  Very Very refreshing

review/summary: Try an Orange Comfort
review/text: I love this beverage because of the slight bitter taste.  It's an adult orange soda that I would not have liked as a kid.  Yesterday, I bought some egg nog at Safeway, and they had some cold bottles of Southern Comfort alongside the egg nog (smart cross-sell).  I bought both (sucker).  Frankly, I didn't like the taste of the Southern Comfort in the egg nog.  Today, I tried a little Southern Comfort straight up, but found the smell and taste, slightly peachy or bubble gum - not grossly so, but too sweet.  I did a review on the Southern Comfort and others also describe the peach aroma and taste.  I probably would not buy Southern Comfort again.  Then it struck me that it might go well with the San Pellegrino Aranciata in my refer (kind of like a fuzzy navel).  Of course, often an idea doesn't play out that well.  I poured about 1 ounce of Southern Comfort onto the ice in a cognac glass and then added 2 ounces of the San Pellegrino Aranciata.  It smells very nice, tastes delicious, and the bitter of the orange peel balances out the sweetness of the peach in the Comfort - it's much more subtle and drinkable than a typically syrupy sweet fuzzy navel - a more sophisticated version.  This is a great all-season sexy drink that everyone will like.  My only caution would be that it tastes too good and goes down way too easily.  I was playing with a name for this drink:  Southern Italian, Southern Gina... Orange Comfort!  Anyway, with or without the alcohol, I love San Pellegrino Aranciata, and I now have a reason to buy more Southern Comfort.

review/summary: refreshing
review/text: These used to be hard to find but is getting more available now. It is an Italian gourmet item with a gourment price, long a staple of Italian resteraunts and other resteraunts. San Pellegrino mineral water is very refreshing and comes in Lime, Lemon, orange, natural springwater, and other flavors. The variety shown here is orange. It it has real orange juice mixed in and tastes very fresh, and it includes a light amount of pulp. It is not overpowered with too much lemon or tons of sweetener like a soda, but very balanced. The spring water used in this makes it have a natural carbonation, similar in fizz to a soda. The unflavored variety is too bitter for some people, more an acquired taste. The lemon, orange, and my personal favorite lime, are good on the first sip. I reccommend the glass bottle over the cans. I prefer Orangina from France to this orange by a very slight margin, but it is very, very good.

So, we will stick with the Itty Bitty product but never again order the Sweet Potato flavor.

review/text: My dogs are all on very limited ingredient diets, and the Itty Bitty Buddy Biscuits Sweet Potato flavor perfectly compliments what we are feeding all of them. Most importantly, my dogs LOVED these cute little treats! They fit perfectly in a treat dispensing toy, and tend to stay in longer than the other treats I have used due to their odd shape. I have not had any issues with crumbled cookies in any of my purchases, and I buy these on the regular!<br /><br />Our cupboards are only lined with Cloud Star treats (all are corn and soy free, and made with only USA-made/sourced ingredients). This company gives back too - they supported my local shelter with samples and free goods for a recent fundraiser. Can't say enough great things about Cloud Star and their amazing line of yummy treats!

review/summary: The best for decaf iced tea!
review/text: If you're at all familiar with the south you'll know that we tend to take iced tea rather seriously.  When I was growing up my mother made iced tea from Lipton tea bags but when I discovered Luzianne tea there was no going back to Lipton!  Formulated specifically for making iced tea Luzianne delivers a consistent product that is not bitter and has a pleasant aroma.  These days I use one regular tea bag along with one Luzianne decaf tea bag to make our iced tea in this manner:<br /><br />Steep a quart to a quart and a half of water almost to boiling.  You don't want to use boiling water as it will singe the tea and create a bitter flavor.  As long as the heated water is steaming, it's hot enough.  Add 1 family sized (or 2 regular sized bags) of each variety of Luzianne tea (caffeinated and decaffeinated) to the water and allow it to steep all day and come to room temperature.  If you're making sweet tea add the sugar to the bottom of the pitcher before adding any liquid.  Then add about 2 cups of the room temperature (or warm) tea and stir to dissolve all the sugar.  At this point, fill the pitcher with ice.  Pour the brewed tea on top of the ice and stir gently to combine.  Add water as needed to fill your vessel.  Your tea will be clear, sweet and refreshing with no bitterness or after-taste!

review/summary: Not So Decent -- but there is better!
review/text: UPDATE: I can't drink this stuff! I have tried to bear it but the more I drink it the worst it tastes. Please don't buy if you're sensitive to flavor (for example, if you know for a fact that Starbuck's green tea frappuccinos are better than Jamba's slimy MATCHA shakes, hehe).<br /><br />I don't like the fact that this product has sugar and other stuff mixed in it already because I have to use more to get the flavor I like which by then it is too sweet! It also makes me feel like they are selling me just a little bit of MATCHA with glorified sugar, I can always add my own sugar. The packaging is very unprofessional too, its kind of scary buying food items with unprofessional packaging and labels that look printed at home. For the price, taste, and value I would be better off simply going to the local Japanese food supply shops and picking up little jars of MATCHA. It has been a horrible waste since we don't touch this stuff anymore.

review/summary: Really good - nice sub for Starbucks
review/text: This is really really good.  At first I was looking for anything close to Starbucks, after reading MANY different Matcha product reviews I decided to try this one.  I must say I am shocked at how good it is...I also purchased the Starbucks sugar-free syrup from my local Target store so it taste just like it.  I have a Non-fat Green Tea Frapp every other day now!  I wish to control the sugar a bit more...so next time I will try the sugar free version that this company offers since I was disappointed that the packaging had no nutrition labeling like other matcha products.  I for one would like to know just how much sugar is in each serving...even their website doesn't state it which makes me worry since diabetes run in my family.  Overall a great product if you are looking for a quick Starbucks fix at a fraction of the cost. I just wish they listed nutritional values...it's so good, it's easy to go over board and have two a day without realizing how many calories and sugar you in taking in.

I made mine with soy milk and a hint of heavy cream to liven it up, and honestly a little goes a long way. The recipe called for 4 tbps of powder, I used 3 and found it to be a little too sweet for me, next time I think I will just use 2 and it should be fine.
