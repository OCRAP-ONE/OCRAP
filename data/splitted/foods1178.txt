review/text: Stale.... Stale.... Stale.....  Stay away from this seller!  The candy was stale, melted, discolored and tasted terrible.  I had to throw 80% of this candy out.  When I contacted Candy Crate, they wanted the candy sent back.  I have never been asked to send food back before. How do you send back opened food???  and what do they do with the returned candy?  Maybe this is why my candy was so bad!!!!  They refused any type of satisfaction to me.  Also Amazon did NOT back me with their A to Z Guarantee.  First time Amazon has not come through for me.  I am a long time customer that will have to consider this before I use Amazon again.  Dissapointed in both Candy Crate and Amazon!!!!!

review/summary: Your Basic Zip Top Bag
review/text: I may not be the best person to review these, because I bought them for general use, not food products.  The reason I got them from this supplier is because other bags of this size could only be purchased in much larger quantities.  As far as quality, these are fine for what I need.  Nothing amazing, but they live up to what is advertized.

review/summary: very high quality
review/text: Having tried the hard red from Great River Organic for my breads, I was a convert.  I live in the city but grind my own grain, and there is a noticeable difference in the flavor/ results of the recipes made from the fresh flour. I highly recommend this soft white winter wheat for your tender crumb recipes such as pie crusts, waffles or cakes, or any recipe where you want to minimize the "chew" factor you would get from higher protein flours.  The wheat berries of this brand and soft white type are light in color, fat, and rounder than the harder, higher protein grains more typically used for breads, and make for an exceptionally light and fine flour, such as another reviewer noted--i'd say nearly like talcum powder!! pretty amazing.  i'm so impressed by this company's great products, and the quality (very very clean- no chaff, small rocks or other debris to sort through) and cost (by mail) is better than other like brands i've purchased in the past.  If you live near a wheat farm, you can do much better in price, obviously, because shipping is a bear. But, this is lower or equivalent in cost to the main brands that provide small (25 or 50 lb) quantities to individual consumers, and the quality is better!  --very highly recommended product.  i'm so glad Great River sells on Amazon.

review/summary: Fresh Whole Grains for Baking
review/text: What a bargain! Organic, fresh whole wheat, a soft white winter wheat that's perfect for all your pastries, pies and cakes, doughnuts, cookies and cupcakes. Using fresh whole grains is the best thing you can do for yourself and your family. That it's organically grown wheat, this boosts the health-o-meter factor way up through the roof. This grain produces such fine flour that you'll never go back to bagged, store-bought flour again. Seriously. Using the Blendtec grain mill to mill the wheat into flour is a breeze and a snap. If the power goes out, my Victorio's manual grain mill will work just fine. I'm planning on purchasing another 50lb bag of this soft white winter wheat to compliment my 100lbs of hard red spring wheat and my 100lbs of hard white winter wheat, all organic of course, and all from Grear River Millings Co, via Amazon.

review/summary: Sampler?
review/text: I was really looking forward to receiving a sample of jerky to try. However, of the 10 items five were antelope sticks and two were ostrich sticks. So for 10 possible different flavors I only received five and 50% was one flavor.  Furthermore they were all date stamped before the date I ordered. I certainly hope that is not a sell by date.  This is not what I expected.

review/summary: Not fit for human consumption.
review/text: I was very excited when i saw this product, i'm one of those people eager to try anything, and I've had exotic meats before in a number of ways, through friends that hunt I've enjoyed home made dishes made from a wide variety of game animals, and i've had less common animals like ostrich, kangaroo, and aligator that i ordered on like and cooked myself, and i've even had a few of these meats as jerky by other companies. I like the meats of the animals they made these jerkies from, i need to stress that point, because otherwise you may think that is what my problem is. it's not, this product was AWFUL!! these were some of the worst cured meat snacks I've ever had.  Is it possible to rate something and give it no stars? because that is what this product deserves. the meat managed somehow to be both bland and surprisingly foul, and coated with enough grease to lubricate an engine. I have tried several of the strips and sticks and found that to be a universal condition. I can only think that the people who wrote the rave reviews for this product did so without tasting it. this is dreadful stuff, suited only for those who simply want the novelty of claiming they ate strange animals and don't care what it tasted like. this meat was not fit for human consumption, in fact, i wouldn't even give it to my dog. I won't be buying anything else from buffalo bob.

review/text: I bought these for my boyfriend as part of his easter basket. I was hoping the variety would at least be close to what is shown, but it was lacking in aligator, had several doubles and once you look closely reads made with BEEF on almost all of them. So you aren't truly getting exotic jerky.<br /><br />I was displeased, but being the meat eating boy he is, HE LOVED THEM. Mentioned the spicy ones are SPICY though.<br /><br />He enjoyed them, but I don't think they were worth the price.

review/summary: Tasty - But for the adventurous
review/text: I figured I'd try this sampler pack after browsing around Amazon and coming across this product, and noting that there are varieties offered that aren't available from other retailers(duck, pheasant, antelope).  Unfortunately since they do note that what you receive from them is completely random, as you can guess I did not receive any of those.<br /><br />However, I did receive a good variety of different jerky and beef sticks that I can say that I enjoyed - for Jerky I received Wild Boar, Kangaroo, Alligator, Buffalo, and Elk.  For sticks I received Alligator, Elk, Wild Boar, Ostrich and Buffalo.  Each animal has their own unique flavor that you won't quite find anywhere else.<br /><br />Each of the regular sticks have a tendency to be a much sweeter flavor, while the jerky tends to have a flatter, more savory flavor.  I enjoyed the sticks more than the jerky due to that, but your mileage may vary.  The peppered variety forgoes the sweetness in flavor of a palpable peppery taste(especially if you bite into a peppercorn), so people who like a lot of pepper in their food would enjoy this.<br /><br />Be aware that spicy means *spicy*, and if you are turned off by spicy foods, I would suggest giving those to someone who likes spicy things without even opening the wrapper.<br /><br />All-in-all they were tasty, and are worth a buy if you want something 'a little different'.

It sat on the shelf for months and one day I was hungry for a bologna sandwich. For some odd reason I decided to put this on my sandwich and it was so good. When I finished off that jar (all by myself) I searched the grocery stores for it and found it nowhere. Yes, I had to buy 4 bottles of it to get it on Amazon, but that's ok, they won't go to waste!

review/text: Tangy and flavorful, this mustard beats any other I have tried, and I am a stone-ground mustard enthusiast. Great big mustard seeds lend a satisfying pop to the mustard. It has no harsh radishy heat, as many dijon-style mustards do. Just a balanced and satisfying mustard flavor. It's great as a base for vinaigrettes, or you can add it to pan sauces for chicken. Great on sandwiches or sausages. Produced by a sweet little company in Oregon. And it's vegan! I always add a 6pack of these to orders that are under $25 to qualify them for free shipping!

review/summary: Very tasty, and love the stone ground mustard seeds in it
review/text: I've bought this mustard at the grocery store a time or two, but the six pack I got here on Amazon with free SuperSaver shipping (on orders over $25) made it a much better deal.  We use lots of mustard since I pack lunches for 5-6 people every day.  I like to get different mustards and spreads to keep things interesting, and we're all fans of stone ground mustard.<br /><br />Inglehoffer stone ground mustard has a very nice flavor and texture. My kids, who don't like "spicy" Dijon mustard like this one too.  I like the squeeze bottle for ease of use, and because it's chunky you can stand the bottle on its head and it all oozes to the bottom/top so none is wasted.<br /><br />I like that the ingredients are pretty natural - water, mustard seed, vinegars, sugar, salt, white wine, garlic and spices, xanthan gum, turmeric, citric acid, artificial and natural flavors and annato.  It certainly doesn't taste artificial, and I like that there aren't any preservatives in it other than the salt and vinegars.<br /><br />I'll definitely buy this mustard again from Amazon when this is gone.

review/summary: best mustard ever
review/text: I know, not a terribly original nor creative title BUT it happens IMO to be *true*.<br /><br />There's a creaminess to it texture-wise but has whole mustard seeds that give it this "pop". It has a depth of flavor that is bold and subtle at the same time. Does not "take over" my recipes, even lighter flavored ones like for macaroni salad but adds just the right amount of mustard flavor. Has a great balance between earthy and just a *bit* of sweetness, especially if/when the seeds pop as you chew them.<br /><br />I use this on burgers as well where it really gets noticed and again, hits all the right notes when combined with other flavors - try this on a handmade burger made with ground chuck, ground sirloin and ground lamb and you'll know what I mean. Actually, try it on a cheap hot dog and you'll STILL see what I mean.<br /><br />I buy this locally in these small jars as I cook for one and like it always to be fresh. Plus the little bottles look cute on the table if you have company. The larger squeeze bottles work well too and might be a better buy if you tend to use a lot of mustard.<br /><br />Ingredients: water, mustard seed, vinegars (white distilled, red wine, white wine), sugar, salt, white wine, garlic, spices, xanthan gum, tumeric, citric acic, artificial and natural flavors, annato.<br /><br />Very pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/summary: Wonderful mustard, and easier to travel with than Grey Poupon!
review/text: I really like this mustard, just as I like the Grey Poupon mustard that also has the seeds.  However, the Grey Poupon comes in a glass jar which (a) requires a condiment spoon or spreader to transfer the contents to your food, and (b) being glass, isn't very safe for travel such as picnics, etc.  In addition, the Inglehoffer container is slightly better shaped than the Grey Poupon jar, so that it takes slightly less room in a picnic bag or lunch bag.  Furthermore, I find even an opened container of Inglehoffer can be stored at room temperature for months without problems, even though I know the instructions don't say so.<br /><br />My husband finds this mustard a little too spicy, but for me it's delightful.  A much healthier sandwich spread than mayo, butter, or my wistful favorite, Brie cheese!!  Works VERY well with gourmet sliced roast beef.  And it's actually a high class condiment to accompany hot roast beef for upscale dinners!  VERY glad to have bought this on Subscribe-n-Save and to have multiple containers circulating in the kitchen, the TV room, the picnic cooler, at work, etc.

It has a nauseating garlic taste and absolutely no mustard flavor (the quintessential turmeric taste, which is the recognizable taste of mustard, does not even register, for example). Essentially, the manufacturers made sure this mustard LOOKED impressive by trumping up a stone-ground appearance. This is how they hook the customer into paying the inflated price. The value of the mustard ends with the appearance, though. We found it so disgusting that we threw it in the trash. Shameful.

In paste colors, you get a dramatic result with just a drop.  The Ateco are quite a bit better than the liquid color, and, for the price, it's probably about right.<br /><br />The bottom line - You get what you pay for.  If you want dramatic colors, you can achieve that using a good portion of the bottle.  If you want subtle colors, this may be what you're looking for.

review/summary: Great color
review/text: So far I've colored meringues, a cake, and buttercream icing.  The colors are solid - not at all wishy-washy.  You dont need to use too much though I wouldnt worry about applying with a toothpick as some writers suggest unless you are doing something very small or want a very specific shade.  I didnt try mixing them.  Very pleased with the results and the set of 6 gives a good range of color/shade options.

review/summary: Muted colors
review/text: I purchased these colors to replace the Wilton gel colors, many of which I find give my icing an off taste.  These do not affect the taste of my icing, so get stars for that.  But, while they are stronger in hue than the cheap, liquid colors, they are not nearly as intense as the gel colors.  I had to add quite a bit of red and blue to acheive purple, and even then, it wasn't a very vibrant shade.  I would recommend simply due to the taste issue, however.

review/summary: Great for kids crafts!
review/text: These dyes create awesome colors for kids crafts. I have used them to make finger paint, paint, play dough, and salt dough.<br /><br />Another reviewer stated that they are not natural - this is CORRECT. They are definitely artificial dyes. I tried making my own dyes, and when that fell through, these worked great in a pinch. You only need a couple drops for really vibrant color. And they are pretty easy to clean - don't stain after they've been made into whatever craft.<br /><br />Good product for the price!

review/text: I made brightly-colored cupcakes with these, using only a couple of drops - you don't need to use a lot to achieve a bright color. My only complaint is that they don't come with a guide laying out how many drops of what color combination are needed to achieve a specific new color. Other than that, they are definitely worth it and much better than the cheap ones you find at the grocery store.

review/summary: Very happy
review/text: My only complaint about this product is that sometimes it is difficult to squeeze just a very small amount from the bottle into the mixture to be colored.  I don't do massive amounts of baking, and I find that sometimes it is really hard to get a very light color when adding this product to very small quantities of mixture.  However, the colors are very bright and I was very pleased to find that the color is evenly distributed throughout the mixture.  I thought this product was a little pricy, but after trying it out, I do believe that it was worth the extra money.  The product seems of high quality and it shows in my cooking whenever I want to add some color to things.

review/summary: Wonderful product gives professional results
review/text: The spectra paste food colors are simply fantastic. They provide a depth and clarity of color that is impossible to achieve with liquid food colors. And the hues are beautiful and distinctive. The black and red, two colors which are very difficult to get when dying frostings, etc. are especially nice - probably the best of any manufacturer I have tried.<p>For those who had questions, I am not 100% certain about the sizes, but if the set is the same as mine, the bottles are 3/4 ounce. While that might not seem like much, all you need is a dot of this thick gel paste at the end of a toothpick to color large amounts of material. So there is plenty of coloring ability in each bottle - many, many times more than a same sized liquid food color bottle. <p>Highly recommended and at a really good price at the time of this review.

review/text: I'm really glad I bought the Ateco 12-Color Food Coloring Kit.  I found it searching for Black food coloring for my Halloween cookies.  I just finished my Christmas cookies which turned out amazingly thanks to this food coloring kit.<p>Each color is very bright and solid.  The pastes mix very well with frosting (I have not used them for anything else yet).  These are the nicest/brightest Christmas sugar cookies I have ever made.<p>You don't need to use a lot of coloring, just a drop or two, to get the perfect shade.  As such, each bottle will last a long time.

review/summary: This is the same product as Americolor,apparently
review/text: I just bought this set and I have not had the chance to try it, though I'm looking forward to it.  However, I just wanted to note that to my surprise, one of the dyes actually had the "AmeriColor" label on it, which I thought was a completely different brand of food coloring.  It was leaf green from AmeriColor rather than green from Ateco.  Furthermore, the bottles were all completely identical between the Americolor and other Ateco bottles in the bo.  I don't know if maybe they just remove the labels from AmeriColor bottles and add Ateco labels?  At any rate, you can save a few bucks by buying the cheaper AmeriColor since I think it's pretty clear that they are the same thing...

review/text: I don't know why anyone would ever use those little liquid food colors again after trying these pastes. The colors are more intense, and you can easily blend lovely shades for your icings. <p>Martha Stewart shows wonderful seasonal cookies from time to time on her TV show. A simple eggwhite-sugar icing on cookies in exciting colors makes such a wonderful table decoration as well as great dessert for parties, teas and other events. These paste colors are a must if you like to make frosted cookies or party cakes. <p>And these are especially fun if you have kids. A cookie-icing contest is a fun event for a birthday party, Christmas party or just a rainy afternoon.

review/text: I ordered this to try because of all the great reviews, but was not pleased with the outcome.  The color didn't seem to be any different than what I could get using Wilton icing coloring.  Also my icing started to separate in the bag while I was trying to decorate the cake which also made it darker than the icing I had already put on the cake.  I guess it was separating from the heat of my hands holding the bag.  I have never had this problem with the Wilton colors.  I guess I will continue to look for a coloring that can make my icing brighter and darker shades.

review/summary: great basic color kit
review/text: These Ateco colors are wonderful and blend into batters and icings seamlessly.  This is a good basic kit to start with. Ateco makes MANY other colors but this one will give you plenty of options and last a long time.  The colors are so concentrated that just one drop can give a whole bowl of icing a nice shade.  It's easy to get carried away with squeezing the drops out quickly but try and go one drop at a time and wait and check the resulting color after the icing blends.  For the darker colors, like red and black, you DO need to add a lot more than a couple of drops. When I want to make my royal icing bright red for Christmas cookie decorating, I sometimes use 10 or more drops for a medium bowl of icing.  I just keep adding till I like the color BUT keep in mind that the darker colors of red and black will darken MORE after they sit for awhile so make your icing a few hours before you need to use it (be sure to keep it covered to prevent drying out).

review/text: It was while at a friends home watching her use the grocery store food colour she had bought that I was reminded of why I love these Ateco full spectrum food colours. I am very very French in what I eat and how I bake and the products I need/want/use.<br /><br />Being a gel, you need less and the colours can be soft or bold.  If you are new to the gel I recommend using a toothpick to get a wee bit to mix in the dough, frosting, candy, cake, cookie you are making to better see if you actually need more.<br /><br />I love the violet for when I make my B&eacute;reng&egrave;re Abraham French macarons which calls for purple food colour to match the violet extract flavor.  Or green for when I make his Pistachio or  Kiwi macarons.  And the orange colour is magnificent and is used for one of my favorite orange liqueur frostings.<br /><br />Fact is these food colours are unlike any run of the mill food colour.<br /><br />They have the USA-K symbol on the box which I denotes kosher in the USA.

review/text: I've only used two colors so far - leaf green and royal blue.  I was super impressed with both colors though and the fact that it didn't take much gel to achieve a rich color.  This far surpased the Wilton gels I've been using in the past!<br /><br />I ended up running out of green frosting and had to color a second batch and it was amazingly simple to get a good color match between the two different batches.  I'm wondering if adding more gel would have made it a darker green or if I would have always ended up with close to the same shade of green...<br /><br />I think to really maximize the use of this product to get full color spectrums would be easy with a color mixing chart!

I feel like the color is not as intense, therefore I have to use more of it to get the desired color.  I'd been using the limited range of powdered colors that I have, and thought that switching over to the gel stuff would be okay but it has been troublesome for me.  Regardless, the colors (save yellow) are bright and vibrant.

review/summary: We love this set
review/text: I am glad that Amazon has a record of my orders, because we will order this again when we run out.  I use colorants for everything from frosting to soaps, and I haven spent a lot of money on colorants.  I even bought several of the Wilton gels and really, really hated them,  I found them messy to use and some of the gels tasted bad when you wanted a dark color, so I was looking for an alternative.  This gel seems to mix with everything and even dark colors taste good.  We made a rainbow cake and colored the cake batter and we did very dark colors. The day of the party, the cake tastes great - no detection of colorant bitterness, but 2-day old cake will seem to have a strange taste, maybe the color finally settling in.  The colors are great, and because they are dropper bottles, you can control the amount - they are very concentrated pigments, so one drop will do wonders.  If you want really dark colors, you will probably achieve it with just a few drops, but beware, it will, like other colorants, stain your countertop, fingers, tongue, skin, so plan on it and protect your counters, etc.  We are used to this, but obviously, wipe spills quickly.  Again, seems to be a no-taste colorant in a convenient dropper bottle with a lot of color choices, to save you mixing for the right shade.

review/text: I could spend a year explaining how delightful it is to have all these colors and they are a good quality and excellent value. My daughter who loves to bake turned me on to these.<br />You will have so much fun controlling and mixing and being a color scientist.  They blend well, mix well, have a  good consistency and came delivered well packaged and make Easter a whole new thing. Have to get some chickens to keep up with the color combo's/

review/summary: No better than Wilton
review/text: I bought this set mainly for the red.  I bake and decorate with frosting/icing quite a bit, so I was excited to get so many colors that were supposed to be of better quality than Wilton.  I used an entire bottle of red in 3 cups of buttercream frosting.  The darkest it would get was a watermelon color.  By the time I got to that point, my frosting had broken and looked terrible.  The royal blue wasn't much better.  The only reason I didn't give it one star is because I haven't used all of the colors yet, just red and blue.  I will stick with store bought red frosting and Wilton gel colors for everything else.

review/summary: Rainbow of Food
review/text: I'll admit it.  I am a food coloring novice.  For my entire life, I only thought food coloring came in 4 colors.  Bright red, bright yellow, bright blue and bright green.  If you wanted orange, you had to mix the red and yellow.  And if you accidentally added too much yellow, you had to add more red.  But then you could accidentally add too much red and have to add more yellow until you have a whole bowl of orange food coloring and all you wanted was to color a little bit of frosting so you could put it on a dozen cookies.<br /><br />Happily, I was wrong.  There aren't just 4 colors of food coloring.  There are at least 12.  And I bought them.  Not only did I buy them, I used them and loved them.  I little of this food coloring goes a long way.  Long gone are the days where you end up making gallons of coloring for a dozen cookies.  Gone are the days where you could never get the color just right without having to sand your table and rip out the grout of the tile on the floor because the coloring is everywhere after you tried to mix them.  These are amazing times where you open up the color you want and add just the right amount of exactly the color you were looking for.<br /><br />This is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to color their food.

review/summary: Great gel colors with excellent lids!
review/text: I originally bought these to use in pastry school, and have ended up using them on the job quite a bit.  The consistency of the gel is excellent, pretty much neutral, and so has little impact on the texture of the batter/gum paste/rolled fondant/etc.  The containers themselves are superior to the Wilton containers, as these have a hinged lid with a hole underneath, for easy squeezing.  The Wilton brand has solid caps, and so require the extra step of grabbing a toothpick or some other tool to dose it out with.  This may seem like a minor concern to some, but it's a definite selling point for me.

review/summary: Very Pleased- This will last me for years!
review/text: I am an average baker and used these for cupcake icing.  So far I am extremely pleased.  One single drop colored about a cup of white frosting a pleasing pink.  In an attempt to get black, I used 7 or 8 drops of black but ended up with dark grey.  A few more drops would have probably done it. Each bottle is 3/4 of an ounce but using them one drop at a time should make them last for years.  These do not compare to the store bought mccormick coloring- I will never buy them again!

review/text: Having never purchased any other colors than the liquid food colorings available at the grocery store, I was unsure of what to expect with these gel colors. All I can say is "Wow!" The colors are vibrant and blend in smoothly with whatever I'm making. None of them taste funny, which is good when you're really adding a lot to ramp up the color boldness. I was even pleased with the black color, which I have read can be purple or blue. This version looks very good when mixed into frostings and batters.

review/text: I just started cake decorating so these are my first "professional" colors and I was really happy with the results. I colored fondant and gumpaste and overall it was a good experience. I would have given 5 stars if the bottles were a little easier to get a drop out of, for instance if the bottle cap had a conical shape like Visine rather than a flat cap. That is very minor though and these are very nice colors for a reasonable price.

review/summary: Sordough's sour price tag
review/text: I have updated this mixed review due to the currently outrageous high shipping does NOT justify this product's value. Although This is the best gluten free sour dough bread I have sampled thus far it is much too expensive to pay upwards to $30 for 3 loaves.  I have shipped baked goods to military family priority mail for a flat rate of under ten bucks in the past.<br />Company states they will reduce shipping charges in the future but that doesn't help me or others currently eager for this product.<br /><br />As for the quality/consistency of this bread, It is fluffy compared to ther bakeries and has not molded after 10 days.  It toasts well and easily makes grilled sandwiches delicious.  The nutritional content is as follows :  1 slice is 140 calories, no saturated or trans fats, total fat 2 grams.  Cholesterol 20 mg, sodium 190 mg, total carb ( for one huge slice ) is 29 grams, fiber 1 gram , sugars 1 gram , protein 2 grams.  This has definetly a great sour dough flavor and is not gritty like other gluten free baked goods from other bakeries..I only wish the shipping costs were less with this and all other gluten free baked goods.

review/text: I'd rate the taste 5 stars.  I never thought I'd eat sourdough bread ever again.  I was excited to find this.  I ordered two loaves of bread and a few cookies from New Grains.  Everything is delicious - the cookies are remarkable! The consistency of the breads are a little....moist.  I like them best toasted.<br /><br />The company is in Provo, Utah.  This was my first order, and they threw in some extra cookies, which was nice.  And, delicious.  I wish there was something they could do about the shipping charges - I believe they are working on it.  I wonder if they could make a deal with Amazon Prime somehow.  Because there are no preservatives in the breads, as far as I can tell, they need to ship it quickly so I'm sure the options are limited.  I really like the products and would love to try some more, but I'm going to have to pace out my orders because of the $$.  Or possibly, Amazon Prime has spoiled me and I am a brat about shipping charges now.

I'm sure it will work for other meals, but I'm not the most creative or adventurous in the kitchen. Though it says "hot," I did not find it so.<br /><br />Because my husband and son "hate curry," I've been calling this "Jamaican pepper," just to get them to eat my baked potatoes. I don't know how long I'll be able to get away with it. Maybe by the time they catch me in my lies, they will be converts.<br /><br />Great buy for the price and spice.

review/summary: Good curry
review/text: This is a very good basic curry that is not spicy and has a wonderful taste. You can literally add it to almost everything to give it an "earthy" flavor.  It's great on noodles, on meats or even in scrambled eggs.

review/summary: Very good, but Sharwood's better
review/text: I like Rajah hot curry - it's very good, but nothing stands out about it.  Having tried Sharwood's hot curry, in comparison it's much better.  I guess the ingredients are the key:<br /><br />Sharwood's Hot Curry Ingredients:  Coriander, Turmeric, Fenugreek, Cumin, Salt, Mustard Powder, Rice Flour, Paprika, Fennel (3%), Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Cinnamon, Chilli, Clove, Ginger, Pepper, Bay Leaf, Cardamom, Nutmeg, Spice Extract<br /><br />Rajah Hot Curry Ingredients:  Coriander, Turmeric, Chilli, Garlic, Bengal Gram, Yellow Mustard, Fenugreek, Bay Leaves, Salt, Cumin, Fennel
