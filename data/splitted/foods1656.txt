review/summary: Smashed !!
review/text: I will never order this item from Amazon again!  The carton was delivered with no protective box or wrap around it.  The carton was mutilated and at least half of each bag of pretzels was smashed to crumbs.  Worst of all, this item can NOT be returned.<br />From now on, I'll buy my pretzels from Target.  They cost about 3 cents a bag more, you can buy fewer than 12 bags at a time and the pretzels come whole.

review/text: I would love to give this product 1,000 stars but I can't because I'm actually addicted to these! So yes, these are the best pretzels bar none (I guess I don't care for salty pretzels), but I can eat a whole bag in one sitting and doing so is about 900 calories. I cannot seem to stop at a single serving. Help!!!!

review/summary: Mini Pretzels
review/text: I had been looking for these unsalted pretzels for awhile.  I try to limit sodium, but love pretzels.  I used to live in PA (Snyder's headquarters) and could get them all the time.  Since moving to the midwest, I have not been able to find them.  I was very disappointed in them when they were shipped.  About 1/4 of the bag was pieces and crumbs.  Another reviewer mentioned this and I should have known, but I really had been craving pretzels and was hoping that Snyders had fixed their problem with shipping. Pretzels, great; shipping not so goood.

review/text: It had been more and more difficult to find decently priced Salt free pretzels in the stores.  The price offered by the case plus the free shipping made it possible to have a continual supply of unsalted pretzels in the house, without paying an arm and a leg.  The only problem was that, with the change of the expiration date on the credit card, Amazon's instructions resulted in my buying two cases instead of one.  But, the product is worth the price.

review/text: Not all pretzels are created equal.  These are fat free, and made from, if I'm not mistaken, a whole grain flour.  If I had a bag on hand, I'd look at the ingredients label and tell you exactly what kind of whole grain flour, but we're out at the present time (what a surprise).  My daughter loves to snack on these, and as a snack item, they beat a bunch of alternatives hands down.  The only thing..... they're addictive.  Get yourself a little bowl and don't go back for more!  Moderation in all things......

review/summary: Love this stuff, but MUCH cheaper elsewhere
review/text: BOTTOM LINE:<br />I love that this oil adds HEAT AND FLAVOR to what I am cooking, without the tangy-ness of hot sauce. It is an invaluable part of my kitchen.<br /><br />IN GENERAL:<br />The oil distributes evenly into most foods, especially liquid foods, and adds heat, flavor, and a little bit of fat to make the food delicious.  At the same time, it does not add the tangy flavor of hot sauce or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LO40AG">Sriracha</a>.  It is also more powerful and faster working than red pepper flakes or powder.<br /><br />FOR SOUPS and SAUCES:<br />I find that the Hot Chili Sesame Oil is the best thing you can add to a soup, sauce, or other liquid based food that you are cooking or eating.<br /><br />FOR SOLIDS:<br />Sometimes I will put this into the pan to oil it before cooking meats, and it works the same way as oil, while adding spice and flavor.  It is also a great addition to marinades, such as when I am preparing meat for stir-fry or high heat cooking.<br /><br />AS A SAUCE:<br />Finally, I can't review this item without mentioning that it is a great (although a bit fatty) sauce on its own.  It lacks saltiness, so you can add a little salt or soy sauce to it when using it, but it forms a great base for a Wonton, dumpling, or egg roll sauce - something you dip your food into for a little extra heat right before eating.

review/summary: Ferrero's missed opportunity
review/text: Nutella is stocked by the pallet in Europe, but much less popular in the USA for the excellent reason that the NJ plant produces an inferior product. This stuff is edible, but it's too sweet and doesn't have a strong hazelnut flavor. Ferrero finished Americanizing it by putting it in a much smaller plastic container and adding trans fat. Look for the genuine imported product or try making your own chocolate peanut butter. (I've tried making a chocolate hazelnut butter, but it's hard to duplicate the Nutella flavor)<br /><br />Update: Nutella now contains "modified palm oil" instead of the partially hydrogenated variety. It's nice of Ferrero to shell out the extra .03 per bottle not to use a substance known to be somewhat lethal, but I expect the flavor hasn't improved, or we'd all be hearing a lot more about it.

review/summary: Addictive, Yes.  And Tastes Like I Remember It
review/text: I was introduced to Nutella when I lived in France a few years ago.  Yep, got addicted; but had to cold-turkey when I left France.  Now I'm addicted again, thanks to that buttinski Amazon.<br /><br />Ah well, I can enjoy this stuff again, so thanks, Amazon.  It originated in Italy; and in France is eaten much like we do peanut butter here.  I think the French enjoy their sweets.  And hazelnuts are much more common there than here.<br /><br />Now, I see someone provides us with interesting comments on the New Jersey version.  That, I just can't counter.  My stint in France was '96-'99 and I'm getting old; so maybe my taste buds don't have accurate memories.  It tastes just fine to moi.  Good stuff!<br /><br />My only regret is the cost.  You know, if we on Amazon can make this more popular in the States, then maybe others (if they can find the hazelnuts in quantity) will produce imitations, Nutella will counter, and the marketplace will dictate a lower price.<br /><br />Sound good?  Try this item and get addicted, then.<br /><br />Still, considering the price of other chocolate products, is it that high?

review/summary: Not your European Nutella you fell in love in..
review/text: Growing up in Europe as a kid leaves a huge mark on your sweet tooth, being spoiled by the flavor and quality anything sweet left in your mouth. Nutella is one of those sweet memories that unfortunately did not carry over to North America.  Made in, out of all the places in Industrial area of New Jersey, is not a good starting point for launching one of Europeans favorite chocolate wonders! Some ingredients do not stick with original standards, adding processed ingredients, still using sugar, which is better than corn fructose. topping it off by putting the product in plastic jars! At this point I suggest a sugar cube, topping it off with Hershey's syrup, if this is what you like, then you will love New Jersey made Nutella, it will be like Christmas. If you want to try real Nutella, buy the European version in a real glass jar, with real ingredients, real milk. German, and Polish is the real deal.

review/summary: Nutella - very tasty alternative to Peanut Butter
review/text: My family and I have enjoyed Nutella the past few years. Amazon has a good price, about $2.81 a jar. It ranges here in Kansas around $3-4 a jar. It's basically ground up hazelnuts (also known as filberts), mixed with a chocolate frosting type deal... spreads on toast, very sweet. We also like natural peanut butter (meaning without hydrogenated oils etc. just peanut, salt) and we typically swirl on two thin layers. My son LOVES this in his school lunches or for breakfast ("brekky") on toast.<br /><br />Some lady asked about this at the grocery store, wondering what it tasted like, as she'd heard it was an alternative to peanut butter for those who were allergic to peanut butter. The jar I currently have does not give any of the warning disclaimers about "...produced in factory that has exposure to peanuts or whatever other allergic product... " thing (sorry I don't remember how they usually read but I am not seeing it here on this one, so presumably it's okay. For questions go to www.NutellaUSA.com or 1-800-NUTELLA ).<br /><br />Tt is sometimes hard to find at our various grocery stores - usually clear up at the top shelf almost out of my reach - especially at places like Wal-mart supercenters or the Target Superstores (I forget what they call them), and it tends to be more expensive at places like World Market.<br /><br />This one also says it was made in USA by Ferrero USA, Inc.<br /><br />Seems like 8 or 9 years ago when we first started seeing it on the shelves and buying it, it was actually imported from Italy. But apparently not now. But would be interesting to see the nutritional breakdown for the product still made in Italy. Typically I've noticed other products (like Malted Milk products etc.) produced for the Asian or European markets use less sugars than the one produced for us (unfortunately mostly overweight) Americans. So would be interesting to see what has happnened to Nutella.<br /><br />Otherwise... hey... it's pretty good!!

review/summary: Addictive and yummy nut spread!
review/text: Nutella is very tasty over toast, on apple slices, or even right out of the jar. It has the same consistency as peanut butter. Just make sure to exercise restraint because it contains a lot of calorie-dense ingredients. Each serving (2 tbsp) is 200 calories (100 from fat) and contains 21 g of sugar. In fact, the first ingredient is sugar, then palm oil and hazelnuts. The labels says there are over 50 hazelnuts in here. I find the sugar content overly sweet and it could be dialed down a bit, but that just means I have to use less of the spread.<br /><br />The jar is type-1 plastic (PETE) and commonly recyclable.

review/text: It is almost hard to believe just how danged delicious this Nutella is. It makes for an easy and awesome breakfast by spreading it on toast, or using it to make crepes. Those who love hazlenut will not be disappointed with this - this is a spread that you simply CAN NOT go wrong with - the flavor really is almost unbelievable! I would give this product a hundred stars if I could!<br /><br />It's cheaper to buy in grocery stores, though, and if possible, buy the original European version because the Nutella you find in many stores is Americanized with a change in recipe which makes for a inferior but still fairly tasty product.

review/summary: I like it, my daughter loves it
review/text: My daughter loved this when she was little. Since she was a very picky eater and it's a decent additional source of iron I let her have it fairly regularly. She started eating it when she was 7 after finding out Daniel Radcliffe ate toast with a chocolate spread for breakfast.<br />It is high fat, and I wouldn't risk it for people with peanut allergies because it can contain peanut oil. But for easy occasional treats it's very good.<br />The commercials say it's hazelnut with a hint of cocoa. I disagree, it's very chocolate-y. It's a great way to get kids to eat more fruit. Let them make roll ups with flour tortillas, fruit and Nutella and cut them into little pinwheels.<br />We also use it for baking. We cut out circles from pie crust and fit them into a mini muffin pan, bake them until they are golden, then spread in some Nutella with a silicone spatula and some jam on top of that, then add a pie crust flourish cut with a canape cutter and bake it again until the flourish is golden brown. Instant little tarts. It's also good with the miniature cheese cake you make with a cookie bottom in cupcake papers. Just spread the cookie with it, top with the cheesecake mix, bake as usual. Chill.<br />It's a little sweet for my tastes as just a toast spread.

review/summary: I can eat the entire jar in one sitting, easy.
review/text: Its so rich, nutty, creamy and sweet. The hazelnut flavor is by no means subtle, its very intense and absolutely divine. I mix this spread into ice cream, inside a crepe or just eat a spoonful when I am craving something heavenly delicious in my mouth. Its probably really bad for you because its super sweet and fatty but in moderation, I think it satisfies so well that you end up eating less - you know quality over quantity kind of a deal here. But if you are like me, and like a lot of a good thing then you and your waist line are in big trouble. ;)

review/summary: Caution: Highly Addictive
review/text: This stuff is amazing, but for me, that is a terrible, terrible thing. I can eat an entire jar of this stuff in a day (2000 calories by itself), plus other meals, fruit, etc. It tastes great on apples and bananas; I haven't tested anything else (I'd love to hear suggestions).<br /><br />That said, I would never recommend this product to anyone because I strongly feel it is very addictive, and I mean that seriously. It's worse than a bag of potato chips, and far unhealthier (imo).<br /><br />I will definitely *try* not to purchase anymore. I have half of 1 jar left.<br /><br />Oh, btw, Amazon's price is almost directly comparable to that of my local Walmart. If you're not a Prime member (and thus, have to pay shipping), I'd suggest going to the store if you want to save a few bucks. If you're a Prime member, they're practically the same, so whichever is more convenient for you really.

review/text: Words cannot express how much I love this spread. It is highly addicting so eating an entire jar in one sitting is easy. The taste is incredibly smooth and rich all at the same time. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the insanely high calorie count. It is 200 calories per 2 tablespoons. I am waiting for a light version to come out. This is probably one of the best tasting spreads in the world.

I was at work(I own and operate a moving company), it was hot and after we finished the job my client and I were talking about being hungry. She asked if I have ever had Nutella. I said no but I have seen it in the store. She insisted I try some spread on a piece of bread. Oh my gosh, this stuff is absolutely amazing. I immediately went to Kroger and bought a jar, it was gone by the end of the night. So, I searched on Amazon and found 5 jars for like 17 bucks, had to have it! It is good for breakfast, lunch or dinner. A great snack when one has the munchies. :-)

review/summary: Choosey mothers actually choose Nutella!
review/text: Fantastic spread for bread, toast, crackers, or as a topping on some other food items.  The unique smooth blend of the chocolate flavor with this hazel nut spread makes this product have a more interesting, sophisticated, and more satisfying taste than peanut butter, especially for the adult palate.  One devout wish: would love to see a "chunky-style" version of Nutella manufactured.<br /><br />Amazon's five-pak packaging of five 13.5 oz. jars offers additional savings [per ounce] over its individually priced 13.5 oz. jars [or even over its 26.5 oz. 2-pak], although when compared with individual jar pricing of this product at warehouse grocery departments and at super-sized grocery chains, the value of the Amazon pricing is diminished or even surpassed by these sores.  Yet, free delivery to one's door adds convenience and makes Amazon's 5-pak pricing slightly more attractive.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Unfortunately, we soon discovered that three of these 5 jars had freshness seals that were not fully affixed or had come loose when packaged or when in transit.  Amazon promptly replaced the entire order of 5 jars: this second shipment of 5 jars of Nutella actually arrived with the freshness seals of all five jars intact.

review/text: My kids and I love Nutella! Typically, we spread it on wheat bread with fluff (marshmallow spread) or with peanut butter. Those are easy sandwiches to make and a great choice when we're on the go since they don't melt and don't require refrigeration. The bottom line is if I can get my kids to eat more wheat bread, than this is worth its weight in gold. We do keep in mind that the first ingredient listed is Sugar.<br /><br />If you haven't had it before, although it's "hazelnut", Nutella really just tastes like semi-sweet milk chocolate. I personally don't know anyone who has tried this and didn't like it!

review/summary: Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on
review/text: This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own "stand" in order to fill it properly.

review/summary: This filter works PERFECT!
review/text: Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the "old fashion way" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!

review/summary: Ekobrew Washer Hack
review/text: When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16" thick, 5/32" inside diameter, and 3/8" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.

review/summary: Good Product and Excellent Customer Service
review/text: At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.

review/summary: great design
review/text: Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: This one is well thought out - perfect in every way!  I threw my old "My K-cup" out in the trash.  Did you know that some of the new Keurig brewers, such as the B-40, were redesigned a little?  Yes, and the new brewers don't allow the My K-Cups from Keurig to fit properly.  I called Keurig on this - and their customer service team says "some of the brewers were redesigned with slight changes that don't allow the My K-Cups to fit.  You have to move a small gasket down each time you switch between your K-Cups and your My K-Cup.  We don't have a new My K-Cup that works - so you need to just use this "work around" for the time being."  Now with my Eco-Brew - problems solved!  That's because it's the exact same size as the K-Cups!  No more changing the adapter in and out.  It works better too!  Coffee is stronger!  No more "hole down the middle" with weak coffee and wasted grounds that were never used.  Whoever designed this was a genius..... and too bad for Keurig they didn't think of it!

review/summary: AH-MAZING!!
review/text: WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!

review/summary: Techno-BEST
review/text: My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.

review/summary: Excellent brew, economical too!
review/text: With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!

It's very, very good.<br />Like some of the other reviewers, I have a hard time finding it at my local grocery stores.

review/summary: Not impressed by this tea
review/text: I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a> has a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.<br /><br />If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO64F6">SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY03TC">Bigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor.

review/text: After trying to find a green tea that I could actually drink and enjoy, I found white tea. It has all the health giving benefits of green tea -- maybe even more -- and it's so very enjoyable! Of all the white teas I have tried, this is my absolute favorite. The white tea is smooth: it has none of the bitterness or sharp taste of green tea, and the addition of raspberry is a brilliant touch. To enhance the raspberry flavor, try adding a little sweetener -- your choice. Drinking a cup of this tea is like giving yourself a present. Thanks Stash, you really do create world-class teas.<br /><br />P.S. Remember NOT to boil the water for this tea: it's far too delicate for boiling water. Instead, use water just under the boiling point and only brew for no more than 4 minutes -- it does make a difference.

review/text: I always drink decaf tea and that limits my options. That's why I was more than happy when I found this great tasting decaf vanilla tea. I don't even add sugar or milk to this tea, I drink it as it is and it's really delicious.

review/summary: Fantastic flavor!
review/text: I LOVE this tea.  It's delicious both hot and cold.  I go through a box in less than a week, so buying on Amazon, especially with Subscribe and Save is awesome!<br /><br />Thank you Stash, for yet another fabulous tea!

review/summary: Chocolate Fix
review/text: Although not as good as a piece of chocolate, it does the job at night when my sweet tooth acts up.  This is my nightime tea with the mere objective of satisfying a chocolate craving.  Great shelf life of over 1 year.

review/summary: a tasteful indulgence
review/text: I love this tea. I was grateful to have the decaf version for late at night. It is a fragrant delicious way to end the day. A much better way to purchase it rather than going through the stash website.

review/summary: Best Decaf English Breakfast Tea
review/text: This is the best decaf English Breakfast tea around. It tastes the same as regular English Breakfast tea.  Full body, not a weak decaf tea. Hard to find so I have been ordering it directly from Stash but it was great to find that Amazon is carrying it at a great price.

review/summary: This Flavor is Disgusting
review/text: I love some of their other teas, I'm a chocoholic, and I love hazelnut coffee.  But I HATED this flavor.  It reminds me of the pharmacy's first attempts years ago to flavor medicine--has a wonderful smell but a weird, almost disgusting aftertaste.  It actually made me a bit sick to my stomach!  I'll stick with the Vanilla Chai--very tasty.

review/summary: I HATE ALL TEAS EXCEPT THIS ONE!
review/text: I have never liked coffee or tea (or alcohol for that matter!) but I LOVE this Chai Spice tea. My little daughter does too, so I make sure hers is decaf. It's no longer available in my local stores, so I'm getting here at a great bulk price. I add the recommended sugar and milk and it is wonderful!

review/summary: Excellent "dessert" tea!
review/text: This tea is so tasty!  I use 2 bags and make a 10 oz hot tea.  After it steeps, I pour it over ice and enjoy my favorite drink of iced tea.  This chocolate hazelnut is great.  It takes care of that chocolate urge in the afternoon.  I love it!
