review/summary: Such a pleasant tasting surprise
review/text: I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease and started to follow a gluten-free diet.  Before I was diagnosed I took great joy in baking healthy whole-grain treats frugally from scratch and loved the nutty fullness that my breads and treats had.<br /><br />Once I cut out the gluten I continued to enjoy some of the other grains out there, like rice, quinoa, corn, and millet.  I have missed bread and pancakes, especially, however, as those were key parts to some of my favorite breakfasts.  At a recommendation I picked up a packet of this mix to try, skeptical of the gummy or crumbly nasty tasting pancakes I might have to be drenching with syrup just to swallow.<br /><br />As we mixed up the pancakes according to directions, I could tell that this was going to be something special.  It had little flecks from the almond meal that pleasantly reminded me of some of my successful whole grain pancakes (not tough dense things that some people consider food).  The texture was smooth and silky.  As they cooked, there was not the slimy looking top that the previously gummy pancakes had.  They were a little different from wheat pancakes, but still looked amazingly good.  There was very nice browning on the bottom after we flipped them over.  When they were done, they looked like pancakes.  REAL pancakes.<br /><br />Topped with a bit of maple syrup, these were such a treat for my poor abused tastebuds.  A fluffy texture, a fine grain, not a trace of gummyness to be found - I was in heaven.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, my search for a gluten-free baking mix stops here.  I have no desire at this point in my life (full-time student, wife and mom to a toddler) to relearn how to bake my favorite foods.  This mix is a great value, easy and so delicious - not to mention it is nutritious - that I am happy to save a place in my pantry for it.<br /><br />Thanks, Pamela's, for such a great product, and to Amazon for carrying it at such a great value.

review/summary: The BEST pancakes and easy too!
review/text: This mix makes the BEST pancakes, GF or not!  I don't buy any other kind any more because the whole family likes Pamela's so much.  I have to triple the recipe because everyone comes along and starts eating them as soon as I get them off the griddle.  When there are leftovers, they taste good re-heated but I will often eat a cold one while waiting for the ones in the microwave.  They taste so good, I usually don't even use butter on them, just some syrup and a little honey.<br />There are other recipes on the bag, but so far I have not tried any.  After reading some of the other reviews I think I just might try the scones or cookies recipes soon.  ;-)<br />The large 3-bag case is a more economical option than most, though the 6-bag case is priced fair too.<br />I definitly recommend this product for anyone following the gluten free diet or not!

With 2 Gluten Intolerant people in our family, and 4 non GI members who prefer this baking mix to wheat baking mixes, we go through a bag every few days. It is pretty much an equal substitution for flour measurements so no calculating necessary.  The nut adds great texture, moisture and flavor.

review/text: I hesitated for months before purchasing Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix; primarily because of the price tag that comes with it. We are not Celiacs, but have decided to follow a wheat free diet. However, this does not mean I never want to have a muffin or waffle again! I finally broke down and purchased this mix and I have to say that overall I am very impressed. While I have yet to use it in one of my own recipes as a substitution for A/P Flour, I can say that the recipes I have used from the back of the bag have resulted in some very delicious eats. My only complaint is that the liquid called for in the recipes located on the bag seem to be way off. Each time I have had to add more water just based on how the batter looks. Obviously muffin batter should not be as thick as cement! Even my kids who are not following a wheat free diet have commented on how tasty everything has been. They inhaled the blueberry muffins I made using this mix. Both the muffins and waffles I have made turned out light and fluffy, and not at all dense like a lot of G/F products. I personally have not noticed any odd flavors, or texture. Overall, very happy with Pamela's Baking Mix, and plan to buy it again. Hopefully it will result in some great G/F holiday baking as well!

review/summary: Gluten-free baked goods that actually taste great!
review/text: When I eliminated gluten from my diet a few years ago, I cleaned out my cupboards of anything that contained that menacing little protein.  I bought (and mixed) countless flours and grains trying to find a good substitute for all-purpose flour.  Every flour and blend that I tried produced baked goods that were either tough and rubbery or mealy and crumbly.  No amount of recipe-tweaking produced anything that I could happily feed to guests.  Enter Pamela's Ultimate Baking & Pancake Mix.  Now I can serve fluffy and delicious pancakes, bake awesome quick breads, and create yummy coatings for pan-frying.  It's been a while since I ordered so the packaging may have changed since then, but my bags are printed with nine different recipes, which gave me a good place to start.

review/text: Before I say anything, I should let you know that this is the very first pre-mixed gluten free flour I've tried. With that said, this mix makes absolutely delicious pancakes that are best enjoyed with real, pure maple syrup. In fact, I quite prefer the pancakes from this mix to those containing gluten. My only complaint is that when I bake with them, the sweet flavor of the mix can be a bit overpowering. If you adjust the amount of sugar added, this becomes less of an issue. Overall, this is an excellent mix!

review/summary: Best gluten-free baking mix ever
review/text: Don't even bother with other gluten-free baking mixes - this one's the best!  Why I love it:<br /><br />1) Excellent taste.  I've experimented with other gluten-free mixes and there's usually something "off".  I even tried one that had a strange, subtle metallic flavor.  I've fooled gluten eaters with Pamela's - they couldn't differentiate from gluten pastries.<br /><br />2) Anyone who's ever had to bake for a gluten-free diet knows the annoyance of procuring and figuring out xanthan gum.  In Pamela's case, the xanthan gum's already included in the mix, so there's one less thing to worry about.  I tried baking cookies without Pamela's mix and forgot the xanthan gum.  Surprise, surprise, my cookies didn't rise.  So this is important.<br /><br />3) Versatility.  So far, I've made pancakes, scones, crepes, chocolate chip cookies, pizza crust and cakes with Pamela's.  The range of what you can make with this mix is amazing.  Any time I have to create a gluten-free version of an old favorite food, I can probably create something using Pamela's.<br /><br />4) For what it's worth, the recipe ideas on the back of the bag are very helpful - AND ACCURATE.  I've gotten so annoyed by inaccurate recipes on food packages.  By contrast, I've found the ingredient amounts on the bag of the mix bag to be good.<br /><br />As with most gluten-free prepared mixes, Pamela's is a little pricey.  Even with this discounted deal of 3 bags, you're still paying nearly $15 a bag.  But the bags themselves are pretty big - it takes me weeks to go through 1 bag, but I'm an amateur baker.  If you're a professional or you bake more often than the average person, your needs will of course be different.  Also, the sheer quality makes the price worth it.  I can't imagine baking with anything else now.

review/summary: tastes good and is healthy too
review/text: This snack defies the rule of "if it tastes good, it must be bad for you."  I am into the low-carb diets and was thrilled to see that this only had 3% carbs in a serving.  I am also diabetic so I need to watch my carbs.  This is a fantastic and tasty solution.  Snacking on these helps me easily make it between meals without being too hungry and gorging on things that I should not be consuming like office donuts.  It also has 10% iron and 34% fiber.  The taste is a little like peanuts but the texture is crunchier - more like half-popped popcorn kernels.

review/summary: Delicious and good for you too...
review/text: These green soy nuts are a delicious alternative to the smaller soy nuts that you usually find in grocery stores.  They are great by themselves and also make a great addition to a trail mix with other nuts and dried fruits.  Buying them by the dozen is great because the packages are small.  A good value too, as the only other place I've seen them charges over 1.50 per bag.

review/summary: Tastey, but gets old after a bit
review/text: These remind me a lot of peanuts, but without the rich buttery feel peanuts have. The are lightly salty and have a great, satisfying crunch. They do not taste anything like fresh edamame. If you don't have anything to mix up the taste in your mouth, these will become a kind of tasteless dry snack food pretty quickly. In small portions, however, these are great. Since I have so many bags of this thanks to Amazon bulk I am going to experiment with these. I think they will be fantastic in some trail mixes with raisins and a variety of nuts, as a nut replacement in homemade chex mix, and as a topping for yogurt.

review/summary: Yummy and Healthy Snack with just a hint of salt!
review/text: I used to be a huge potato chip eater. After losing a very significant amount of weight, I started looking around for a healthy alternative to my former favorite to help keep me on track when I went looking for a snack. I first saw the Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame at my local Hannaford grocery store. I fell in love at first crunch! I get them auto-shipped every month or so to ensure that I always have some on hand when I get the urge. They are quite possibly the perfect snack; crunchy and salty, but with low carbs and high protein. What could be better? Nothing.

review/summary: Not consistent quality - flavor and even bag color varies -
review/text: When the product is good it is great. But I warn you in advance that they do not check the quality on the beans very well. I have received edamame that tastes sweet in one box, bitter in another, and even the color of the bag ranges from yellow to orange. The inconsistency shows a lack of attention to detail and quality control which certainly makes me nervous about continuing to purchase from SeaPoint. This item can't be returned so be very weary... Although I love it when its good, I have to say I hate it because of the high price and low quality control. I would like a refund for the 24 bags of sweet and bitter beans that I can't eat.

review/text: I've been looking for a nice healthy snack to munch on at night that's better for me than some of the fruit snacks that I've been having previously. (Of course fresh fruit and veggies are best but you can't always keep those on hand, especially when you're at work.)<br /><br />These are awesome. They're really nice and crunchy, plus they're relatively low in sodium compared to some of the stuff out there. I like that these have a lot of nutrients and protein in them since occasionally I'll get so busy that I won't get a chance to eat. (Especially during the school semester!)<br /><br />The only thing I will say is that you will need to have some water with you when you eat these. Not soda, but water. Eating more than a handful will leave you incredibly thirsty!

review/summary: Not too salty to my relief, but addictive like peanuts
review/text: I decided to give these a try since there was some discussion that these were healthier/less fattening than peanuts, which I LOVE, but I have weight issues and have to be careful with peanuts.  I buy unsalted roasted peanuts from an online store in VA and their product is just awesome.  I'm not opposed to salt, but I don't much care for a lot of it.  You can tell these are salted, but mostly as an aftertaste - it's not an immediate SALT ASSAULT on your taste buds.  Very crunchy, which I like (not as crunchy as unpopped popcorn as others have said, though, but WAY more crunchy than the grocery store national brand jar peanuts - which I used to like, but can no longer tolerate due to the much higher quality of online specialty nut vendors).<br /><br />Not sure if I'll give up peanuts for good, but these are going to be a staple in my pantry now.

review/text: These roasted edamames serve as a great alternative to junk food when your on a trip - especially a car trip. At first they take some getting used to (especially when you're craving greasy, salty chips!). But give a try for one day - and your health halo will be shimmering. One big incentive is that as they contain protein, they will satisfy your hunger instead of fueling it like junk food does.

review/summary: Great Filling, Diabetic Friendly Snack - Highly Recommended!
review/text: These "Dry Roasted Edamame" (soybeans to you and me) are a great tasting snack that is very low in net carbs (only 2g per serving) and also is very filling. The flavor is exactly what I expected, not overpowering and slightly salty (made with sea salt). These remind me of my childhood since my father and sister would fry up soybeans in a skillet with a little oil, soy sauce, and salt to make us healthy snacks. These are actually better for you because they are "dry roasted", so no oil is used, but they taste almost as good as what we made in our kitchen.<br /><br />Being diabetic, the low net carbs makes this the perfect snack food for me. While I normally scoff when a package says something like "Servings Per Container: about 4" because I know that to me it will all likely be gone in one sitting, but that isn't the case with these since the high fiber and protein content is very filling! Each 1/4 cup serving has 130 Calories, 10g Carbs - 8g Dietary Fiber = 2g Net Carbs, and 14g Protein. The package is resealable with a ziplock top, so the unused portion will keep fresh.<br /><br />These are great snacks for around the house or on the go. I take them to movies since there is never any diabetic friendly snacks sold in theaters. They do tend to make you thirsty!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: It is quite easy to live on a vegan diet these days (not that this is a requirement to enjoy these of course), and my girlfriend and I find no lack of tasty things to eat for our meals. These fit the mold perfectly. Dry roasted soy beans with just a hint of salt. They are nutty, have a decent crunch, but not a tooth breaking one, and just taste like a good clean snack. No oily, potato chip kind of feeling when you are done eating them. Additionally, each package has four portions in them, which is the ideal size in my opinion. Especially for me, since i generally only eat one full meal a day, and basically have a small snack every few hours the rest of the day. I keep some in my desk at work and some at home. Anyways, a definite great snack.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: As a vegetarian, these things are a lifesaver to have around. Lots of protein and the taste is pretty good. Not the best dry roasted Edamame, but 12 packs for 17 bucks is a real good deal. I can keep a few bags at the office all the time and each bag lasts a while.

review/text: It's very handy to have 12 bags of edamame sitting around in case of the munchies.  Definitely more healthy than a bowl of icecream or a bag of potato chips.  And at less than $1.50 a bag, I can afford to share plenty with my friends.

review/summary: Perfect as a peanut substitute on sundaes
review/text: These are OK by themselves, although I would prefer either more salt or some added flavoring.  Where these really shine is as a substitute for peanuts on sundaes.  Because I have to limit my carbohydrates and have other dietary restrictions, my typical "supper" is a sundae composed of frozen yogurt, sugar-free strawberry topping, fat-free whip cream, and edamame (this product).  The combination is tasty, satisfying, and sustaining without a sugar-level spike.

On the other hand they are one of the healthiest snack foods I can find. (14g protein, only 2g net carbs). As a replacement for the occasional mindless snacking I do in the afternoons when I'm working they're fantastic.

review/summary: Fairly filling for a healthy little snack
review/text: these are tasty little bits and surprisingly feeling.  A serving is a 1/4 of a cup, that 1/4 of a cup is really filling.  These remind me more of dried peas than of edamame.  I had been reading an article that ladies in their 30s should consider upping the level of soy in their diets.  These are the perfect snack to carry along, I usually tote around a big purse, so the 4 ounce package fits nice in their.  By the way 4 ounces doesn't sound like much except that these are really light, so 4 ounces is a lot of snack.  They taste pretty good on salads and I added some to my snack mix of nuts and seeds.  Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this snack.

We keep a small bowl on the kitchen island all of the time and the accessibility combined with how full they make you feel has caused us to really slow down on other snacking.  I liked these right away, but noticed that some people take a little while to get used to the texture, but they end up being fans in the end!

I came on here to see if I could find it cheaper than what I pay for it at the stores. I am very disappointed in that it actually costs MORE than what I pay at my store. And that's with the discount.

Unfortunately, either I got a bad batch, or my taste has changed.  I can only eat one or two beans before they get a funky aftertaste.  They are nice and crunchy, and just salty enough, but for some reason, the taste is off-putting.  Don't think I will buy these again.

review/summary: not for me
review/text: Last of the mistake of ordering 12 pack of snacks I never tasted.  Prolly just dry edamame is not for me, esp after jaw surgery this is still a bit too hard for me to eat at this point.  So maybe is just hard for me to review this with it being a very hard crunch that I should still avoid.  But it isn't really something I'd be craving if I'm in snack mood. It didn't make sense to bother with this as I love the Japanese style cooked edamame and this is no subsitute for that, then they are soft and so much easier to eat and you sprinkle some salt on them and hmmmm.  So I suggest stay with the cooked ones as I think jaw surgery or not these beans just taste way better that way, yeah is more work, u just need time boil them yes, once you do that tho it is a snack you could then salt and take with or prolly keep in fridge a few days.
