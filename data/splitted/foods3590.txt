review/summary: The best cookies ever
review/text: If you have food allergies and have a difficult time finding sweets that actually taste really good, then this is the product you need to try.  Orgran company is over the top in their ingredients and flavors.  These cookies taste like those purchased at a high-end specialty store, like a homemade teacake cookie.  The chocolate ones are also very good.  You don't have to worry about anything when you snack on these.  I'm so glad I ran across these at a health food store, and now can purchase them at such a reduced cost here on Amazon.com.  Love these.

review/summary: WORST COOKIES EVER!!!!!!
review/text: Cookies are horrible!!!! Worst cookies I have had in my whole life, and I am not exaggerating. I opened one of the 8 boxes and tried to eat one. I could not finish it. It smells and tastes how you would think dry dog food would taste. Styrofoam would have been tastier. Some people may enjoy the taste, as indicated in feedback. Other than the dog food taste, they are extremely dry and bland. They were not for me or my family. Requested refund from Amazon.

review/summary: Great cookies
review/text: It is tough to find allergen-free snacks that taste and have the texture of regular foods.  These Outback Animals are  just  like regular animal crackers.<br />My child loves them.  I give them to other kids who don't have food allergies and they like them too.  The individual snack packs make them convenient for lunch boxes.  We get both the vanilla and chocolate flavors.

review/text: My daughter loves the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK4F5A">Kinnikinnick Gluten Free Animal Crackers</a> so I thought she'd love these chocolate ones (she's a chocoholic).  But she hated them.  And when I tasted them, I could see why.  Compared to the Kinnikinnick, they were much grainier and a less favorable overall texture.  I can't recommend them.

review/summary: Great for little ones
review/text: This is a great snack/animal cracker for young children who have many allergies.  My son loves to chew on crackers of any kind, but it is very hard to find ones that are free from all the food allergies he has.  These are perfect for when I need a snack for him when we are wandering around town.  Taste wise, they are ok, but since my son is only 18 months old and eats anything he is given, he's not too picky when it comes to flavor.  For a wheat free, nut free, egg free, dairy free, soy free cookie, they are not too bad.

review/summary: Great Cookie Option for our Toddler!
review/text: Since our little one was diagnosed with multiple food allergies our options have been limited.  We make everything from scratch, of course, but sometimes, it is nice to be able to toss something in the diaper bag that requires no work and is a little sturdier than home-baked goodies.  These are it!  We can't really distinquish the animals too well, but that aside, for allergy-free treats, these cookies taste great!  Any child who doesn't take to them right away should just be offered them again & again...eventually they will appreciate them with gusto!  Our daughter did.  It is hard to adjust to allergy-free eating in general, especially if your kids have had the pleasure of tasting "normal" food.  Now she LOVES these cookies, though, and for me it is a convenient & simple treat to give her.

review/text: These are great.  Safe for my kids to have.  Small packages prevents too many cookies at a time complaints.  Plus, easy to pack in lunches, to share with class and for in the car.  We recently removed soy from our diet and found many of the peanut free products we had were off limits now.  OrgraN to the rescue!  Very happy.  I will be buying the large cookies for my sons preschool class birthday party celebration.  Great deal here since my local markets do not carry OrgraN.<br /><br />Plus, I emailed OrgraN to confirm the nut free labeling included peanuts and it does.  They sent me an email listing all products and production facilities use of peanuts.  Very helpful.

review/summary: Low marks on taste
review/text: My daughter has a severe gluten allergy, so I was excited to find these cookies. However, after trying one she wouldn't touch them again. I tried one myself and was underwhelmed. The texture is crumbly and rather bland. We have tried a range of gluten free products and I find these cookies to be disappointing. I normally try a product before buying a whole case, but I was unable to find this particular brand in local stores, so I took a chance, I won't be doing that again.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: Now, I've had these cookies before and they are pretty good, but have a bit of a sandy after-taste. However, my son with multiple food allergies LOVES thems and would eat as many as I'd let him. The problem is I've bought the big box, but they tend to get stale from being open since I don't let him have cookies that often...this is the perfect solution. There are 8 mini packs in each bag keeping them fresh and easy to grab and go. Perfect for a fun or "special" snack and to have on hand in the classroom in case a friend brings an unexpected treat to which your child might be allergic. Finally a animal cracker for kids with allergies. Thanks Orgran :)

review/text: If you have a child with multiple food allergies you must by this treat!  They actually taste really good (Mom had to do a taste test)!  My son (who just turned 2) loves his new crackers.  It is hard to find a snack that fits into his definition of a "cracker" with all of his allergies.  Now when he asks for a cracker, I can fulfill his requests (makes a Mom's heart happy).  Now we are going to try the chocolate ones as an extra special treat.

review/text: These cookies are fantastic!!  They don't taste gluten free at all.  My boys and I love these cookies.  They also are not high in sugar and have some fiber in them.  They are also casein free, soy free, nut free, among other things "free".  And, they are made in a dedicated gluten free facility.  We used to eat the kinickinnick animal cookie.  Now, we've moved on to these.  Again, the best GF/CF/soy free cookie we've ever had.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />P.S. Some viewers said they were "sandy".  I didn't get that at all.

That said, this was a great purchase. It was an early Father's Day gift and my husband really enjoyed it. He liked both the coffee samples and the food items. The coffee cup we received was not the one in the photo, but it was a really nice cup and of good quality, so no complaints. The whole thing is packed in a box as oppose to being similar as the photo and shrink-wrapped.  All in all, it was money well spent.

Since there was no card he assumed that it came from one of our vendors to thank us for doing business with them and the basket was divided up amongst the office.<br /><br />We did not want anyone to feel bad, so we did not reveal that it was from us, but I am a little sad and disappointed that he does not know how much we appreciated him letting us go.

review/text: Amazon did a great job on getting this basket to me on time.<br /><br />However, the product itself is unimpressive. The box is flimsy cardboard (not the attractive wood that the photo suggests). I can't comment on the flavors of the included items but I can say that quantities leave MUCH to be desired. The (4) coffee "packages" resemble single serve packets that are available in cheap motels. I think this would be a DECENT product at the $20-$25 price point.<br /><br />I am not sure I would want to give this to someone I care about.<br />This is the second (and last) disappointment that I have experienced with this company.

review/text: I ordered this for my mother for a Mothers day gift. She just notified me that she just got it and LOVES it! She immediately made a cup of coffee and said it is wonderful and delicious with the cookies that came in there. She also is very excited that the items matched her kitchen decor ( which I already knew lol ). Thank you so very much for your excellent services and I will be ordering gifts from you in the future most definitely! The estimated delivery said it would be there on a specific day ( I forget at the moment) but it came earlier than expected which is wonderful!<br />To all of you who are thinking about buying this for you or as a gift I HIGHLY recommend this or another item this company has for sale!!

review/summary: Great Treats!
review/text: These treats are the best we have had for the dogs.  They are good for the dogs and not full fillers.  We have 3 small dogs and they absolutely LOVE these treats.  The 2.5 lb bag is great ~ we don't run out so soon.  They are made from real fish and are healthy!  Only draw back is that they really smell fishy lol.. but we keep them in a sealed small storage container and we only smell them we when give them out.  Also, They are not cheap.  The price is worth the nutrition value and the lack of fillers. I highly recommend these treats for your babies

review/summary: A softer Treat
review/text: This is an excellent treat for all dogs! It's probably a bit large for very small dogs, but it's not so small that you need to worry about large dogs possibly choking on it.<br /><br />It's also softer than the Regular and Gold Yummy Chummies treats. So if you have an older pet this might be a good choice for them.<br /><br />I don't think it has as much Salmon as the other treats. So if you're worried about the Omega 3 Content stick with the regular or Gold treats.

review/text: Grain free treats are limited, and I try many of the ones I find. My dogs love Yummy Chummies, but i don't, so the review was dinged one star. They stink like dead fish in the sun, and the smell stays on your fingers after you feed them. Because of the smell and the soft crumbly texture, I would never use them as a pocket training treat (like freeze dried liver).

I realize the 2nd stages are still a pretty thin consistency which is fine, but this particular flavor is REALLY runny.  I mean dripping off the spoon before it can reach her mouth runny. We also give her the Earth's Best My First Soups, and even they aren't this runny. I have to mix this with mashed potatoes or egg yolk, or even some baby oatmeal cereal to thicken it up.  The other 2nd stage foods they offer aren't as runny as this one.

review/summary: Some broken jars
review/text: When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.<br />  My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.<br />  I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.<br />  I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?<br />For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.

review/summary: OK for an alternative snack
review/text: Purchased this variety pack and although I was VERY impressed with Amazon Prime shipping (I literally received it in less than 24 hours!), the snack itself is average tasting.  Mostly like flavorless cardboard.  The best flavor is the jalapeno one, pretty spicy.  It satisfies the crunch and salt factor, but no way is this a replacement for real chips.  I recommend PopChips original flavor which reminds me of Munchos, or PopChips BBQ flavor; both are satisfying and taste very good.  I would NOT purchase these Gourmet Basics Smart Fries again.  I even joked with my co-workers when they asked me what I was eating.."They're Smart Fries, but they're not so smart since they don't taste that good!"  They tasted for themselves and they all pretty much agreed with me.

review/text: I'm really disappointed in these, unless for some reason I got a bad box of them!  I've been buying the plain Pop Chips for over a year now, very happy with them but was looking for something new.  Well, these are too salty for me,,,,,I can't eat them.  So I'm giving the entire box away tomorrow to get them out of here.  What a bummer!  That's the problem when you try something new with Amazon in the food category, you have to buy a boatload,,,and if it doesn't work out, you've wasted $20.00.  I don't  see what the point is in air popping something so it's low in fat but then making it way too salty,,,,sure defeats the purpose in my viewpoint.  Not good,,,,I'm really not pleased.

review/text: For the cost this is not a good snack but if you don't mind how expensive they are then these can't be beat for calorie counters. A single bag offers tremendous taste and fulfillment for such low levels of calories and fat. My wife loves Popchips and I don't count calories but we both love these fries (mostly). Brief flavour rundown:<br /><br />Jalapeno is very hot. Tastes good. If you like jalapeno, you'll love these.<br /><br />Honey Mustard is the best flavour. Rich, bold, strong taste, very flavourful and high quality.<br /><br />Sea Salt is good but bare and basic.<br /><br />Honey BBQ is great. Weak BBQ flavour compared to most potato chips but still quality.<br /><br />Vinegar is decent, pretty good vinegar taste, again weak compared to most potato chips.<br /><br />Vintage Cheddar is the poorest of the lot, with a dry and musty white cheddar taste, which though real, tastes fake.

review/text: These smart fries are a great alternative to the usual chips, pretzels, and tortilla chips. You get a heap of pieces for 110 cals (I think about 60), and it definitely does satisfy that salty snack craving I get from time to time. As for the flavors, we got the 6 variety mix. Some were definitely good (the BBQ and japapeno ones were best in my opinion) but others were a bit rough to get through (like the vinegar/salt). Regardless, I definitely plan to get some more in the future.

review/text: I like the other two flavors, especially the BBQ.  But the jalapeno is utterly gross.  Nasty, in fact.  There's just not much else to say.

review/summary: High on Volume, Low on Flavor
review/text: If you want to eat a lot for only a few calories these are great. However the sea salt flavor is very bland and has essentially no flavor. They also stick to your tongue in a weird way because they're so porous. I think maybe the cheddar flavor could be ok but the three in this variety pack didn't impress me. I much prefer PopChips (especially the Sour Cream & Onion flavor) and recommend going with their variety pack instead. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVFDOO">Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a>

review/summary: Light but Filling !!
review/text: Excellent snack food to hold one over until the next meal. Very light but filling... I was amazed at how much is in one bag. I have not tried all the flavors yet but the ones I did I enjoyed. BBQ, Sea salt, Honey Mustard and the Salt & Vinegar were very good. I would like to have had a bit more flavor on the Salt and Vinegar but it was still tasty.

review/summary: GREAT HEALTHY SNACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I just bought a box of these salt smart fries and gave them to my kids trying to get them on a healthier diet. they loved them!!!! They said that they gave it out to their friends and so it seems that they all loved it! I got phone calls from their mothers asking were I bought this great snack from. There was a perfect hint of salt and definently not to salty like other reviews. I just ordered the 6 flavor case as the reviews were amazing. Thank you for making such a great snack.

review/text: Last time I went to the store(Big Lots) I was just looking around for a moment and my mom spotted the Smart Fries, she knows that I am calorie conscious. She grabs the Smart Fries and tells me, "look these have 80% less fat". We bought the product of course, when we got home I was hungry and ate half the bag my mom ate the other half. They were delicious, crunchy, airy texture, also great flavor, low in fat and calories! I want to buy more.<br />My mom is not calorie conscious and loved the fries.

review/summary: Not bad, not great...
review/text: I personally did not like these, but I gave the rest of the box to my mother and she had me order two more cases.  These are probably a good item for dieting because you think you are getting a lot for the calorie amount, but the flavor to me (and my husband) was sort of gummy and styrofoamy.  I could not finish a whole bag.  That didnt mean I was full, that meant I had gotten tired of them and wanted something more satisfying.  It is like eating a pound of celery when you really wanted a grilled cheese.<br /><br />By the way, I love the Pop Chips.  Much more flavor.<br />And my review was up for no less than a minute when I got a "not helpful" so I am not sure how this is not helpful, but the company requested that I write a review. If they are not happy that I didnt like the product, that is too bad.

review/text: I was attracted by the packaging and the ingredient list. I mean 100% natural, potatoes, cracked pepper, sea salt... sounds like a winning combination!  Except that it isn't.  These things are worse than eating nothing, because they have calories but leave me unsatisfied, so I'll go eat something else 5 minutes later. A perfect example of why people think they don't like to eat healthy.  Yuck.

review/summary: Need Improvement
review/text: Love Pop Chips and thought I'd give these a try.  First of all, I should say that the flavors are really, really good.  However, something in the manufacturing process ensures that very little flavor actually "sticks" to the fries.  I wish they could somehow infuse the flavor INTO the fries themselves.  As they are, they are like eating little pieces of styrofoam with a tiny bit of flavored powder on them.  As soon as the enter your mouth, the flavor comes off and you're left to chew and swallow the tasteless piece of styrofoam.  They use plenty of seasoning...it's just that most of it ends up in the bottom of the bag.  Dry powder just doesn't stay on a dry fry very well.  These have the potential of being very good.  And it's a good sized snack for the calories.  I just wish the actual fries had some flavor, instead of just the powder that falls right off.

review/text: This was the first time I had any issues with an order from Amazon - and the vendor handled it quickly and generously!  My order came in from the shipping company in a rather squashed box and I thought it was okay at first, but once I got a better look, the bags inside the box all had been pushed on hard enough to have small holes, so I emailed the vendor through Amazon and they responded the same afternoon that they would ship out a new box with the product I had ordered!  I think these smart fries are the best snacks and my two year old loves them too, so we were very excited about the quick resolution!  Thank you!

review/summary: Salted Styrofoam - But Low-Cal!
review/text: Gourmet Basics indeed! I think the basics are to keep it simple and let the natural flavor of the food shine through. I am blown away that they have actually managed to make a "natural food" taste faker than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00346J90Y">Andy Capp Hot Fries, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>. Rice cakes have a luxurious mouth-feel compared to these. I couldn't get past the fake flavor and horrible texture.<br /><br />I just can't imagine what type of odd palate people must have to think that these abominations are tasty. Perhaps people who are on a restricted diet might find these a convenient snack food. Or parents tricking their kids into eating healthy. I can almost promise the parents that these snacks will go uneaten. I would have been more likely to eat the unsweetened Baker's Chocolate in the pantry before I'd eat these.<br /><br />Though this product might be suggested by Amazon if you purchase Popcorners or Popchips, do not buy it. These are nothing like Popcorners or Popchips, these "Smart Fries" are nothing but awful.

review/text: I really like potato snacks and have not tried many that I did not like. This one however, I felt I had to report my experience. These are the worst potato snacks I have ever tried. not only do they not taste like potatoes, but they are also very bland as well. Put it this way, I received a case of 12 3oz bags and I opened one bag and ate about half the bag. The rest I had to throw out and I won't even inflict coworkers with this product by leaving them in the break room for free. Instead, I plan on using the bags as shipping protection to fill empty space inside a few boxes I have outgoing. That's right folks, packing material. That's what these excess bags of smart fries are good for.

The Honey Mustard & Onion has a decent flavor but it fades almost as soon as you start crunching.  The Sea Salt had almost no flavor at all.  The texture is great, a bit like a skinnier, more crunchy (yet light) Cheese puff.  I love the texture, I love the idea but the flavor needs to be amped up CONSIDERABLY.  I wish I hadn't purchase so much since I don't want to eat them.

I tried 2 other flavors and they had little to no flavor.<br /><br />Popchips are amazing and so much flavor with each chip compared to these.
