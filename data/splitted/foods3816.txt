review/text: When I got these I looked on one of the bags and it was way past the expiration date. They still sort of taste ok but almost every time I order a food product from Amazon it's either past or close to the expiration date so from now on I will not order any food item from Amazon. OK Amazon take note that to keep customers you need to add expiration dates to all food products advertised and let the people decide if they want it or not.

review/summary: Not a great product, especially for the price
review/text: I just bought a can of this product from my local grocery store as I am very into chocolate, and love to try new cocoa powders.<br /><br />I have to say that I was very disappointed.  It doesn't have much of a chocolatey flavor.  After reading reviews on here, I am not surprised Hershey's bought and now owns the Dagoba corporation.  Hershey's cocoa powder is lifeless...some people would of course disagree, but they are also the people who haven't tried too many of the "higher-end" powders, like Perginotti, Droste, Valhrona, or Green and Black's Organic Cocoa powder (my favorite).<br /><br />Anyway, save your money for a better product.  I think I will donate my can to a less discerning and grateful friend.

review/summary: More information, please
review/text: It would be nice if Amazon would take responsibility for providing complete product information for the items they sell. For example, a buyer might assume that the name Dagoba was significant, perhaps representing the company that manufactures the products. In reality, since 2006, the company that produces "Dagoba" chocolate is Hershey's. The cacao products may still be organic and trade certified, but buyers of the products are supporting a huge multi-national corporation, not the small, ethical business that the name Dagoba originally represented.

review/summary: THIS IS NOT CHOCOLATE!!!!
review/text: The Dagoba Cacao powder is NOT chocolate coco powder.  In order to turn cacao seeds (the Dagoba powder) into chocolate you must use a long process of drying the beans, roasting the beans, squashing the beans to get the cocoa butter (by the way, the cocoa butter is the "chocolate" we know), use the butter to mix with sugar and other stuff, and finally, re-roast with the blended mixture of cocoa butter and sugar/etc.  The actual bean was tossed out of the process way back when we got the cocoa butter out of it.  This particular product, Dagoba Cacao powder, is the bean, not the cocoa butter.... hence, it is not chocolate.  Why would anyone in their right mind buy this non-chocolate rip off?  This is why:  the cacao bean is extremely healthy and possess many pharmacological benefits for the mind and other parts of the body.  This powder should be used in a smoothie much the same way ginseng, Vit C, ginkgo biloba, etc. is used.  I hoped this helps!!!

review/summary: Healhy bar
review/text: I am trying to follow an organic and gluten free diet. So it is hard to come across products that meet both criteria. I also like to buy from reputable companies. And these bars meet all the criteria I was looking for:<br />1. They are organic.<br />2. They are gluten free.<br />3. They are also soy and dairy free.<br />4. Also they do not have any peanuts or cashews for those staying away from these products.<br />5. They are vegan.<br />6. All natural (and organic) ingredients you can actually say their names: almonds, hemp nuts, apricots, apples, cranberries, rice crisps, rice syrup, lemon juice, vitamin E.<br />7. High in Omega-3 and Omega-6.<br />8. The company is a very reputable company. Who is not familiar with Bronner's soaps?!<br /><br />The reason I gave these bars 4 stars is that even though nutritionally they are wonderful the taste is not the best. They are hard!

review/summary: This time everything was *perfect*!
review/text: Well if you have read some of my other reviews, you know I have not always had good luck with my Amazon food / candy purchases. I decided to roll the dice & try again. I have *great* news to share!  This time was a winner for me.<br />First the price. My local stores wanted on average $2.61 per bag for the same size bag that Amazon was selling for (I think I am doing the math right in my head) for $0.94 a bag on average (Amazon was selling in a quantity of 6 bag bundles). So I was able to make some fatter Easter baskets for a smaller price.<br />Second the weather. I took a chance with two day shipping after I consulted with a weather site & discovered that there was going to be a drop in the temperature outside. This year it seems we are jumping right over spring & headed for an early summer. When I noticed it would be upper 50's for daytime high & upper 30's at night, well that was another deciding factor. Two day prime shipping would be just fine & no extra money needed for overnight & no worries about the chocolate getting too hot. As far as I know Amazon does not have any kind of cold shipping for perishables (or maybe I just have not seen cold shipping because I have not bought anything Amazon uses that kind of shipping on). It seems I was luckier than some folks that had the unfortunate experience of receiving melted chocolate candy.<br />Third great thing  Items were well packed with air bubbles to keep them from breaking.<br />Finally the last thing. TASTE & FRESHNESS<br />Yay!  They were really great this time with nine months in the future before expiration!<br />Tasty.<br />I really wanted to post a positive review because I took the time to write & complain on a couple of previous reviews about dissatisfaction with my food purchases.<br />It seems these days that when we are unhappy we take the time to write negative reviews & complain about our dissatisfaction.  However, we often times forget to give a business or individual a compliment when we receive good service.  Thanks Amazon for making my Easter basket $$$ go further this year with the great prices & for getting my items so quickly to me!!

review/summary: My Little Boy Loves Goldfish Colors.
review/text: My little boy (3 1/2 yrs. old) just loves Goldfish. I'm not sure where he got it, perhaps the grandparents. In any case, I have trouble with him in a little store I go to because they have a display of Goldfish cartons and we can't get by it without getting one. Any of you with kids probably understand. Well, now he loves Goldfish Colors and that probably also goes back to Grandpa. In any case, now Goldfish aren't good enough and Goldfish Colors are the only thing that will do. Fortunately, the store has some 6.6-ounce bags of them, so every time we're there we have to pick one up. Oh well, I enjoy Goldfish too so there's never any problem in getting rid of them. Personally, I grew up on Cheezits, but I like Goldfish just as well. Now I notice the Goldfish bag has a little notice in the upper left-hand corner that specifies the colors are from natural ingredients. That's good as I don't trust all dyes.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Once again Pepperidge Farms has created a wholesome snack that is not only good for you but also good for children too; and a whole lotta fun to eat! Forget junk food when there's better food that's not only fun but wholesome and satisfying  but be careful; there are other "fisherpeople" out there who will raid your snack!<br /><br />Here's a bonus for those who were unaware - they are not "salty" like others are, plus for more specific info; you can always visit the Pepperidge Farms for they have various other products that are diabetic to heart healthy. Additional bonus is people who wear dentures won't die of embarrassment and enjoy the pleasure of munching on these beloved crackers. And those who have dental medical conditions by reason of medications or some type of genetic or health issues will also find these easy to eat as well - making them easier for Parents to Caretakers to monitor their loved ones or the ones they are overseeing.<br /><br />I also use these as Salad Toppers instead of hard croutons for a "Spring / Summer" fun - it adds spark and interest as well as contrast to your salad; even when entertaining ... who would have ever thought of tossing these precious yummies into salads? And plus, if you can't get your child to eat salad, they will when they see Pepperidge Goldfish in there swimming in cheese, lettuc, tomatoes - or even a Taco Salad to make Food interesting and introduction to healthy-eating to a child.<br /><br />If you have a picky eater (child) that just won't eat his/her veggies or just only specific types; try tossing a few Goldfish and sprinkle with cheese after cooking or steaming veggies and then at last minute toss in the fresh grated favorite cheese and some goldfish and toss; serve dinner immediately and observe after remarking that we're eating goldfish tonight that is swimming in our food.  (Leave it at that...) That is how I got my step-grandson to begin to eat other vegetables besides green beans, potatoes and corn. He was having too much fun playing and eating the veggies and "swimming" while eating at the same time that he forgot the rest of his dinner! *laughing*<br /><br />Thought I would toss an old trick I had done to my son when he was young, it still works... those Pepperidge Farm Goldfish are magical!

When the six more arrived they were completely thawed and now I am afraid to eat them  -- maybe I will fry them up and give them to my dog -- he has a strong stomach.  The six that arrived on time and still frozen were delicious.

They arrived still frozen and the two I have eaten were delicious.<br /><br />So all told, I originally ordered 12 -- only six arrived -- six more were sent but were thawed -- but then they sent 12 and they were great.  So in the end I ordered 12, but got 18 great steaks.  Omaha made it more than right.  Omaha may not be good at counting but they get an A for effort.

review/text: These western assortments of pressed sugar were an awesome addition to my son's Bday cake and to the chocolate dipped oreo cookies I made. Everybody was impressed by how cute they look. The cookies were a conversation element at the bday.<br />Those little pressed sugar items were packaged with care and received with no damaged. I strongly recommend them!

review/text: My puppy (Shia) and 5yr old (Miss Peaches)loves this food. Once I purchased my new lovely new baby I wanted a puppy food that would be good for her. This brand has no by products in it, but has all the natural ingredients for the well being of your pets, it's the real deal for a healthy growning puppy and the adult dog food my Chihuahua, and Pom loves. I'm sold and I won't change a thing.

review/summary: Great !
review/text: Started feeding my two older dogs (12 and 13) this food. My lab has always had dry itchy skin. After a week on Avoderm he is shiny and not flaky at all! My german shepherd is usually picky over food but he loves Avoderm. I highly recommend this food. Packaging and expiration date were fine and I will definitely order from amazon instead of buying in a pet store. The price is way cheaper! Higher quality food really does make a difference in the health of your pets...I wish I had started feeding them Avoderm sooner.

review/text: With Amazon Prime free shipping this food is a great deal. Much cheaper than in the pet store.<br /><br />My two dogs, both seniors, love this food. My small dog has a skin problem during the warmer months and this food has helped him to not be so itchy. My large dog has arthritis, for which he is taking a glucosamine chondritin MSM supplement and aspirin. When my large dog began eating this food, after a few weeks I saw an improvement in his movement. Not so stiff now and it's easier for him to jump.<br /><br />Recommended for people who have senior dogs with skin or arthritis problems.

review/summary: Gassy and loose stool after 1-2 weeks?
review/text: My 4 month old American Eskimo started eating this brand about two weeks ago and in the last several days I've noticed her stool very loose and smelly. Not only that, she farts! She does like the food. I give her 1/4 cup in a cloth pouch she likes to eat out of instead of a bowl. On occasion, I've mixed some of the Avoderm canned food with her dry kibble. I'm a little disappointed with the gas and loose stool. Before Avoderm, she didn't care for Iams Puppy, Wellness SuperMix Puppy, or Halo Spot Puppy... she would eventually eat those when she was starving but the Avoderm she likes! When she finishes this 4.4 lb bag, I'm going to start her on a different brand that might be better for her to digest. Or maybe her stomach will adjust??

review/summary: Mott's NATURAL? Even better!
review/text: Even though this listing is for "Mott's Natural Apple Juice" - the product shot is not of the "Natural" bottle, but rather of the regular 100% Original.  I'm not complaining at all since I wouldn't normally have tried the natural style but it turns out I really like it a lot.  So what is different if anything about this kind?  The label informs me that this is a blend of "fresh pressed apples" and apple juice concentrate.  This gives the juice a slightly darker appearance than shown here.<br /><br />I tend to rotate between apple and grape juice, while mixing in other varieties here and there but I really drink a lot of apple juice and am fairly picky about what I will drink.  If a juice has clumps or sediment or is in any way fermented or cider-y or overly sweet then I pass. (EXTRA pulp? In MY OJ?! Oh heavens, no!) I prefer apple juice I can chug like sweet tea after mowing on an August afternoon and this does the trick.  Speaking of tea I did make an "Apple Palmer" with this and it worked just fine.

I guess this is why it's cheap while claiming to be organic - yes it "contains" organic soy, but not as much as the other brands of soy milk at all. Obviously they put too much sugar cane juice in it to keep the price low. I am very disappointed.<br /><br />Yes it is sweet and smooth, but it tastes a lot more like plain sugar cane juice than soy milk.

review/text: I liked these peas more than the ones i bought at Wal-Mart.  But they had much more of a kick to them, too.  If you've never tried wasabi peas, you might want to check with your local retailer first to try a tamer version.  But don't eat too many at once, or your head will fry.  If you don't know what that meant, then you've never had wasabi.

review/summary: Nice but Yellow #5, Blue #1 dye and palm oil
review/text: These are indeed nice Wasabi peas, but they for some absurd reason feel the need to add Yellow 5 and Blue 1 dyes to them. The peas are mostly coated with varying amounts of sugar/starch mixture which covers them anyway and it is annoying that they feel they have to use dyes. If you look at the amount of fat in the peas and the nutrition profile, you can see that the frying in palm oil adds a lot of oil to them and fat (including about 1g of saturated fat per 1 oz serving). While they taste nice because of the Wasabi, they have taken a healthy pea and turned it into an unhealthy pea - so don't get these for a healthy snack compared to some real fresh peas!

I am allergic to lactose, gluten, soy, mint and grapes, which has made it hard to go through these past several years craving soda crackers or something akin to them, and even trying (unsuccessfully) to come up with a workable recipe I can make for myself.  Now I have found them!  These are my newest comfort food.  Wonderful with a chilled glass of Diamond Almond Milk, and I am that little kid back in the kitchen sitting with my milk and crackers.  The texture and tender-crisp "bite-factor" (to me) is so close to that of good, old fashioned crackers - - and the flavor is just deeply satisfying.  I will be up in the middle of the night snacking on these for sure.  I cannot rave enough about them, but I see that others agree with me in the quality and "yummy-ness" quotient of these wonderful chips!  To me they taste closer to crackers than tortilla chips and that is SOOOO yummy!<br />Thank you AMZ for putting these on S&S!!!  Come next payday I will need to be getting a whole case, maybe 2!!

review/summary: Good but Variable
review/text: I bought these at a grocery store and I had all I could do to not eat the whole bag and then lick the wrapper.  So olive-y! So delicious!!!.  Amazon had all BUT Olive so I waited for notification which came pretty quickly.  I ordered a case and I was....disappointed.  While the lot I received is good, it is not shout-from-the-rooftops good like the first bag.  My case was quite garlicky and slightly burnt flavored, but not really olive-y.  That first bag was so good though, that I will try again.  But not maybe by the case.

review/summary: Tasty, but not the best chip ever
review/text: The Olive tortilla chips are tasty, but I certainly would not rate them the best tortilla chip ever.  The olive pieces in the chips are very small and dried.  They impart a light earthy flavor in the background and in no way overwhelm.  These are excellent with dip and do not break easily like some other gourmet chips.

review/summary: Olive Chips
review/text: These chips were amazingly delicious!<br />These olive chips were thin, crispy, tatsty, yet not too salty.<br />My 2 year old son loved them. The best part of these chips is the fact that they (chips) are super healthy.<br />These chips are also small enough for your little ones to enjoy and eat easily.<br />I highly recommend these chips for any occasion, especially to place in your or your little ones' lunch box.

review/text: I like these tortilla chips.  You can taste the olive but only faintly-you know it is there so you search out the taste but it is is a background flavor.  However if you don't like olives don't order these!  The fat content is reasonable for a snack food and they are satifyingly crispy!

Over all I have had lots of different brands, flavorings and such of tortilla crackers/chips but I think these were unique first the multigrain thats something new in a tortilla to me and I thought that was tasty ,then they added the olive flavoring . I loved it instant hit with me I would definitly buy these anytime i seen them in a local grocery or back on amazon someday . I think they are unique  and something as I said a different pace and taste definitly worth getting others interested in trying.

review/summary: Good. Different. Not too strong. Could maybe be stronger.
review/text: I'm a pros and cons gal. I tasted these chips expecting a basic tortilla chip with a hint of flavor, which is what I am used to tasting. The flavor was stronger than subtle and the chips were utlra-fresh tasting. Straight up, here's the pros and cons:<br />PROS: Super fresh. Nice portion size, especially because you'll want more than one portion. Attractive on a plate, unlike traditional tortilla chips. Good amount of flavoring. Light, not greasy. Chips were sturdy and didn't crumble in the bag easily. No pile of "chip-lets" at the bottom. Would probably be a nice surprise in someone's lunch box or at a movie party or summer get-together.<br /><br />CONS: Probably not great for dipping. If you're an olive lover, you may prefer the flavor to be more potent, as I did. If you're concerned about packaging waste, there's a lot of extra bag here which seems wasteful.<br /><br />I personally felt the olive flavor could have been stronger, so I withheld one star, but that is my personal taste. Several people felt it was strong enough. They are definitely worth trying.

review/summary: Average Chip...
review/text: Firstly, these chips look better than how they are depicted on on the bag. With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor. There are specks of olive in the chip, but being it's a corn chip to start with, it's hard to recognize them. The taste is distinctly "olive" and the salt content is just about right for my taste. I tend to like my chips a bit on the salty side. They have a good amount of "crunch".<br /><br />I can't say whether I'd purchase them again. I suppose if the price was right I would. However, I have issues paying a premium for junk food. You can dress it up in a nice bag, put a great name on it, but it's still junk food- it's a corn chip. I'm much more likely to purchase the better known simple brands carried by my local grocery store.

review/summary: Tasty & healthier substitute for junk-food chips
review/text: Are you the type of person that always needs a side bag of chips to accompany their lunchtime sandwich but then feels pangs of guilt afterward for consuming  that extra 120-200 trans-fat laden empty calories?  If so, FoodShouldTasteGood's line of nutritious tortilla chips strikes an effective balance between satisfying your junk food cravings while providing some nutritional benefit by way of high quality ingredients and a few grams of fiber to boot.<br /><br />The most important factor though is that with their 'Olive' line of tortilla chips (think of a white corn tortilla chip with flavor profiles of black and green olives and a hit of garlic) the taste itself is good enough to convince the staunchest junk-food addicts to reach into that bag for yet another bite.  These chips go well with everything from sandwiches to soups as well as served plain by itself.  These chips are tasty enough with the right crisp texture you've come to know and expect from your standard snack tortilla morsel.  Great product all around.

review/text: Olives and tortilla chips...who ever though such a combo would be so good? No trans fats, not overly salty, nothing artifical (like the label says...) makes for something a bit different that your typical tortilla chip.<br /><br />You don't need any salsa or cheese on top of them -- the flavor is perfect (if you like the taste of green olives, that is.) You'll be asking for more as the 1 oz. bag will not be enough!

review/text: When looking for snack products, I tend to look for those with the fewest artificial ingredients or no artificial ingredients, if possible.  On this count, chips from Food Should Taste Good easily qualify.  All the ingredients are pronounceable and identifiable (quinoa, pronounced keen-wa, is a South American grain).  I have now tried three of the seven flavors, Chocolate, Sweet Potato, and Multigrain, and they all, well, taste good as the brand name implies they should.  The Multigrain chips have a wholesome nuttiness that would go well with a variety of dips (although I'm eating them plain).<br /><br />Best of all, they're kosher, gluten-free, and vegan.  How can one go wrong?

review/summary: Very good tortilla chips
review/text: The taste of these is right between Tostitos Multigrain chips and Original Sun Chips, and that's pretty nice place to be. A little sweeter corn flavor then the Tostitos, but not as much as the Sun Chips.<br /><br />They company/brand/motto of FoodShouldTasteGood lives up to its promise. Even though tastes vary greatly I think most people who like tortilla chips or even thin crackers like Wheat Thins will find these very enjoyable.<br /><br />One thing I thought was funny was that the mini bag seems to be just a scaled down version of the large bag since the picture which they claim is "Enlarged to show texture and detail" is really a bit smaller than actual size (which is about a 2" x 1.5" hexagon).

review/text: These were absolutely delicious.  They came very nicely packaged, with a thick and smooth exterior plastic packaging.  I was a little disappointed that the package was mainly air- there were only about 15 chips in the 1 oz. bag.  However, each chip was delicious and wholesome.<br /><br />They were perfectly seasoned- not too salty, but just enough to bring out the flavor.  The sesame and flax seeds were very evident, and a nice addition.  The ingredients list the chips as being partially made from corn, but frankly, they tasted mainly like whole wheat.<br /><br />I ate them plain, and they were excellent.  I think eating them with salsa would be a waste!

review/summary: Tasty chips
review/text: I love tortilla chips, just good ol' fashioned corn chips with salt on them.  I was curious as to how these fancy tortilla chips would fare.<br /><br />Before even tasting these chips, the bag shows that the company is serious about freshness.  It's tough and a little slippery; I almost couldn't open it by hand.  The chips are little hexagons about 1" in diameter, with the various seeds clearly visible in the chips.  While the corn flavor is dominant, the various other elements of these chips really blend well to give them a unique flavor.  They're not overly salty - indeed, if I had any quibble, it's that a little more salt would be appreciated.<br /><br />These chips would be an excellent choice for finger foods for a higher end dinner party, a date, or just an evening when you want to treat yourself.

review/summary: Pretty tasty chips with no weird ingredients
review/text: These multigrain chips are more like those vegetable/organic/seed crackers than a tortilla chip.  It does taste a bit like a tortilla chip, but most of the flavor comes from the seeds in it.  I don't think they're too salty and the flavor is pretty well balanced.  The thickness and crunchiness is comparable to that of a Wheat Thin.  I only had one chip broken in half in the last bag that I ate.<br /><br />The ingredients list is pretty interesting in that there aren't any long chemical names: stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flour, flax seeds, turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt.  Take a look at the gallery above for a picture of the back of the bag.<br /><br />Each bag is 140 calories and contains 7 grams of fat so they make a pretty good snack.

review/text: This product is a perfect size for a lunch-box or a quick snack.  I find it to be hearty and quite filling.  The whole grains are entirely satisfying and work well with most traditional accompaniments for chips.  They are a nice break from the same-old corn chips and all of my guests who have tasted this product find them to be tasty and interesting.  Many have gone on to buy and enjoy this product themselves.  Just like the olive-flavored chips, virtually all the chips are whole and unbroken, which is a nice change of pace from what one gets with most similar products.

review/text: These chips are a nice break from the carbon copy corn-chips that we are all used to.  They have a nice, but not overwhelming, flavor of olive that is really quite delightful and that even people who dislike olives might enjoy.  They go well with guacamole, salsa, one of my favorite spinach dips, vegetable pate and just about any other dip that one might care to eat with it.  They have a hearty taste and texture that is quite satisfying and almost all the chips are whole.  The size is right for a lunch.  Frankly, I cannot imagine anybody not finding these chips enjoyable.<br /><br />I suppose that the only caveat is that if you specifically want the same-old corn chip, then this is probably not for you.

review/text: I'm always in search for good, healthy, whole grain products.

They are not overly salty like most other tortilla chips, which is a nice surprise.<br /><br />They are hearty chips and hold salsa well without breaking. They have a very good taste - corn, nutty, slight hint of salt, and hearty.<br /><br />My main complaint is with the texture. They're crunchy, but have too much of a cardboard texture for my liking.<br /><br />Overall, they're deliciously healthy chips, if you can get past the texture.

We strongly sense the company really believes that, "Food Should Taste Good."<br /><br />Although we were skeptical at first, the unique olive flavor attracted us to this product. In addition, there are NO artificial colors, flavors, or GMOs in the ingredients.<br /><br />After opening the bag, we observed an attractive sight and scent and . This product is not like average chips, it has the aroma of real-food. The taste is also unlike any other, not only because of the olive flavor, but because of the marriage between the cracker and tortilla chip. The crispness is just right, and the Olive flavor is included without dominating other ingredients. The one-ounce serving size is just right and allows one to easily travel or pack this with a lunch.<br /><br />Overall, this healthy snack is recommended for both kids and adults.

review/summary: Good snack
review/text: I've tried 2 types of FoodShouldTasteGood chips - the Multigrain and these. I must say, I'm impressed with both. Most snack foods go out of their way to hit you over the head with their flavors. Not so here. The tastes are subtle and interesting. Gourmet snacks, if you like.<br /><br />In character and consistency, I think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn Tortilla chip and a Wheat Thins cracker (though there is, in fact, no wheat in the ingredients). Lightly salted with just a hint of Olive and Garlic. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea. If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, "No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors". 10% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost. But a few words must be devoted to their monetary price. For about 18 bucks you'll get 24 ounces of these - about 75 cents per ounce. Last week, I bought a 17.5 ounce bag of Ruffles for $3.49 - about 20 cents per ounce. That's quite a differential. Whether you're willing to shell out the extra cash for a non-essential snack will depend on your tastes, your priorities and your pocketbook.

review/summary: An All Natural Winner
review/text: Though I like to try and use all natural foods, I will not sacrifice flavor just to "go natural". From the 1st mini-chip to the last in one of the 1 oz snack-sized bags, I was entirely satisfied and will definitely buy these. I started eating the chips plain and, from the 1st bite, found the multigrain flavor satisfingly strong with a just a hint of sweetness that took the edge off the grain flavor. The size and shape of the chips (more like crackers than larger tortilla chips) was good for snacking, plus the thickness provided just the right texture and "crunch" factor.<br /><br />Later I finished the chips with a pesto dip and the complementary flavors worked perfectly: the chip didn't over power the dip, but neither did it roll over and die. I am sure I would enjoy these tortilla chips with other dips.<br /><br />Finally a last observation is how well these mini-chips kept their original shape. Out of the entire (albeit small) bag, only 1-2 chips were broken.<br /><br />An all natural winner that will have a permanent spot on my households snack-food roster.

If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, "No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors". 11% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost.

review/summary: Tasty fatty corny
review/text: These chips have a great taste and if you keep it in the front of your mind you can taste the green olives. I don't know how much olive gets into the chips but just knowing some was in them made them taste fattier to me. (Each serving is 11% of your recommended daily fat.) The main ingredients are white and yellow corn.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: These chip/crackers were very tasty... however people who have allergies or problems digesting corn - like me - need to beware. If you just read the front of the packet it seems as if they are made without wheat or corn. Not true, the main ingredient is corn.

review/summary: Very good, and Healthy
review/text: I'm into eating healthy, but I didn't expect these chips to taste this good, and be Healthy!! WOW.<br /><br /> A hint of Garlic, and just enough salt, to draw you back, to take another, and another etc. I did't taste the Olive taste as much as others did, but I would buy these when I see them at my Store.<br /><br />They are crispy, and would be great for a dip, or just eat them as a snack.<br />Good in a child lunch bag, then the fried high fat other chips.<br /><br />No Trans fat, no chols, no preservatives, No GMO, no fake coloring or fake Flavorings.<br /><br /> One oz. Serving:<br />140 Cal. Sat fat 0.5.. no sugar, sodium 80mg. Carbs 18g, Protien 2g<br /><br />Two thumbs up.

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: Wow, the olive flavor socked me from the first bite. GREAT flavor. A little more unusual for a tortilla chip, which is what I like about it.<br /><br />There's a nice, very subtle hint of garlic there, too, which gives it a bit of pinch. (Not punch, just pinch)<br /><br />Very fresh right out of the bag, nice small sized chip.<br /><br />The olive flavor was overpowered by any dips or salsas. It tastes best to me plain, but then again, I tend to like vanilla flavored ice cream. To each his own--I'd definitely suggest trying this with hummus.<br /><br />Ingredients: Stone ground white corn, high oleic sunflower oil, black olives, green olives, sugarcane fiber, garlic powder, sea salt.<br /><br />One serving: 1 oz., one package, 140 calories

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: These are wonderful chips that really do taste like what they say, olives! If you like a very crispy thin chip packed with wonderful olivey goodness and subtle garlic then try these they are awsome! I first tried this companies products from Costco where I purchased their multi grain chips. I was hooked from the first bite and like them even better then the olive ones but they are both excellent chips. They are not too salty either which is another reason I love them. The grainy taste is nutty and a little sweet and addictive. The little bags were not enough I was left wanting more but on the other hand the little bags are safer to have around! You will love these I promise!

review/summary: Healthy alternative
review/text: Before opening this package I read the ingrediants and daily values. There was an advantage in the lack of saturated fats which was pleasing to me. I had the Olive flavored variety. I found the chips to be tasty but a little dry and lacking the olive flavor I had expected. I THOUGHT I tasted an olive experience in the first bite but did not taste it again. By saying I thought it was dry may have been the thought that the product may have been a little old OR had the same sensation in my mouth as stale varieties I have bitten into in the past. Was pleasing enougha but I can't honestly say I would purchase again.

review/summary: Here's the chips
review/text: I tried the multigrain chips without any dip or cheese.  The flavors were minimally pleasant and reminded me of the chips on airlines flights when the choice is chips or pretzels.  I will not make a point to buy these chips if alternatives are available at similar comparable prices.<br /><br />The best chip currently available is the Lant Chips on your Amazon.com site.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQ58XO">Original LantChips, Salted, 1.5-Ounce Bag, (Pack of 28)</a>
