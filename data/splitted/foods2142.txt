review/summary: wierd and not that good.  kind of oddly tangy and fatty at the same time
review/text: weird and not that good. its got a sort weird sort of chemical saltiness and odd tangy thing going on. and then there's the gross cold bacon fat mouth feel.  its better if you wipe it off with a paper towel.  I wondered why nobody had made bacon jerky.  Checked amazon, found a supplier, and now know the answer.

review/summary: Bad product,Bad customer service!
review/text: These candies arrived in a timely manner.  I was very excited to open them as they were to be a Christmas Present for my father.<br /><br />I opened the box to find a paper cup and smashed sticky candy mess in a plastic baggie.  It looked like they ran out of the size box I ordered,  took a larger box or multiple smaller boxes, grabbed the pieces out of the box they came in dumped them in a plastic bag.  It was disgusting!  I have contacted them twice by e-mail (their preferred method)  they have yet to respond.<br /><br />I am not happy with the product or the customer service.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: I'd gotten these for my dad, who is diabetic and really loved chocolate covered cherries.  He loves them so much he says they're his favorite sugar or non.  I tried them and can say that, in my opinion at least, they still have that odd texture and slight aftertaste that all sugar free candy I've eaten has, but of the sugar free candies I've tried it's definitely the best...the cherry in the middle is really fantastic and juicy.<br />The ONLY reason I'm not giving this the full 5 stars is because of what the other reviewer has said.  It doesn't come in a box, but rather each one arrives just like the picture there looks with just that paper on the bottom and stuffed into a plastic bag.  Mine all arrived in one piece, but I could easily have seen how they could have gotten pretty damaged in shipping.  When mine came half of them had rolled out of their papers and had to be put back in.  So on the whole it's hard to give this as a gift.

review/summary: Taste good, Very poor packaging
review/text: I sent these as a gift, which was a mistake, because The cherries came in a flimsy, white cardboard box rather than something at least decorative, like you would expect (like from Harry and David). Some of the chocolates were melted and so the interior of the box was a bit of a stucky mess. They tasted good but I wouldn't order them again.

review/text: I ordered these for my mom for Christmas.  She is a diabetic so sugar is something she has to watch closely. They wernt packaged well as they were shoved in to a small flat rate priority box with no bubble protection or any kind of protection at all. i was disapointed in the packaging but the product is delicious. I cant believe they are sugar free but they are.  They are a bit pricey and i'll never understand why sugar free has to be so much more expensive then regular but all in all, its a great product and the taste is awesome !

This is the only Gerber food we have ever had this type of problem with.

review/summary: Nice, but not filling :-l
review/text: I love to eat this for breakfast in the summer, because it's light and good when you are watching your weight.  However, I personally find that for me, I have to add a banana to it or I'm hungry in a little over an hour.  It is a tiny bit bland in flavour, so I guess adding a banana is a good thing anyway because it gives it an extra flavour boost.<br />Overall, this is good for a light start to the day, but I think it's the type of cereal you'd get bored of if you ate it day after day after day.  I alterate this with either different cereals, or toast.

review/summary: Perfect for adding flavor to dry food. Our little dog loves this stuff
review/text: I don't know a lot about dogs but I thought they ate anything. The dachshund we had growing up would eat banana peels if you left them out. We rescued a Maltese (5 years ago now) and while he is healthy, he eats when he's hungry and leaves the rest.  He's never like doggy treats, bones etc. and prefers human food/meat to anything for dogs. Since I've read dry food is best for dogs we feed him dry but again, he eats when hungry but doesn't lick his chops. Cesar is the best dog food I've found to add to the dry for taste. We get at least 4 feedings from one container, which make it pretty cheap. We simply mix a spoonful into the dry food for flavor and he's got the best of both worlds. If I could find a dry food tasty enough to be served solo, I would buy it but he eats such a small amount of food I don't mind making it tasty.

First, the only thing one really has to do to sell dog food is make it so the dogs will eat it.  That the dog will eat it is no measure of the quality or benefit of the food.

review/summary: We're both happy at long last!
review/text: I have two dogs, but only one of them eats Cesar chicken "in meaty juices" (it HAS to be the "in meaty juices kind!) and she GOBBLES IT. after years of searching for a food she'll eat to enjoy, not just eat to survive, we've finally found a winner!<br /><br /> Gigi is a 9-year-old Papillon mix who is both dainty, firecely independent, and plain fierce when she's disturbed, while 1-year-old Mini-Dachshund Sophie is a happy, bouncy, and utterly addicted to attention. Gigi spends her time under the bed, Sophie is wherever I am. What Sophie eats is actually still TBD. This is Gigi's review.<br /><br />Both of them have been picky eaters. Gigi went years on starving herself until she couldn't hold out any longer, then deigning to eat the dry food we supply between wet food dinners, even as we tried all kinds of different foods to tempt her. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KH02I">Beneful Dog Food Prepared Meals Beef Stew Dog Food, 10-Ounce Plastic Containers (Pack of 8)</a> used to work now and then, and though it was expensive, we could get 3 servings from it. However, even though it had a lid, it would often grow moldy even before the next meal. So even though she liked it, it was wasted and really too expensive anyway.<br /><br />When Sohpie arrived, we'd been serving <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJF62Y">Mighty Dog Hearty Pulled-Style Chicken Dinner In Gravy, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> with the longest sustained success yet, about a year. Only chicken, mind you, and it had to be the chunky in sauce kind, NOT the pate kind. Well, along came the puppy, and Gigi expressed her distaste by wasting food again.<br /><br />Finally, I've found Cesar. And oddly, now it has to be the p�t&eacute; kind, I.e. "in meaty juices" NOT the chunky kind! But AT LAST we've found a dog food that The Mrs. will absolutely SNARF ON. She doesn't come up for air when I put any chicken-based "in meaty juices" Cesar dinner in front of her, which I cube into bite sizes.<br /><br />The added bonus is that I can hide pills in the cubes. Gigi's been diagnosed with congenital heart failure, and she's on 3 different pills, 3 times a day. Dinner is the easier dose, because I just push the little pills into the soft p�t&eacute;, and she's none the wiser because she swallows the cubes almost whole! Sadly, we won't probably have Gigi with us for the fourteen or fifteen years I've been blessed to have spent with my previous dogs. But I'm determined to make sure she's as healthy and happy as possible in the time we have. She may be feisty, prickly, and a loner, but when I *can* catch her, she does love to snuggle with her mama.<br /><br />Cesar "in nearby juices" dog food might just give me a few month's more snuggled than we'd otherwise have.

My solution has been to buy Cesar by the case from Amazon (auto shipment) and mix it with his dry. I buy dry food for small adult dogs, mix a scoop (1 cup?) with 1/4-1/3 container of Cesar. I mix it with a for or my hands (so he doesn't just eat the Cesar and walk away). He gets the benefit of dry food for his teeth etc and the tastiness of Cesar's wonderful flavors.

review/summary: WONDERFUL!!!
review/text: I have ordered countless times from this company and I am in the process of placing another order.  I buy a variety of seasoning so I can make my own blend.  I just finished making several bottles of seasoning and rubs and I still have the scent on my hands even after washing my hands.  The seasoning is fresh and six months to a year later, the seasoning still holds the aroma and flavor of each seasoning and spice that I have ordered.  I have ordered this season in which I am reviewing as well as countless other seasoning and I am thoroughly happy with each of my orders. It is true that it has more garlic than the lemon but in the ingredients, it lists garlic first which means that it is supposed to have more garlic.  Order a lot so the shipping balances out to nearly free.

review/summary: This is garlic powder, not lemon pepper.
review/text: Good thing I like garlic powder because it will get used.  However, I paid what I consider to be a high price for this product because it claimed to have lemon/pepper in it.  I thought the garlic base was a good idea and a good substitute for all the salt in other lemon/pepper seasonings.  But I expected, from the label, that there would be the taste of lemon and pepper.  If you like garlic, this is okay although not really that garlicky either.  If you like lemon pepper, this won't do it for you.  There is zero lemon or pepper taste in this product, and I have verified this with several family members.  I only rated it even 1 star because you have to click on at least 1 star to put in a review.

review/text: I do cat rescue work, which means I get to keep the special needs cats.  Most of my gang is over 12 years old.  I started them on this because it sounded like a better cat food than the commercial stuff I find on sale, and the money for it was in the same ballpark.  Since I have put all 15 on this food the "Hawking up Hairballs" has went down to a small fracture of what it has been for years.  And they eat much less, which means litter boxes are not as busy, and they are more healthy.  Its a good deal for me, and a great deal for their health!  For the price, its the best I can find!  And I would know after 30 years of cat rescue.

review/text: It pains me to have to disagree with reviewer K.Wessel. The information in that review is incorrect. This product is healthy for cats. Maybe not so for humans, but healthy for the digestive tract of a cat. My five year old Siamese neutered male is stupendously healthy, satisfied and very happy. He has maintained his exact weight for three consecutive years. We have his vet records to back up these statements. His vet is happy, his mom is happy, and best of all he (Tu'i Tonga) is happy. If you have questions, please consult your vet. A cats digestive needs are much different than a humans. The ingredients may sound awful to us, but it's not our health we should be concerned with when buying pet food.

When he got back to having an appetite (no amount of treats or special foods would tempt him) he went back to chowing down on the GoodLife Recipe food, and regained all the lost weight and muscles he had lost.

review/summary: My 3 cats eat it...  guess it's good.
review/text: My three cats seem to really like this cat food, although I think they would be happy with any cat food.  Every feeding they act as if I never feed them.  As a pet owner I looked more at price and quality.  Decent price, decent quality.  I am on the fence weather I like this product or the new Purina One Beyond better for my cats.  I think I will stick with The Goodlife Recipe primarily because it is cheaper through amazon and it is just a lot easier to have food automatically at my doorstep when I need it.  Believe me, you don't want to run out with three cats swooping around like vultures at food time!  If amazon starts carrying the Beyond with Subscribe and Save, I could be swayed.<br /><br />In the past, when my oldest cat was younger, I would buy the cheapest cat food money could buy.  This caused him to be over-weight and his coat was dull and he just didn't look good.  Once I got him to a normal weight with a high protein food of Purina One Healthy Weight Formula, I began looking for a lower price food to maintain this new lower weight.  They have been eating this food for over 6 months now and coats are great and all three cats look very healthy.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because, although it is a decent food, I know there are better out there, just not as convenient as this item on amazon in my price range.

review/summary: Healthy Food For Our Feline Friends
review/text: When my parents first got their cat, they tried every cat food brand - dry or wet - it didn't matter, their cat would not eat more than a few bites.  Then they discovered The Goodlife.  That is all their pampered cat eats.<br /><br />A few years ago, when I adopted my lil feline buddy from the shelter, I wanted the best for her.  I tried the expensive, all-protein brands, but my cat would have various stomach issues.  I finally switched her over to The Goodlife and again, voila!  For the past 2 years, that is all she ever eats (plus her treats).<br /><br />Currently, I also am a caretaker for a feral cat colony in my condo complex and feed them a combination of the store brand stuff and The Goodlife.  They are healthier and more lively than I could possibly hope for.<br /><br />Plus, with Amazon's Shop N Save program, I never run out of food for my feline best-friend.

review/text: I have two boys...well first we had one. He was a little panther zipping and yowling around our house and would anything, especially bagels...I still can't keep bagels in my house. Then we decided he need a playmate. That's when we came across Octavious or "silky" as his current human called him. And he was silky, such much so in comparison our first cat felt like velcro when petted. We couldn't afford Science diet and they seemed to hate the plain taste of it. We started mixing the good life with it and we have noticed more energy, more love from them and softer shiny coats. Less itchiness too.<br /><br />Yes it has corn, but guess what so does half the things you eat. I am not concerned on wheat/corn debate as my cat goes after my bread, my bagels or anything tasting like wheat.

review/summary: Very Happy with it!
review/text: We have 4 cats a little over 1 year old. We started out feeding them Blue Buffalo but they were always very gassy and 2 of the cats were getting plump.. while another was too skinny. So we ventured into trying other brands healthy or otherwise. They can be a bit picky but they eventually got used to anything. "Their" favorite was the Purina stuff... but that's just like us loving junk food isn't it...while the 1 skinny one did attain a normal weight the 2 plump ones became quite fat! So eventually we picked up this Goodlife brand, for indoor cats. They took to it well and before we knew it the 2 fat cats are down to a healthy weight. The skinny cat is looking a little skinnier too but she has maintained a healthy weight with this stuff. It's been about 5 months now and they are all still very healthy and I am very Happy with this brand and this particular recipe (indoor). It has been a perfect balance for all 4 of our cats. We did try the all ages a couple of times but it doesn't seem to satisfy them as well and they eat a lot more of it.

review/summary: Mixed feelings
review/text: I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste.

However, in my opinion, this is a great middle of the road more natural cat food. Our cats love it and haven't had any problems digesting it.<br /><br />We have 2 cats that are a year old. We adopted them from a shelter 4 months ago. When they were babies they got a virus and as a result have sensitive stomachs. I had to find a food for them with not a lot of fillers and dyes. Particularly the red dye found in most cat foods. The foster home gave them Purina Naturals which was more expensive then Goodlife so I am very happy I found this brand of food. I am a realistic common sense cat owner on a budget so price had to be a factor especially with 2 cats. I admit I didn't know anything about corn and other stuff in cat food. The ingredients in this cat food hasn't had any negative affects on our cats. In fact they have a soft shiny coat, very seldom get hair balls, and are full of energy.<br /><br />I always had cats growing up that ate just regular cat food and they lived to be old. In fact my one cat is 13 years old now. I don't understand why all of a sudden people are so critical of cat food. There are certainly worse cat foods out there with a lot of fillers and dyes that in some cases can be more expensive. I recommend giving this food a try and let your cat decide if he/she likes it.

review/summary: Great choice of food, no stomach sensitivities
review/text: One of my cats is 17 years old and I rescued her from the outdoors.  She had a rough life before I had her.  Over the years I've fed her premium brands and a few regular brands.  I tried this food after I first saw the commercial and I've never had to switch to any other since.  I like this food because all 3 of my cats like it and they don't have any sensitivities to it.  The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.  But I think all food has to have some preservatives in them so they are able to be packaged for sale in dry form.  So how can even the purest foods with preservatives in them really be any better than this one?  I don't feel as though I'm shortening my cats' life span feeding them this brand.  Hey, 17 years and still kickin' is enough proof to me.  I give The Goodlife Recipe two thumbs up!!

review/summary: Cats keep it down
review/text: My cats love this cat food.  It is the only cat food that I have ever used that they seem to digest well. There is seldom any "throw up" with this cat food.  Anyone who owns a cat knows what I mean about this.  I used to call my cats the "throw up queens" but since I've been using this cat food it very seldom happens.  They have been eating this cat food for over 2 years so I think this is a good test.  I highly recommend.

review/text: I have tried numerous dry cat foods, but the one my cats like best is the Goodlife Recipe! Not sure if it's the yummy aroma, or just the sound of it being poured into their bowls, but they sure come running!  I feed our cats canned food, but always have a bowl of dry food available. Some of our cats prefer dry food, and this recipe is a winner! I like the fact that it's high in protein and has fiber and veggies too.<br />Try it- you won't be disappointed!!<br />Pricing on Amazon is great, the automatic delivery is a godsend- and free delivery is a winner!

review/text: we have successfully been feeding our 2 cats this for about 6 months now comparing this brand to similar brand in this category I would say it exceeds all expectations it is not a high priced <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XKCCV2">Blue Buffalo Indoor Cat Dry Food, Chicken and Brown Rice Recipe, 15-Pound Bag</a> such as that one at 3 dollars a pound but it is a very reasonable middle of the road cat food for about the same price as cheap cat food so that being said my wife and I are both extremely satisfied with our purchase

review/summary: Pooptacularly Bad
review/text: I tried this cat food for my 5 month old kitten.  we used this for about two weeks thinking that her stomach would get used to it.  We were wrong.  This cat food made our cat crap like a 300 pound man.  And my gosh did it stink.  This cat food turned our cute little fur ball into a feline ball of gas that you no longer wanted on your lap or for that matter in our house.  I kid you not, after two weeks of this cat food the cat's butthole was actually protruding.  We went back to the cat food we were giving her before and within two weeks she was back to normal.<br /><br />Never again.

review/summary: Corn?? Really??
review/text: My two cats are both over 10 yrs of age - and they are different in how they eat - but one thing is for sure - they don't and can't digest CORN!!!  My Russian Blue cat, Katie - got sick EVERY TIME she ate. They don't get outside - so they needed more protein in the diet - and even though it seems like a good food ( I was hook line and sinker too) - it is not worth it when my cats are constantly throwing up five minutes after eating it.  So - it was time for a change.  Read your labels carefully!!  They need MEAT - PROTEIN! - not corn!

review/summary: It's Corn. Cats can't live on corn.
review/text: This food is primarily corn: ground corn and corn meal. That food pyramid above the cat's head definitely doesn't represent what's in the food. I don't think most people would knowingly go out and buy corn for their cat. We associate cats with eating fish or poultry or mice. Definitely not ears of corn.<br /><br />And most of the meat is a byproduct, which is a low grade and questionable ingredient. So is "animal fat." It also contains wheat, which cats can easily be allergic to. This brand may be better than the bottom of the barrel cat foods, but it's still something to totally avoid. Purchase a cat food that is low in grains/carbs or has none at all. If it contains any then they should be wholegrain, like brown rice. No corn or byproducts.<br /><br />Your cat may seem fine on this food, but like a person eating fast food at every meal, you have to know there are healthier options out there and such poor dietary choices will catch up with you sometime.

review/text: Once again , clueless consumers that feed their cats nearly inedible corn, glutens, and by-products, none of which are good for your animals.  Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom -  think again.  This is one of the worst foods out there along with meow mix, science diet, friskies, most purina products.<br />Would you let your kids eat french fries and fritos for all their meals?  this is pretty much the same thing for your cats.<br />Read the labels -  main ingredients should be meat, not corn, not byproducts.  Glutens are allergens and used as filler and should be avoided.  Look around, there are affordable good foods available -  some warehouse clubs sell their brands which are very good (starts with a "C").  Check pet food ratings, dot net.<br /><br />Ignorance is no excuse for torturing your animals with terrible food

review/text: I fed this to my three cats. Within a month one of them began getting sick, throwing up his food once a day then every meal. Eventually he began throwing up blood and was passing it from his bottom. We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.<br />We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice. Days later we gave him a little bit of the dry cat food with his special food. Hours later he was terribly sick again. It was then that we realized the food made him this deathly ill!<br />DO NOT BUY GOODLIFE it almost killed our cat!

review/summary: Delectable, Filling Cookies With Low Calories Make a Healthy Snack
review/text: These are are crunchy, delectable cookies that come in a variety of flavors, of which, I find The Original & Gingerspice tastier than others. What I find very puzzling is that Amazon has different flavors under Amazon Prime at different times: last week it was The Original and now it is Gingerspice and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FJCXX6">Almondina Almonduo with Pistachio Biscuits, 4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>. Almondina also makes an assorted 8 cookie flavor giftbox but for some Amazon does not carry it, as of February 2010.<br /><br />Each cookie has 35 calories and the package lists the serving size as 4 cookies. For me, usually 2 cookies are filling enough and satisfy my hunger. Cookies have roasted almonds and resins. Each cookie has 5.5 gm carbohydrate approximately half of which is sugar, but the company claims it to be "All Natural". I guess they consider sugar to be natural!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FFK40">Biscoff Family Pack</a> are also delicious cookies, with 25 calorie per cookie and roughly the same amount of carbohydrates and sugar per cookie as Almondina, but they are't as filling and you end up consuming more calories. May be it is not possible to make delicious cookies with any less sugar. To give you perspective and comparison, Oreo Cookies have double the sugar and carbohydrate and each serving has 160 calories; and they are not filling so you end up consuming a lot more than one serving at a time. I have't found any other delicious cookies with as low carbohydrate content as Almondina. For me, they make a very healthy snack that satiates my hunger and craving for food.

review/summary: Don't be afraid of the dark...
review/text: Ok, I'll come out of the closet and admit: I've tried to get used to it, but will never completely embrace a love for very, very dark chocolate. So sue me. It's just too bitter. Too lacking in that luxuriant creaminess which makes me adore milk chocolate -- which for afficianados of "real" chocolate, really ain't chocolate at all. Oh, and don't forget the whole cause du jour of the "MUFA's" thing...monounsaturated fats. The stuff that's good for you, I've heard.<br /><br />THIS stuff is the next best thing. The chili adds a wonderful bit of heat. Just right. The chocolate is slightly less than 50% "dark", if I get the gist of the nutrition label. For me - the perfect blend: enough dark to please someone who eats it for health reasons (like THAT was ever why we fell in love with chocolate)...while retaining that lovely, melt-in-your-mouth-feel only something with enough fat can offer.<br /><br />Heaven in small bites paired with something I relish as I write this: an equally non-snobular red table wine -- Kendall Jackson's deeeelish "Summation" (heavier than my beloved Chianti, lighter than Merlot. In short, luscious perfection and balance. When I'm not sure what wine to bring, I can always rely on a KJ!)<br /><br />Afraid of the dark? Fear not. Lindt's Excellence Chili Dark just might tempt you away from the light.

review/summary: High Quality Pain.
review/text: This is one kicker of a drink. My mother bought this for me as a present because she knows that I like both spicy and vodka. Well, her intentions were true, and it is a thoughtful gift, but I just cannot handle the flavor. I need to find a few good recipes for this to drink it, as anything I have mixed it with leaves it too spicy. Straight is brutal. I took a shot straight, and the vodka stripped away my saliva (my spicy protection layer) and the capsaicin dug in deep. It tastes so good, but the spice is like a sucker punch right in the jollies. Buy this if you don't plan to use it as a main feature in your mixed drinks, or you need a good spirit for doing bets. I hope you enjoy it!

review/summary: Belcolade, the forgotten premium chocolate.
review/text: I recently purchased some unsweetened Belcolade chocolate in place of the usual Callebaut that I order. I love Callebaut, but it is very difficult to cut due to the thickness of the giant bars. The chipped version available through some vendors is an inferior product. Thus, I tried Belcolade. It is much darker than Callebaut and has a more earthy flavor characteristic of "Dutching." However, it is better and more complex than other dutched chocolates like Lindt. I would rate it as high as Callebaut and Valrhona and certainly better than Ghirardelli and the expensive Sharffenberger. Best of all, The Belcolade is delivered in small wafers and required no cutting, just measuring in a cup. It saves me a great deal of time and mess. Also, the price is right and less than virtually every other ultra premium brand.

review/summary: My Little One loves this food.
review/text: My kitten loves this food.  It was the food that she had when she was at the shelter and my vet carries the Hill Science Diet Line for both dogs and cats.  She rushes to her bowl when she hears the dry kitten food falling into her bowl.

review/summary: New Kitten Loves It
review/text: Healthy food and kitten gobbles it down.  I personally like the approach Science Diet takes to balanced nutritional, even if the food is not all organic or natural.  Good product, great price, and kitty loves the food!

review/text: I bought this for an elderly cat with health problems who needs to gain weight, coincidentally I have a new kitten as well. All 4 of my cats love this food, none like the wet food. This is now their forever food.

review/summary: Pretty Good, there are better choices for some.
review/text: This food is much better than cheap store brand type kibble, however while a cut above most it still has ingredients that I would not see in the Premium Brands such as Wellness, Ivo and such.<br />For the increase in price from the cheap stuff it is much better for the little sweeties. It is a very good compromise.<br />I foster kittens all the time and most of them love the stuff and their coats are very shiny.

review/text: My two kittens have sensitive stomachs so my Vet recommended Science Diet. It helped them and I could not be any more pleased. It is worth the price to see the results of happy pets that are healthy.

review/summary: Kitten loves it.
review/text: We have a somewhat finicky 5 month old kitten.  He hates most of the canned kitten food available, including other Science Diet canned kitten food. Until he's a year old, we want to feed him appropriate kitten food.  Our vets tout the benefits of Science Diet food for cats, so we thought we'd try the Salmon.  It comes in a small can, which is perfect for one or two kittens, and he absolutely loves the taste.  Win-win situation for us! We bought two cases which will last for several months.

review/summary: Lots of vitamins, but not filling
review/text: I fed this to my kittens by recommendation of my vet. They gave me several coupons that made it quite inexpensive.<br /><br />It's packed with a lot of vitamins. My childhood pets were always fed it, and they lived to 14 years or so, and so I thought it would be good for my kittens.<br /><br />Their fur was glossy and they appeared healthy, but they were always hungry after eating their assigned portion. I switched to an organic human-grade kibble and the kittens were contented after their portions. This told me that the food must have been filling the cats up, but not substantially enough to keep them full. Just as a human could fill up on rice and chicken nuggets and vitamins (the human equivalents of some of the ingredients) and be healthy, but not really feel contented in their bellies.<br /><br />This is less expensive than the organic food I buy them now, but they want to eat more so I don't know what the end cost really is. I like the idea of all of the vitamins in there, just as I would take a multi-vitamin, but I just wish that their bellies could keep full after eating. I probably won't go back to this kibble. I wish I could rate it higher for the vitamins, but these corn meal and by-product ingredient listings really explain my kittens lack of feeling full.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Lots of vitamins<br />* Left fur glossy<br /><br />CONS:<br />* Always begging for more food<br />* Corn meal and chicken by-products near the top of ingredient list (poor quality, not human grade)

review/summary: My cats really like it
review/text: Fortunately, my kittens have had no ill behaviors while eating this food like the previous reviewers cat. I mixed this in with my Purina Kitten Chow that my kittens were eating and the kittens seemed to really love it. My other two, one year old cats were also fond of "stealing" the kittens dry food instead of their usual Iams (where real chicken is the main ingredient), so this must be tasty. Usually, I just feed my cats dry food on a free choice basis and supplement with canned cat food and boiled chicken meat. My only gripe is this isn't a dry food that someone on a strict budget could likely readily afford on a regular basis for a number of cats. Otherwise, this is a good quality kitten food.

review/summary: Not a very good food.
review/text: My view of this product has changed since we have been feeding Halo; the cats seem healthier and happier.  The kitten's coat was getting very rough and now is smooth and silky.  I'm told that you should feed the best you can afford, and this food is expensive, but not very high-quality, as far as we could tell.  Plus, our kitten gained too much weight on it.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Addictive, empty filler, but my cat went anorexic without it
review/text: My older cat, 4 years, got "hooked" on Hill's Science Diet Kitten formula when I brought a new kitten, along with a big bag of free S/D, home from the pound. [Prior to that, my well-adjusted cat would eat raw chicken, high quality canned foods, organic kibble--all the "good stuff"]<br /><br />Both cats thrived on S/D.  So much so that the kitten grew and grew and grew, into a hefty 9 pounds at 7 months. The 4 year-old cat began ignoring her own food and started eating the kitten's food.  She filled out, also, but to a nice adult weight of 6 pounds.<br /><br />Okay, so 2 months later the kitten is up to 10 pounds and can barely walk without panting.  She cannot stop eating this S/D stuff.  She's enormous, way bigger than her 4 year-old housemate.  I decide to switch back to the healthier food--like Innova Evo, which is 88% meat protein and grain free.  I also augment with superior wet food (the 100% organic, human grade stuff, along with raw chicken, etc).<br /><br />Kitten is okay with that switch--like a tiger she tears away at the raw chicken, gulps at the premium can food--but the older cat doesn't like it, although I do it very gradually over 3 months.  I sit with her, pet her, calm her...Yes, she does eat, just not much--a few kibble crunches, or a tablespoon of wet food.  [Cornell has over 300 studies on anorexic cats].<br /><br />A couple months go by and the kitten is looking better, not panting as much (and  2 pounds lighter) but our 4 year-old cat is now down to 2.9 pounds!  All her ribs show and she has bones where her shoulders are.  She looks like a cheetah that's been deprived of food.  No mater what food I put in front of her--dry, wet, kibble, shredded meat--she will only nibble bits and pieces, here and there.  Her fur has lost its glossy coat.<br /><br />The vet tells me I have to do something, anything, to stop the decline in my cat's health, even if it means feeding the crummy Science Diet Kitten food, Original Formula.<br /><br />I am two days into feeding the cat the S/D Kitten food.  She is wolfing this stuff down as if there's no tomorrow.  It makes me sad that she's become another S/D addict--it's that darn corn filler, converts to sugar and cats love it.  I know, I'd rather have her alive and eating this crud, then wasting to nothing away on more nourishing food.  At least I can console myself that the kitten KNOWS she's a feline and eats like one.

review/summary: My cats won't eat it
review/text: I was sent a bag of this with a litter of kittens I am fostering. At first I thought perhaps the kittens were just more interested in wet food, because they wouldn't eat this stuff. Then they discovered my own personal cats' food (a much, much less expensive brand), and they were grubbing on it! My own cats turned up their noses at the Science Diet, too.<br /><br />It may be fabulously nutritious, but that doesn't really matter if my cats refuse to touch it.<br /><br />My dog liked it, though.
