review/summary: WONDERFUL but....
review/text: (My very first review...)<br /><br />What I got is different (but better) than the Reed's Ginger Candy picture. This yummy chews comes in a bulk-box of 20 small boxes, and each small box contain 10 candies making a total of 200 candies. Each candy / chew is wrap in an **edible** rice paper and then in a wax paper. I'm very impress with the whole packaging, and the edible rice paper is a nice surprise. I hate those inner-wrapper that comes with most candies making eating-candy a messy experience. The candies are very addictive. The only small complain I have is that the ginger-taste is too mild for me. If you are getting this for morning / motion sickness or migraine, this may not be a good choice. I would recommend crystallized ginger. Hopefully, the Reed's crystallized ginger candies are not this mild. My favor is W&M Ginger Glace but can't find it online.

review/summary: Chewy healthy treat
review/text: I thoroughly enjoy this product.  It soothes my throat, and I believe has a calming effect on my nerves.  I dont have to take an aspirin, or anything stronger if I feel a little upset, as I do when I have to drive on the highway, for example.  I put one of the chews in the roof of my mouth and let the essence flow into my mouth and throat.  I am calmed and ready to roll.  It's better than a cough drop too.

review/summary: Awesome candy
review/text: Based on the reviews I tried these, and I LOVE them. I've tried the other ginger chews made by the ginger people, but these are far superior. I've had the ginger people chews for months and haven't come close to finishing the package. I've had the Reed's ginger candy for a couple of days and I've already finished my first pack. If you like ginger then you will really like these. I know it may be a splurge, but it's worth it. You get 20 packs with each package containing 10 individually wrapped candies. My only problem is going to be in pacing my consumption of this yummy treat.

review/text: I eat almost no sugar, but I have one of these after dinner, and they seem to settle my stomach. They can be very sticky and difficult to get out of the wrappers, but I solve this by keeping the box in the freezer. The candy pops right out and melts quickly when I put them in my mouth. I've been getting them at Kroger, and their price is about the same, but I may buy this 20 pack just for the convenience.

review/summary: Great anti-nausea candy!
review/text: First off this candy is spectacularly tasty. It's chewy, spicy, and has a coating of powdered sugar. The texture is great. If you like ginger anything, especially ginger beer, these will certainly be a winner.<br /><br />Second though, I carry these in my bag all the time. If you ever have sudden nausea or indigestion chewing one or two of these will clear things right up. I hate feeling queasy in class or a meeting, but now I never do. It really is a miracle and I didn't have to buy any pricey (and foul tasting) drugs. Chewing these works better than pepto bismol for settling a stomach.<br /><br />I can't recommend these enough.

There's something more satisfying about a treat that lingers in your mouth for a few minutes while you chew it.<br /><br />Reed's Ginger Candy Chews are great because they have the zing of real ginger and the wonderful chewy consistency that reminds me of a good caramel. At 25 calories per piece, they are a great low-calorie dessert that helps to settle the tummy and clean the palate.<br /><br />I love these candies!

review/summary: Pasta from Umbria like you find there
review/text: We had strangozzi pasta in Spoleto some time ago. This brand by a small farm and factory near Perugia is so good we keep needing more. This kind of pasta is unusual in that you're not supposed to stir it for the entire time it cooks in boiling water. We added it to a truffle sauce, but once we had it with a spicy tomato sauce. Either way, the pasta is so good you don't really need much to dress it up.  It's good even with just some olive oil and pecorino cheese or something like that. It's one of the best pastas we have ever had. Absolutely hands down delicious!

review/text: This was one of those afternoons when I was all alone and needed a quick afternoon lunch. So I opened a can of Amy's Organic Lentil and Vegetable Soup and added some crackers and a drink. It worked out well. The soup was thick and hearty and tasted rather well. If I had a complaint, I thought the soup to be a little bland. So I added a few squirts of Frank's Hot Sauce, one of my all-purpose brighteners, and that worked very well. It had a lot of fiber, was fairly low in sodium and sugars. The protein content was moderate. It made a good lunch, but not a great lunch.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: This is my favorite baby food line by far. They are consistent and readily available at just about any store. We got this variety pack on Amazon after already purchasing it from local stores. This is a great price compared to most stores and the variety of flavors is great. I wish they had more variety packs available for stage 3, but compared to other products out there it is hard to complain.<br /><br />Now I am just waiting for the day that earth's best moves away from glass jars. Our daughter has started grabbing these out of her diaper bag and if she drops them on our hard floors it will break the jars. I have broken a couple myself dropping them from the cupboard on to the granite counter tops. I really like the pouches that some lines are doing and even the plastic containers that Gerber does. Glass is great because it is recyclable, but so are the plastic ones if you live in an area that supports that or you can reuse them like we do for storing bulk spices. That is the only the con I have and it is not even big enough to rate this product any lower.<br /><br />For those of you that cannot tell what flavors you are getting, they are:<br />2 - Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal<br />2 - Chicken Tenders and Stars<br />2 - Vegetable Beef Pilaf<br />2 - Strawberry Banana

review/summary: Good for the price
review/text: At first, I loved Earths Best and it was about all I would buy. They dont taste bad and I love that they are organic but for stage three they are just not textured enough! All they have is a few chunks of carrot here or there. I will say that for the price and the size of each jar, there is still a value here and I will most likely stick to EB for stage 2 fruits but other than that I prefer Sprout baby food. It may be twice the price but in a chicken dish the first ingredient is chicken and I can honestly say I think it tastes good!

review/summary: 2 of 8 jars arrived broken BIG MESS (non returnable)
review/text: I really like Earth's Best Baby Foods and Amazon, but these jars were packaged so that glass touches glass... this may not be worth the good price.<br /> The jars arrived all wrapped up in bubble wrap, but 2 of the 8 jars were broken inside.

review/summary: baby soup
review/text: My son loves these soups particularly the butternut squash bisque. I'm a little confused that other reviewers said it lacked texture for a stage 3 food. It is soup people. Not even adult soup is necessarily chunky. I think it's a great transition from stage 2 to 3. I would also say that babies on stage 2 could probablyhandle these items.

review/summary: Great combo pack except strawberry and banana
review/text: I like all of the food in this combo except for strawberry and banana -- that does NOT seem like stage 3 food to me.  It is very thin and runny.  A food with this consistency does not belong with the others in this combo!  I really, really wish they would include a chunkier version.  It's enough to make me look into buying all the other foods in this pack individually.  Otherwise, this food is great, and I've had no trouble with broken jars, but I'm really frustrated by the runny strawberry/banana and it's enough to make me give 3 stars instead of 5, since it ruins the combo pack for me.

I did not want him to not limit him to just orange colored veggies as he wanted. Honestly tasting some of the other Brands green veggies I can understand why he didnt like them!!  I searched a few brands and we both like Earth Best the most.  He eats his green veggies without gagging AND even eats MEAT now!!  I could not get him to eat any other brand of meat.  He loves it now!!!<br />Great brand and I trust it as a parent that I am givin him quality food.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: WARNING: Almost all of these "soups" contain dairy product. I was unaware of this until the item arrived. Even then I did not realize it until I was I already feeding my daughter one of the "soups" and she didn't seem to like it. Usually I do read ingredients before using any product, but I'd never ran into a problem with Earths Best before. My Daughter has a dairy allergy and in general doesn't like anything that contains dairy. So when she seemed fussy about eaiting this, a red flag went up for me as she usually eats whatever I feed her. Better labeling with a dairy or milk content warning would be a plus, or if in the description it listed not only the types of "soups" in this variety pack, but also the ingredients. I can't say what a baby without a dairy allergy might think of this product, but mine wanted nothing to do with it.

review/summary: BPA in lids !!!
review/text: I was disappointed to find out that the LIDS of Earth's Best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains BPA :(<br />I thought I was avoiding the whole BPA issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers. If it's in the lids, it's going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging, shipping, storage, etc. I was planning on being a devoted Earth's Best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass, but then I found out about the BPA. As a note, if BPA doesn't bother you, most of Earth's Best food is tasty enough- but there are tastier out there, like Plum.

Unfortunately the broke during shipment. When they arrived and I opened the box I found a soggy cardboard pack of jars. I was afraid to even remove that plastic wrap to see which jars had broken or survived. I didn't want to risk spreading broken glass. So, Earth's Best food I am happy with. Ordering the jars online, not so great. I suggest sticking with the pouches when ordering baby food.

I tried to contact company and ask them why they use BPA, by the way BPA is not used in Canada and Europe for baby food, but they did not contact me. BPA has estrogenic effect, what can be the cause of obesity, there is evidence that BPA has effects on fetal and infant brain development and behavior.<br />Food itself is OK, but I can not understand how they can risk ours baby life and health by using BPA!??<br />Definitely, we should do something with that.

review/text: so we got this because it's organic, lots of veggies, etc all the things we think we should feed the baby.. but unfortunately it was a total waste of time and money.  my son would not eat it.  at all.  this is a little guy that will eat almost anything.  he's really not that picky at all.. if you saw him, you'd know, he's not thin!  but he would take a bite of this and spit it out, resulting in a lot of laundry and a lot of clean up in the kitchen!  i smelled and tasted it myself, and would have to agree that it's pretty gross.. and since we were stuck with this huge box of it, i tried everything, mixing it with fruit, dipping fruit / bread/ anything into it... and he would not eat it.  the earth's best jarred foods has a strange chemically taste / smell to it.  my son had no problem with any of the plum foods and i guess that's what we're sticking to now.  and to be honest, the plum tastes better to me as well.

review/summary: She picked out and ate only this food from her bowl
review/text: Okay so we are only on meal two with this food. I will update after a month of eating it. Thus far I have a feeling that this will be the food for her, and I will switch to the 30# bag after the change is completed and things are going smoothly.<br />Obviously I have not noticed any benefits (as we are still switching) but I will say this which makes me believe this is a keeper.<br />My 11# Bichon Frise has been on Royal Canine Mini Puppy, as I am a first time pet parent, and was told its a great food to be on. This entire time she has HATED her food, and I would have to get it wet in order for her to eat it. I was directed to dog food analysis dot com, and I believe this was a four or five star food, so I decided to give this food a try.<br />It finally arrived, and I gave my little Bailey a few pieces as treats, and she took them from me dry (a great sign). I then made her dinner and left the entire bowl dry, and she ate it, but what was interesting to me is at first she picked out the dry Artemis Fresh Mix and then came and looked at me as if to say "more of THAT stuff please"... so I wet the old food and she eventually ate it.<br />All in all I believe this will be a keeper, and I will update after she has been on it for a month or so.<br />Update:<br />We have officially finished the first bag of Artemis Fresh Mix. Since I have purchased the 15lb bag. There are a couple of differences since we switched over.<br />1. Bailey had THE WORST tear stains with the old food. They were so bad that when i used tear stain remover NOTHING happened... Since the switch her tear stains are down to a minimal, and I think it may be the tear stain from the prior food having to be wiped off, but I would not know for sure at this point.<br />2. Bailey finishes her food. She still mostly picks at it throughout the day, but she finishes ALL of her food by the end of the day.<br />3. Prior posters commented on less poop. I have to say we have had a complete opposite experience. This could be a result of the fact that she eats more, but it is hard to say. Also we still have mushy poop... I am not sure where this comes from. Since it has always been that way and she is completely healthy, I do not pay mind to this issue, nor does it deter me from continuing to purchase it. We may switch after this bag to another healthy brand to give her some variety and if there is any difference I will post it, but at this time I still love this food for her and I highly recommend it.

review/summary: This product saved my dog's life!
review/text: My dog is 4 years old, Jack Rusell Terrier. I have fed her Solid Gold Barking at the moon since she was puppy and had no issue until May, this year.  She started having weekly episode of bloody diarrer so I took her to the vet and special doctor.  They did all kinds of testing which cost me over $1,500 but didn't figure out the root cause.<br /><br />I searched web sites and found that many dog owners had similliar experiences due to the ingridient change of dog foods.  Therefore, I tried another foods such as Pinnacale (Salmon & Potato) and Avoderm (Chicken and Rice) but it was not successful.  She still had bad bloody diarrer.  I couldn't sleep at night worrying about loosing her.<br />Finally, I found Artemis Fresh Mix without any negative reviews and started feeding it to my dog.  I just switched the food completely not slowly as I knew that all old foods caused the diarrer.<br /><br />When I started feeding Artemis, I found that my dog really liked it.  Previously, she didn't eat the food until she is really hungry.<br />But she ate Artemis right away so I could feed her regularly(twice a day) as it's recommended.<br />In the first week, she had some soft stools but no severe diarrer and bloody stool so I realized this food is right one for my pet.<br />From the second week, she had solid stool and small amount.  Also, she became so energetic like a puppy and so happy.<br />I really appreciate the company make such a food food and hope they never change ingridient.<br />This product saved my lovely friend and family.  I am so happy and recommend it to dog owners strongly!

review/text: After research, I realize Artemis Fresh Mix Small Breed Adult Dog is one of the high-end dog food in the market. My 6 years old pom-a-poo is 13 lbs and doesn't like to eat in general. She has hard time to eat large piece of food, Artemis is perfect for her. When I first fed her with Artemis (1 oz) last night, she was eating it slowly. This morning, I left her 3 oz of Artemis, she seemed happy and enjoying it. I will add 2 tablespoons of water in it going forward. Once a week, I will give her dog can food as a treat.

review/summary: Very pleased
review/text: My Yorkie eats Artemis and only Artemis.  Ended up choosing this brand after reading about it on [&#8230;] and then reading reviews of various dog foods on [&#8230;] Both were very helpful.  This food has quality ingredients (see package) rather than filler.  Small bites:  good for small dogs.  My dog is highly allergic to beef, and has a reaction to many other foods I tried in her first year.  Finally, I realized I should just give her Artemis, which she liked and which I'd read about -- and that she didn't need other stuff mixed in (which inevitably upset her stomach).  My vet suggested I add a dropper-full of Grizzly Salmon Oil once a day (to help with her coat and allergies), so for her breakfast she gets a taste of salmon in her Artemis, plus a couple of tablespoons of water mixed in.  She loves it!  I'm highly satisfied.  I also give her a few bites of this dog food for her treats mid-day and at bed-time.  My understanding is that if you're going to introduce a new dog food into your dog's diet, you should do so gradually, so she'll get used to it (and so will her digestive track).  That's what I did, and it worked.  It's been four years now, and things are going well for her health and her diet.  Highly recommended.

review/text: I bought this as a gift and it was well received.  I had no issues with the packaging and the Chest arrived with no damage.  It is a nice wooden box which could be used to store other little nick nacks when the tea is gone.  Each tea bag is individually sealed.  It is a little pricy if you are just interested in the tea but it does make a nice little gift and I was pleased with it.  Adagio makes some great teas and I regulary buy them myself.<br /><br />The product title is incorrect; it is the 24 tea bag set not the 30 bag gift set which is also available.  I bought it through Amazon because the $26 pricing is better than the Adagio web site (plus free prime shipping). However, I see today that it is only being offered through Adagio for the full price.  This is not such a great deal.  Hopefully Amazon will carry it again in the future.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017OEWR0">Crema de Arroz (Cream Of Rice), 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>I love cream of rice. It is digestible, and easy to prepare. It makes a good breakfast. But it is not always easy to find it in food stores. So I went to Amazon of course. Curiously, if you buy Crema de Arroz rather than Cream of Rice, it is cheaper, so, being in Miami for the winter, I went ahead and ordered it. Tasted just as good in Spanish as it does in English. Muchas gracias.

review/summary: If you can't afford canned Alaskan Sockeye Salmon, then canned Alaskan Pink Salmon has advantages
review/text: The Alaskan pink salmon cannot be more than 3 years old while the Alaskan sockeye salmon can be up to 8 years old.  More Alaskan pink salmon is harvested each year (by weight) than all other Alaskan salmon species put together.  Thus, pink salmon is the smallest, youngest, and most plentiful of the Alaskan salmon.  This means that you will probably save a huge amount of money and also get slightly more delicious salmon skin inside of each can than you would from canned Alaskan sockeye salmon.  True, one can of Alaskan sockeye salmon has more fat than one can of Alaskan pink salmon.  The meat of the Alaskan sockeye is higher in fat and higher in the beneficial carotenoid, astaxanthin, which gives salmon, trout, crabs, lobsters, shrimp, krill, flamingos, and some bacteria their red or pink color.  Yes, the canned sockeye is slightly better than the canned pink but the price is almost twice as high.  Interestingly, Masahide Kaeriyama compared the stomach contents of the Alaskan pink salmon against the stomach contents of the Alaskan sockeye salmon and discovered that:  (1)both species of salmon are eating almost the exact same things when in the ocean, (2)squid is the favorite food of both species of salmon, comprising about one-fourth to one-third of their total diet, (3)red krill (a euphausiid) comprises less than 10% of the total diet of both species of salmon, (4)fishes comprise only about 5% of the total diet of both species of salmon, and (5)copepods, amphipods, decapods, pteropods, octopods, euphausiids, polychaetes, chaetognaths, ostracods, halocypridids, cumacea, gelatinous zooplankton, and barnacles were also found in the stomachs of both the Alaskan pink salmon and the Alaskan sockeye salmon.  Because of different DNA, however, 1 pound of Alaskan sockeye salmon meat has 18.33mg of astaxanthin but 1 pound of Alaskan pink salmon meat has only 2.45mg of astaxanthin.  Average amounts of astaxanthin contained in 1 pound of other salmon species:  2.55mg for Alaskan chum (keta, silverbrite) salmon, 6.26mg for Alaskan coho (silver) salmon, 4.04mg for Alaskan king (chinook) salmon, and 2.40mg for wild Atlantic salmon.  Finally, wild salmon is considered even healthier for us to eat than farmed salmon, partly because wild salmon has better omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratios than farmed salmon.  The average omega-3 to omega-6 ratios are as follows:  farmed Atlantic salmon 2.55 to 1, wild Atlantic salmon 11.72 to 1, canned wild Alaskan sockeye salmon 10.94 to 1, canned wild Alaskan pink salmon 12.74 to 1, wild Alaskan chum salmon 12.31 to 1, wild Alaskan coho salmon 7.15 to 1, and smoked Alaskan king salmon (lox) 1.11 to 1.

review/summary: Dented cans
review/text: Just got my first 12 pack today. The price is fine-- slightly less that what I would pay for canned salmon at my local DG store. I've bought canned goods on Amazon before (beans, cat food, canned pumpkin) and have never had any problem with dented cans. But half the cans in this shipment were dented. Some weren't dented badly and can still be used, but a few are dented in more than one place. I probably won't cancel the subscription just yet, but if the next shipment is half dented like this one, I will cancel. It's not so great a savings as to justify getting dented cans!<br /><br />The product, Chicken of the Sea Salmon, is a fine product, however and my review is for the shipment I received, not the overall product.

review/summary: Information about country of origin
review/text: I set my account up for this item with Amazon.com to ship two cases of pink ALASKAN salmon every month. I received my first two cases and lo and behold, one case says " made in Alaska" and the other case says made in THIALAND. The Alaskan salmon I would buy again and again but unless someone in Amazon.com can guarantee me that the salmon I receive is made and packaged in Alaska, I will definitely cancel my order immediately. I believe firmly in buying American for a number of reasons and none of them are political ( will most of them anyway)l. More of us, I believe, should think this way in order to produce more jobs in our country and not depend on other countries, and whatever their sanitary conditions dictate which could be very much unlike the FDA standards in America. I also believe that Amazon.com should stipulate where each product is made and not the double talk about " packaged in Canada" which could mean purchased in China and then packed in Canada. The only way to improve our country is to rely on Americans to produce products, receive the rewards of their labors and stabilize the economy-now that may be political but it's the damn truth.

review/text: I hope this review helps others save their money or at least have a better idea what to expect and if the product will meet their needs. Traditional style really means fish-in-a-blender--scales, pin-bones, and all. I have a low-salt diet, so salty food tastes really salty to me. However, this is REALLY salty. Almost 1700 mg sodium in the whole can. They could have used half that and been fine. Once you pick out the bones and scales, the meat is appropriately cooked and flaky, even if too salty. A lot of work for a canned product. This may be an appropriate product for under $3 per can, but I felt gypped. If you are being health-conscious, you're probably better off buying a salmon fillet, pulling the pin-bones, and cooking it yourself.

review/text: After paying full local retailer price it was great to find the Sentry Medi-Wraps at such a great price. They arrived promptly and above all the first bag opened was completely fresh.<br /><br />Freshness is important with this product. It should have about the consistency of Playdough perhaps a touch dryer. Sometimes one or a few will be dryer and those just become treats because they won't form around the pill. When they are fresh I can break them in two and use just 1/2 to wrap a pill the size of an aspirin. If you get a bag that is all dried I suggest contacting the place you purchased it for an exchange. Make sure to use the built-in zip lock to keep them fresh after opening.<br /><br />The dog loves them and they have almost no odor so I like them too.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

review/summary: Works great!
review/text: My dog was just diagnosed with Flea Dermatitis. His Vet prescribed him some tablets that help with the itching, and some pills that are antibiotics which make sure no infections start. I went to the nearby Petco because I knew first off it would probably be a challenge to give my dog his medicine since it isn't "treat" flavored like vitamins/other medicine such as Comfortis. I first saw the Greenies brand and was sort of scared of the price. About $12.99 for the 25 count bag that was only good for the tablets and about $9.99 for the 30 count bag good for the pills (I know those were the two prices but I might have switched them around on accident). Well since this is the first time I have ever had to give medicine to my dog, I wanted to look more. I found these which were $8.99 and noticed that it was good for all size medicine. I grabbed these because I didn't have to get two different bags for the two different sizes. Brought it home, and hid the medicine in the "treat" for my dog. It's kind of messy- it will probably crumble a little bit. But it did the job for my dog. I was able to squish it and hide the medicine in the little treat. For the bigger "pill", not the tablet- it was only a TINY bit harder because it was so big and the treat was almost not big enough. But with bit more tweaking of the treat (it's very soft and easy to "transform") I was able to administer it to my dog so he could take. Only once has he been able to "not" take the pill and that was the first time administering. I let him eat it out of my hand and keep holding my hand out below his mouth-works really well, not sure if he knows he can't move it to the ground and chew it up? Not sure. But ANYWAYS, unfortunately I cannot compare it to the name brand Greenies. Not sure if that one crumbles also and not sure if you could just buy one bag and any size medication will fit even if the bag says it only fits a certain kind. But it is definitely working for me and I am satisfied.

review/text: These are my favorite type of Jelly Bellies. I had been eyeing this product for some time. After a few glasses of wine, I decided that this was a must buy because its price per pound was much lower than a single pound of this flavor. The price is still pretty high, but it is about the same price as buying 5 single pounds. I have been snacking on these for a few months. They are still around, and I still love them.<br /><br />The product arrived in a cardboard box with the jelly beans directly in the box. No plastic bag or anything, just the shipping box filled with jelly beans. I am not a huge germaphobe, but would have preferred a better container than the shipping box. This was the only reason why I docked it a star.

review/summary: Great flavor, nice foam
review/text: This was one of my freebies from registering my Tassimo and boy did I choose a good one.  There were a lot of good reviews on this flavor, so I didn't doubt that it was tasty, but after only a week I'm pretty well addicted to the Caramel Macchiato flavor, so I wasn't sure that I'd enjoy a Latte lacking the caramel.  Well, this is wonderful in its own right.  Jacobs espresso is good and smooth, not burnt or harsh tasting.  The creamer is sweet enough with not being sickening and yields a nice foamy top.  I added about a teaspoon of sugar to this, but it is definitely delicious enough without this addition.<br /><br />If you're into aesthetics, use a clear mug for this one because you truly do get the layered effect that is pictured on the package.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering more of this.  I would consider this variety in my top 3 for the Tassimo.  Give it a try, if you haven't yet!  Cheers :)

When visiting, I use the machine also and can see the allure in using one if you can't understand the complexities of a real coffee machine.  The real down side is the cost of using the Tassimo or Keurig for coffee.  Crazy expensive!  But it's better than buying the crap served at $tarbucks, which is burned beyond recognition and then sweetened and flavored to the point where you can't taste the coffee.  Get an espresso there some time with no cream or sugar.  I dare you!

review/summary: Messy, huge servings, more milk than coffee
review/text: This is not a bad beverage but great either, and given how messy it is to make I wish I hadn't bothered with it. The serving size is huge; I used my biggest mug and I still had to stop the machine early to keep it from overflowing. It uses 2 milk cartridges and in between them 1 espresso cartridge. It's hard to taste the coffee at all in the result because there's so little of it compared to the milk. Unsurprisingly the milk tastes like reconstituted powdered milk and the flavor is just a bit off compared to natural milk. So you get a huge serving of milk that doesn't even taste great, with a tiny bit of coffee somewhere in it. I ended up making it with just 1 milk and 1 espresso cartridge and even so it tasted a lot more like milk than coffee.<br /><br />The visual effect of coffee sandwiched between milk looks beautiful on the packaging, but keep in mind that you won't see it unless you actually have transparent mugs or heat-proof glasses.<br /><br />Finally there's just no good way to remove the used milk cartridges from the machine without spilling hot milk on your fingers and making a mess. They're only half empty when they're done and if you don't flip them over extremely fast, you'll get hot milk on your fingertips. I am particularly sensitive to heat so this might not be a problem for others - however the issue about the cartridges dripping over the machine and all the way to the trash can will always be there.<br /><br />The beverage has an interesting flavor and it's a pretty original idea for a coffee machine so I don't regret trying it once, but it's not worth bothering with on a regular basis.

The problem only occurs with the creamer disks, not the coffee disks, and not with any other brand of beverage.  I have checked and cleaned and cleaned to scanner surface, but that is obviously not the problem - the problem is in the bar code on the packaging of the creamer disks.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed. When you consider what these things cost, it's not fun having 75% of them defective.

review/summary: Awesome Sugar Free Cinnamon Altoids (smalls)
review/text: My whole family has tried these.  They like the flavor of these SUGAR FREE cinnamon altoids better than the regular altoid cinnamons.  The flavor in these is more true, you can not tell they are sugar free.  I would highly recommend these to ANYONE! They are great!

review/text: Finally! Have been searching for these small tins of cinnamon Altoids for months - could not find this flavor at drugstores, gas stations or grocery stores. So, I'm very happy that my dear husband thought to look online for me. In my opinion, these are far better than the larger Altoids and I prefer the smaller tins. They fit better into pockets and small handbags.

review/summary: Still cinnamon-y
review/text: These little mints don't let me down. I like them better than the "full-sized" Altoids. A kick of cinnamon - what's not to like?

review/summary: Best mints
review/text: I started with these mints when I quit smoking and the cinnamon flavor was the only thing that helped. They are just strong enough but not over powering.Best little mints on the market, just wish they were still available in the stores

review/summary: Thank you Amazon! Can't find these locally
review/text: I used to be able to find a similar mini cinnamon mint,(store brand), but they were discontinued.  I have never seen these mini Altoids locally, so I ordered this pack of 9 tins.  They taste VERY similar to the ones I used to be able to buy... similar size tin, similar taste.  Thank You Altoids and Amazon!!!  I find that one or two of these mints and a glass of water help keep me from snacking non-stop.... yes, they are tiny, but they have BIG FLAVOR. And the tiny tin makes it easy to carry around.

review/summary: Hot poppin' mints!
review/text: These are hard to find retail in the upper left-hand corner of the U.S. And I like to carry a mix of Peppermint, Wintergreen and Cinnamon mints with me to offer folks a patriotic mix of mints to freshen their breath.

review/summary: all the groceries around here stopped carrying this flavor
review/text: So it's very handy to be able to order it online.<br /><br />These are yummy little mints, sugar-free, and yet full of flavor.<br /><br />I like the wintergreen too, but the cinnamon are my favorite.  They're strong, but not hot.  A whole lot of flavor and breath freshening in a teeny mint.<br /><br />And because they're small, you don't have to monitor intake like with other sugar-free mints, where the sugar alcohols can cause GI side effects if you eat more than 2 or 3.
