review/summary: A Nice Alternative to Spoon Size Shredded Wheat
review/text: One of the things I appreciated about this product is no sorbitol included; all of the sweetness comes from natural sources including brown sugar and sugar. The grains are all whole grain and include a broad spectrum of vitamins. The size of the individual squares is smaller than one typically gets with a shredded wheat product and they maintained their crispiness much longer. The sodium content is reasonably low at 190 mg and the dietary fiber is respectable at 5 grams as is the protein at 6 grams.<br /><br />The taste is pleasant and that, along with the sustained crispiness makes for a nice change from shredded wheat and raisin bran. This one is worth a try.

review/summary: Great cereal but the price?
review/text: I have to give the stuff a good rating because I have liked it enough to say, make it my breakfast for the past 15 years. BUT it has become inordinately expensive here in early 2012.  Recently Quaker reduced the weight from 16 oz. to 14.5 oz. and at the same time the price went from about $3/box to $4.75/box! WTF?!  Sad to say I'm still eating it--it's good.

review/text: Why did it take so long for someone to try making soda out of real juice? It tastes just as good (if not better) than the artificial stuff, and you're not killing yourself by drinking it.<br /><br />I hope this becomes a trend and the big soda companies follow suit so I can start getting this stuff out of vending machines and in larger packs at a lower cost.<br /><br />This particular flavor is a great combination.

review/summary: Deliciousness!
review/text: I buy this at my local WalMart, and decided to post a review simply because I am drinking this right now.<br /><br />Packaging: A thin, tall can. Proportionally splendid. Designed just as posh as the drink itself.<br /><br />Ingredients: 70% Real fruit juice (the only other ingredients are sparkling water, fumaric acid, natural flavors, and vit. C) and 0% artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.<br /><br />Carbonation: Light bubbly sparkliness. Though, since I stick mine in the fridge, it's a WOWing refresher with a sharp kick to the tongue to really wake up your life. Aftertaste does have a slight minerality similar to that of Perrier.<br /><br />Flavors: Primarily blueberry. You will puzzle over the amount of blueberry or pomegranate in each sip at first, especially if you've never had Ocean Spray's blueberry juice (they did not attempt to cheapen the product by drowning out all flavors with cheap grape juice). However, the taste is unmistakably blueberry, with undertones of pomegranate procuring a rather mature flavor.<br /><br />Thirst-Quenching factor: Above average. Compared to a soda out of the fridge, it is excellent. It does fall a little bit short of water, but is on par with Gatorade.<br /><br />This drink is best consumed pinky up, fresh out of a portable champagne compartment in your classy Chevy.

review/summary: Mmm... beer...
review/text: I drank a Duff Energy Drink - yay. Like the Flaming Moe NRG drink, this one apparently came out awhile ago. Here's another review - hurray.<br /><br />Taste: 4.5/5 Quite good. Not as good as the Flaming Moe NRG drink, but still good. It tastes a lot like orange pop/soda, really. One of the better NRG drinks I've had behind Flaming Moe NRG drink. If you ask me though, for whatever reason, Duff goes down easier/you can drink more faster.<br /><br />Smell: 4/5 This has a very faint orange-like smell. There's not much to it, smells like orange pop/soda, but just a little different. Not a strong odor, but it smells nice.<br /><br />Look: 5/5 The can, while bland, looks exactly like the one from the show. It has the exact same design, beside the fact it says Energy Drink below Duff. Still, like I said, looks like the one from the show.<br /><br />Overall: 4.5/5 Duff NRG Drink shouldn't disappoint. Many picky people may find the taste pretty disgusting ( it, in a way, has a slightly bitter taste, I guess. ) but I really liked it. Most people won't even drink this ( or the Flaming Moe one ) and will just keep it as a collectable. If you ask me, you should buy two of each can so you can drink one of each.<br /><br />4.5/5<br /><br />Notable Nutrition Facts: 12 Oz.

review/summary: FOX merchandise with an animated buzz...I mean caffeinated kick
review/text: With a rampant craze that spread faster and wider than the freaking cancer, energy drinks have become a common staple of the American caffeine junkie, instantly, from one day to the next. Strolling through obtuse grocery aisles my eyes are hardly at rest. Everyone has an energy drink brand: Monster, Rockstar, Elmo, Barbie, even that guy that guy Richard Grieco who used to come out on that show 21 Jump Street. Well not really, but there are plenty. And with so much variety, how could my daily caffeine intake get any better? Only when The Simpsons entered the market with DUFF.<br /><br />  A delicious orangey taste that mockingly counters the color palette of beer, the low stamina days become high stamina days and the Simpson's brand logo puts a blissfully dorky smile on my face.  The bubbly tonic is rightfully simple in taste, without the excessive extravagance of other energy drinks that make your teeth wonder when they might get brittle and break like the stumpy columns of ancient Greece (i.e. Arizona green tea energy drink).  Don't let a cartoon brand Energy Drink parody of beer fool you either. This liquid delivers with a steady caffeine peak, without a draining crash. It is a drink that delivers in the substance of product and exceedingly well in the d&eacute;cor of its package. Ay Caramba!

review/summary: Must buy for any true Simpsons fan.
review/text: As a fan of the Simpsons, I knew I had to have this as soon as I saw it.  I ordered 3 of them and they actually got here one day ahead of schedule!  The cans look awesome, the color and design are perfect.  The only thing that I would have changed is the "energy drink" text under the Duff logo, I think it would look better without it.  The cans had minor dents and scuffs, but not a deal-breaker.  Each can had barcodes stickers stuck on the can that seemed to be placed in a way to cover some of these scuffs up.  Maybe they were on display in a store or something?...but like I said; not a deal-breaker for me.  The drink tastes pretty good too, it's a sour-orangey-energy drink flavor.  I usually drink Amps and I like these, it has more of a bite to it but it's OK.  P.S.  Toss them in the fridge for a while after they are delivered!  Like most drinks they are much better cold.

review/summary: As expected...don't drink it!!
review/text: I got it just for the novelty...then one night, I was doing some studying and was tired. I pounded down and energy drink and kept plugging away. Again I started to get tired, slammed down another can of diabetes and continued my studies. As the night turned to morning I opened the fridge for another energy drink...nothing. So i went back to my research, then as my eyes were growing heavy, I spotted this sucker up on my desk, curse my eyes, next thing you know I was guzzling down this sludge. It tasted like dirty mop water, and gave me a headache, then I fell asleep and missed class, surprised I didn't wake up in an alley with torn clothes in a pool of my own bile...Anyway, I bought this for the novelty, and am rating it for the novelty. 5 Stars!!!

review/text: I bought this item at the local grocery store for $5.50 for a 9.8 oz jar which would be $16.50 for 3. I absolutely love this sweetener so I checked to see if Amazon offered it. At my surprise:<br /><br />Amazon wants nearly double that for the same amount PLUS over $10.00 in shipping for these 3 small jars!!! I am very disapointed in Amazon for this irresponsible price/shipping for this item and will not purchase this from them until they get their heads out of the clouds and offers this item for a competitive price and free shipping. If they would do this, I would do the subscribe and save option as I use this item every day. I would have given this item 5 stars if it wasn't for Amazon's price/shipping.

review/summary: The best available stevia product
review/text: I have been using stevia products since at least 2008, originally as Stevita, a product that has the consistency and spoonability of sugar.<br />Like Stevita, Truvia has the consistency and spoonability of sugar. Like Stevita, Truvia has no calories. It is an effective sweetener, and in the spoonable version I'm reviewing is quite easy to use in many ways. The envelopes of Truvia are handy to carry with, but ripping them open spills a little bit on the counter, when using a small spoon with the jar version might well be neater.<br />UNLIKE Stevita Truvia is widely marketed, except that it's not in a Target store in the Chicago suburbs. It is even available in my local fairly small supermarket in West Philadelphia/University City. At one time the supermarket carried the jars, but then there was price drop on the envelopes and that is now all they carry.<br />I agree with another reviewer that Amazon is taking a cue from one of its sellers, and is charging an outrageous price for 3 jars of Truvia. A little goes a long way; I am really not sure I want to spend twice the price of 3 jars in the store, to buy 3 jars from Amazon. Would I even use up enough in a year to justify the purchase?<br /><br />It's a good product. Keep looking until you find it at a semi-reasonable price. It does cost more than sugar. On the other hand, the benefits of no sugar high, and reduced calories, make it worthwhile.

review/text: This has been our complete replacement for sugar for several years now.  It's good stuff, but Target and Walmart and most decent size grocery stores carry these for about $6 per 9.8 oz jar (just go the section of the store where the regular sugar is).  The price here is over $12 per 9.8 oz jar--there is no way you should buy it from here unless you're sure you can't get it in your regular grocery outlets.

These are definitely a winner, they are crunchy and satisfying but not too salty.  They avoid the problem some whole grain snacks have of being heavy and too chewy. I fed them to my four year old and my husband and everyone agreed- definitely something we will be purchasing in the future.

They are sturdy and crunchy, but not so much that they are a chore to chew.  They are labelled as Sea Salt flavor, which sounds a little dull, but they are actually bursting with flavor.  They are fairly low in calories; each serving has 120 of them.  A serving size is approximately 11 crisps and contains: 180mg of sodium, 22g carbs (5g fiber and 2g sugars), 3g of protein and 10 grams of whole grain!  All in all, a pretty nutritious snack that definitely doesn't lack in flavor.

They hold up well when they are dipped and have just enough of a salty flavor to fix any salt craving. I'd definitely recommend these in place of your standard golden crackers/saltines given the more solid nutrition of kashi items! Also,something to note, if you are buying kashi items in bulk be prepared to eat a lot of them and quickly as the expiration dates are usually no more than 2 or 3 months past purchse (afterall these don't have all the chemicals/preservatives of your typical quick foods)

They are a bit pricey but the quality if worth the price.<br /><br />The pita chips have a delicate whole grain flavor that is very satisfying.<br /><br />I especially like that the chips are whole rather than cracked into small pieces.<br /><br />There are 11 very crispy servings per box with 120 cal per serving, 3 g fat, 180 mg sodium, 22 g carbs, 5 g fiber, 2 g sugar, and 3 g protein.<br /><br />The chips are made from whole grain oats, rye, brown rice, barley, buckweat, sesame seeds, yellow corn meal, millet, cane juice, and sea salt.<br /><br />They are made by Kashi, La Jolla, CA--made in the USA.<br /><br />These pita chips make me want to give other Kashi product a second chance.<br /><br />I am definitely going to try their other pita chip flavors zesty salsa!

review/summary: What a disappointment!
review/text: Better known brands of limburger spread disappeared from the market several years ago. I hoped this Amish Country product would fill the void. But what a disappointment! This spread is essentially a combination of limburger with an assertive and not very compatible white cheddar. This two-cheese combination could be acceptable to some tastes. But the blend also contains acetic acid and its patently distinctive smell, sharp taste and sting. For my taste, the three together produce a spread with a flavor quite alien to limburger cheese per se, though a trace of its aroma is still there. Because it is not truly unpalatable, I might suggest it to the adventurous snacker. I will not buy it again myself.

review/summary: A little spicy for many kids, but delicious!
review/text: These crackers/pita crisps are really good. They taste a little spicy, and almost a little cheesy, but in a really good, non-artificial way. And there is no trans fat and a healthy dose of whole grains in these. We like them with hummus or cream cheese, or just plain. Well, most of my kids don't really like them (they think they're too spicy), but that leaves more for my husband, my 9 month old baby (!), and me!<br /><br />Note that Amazon's price (currently about $3/box) is decent, but you can get a better price on individual boxes with sales and coupons at most grocery stores (closer to $1.75-$2/box). It depends on what you want more: money or lots of crackers with home delivery. ;)<br /><br />Recommended!

review/summary: My new morning and evening hot drink
review/text: I recently purchased Cafix at my local natural food store and I love it.  I must say that I was a little hesitant about buying a whole can without having tried it (or even heard of at the time).  This is the only coffee-substitute that I've tried, but I'll probably stick with it.  When I first tried it, I think my tongue was expecting coffee and my body was expecting caffeine, so the taste was different and unexpected... but in a good way.  It's a great hot drink (especially post-dinner) and I don't think it's an acquired taste as long as you don't expect coffee and just treat it as its own category of drink.  My conclusion:  whether you're trying to kick the caffeine habit or just trying to find a healthy-natural alternative, give it a shot.<br />  I'm not much of a milk or sugar person, so I usually enjoy it with vanilla almond drink as a creamer or following the latte direction on the can.  The manufacturer's web site also has an iced Cafix recipe that I've yet to try.

review/text: Cafix IS the coffee substitute that tastes most like coffee, and this pack of 6 from Amazon is the best deal you'll find. But, I first bought Cafix packaged in a glass jar and having a granular consistency. LOVED it! This Cafix is packaged in canisters and is a powder. It tastes different. Not bad. Just different. To me it has a very nutty taste. I like the glass jar Cafix better, but I can also drink the canister kind. Some people, however, might not like the nuttier taste. Just FYI.

The ingredients on the label of the Amazon listed product (powdered) are slightly different and the flavor is slightly less coffee-like, but still a better flavor choice than  Postum (discontinued).<br /><br />Also the "Crystal" product dissolves a little easier (looks like freeze-dried instant coffee) and does not lump up if the water is too hot as does the powdered product.

review/text: I love coffee--not so much for the caffeine, but simply for the taste...or maybe it's just a habit that I can't break.  Every so often I decide that I'm going to "kick the habit" and I try to switch to green tea or some other tea that is naturally caffeine-free.  It never works, though.  I found Cafix in a health food store some years ago and I really liked it. It did the trick for me--a little soy milk and I was good to go.  However, when I ran out of it, I started drinking coffee again because the local retailer stopped carrying Cafix.  I just found Cafix here on Amazon and I'm going to order some since I'm back on my "giving up coffee" rant.  As long as I am, I know I can rely on Cafix for that coffee fix to which I am so accustomed.

review/summary: Pero, Inka, Cafix review...
review/text: I bought a case of all three products, Inka, Pero and Cafix in order to compare them. Honestly? They are all the same, so go with whatever is the cheapest. I think I did like Cafix the best, but it may be a mental thing with the name at least sounding somewhat like Coffee. There is little difference in all three, they look identical with only tiny coloration differences. All by themselves they do not taste like coffee and if you are a black coffee drinker? Pass, because you will not be satisfied with the taste. It is very bland all by itself. BUT, if you like cream in your coffee? You won't even notice the difference between coffee and these products within a week or two you will forget you are not drinking coffee. I am PERFECTLY happy with all three products and will continue to drink them;I will choose by PRICE due to the very similar make of them all. The cans all read the same ingredient wise.

review/text: Hi there, prior to Cafix, we were drinking Dandy Blend, but I wanted to try something different; works out that Cafix is a tad cheaper in the long run, and it does the job.  Didn't want acidic coffee (in fact, been drinking the Dandy Blend for over a year now - hence wanting to try something new).  Wasn't disappointed!  It dissolves well -- I'm probably the only person on the planet who does this:  put a little water in your coffee maker carafe, add 5 rounded spoons (or more to your taste).  Then add just the plain water to the coffee pot (don't overfill!!! as you have some in your pot with the dissolved coffee!!) and then we auto brew it. Obviously there's no need for a coffee filter, so we save on that too. This way, we can "think" we're having real coffee from the pot!!  Oh, regarding taste: it tastes just like Dandy Blend so I wasn't disappointed - like my title says: Great coffee substitute!

review/text: Rather than my usual morning cup of coffee, I was looking for something that would satisfy my taste for coffee and this product does that nicely! A hot cup of Cafix tastes good, and has the additional benefit of not leaving me with a desire for 'another cup'. One is sufficient to satisfy my desire for the hot cup of coffee, and (as it turns out) one a day is plenty for me. I enjoy Cafix, and no longer drink either tea or coffee. This is a great replacement drink, since it does taste good all on its own - I never think about coffee any more. Plus - big bonus - the price for the quantity gives a cost savings over in-store purchases!

review/summary: NOT COFFEE...
review/text: Despite claims that CAFIX is a "coffee substitute," suffice it to say, that it does NOT, in any way, taste like coffee, at least to me. If you remember a product from the past called POSTUM, CAFIX tastes exactly like this. Whether or not it has a good taste is very subjective. I recently bought the CAFIX because I am trying to stop drinking coffee, but honestly, there is no comparison between the two. Many may love CAFIX right from the start, some may dislike it, some may absolutely hate it. One thing is for sure: CAFIX is a healthier alternative to coffee and if you do not like the taste and can figure out some sweeteners to make it palatable, then by all means, go for it. This is precisely what I am doing. I do not particularly care for the taste of CAFIX, but am going to try to let it grow on me over time, because coffee makes me too hyper, and is generally not a healthful beverage, although obviously it quite the favorite among millions of people. I certainly want to LOVE Cafix, but only time will tell.

review/text: After a few years of not drinking any coffee, including the so-called "decaf" varieties, finding Cafix was a real joy. The taste is at least as good as Folgers instant. I started avoiding caffeine about 15 years ago when I found I had difficulty sleeping if I drank it after 3PM. Over the next several years I switched to decaf entirely and found I even had to avoid it after noon. Another health concern, atrial fibrillation, resulted in my avoidance of all stimulants. So I stopped drinking even the decaf varieties all together. I have a near-boiling water dispenser that I use with Cafix to "brew" my new pseudo coffee. And now I can even have a cup in the evening with desert, which is a wonderful taste combination that I've missed. This is an excellent product for anyone avoiding caffeine.

When I called their customer service department, they refused to send the package via USPS which could ship for FAR less than $26!!!<br /><br />I am getting fed up with the suppliers Amazon chooses to deal with when it comes to shipping to Hawaii! Wrong shipping quotes and rude customer service- I was even told I lived in a 'foreign' zone once and that the supplier refused to ship to me! How can Amazon allow their suppliers to refuse to ship to a US address??<br /><br />I have chosen to buy my Cafix at  [...]<br /> where they offer reasonable shipping choices such as USPS parcel post. I can get 12 of these tins sent to me via  [...]<br /> for only $18.95!<br /><br />Forget DAB Nutrition (Direct Super Center) and their rude policies and get your fantastic coffee alternative from an online supplier who cares:  [...]<br /><br />signed, "Frustrated in Maui"

review/summary: The best dark chocolate!
review/text: I am a huge chocolate lover and have sampled every brand in my search for the best dark chocolate.  Equal Exchange is the best! The texture and taste are superior to other chocolates. My other favorite dark chocolates are Icelandic chocolate 70% (available at Whole Foods), Lindt Bittersweet (the large thick bar). Dove dark chocolate is also a favorite, but it's only 50 - 60% dark and is a little sweeter, but still great.

review/summary: I really enjoy loose leaf tea
review/text: I have used tea bags for years and years...they are clean and easy to use.  My boss introduced me to loose leaf tea and I think the difference in taste is worth the extra work.  The Tao of Tea brand is unique from it's packaging (I love the tins and reuse them after I am done with the tea) to the mixture of the flavors.  I am currently enjoying their Moroccan Mint blend, and find it really light and extremely enjoyable.  Another good thing about loose leaf tea...is you can make it as strong or as weak as you like...very "tunable" to the individual taste.  I can't recommend a product higher than this product.

review/summary: A Very Pleasant Tea
review/text: I just finished a tin of this.  It was very good.  You get these dry flaky mint leaves mixed in with this round ball style green tea.  There's more mint leaf than green tea in the ratio it seems, although the green is more compact so who knows..  It's a nice mix - a bit stronger than plain mint tea, but lighter than a straight green/jasmine tea. Mint is the overriding flavor; the green somehow gives it a stronger body. I'm buying one as a gift this time.

review/text: I havent tried many mint teas but I have tried more than 30 different green teas from different brands and I can say this is pretty good. The mint flavors and green tea flavors actually are pretty balanced but with a slight lean towards the mint. Ive found that I can get at least 4-5 steepings out of 3 tablespoons making 13ozs for each steep. Oddly enough for me the second and third steeps are the best. If you want to try a mint tea I say go with this one, I dont think you can go wrong.

review/summary: Mostly green tea in my view
review/text: I've had a few cups.  I have to admit that I overlooked the fact that was is a blend of green tea with mint when I got it.  I did not enjoy as much as I had hoped.  For one, this is mostly green tea on examination and on taste.  It has as much caffeine as some green teas - so keep that in mind.  I think the true ratio is about 80% green and 20% mint.  By the way, the product description is incorrect in stating that this is a blend of black tea and mint.  I won't be getting it again, the green tea contained in this blend is a bit overpowering, in my opinion.

review/text: When I thought about buying these seeds there was only one other review. It was a good review so I decided to take a chance and buy the seeds. I am so glad I did. First of all they gave me a bonus package of seeds! And not one of the herbs that was already included in the set. The individual seed packets look exactly like the picture. They all have directions for planting the seeds, watering and sunlight exposure. All of my seeds have sprouted. There were no dead seeds. They certainly delivered the goods! and now it is all up to me. I would highly recommend Seed Needs for their herb seed packets. Great stuff!

review/text: Last year was the first year I had time enough to plant a garden, and these seeds looked like a great place to start.  I lost a bunch of seedlings when I had to move (they died of shock, I think), but when I replanted the second batch came up quickly and did really well, except for the cilantro (which never sprouted to begin with).  The parsley and mustard were particularly robust, and threatened to overtake the whole garden plot as Fall came on.  My housemates and I have been feasting on home-grown basil, oregano, and dill all winter.  I definitely recommend this seed set--it is great value for money!

But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.<br /><br />Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.<br /><br />Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.<br /><br />Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Mir

Not with Plocky's...I always eat less and feel satisfied.  I actually prefer these eaten by themselves..no dips...and I keep a bag in my desk at work.  I have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something.  I bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too.  I am a fan of Plocky's chips and will continue to purchase them on Amazon.

There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips. However, some of the spices are lacking from this chip. But I liked this very much.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips. Go ahead-- you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese.

review/text: We love these. Can't always get them in local stores, they don't keep them stocked even though we are always buying them out. Strong enough to dip in any condiment, great flavor and grain texture.

review/summary: Tasty, but make sure you have gum
review/text: These spicy chips have a lot of great flavor but be warned, you will be left with some stanky breath afterwards! The first time I ate these was at night and then even after brushing and flossing I could taste them in my mouth the next morning. So just be careful about when you eat them, especially if you will be hanging out with people later in the day.

review/summary: Don't stop carrying these chips
review/text: The first time I ate these chips was in Aruba in 2007.  I couldn't find them in our area (CT) so you can imagine my joy when I found them on Amazon.  I love these and hope you continue to carry them.  Your prices are terrific too.  I pay $2.99 in Aruba and they run about $2.46 a bag when I buy the case of 12 through Amazon.  Good job!!!!  Only problem is, now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in, but that's ok...sharing is good.

review/text: These chips are delicious. If you like salt & pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch, then you can't go wrong with these--they are the tastiest bag I've come across. The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt, in fact I have trouble cutting myself off mid-bag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet. I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8-9oz bags.
