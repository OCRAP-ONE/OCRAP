review/summary: Forget about finding in a gourmet store...find it here!
review/text: We visited the south of France during the summer.  Spent time with our friends who live there.  They made us the most delicious dinner one evening.  Using these bricks...they rolled a ball of mozzarella in thyme, and then rolled a thin slice of prosciutto around the mozzarella ball/thyme.  Then rolled it up in a brick and baked them for about 15 minutes.  I was obsessed with finding these bricks.  I went to gourmet store after gourmet store here to no avail.  Finally, on Amazon, I found them!  Whew.  I didn't want to have to travel all the way back to France to get them!

review/summary: Fine Product
review/text: I have purchase this product on 3 different occasions to re-create a French cooking class we attended while in Paris a few years ago. The product has always arrived in top shape, carefully packaged and kept cold with a cold pack. We have found that the shipper has taken care to roll the package rather than fold it which could lead to breakage of the very thin product. We have always been most pleased with the performance of the product and our dining/cooking companions had no difficulty utilizing the dough in spite of it being their first introduction to its use. We would have been at a loss to create one of the class' signature dishes without it. It has always worked well for us.

review/summary: Great cat food
review/text: This product(Wellness Core) in an outstanding cat food.  We have a Persian kitten who had issues with vomiting which was really hard on us. Poor little guy was sick from the time we brought him home.  He then developed a virus he caught from feral cats hanging around our lanai.  Yes the bacteria is in the air.  Vet put him on steroids, anti-biotics, IV.  He recovered and now we<br />feed him only Wellness Core (Beef, Venison and Lamb).  He never vomits and this stuff even looks great when you open the can.  No grains, no fillers.  It is a little expensive but well worth every penny.  To see this beautiful cat now gaining weight and so active does our heart good and our floors as well.  He loves the stuff.

review/summary: Fruit-flavored perfection ...
review/text: This is "very good" quality candy with an elongated shape that comes in an assortment of fruit flavors (strawberry, pineapple, lemon, orange, etc.), each with its own distinctive and tasty chewy fruit filling.<br /><br />It is candy in the "Viennese" tradition of making this kind of candy - not quite the "real thing" as it is made in Austria, but it's close and all but impossible to find locally.<br /><br />This same seller (Great Ones For You) has another comparable candy - round in shape and somewhat larger - available here on Amazon: "Arcor Assorted Fruit Flavored Kosher Candy with Chewy Centers 2 Packs".<br /><br />I have also tried this other candy and can recommend it highly; it is actually the one of the two that I personally prefer.<br /><br />Buy some, taste and enjoy. The two bags provided probably won't last long, so be sure to purchase enough to keep your sweet tooth happy.

review/text: Let me start by saying that if your dog(s) are very small or small breed, this is a great size kibble.  Having said that, my dogs were just okay with it.  I had to mix something in to get them to eat it.  Their stools seemed fine, but my schnauzer seemed more itchy.  I have gone to Hi-Tek lamb meal and sweet potato instead.  The number one ingredient in this product is just potato, not meat.  I'd rather spend a little more for better quality.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00609PJTC">Hi-Tek Naturals Grain Free Lamb Meal and Sweet Potato Formula Dry Dog Food, 15 Pounds</a>

review/summary: Great shells, decent snails
review/text: Got this as a gift (I asked for new shells) and was very happy with these.  The shells are giant, love that.  They are also good quality.  I've tried cheaper shells from amazon that crack and split.  These have held up well.  Pain to wash (soak with water, dry in oven at low temp) but all shells are.  I thought the snails were just fine, however I've never tasted different qualities within a short enough period of time to tell the difference.  The size of the snails were large as well.<br /><br />I think these make a great gift since its a all in 1 make some escargot set. Heck buy the set of 2 and keep 1 for yourself!. Can use this without a shell pan if you don't have one (though the pan makes it easier and catches all that delish sauce).<br /><br />It is always good with the typical butter/herb recipe but I also enjoy this one:<br /><br />Escargot in Wine Recipe:<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />* 1 can (4 oz. size) escargot, drained<br />* 1/4 cup red wine<br />* 1 clove garlic, crushed<br />* 1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper<br />* 1/2 cup butter<br />* 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped<br />* 1 teaspoon tarragon<br />* 2 tablespoons chives<br /><br />Directions:<br />1. Marinate escargot in wine and seasonings - at least 2-3 hours. Place escargot in shells. Spoon in wine mixture. Marinate.<br /><br />2. Press 1 teaspoon butter (softened) over opening of shell. (This seals in the escargot.)<br /><br />3. Place in baking pan. Bake in 425 degree oven for 10-15 minutes until bubbly.

review/text: $20 for 2 dozen escargot is a really great deal considering its at least $9 for 6 in a restaurant. These were really good, large snails and comes with pretty shells too.<br /><br />I didnt want to cook them in shells since its a pain to clean, and my friend wants to keep them for decoration. A mini muffin pan works perfectly if you don't have an escargot dish or you can just bake it in a small Pyrex. I do frozen squeezed spinach on the bottom, add snail w salted butter, garlic and shallots, top w Parmesan and/or mozzarella - serve w garlic bread

review/text: I have purchased the Roland snails in the past and have been more than satisfied.  However I usually bought the cans only and used my own shells.  Often the snails and my shells were not a fit and I would have to jam large snails into the shells, which didn't work out for either.  The Roland combination of giant snails and shells were a delight.  Oh, by the way, they tasted GREAT as well!

I went online to check the reviews of this and the Mexican community raves about it--so I figured that is good enough for me! Plus, the Mexican grocers charge on average of $3.50 per box, whereas there are 9 boxes in this lot for less than $15!!!  We will be enjoying this many times and will reorder when we run out. Great on chicken, pork, shrimp...you name it. Has a hint of chocolate taste to it, and although I know it sounds crazy, it reminds me a tiny bit of Cincinnati chili--that cinnamon/cardamom/unsweetened chocolate flavor with spices. TOOOO GOOOOD for words.

review/text: I bought several single boxes of Tulsi Tea in several flavors and the original one is my very favorite one. The other flavors (vanilla, ginger and lemon) are just ok to me. For an unflavored herbal type tea, Original tastes very good. My only regret is that I only bought 1 box. I drank 3 cups a day until it was gone and although I still have the other flavors, I miss the original! I will be buying the Original by the case from now on. I found that with the other flavors, I have to add honey to be able to drink it but with the original I love it just as it is.

A friend had several cannisters of instant Cappuccino (French Vanilla).  I served it up (still am) and it is a huge success.  If it doesn't taste just right, just add a little more powder and you are good to go.  Put a couple of marshmallows in it (in Mexico, called Bon Bon's) and we have made a few hundred people asking where we got such a tasty drink!!!  I'm hooked and will purchase lots next time I am in the states!!!  Will look for other flavors as well.  I also add a pkg. of instant chocolate milk to around 18 cups for an even better taste.  Wonderful and reasonably priced product!!!  Linda/Loreto, Baja Mexico

review/summary: Beware - dusty and stale
review/text: I recently ordered these and was extremely disappointed.  Here were the problems:<br /><br />1) OLD!!  They actually tasted dusty and I could feel no potency in them at all.<br />2) Wolfberries not Goji Berries.  Since I've consumed Goji's from many sources over the years, I know which are the highest quality Goji's (usually quite expensive), which are less potent, and which are the different tasting Wolfberry variety that many sellers pass off as Goji's but are not the same.  Wolfberry has its own benefits (not nearly those of Goji IMO), but for Wolfberries these are widly overpriced.  You can get the same in Chinese stores for probably closer to $10 for twice the amount.<br /><br />With the dollar devaluation top quality Goji berries have gotten very expensive for regular use.  So if you're looking for cheaper alternatives like I was here, look elsewhere.  Check out some of the cheap goji berries (that are in fact wolfberries and usually say so) on Ebay from Chinese sources.  They'll be quite a bit cheaper and likely quite a bit fresher.

review/text: I was impressed by the price, so I ordered these.  They are horrible...hard as rocks, stale-tasting, full of stems, and they leave a bad after taste in the mouth.  I am a raw vegan and use lots of goji berries; I have never experienced any as awful as these.<br /><br />Perhaps this is only a bad batch, as others seem to have gotten good ones.  If that's the case, then the company has terrible qualitycontrol, as well as terrible goji berries.

review/summary: Good value, a bit dry
review/text: These berries are a bit drier and chewier (and less sweet) than I expected. However, I found that if I add a hand full of them to a bag of sweetened dried cranberries, it makes it much less noticeable.

review/summary: I've tried many bags of Goji Berries, these are the worst...
review/text: I've tried many bags of Goji Berries from different companies.  Some are good and some are not so good.  I later found out that the Goji Berries from China are not the best quality.  So, I found a brand that said that they are the "authentic Tibetan Goji Berries" at my local health food Co-Op.  Although they were expensive, they were good.  I later bought another brand at the 2007 Raw Spirit Festival in Sedona, AZ.  They were the best that I ever had, soft and delicious.<br /><br />When I saw that there were some inexpensive authentic organic Tibetan Goji Berries on Amazon, I became excited.  I made the purchase and couldn't wait to get them.  When I received them and tried them I was very disappointed.  They are the hardest, driest, discolored, worst tasting Goji Berries that I ever had.  I immediately felt that I was sold and inferior product in a nice bag.  These Goji Berries have a bad taste and have sediment on them as if they were not clean.  I called the company to inquire about the origin.  Of course they did say that they are authentic Tibetan Goji Berries.  I just don't believe them.  There were two bags that came with my order.  The second bag remains unopened and will probably eventually get tossed.

review/text: Not only was this brand of Goji berries the most economical I found on Amazon, but their taste meets or exceeds the other two brands I have tried.<br /><br />I throw a handful of these into my cereal, mix them in with salad, or eat them out of the bag. Also good cooked in with pasta or meat. They are not very sweet, but have a unique flavor and a consistency that makes you want to chew.

review/text: Very impressed with company and am hoping to reap the benefits of these little berries.  If you wonder what it tastes like, I would say that a raisin is the closest comparison, but gojis seem to leave an aftertaste that is a little gritty.  If you can put up with it, it is a great way to curb cravings for something sweet and an awesome way to get antioxidents.

They're so dried that they seem "lifeless" as in the majority of goji benefits have been sucked out.  I won't be buying these again unless I see improvement from eating the rest of these hard goji berries.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: The most I can say about this product is that it has an interesting label. I had a palm full which left a terrible bitter taste in my mouth for six hours until dinner when it started to go away. I didn't feel so good either. The pieces were very stuck together and some appeared to have very tiny pieces of leaf attached to them. I have purchased several other brands from local natural food stores with no problem whatsoever, so I figured that all would be well to order something unknown online. I also didn't want to run out of goji berries and have to pay for shipping very soon, so I ordered to two sets which totals four bags. I finished my supply from the natural food store today, and I started on the Extreme Health which is one day beyond the Amazon.com return policy. Therefore I'll have to throw in the trash about $60. LESSON: Never order any food that you're not sure about even if it has a pretty label and/or try it out before one month or you can't return it to Amazon.com.

review/summary: Excellent quality after 4 bags and counting
review/text: I have had several bags of these and re-ordered them more than once. They are a good quality product. They have a wee bit more extra tid bits of leaves or the odd twig compared to the Navitas Naturals dried goji berries. The Navitas Naturals are slightly larger and more uniform and a bit paler (not much, but a little) in color and don't have any extra stuff in them. There isn't enough of anything to worry about in these, but if you compare them side by side, it is obviousl which is which. I am following the diabeticlifediet.com salad meal and always have a handful (maybe 20-30g) of these in every salad along with the Dragon Fruit (which I wish Amazon would carry). Their flavor is a little different from the Navitas Naturals, but it is apples an oranges and both are good. I alternate just for variety, but I give both 5 stars. The texture is good and I have never had any problem with quality. They are always separate (some people complain they are in lumps stuck together). I have had every bag in good condition and other than a few odd berries with some mold on them (again, a wee bit more often than than Navitas), I have never had a problem. I only hope these are farmed sustainably and harvested in a way that respects the plants.

After opening them, I still wasn't sure, so I rinsed off a small amount and let them dry.  They tasted pretty good but I don't know if they are the good ones or the not so good ones.  I enjoy them and these seem satisfactory.  I don't know if these are the super duper, high in anti-oxidants, or not.  I don't really care but, I would expect for the price, they should be.  Like I said, I know nothing about health or healthy food choices, I simply like the chewiness and the slight tart taste.  I still wonder if they were cleaned before packaging.  I sure wish I knew.

review/summary: Absolutely loaded with trans-fat
review/text: As of Nov 2007, each 16 gram serving contains 2 grams of trans fat!  That is 1/8th trans-fat by weight, and more than 1/8 by calories!!!  (Please consult the packaging for more current information, many manufacturors are removing trans-fat. Beware: they may legally claim 0 grams of trans fat when they have half a gram PER SERVING, which is very significant for small serving sizes.  So you should look for the words "partially hydroginated" in the ingredient list.  If you see "partially hydrogenated" then you know the product has artificial trans fat and you should NOT buy it.)<br /><br />Don't take my word for it that this is bad, because here are some quotations from the survey article<br /><br />Mozaffarian et al "Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,"<br />The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354,<br />pages 1601-1613 (2006).<br /><br />Here are a few quotations from this article:<br /><br />"given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD ["coronary heart disease"] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. "heart attacks"] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted."<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />"The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed."<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />"On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm."<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook "nutritional epidemiology", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book "Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."

review/summary: It's not gourmet, but it's tasty and easy for weekday nights!
review/text: Having been gluten free for most of my life, I was really excited when I found Mrs. Leeper's packaged meals. I never imagined that I would ever be able to have the gluten free equivalent of "tuna helper" or "hamburger helper." When I tried this boxed meal, I knew I had found a winner, and my (non GF) husband agreed. The corn noodles are very tasty and we both enjoy them equally- and the creamy, cheesy sauce is simple but goes very nicely with the tuna. I usually add some kind of fresh or defrosted vegetable- peas, green beans, etc. to the dish while it is simmering and then serve it with freshly chopped tomatoes and red or orange diced peppers on top. I doctor mine up with some freshly ground pepper and vietnamese hot sauce, but my husband likes it plain. Very, very good. My husband likes to make this when it is his night to cook, and I'm all too happy to let him. It may not be the most gourmet food product, but it's not horrible for you if you use lowfat milk, and it really is tasty for such a quick, easy GF meal.<br /><br />-happy GF pasta chomper<br /><br />PS I do have to say that this is my favorite of the Mrs. Leepers meals, perhaps because we don't eat meat or chicken. However, I do think the corn pasta and cheesy sauce is a real winner and superior to the other sauces and pastas. (For example, her chicken alfredo box meal is based on a rice pasta... it's ok, but seems a little lacking...)

review/summary: Quick, delicious & easy go to meal...
review/text: One of the best semi-prepared gluten free products in the market. You only need to add some milk, butter and tuna - though I add some frozen peas at the end as well. I can whip up this creamy and satisfying meal in a skillet in less than 30 minutes. The noodles cook up with a nice firm texture and the sauce is very flavorful...except for some fresh ground black pepper and a bit of salt it doesn't need to be "doctored" at all. Any leftovers reheat perfectly in the microwave (just add a teaspoon or so of water first). My non restricted husband loves this too. Amazon's subscribe & save program makes this boxed meal very affordable.

review/summary: Tuna Helper for the gluten free rest of us
review/text: I missed easy to prepare meals when I had to stop eating gluten, so I was really glad to find this and discover that it is as yummy as it's tuna helper counterpart ever was.  Nothing to be missed, in fact might even taste better.  Easy to prepare, I think adding 2 cans of tuna or 1 larger one makes it better though.  The price is a little steep in the stores for 1 box though.

review/text: I was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease.  I lived off of Pasta and Bread.  I used to make a homemade Tuna Casserole --- this is just as good if not better.  If I didn't tell you that it was corn pasta you would never know!!!!!  The sauce is creamy and delicious!!!!  If you are going through flour withdrawals like me, this will help make the transition easier.  Oh and it is so easy to make, my 12 year old can do it.

review/text: This is a very tasty and convenient gluten free "Hamburger Helper" type of thing for people on a gluten free diet.  My creative hubby used canned chicken instead of tuna and chicken broth instead of water and made a chicken dumpling style dish instead - also very good.  (Yes, they make a chicken version but sometimes you make what you see when you walk into the pantry)<br /><br />Add a cup of frozen peas and carrots or other veggie and you've got a good one dish meal.  As with any pasta convenience product - don't overcook the noodles.<br /><br />This one's on our repeat list.

Everything of hers that I have tried has been very good.  My family's favorite is the Creamy Tuna.  Since no one really cares for tuna, I substitute canned chicken instead - Fantastic!!!  It has a smooth, creamy, sweet (not bitter) flavor.

review/summary: Tuna Helper is Better and It's Cost Effective to Buy Instead
review/text: In my extended family, we have diabetics, low carb-ers and a few who are gluten intolerant. I tried the Mrs Leeper's creamy tuna but we find it's on the bland side and just not as tasty as Tuna Helper.<br /><br />Instead I buy gluten free pasta and low carb pasta and packages of Tuna Helper (which I get for around 1.70 each) and I make two separate Tuna Helpers, one using gluten free pasta and one using low carb pasta. It's no more expensive than buying the Mrs. Leeper tuna dinners and in fact is probably a bit cheaper, it tastes better and I can satisfy the needs of both the diabetics and the gluten intolerant members of the family. I can also add as little or much pasta - either low carb or gluten free - as is necessary for how many people will be eating it. Like alot of the other reviewers, I also add more tuna than the recipe calls for and a veggie.<br /><br />My husband and I are both type 2 diabetics. I save the regular pasta that comes in the Tuna Helper meal and when I have guests who can eat regular pasta, I serve it to them so we all get what we need/want and I'm not wasting anything.<br /><br />One last thing is that Tuna Helper comes in several varieties so we don't get tired of it. I serve it probably at least once a month.

review/text: This is one of my favorite gluten-free meals. The noodles are good and the texture is just right. The spices and flavor are great. I use canned chicken instead of tuna for a different taste. I also use more water and milk (I use soy milk)than called for to get a jucier dish. You can experiment by gradually adding more each time you make it until you get it just right. I also double the amount of canned chicken or tuna. I buy it by the case to make sure I always have it on hand. Super product! And super service from Amazon!

I work full time and have two small children, this is GREAT for a quick meal and I don't have to feel guilty. I'm definatly a fan of Mrs. Leeper's. I love her corn pastas as well. My italian husband also enjoyed her pastas. He said he would have never known it was GF if I hadn't have told him. The only complaint I have about Mrs. Leepers pasta, the next day cold pasta salads aren't as good as when warm. Still tastey, but the texture toughens up a bit. I'm still a fan! I'd recommend it. Heck, if you GF with kids who are or aren't GF, I'd even recommend the case!!

Of the 6 cans we received, 3 of them were badly dented in and it did not happen in shipping because the box was in excellent condition.  This leads me to beleive that they were dinged that badly when they were packed.  If I had ordered them all for gifts, they would not have been suitable.  I then called the company to let them know I was unhappy with the condition of the cans received and I left messages at least 3 times with my name & phone number and none of those calls were returned.  I will not ever order this product again through Amazon and I think you should check into this since it is a reflection on Amazon as well.

review/summary: Lecithin and Cayenne
review/text: All you you have to do is search the web for Lecithin and Cayenne.  Lecithin is a natural emulsifier that suspends fat in your bloodstream instead of on your arterial walls.<br /><br />Cayenne is a vasodilator that lowers blood-pressure and increases blood-flow.<br /><br />This unique combination both lowers cholesterol and reduces blood-pressure plus it reduces plaque on arterial walls.  There is no excuse not to try this homeopathic remedy.<br /><br />Personally, I take one cup of hot water with one dropper-full of cayenne tincture (homemade) and one tablespoon of lecithin with one teaspoon of granulated garlic per day.  I don't take any statins whatsoever; nor, do I take the hypertension drugs at the high-dosages I used to.  My blood-pressure and cholesterol are both within the safe ranges.<br /><br />As a replacement for the statins, I take presciptions fish oil (Lovaza) and niacin (Niaspan) daily as medications.<br /><br />Comment if you want to know how I make my cayenne tincture.  Also, check lobelia if it applies to you.

It's yummy in yogurt, smoothies, and protein shakes. It's also good sprinkled on salads because of its mild, friendly flavor. BOTTOM LINE: This is now another staple in my home; it'll keep my liver from having to deal with the capsules, etc. TIP: Store it in the refrigerator or freezer.

review/summary: Cherry syrup for adults
review/text: My on-going love affair with Amoretti syrups continue, the latest installment is the cherry syrup.<br /><br />This syrup is cherry syrup, not like Slurpee flavoring, but a true cherry flavor. We made our morning coffee in hot mode for me and frozen for my husband. The flavoring tasted better in the frozen mocha, most likely because he also used the good Amoretti dark chocolate syrup in his.<br /><br />Another win!<br /><br />I've been in contact with this company about different flavors so I could make the right purchase (quite a few flavors have multiple options. Vanilla, for instance.) This company has taken AMAZINGLY great care of us. When I asked some questions and told them that we were amassing enough syrup to last through the next nuclear winter, Paul overnighted the standing order of this syrup. We also received a goodie box out of the kindness of their hearts.<br /><br />So far, out of all the companies I have dealt with, I have received professional customer care at best and have dealt with frontally lobotomized troglodytes at worst (somehow it takes something out of it when you have to explain the insult to the identified individual). This company has been like dealing with close friends, to the point that even the thank you note was hand written!! High class company selling high end products, a rare combination and I'm glad I followed the winding links to them. It's been a real treat, from purchase to consumption.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious Italian Soda/Seltzer syrup!
review/text: We use flavored syrups (such as Torani) to make Italian Soda or Seltzer with sparkling water. We like the light taste better than soda and are glad to be reducing our intake of sugar and sodium. I just received my Amoretti Cherry flavored Syrup. Let me just say, this is DELICIOUS. I absolutely love it. I cannot wait to try the other flavors we received. Also, the company provided AMAZING customer service!!<br /><br />One helpful hint when using these syrups: If using them in cold drinks, such as soda, first place a small amount of the sparkling water in your glass. Add the syrup and stir until dissolved. THEN finish adding the sparkling water to fill your glass. Also, it is better to start with less syrup than what you need, then add a little at a time to taste.<br /><br />I love the Amoretti bottles. They are very attractive and I don't mind leaving them out on the counter at all. Plus they are made of plastic, so if the kids knock them over, I don't have to worry about them breaking.
