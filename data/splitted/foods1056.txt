review/summary: Not a bargain
review/text: Years ago this espresso was an acceptable blend with a bargain price.  For the past year or so it has been terrible.  I use a pump machine but I doubt that a drip maker would do any better.  I suspect they are buying reject beans to stay at the bottom of the price scale.  If you are looking for a budget brand try Bustello in the yellow can

review/text: I don't know what it is about this specific variety of espresso, but everytime I make a latte with it, I get a jittery caffeine high from it.  It's strange - Other varieties of dark roasted bean don't have this much of an effect on me.  I've joked with co-workers that the company must be adding extra caffeine to the product.  Who knows?

review/summary: Product size still not updated
review/text: A previous reviewer from August '10 noted that the description and picture states these cans are 11 ounces when in fact what you receive are 10 ounce sized cans.<br /><br />Well, it's half a year later and Amazon has still not updated this product.  I guess even Italian espresso is utilizing the underhanded business practice of lowering the quantity of the goods you receive, but not changing the price at all, similar to what so many other food companies are doing, canned tuna among them.  The coffee is still a great product, just be aware you are getting about 7% less of it for the same price.<br /><br />(UPDATE: Well, I just checked back today--last day of June 2011--and FINALLY the product size of this item has been updated. Too funny though--if you look close at the picture for it it still shows an 11 oz. can! Haha! Also, someone commented that this is not technically really "Italian Espresso" because it's not produced in Italy...well, whatever, the name is Italian so it's a valid mistake and pardon me all to hell.)

review/summary: Wife's pack
review/text: Wife used this pack on our 10 mile excursion into the San Juan Wilderness area. Seems to work just o.k. The only real complaint is the non-standard hydration bladder compartment. I purchased two camelback bladders. My pack has two vertical compartments in main section. This pack uses a "square" bladder in the fanny pack section. We just zipped her bladder in the vertical outside pocket. Worked pretty good that way. Being able to access the bottom of the pack without unloading everything is a nice feature. It is just o.k. because of the price, and non-standard hydration compartment. Also, unrolling 4 feet(exageration) of material to load top is a pain.

The mango is delicious, tastes like the fresh fruit, has absolutely nothing else added to it. And since they are 3oz containers, 1 or 2 will fit in the plastic baggie you put your liquids in for airport security. They are also a great convenience in the car.

review/summary: Our picky baby loves this food!
review/text: Our 7-month-old daughter doesn't like most solid foods.  She eats a few bites of everything we give her before turning up her nose at the rest.  We've tried vegetables and cereals and meats and fruits (and all combinations of the above) in many different brands.  We were beginning to lose hope that we'd ever get her eating significant quantities of solid foods when we tried Plum Organics Just Mangos.  For the first time ever, our daughter ate an entire serving of solid food in one sitting.  She ate the entire pouch, and we were astonished.  Needless to say, we immediately ordered more.

review/summary: Just as good -if not better - as homemade!
review/text: With my first child (now 3.5yrs) there wasn't a whole lot of options for organic and/ or natural baby food and I had a lot more time so I made all her food (except hurricane rations).  But with the addition of my second (now almost 5mths) and the need to travel a lot more I just don't have that luxury & worried about what to do.  Our pediatrician suggested going ahead and offering first foods @ 4mths but I was panicked at the idea of either finding 3-4hrs to make his food or feeding him the discolored, watered out, over processed stuff.  Then I found out that Plum (among others) make quality organic food with no add-ins for relatively cheap but I still didn't want to buy in bulk so I was happy to find it in a local store.<br /><br />I LOVE that the "Just" line is just that - nothing but what it says on the pouch; no water, no preservatives, no gelatin NOTHING, the mangoes are nothing but organic pureed mangoes what a novel idea!  Yes they are thin & runny but if you've ever pureed mangoes yourself you'd know that's their natural state anyways.  I love that they make spoons specifically to fit on the pouches & that works great too but for now at least mangoes are a little too sweet in full for my son.  So I mix a tablespoon or so into oatmeal & he can't get enough (literally he cries between spoonfuls because it's not coming fast enough!).  And since they're pouches it's easy to pack several into a bag for a trip, open one, use a little bit then close it & it takes up no room in a small hotel refrigerator.  It's a lot easier then the pureeing, straining, freezing, thawing ordeal of making it yourself, I don't have to worry about containers breaking in the freezer or diaper bag nor do I have to keep (a new) pouch cold to maintain safety.<br /><br />Overall excellent product, well worth the slight extra cost!

review/summary: Great basic baby food of a yummy variety
review/text: A big win for finding a basic baby food for the four month old that is something OTHER than the basic apple.  He LOVED mango - I must admit it tastes pretty good.  I will say that this is somewhat more liquid than many baby foods, I think because it is JUST Mangoes - no added water, no concentrate, just the texture of finely pureed mango.  We mixed it with Oatmeal cereal to feed him a breakfast he loved.  Now he is older (9 months) and actually likes to drink it out of the pouch.  He wouldn't have anything to do with baby food after finding finger foods, but the pouch approach made it all new and fun again.

review/summary: Truth in Advertising
review/text: BRS is neither organic, safe for diabetics, nor does it enter the bloodstream slower than other sweeteners.<br /><br />BRS is an entirely man-made food which exists no where in nature. It is made by harvesting enzymes from bacteria, mixing them with ground rice flour, and cooking the mix to simulate the action of salivary and pancreatic amylase. This is EXACTLY the procedure used in laboratories to study the digestion of polysaccharides.<br /><br />The result of this process is a concoction which consists of large amounts (~50%) of maltose and glucose, with a glycemic index of 105 and 100 respectively. Simply ingesting a teaspoon of this stuff will make your face flush with a sugar rush.<br /><br />Under no circumstances should BRS be taken by anyone with diabetes. It will almost certainly result in hyperglycemia. Yes, it tastes good, but so does maple syrup, and that is a MUCH, MUCH better choice for sweetening foods.<br /><br />The primary user for BRS is Cliff Bars. Buyer beware!

review/text: I love this product for these reasons:<br /><br />*It's great in candy-making.  I've substituted it for Corn syrup (Caro syrup) with great success.  Use it next time you make peanut brittle!<br />*It's organic.<br />*Brown rice syrup enters the system more slowly than many sweeteners, so it doesn't give as much of a 'sugar high' because the body takes it in over time.  The technical expression for this is that it is lower on the "glycemic index" than many sweeteners--I've read that it's better in this way than molasses, maple syrup, sugar, and even raw honey!<br />*It is one of my favorite sweeteners in terms of taste.  It has a subdued caramel-like flavor.<br /><br />I like it on waffles too.

review/summary: Two out of Three!
review/text: I have 3 dogs. One is a lab who'll eat anything. One is a poodle who is a very picky eater and the third is also a picky eater, a mutt.<br /><br />My poodle wouldn't touch them but my lab tried to scarf down the entire bag. And my mutt loves them! So 2/3 of my dogs love these treats. They're a great size for training and are also don't have that stench that usually accompanies dog treats.

review/summary: Dog loves them
review/text: I bought these last week from Amazon. The treats arrived quickly, but more importantly, my dog LOVES them. He loves to eat sweet potatoes and apples, so these were perfect for him. They are chewy and low in calories. I just now ordered another bag of these, and another bag in the "yam berry" flavor.

review/text: These really give me a nice burst of energy. I drink one before the gym if Im dragging and they purk me right up!  I buy these at the gas station on the corner next to my gym for $1.99.  On here they work out to be $2.87 each with the crazy shipping charge. I was hoping to find these cheaper if I bought in bulk. So far, Im finding that my ritual of stopping and buying one at time on my way to gym is the cheapest option so far.

review/summary: Craviing bagels while on a low carb diet? This fits the bill! Only one quibble
review/text: These are dense, flavorful and a great addition for low carb dieters. They are also very filling. No, they aren't all that cheap but you can freeze a package and use them sparingly. If you're comparing costs, think about how costly it is to buy new clothing when you gain or lose weight.<br /><br />My only quibble? I can't cut them in half for the toaster! They crumble when I try -  but my spouse doesn't seem to have this problem and is the delegated "bagel cutter" of the family. It is a bit frustrating when my spouse isn't around to help out - but a few seconds in the microwave and they are warm enough for me to eat with the usual bagel toppings - cream cheese or butter or jam or lox, etc. I just can't get them to go ON any bagel halves that I cut but it isn't a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />Don't buy these if you're expecting that pure bagel taste that can only come from plenty of carbs added to the dough. These have their own taste which we find delicious. They are also denser than the bagels we used to eat but this is not an issue for us. All of these factors are offset by the variety added to our low-carb diets!

review/text: I've had Intelligentsia coffee before and it's excellent. But I should have ordered directly from the company. For one thing, the product page here doesn't tell you that these beans are pre-ground. But the main problem is that they are FIVE MONTHS OLD. The label on the bottom says they were roasted in May. I brewed a cup and it was undrinkable. And I just learned that it is unreturnable. 13 dollars wasted.

review/summary: Love the coffee,  but hate the incorrect packaging description
review/text: I've ordered Baronet's Dark Kenya AA pods several times now, and just love the deep, rich cup of joe that my Senseo can extract from these. No complaints about the pods and their use with my machine. However...<br /><br />When I saw that the pods were now being offered in these smaller pouches instead of the wastefully overpackaged boxes, I was intrigued. My typical concern with these pouches is that if each pod typically isn't individually wrapped, they can grow stale if I don't move through them quickly enough. Since I saw in multiple places in the product description that these were still individually wrapped, I decided to check it out.<br /><br />Sadly, I must report that the staff at Amazon goofed on this product description big time. These pouches contain 18 loose pods that are not individually wrapped. While I love this coffee, I'll be switching back to the other packaging after I drink these up. Baronet, please don't get rid of the individually wrapped pods. In fact, it would be great if Amazon offered individually wrapped pods in bulk much like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005IX97">Espressione 100% Arabica Coffee Pods, Box of 150</a> espresso pods.<br /><br />== UPDATE ==<br />Here's another buyer beware note: although these are still packed 18 to a package, each pod has been downsized by 25%! With the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LQNUO0">Baronet Coffee Dark Roast Kenya AA Coffee Pods, 18-Count Box (Pack of 3)</a>, each pod is a nice and rotund 10 grams; this product shrinks each to a skimpy 7.5 grams (yet each of smaller pods in less packaging are less the two cents cheaper than the bigger ones. As such, each smaller pod isn't producing nearly as robust a mug (double-cup) of coffee as the other version of Baronet's Dark Roast Kenya AA pods. I guess I should have zoomed in all the way on the picture to read the fine print on the packaging (or pulled out my calculator to figure out how many grams were in 4.7 ounces).

review/text: I have to say I love this coffee. I was a tad too bold for me when I first tried it after using Senseo Dark Roast for years. But I have gotten used to it now.  The senseo is sooooo much better than Keurig (I have been in situations where it was the only thing available. It just isn't as good). I hate that Senseo makers and pods aren't in our US markets anymore. If you love senseo like I do adn love your coffee maker this coffee is a good fit. I hope Baronet keeps providing these.  Part of me wants to stock up in case they discontinue them as well lol<br /><br />Ive tried several of the Baronet Pods and this blend is my fav.

review/summary: Absolutely the best black tea you will find
review/text: This is the best black tea I have ever found. My husband is Chinese and we are both very picky when it comes to teas. This is pure, clean, very nice taste. No bitterness, gently sweet on its own, and we use the leaves at least twice in our tea maker. We love it and will not buy any other brand. We're very pleased to find it on Amazon because we used to have to talk relatives into going to our "old" store in Michigan and then ship it to us.<br /><br />I wish the shipping were less, but I wouldn't pass it up just because of that because there is no other tea that matches it in price, clarity and flavor. We buy the one lb. can because it has the same shipping as the 1/2 lb. can, saving us a little bit overall.<br /><br />If the shipping were not just about half the price of a can of it, this would receive a five star rating and more if I could give it.

The Lichee fruit sweetens this hardy black tea - makes it smooth.  I do not use sugar or anything in my tea.  If you put anything in this tea you are wasting the best tea made.  I drink it hot or at room temperture. I am a purest about this tea - it does not need anything added.  I quit using sugar in tea when I was 15.  You can not appreciate the full flavor if you add anything to this perfect tea.  This is the only food product I buy that is maded in China. It can not be beat.  If you can find a better Black Tea let me know.<br />On coffee I am not a purest.  I like any very dark strong coffee with half & Half and<br />truvia.  In France use two creams and truvia and cut with knife and Fork.

review/summary: Greenies Allergy Formula Pill Pockets for Dogs
review/text: I love this product. I have to give my dog medicine on a daily basis and he takes them like treats using pill pockets. I normally buy the capsule (as opposed to tablet) size and just pull off as much as I need to cover the size pill Dexter has to take. This makes the product last longer. Dexter thinks they're a treat and just gobbles it down medicine and all.<br /><br />The one draw back for me is the smell of the Allergy formula pockets - it's pretty bad! I've used the beef flavor in the past and don't remember the smell being so bad. I had to stop using the beef formulas because after finally reading the ingredients I found it had chicken broth/stock in it and my dog is allergic to chicken. Not sure why they put chicken of any kind in a beef version but I've found this in many beef products.

review/summary: My dog can still taste the pills, and spits them out
review/text: My dog had been taking pills without issue for several months.  Due to a recent surgery, her daily pill count has gone up dramatically, and it has become increasingly difficult to get her to take them. I have heard many people saying how wonderfully these pill pockets work, so I finally decided to give them a try.  First, I think they are ridiculously expensive (although reasonable at Amazon, these cost almost 30% more at my local pet store, where I unfortunately bought them).  Second, if the pills taste bad (particularly if they are tablets that are cut in half to lower the dosage), it is likely that your dogs will still spit them out if they are anything like mine.  I was hoping for the magic solution to pill taking, but this is not it.

review/summary: Works for sneaky Lab
review/text: Our Choc Lab is very sneaky about hiding his dialy asperin in nooks and crannies of his mouth and then spitting is out later. The vet recommended I get the capsule size pill pockets and tear them into 2. That way I get 2 days out of each one. I place the asperin inside and press to seal the edges. Pop it into his mouth and he thinks he has a new treat added to his morning treats! Problem solved.

review/summary: The dogs love these.
review/text: Our vet prescribed medication for one of our dogs (a medium sized pill) that she refused to swallow.  We tried the Pill Pockets and night became day.  Our dog now looks forward to taking her medication in the morning and at night.  In fact our other dog thinks she should have one of these "treats" at the same time.  We're able to split the Pill Pocket in half so it only takes one to cover both the morning and evening medications.  The Pill Pockets are moist, can be divided into 2 pieces by hand, and can be molded around the pill to cover sharp edges.  What a great product.

Because my dogs and the pills are small I can divide the pocket in half and form one around each dog's pill. They swallow it and beg for more, excited about a special treat.

review/text: I should have realized it from the picture that these pill pockets are for DOGS! I searched "Greenies pill pocket cats" and this popped up. I saw the price and thought, "Hey! That's great" and placed my order. I didn't even notice the mistake until I opened the package and went to pull out a pill pocket and it was huge!<br />  That being said, I think Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome! My cat will eat them without any fuss and I do not have to worry about how I will give him his pills. But before you order, just make sure you're ordering for the type of pet you want to be ordering for!

review/summary: Greenie Pill Pockets are my friend.
review/text: I have a dog with arthritis and hates to take pills. She does not gulp her food, she chews everything. I wrapped the pill in everything to entice her to take it.  It is bitter, not only to the taste but she could  smell it in everything I tried. Braunswager (sp) Vienna Sausage, everything.  I wrap it well in the Greenie Pill Pocket and she eats it right up. I ordered two packages and both contents were in perfect shape.  No crumbs, no pieces, none smashed as I have read in other reviews.  Since the stores that carry these are not in my immediate shopping area, I find it's easier to order from Amazon along with other items I need. I will order again and I have already recommended to a friend and neighbor.

review/text: My dog suffers from an auto immune disorder which causes him to have to take a lot of meds. He also is on a novel protein diet and can't have many "normal" dog treats or food. After trying a million ways to get those pills in him I found these in the reduced allergen flavor. Yes, they stink horribly. But suddenly meal time is a treat and I couldn't be happier! Just wish more came in a bag and they were cheaper.

review/text: I'd always heard of Pill Pockets and thought they were just stupid. Why pay a lot for treats with a hole in them when you can just wrap some cheese around the pill? Until my dog got so sick she refused to eat anything at all. The vet gave me some of these to try, and she would eat them and the pills inside right away, when she refused to eat anything else.<br /><br />I've also discovered they make great training treats, because you can break off small pieces without dropping crumbs everywhere. I've always had problems with treats that leave crumbs because my dogs spend more time hunting for crumbs than listening to me. Wish I'd started using these years ago!

review/summary: This is a great size for savings!
review/text: I have used well over a dozen of the beef flavored 3.2 oz, tablet size. The Amazon.com Prime supply ran out of the 3.2 size, so I thought I'd go ahead and try these. One of my dog's daily liver supplements are rather large. Still, it fits in a half of one of this size. Just 1/4 will cover his smaller daily meds. I use a knife to cut them, but it's hardly necessary. The pill pockets easily mold around any shape.<br /><br />Even though the prices vary, it's still just a few cents more for this size. Twice as much, for a few pennies! Makes the pill pockets way more affordable for me.<br /><br />My 14 year old dog still takes them, even when he's not feeling very well. Makes pill taking a treat, rather than an upsetting battle.

review/summary: Kinda Dry & Rubbery
review/text: I was hoping this would be as good as the beef & chicken pill pockets but these were dry and rubbery.  I had a hard time getting the pocket to stay wrapped around the pill.  AND it really smells - not too good - although my dog doesn't seem to be turned off by that. (Of course with most dogs - the smellier the better....)  She does appear to like the taste - just wish it wasn't as rubbery as these seem to be.  Maybe it's because of it being `Allergy Formula' and doesn't contain the stuff that keeps it from being dry?  The number of ingredients is a lot less than the beef pockets....

review/text: Greenies Pill Pockets are the only way to give my dog his meds.  In one pill pocket we can get the two capsules, powder supplement and a large chewable tablet that he gets in the morning.  He has never spit it out or not taken it.  We use two bags a month so we needed a cheaper source than the local retail stores, we looked on-line and Amazon has the best price. I can buy a six month supply and it doesn't break the bank.  Good product, great price and super quick delivery.

He needed to take pills for a few weeks to clear up a skin condition, but half the time he would spit the pill out.  First time trying the pill pockets and he gobbled it right down.  Never had a problem giving the pills again.  I guess for a dog who is picky about treats it might not work, but for ours it was a perfect solution.  He thought he was getting a delicious treat.

review/summary: No More Hassles
review/text: These make giving your pet medicine as easy as giving them a treat. Most people don't know these can also be used with liquids. My older dog has always been good at taking pills anytime we want her to, but now her medicine is in drop form.  She needs to take 10 drops twice a day.  It is very hard to know if she is really getting what she is intended without the Pill Pockets. Just put the drops in the pocket and pinch it shut. If you are using the Pill Pockets for pills and have a pet that knows all the tricks try this. Put the pill in the pill pocket with one hand and close the pocket with the other. Never touch the pocket with the hand that touched the pills, your pet can tell. Take another pocket or two with nothing in it break it into a couple of pieces and give it to your pet as a treat. Try this treat, treat with pill, and treat again.

I do not like choking pills down the dogs, and they don't like it either! Now, everybody is happy.  I also checked this product at Petco and Petsmart-much higher, almost double.  One piece of advice is the beef is a little better on the hands and doesn't feel quite so slimy.  I prefer the beef.  My youngest Schnauzer did figure out the pill part, but that was easy to deal with. Just act like you are going to give another, and they wolf it down. lol

review/summary: Finally...
review/text: I have to admit, I was skeptical of these to begin with.  Our dog is a master of avoiding medication.  We've tried shoving pills down her throat, we've tried squirting liquid medication into her mouth, we've tried hiding pills in her food, we've even tried grinding tablets or opening caplets and mixing the powder with her food.  She's always able to avoid it.  Even when we mix it with her food, she'll refuse to eat for days.<br /><br />These things actually work though.  I highly recommend the smaller size, because the larger size requires a bit of chewing, and so our dog was able to remove one of the pills once.  Even 29/30 is pretty good.  The small ones are perfect though - 60/60 and counting.  Even if the pill is slightly too big, you can just mold the treat around it so it can't be immediately detected.<br /><br />I wish I had found these years ago...

review/summary: Pill Pockets Help Reluctant Pill Takers
review/text: We first encountered these at a vet's office and tried them, but recently I have been buying via Amazon for convenience and price. The capsule ones help get various pills, including fish oil, into our two dogs. They gobble them down. They are very soft and can be reformed around whatever pill(s) you are giving. I did try the chicken and couldn't stand the smell of them myself, although the dogs were happy with either kind. These are a tiny bit greasy, so I always put a napkin down on the counter before inserting pills, and the smell will persist until you wash your hands (or you will continue to be pestered by yours dogs! This has been a great solution to get most pills down without the dog spitting them out.

review/summary: Pill pockets, what a great idea!
review/text: This is the best thing ever for giving meds in pill form to a pet.  Each little "pocket" is the consistency of a soft brownie.  So they are easy to mold around even a large pill.  I have 2 dogs and both take meds with these, no picking them apart, they just swallow them whole!  Both of my dogs are small (20#) so I usually don't even use a whole pocket for their meds, I break one in half and it's plenty to cover the pill.  Great solution and really makes things so much easier when pets are sick and not even wanting to eat.  I will always keep these on hand now.

I don't even need to use the whole treat. I rip off about a third and they are soft so I mold it around the capsule. I then make her work for it by giving a few commands "sit, stay, come, etc" and she does them excitedly. After she gets her treat, she is so excited that she does a lap around the apartment. Overall, these pill pockets are a winner and I will use them as long as she keeps getting pills!

review/summary: Is your dog too smart for his/her own good?
review/text: My little dog is a Japanese Chin. Giving him medicine requires more effort than the building of the Pyramids and years of combat training. Enter the Pill Pocket. These little gems are amazing. If you're dog can smell a pill from a mile away, try these. Sometimes in his morning dose, I have to dip it in gravy (which I buy at KFC every couple weeks and keep in the fridge), but that's the most additional effort I've had to exert since we started with these. Get them, use them, enjoy them. Warning, they're pretty stinky, IMO, so don't spend too much time sniffing them.
