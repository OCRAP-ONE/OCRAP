review/summary: Dogs showed zero interest
review/text: I bought these antlers for my adult Doberman, my Catahoula Leopard Dog, and my Doberman puppy. All three like to chew on pig ears, rawhide, busybones, ect. After reading reviews about antler dog chews, I thought that purchasing the antlers may offset the cost of constantly buying rawhide since the antlers are supposed to last about a month. Unfortunately, none of the dogs even gave the antlers 5 minutes of chew time. This product may be better for people with heavy duty chewers. I read that the inside of the antlers are the best tasting for the dogs, but it doesn't look like my dogs will ever get to the inside. I will not be purchasing any antlers again, and I'm out $30+. As for the seller, I did receive this product in a timely manner. Note that the antlers are  placed in an envelope without any packaging.

review/summary: The only Walden Farms product that disappoints
review/text: I have been a fan of Walden Farms pancake syrup as well as their chocolate syrup and the jams.  So I had high hopes about their ranch dip.  UGH!  I'm sorry to have to say it, since their other products are great, but this was an unpleasant esperience.  The texture managed to be both slimy and clingy.  I thought the taste was particularly unpleasant and I threw the entire content away.  Kept the jar, though - Walden Farms uses nice glass jars!  So I am still a fan of theirs, and I will continue to buy other products from them, but NOT this one.

review/summary: This is just wrong...
review/text: My son doesn't like peas.  I've tried feeding him the Gerber Organic peas and he dodges the spoon.  So since all of sprouts food is good, I thought - hey, I'm sure Tyler Florence's peas are better than Gerber.  Boy was I wrong!  It started when I first opened the bag - it smells absolutely horrible and the color is a yucky brownish green.  So I warmed it up and sampled it before giving to my son.  OMG, I almost had to wipe it off of my tounge.  It is really really bad, and that is about the kindest thing I can say about this pea/greenbean/mint mix.  I tried to give it to my son and his reaction was as bad as mine.  I just coulnd't force feed him somethign I couldn't stomach myself.  So far all other Sprout flavors are 5 stars, but leave this one on the shelf - - - it is BAD!

review/summary: Introduce a wide variety of flavors now
review/text: I am a big fan of Sprout baby foods and so is my 6 month old son. We started with stage 1 but quickly went on to the yummy combinations of the stage 2 foods. The flavors all work so well together and I believe I am expanding my son's palet now so he's more likely to accept and like a wide variety of foods and flavors as he gets older. The beans with mint is a unique and welcomed twist on an otherwise tough veggie to get infants to eat.  If you MUST you can always add just a small pinch of sugar. My son loves it.  Keep coming up with the fabulous flavors Tyler!

review/summary: unsatisfied with the food, and disappointed with their customer service
review/text: Bought it form amazon , and found some "weird" stuff in 2 out of 4 bags I have opened, and the amount in one bag is quite significant. Looks more like leaf or pea skin to me. Contacted their customer service, and sent the picture I shared here. They told me it's "quite unusual" in the first email. In the 2nd email told me it is called "browning" generated during the process on rare occasions, and emphasised that "it is not a safe issue" wihile they are trying to improve to prevent this happen again. They offered coupons for replacement in both emails. As we are relocated out of the country, I asked if they could mail the replacement instead of coupons which is useless to us. They stop replying email and my other inquiries, and don't even bother to say a "no".<br /><br />We carried this a long way with us, and it turned out that we are not comfortable to feed it to our baby anymore. The pouch shows dark green, and strong smell. Definitely not "a slightly sweet puree with a bright green color" as stated on the package. We also supplied Gerber and happy baby stage 2 food. This is the only food that my girl disliked.<br /><br />Unsatisfied with the food, and really disappointed with their customer service.

review/text: OK, I admit I did not actually try these myself.  However, my son really loves them.  I was suprised to see the negative reviews of this product, as they seem very appetizing.  They're a nice green color and the mint adds a good smell to them.<br /><br />It's actually hard for me to find veggie-only (no fruit) organic baby food at my local grocery store. I really like that these are a way to get my son veggies that he likes.  The packaging is convinient--it reseals well in the fridge.  I also find the pouches great for throwing in the diaper bag when we go out.  They're a bit pricey, but I think worth it for the convinience and the quality.

review/text: I dont know what all the bad reviews are about? This is practically the only all veggie organic baby food option i could find, 99% have a sweet fruit mixed in to mask the vegetable flavor so baby will eat it, if you prefer that thats your choice but for any foodies out there you'll appreciate the mild hint of mint in this combo. No its not 'overwhelming' as some state IMO its just a hint and its mint..not a chemically added flavor so whats the problem?? its an all organic all veggie option for those interested.

review/summary: The only food my child has refused
review/text: I have given my child a wide variety of fruits and vegetables so far, and this is the only food that we have offered him that he has flat out refused.  I try everything that I give him, and I almost gagged when I tasted this.  The mint taste is very overpowering.  I was not expecting mint to be mixed with green beans and peas.  But I did not want to force my likes and dislikes on to my son, so I sent this off to daycare with him and also stashed an extra pouch of organic carrots in his bag just in case.  Needless to say, my son came home with a full pouch of this, an empty pouch of carrots, and a note saying that he absolutely refused to eat this.  They even tried to trick him and dip the peas/beans in to the carrots and it was still a no go.  My son eats up peas alone, but there is something about this combination that does not work.

review/summary: Didn't like the flavor...
review/text: Baby reviews are hard, as it's all in how the LO reacts, and every little darling is different. Mine did not like this. She loves her green beans, and she loves her peas (we get the earths best), but she gagged on these. My guess is the mint. I tried it before giving it to her, and didn't like the taste, but figured it was worth a try. I'm sure some babies would love it, but mine was not a fan. The after taste it left in my mouth was not good, so I imagine that was part of it as well. Thankfully we had just purchased a single pack of it at Walmart, so we were only out the single, so before purchasing this larger pack, I would get a single somewhere local. We like a lot of the sprouts organic baby foods, but this one just wasn't for us. :)

My daughter is an adventurous eater, and always eats every last bit out of these pouches.  She only eats them when we are traveling as I make most of my own baby food, or just feed her what we are eating.  The only negatives I have found are with the sugar levels of the cereals (peach rice pudding, etc).  The first ingredient is fruit juice.

review/text: I was disappointed to see the low rating on this product, I had to give my two cents.<br /><br />We opened a pouch of sweet peas & beans last night.  My son wanted no part of it.  He would not open his mouth.  Today, we tried it again.  He devoured it.<br /><br />He's our first baby and it seems that every meal, every food is hit or miss.  Like us I think he might just not be in the mood for it, or maybe wants something else?<br /><br />No matter the reason, I love the Sprout pouches.  I've tasted each one and they are much better than some other baby foods.  I also make some of my own baby food and mine lack flavor diversity.  So Sprout is a good way to get him into new foods.

review/text: I love these bars. They are primarily seed based, so if you don't love seeds then you won't love these bars. However, they are Gluten-free, Dairy-free & GMO-free if you're looking to rid yourself of any of the above mentioned items. Also, they are vegetarian and possibly vegan depending on your stance on honey.<br /><br />Personally, I just wanted a snack bar that was gluten free, soy free, msg free, preservative free and tasted good. That's what I got here! I like the cranberry version too.<br /><br />These bars are a bit expensive and difficult to find in stores.  The Whole Foods here in Raleigh used to stock them, but no longer does.  I have to buy them online right now as I haven't found another local store that sells them.  Also, they are a bit crumbly but I never pull mine all the way out of the package so it usually catches the mess for me.<br /><br />Over all, one of my favorite snack bars.

review/text: I had been looking for low sodium products to try, so I was glad to come across this no salt added vegetarian chili. It tastes pretty good. I hardly miss the salt because it had all the flavor and thickness of regular chili, though it was a little too hot for my tastes. I prefer the mild version...but, if you like your chili very hot and spicy, you'll probably love this. I was, however, very disappointed with the packaging of my order...unlike the mild chili I purchased, there was no type of protective bubble wrap or packing peanuts, so all except two cans were badly dented when I received it. I have to say I was suprised with the poor packing of the order as I've never had any issues with Amazon's packing procedures. Other than that, I was satisfied with the product and plan to order more of the mild vegetarian chili.

It's not incredibly spicy (I didn't end up having to put cheese,sour cream or yogurt on it) It vindicates those who believe vegan/vegetarian is bland and awful. Healthy,I'm sure,but not of the "tastes good and good for you too" ilk. There's nothing distinctively Southwestern about it either--like using black beans and blue corn. Fantastic World Foods' Southwestern Chili is not only better, but it's edible and its spiciness it punchy. Avoid this one. It probably is better as compost.

I've found this Kenyan AA to have all the qualities that make a satisfying morning coffee.  To me, it tastes like really good coffee is supposed to.  I've tried many types of K cup coffees and this is always the one I come back to.  I enjoy flavored coffees for later in the day, but my first morning cup needs to be 'pure' and to me, this is as pure and rich as it comes.  If it were wine, it would be called smooth and full-bodied.  If it were chocolate, it would be semi-sweet.  In fact, it reminds me of chocolate because of the roundness of its flavor.<br /><br />For those who like 'rocket fuel' type coffee, this will seem too mild, but to the coffee drinker who prefers medium or even light roast coffee and wants something deeply satisfying, this really fits the bill.<br /><br />Now, if only Amazon would sell it in those big 'frustration free' boxes.  I'd sure buy it.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Really good coffee, but (today) inflated internet price
review/text: This became my favorite coffee after spending a week in Kenya.  While I continue to search for the "right" beans and/or ground Kenyan AA coffee by which to duplicate the "real deal", the appeal of K-Cups--for both home use as well as to insert in my office's Keurig machine--was too much to resist.  I was happy to find the Kenyan AA K-Cups on Amazaon.  However, based on its availability at another just-discovered internet site, it does not make sense to pay 36-60% more (depending on quantity purchased) from Amazon.com, even though I so value its excellent service.

review/text: I love this coffee!  Unfortunately, the only way to get your attention is to give it one star, and I do so because of the pricing issue.  Do not buy the larger quantity.  Order 2 boxes of 24 instead.  Do the math.  You will pay much more if you order 48 than if you order two boxes of 24.  Shame on Amazon.  Those in a hurry may automatically assume there is a savings if they place an order for the larger quantity.  They will be wrong, and feel duped.

review/summary: Most delicious cooking oil, Best Value
review/text: I decided to try rice bran oil when I was on a diet that excluded some other oils and recommended rice bran oil. I tried some from the health food store, and fell in love with the taste, but it was very expensive for a tiny bottle.  I started looking for a bulk source online.  Tophe pure rice bran oil 1/2 gallon, here on Amazon, was the best value I found.<br /><br />It tastes delicious on salads and in cooked foods.  I think it is the most tasty cooking oil I've ever used.  I like it better than olive oil or coconut oil because it doesn't have a strong flavor that would conflict with some foods.  It seems to go with almost everything.  I've ordered this Tophe oil twice now, getting several half gallons each time.  Shipping is a little high, but if you order several at once, it isn't bad at all.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: Like another reviewer (Purple Cloud); I've been purchasing this oil for at least 2 years or longer. I cook quite extenisvely and frequently utilize high end products and equipment to complete my recipes. Many of these items I either purchase online or in specialty food markets. I happened to be reading a cooking magazine or some such material that listed the health and cooking benefits of rice bran oil (helps to reduce cholesterol and it has none, has no trans fats, and has vitamin E among other benefits). This oil also has a very light, almost non-flavor which is great when you lightly sautee delicate vegetables, such as asparagus. I don't want my oil competing with the flavor of my food in some cases. Because of the light flavor, I actually bake with this oil and have absolutely no residual oil taste. I don't even think I own any canola or vegetable oil. I also love the fact that this has a high smoke point (490 degrees) higher than peanut oil as a matter of fact, which is absolutely great when I want to sear meat in a pan. As does everyone else, I also want to save as much money as I can, especially when I am purchasing high end products. To save money purchasing this oil, I actually order this directly from Honest Foods.com, which is cheaper than the listed Amazon price, although this oil is being sold here by Honest Foods. I also look for coupon codes when ordering from Honest Foods to save even more money. I typically also purchase two or more at a time and Honest Foods reduces the price to $8 per 1/2 gallon. I have never had my oil "go bad" and simply store it in a cupboard, and I do not deep fry anything, so it's not as if I use mass quantities in short duration. This is a great product and everyone should try it. Also, this product is made and processed right here in the United States.

review/text: No kidding.  My wife has been asking me for 40 years why french fried potatoes and other vegetables never turned out right.<br /><br />This Tophe Rice Bran Oil is the answer!  French fries that are brown and crispy on the outside and soft and perfect on the inside.  And no greasy mess. No sagging. And the paper towel you use to absorb excess ends up perfectly clean and dry.<br /><br />This oil is a chef's dream.  I only wish I had discovered it 40 years ago!  If you appreciate vegetables and meats that are perfectly fried - look no further.<br /><br />Don't take my word for it.  You have to try it just once - and you will never settle for anything less.<br /><br />Outstanding oil in every respect and super healthy to boot!

I now use olive oil as my cold oil and exclusively Tophe rice bran oil for all cooking.  The company also ships very fast.

review/summary: The perfect frying oil!
review/text: I had been wanting to try rice bran oil for several months, but couldn't find it anywhere locally.  I even went to an Asian grocery store and they had never heard of it!  After searching I discovered that Amazon had the Tophe 1/2 gallon rice bran oil for a better price than any other that I could find, so I ordered two of them.  I poured both into my deep fryer, and WOW!  I couldn't believe how easily and perfectly everything browned, and everything came out perfectly crispy on the outside.  On the inside, very moist and delicious.  Plus, this oil doesn't soak into the food like a lot of other oils, so you don't really get an oily or greasy taste.  I just received my next three bottles so I can change out the fryer next time.  I'm totally sold on this oil, and I really don't understand why it's not available everywhere. It browns and crisps better than peanut oil, is better for you than canola oil, has a higher smoke point than most oils, has a light taste that doesn't stick to foods, and makes a fantastic coating for charcoal grills to keep food from sticking to them.  After just a few weeks those are my observations, and I'm still finding things I like.  This is really THE PERFECT FRYING OIL.

review/text: I got my order yesterday (prompt delivery) 2/8/2012 and I could not wait to try the oil. So this morning I decided to have an omelette for breakfast. Boy, was I impressed and I am not exaggerating.<br /><br />First, the oil is light and it did not have an after taste. After discovering the blood type diet, I found out that certain oils are not good for my blood type.<br />To add to what other customers have said, this is a great cooking oil with health benefits. I will save my olive oil for cold dressings. Although this half gallon is cheaper(I think its' due to the packaging), I plan to keep the rice bran oil in a dark space until I get a dark bottle to preserve the oil since the shelf life is considered 6-12 months.<br /><br />Cheers to good health!

review/text: I've read that rice bran oil has health benefits most other oils don't have so that's a good thing, but it also has virtually no taste so it doesn't affect the flavor of what you're making.  For delicately flavored dressings, that's a real advantage.<br /><br />The fact that it has a very high smoke point is a joy when saut&eacute;ing something--no more smoky kitchen--and if you're a fan of deep fryers there's no lingering odor after cooking as there is with peanut oil.  I still love olive oil some things, but this is my new favorite for everything where that isn't the appropriate choice.

review/summary: Wonderful product
review/text: I was not sure how I would like this oil, especially since, with a high initial cost, plus high shipping, it's pretty expensive.  However, rice bran oil is much more nutritious and better for you, so, I reasoned that since I don't really use all that much oil, it wouldn't be that big a deal.  I think that I will look around and try to find a source in my area, to save the shipping charges (I live in a highly rural area and there aren't too many health food stores nearby) but if I can't, I'll probably go ahead and order this.  The taste is slightly different, but you get used to it quickly and it's a very lightweight oil, which I found very pleasant.  It also has to get very hot before it will start smoking, so it doesn't make as much odor in your house, if you're cooking something for a long time.  It seems to me that it held a constant temperature better, too.  All in all, I really like it and I like that it's a healthier choice for the few times that I fry something.  Even though it was expensive, I feel that it's worth it, and it's also worth the trouble of looking for a closer sourse.

review/summary: WHY is this wonderful product being discontinued???????????
review/text: Who is the MORON responsible for deciding to discontinue manufacturing of this great tasting gum? This product has always been difficult to get because THE MERCHANTS SAY IT'S POPULAR! American manufacturers are notorious for discontinuing great products so they can avoid doing any manufacturing process that doesn't follow a preset, cookbook methodology requiring as little innovation and creativity to meet consumer needs as possible. The result? They spend all their advertising dollars telling us what we SHOULD like, NOT what we DO like and I, for one, am sick and tired of it! I thought our economic system was based upon supply and demand; apparently it's based how little the capitalists can do, in order to benefit themselves, while ignoring what their customers want. I will buy as much of this gum as I can get my hands on, and will absolutely NEVER buy another product manufactured by do-nothing, greedy Cadbury Adams.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I've been an avid PopChips (100 calories per bag) consumer so far. Much as I enjoy them, I thought it was time to look around at other healthy options. That's where these chips came in. I love avocados and potatoes! So pairing them together could only get better. The chips are crunchy and yummy. My only gripe is that they are a tad oily but considering it avocado oil, I guess it's not that bad. I'm definitely looking forward to trying the other flavors.<br /><br />I didn't see any calorie information on this listing page, so I thought I'd add it. Each bag is about 175 calories and holds a fair amount of chips. Since I like to keep my daily (almost) consumption under 100 calories, I share a bag with my husband:)

review/text: I don't normally eat plain chips and when I saw "Avocado oil" on the package, I hoped there would be a slight avocado taste. Not here. If you like plain, salted chips that are simply cooked in a healthier way, these are good chips. They are crispy, lightly salted and well made but there's no real flavor to these other than potato and salt. I give them a 3.5-4 stars review.

review/summary: OK - Not as good as Shasta Diet Black Cherry
review/text: If Amazon ever offers Shasta Diet Black Cherry get it!<br />Hansen's is a good 2nd choice taste wise but I have had several smashed cans of pop in each case I order.<br />Also allot of cans with pinholes in them & those half or more empty & have to throw away.<br />Also the cans have this Black Soot stuff on them that gets all over your hands, cloths & anything else you touch.  Think it's because of the poor packing of the soda & the cans rubbing together during shipping.<br />Shasta packages their soda so much better!  No Soot!  No smashed cans & No pinholes in their cans!<br />Amazon offers Shasta Diet Soda to purchase but doesn't offer Shasta Diet Black Cherry Soda yet.<br />Why, I don't know.  I know Shasta still makes Diet Black Cherry as I have purchased it at grocery stores.<br />Any Diet Soda that you can purchase from Shasta tastes better & is packaged better than anything Hansen's has<br />to offer.  Also you throw away money with each case you buy because of the cans being smashed & having pinholes<br />in them.  Taste wise Hansen's is a good Second choice for diet soda.<br />Oh that Soot from Hansen's cans..., if you get it on your cloths, it's there Forever!

review/text: I am a soda fanatic, black cherry being my absolute favorite! I mainly stick to diet since I try to watch my weight and not drink the regular sodas that contain 30 grams of sugar. My first natural soda was zevia black cherry, which was delicious however pricey ($6-7 for a six pack). I found this at Trader Joe's ($2.50 for six pack)...tried it...and loved it!!!! It does not have a real "diet-y" taste or bad after taste. The flavor is not weak either like some black cherry sodas I have tried. I look forward to trying other Diet Hansen's sodas.
