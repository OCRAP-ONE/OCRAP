review/summary: Good nuts, but way too expensive
review/text: Very good peanuts if you like the taste of Szechuan peppercorns.  They had a very strong peppercorn flavor and also a nice amount of flavor and heat from the chili peppers.  These nuts also have much more crunch than American roasted peanuts.  I like it, but some people think the Asian nuts are too hard.  My only real problem with this product is the price.  If you have an Asian market anywhere near where you live, you can buy these for less than 1/2 of what I paid for them -- and I bought them from Amazon at clearance sale price.

review/text: I bought these candy rocks for decorating a dinosaur cake. They were so perfect! I used the larger jelly dinosaur eggs as large rocks near the dinosaurs, and the small rocks looked so real around a water area. They also taste great! I would use these again for sure if I make a cake with that kind of look again.

review/text: Worth every penny - fresh and well packed from Maine to Seattle in one day.  Packed in 2 pound "netted" packages surrounded with "blue ice" packages for refrigeration. All in a sturdy styrofoam container and boxed. Out of my 4 pound order, only 3 of the clams were broken and had to be thrown away. All the others were fresh and "closed". Cleaning and cooking instuctions included. Maine steamed clams are one of the most tender varieties - not chewy like little necks or other varieties.  Steam 10 minutes, take beard off neck, dip in butter and arrive in Heaven.

review/summary: My cats love this, and I love what it does for them
review/text: Started mixing this in with my furry persons' regular commercial brand, hoping they wouldn't notice too much and still eat it. No problems there! They loved it from bite one, and now are at the point where their former dry food has been entirely phased out and they're just eating Indigo Moon as their dry food (I'd come across Indigo Moon at a local furry-person store).<br /><br />Within two weeks of starting to feed them Indigo Moon, both my cats' fur have become thicker, shinier, and softer with almost no shedding (whereas before, there had been plenty of shedding - even the dandruff problem with one of them has cleared up) and they also seem to have increased energy (both are five years old).<br /><br />Many dry foods promise "100% nutrition" results, but this one delivered even better than I'd hoped for. My cats look even more gorgeous and seem healthier. This is a keeper, especially at its price, which ran about ten dollars less than the other premium feline brands where I purchased it.

review/summary: Expensive!  For $16 / lb buy a steak or go out!
review/text: This mac and cheese does taste OK and easy enough that my 9 yr old daughter gets to make it herself, but she is still quite hungry afterward.  Also, it is incredibly expensive for the small amount of 'food' in each cup.  Who would have ever thought rice and cheese flavored powder could cost so much.

review/summary: Highly Processed Gluten-Free Junk Food Fix
review/text: **<br />I would only recommend this "meal" to people who enjoy junk food and fast food and who are going to eat it anyway. The good things about this mac and cheese cup are that it tastes pretty good, it is convenient and easy to fix, and there are no dishes. If you want a little taste of fast food (220 calories), but don't want to leave the house, have money to spend and care nothing about nutrition, you've found a terrific product.<br /><br />The negative things:<br />(1) It is super-high in carbohydrates at 40g per 220 calorie serving. Definitely to be avoided if you are diabetic or are pre-diabetic or don't want to be.<br />(2) It is high in sodium at 670mg for just those 220 calories--yikes!<br />(3) The ingredients list is long and reads like a chemical formula. If this is what you eat anyway, you might not care. But if you're used to real food, it does have a kind of synthetic odd off taste to it. I liked it initially, but it lingered with me for a while afterwards and I had to keep drinking water to wash the aftertaste away.<br />(4) It is mostly white rice flour, corn syrup solids (sugar), and fake cheese. Please don't feed this to your children. Whatever you do.<br />(5) As mentioned above, terrible for nutritive value--no nutrition whatsoever besides calcium (6% of your daily requirement) and iron (8% of your daily requirement). No other vitamins or minerals.<br /><br />Only recommended if you're already used to fast food and junk food and if you also don't care one bit about nutrition. I gave it two stars because if you're that type of person anyway, it's not a bad choice as at least you're not getting the gluten. You're not getting anything else either except empty calories, but if you can handle the chemically aftertaste, you might upgrade your diet by avoiding the gluten.<br />**<br />**

review/summary: Perfect GF Mac and Cheese
review/text: I bought these thinking they would be a great addition to my gluten intolerant college age daughter's pantry.We were pleasantly surprised! They were way better than we had hoped! They are very reminiscient of the familiar old blue box of regular wheat mac n cheese that has been around for years! Very easy to fix as well as being so tasty! Moms of little ones with gluten issues would find these instant cups to be a real life-saver when it comes to picky eaters!<br />  Also, I'm not for sure how they have managed this, but after cooking in the microwave for only 3 minutes, this pasta stays warm for a LONG time! Even the very last noodle I have eaten,,from each and every cup I have made, is still warm! Have not eaten a cold noodle yet!(Parents of little one's may want to test the temp before giving to your children. )<br />  I would highly recommend this product to anyone on a gluten free diet! This company gives GF pasta a GOOD name, as well as GREAT TASTE!

review/text: CELIACS REJOICE<br /><br />Finally a take it with you food that really is GOOD.<br /><br />I made it in my small and not so powerful microwave, cooked 3.5 minutes and it was still "soup".  I was afraid to cook it more and chance a yukky cup of mush (been there done that before), so I just let it sit a few more minutes and it was perfect.  No lumps, no funny aftertaste.  The sauce is smooth and the Pasta was the perfect consistency.  The only bad thing I can say is I wished there was more!<br /><br />Bring along a can of tuna, chicken, ham, or bacon bits...and you can "spice it up" and make it a complete meal.<br /><br />Most Celiacs don't miss gluten (or bathrooms), but we do miss the convenience of the occasional need for "fast food"  This fits the bill for adults and I don't know a single child out there who doesn't love Mac N Cheese.<br /><br />Now to the folks at Pastariso, can you come up with a "Dairy Free" version? so those of us who are also Lactose Intolerant don't have to take a pill.... and those with Dairy allergy can enjoy too!  There are some nice non-dairy cheeses out there...Go on - put your heads together and see what you can come up with (I Dare You!)....give it a try!

review/summary: Surprisingly good!
review/text: I've never been a big fan of boxed macaroni and cheese because my mom always made it from scratch with Velveeta.  I ordered a case of these from another site, and when it arrived, I could tell one of the bowls had leaked out into the box.  So, rather than waste it, I poured it back into the cup and went ahead and made it.  Of course, I lost some of the cheese powder in the spill, so I thought I would have to add more cheese to make it taste acceptable, so I was very surprised that I didn't.  Haven't tried a new one yet, so it should be even cheesier.  Very easy to make by only adding water and microwaving, however, this is more of a side dish, not a 'meal' as they call it.

review/summary: Mediocre Mac & Cheese
review/text: First off, I don't own a microwave, so instead of nuking it for 3 1/2 minutes as directions say, I added boiling water to the line, stirred, and returned to the pan to cook (there is actually no printed "stove-top" method, I just used my noodle *pun intended*, and tried it anyway).<br />..For those campers that don't have an RV style kitchen, and are considering this product, this is what you can do!<br /><br />Personally, the taste is neither rave worthy, nor disgusting enough to throw away.  Thankfully I received it at a great discount price (in the $4 range for 6), so I'm not upset about the cash spent.  The sodium count is a bit high though (670 mg. or 28% of  daily value).  I didn't exactly measure the cooked portion, but I would say it's about 1 cup or a tad over.  It DOES have corn (oil) in it, so for those with an allergy, be warned.  It is however "free from wheat, gluten, soy, eggs, and nuts".<br /><br />I can see how this would be very convenient for those who like to cook via  microwave, and need something gluten free in a hurry.  ..But for me, I much prefer Annie's brand (regular or "creamy deluxe"), if I want boxed GF mac & cheese.<br /><br />Another option would be to buy "Riega (Gluten Free) Cheese Sauce Mix"- there's different flavors: Alfredo, Yellow or White Cheddar, or Pepper Jack. Add your choice of gluten free noodle.<br /><br />Personally, if I'm craving cheese and noodles I usually make a 2 person serving of Fettuccine Alfredo (old "Taste of Home" recipe), with "A Taste of Thai" wide) noodles, to share with another family member.  Or if it's just myself- fast and simple version: grated parmesan cheese, TBSP of butter, splash of cream or half & half, a little ground nutmeg & black pepper/salt.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one. I saw this one was cheaper so I gave it a try, and I couldn't readily notice any difference. I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two.

review/text: Several years ago a friend and I had lunch in a Thai restaurant. It was my first introduction to the cuisine, which I loved. One of the things I greatly indulged in however, was the iced tea. (partly because it was tasty and unusual, partly because I'd gotten my Pad Thai extra spicy!)<br /><br />I'm a bit of a tea snob, I don't do lipton, I like to fresh brew loose leaf estate teas, etc....and have hunted for that particular "blend" if tea from the thai restaurant for years. When I got this package I was skeptical, it looked suspiciously like nasty instant tea. I brewed it up however and to my delight, found it WAS the excellent ceylon black tea blended with a delightful mix of spices that give it a sweet tang that is wonderful to drink hot or cold. (tip, stew an apple in it with a little honey, oh my.)<br /><br />You will find some "sludge" at the bottom of the pan after brewing, as delightful as the brewed liquid is, avoid the tea fannings sludge, it's a bit gritty. Otherwise, this is that wonderful tea they serve in the restaurants. They often serve it as a dessert with cream or sweetened evaporated milk added, though I personally enjoy it just iced.

review/text: This tea is just like you will find at the Thai restaurant. I find it best to brew in the coffee maker, making it very strong and adding water to it later. I use about one cup of loose tea to 8 cups of water in the coffe machine. When it's all brewed and hot, I add the sugar, more water and keep it in the fridge. I add evaporated milk as needed, per each glass. It's a wonderful drink for a summer day!

review/summary: Good tea, lousy price
review/text: I bought this as well as the Pantainorasingh Thai Tea Mix on a quest to save money by making the things I like at home.  This tea is very close to what I've gotten in Thai restaurants, but the price is outrageous...especially after shipping.  I bought these two teas before venturing to my local Asian food market - stupid, I know.  But when I got to the market, I found the price on thai mixes to be between $2.50-$4.  So it's not even the shipping that makes the price high.  It's good, but not enough to warrant paying the extra cost.<br /><br />And if you're looking to make Thai Iced Tea, don't follow the recipe on the label.  I found a recipe online that works out very well - 6 cups water, 1 cup sugar (or splenda), 1 cup tea.

review/text: I ordered four bags of Por Kwan Thai Iced Tea Mix and they shipped quickly. I was unsure what to expect since I have never made Thai tea before, but when it says "tea mix" it is not in individual bags, nor is it dissolving tea mix, but is loose tea with a texture similar to coffee grounds. They even included brief instructions on preparing Thai Iced Tea on the stove, how much sugar and milk to add, etc. I was happy to discover after doing some googleing though that the tea is easily brewed using a coffee maker and coffee filter instead of the traditional method which requires a fabric tea bag thing that I don't have. I highly recommend this product and am excited to find it on Amazon after several unsuccessful trips to Asian food stores in search of Thai Tea.

This one is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />Amazing taste and extremely easy to make.

review/summary: Por Kwan Thai Tea mix
review/text: This mix, is a blend of leaves that are really fine, we made it in the coffee maker. I did purchase the cloth strainer, but that should be used for large amounts of tea. The coffee maker did just fine, make sure you don't use too much mix though, it's concentrated stronger than coffee is, so please take note of the instructions when it comes to measurement.<br /><br />It tastes delicious, just like I like it. I did not have condensed milk though, so I had to use regular milk. I will admit you definitely need the condensed milk if you want it to be like the restaurant's style. But it had the same flavors, the regular milk tended to water it down a bit.<br />I sweetened it with normal sugar, everything was fine.<br /><br />This is a nice size bag, you should have enough for awhile with this one. I recommend this if you love Thai Tea like I do..

review/text: This tea is very tasty. It doesn't have the unappealing fresh paint smell that some other Thai tea mixes have. I'm very pleased with it. I agree with the other reviewer that the price is high for shipping. In my area I could not find it in the Asian stores so I have to order it. For three bags the shipping was just $1.50 more than the shipping for one bag so I bought three to offset the shipping cost. I also agree with one of the other reviewers that the tea should be brewed very strongly then add water or milk to it later. I love the tea hot or cold with or without cream. The lovely orange color shows up better when you use cream or milk and the color is part of the charm of the drink.

review/text: I'm crazy for Thai Iced Tea, somehow my boyfriend's affinity for Malaysian food has let me this amazing drink, now I can make it at home, my joy is hard to describe. This tastes just like the tea I used to order, the sweet, date like taste of milky, caramel-y creaminess is best drank cold, this mix is insanely easy to use and believe me, tastes like the real thing. There's something alluring to this slightly harvest-spice like drink that is creamy and cool at the same time, it's like visiting India and Antarctica at the same time. It might sound strange but I promise it's easy to drink, in fact too easy, I can drink it all day.<br /><br />The tea comes in a large bag, looks just like the one pictured, inside is the loose twig like tea with small dried leaves with lemongrass pieces and spices. I heat it up in a stainless steel pot on the stove, one cup of cold water per one heaping teaspoon of tea. Boil 5 minutes, then strain through a paper towel lined mesh sieve, then cool it in the fridge. Once cold, it should be sweetened, I add simple syrup since it dissolves faster than sugar ( boil equal amounts of sugar and water, then cool and use to sweeten anything) and mix well, then pour over ice and top with evaporated milk. I drink it though a straw, and even add bubbles ( tapioca pearls) for a bubble tea like drink. This is sooo tasty and really easy to make in large amounts that I see myself making one now, good thing I have a batch chilling in the fridge as I type.<br /><br />Great and refreshing drink that is simply addictive, but still good for you, hurray!<br />- Kasia S.

review/text: I've never been a big fan of thai tea, but my husband loves it, so I looked on Amazon for a thai tea I could make myself.  I've always found that if I make something myself, it's more enjoyable than when I buy it pre-made, and this tea is no exception.  I boiled it as directed and strained it through a coffee filter; the first time I made it I mixed it with sweetened condensed milk, which was very tasty.  I then tried it with soy milk and a little honey which I liked even better.  Added some boba that I also got on Amazon...Heaven.  The only beef I have is that it has food coloring, which I try to avoid in my diet.  I expected something more on the lines of whole leaves, but this was pretty powdery, which wasn't a problem, just not what I was visualizing.  Overall, I'm glad I purchased it; my husband loves it and I enjoy it a lot, too.  No more restaurant thai iced tea for me!

review/text: I don't know if this product tastes exactly like the thai tea in the restaurants, nor do I know if I'm brewing the tea exactly the way they do. But, it tastes very good, and I look forward to drinking it. It's a personal treat. It is best served with regular half and half. Not milk or fat free half and half. I brew it using my coffee maker. I put the filter paper, just as if I were about to brew some coffee. I use my judgement with the amount of tea to water ratio. And i can now visualize the amount I need for a specific strength. All in all, it's a good product. Only had a problem with the shipping. I live in NYC. And will perhaps search for this product in China town next time. But until then, I have two bags to keep me busy.

review/summary: Excellent - and MORE than just a tea!
review/text: I wrote a really good review on this item but amazon didn't publish it because it was too long.  So I have to shorten it up.  The tea has three ingredients:  Thai Black Tea, lemon grass, and Pandan leaves.  The Pandan leaves are responsible for the wonderful slightly cream aroma and taste that comes through the tea flavor.  Thai black tea is attributed to having anti-cancer benefits as well as the lemongrass.  Both score high on the anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-cancer list.  I have been feeling so much better and so energetic with this tea (and this brand by the way), that I highly recommend it.  I researched it and it probably has only 40-50 mgs. of caffeine per serving - but don't let that stop you.  There are no side effects for me, no headaches, no shakes, no indigestion, or acid reflux like I used to get with even the best coffees and american black teas.  This tea is awesome and as other reviewers have stated, it is the best!  It comes in a one lb. bag and it seems to last for over a month for one bag even if I use it every day or sometimes more than once a day!  Lots of stuff in that bag!<br /><br />I drink it without the cream and sometimes put soy milk in it but always I drink the tea with a little sugar and/or agave nectar.  I boil the tea for five minutes as instructed and then I put it through a french press.  I make one big rounded table spoon of tea and put it in the press and I can get two and a half very large cups of the tea, made strong and dark like the restaurants.  Sweetened to taste, it is amazing.  I'm energetic all day long and never get insomnia or tired.<br /><br />Good luck!  I got my item in just a few short days and the seller did a great job shipping it out.

review/text: I used to get this tea at Thai restaurants when they first appeared in the U.S., and at Asian groceries as well.  Then, for some reason, it became harder and harder to find it.  Thai teas just seemed to all be conventional teas.  This tea contains a blend of spices, but it is not Chai.  I myself like it as hot tea, and I like it without a mess of fattening condensed milk as well.<br /><br />This package will make hundreds of cups of tea, so you should put it in a series of air-tight containers after opening, so it is not exposed to the air and it doesn't go stale.

review/summary: liquid ambrosia  now available in a convenient to go cup
review/text: There are a few things that you'd assume you're flying blind with regarding internet shopping and one of them I would have guessed would have to be trying a beverage at a Thai restaurant, falling in love with the flavor, doing a random search to find it on Amazon and actually getting it one hundred percent right with the first order.<br /><br />This tea tastes exactly like what I experienced at a local Thai restaurant. I'm not used to boiling my tea which was recommended on the bag so for the first pot I tried the coffee machine brewing method; this resulted in a really weak brew. I then used the directions on the bag and boiled the leaves for five minutes. I didn't buy one of those muslin strainer bags, instead I used my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPN8TK">Adagio Teas 16-Ounce Ingenuitea Teapot</a> which did an excellent job of straining out any leaves or sediment.<br /><br />Trying to be calorie conscious, I did try to chintz out a bit and used some soy milk for the creamy part but it was sorely missing that caramel-like note and gorgeous amber color so the next glass was made with sweetened condensed milk instead which had it hitting all the right notes. I found that with the condensed milk I did not need to add additional sugar or sweeteners like I did with the soy milk so maybe the calories balance out in the end.<br /><br />Generally I'm a little sensitive to caffeine but I didn't have any issues at all with this tea. It does not state on the bag how many milligrams of caffeine are in each serving but so far so good with no jitters, headaches, etc. I am really looking forward to experimenting with a concentrate of this tea to make it into an ice cream this summer - yummmmmmm......<br /><br />Some reviews have said this tea is a little high priced here compared to local Asian markets but there aren't any of those markets around here so I just ordered a few bags which makes it reasonably price IMO, especially considering how much comes in each bag. Shipping was very quick from this seller - Import Food Thai Supermarket.<br /><br />Very pleased with this purchase and highly recommended!

review/summary: Great flavor, nice reusable box
review/text: I loved every flavor of tea in this assortment, except for the mango passionfruit. The green tea with jasmine, peach tea, and English breakfast were especially good. I re-used the box to store my other varieties bagged teas. It's also nice to bring the box out at a dinner party and let everyone select a bagged tea. The latch on my box broke after about a year of daily use, but I will probably re-order this item.

review/summary: box too large
review/text: I ordered this for my office as well. It was too large and overwhelming for the space I had planned to place it. It is a nice, elegant box. You won't be fooled that it cost a large amount of money but was fine for the cost. The selection of tea is nice and will meet a variety of tastes. I ended up taking the tea bags out and putting them in another container but would still use this as a nice display for guests at another time.

review/text: I thought people might be being fussy when talking about this packaging and how difficult it is, well i have to say i got these carrots..and the carrots are sweet and great, however not only is the portion very little as it is, so much gets stuck in the cracks and crevices that its unbelievable how much goes to waste! That's money down the drain Tyler??<br />I know this is Tyler Florence's baby and he with Michael Chiarello are my absolute favorite tv chefs but c'mon Tyler, who thought out this package design??  it's not the most functional..and at the end of the day people want to get the most out of their money and with so much of the product going to waste with this current design, it kind of overshadows the overall goodness of the product itself i think. The product itself is a real winner however all in all, don't want to take that away.

She loves the bright orange color and flavor Also, since carrots were listed by her pediatrician as one of the foods to not make yourself due to high nitrate levels, I feel good feeding these to her (the pediatrician did not know if organic counted or not and said to be on the safe side avoid making homemade baby food out of carrots, beets, collard greens, and spinach). I highly recommend!

I suspect a diet including kibble, "wet" food and occasional treats is ideal.

review/summary: VERY POPULAR IN OUR HOUSEHOLD AND VERY FRESH!
review/text: I research before I buy anything, and I mean anything.  I am picky and on a tight budget.  I appreciate others reviews as that helps me in making decisions.  I know pretty much what I am getting with few exceptions. Thanks to all of those who take time to give reviews.<br /><br /> I was a little hesitant to buy candy online without pinching them to see if fresh but all turned out well. They are fresh and delivered right to our door in two days with prime shipping.  The price was right too. Will order more as this order is going fast. My 84 year old mother loves her candy!<br /><br />Amazon and their Prime shipping has been such a blessing to us in our situation so I want to let everyone know about it that it might benefit. If you order almost everything online, like we do, Prime shipping  pays for itself many times over in a year.  No, amazon did not pay me to say that, in fact, I am sure they lose money on shipping to us!  Just don't know what we would have done without it. It is so nice to be able to order most everything from one site too. Keeps it so much easier and quicker. In 30 days I have ordered 68 things from Amazon, from powdered eggs to an electric snow shovel. There is not much they don't offer.

review/summary: Halloween Candy.. Received 3 Days Late
review/text: I know this isn't the product's fault, but someone has to hear about how my Halloween candy was backordered. Amazon decided to host a special price on this chocolate. I have no complaints about the quality or freshness of the candy. I DO however have a problem with the fact that Amazon backordered this product. There is no way that 3 bags of chocolate do me any good 3 days after Halloween. It wasn't until the day before Halloween that I received a notification that my candy wouldn't arrive on time. I had hoped to use Amazon for all my Halloween candy. I will never try this again. I ended up buying chocolate on my own to give the kids, and then took the chocolate I received from Amazon to work. I would've thought a refund, or some sort of coupon.. or something would've been received. Unfortunately, my plans for using online services for Halloween were foiled.

review/summary: A pleasant surprise
review/text: I don't need gluten-free pasta but I like trying new foods. I was pleasantly surprised with the ditalini in the 250 gr box (9 ozs). I like this small pasta to put in soups and sides. It is a beautiful yellow color and tastes great. I was also very happy that it comes packaged in a bag within a box.  That means no chance of little critters getting inside the inner sealed package, love that. Most pastas out there do not have pastas in a secondary plastic insert and I've had to throw boxes out b/c I didn't get to eat them b/4 the critters did! The expiration date on these is also great--Sept of 2012 and it is only February of 2011 as I type this. On the ingredient label I do not see any listing for the fiber content which I like to know b/c I'm on WW; but that's a small negative.  This is made in Italy which seems to me a place that knows their pasta.  All in all, a good find and I will share it with friends, celiac and non-celiac alike.

review/summary: Best gluten-free pasta on the market
review/text: I have several family members with celiac's so cooking for a large italian family gathering is a huge challenge if you want to keep your meals simple when pasta is a must have menu item.  I've tried all the brown rice based pasta brands with mixed results.  They are either cook up too gummy, release a lot of starch in the water while cooking, fall apart when mixing the cooked pasta with other ingredients or they do not make great left-overs the next day.  The Le Veneziane pasta is fantastic!  My very picky daughter didn't even realize she was eating gluten-free pasta (she always turned her nose up for the brown rice pasta).  This corn based pasta cooks, feels and taste like the "real" deal and my entire family now prefer this brand over all other wheat based or gluten-free pasta.

review/text: I first discovered this pasta at the NYC restaurant Nizza (if you're gluten-free, you NEED to check them out!). The first time I had this pasta, I was not on the gluten-free diet but I tried some of my Mom's dish (she has Celiac's). As someone who knows what the real thing tastes like, I was absolutely amazed that this pasta was gluten-free. I actually preferred this to regular pasta. It doesn't give you that heavy feeling after eating, and it's great with basically any recipe. I'm now eating gluten-free, and we order this by the case. Skip the other gluten-free pastas (that generally taste like cardboard) and try this, I promise you will be amazed!

review/text: There are a lot of foods I can't have - wheat is one of them. I have tried several different brands of gluten free pasta and while they were okay or good enough to eat none of them gave me the satisfaction that wheat pasta did. Until I tried this.<br /><br />This pasta acts like wheat pasta - cooks up very well and it is just as good the next day. Stays together - doesnt fall apart like some GF pastas and holds any type of sauce you put on it.<br /><br />However, if you make it too el dente the next day it will be a little harder and you wont be able to eat it cold (pasta salad) without reheating it with a little oil or butter.<br /><br />I didnt follow the instructions for cooking instead I cooked it this way:<br /><br />Bring water and salt to a boil - put the pasta in - and boil for one min. Cover and turn off - let sit in the hot water for 8 mins. (keep it covered)<br /><br />This worked great for me and comes out perfect each time. You can go up to 9 mins - but i wouldnt leave it too long unless you like pasta on the mushy side.<br /><br />I'm so happy I found this by mistake - I love this and its wonderful to be able to have a good wheat free pasta!

review/text: The La Veneciane fetuccine pasta is absolutely delicious.  I have tried many, many different types of gluten free pasta in the past, quinoa based, brown rice based (tinkada, trader joe's) and they all come out somewhat mushy and just don't entice me to eat them.  This pasta comes out in texture exactly as wheat versions.  The taste is delicious and you cannot tell that it is gluten free.  It is perfect with just plain olive oil or truffle oil and garlic and also adapts well with regular tomato based or pesto sauces.  Would highly, highly recommend this product to everyone, gluten free or not!  I will never buy gluten free pasta again, my search is over.

review/summary: Best Gluten-Free Pasta I Have Tried
review/text: Most of the time, going gluten-free because of a recent celiac diagnosis has been fairly easy to do. You just have to remember to be vigilant, ask a lot of questions and read all labels and ingredients lists. Realistically, who is going to actually MISS crappy fast food (most of which is loaded with gluten)?<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago after peppering my favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant with questions about their gluten-free preparation methods, I decided to roll the dice and order a gluten-free pasta dish.<br /><br />Wow. It was so good, with the taste and consistency of regular semolina pasta, that I was extremely nervous that I had blown it. Needless to say, I was wrong and felt fine after enjoying the meal.<br /><br />After trying countless gluten-free pasta types and brands: rice, buckwheat, quinoa, corn, etc. etc... Le Veneziane is absolutely hands down THE best gluten-free pasta out there period. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />The owner of the restaurant gave me some to take home and then the hunt was on to actually FIND some in a store. Then again, why bother when you can buy it by the case and get free 2-day shipping?

review/summary: A good Choice
review/text: When I'm drinking instant coffee, Taster's Choice has for years been my beverage of choice.  Coffee snobs may turn up their noses at instant coffee; and it's true that nothing beats a well-brewed cup of freshly made java.  But sometimes speed is of the essence and all you really need is a smooth, solid mug.  Of all the instant coffees I've tried, this one is the best.<br /><br />The coffee itself has a very nice, rich flavor.  It is instant coffee, so don't be expecting the greatest cup of Joe, but compared to other instant coffee brands Taster's Choice is by far the most appealing.  I take mine with a little bit of milk or half and half (whatever I've got in the fridge) because I tend to find the coffee a little bit too bitter when it's black.<br /><br />One change that I've noticed and disliked in the last few years has nothing to do with the coffee crystals but is in the container.  For years, this coffee was sold in a nicely shaped glass jar with a solid metal lid sealing in the flavor.  Nowadays Nescaf&eacute; distributes their coffee in a tall plastic container.  My objection to the change is not based on aesthetics (although the look and feel of the original is far preferable to the modern plastic abomination), but rather how fresh the product stays.<br /><br />In the glass container, I could have the coffee crystals sitting around for months and they would be just the same as they were when the jar was new.  But with the plastic container, I find that it simply doesn't do as good a job as the glass for keeping the crystals dry and fresh.  Very often, as the weeks and months go by, the crystals start getting damp and clumping together forcing me to break up large chunks of coffee crystal lumps, something which never occurred in the glass container.<br /><br />To solve this problem, I ended up finding an old Nescaf&eacute; Taster's Choice glass jar and simply reusing that one over and over again.  Every time I need a refill, I wash out the old jar and fill it with the coffee I bought in the plastic container.  I'd like to think that Nescaf&eacute; is still producing the glass jars somewhere, but if so I've haven't found them.<br /><br />For instant coffee that actually tastes like coffee, I've been happy with Taster's Choice.  It's not what I turn to when I want an absolutely fantastic tasting, 100% pure, guaranteed to knock your socks off and touch the face of God cup of coffee, but it is what I choose when I want something right now.

review/text: This REALLY is great coffee!  It's an instant, (so it's easy to make),<br />and freeze-dried, (superiour instant coffee).  But it TASTES so much<br />better than other freeze-dried coffees I've tried....even 100% Colum-<br />bian bean instant freeze-dried coffees!<br /><br />By mistake, I left a jar out on the counter all night.  I've been told that one must put ALL coffee in the refrigerator, or it will turn<br />rancid.  Well --even without additives or preservatives of any kind -- my jar of Taster's Choice was still good in the morning!<br /><br />It used to come in a glass jar....which I preferred.  However, the new<br />plastic jar has been improved since its introduction, and now is MUCH<br />easier to open and close!  (Thanks, Nestle....I was almost beginning to toy with the idea of getting a sledge hammer to open the first plastic<br />jar opening you introduced....thank goodness you've changed it!)<br /><br />Now, with an easy-open, easy-close jar, and wonderful, just-right coffee<br />within, (not too strong, not too weak)...you can get a perfect cup of<br />coffee in an instant -- with Taster's Choice instant!  It sure is MY choice!

review/summary: Great taste and value
review/text: I bought the three pack of big cans for a great price. It's good tasting stuff and a far better value than Starbucks Via.

review/summary: I grew up with Taster's Choice
review/text: My dad always drank Taster's Choice coffee. I don't remember my parents ever brewing coffee at all. When I became coffee drinking age, it quickly became my favorite too. There are no instant coffees that can come close.<br /><br />The only time I brew coffee is when I have picky guests over. I really don't understand why they think brewed coffee is better though.<br /><br />Now my grown kids drink Taster's Choice as well. I even converted a few of my patients when I worked in a sleep lab. In the morning after their sleep tests, I would share my Taster's Choice coffee with the ones that were accustomed to drinking coffee. Usually the response would be surprise and positive comments such as "This is GOOD"!<br /><br />The regular Taster's Choice is great, but I like the Colombian even better.

review/summary: Instant Coffees
review/text: I suppose we are all creatures of habit. Mine is coffee, lot's of it. I like a well made percolator coffee, but years ago I discovered Tasters Choice. It's my favorite instant, hands down. Just put a teaspoons-worth in a coffee cup of water and nuke it in the microwave for 1:45 (well, in MY micro, anyway). The coffee is strong for some tastes; do you like espresso? Well, not that strong but definitely potent. Amazon sells it at about the same price as the local stores and with free-shipping that's a real convenience. Love coffee? Looking for something new? Here you are.

review/summary: wow :)
review/text: ok, coffee snob here....i sample and brew all styles...french press, espresso, turkish/greek (fun to make!), Senseo, Melitta...actually i am without the usual american autodrip (which is fine).<br /><br />at work, a colleague told me her favorite coffee was TChoice...still we had a drip at school, so i simply rolled my eyes in private!<br /><br />well, she mentioned it again last week and i inquired about it and why she liked it SO much...she mentioned all the things i've read here, that it was freeze-dried (i remembered that from the commercials when i was a kid) and the better of 'instants'...<br /><br />having a mostly open mind i said YEAH i'll try it. as soon as i tasted i remembered i HAD tried it before...when i took a small jar when i hiked some of the Appalachian Trail in northern Georgia. it took me back! plus, it simply tasted rich and delicious. this is what counts!<br /><br />i still prefer the taste of Melitta. and we all know Dunkin Donuts coffee is perhaps the best coffee in the solar system (much better than Starbucks!). but this is my new go to coffee. i have to be careful! i now drink 3 instead of 2 cups a day!<br /><br />i admit, the red original roast is excellent and what reintroduced me to TChoice. but i prefer the two darker roasts.<br /><br />thanks Victory for the gift of Taster's Choice!

review/summary: For Instant Coffee #1
review/text: Tasters Choice is the best instant coffee I have ever tasted.  The price of the coffee is more expensive then other instant coffee, but for the taste, I would pay the difference.

review/summary: The best coffee -- period!
review/text: Nescafe Taster's Choice coffee is not merely the best instant coffee I've ever had, it's the best coffee of any kind -- period! It is smooth, flavorful, no bitter aftertaste. It tastes like you did brew a fresh pot of coffee, but most definitely better.<br /><br />The convenience and the price is just amazing. I'm considering converting my coffee maker into a vase! (I don't think I'll be needing it again.)

review/summary: MYSTERY COFFEE MARKETING
review/text: I AGREE WITH THE POSITIVE REVIEWS. But please do not confuse the TASTER'S CHOICE freeze-dried product (rivaling brewed coffee) with NESCAFE CLASSIC (horrible tasting). Hard to understand how both coffee products come from same company. VERY STRANGE.

review/summary: Bad Taste
review/text: It is not worth the money.It does have a terrible taste.I bought one so far and stopped buying it and threw the unused coffee in garbage. If you want a good tasting instant coffee try Nescafe Classic or Nescafe Gold, available everywhere on earth but parts of the US.
