review/summary: POTENT STUFF!!!
review/text: I first used this catnip when I found it at the dollar store. I was leary the cost being so cheap. My Cats LOVE IT.. They go nuts over it.<br />In fact I got my order of this today from Dogs Toys Inc. It came in a brown postal box tightly packed.<br />My cats could smell the catnip through the box from about 5ft away. I then had to literally fend them off all while opening the box and trying to dodge the claws and teeth.<br />After I gave them some, like the size of a penny or a dime, they were stoned. They then proceed to shred the box becuase it still had the scent on it..<br /><br />This stuff may be cheap, BUT OMG its STRONG. A little goes a long way....<br /><br />The shipment was ordered on Wed the 24th of August and arrived today August 29th, 26th and 27th was the weekend. It took 4 days.. FAST shipping..

review/summary: Deceived!
review/text: I purchased this product hoping for the Twisted variety of Ring-Pops that had been out a couple of years ago, like the ones shown in the product image, but when  the package arrived, it was just a box of regular Ring-Pops with one twisted flavor included - not what is described! Color me disappointed, because you can't find the Twisted ring-pop flavors around here anymore, now I'm stuck with something I could have purchased anywhere.

review/summary: May be a fine food, but my cat didn't care for it much
review/text: After my cat had a nasty UTI a few years ago, I decided to try putting him on Purina One's urinary tract health formula to see if it would keep him healthy in the future. It gave me peace of mind to be taking a proactive step to protect my cat's health. And it seemed like a fine food. But my cat was definitely unexcited about it. He tolerated it, but he clearly didn't relish it. He only ate it because that was all I gave him. Plus, I started hearing through the grapevine of cat owners that there were better products out there for urinary tract health.<br /><br />So, I asked my vet, and he recommended a high-end urinary tract health food that I decided to try, and my cat loved it. So it was bye-bye Purina One. I have nothing against Purina One - like I said, it seemed like a good quality product - but my cat just didn't "dig" it for some reason. Too bad, because the Purina One was a lot cheaper than what I give my cat now! Oh well...

review/summary: Kona Joe "Peaberry" coffee VERY STALE and BITTER
review/text: I purchased the Kona Joe "Peaberry " coffee in late December, 2009 as a Christmas gift for my husband who loves Peaberry coffee from Kona.  Upon opening the sealed bag of "Peaberry", the fragrance was stale, flat, and didn't smell fresh or anything like "Peaberry".  We brewed a pot of it and found it to be both stale and bitter in flavor.  It was so bad we didn't want to even finish the cup.  The inner sealed bag of this "Peaberry" coffee was UNLABELED???  The outer cloth bag which was removable was marked "Peaberry".  Were we given another coffee instead of what we ordered? We have not brewed any more of this awful stale, bitter coffee since.<br /><br />Very Disappointed

review/summary: For those  who like mild coffee
review/text: I have a Keurig in the office for guests (and myself) but I learned that most of my guests prefer a lighter roast than I do. After tasting the Veranda Blend, I found it was light, but very aromatic and you could still add sugar and cream and it was very similar to a good restaurant coffee. So when supplying choices of blends for guests, I'm including Veranda as a milder blend for those who don't like French Roast or Sumatra or other bold blends. I find that there is a bit of woodiness, but also a slight flavor of nuts and cocoa. It's a pleasant blend of coffee and a very good cup if you don't want something awfully strong. Some lighter roasts are acid to me, but this one seems to be balanced.

review/summary: Caffeine Kick Without the Stomach Burn
review/text: After trying this new roast at the store and loving it, I was thrilled when I was offered a free sample of the k-cups to try on my office machine.<br /><br />Same as the store brew, mellow taste (to me that means no burnt after taste) and a high caffeine hit.  I am not a coffee aficionado so I cannot tell you about the cocoa or toasted nutty flavors that they tout.  What I can say, is that if you are looking for a simple blend that will give you the morning or afternoon kick that you need without leaving an acid stomach burn, try this coffee.<br /><br />Yes, it is expensive as compared to brewing your own coffee from store bought beans in your Mr. Coffee, but that is the point.  You are brewing a fresh cup in the comfort of your own home without having to get out of your fuzzy slippers or in some cases, brushing your teeth.<br /><br />Treat yourself to a luxury and stop complaining.

review/summary: Best Coffee From Starbucks Yet, But, It Comes at a Price..
review/text: Brewed on the 10 oz. setting on my Keurig Platinum brewer, the first thing I noticed was the very nice, enticing aroma.  Could this possibly be the perfect K-cup?  I had to have a sip before I even sat down.  In that first sip I tasted some strength, some choclate and nutty overtones, followed by a smoothness I don't typically find in a Starbucks blend.<br /><br />For  the most part I don't drink Starbucks for several reasons.  First and foremost, they tend to over roast their beans and the result is an overly strong and somewhat bitter brew.  This Veranda Blend "Blond" brew isn't roasted so darkly and finally I can taste the real flavors in the coffee.  This coffee actually reminds me of what a good "Donut Shop" coffee used to taste like; before everything became darkly roasted.  But I stray...  The first sip as I said was very inviting with lots of interesting flavors and a lively yet balanced acidity.  As the coffee cooled in my cup the flavor changed a little.  It became more woodsy and earthy but with a bit more acidity.  Still a good cup that comes close to my favorite K-cup, Millstone's Fog Lifter.  Foglifter is a blend of both dark and light roasts in which the flavor doesn't change as the cup cools, the first sip is as good as the last.  The acidity is always balanced whereas with this Veranda Blend the acidity becomes slightly more pronouncd.<br /><br />I usually prefer a light to medium roast in the morning and throughout the day.  In the evening I like to relax with a darker roast or better yet with a real espresso (which sadly cannot be made in a Keurig).  My verdict for the Veranda Roast is that it will fill the bill for my everyday coffee if and when the Millstone Foglifter either isn't available at a reasonable price or is out of stock.<br /><br />The price you pay for this good Veranda Roast is, well, the price, and this is my reason for the deduction of a star.  Starbucks has long been priced higher than other coffees and the Veranda is no exception.  This is only a 16-count box which means we're paying right at a dollar a cup.  At the Keurig website I can buy Foglifter for around sixty-two cents per cup when it is in stock.  Am I being cheap?  Maybe.  I just don't find Starbucks to be worth the extra money just to have the brand name.

review/summary: Very Good Coffee But Somewhat Expensive - Recommended
review/text: This Starbucks "Veranda Blend Blonde" K-Cup makes a nicely smooth cup of coffee that tastes every bit as good as the in-store brew. I personally go for stronger and "bolder" coffee but most of the other coffee drinkers in my family prefer this over the much more affordable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Donut Shop K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> we typically drink.<br /><br />Recommended for the flavor (5 stars) but not at the retail price (3 stars).<br /><br />CFH

review/text: Starbucks must think their coffee is made of gold.  A much higher price, and only 16 in a box.  While I agree with most others here, the taste is very good, but not worth the money.  If you want Starbucks Blonde, buy a bag and get one of the ecobrew cups and make it that way.<br />Update:  I went and kept track of the number of cups I could get from a bag, and you can easily get 25 cups from one bag which costs about half of what these k-cups do.  I won't post prices, but you can do the math.

review/summary: A Treat in a Brown Box...
review/text: First and foremost, having enjoyed the 'Blonde' variety of Starbucks since it's conception, it's pointless for me to tell you that I buy this product religiously and think it to be the best coffee on the market today.  What I can tell you is about the packaging for the 54-count package and my experience with K-Cups, in general.<br /><br />If you opt to go with the higher count package, please note that it does *not* come in retail box packaging.  Sure, the K-Cups are the same but, you get a brown box versus several 'retail' packages.  This, to me, isn't a big deal in the least.  It's not a large box and I'd rather recycle one box than several smaller ones.  My point - if this is an issue to you, buy in a different quantity.  Secondly, the K-Cup patent is a great one but, unfortunately for Keurig, it's days are numbered.  While I've tried to grind my own beans and use a ECOBREW reusable K-Cup filter to get the same results as the Veranda Blend K-Cup, I've been unsuccessful in getting it 'how I want it'.  As such, I've continued to pay a higher price per cup of coffee but, in the end, I still think it to be worth it -- it's a very unique blend.  What I can assure you is that the prices per cup will likely fall off upon the expiration of the K-Cup patent.  For that, I'll keep my wallet handy for these until they hopefully fall off in price due to competition in the near future.<br /><br />A+ service by Amazon, as usual, with PRIME!

review/text: I usually brew a Lg setting cup and the first time I tried Veranda, it tasted like a coffee flavored Chai. Extremely weak coffee. For people who don't enjoy coffee. And of course, WAY over priced. Why is starbux almost 5 dollars more than all the other brands? In this economy? Guess he really needs the cash to fund more illegal settlements. The weakest coffee I've ever had. Horrible.<br /><br />Whats more? Theres a starbax on a corner not far from my house (go figure)...and it's amusing to see the lemmings line up around the building to pay $5 for a cup of coffee, when 3 blocks over is a small mom & pop Cuban grocery (family owned) that makes the best Cuban coffee this side of the everglades, made fresh to order. Not a soul in the parking lot, I jump out ask for a grande con leche with sugar. It's 16Oz. for $1, and not a penny goes to fund any illegal settlements in Palestine.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: These Elk Splits are the perfect chew for any dog. They have no discernible odor to humans, yet my dog knew exactly what to do with it. Unlike commercially sold bones, this has no grease to mess up carpets or flooring. It does not splinter, so it is good for small or large dogs. These come not split for larger dogs, but I have found that the split antlers are best for my 20 pound puppy. He got his first split antler when he was only 5 pounds, and knew what to do with it, and loved it. Helped through the teething stage. Bought one for every room, and when he went after something, or me, to chew on, I would distract him with his antler. It worked! These are supposedly humanely "found" as deer and elk shed their antlers every year. I hope this is true, as you can't believe everything you read on the internet, but it does make sense! As they can make money doing nothing but finding cutting, and bagging these to sell. They aren't cheap, but they do last a long time. After the marrow has been chewed out, the antler can still be gnawed on, and will harmlessly flake off, and like bone, can be eaten. When the antler gets smaller, it should be replaced with a new one, as it could be swallowed whole in a smaller size. These have lasted for weeks! So the expense in my mind is well worth it. They do sell it by the weight of the dog, but use your common sense. A smaller one is not going to be any softer, than a larger one. The larger one will last longer than a smaller one, as long as it is not so large that the dog can't pick it up and carry it around. Hope these are around for a very long time.

I love mixing a scoop of this into my yogurt and will often add my own fruit. We cannot find this cereal in my area any longer so I am thankful to find it here.<br />Five boxes is a lot, but I will share this with my friends who also love it.

review/text: I eat a lot of granola cereal. This is one of the better ones. i like having it delivered, but I'm not sure that I'm saving any money. Now with having to pay sales tax in Texas, it will not be worth it.  But, it is very tasty.  4 stars because of cost, not quality

review/summary: Kellogg'g Low Fat Granola with Raisins
review/text: This particular cereal has been a favaorite of mine for about the last ten years.  Because local grocery stores ceased carrying this item, I had to look for alternate ways of buying it.  Fortunately Amazon carries Kellogg's Low Fat Granola with Raisins and Kellogg's Mueslix (which is no longer sold locally either).  Because my two favorite cereals cannot be purchased locally any more, I am thankful that Amazon carries both products and I can get my favorite morning breakfast fix without worry.

review/summary: Good cereal.
review/text: As everyone has said, this cereal seems to be served primarily at mid-tier chains-- Hilton and Marriott branches. I've never seen it in stores, at least not in my area.<br /><br />Anyway, it's as good as any prepackaged cereal I've had, and better than some; sweet enough to satisfy those morning cravings, but not a sans-sustenance vehicle for sugar like so many others. You'll want to remember, however, that "low-fat" does NOT mean "low-calorie" -- a single 2/3 cup serving has 230 of them, higher than just about any boxed cereal I have in my cabinet. Still, it does its job of keeping you full most nicely; you won't be hungry later.<br /><br />Add to yogurt if you wish-- it keeps its nice crispy crunch and has a flavour far more sapid than pre-packaged yogurt/granola blends.<br /><br />Quick tip: if you've never ordered perishable goods on Ammy before, Super Saver is plenty fast enough for this item. My surviving boxes aren't set to expire until early next year.

(Thanks Tony)<br />Since we can't find this in any store in our area we have it delivered to our door step. 5 boxes delivered every other month and give away one of those to someone else we got hooked on it. It comes in heavy shrink wrap so no worry about varment getting into it.<br />Breakfast or late night snack, instead of milk I mix it with lowfat yogurt and an extra hand full of Craisins. It doesn't get soggy and taste like a super crunchy rice crispy treat.

review/text: We had it on bibb lettuce with grape cherry tomatoes. It needed no sauce or adornment. I had seen a recipe that had called for it. It was good, but I don't think that we were any more enthralled with it than we would have been with an Italian tuna packed in olive oil. This would have been close to 1/3 the price of the belly tuna. It was a noble experiment but we woldn't be likely to do it again.

review/text: Overall, the kit was great and easy to use.  Would have rated it 5 stars except for the casings.  They were very small and almost not useable.  Fortunately, I had other casings and some collagen casings that I was able to use.  The sweet and spicy were good but I like even "more heat" in snack sticks.  The hickory were very good but if I used this kit again, would add more pepper and garlic powder.  Like about a tsp of each.  Depending on the type of meat you use, you need to add some binder like about 2/3 cup of soy protein powder for a 7.5 lb batch (available at Trader Joes).  Definitely would recommend this kit.

review/text: There was much to read as to labels and ingredients of this sausage kit. We were disappointed to find MSG in the Italian sausage mix or else this would have received five stars. Before buying this product I read all I could find on what was in these packages without success. The casings and the instructions for the casings were easy to understand. They were easy to install on the sausage tube of the grinder. But the Italian sausage mix has MSG.

I used to use larger ones that held 3 lbs of meat, but prefer these smaller ones because they fit slightly less than a pound each and you can experiment with smaller amounts of sausage at a time.  Made 20 sausages at this point, with only one casing ever breaking on me (though I admit I may have stuffed it too tightly). I'll definitely buy again.

review/text: While traveling in England I became acquainted with Typhoo Tea.  It has a wonderful robust flavor and is very refreshing.  I drink at least 6-10 cups of tea a day and alternate between Typhoo and Yorkshire Red.  They both take cream & sweetener well without any loss of flavor.  The two are different but in good ways.  I always try other black teas as well but am never without Typhoo & Yorkshire.  In England you can find them in any corner grocery (like Lipton here) and they are not at all expensive. If you love black tea, Typhoo will not disappoint you!

By the third and fourth and subsequent offerings, the hesitation stopped. Though the girls genuinely like these treats now, there isn't the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries.<br /><br />I like that the first ingredient of these snacks is  "real"beef ( not the undesirable artificial beef),and they are made with natural ingredients. The treats are small and chewy and are good for training, rewarding, and bribing. For most dogs the consistency is probably perfect, just enough chew to add interest. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left.<br /><br />Science Diet backs these treats with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

review/text: This stuff is REAL! You can tell when you first drink it that it's not diluted. Taste delicious if you like real fruit juice instead of artificial flavors. I'm glad that it comes in a glass container so that you don't have to worry about the plastic taste leaching out into it.

review/summary: Seems to work wonders for Gout
review/text: I have no idea how or why it works, but we decided to try it for my husband's gout after research on the internet, and since my husband started taking a glass of this a day he has had no further gout attacks - it even worked to curtail a gout attack the first time he took it. It arrives really quickly and well packaged from the seller.

review/summary: Refreshing, the Best!
review/text: This juice is rich, tasty with full-bodied taste.  I use it to make fruit juice shakes and in my protein shakes.  The reason why I ordered the juice is because I read that cherry juice is great for inflammation.  Prior, to drinking it I suffered from stiffiness and tenderness in my tendons and knees.  It has alleviated the stiffness and my flexibility is improving tremendously.

review/summary: Lakewood PURE black Cherry Juice/the ONLY juice!
review/text: Most juices tend to have a bitter taste when they are pure like this, and this is the sweetest, BEST cherry juice...EVER.  We are thrilled!  My husband does not like to drink any kind of fruit or vegetable juice....and he gets GOUT...which this helps tremendously.  Not only has he NOT had any flair ups since drinking this juice, he LOOKS FORWARD to having it!  He's tried many others and it's always a chore to have to drink....but this juice he LOVES!  Thank you Lakewood for making this task turn into a pleasure with your juice!

review/text: I started ordering and drinking Lakewood Pure Black Cherry juice in December 2011.I tried several different cherry juice brands but found this product to be reasonably priced, effective and very tasty.<br />I have ordered this product on multiple occassions in 6 qt quanities and the deliveries have always been very quick with Amazon Prime. None of the bottles has ever been damaged in shipping.<br />I drink this daily to battle gout and it does seem to be effective in helping to control or eliminate gout. I am a believer and would highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Wonderful Pure Cherry Juice
review/text: It is hard to find pure black cherry juice.  If you made your own, it would cost 3 times as much considering the price of black cherries.  This juice is great with no additives.  I have had several back surgeries and have developed minor arthritis in my back and neck.  I have read several studies where pure cherry juice helps with gout and arthritis.  I have been drinking this for a week now and the stiffness in my back when I get up in the mornings is nearly gone.  Don't know whether it's all in my head or actually working, but I will keep drinking this juice because it tastes great -- especially when mixed with a combination of other juices.

It is also NOT organic,which is about $14.00 more. As it is this is a fine tart juice and being pure is full of antioxidants and anti- inflamationary properties and great for mixing with any of the other juices(red)from the fine Lakewood line.This or organic?Your move.

Save your money though.....this isn't worth it.

They are irresistible without doubt and make a super snack.  Just don't overeat.

review/text: I haven't really found any of the Crunchies that I don't like, although I haven't tried the savory ones. The only thing I wanted to add about this mix is that you will spend a lot of time picking seeds out of your teeth. The raspberries and strawberries are the worst when it comes to this, but they're also some of the tastiest pieces in the bag! It's not the Crunchies' fault though, but that's the only reason I can't give this mix 5 full stars.
