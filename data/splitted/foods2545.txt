review/summary: Chalky Chocolate Truffle
review/text: I purchased the product for a Christmas gift and assumed that coming from Bellagio it would be perfect.  The person I gave it to tried one packet and gave the rest away.  She said it smelled great but tasted chalky and wouldn't drink any more of it.

review/summary: I got the 2-lb Bellagio Chocolate Truffle!
review/text: Hey, every culture has their ideal preference in cocoa. Look at the humble Nestle Milo or even Ovaltine---every nation has variations. Made in Singapore or anywhere in Asia is sweeter than their Latino counterpart. Mexicans or Colombians like that strong cocoa taste.<br /><br />Ive also tried Neuhaus, Chirardelli and other store brands, but I prefer Bellagio because there's no need to mix in milk for that smooth Belgian taste.<br /><br />Belgium or European chocolates are different from America's Hersheys brand. Their chocolate mix is not overpowering.<br /><br />Bellagio Chocolate Truffle reminds me of Starbuck's Signature chocolate drink with less calories (thhe company phased out this brand because of high caloric content -- 700 calories for the venti)<br /><br />So if you're on the go or a busy mom like me, Bellagio choco is the best comfort drink this cold season.

review/summary: My favorite hot chocolate.  5 stars
review/text: I keep trying to find a hot chocolate I like better, but I haven't found one yet.  Traditionally, I am dark chocolate fan but this is an excellent, rich chocolate drink.  It is also my mother's favorite and she is very direct with her hints that it's time for me to send her some when her stock gets low.<br /><br />I read a review that someone thought the Bellagio brand had a chemical taste.  The reviewer might have been referring to other flavors.  There is a different taste that seems perhaps spicey, but not chemical.  I also like the fact that it contains non-dairy creamer because I do not drink milk.

review/text: I use hot chocolate packets to stir into my coffee.  I normally use Land O'Lakes hot chocolate, but I've had trouble getting some of my favorite flavors, so I wanted to try something new.  I ordered the Bellagio Chocolate Truffle flavor, and I suppose that it gets the job done.  But to make my coffee taste chocolatey enough, I've been having to mix in the Bellagio cocoa with a K-cup hot chocolate.  The flavor's a little flat, and the texture is pretty watery when compared to Land O'Lakes or even regular Swiss Miss.  I don't hate it, but there are better options out there, so I won't be ordering it again.

review/text: Every year for Christmas I have given my boyfriend different gourmet brands of hot chocolate as stocking stuffers. However three years ago I got Bellagio hot chocolate and that is the ONLY brand he wants. He especially loves the caramel praline and the chocolate truffle. They are smooth and wonderful in warm/hot milk! It's never an over whelming or under whelming flavor. Always delicious. Whether you are sipping it reading a book or having it with friends after a great meal. I highly recommend it!!!

review/summary: Food or a chemistry lab?
review/text: What offends me most about this product isn't just the ingredient list that sounds like it comes straight from a mad scientist and takes a lot of reading to even reach anything that sounds remotely like food: I've come to expect that from today's mass market food. What offends me is the blatant misleading marketing. Not only does the package look fancy and have a fancy name, and not only does it say "A European Classic" (this is an American product), and not only does it say "Gourmet Hot Cocoa" (because at an expensive restaurant I always ask the chef for "corn syrup solids"), but worst of all "Savor the flavor of old world style chocolate": because I'm sure in the old world they mixed a nice helping of partially hydrogenated soybean oil and silicon dioxide into their hot chocolate.<br /><br />Someone gave me a package of this stuff and I'm debating whether or not to eat it, so I can't comment on the taste. But the misleading advertising alone, combined with this chemistry lab of ingredients, deserves one star no matter how it tastes.

review/summary: Great flavor, nice and sweet
review/text: We bought this using Subscribe & Save to try out the program, and we are very satisfied with the product AND S&S. This cereal is a great low calorie option that tastes probably twice as good as regular Special K. My husband and I happen to like regular Special K, but several of our friends think it tastes like "air" or "cardboard." I recommended the Multigrain Oats and Honey to them as an alternative, and everyone seems to like it.<br /><br />One thing to note is that it's pretty sweet. I used to use sweetened almond or soy milk, but I highly recommend unsweetened almond milk. I also love to top smoothies with this cereal; as you make your smoothie, though, you might want to leave out any sweeteners like honey or sugar. I also often add a little extra spinach or kale when I'm doing this because the bitterness is counteracted by the sweetness of the cereal. Your mileage may vary, of course.

review/text: I'm a little obsessed with breakfast cereal, so when I saw this I had to pick it up and give it a try. Today I finally got around to it and I'm really impressed! I normally stay away from all things of this brand because they taste like soggy cardboard, but this was actually really good. It was just the right amount of sweet and grain, didn't go soggy in milk right away and left the milk tasting good as well. The only reason it didn't get five stars was because I think it could benefit from including raisins or some kind of dried fruit in it. I'll be having it several times a week for sure, working it into my rotation. Yummy!

review/text: I haver cereal every morning before going to work with lite vanilla soy milk. I usually prefer the plain Special K cereal but tried this one for the fiber. There isn't that much fiber - but better than the plain Special K so it's still a fiber upgrade if thats what you're going for.<br /><br />The cereal doesn't taste bad like the other reviewer says. If you're expecting something like Honey Nut Cheerios - then no, it is not that Honey-like nor as sweet. It tastes just like the other special K flakes but a littler nuttier because of the multigrain.

review/text: I picked this up (on sale at local store) for a trial, quick breakfast or snack. Usually I'll read the ingredients first. But i was in a rush. Besides, box says, "whole grain, good source of fiber, Oats & honey..."<br />But the taste? Awful (I know taste is subjective. Very sweet, but... not "honey" or even "natural" tasting. ugh.). So what else is listed in ingredients? all the grains, sugar (3rd after whole grain wheat & rice), salt (140mg/serving or 6% of RDA), "natural & artificial flavor", "malt flavoring", BHT (preservative), and a slew of added vitamins. I gave it "two stars" vs. "one" because it has some fiber ( 3GM or 10% RDA per serving) and the vitamins. Now I have find out which of the friendly animals or birds will eat this stuff- maybe the deer? hope it doesn't hurt them.

review/summary: The best cold brewed green tea I have tried so far
review/text: I recently got bored with Twinings and Celestial Seasoning cold brewed teas and started looking for something new. I'm so happy that I found Swirl on Amazon. The box you get with this purchase contains 6 zip bags(packs) with 10 tea bags in each pack: 3 packs are 'original flavor', one mango, one mint and one peach. It is good way to try all flavors -- then you can switch to the favorite, 1-flavor packs if you wish.<br />I usually prefer flavored cold teas, but 'original flavor' (=plain green tea) is surprisingly nice and mellow. Since I have 30 bags (3 packs) of this flavor, I plan give away some to friends to encourage them to try this delicious tea.<br />I enjoyed mango flavor that I tried next, but peach flavor that was next in line exceeded all expectations - perfect balance of tea and peach, rich but not overwhelming. This one will be my favorite...<br />Mint flavor can 'kill' green tea if overdone - Swirl version is quite mild, but still refreshing. Probably the best flavor during or after the exercise.<br />Please note that it is real green tea, so if you leave bag in the water for too long, bitter taste can develop. Manufacturer recommends drinking it within 4 hours and I must agree: I sipped the last drops of 'original flavor' 3 hours after brewing and it was still good, but you could taste some bitterness that was not there within the first hour. I guess it could be worse after one more hour. Of course you can remove the bag from the mug within the first hour, but it may be difficult in case of water bottle.

In fact I found cold brew tea more refreshing, and no sugar is needed to cover the bitter aftertaste, making this product a healthier option than some granule drink mix products.<br /><br />My favorite flavor is peach and mint. I will definitely buy those single flavor cases when they become available.

review/text: While searching for quality green tea products online, Swirl tea caught my attention with its all natural ingredients and easy brewing instructions. It turns out Swirl tea didn't disappoint! Not only it comes with a variety of flavors but the brewing process is effortless. Now I can either enjoy it at home or pack the brewed bottle on the go. Flavor-wise, all of them are great with the original being my favorite since I'm used to having green tea without other ingredients. Nonetheless, do not sorry about the added flavors like peach or mango. They're not overpowering at all. Again, this is a highly recommended product for tea lovers.

review/summary: A nice tea alternative
review/text: I purchased these as a change-up to our inventory of teas, coffees and cocoas my wife and I drink during the cold winter months.<br /><br />As for the cider k-cups themselves, I am pleased with them overall. As with some of the cocoa k-cups, the larger setting on the Keurig machine produces a more watery result but this doesn't seem to affect the hot cider flavor as much as it does the hot cocoa.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, I'd compare the largest setting flavor to a green tea. Light and not overpowering, but the flavor is there.<br />With the smaller Keurig settings, the cider has a more robust flavor and is perfect for being creative and mixing in other things. My personal favorite is a dash of cinnamon and a dribble of Irish wiskey.<br /><br />I'm giving this 4 stars because I think that these K-cup makers should be able to produce a K-cup that creates a consistent product at the larger Keurig settings, but I can't knock it too much because the lighter, more diluted tasing cider can be very enjoyable at times too.

I am allergic to milk and gluten intolerant. Pamela's products are dairy free when they are labeled that way. (Not everything is, so read the label.) It's so nice to have a treat to eat when everyone else is having brownies!

review/text: These brownies had an excellent texture and the taste was pretty good. I wouldn't say they are the best tasting brownies I've had but then I didn't have any oil other than olive oil on hand to try it. I purchased a few packs and plan to freeze them until I have need of them. They will be great for those days you have a chocolate craving but don't have any other chocolate on hand. They would also be great for traveling. They only require 2 tbsp of oil and 2 tbsp of water and a microwave safe bowl.

review/text: Had to share, I was running low on oil when the brownie craving hit, so I found a bottle of lemon infused olive oil hiding in my pantry and used it for the oil component. It was AWESOME!!! I may never make them plain again, I wonder if lemon or orange zest would do the same thing? I'll be experimenting! The basic mix is great, a wonderful way to satisfy a sweets craving without making a whole pan to tempt you. Better than any microwave brownie I remember, I agree with others that it make enough for two servings.

review/text: These little pouches of gluten-free brownie mix are a wonderful product. I think it is more like two servings, rather than one. It is so nice to have a GF treat that can be whipped up in just a couple of minutes in the microwave but tastes like you spent an hour in the kitchen. A lot of GF products have an odd texture, this does not (the same goes for Pamela's regular bake-in-the-oven GF brownie mix -- yum!). I always try to have gluten-free cupcakes or cookies stocked in my freezer to send with my kids for a treat at a birthday party or event when their friends are going to be enjoying desserts that they can't have. But sometimes I get caught without something in the freezer and this makes an excellent alternative. I highly recommend these small-serving brownie packs!

Very good combination. The box is listed at one serving and 220 calories. I noted a small amount of trans fat in the ingredients, if that bothers you any. These are quite delicious.

review/summary: Thick, Rich, Not Too Sweet
review/text: Ghirardelli's Chocolate Flavored sauce is a thick and rich chocolate sauce that uses cocoa and unsweetened chocolate for an intense taste.  While I love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032FS02">Fox's u-bet 22-Oz. Original Chocolate Syrup</a>, Ghirardelli's works better as an ice cream topping because it is thicker.  I also like that it is less sweet, so it's easier to make a rich but not overly sweet chocolate milk.  The taste is closer to hot fudge than most chocolate syrups.<br /><br />Ghirardelli also makes a Sweet Ground Chocolate and Cocoa syrup available in bulk (64 oz and up) that is more bittersweet.

review/text: I'm what you may call a cream soda buff.  I love it, it's always been my favorite flavor... and no soda will taste quite as good as the cane sugar varieties, but I'm sort of on a caloric budget, and cannot afford to go drinking all my calories.<br /><br />I love this stuff.  It's great, perhaps it's an aquired taste, but I've been drinking naturally diet sodas for over a year, and I was so excited to try the cream soda version.  I prefer it over all the other flavors (I haven't tried grape yet, that's my next priority).<br /><br />I tried a few other brands of stevia and xylitol flavored cream sodas and none of them match up to this one.  I say it's definitely worth a try.<br /><br />****UPDATE (8/8/2011)***  I'm irritated.  I'm not mad at the product, it's still delicious; but when I got the package I ordered from Amazon.com, it had been through a lot.  It was smashed on one side, and sure enough, 3 of the sodas were ruined, had exploded all over the other sodas, and many had been deformed due to some horrific accident.  Amazon... I have never had such a horrible problem from you before, but this is my first food purchase.  It makes me very unlikely to order another food ESPECIALLY beverage package again, and I'm a pretty frequent customer.  I wish you would make it right.  I realize it may have been the mail carrier, but perhaps Amazon needs to package the beverages better or put a Fragile sign on it or something.  Just a suggestion.  Sad day for my delicious cream sodas.

review/text: Well, I have to say that I have been drinking this brand's sodas for a couple of years now, and I am always up for trying one of their new flavors. I liked the cola, the ginger ale is good too, and I really have enjoyed the Dr. Zevia enough to have it delivered in these cases for the past year or so. I recently tried the grape, and that was okay. HOWEVER, I AM TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY BY THIS NEW OFFERING. It didn't really hit me until I had my third or fourth can over the course of a couple of days, but I am really impressed. After you get used to it, THIS NEW CREAM SODA FROM ZEVIA HAS ME HOOKED. I strongly encourage potential customers to try a six pack, then buy a case. The only way good products like this one will be around is if we, as consumeers support it. What's not to like. It is a bit expensive, but I'm sure the price will come down the more stores pick it up and the more distribution of the product. Tell your friends. It's not only healthier than diet drinks, it is absolutely delicious!

It is so good that I haven't even missed my Dr. Pepper. If you like A & W Cream Soda, you'll like this.

review/text: I only drink Natural Sodas, mostly diet. Zevia is my favorite in the diet category and I find that their Cream Soda is a great alternative to the sugar packed or artificially sweetened options. It taste great over ice cream (natural sugar-free chocolate is my favorite with this soda) or on it's own straight out of the can. It's very refreshing and it's really nice to be able to indulge in a treat without undoing long hours at the gym or any of the other negative effects of consuming too much sugar.  I'm amazed at how they were able to capture the sweetness and creaminess without the sugar, calories or chemicals. After tasting it for the first time I thought I must be dreaming that something could be this good without any of the guilt. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I do!!!

I grow stevia in my garden so I'm familiar with the flavor, but I've never experienced it in the form of a drink, much less one of my favorites. I've only had it around for a couple of days and I'm already hooked! Zevia is exactly what I was looking for in a caffeinated beverage. It's not as cloyingly sweet as other cream sodas, and is refreshingly bubbly; To friends, I've described it as a drink between sparkling water and regular cream soda in terms of flavor and texture. I look forward to trying out the other flavors!

review/text: I love cream soda but can't find the diet version in any local stores. A&W diet Cream Soda was available for a while and it was good. I use Stevia as a sweetener all the time, so I thought Zevia diet CS would be good. Its absolutely terrible. It has a bitter, lingering aftertaste, and it tastes different than any other cream soda I have tried. I was excited about this purchase, but after one swig I realized it was bad. So now I have 23 cans that I can't return. I also ordered a case of a different brand which is yet to arrive. I'm hoping it will be better. It can't be any worse. I know people taste things differently, but for me, this was really bad. Be careful buying this stuff.

There is no expiration on the cans..they still fizzle..but the taste is definitely off...I question whther I should reorder or just purchase from the local market?<br /><br />Any one have any thoughts? Would be appreciated!

review/summary: Odd Man Out I Suppose!
review/text: I don't enjoy writing really critical reviews and I'll say in advance that Zevia makes other flavors I do enjoy.....but good god not this one. Zevia uses a combination of Stevia and Erythritol to mimic the taste of standard table sugar. It takes some getting used to but mostly works for the other flavors I've tried (the fruit flavored ones). The initial impact of this flavor for me is....eh, ok. Not bad. The aftertaste though, is absolutely heinous to me. It's especially terrible when not chilled. Obviously you should drink it chilled to begin with it, but you are completely out of luck if that happens to not be an option at a given time. I've read other reviews (here and elsewhere) that state its use as a mixer in other drinks as a compliment rather than standalone drink. This makes more sense to me as the aftertaste could be cut. Also, let's be honest, this stuff is pretty pricey-over a buck a piece when bought online and in bulk. Zevia is somewhat unique, mainly because of their sugar alternative combination, but there are similar types out there for less. I wouldn't hesitate to try their other products when all is said and done; this is just a miss for me.

review/summary: Real Cream Soda Taste
review/text: This is the best stuff.  I understand that not everyone has the same palette, but I just love this soda.  It actually has the flavor of Cream Soda.  2 of my 3 kids just love it.  The other one has that palette that tastes an after taste.  It is truly an individual palette thing.  I must say though this is the best No Sugar No Calories soda I've had.  Unlike a previous review, I looked at the ingredients and there is Carmel color, but at least it is listed as the last ingredient.  I just can't say enough good stuff.  I've ordered the Grape and hopefully it tasts just as wonderful as this.  I tried the Dr. Zevia but there is not even an essence of Dr anything...but still a good generic soda taste.  Hope this helps you decide.

I love the fact that is all natural, sugar free, and still tastes great. Sometimes I mix this with their Root Beer flavor which gives it a "creamy root beer" taste. =) I highly recommend this flavor if you're a cream soda fan, but don't want the calories of regular sodas.

I've never had cream soda, so I'm not comparing this to any other products.  I gave it 4 stars only because it's not a flavor I'd go out and buy on its own - I got it as part of a variety pack.

review/text: We have been drinking Zhena's teas now for several years, so obviously we are fond of them. Of the several flavors we have tried, the Coconut Chai stands out head and shoulders above the rest as our favorite. Now I should qualify my statement as we are lovers of nearly all things 'coconut' but that aside this tea is absolutely wonderful. We tend to choose it daily over other options in our tea selection. If you are a tea drinker and you are fond of coconut-try this tea, I am confidant you will not be disappointed. I have been buying it in cases of 6 canisters of 22 sachets for months now from Amazon and intend to continue buying it this way, as my local store charges more for it and don't always have it in stock. TRY THIS TEA SOON!

review/summary: Curious About the Expiry Date
review/text: Clearly I am a big fan of this tea, so I ordered a six pack! The idea was to have a continuous supply for the next few months, gift some and get a lower price per tin. However, surprisingly, the tea, in this particular order did not taste as wonderful as it usually does. Wondering why, I looked for the expiry date. On the box that they came in, it said, best by 2015. Which is great. However, under each tin, there a date stamped, which is February 2001.<br /><br />I am very confused. The date marked under the tins...are they expiry dates? They don't say so anywhere. And I know from my past experience of purchasing these (the black tea sampler tin for instance), that the bottom of the tin is where they put their expiry date. I am disappointed. After going through about half of the product (I am on my third pack), I don't know that they are returnable. I kept consuming them thinking, well, the next pack (tin of 22 sachets) will be different, better. They are not. I wonder what to do with the three unopened packs.

review/text: I bought a canister of this tea to try it.  I like most chais that I try, though most not nearly as much as masala chai in a good Indian restaurant.  I took several sips, but I couldn't finish the tea because I didn't like the taste.  I could not taste even a hint of coconut.  It's possible that the ginger and black pepper dominated, but I'm not a professional taster.  I like ginger in curries, but I'm not a fan of tea with a strong ginger taste.  I couldn't finish the cup of tea.

review/summary: A slice of heaven on earth!
review/text: First of all I have to say that I'm not a tea expert.  I've been a diet coke addict all of my adult life and two years ago I started drinking green tea for the health benefits and to reduce my diet coke intake.  During the summer, I discovered Chai cremas at the local coffee shop (oh, I don't drink coffee either) and really liked them so a few months ago I decided to try hot Chai.  I started drinking black Chai and then green Chai; I have graduated to such a large cup that now I can do a bag of each per 'cup'.  I quickly moved on to vanilla Chai.  I drank the normal store brands and then discovered Stash teas, which I really do like (although I don't think they make a black vanilla Chai w/caffeine).  This afternoon I ran to the grocery store and discovered this tea and picked up a canister...it was on sale for $5.87 at a large chain discount grocery store.  I brewed up a cup and added a little warm frothed vanilla almond milk (which is standard for me when drinking Chai).  Oh. My. Goodness.  SCORE!!  This is simply the most amazing black tea I've yet to drink!  The coconut flavor isn't overpowering and it meshes splendidly with the other flavors:  organic cinnamon, ginger, cardamom pods, whole cloves, orange peels, nutmeg, org. black pepper, organic cinnamon essential oil.  I don't add any sweetener, probably because the splash of vanilla almond milk makes it sweet enough for me.<br /><br />The price on Amazon is better than any I've found so I'm going to subscribe and save TODAY so I can SHARE with my friends. The canister is lovely (perfect for gifting), the little tea sachet is really cute (although there is no string) and the aroma is incredible!  Everyone deserves to indulge in this tea!  I believe this tea is organic.  The company is certified fair trade, they are environmentally conscious and a portion of their profits go to feed impoverished children...double SCORE!<br /><br />As a side note, I've been drinking several cups (4-6) of Chai daily for the past two months - w/caffeine in the morning and w/out caffeine at night.  My intake of Diet Coke has shrunk to one can a day (I used to drink at least 6).  Amazingly, in that time frame I have dropped six pounds...6 lbs!  I'm not a huge person either so dropping from 136 to 130 without changing anything but my daily intake of Chai is significant (to me).  Not sure if that's what is doing it (I haven't changed anything else) but I'll take that added benefit anyday!

I bought 2 boxes and maybe because I don't hang out with the healthiest folks, I couldn't even give them away.

review/summary: another great tea!
review/text: this tea surprised me its very smooth, and richer than other oolongs it almost looks like a black tea when brewed but its really really good, it really took a long time to find a decent tea company since the one I used to buy from went out of business, this is the best oolong I have had in ages, and you can never compare this to any crappy box tea so if thats what your used to this stuff will knock your socks off! its just good all around and yes slightly more pricey than your Se Chung say but this one would be a good morning tea.

review/summary: Not awful but not worth buying over other flavors
review/text: Not nearly as good as the cinnamon roll bars by Labrada.  Not awful but will not buy again.  There are far better protein bars out there that taste a lot better like Quest.

review/summary: Its a good bar but sweeter than the other favors
review/text: I've tried many of these bars which I really like since they have high protein content.  In general, the chocolate mint tastes good but seems a lot sweeter than the other ones like the cinnamon roll (which continues to be my favorite favor). These are great to have with you on the go just in case you are in a situation where you might miss a meal (I'm on Body for Life).

review/summary: protein bars
review/text: These are great tasting and provide the highest amount of protein than any bar I have tried.  They are not low in calorie so I would not recommend them for snacking.  They are great as a meal replacement as the product states.

review/text: This coconut pudding is a favorite in my family. I cannot find it in any of my local stores, I thought they had discontinued this flavor. I was thrilled to find it in the Amazon grocery store. This pudding is the best!

review/summary: Thanks Amazon
review/text: This is one of my favorite pudding flavors.  I use it in recipes and sometimes just eat it plain, but it is nearly impossible to find in local grocery stores.  Being able to buy it on Amazon just made my day!

review/text: I have my own dip business and it is hard to find certain jello flavors.  Luckily this doesn't seem to be an issue with Amazon!  Honestly, I hate coconut, but my customers rave about my dip so they must be doing something right!  Thank you for always having the ingredients I need to make my business successful!

review/text: I use this product, Instant Coconut Cream Pudding, for an original recipe and for some odd reason none of the groceries in Albuquerque carry this particular flavor of Jell-O pudding.....therefore I found it necessary to order it on line<br />As with all of the JELL-O products, the results are perfect every time.<br />It's good to know that you never have to worry about the quality of the products you are using and that the results are going to be perfect.

review/summary: The most wonderful pudding ever!
review/text: This pudding is great, and tough to find.  I buy it at a local country store and get it in bulk there.  I use it to make coconut cream pies and to eat as a sweet treat.  This price seems high, but if it is the only way for you to get it, I guess you will do what you have to do to buy it.  Amazon's price is cheaper then other online ways of buying it in box form.  There are ways to buy it in bulk as well, but those are priced by the pound.  My store sells it for 2.59/lb.  The cheapest I can find online is 3.57/lb plus shipping...good luck figuring out how many boxes a pound equals! (going by box size doesn't work unfortunately).  My best estimate is that there are between 3 and 4 boxes per lb. (a recipe calls for 2/3 of a cup to 2 cups milk and 2/3 of a cup weighs 4-5oz.<br />I hope this helps!
