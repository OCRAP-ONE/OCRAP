review/summary: Excellent sandwich cookie
review/text: Ok, for some of you (NAMELY Mr. A. H. of Detroit, Michigan), anything but a chocolate sandwich cookie, embossed with Nabisco symbols and filled with white creme is a travesty, but Golden Oreos are a worthy addition to the cookie line of Nabisco. These are vanilla cookies, slightly flavored with burnt sugar, filled with the familiar white creme.<br /><br />Unlike classic Oreos, the Golden version have not suffered much from having trans-fats removed. The cookie is still crisp enough and the flavor is the same. By contrast, original Oreos seem a bit softer due to the change in recipe.<br /><br />Another good feature is the fact that Golden Oreos don't leave a dark mess on your teeth. So you can eat one and not check yourself in a hand mirror afterwards if you are being in public. This is a very nice cookie with a cup of tea or coffee and a standard in our house for teatime or dessert.

review/summary: Americas favorite cookies indeed!
review/text: These packs didn't last very long in my home.  I found cookie wrappers everywhere.  I saw the box on the top shelf and thought they were still eating out of one box, Not!  The boxes were empty just sitting there all nice and neat.  I haven't ordered anymore.  I will make them wait a while, they was gone much too fast.<br />I guess I will break dowm and give them out for holloween.  I'll leave the empty boxes on the shelf too.) Ha ha.

review/text: I watch for this 48-pack of Oreos to drop below fifteen bucks to justify the convenience for the price.  With these small packs of Oreos my kiddos grab them for their lunches (1 is middle school, 1 is HS)and my husband and I also choose them for a small snack...a little indulgence!  I've ordered them 5 seperate times and they have always been fresh.  Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Hard to overdo it, with these prepacked snack packs
review/text: Each pack contains 6 Oreos.  That's a tidy size for someone who wants a little snack but tends to overdo it with a big bag of Oreos!  However, having 48 of these in the house has led all of us to a bit of Oreo gluttony.  You know how easy it is..."Oh, there's only 6, I'll have another pack."  As a result our box of 48 has barely lasted a month for three people.  So, I will probably not get this anymore because it's too tempting!

review/summary: Chocolate Cream Oreo Cookies 101
review/text: This is less of a review of the actual cookies; though I rated them 5 stars.  The real merit of this "review" is to provide  information that may help others avoid the confusion that I experienced when I received my order.<br /><br />I stumbled upon the product page on Amazon for "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream."  The Amazon product image clearly said "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream" and I had never seen that product description or package previously.  I had seen regular Chocolate Cream Oreos before and even original Double Stuf Oreos (with the white filling) in local grocery stores but never the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream.  I put my concern about the potential need to buy new pants aside and I ordered a case of 12 boxes, which is the minimum order.<br /><br />I received the case promptly from Amazon.  When I opened it, I found 12 boxes that simply said, "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  I uploaded a picture of what I received.  I called Amazon and told some nice representative in India that I received the familiar regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos that I have seen in stores and not the Double Stuf Chocolate Cream I had been expecting.  He apologized and shipped another case.<br /><br />I received another case today and it was the exact same product that I received a few days previously: "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  Instead of calling Amazon, I decided to call Nabisco (Kraft Foods, Inc.) for clarification.  The number is listed on the package 1800-622-4726.<br /><br />The following is probably the real virtue of this review.  I was told that the package now for the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream does not say "Double Stuf" anywhere.  As I mentioned, I uploaded an image of the Double Stuf product package that I received.  According to Kraft, the only way to tell is the UPC and package weight.  The package weight for Double Stuf Oreos is 1 pound 1 ounce.  The package weight for regular or normal stuf Oreos is apparently 15.6 oz.  The UPC for Double Stuf Oreos is 04472700.  The UPC for (regular stuf) Chocolate Cream Oreos is 044000025298.  Since the package does not say Double Stuf anymore, I am not even sure what my local grocery carries.  I need to check the package weight and UPC at the grocery store.<br /><br />Therefore before you jump, head-long, into buying 12 boxes of this magical Double Stuf Chocolate Cream, you may want to check what your local grocery store carries.  I really do not see the logic in having 2 different products with the same package, but there you go:  that is apparently the case with Double Stuf Chocolate Cream and regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos.  I will also mention that it would be interesting to see a side-by-side comparison of Double Stuf and regular Oreo cookies.  My guess is that the difference is not as significant as you might expect since I initially thought my cookies were regular stuf.

review/summary: not good
review/text: I'm the biggest Oreo cookie eater you'll ever find, so when I discovered they make sandwich cookies I was interested however the taste is significantly different from a regular cookie.  The icing is the same, but the cookie part is soft and mushy like a moonpie.  You can't really dip these in milk because they fall apart.  Not recommended for those who grew up with the dippable kind of Oreo cookies (that being most of us).

review/summary: keeps cookies tasting fresh and crunchy
review/text: These are always going to be more expensive than buying the single big pack - remember when oreos were packed into three plastic tubes in a plastic box.<br /><br />These oreos always come out crunchy with a very pliable filling that can be easily nudged-rolled off if you don't like the filling.  If Nabisco sold individually wrapped cookies, I'd pay the extra money as I usually only want one cookie.<br /><br />I will always choose to buy oreos packaged in as small a serving as possible despite the expense unless I get some kind of vacuum sealer.

review/summary: How can you not like Oreos, especially small packages
review/text: Great item at $16 (on sale).  My problem with supermarket packaging is the problem that the cookies taste great but once you open the package for about a week the cookies gets moist and taste not nearly as delicious as when the bag was open.  So these small packages, I think 6 cookies each is the perfect size.  They will all taste great and crisp.

They make a good snacking food in the afternoon or even in the morning. Just be warned, these things are filled with sugar. Each pack has 6 oreos, which I tihnk is too much for one serving. I usually split one pack for two days.

review/text: My review is for the product cookie itself, not what might happen if you buy food from Amazon. Oreo is a classic cookie, and while I can't say that I am a big fan of all their flavors, I really enjoy three flavors - original, Uh-Oh Oreos, and the top of the list, Mint Oreos. The flavor is strongly reminiscent of the Thin Mint cookies sold by the Girls Scouts. Unfortunately, they only sell their cookies once in a while, but I can head to my store any time I have a craving for the flavor of chocolate and mint in a cookie. I even like this better than original Oreo, and that's saying a lot. Nom nom.

review/summary: Chocolate covered Oreo recipe
review/text: Everyone loves Oreos. They're even better dipped in chocolate. I made a plate of them for my son's Cub Scout cookie auction and a plate of my cookies sold for $20. So yummy.<br /><br />RECIPE<br /><br />2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips<br />2 tablespoons shortening<br />1 package Oreos<br />*optional: 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon shortening<br /><br />**Before you begin, make sure everything is absolutely dry. Even a drop of water will ruin your creation.**<br /><br />Melt the chocolate chips with the shortening in the microwave for 1 minute. Stir until melted. If needed, heat another 10 seconds at a time until melted. Be careful not to burn the chocolate.<br /><br />Place one cookie in the chocolate and coat. Use a fork to scoop it out, tapping against the bowl and scraping the bottom of the fork on the bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place on wax paper and let it set. Store refrigerated.<br /><br />Optional: To make it pretty, melt a cup of white chocolate with a tablespoon of shortening at 70% in the microwave for 1 minute. Dip a fork in the white chocolate and let it drizzle from the fork onto the semi-sweet chocolate covered cookies. If done neatly, your cookies will look beautiful.<br /><br />Hint: I do one batch in semi-sweet chocolate and one batch in white chocolate. Then, I drizzle the cookies with the alternate chocolate. Plate them together for an eye catching presentation.

review/summary: Mmmmmm, vanilla-y goodness
review/text: I second Joanna Daneman's observation that these golden Oreos are preferable to the regular chocolate Oreos when you are in public.  Oh, how many times have I enjoyed an Oreo milkshake on a hot day, only to smile widely at everyone with a mess of chocolate cookie in my teeth?  *shudders*<br /><br />So, only downside to the Golden Oreos is that I don't think they'd be as good in a milkshake as regular Oreos.  But the pluses are many with the Golden Oreos... a crisp vanilla cookie that is very good all on its own, but sweet biscuits and gravy, the vanilla cookies are paired with a sweet filling.  They are addictive.<br /><br />If you like vanilla sandwich cookies, try the Golden Oreos!

review/text: It is hard to imagine something as good as the original chocolate oreo.  That was in the days when Oreo only meant one thing:  Two chocolate wafers and vanilla cream.  The best way to eat those was to soak them until they were soft in ice cold milk (only could get whole milk back then).  Now there are how many things with the oreo name? TOO many.<br /><br />But this! The Golden Oreo.  Truly wonderful.  Totally different than the original oreo.  But wonderful. It is also BETTER than the current chocolate Oreo.  I wish I could taste-test the original oreo for comparison, but cannot be done...

review/text: I have been drinking Bai for several months on a daily basis. When the blend is right it is great. However, earlier the producer's quality control was very far from good. Out of every box usually there were 1 or 2 bottles that were "off". They did not taste uniform and had unmacerated solid material floating in the bottle (I hope it was fruit). It was very unappetizing and just nasty looking. Lately the product appears to be much more uniform. I don't know if anyone else experienced this lack of quality control but it was bad!

review/summary: Awesome drink!
review/text: I tried this at Costco and immediately bought a case.  The Ipanema Pomegranate flavor was by far a huge winner for me.  I liked the peach too, but the strawberry was super-sweet and heavy on the Stevia taste.  The pomegranate, you can't even tell stevia is in it.  It tastes just like Pomegranate juice, with the same bite, but lighter and obviously you don't pay in the calorie department.  I am pre-diabetic and this is pretty good with only 10g of carbohydrates and 5 calories.  I generally stick with water, coffee or hot tea, but this is my guilt-free indulgence.  And it gives you energy too with the coffee fruit infusion.  I would have never bought it as I hate stevia aftertaste, but they got me with the samples booth.  I was very impressed.  Just make sure you get the red cap flavors if you are watching your weight/sugar.

I'm on weight watchers, so I'm "counting" everything that goes down the hatch, and this is the best mid morning and/or mid afternoon snack.

My two kids love the juice and as a parent, i'm very happy to give it to them. The most impressive thing is the Calorie content, most drinks in this calorie range come up short, not with Bai. It's full flavored and Very satisfying. Five stars.

review/summary: The Food Scientists Got Me On This One
review/text: I'm not big on food science. (Remember when eggs were bad for you? Now they're good for you? Or are they?) However, the one food claim I think will stick is that eats and drinks full of antioxidants are good for your health. All the proof I need is the 1982 Volkswagen Scirocco I owned in college. That sucker rusted so badly, it was leaking GAS by the time I had it towed away for good. Rust, of course, is caused by oxidation of iron (learned that in 10th grade chemistry), so I can only imagine the kind of stuff oxidation is doing to the pipes inside my body. So, I only have to believe that antioxidant rich foods do a little bit of good - any good, really - for me to load up on them. I can buy into that much food science.<br /><br />Anyway, the point of this ramble - I picked up a bottle of Bai because it seemed like a good way to sneak a ton of antioxidants into my diet. As it turned out, the stuff was damn tasty too. I've been drinking it for about a year now, and it seems to get better with each new flavor. I'm writing here because the pomegranate, which I believe only recently came out, has zoomed to the top of my list - so fast that I've actually stopped caring whether it's good for me and just enjoy drinking it ... which makes everything easier because, like I said, I'm not big on food science.

review/summary: My new favorite pomegranate!
review/text: Bai5 Ipanema Pomegranate is amazing. The flavor is delicious and really rich and flavorful for being low calorie- and with only 1g of sugar I don't think I'll ever go back to another pomegranate drink. I get the pomegranate flavor I love plus the antioxidants I need - thanks superfruit! :)

review/summary: POM IS THE BOMB!
review/text: bai5 ipanema pomegranate is hands down the best flavor of bai EVER (even though I probably say that about all of them!) But this one really takes the cake ... the coffee-super-fruitcake! Ipanema pomegranate has the perfect amount of big sweetness and bold tart flavor - without any of the big or bold calories. With only 10 cals in a bottle and 2 grams of sugar, its clearly the smartest choice out of all the pomegranate drinks on the market. Even with just a mere 5 calories per serving, ipamena pomegranate doesn't skimp on antioxidants (4,000 ORAC units per bottle!) or quality - the ingredients in every bottle are 100% natural, and naturally delicious.

review/summary: Weak, but tasty!
review/text: This product met my expectations very well.  The flavor wasn't quite what I expected, however.  I expected a cinnamon flavor with subtle hints of hazelnut and vanilla.  Instead, I found that all three flavors are pretty evenly distributed.  The end result is a cacophony of flavors which is very powerful and distracts from the natural coffee flavor.<br /><br />The beans themselves are rather small.  Because of this, I think, the coffee is rather weak.  I find myself having to use 30% more coffee per pot than with my traditional coffee beans.  The cup, when poured black, has a very weak color to it, if you add creamer the look is very reminiscent of tea with milk.<br /><br />When I first tried the coffee I was very unhappy with the results.  However, after tweaking the amount of grounds I use (as well as increasing the coarseness of my grounds) I found a product that was palatable.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Probably not.  However, I can see many people who dislike strong coffee truly enjoying this.

review/summary: Best Mix I've Ever Tried
review/text: Wick Fowler's 2 Alarm Chili Mix is the key ingredient in the Filet Mignon Chili Recipe from the Mark & Brian radio show (also known as FinnDog's Chili recipe).  My boyfriend couldn't stop talking about wanting to try that recipe, so of course I wound up ordering the chili mix and the rest is chili making history!  I didn't follow the steps on the box, I've been making the chili from the FinnDog recipe, which involves a bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale as a replacement for some of the liquid called for.  Even with that substitution, you get such an incrediblely flavorful, complex and spicy result, you know it's not just the beer!  I've made it with the aforementioned filet mignon, ground beef, kidney beans and various combinations and it's always an enticing, brick red pot of chili nirvana!  I'm keeping it in the pantry, it's become a staple around our place.

review/summary: Australian Candy Bars Are Da' Diggity Bomb!
review/text: This morning I was blessed to have my very first Tim Tam experience. An Australian colleague of mine, Tim, gave me a Tim Tam as a belated Christmas gift. He also provided detailed Tim Tam eating instructions. I have provided them below so you too can have an absolutely amazing Tim Tam experience.<br /><br />1. Prepare a warm cup of delicious hot chocolate/coffee/milk tea (I had coffee). 2. Open the Tim Tam pack and take it out. 3. Take a very small bite from one corner of the Tim Tam. 4. Rotate the Tim Tam and take another small bite from the corner diagonally opposite as shown: a picture was provided. 5. Insert one of the bitten corners into your drink and use the other end like a straw. Keep pulling until you feel liquid come up through the Tim Tam. The chocolate will keep the Tim Tam in shape, however depending on the temperature of your drink...you have 2-5 seconds before the chocolate melts and your Tim Tam falls into your drink (a tragic fail). Therefore, take a bite quickly as soon as you feel liquid arrive through the Tim Tam; enjoy.<br /><br />My only complaint about Tim Tams are they are too small. I'm thinkin' I could go through 25 of these guys right now. I highly recommend ordering you some Tim Tams. They are da' bomb!

review/text: I've lived and worked in Scotland, and sought a piece of it to chew on; one can't just imbibe peated malt. But these delicious oatcakes are a bit risky, like running about Scottish crags with a kilt and no unders. Tiny hard bits might impede your bite. Maybe sturdy extra-strong Scottish chompers can handle this. The oatcakes are delicious with wild honey, or unadorned in their simple goodness. Just be careful.<br /><br />Best accompanied by: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SINSYO">Hamish MacBeth: Series 1-3 Collection</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050N0US4">Vera</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003K025MI">A History of Scotland</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EYT8BA">Monarch of the Glen: Complete Collection</a>.

review/summary: So extremely mild-flavored as to be almost tasteless
review/text: It looks like those who have been to Scotland love this product. I came from a different POV: I was just curious what they taste like, and took advantage of last summer's 50% off deal to try some new-to-me products. And I love Walker shortbread.<br /><br />I first tried one straight. Very dry, and except for a little hint of salt, essentially tasteless. (Of course, cooked oatmeal is pretty tasteless until you add the butter and brown sugar!) Not awful, but kind of like eating cardboard. Then I tried a slice of Brie on an oatcake; again, not awful, but not as good as the Brie tasted by itself. I tried it with a little butter on it; same result. I wound up giving the rest of the package to my husband to eat; he routinely eats rice cakes so doesn't require his food to have flavor.<br /><br />I can't imagine wasting jam on these. It would be interesting to try in soup, when I find the other three packages, but even in soup I prefer flavorful crackers. (Town House is my favorite.)<br /><br />I can easily believe the other reviews who praised these as authentic and reminding them from Scotland. But lacking those positive memories myself, the best I can award them is "okay."

review/summary: Is this the most perfect food?
review/text: Well, probably not.  I can't remember if palm oil is OK or VERBOTEN. But here's how it's perfect:  oatmeal is so good and nourishing, and it goes with so many other good foods, that it seems the perfect food.  One time our dog was hit by a car, late on a Sunday afternoon.  We had to rush her to the emergency vet, 45 minutes from our house.  We put her in the car, loaded the car with oatcakes and poured some white wine.  Yes, we drove while drinking the wine, but we got there, etc., etc., and weren't starving when, hours later we got back home with our poor bandaged-up but surviving dog. Oatcakes are filling as well as delicious.  Oatcakes and orange juice seem to be a perfect breakfast, if you're on the road or taking to the air. For a plane trip, take oatcakes, cheese, maybe some thinly sliced ham, grapes, and your drink of choice.  And, as the package suggests, you can, for a party, top each biscuit with cream cheese and fruit -- the versatility is remarkable. And:  just remember:  oatmeal is remarkably nutritious.  Just think of all those race horses!

review/summary: Walker's Oatcakes
review/text: It was a pleasure to see this hard-to-find item offered by Amazon.  Oatcakes make an excellent addition to a light lunch.  We are unable to buy them locally; and are delighted to be able to secure them from Amazon.  While Walker's shortbread products are found on virtually all supermarket shelves, finding the unsweetened oatcakes is a much more challenging proposition.  I'm glad to have access to a dependable supply

review/text: I absolutely love these, but I could see how some people might not.  They sort of look like cardboard coasters and they're dry and crumbly.  I love how dense they are, though, and they have a good subtle flavor.  They also have no additives and are basically just oatmeal in cracker form.  I think they taste better plain than with toppings.  A traditional cracker tastes better when topped with cheese, etc.

(trying to eliminate refined carbohydrates from our diet and these oat crackers are so much more satisfying than a regular flour based cracker).  I'm hoping Walkers will continue to make these indefinitely!

review/summary: Back in Highland Heaven - just need a bowl of good Stovies
review/text: Ahhh nothing like Stovies and Oatcakes to get you rolling over the glen! These are just what I needed to compliment my canned Haggis from Caledonian Kitchens. Not exactly Scotland but hey, it's good! These oatcakes slightly warmed will make you feel all happy inside - maybe it's the Scot in me but even with some corned beef hash and warmed oatcakes I can ride out any bad weather or a bad day. Yep, these will do quite nicely and a whole lot cheaper than a plane ticket!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />In case you'd like some haggis - yes they have vegetarian.

review/text: These Payday Peanut Caramel candy bars were very yummy. I don't know why the first description of the product says 8 bars. A bit further down in the details it does tell you 18 bars. $17.51 for 8 candy bars would be a rip off. But you get 18 King Size candy bars, which equals 36 regular size. So the price, with the free s/h is a good deal. I would buy again.

review/text: This is a great candy bar for those who just can't get enough of having peanuts in their mouth.  When you peel back the wrapper you see a coating of peanuts, and once you take a bite you get a tasty peanut buttery treat in the center.  Held together with delicious caramel, you won't be able to get enough of this sweet, nutty masterpiece of snack craftsmanship.  It's not your run-of-the-mill chocolate-coated candy bar, but so much more.  It also has a salty taste, which gives makes it stand out.  For nut-lovers, it's nirvana.  For everyone else, it's just a darn fine snack.

review/text: If you are ordering you probably already  know what this is. I thought maybe because it had a lot of nuts it would be a healthier type of candy bar, but its not. aside from being pure sugary caramel, the nuts are salty. i dunno who would combine salted nuts with pure sugar like this, but it doesnt taste that great and makes me feel ill after eating it because its just not healthy ingredients. I read that they used to have a high protein version of this called payday pro, but i cant find that. dont think this is any healthier than your average candy bar like I did.

review/text: This granola is really yummy stuff!  The taste is fantastic, a nice vanilla flavor with a hint of apple and a lighter hint of blueberry.  It is healthy and most importantly for me, free of additives and preservatives!!  I love eating it as a cereal with milk, mixed in my yogurt, right out of the bag as a snack or I use as a topping for my apple crisp.  The price is reasonable for the quality and quantity and the nutritional value is good.  The only criticism I partially agreed with that I read from another reviewer was that it barely had a trace of blueberries in it, which I agree but hey - adding a handful of fresh berries (any kind) is pretty simple and delicious!

review/summary: The best granola!
review/text: I bought this for my son who has food allergies because all the ingredients were identified in the label, and it had none that he couldn't eat.  It has now become the favorite granola for my family.  I love the fact that it tastes so good, but has no fat.  Believe me, you won't miss it at all.  The same with the minimal sugar content.  It makes you wonder why all that other granola that is sold in boxes in the grocery store needs to have all those extraneous ingredients added you can't pronounce, or why they needs are so much more unhealthy in terms of added sugar and fat (and I am not talking about the fat that may come from nuts added to some granolas). This Bob's Red Mill granola is great straight, for baking, in yogurt, or with milk.

These make great gifts as well. I've gifted out a couple bags already. The price is unbeatable, plus the shipping time is prompt. They come to you packaged in a nice box. The granola itself is not too sweet, has a hint of vanilla flavor & slight blueberry. It is very good & this is a great place to order, especially the subscribe & save that delivers on schedule or earlier if you run low. I'm trying all the other flavors too, but this one is my favorite. Everyone I have given a bag to is hooked on it.

review/summary: Very tasty and a great breakfast/snack
review/text: I bought this on a whim after it made it to the Gold Box deals. I had seen the stuff before at Whole Foods and a few other places, but never really gave it any thought until i saw it here. I have been considering just how unhealthy my diet has become since moving back to Salt Lake City and reflecting upon my great physical condition prior to my move. Anyway, I've decided recently that there is no reason not to get back to that lifestyle and conditioning. A big part of that is what you eat and when. This item is a clear winner for getting back on track. It is very tasty, and while sweet, it is not too sweet. I particularly like the little bits of apple and blueberry, which is where the bulk of the sweetness comes from. Anyway, it makes a great and fulfilling breakfast for me, either by itself, or mixed with some yogurt. It also makes a great snack when you just need a little something, and is a great tide me over for just after a workout, but before you've had a chance to eat an actual meal (which i try to do about 45 minutes after a work out).<br />I'll buy this again.

review/text: This granola has great ingredients and is very tasty.  I need to let it soak in milk for about 5 minutes to make it less challenging to chew (very hard and cruncy, and I'm not all that old...).  The funny thing about this granola is that it must be VERY high in fiber, if you know what I mean, so I have to eat it at strategic times.

review/text: After visiting a nutritionist, they recommended that I eat foods that were high in fiber and low in sugar.  I like Granola, but found that most Granola offerings were very high in sugar content.<br /><br />After researching lots of options, I found Bob's Red Mill Granola to be the right balance of fiber and sugar.  This is the only flavor I have tried so far, but the Apple and Blueberry flavor is delicious.<br /><br />So far, I have eaten this granola plain, with milk and mixed with yogurt.  Like all granola, if this sits in liquid too long it gets very mushy.  I don't like mushy very much, so I eat quickly after adding to milk or yogurt.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased and will be trying other flavors soon.

You can smell the blueberries when you open the package and the blueberries are very noticeable. I have milk on mine and it actually turns blue from the berries. These packs are also resealable whereas the Red Mill are not. Probably won't be buying it again.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: This is the best oat bran cereal.  None of the others matches it.<br /><br /> It can be hard to track down and Amazon hasn't always carried it.  So I'm always so relieved when I see it here and buy a 6 mo stock.  Great to have it on Prime too.<br /><br />My 94 year old mother has been eating this for breakfast for oh, the last 30 years or so.  She started it when her doctor told her she had to reduce her cholesterol.  And she did.<br />It's been her daily breakfast ever since (w 1/2 banana sliced,  a sprinkling of wheat bran, and a tblspn of yogurt).<br /><br />It also makes The Best Muffins (add raisins) - they have a kind of creaminess because the bran is so smooth.  My mom baked those almost daily when she was working at getting the cholesterol down.  They're simple but yummy addictive - and good for you.<br /><br />I think her oat bran cereal combo breakfast has helped keep my mom alive and healthy all these years.  That plus her daily chocolate and sherry!
