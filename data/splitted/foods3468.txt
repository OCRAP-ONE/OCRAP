review/summary: It Seems That This is All My Dog Thinks About
review/text: I got this package of four back in April. The day that the package arrived, my springer spaniel was all revved up over something. I just wasn't sure what it was. These treats were in a box, shrink-wrapped within this box, and split into four packages. My dog paced and paced until I finally opened the box, and it turns out that she had still been able to smell these treats through the packaging. My three dogs are in love with these treats. My 14 year old springer nibbles at anything that comes in front of her (including my fingers) that looks like a little sausage because she is still so focused on these treats five months later. Bottom line, these treats will drive your dogs crazy, but in a good way.

review/text: My dogs are food hounds -- dachshunds -- they LOVE food.  But these little morsels drive them crazy.  Two of my dachshunds are experienced couch potatoes -- until they hear the sound of the bag being opened. Then you'll never see them run so fast.  Excellent product!

review/summary: My dog likes these best of all
review/text: My Mini Aussie does agility training one night a week.  Being that she is an Aussie I am luck to have such a smart dog that has no problems being trained.  However I am also cursed to have a stubborn dog who likes to do things at her own pace and when she feels like it.  The only thing that motivates her are treats, and some treats she likes more than others.<br /><br />The Nathan Hot Dog treats seem to be one of her favorites (believe me she has favorites).  She will always do what is asked for a treat of her favorite snacks from Nathan.  In fact Nathans is one of about 5 treats that we use that she will actually try and steal from our other dog.  Normally she will sit patiently for her treat but Nathans will usually get her to jump up and down.<br /><br />Needless to say we recommend Nathans!!!

review/summary: My dog loves them
review/text: I am actually subscribing to this item. It contains natural ingredients and my dog is crazy about them. They are really aromatic, whenever I handle them I have to resist an urge to taste one myself.<br /><br />I stuff them in my dog's treat ball every evening and she is very occupied until she gets the very last one out. I also put other treats in the ball, but if hot dogs are gone, she looses her interest.

review/summary: These contain corn syrup solids, dextrose & sugar! toxic to dogs!
review/text: If I could give these treats and a whole bunch of others 0 stars, I would.  They contain among their first ingredients corn syrup solids, then dextrose and a little bit farther down the list sugar.  Sugar and other forms of sugar like corn syrup and dextrose are linked to cancer in dogs.  They're just as bad if not worse for them  than for humans.  Sure the dogs love them; but there are a lot of healthy treats out there that are just as well liked.  You're buying the name brand, advertising and packaging.

review/summary: They have to be refrigerated???
review/text: My dogs love these and they seem like they are made out of quality ingredients from reading the package but it says in bold letters across the back, "Must Be Refrigerated After Opening". I don't know about you, but my dogs treats are kept in a certain area and they are not fed people food. Therefore, I feel it is sending the wrong message to be opening the fridge and giving my dogs a treat out of it since now they stand by the fridge expectantly everytime I open it and they are aware that that is where the people food is kept. It is very inconvenient to have to keep these in the fridge so I will not be purchasing them again. Also, the portion size is very small for the price.

review/text: UNBELEIVABLE! People are so gullible, no these treats aren't toxic to your dogs, but they certainley aren't healthy either.  Just because sugar and fat taste good doesn't mean you should feed it to your dog! Get a clue and check out the ingredients in the treats and food you feed your dog, and even though some things are healthy for humans doesn't mean they are for dogs (e.g. SOY AND CORN) try thinking for yourself and doing your own research. SEARCH DOG FOOD ADVISOR.

So, when we got home I looked it up on Amazon, in two days I had a whole package of 12, used a few of them to go with birthday gifts - great item for kids, great price and def love Amazon.

review/summary: Greatest little toy ever!
review/text: My son had to get three shots for school. Because there were so many I wanted to have something special for him when it was over. I ran to the little store near my house and the clerk showed me these. The rocketship one was perfect. I did open the candy part for him but he probably would have been happy without knowing. Now, he is in his bed pointing the laser light at the ceiling. He is also going through the "afraid of the dark" phase but requested that the nightlight not be turned on because it would interfere with the rocketship laser. Could I have killed two birds with one toy? Let's just hope.

She's a cat addict and the red face of the cat is illuminated onto anything - kinda reminds me of Batman.  She loves it!! (and still hasn't realized there is candy inside)  The neighbor's dog loves it too....he's chased it all over the house.  We brought it to school yesterday for show & tell and it caused a small riot - all the kids wanted to try it.  And, the cutest thing was that one of the boys made me "pinky swear" that I would bring him one tomorrow.<br /><br />Forget the $50 box toy....buy a laser pop for $1.59!!!

I can't comment on the candy since that part is still sealed. This is one of those great little novelty trinkets that makes little kids so excited. Ee got only one, at a store, but I am considering buying this 12 pack to always have a laser projector pop on hand for a treat/bribe.

review/summary: Really cool candy
review/text: I didn't but the twelve pack but I did buy a single at the store.  I got it at Fastop  for $1.50 which is a good deal considering the unit price is $1.67 when you buy it in the pack of 12.  The product is a flashlight shaped piece of plastic with a light on button on the side.  There is no switch so it cannot remain on constantly.  One end of the flash light has the light bulb and the other side has a compartment where you twist the bottom and the candy comes out.  There is a 1.25 inch candy inside the compartment.  The candy is 99% the same as a push-pop.  The candy can be stored for later by closing the compartment.  I have no idea how long the battery lasts.  One flashlight is about 5 inches tall and 1 inch thick so it is quite small compared to a regular flash light.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> -The bulb is brighter than I expected.  In a dim room, the image can be projected about 20 feet, creating an image about 3 feet in diameter.  In a dark area, the light can travel almost 50 feet!<br />-Good price point<br />-Candy taste alright<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Candy is very small.  (21 grams)<br />-No idea how long the battery will last.<br />-Kids will make a lot of trouble and get into fights.  This is probably the biggest downfall to the product as kids will point it at each other's faces and cause possible eye damage.  You don't need to be a certain age to buy it so any kid can buy it.

The instructions tell you to smack the orange on a hard surface.  This will allow the sections to separate so you can eat your "orange" section by section.

review/summary: Terry's Dark Chocolate in Hot Weather
review/text: I just love these!  However, the most recent order evidently must have been subjected to very high temperature either in the warehouse or in shipping(it was during the over-100 stretch of heat).  It arrived promptly, but I regret that it was inedible, having melted and "frosted", then resolidified; all six chocolate "oranges "were a totally misshapen lumps.<br /><br />I reported it and the costs were promptly credited to my card.  I was well satisfied with the handling of the problem, but I think I will wait until cooler weather before submitting another order.

review/text: I first tried Terry's Milk Chocolate Orange at a friend's house. A perfect, and satisfying dessert to share after our dinner. Not to mention the fun in whacking open the orange to see all the pieces disperse from its center. I was so pleased with the fun and delicious chocolate that I ordered some myself. Being a chocolate lover myself, I tried the dark chocolate and was just as pleased with the smooth quality of the chocolate and lingering hint of orange. A great gift for other fellow chocolate lovers, or even those who love oranges, and a fun indulgence for oneself whenever there is a craving for some chocolate!

review/summary: Horrible!!
review/text: These were the worst food colors that I've ever used, but I blame that on the seller not the manufacturer. Some of the bottles that I receive seem to work fine (by which I mean are the correct color and dissolve/integrate properly). At least half the bottles I got are TERRIBLE for a few reasons: 1) both the fushia and the burgundy are no where near to pink or red! They are a sludgy brown color! Not a nice brown like maybe the bottle was mislabeled, but a disgusting rotten brown color. So for our Easter egg dying, no pink! All but 3 or 4 of the remaining bottles are so dried out or old (or I don't know what the problem is) that they won't even dissolve! I heated the liquid I was trying to color, but that didn't help. I mushed the food coloring gel through a fine sieve, hoping I could break up the chunks and get them to dissolve, but instead this just created lots of tiny little clumps floating around. The couple colors that work properly (yellow, mint green) seem great and the colors are vibrant, but most of the bottles are completely worthless.

review/summary: Wish there was more color variety
review/text: This is a good quality set of colors. I wish there was more variety of color, instead of various shades that aren't very different. A dark blue would be nice instead of a third shade of peach. The paste is thick which makes it easy to control the quantity, but harder to blend. My food color uses are pretty mundane - stuff for the kids to play with, making foods look funny, frosting, and the amount of time it takes to get the color distributed and not streaky is pretty frustrating.<br /><br />I probably won't buy them again, to be honest.

review/summary: Best Cat Food!
review/text: I love this food for my cat.  She has been on it for years and it's really the best for her breed.  If you own a Siamese cat you know that they love to eat quickly, and will usually toss up the food because of this.  This food is shaped so that they are forced to chew it and that slows them down.  Now, that doesn't mean that they will never toss up, but it drastically reduces it.  It's very high in protein and keep her lean and never overweight.  She has been very health all her life and her check-ups are always clean.  She has never had a UTI or other digestive issues.  The food is pricey, but it works so well.

review/text: I use this food for both my young Siamese and my older cat, a former stray (not Siamese).  We have to watch the older cat's weight carefully.  Both cats eat too fast, and this food seems to slow them down.<br /><br />I recently tried to (slowly) switch them to a premium "all-natural grain-free" brand, and the older cat, who has medium-length hair, began to get daily hairballs no matter how much we brushed her.  We switched back to Royal Canin Siamese, and she hasn't had any problems since.  So the Royal Canin seems to help prevent hairballs also.

review/summary: Spreadable Biscoff Cookies
review/text: The Biscoff Spread is unbelievable! The spread is made up of 57% Biscoff cookies. It totally captures the flavor of the cookies yet in the creamy consistency of peanut butter - but of course it's not peanut butter. It's amazing on toast, as a frosting for chocolate cupcakes, and for dipping fruit. It's available in the USA (finally!).<br /><br />In 2007, a Belgium reality show featured two inventors who created a spread (think Nuttella or peanut butter) out of Biscoff Cookies (they are called Speculoos in Europe). Lotus purchased one, patented it, and began producing the spread in 2008. Other companies followed. Lotus brought a lawsuit and lost the first round. There's nothing like cookie drama! I've tried 3 different brands, Lotus brand stands out as the most "cookie-like" and creamy.<br /><br />In Europe? Look for Speculoos Crunchy Spread. This one has 66% Biscoff cookies in a courser consistency (think: crunchy peanut butter). Not available yet in the USA. Worth an airplane ticket to Belgium to buy!<br /><br />Biscoff Spread, a fantastic turn toward the delicious!<br /><br />From: Best Anywhere Reviews

review/text: Yes, this stuff is tasty. It can be used like peanut butter as it says on the package, so I suppose on bread, fruits, ice cream, milk shakes. I saw a recipe for a microwave mug cake using this spread. BUT be careful - it is not as healthy as peanut butter, so I don't see it as a real alternative. Peanut butter is great for feeling full in a jiffy, because it has healthy fats and protein. This spread is basically a dessert and that's all, and has next to no nutrition. I have to keep reminding myself of that, so I don't turn biscoff-spread-on-bread into one of my usual snack foods.

review/summary: A delicious and different treat!
review/text: I was lucky enough to discover Biscoff Spread  (with smudged labels) at the 99 cents store and decided to give it a try since I am such a fan of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FFK40">Biscoff brand of Belgian speculoos cookies</a> that they have served for many years on Delta Air Lines.  It's an odd concept, a spread made of cookies, but I'm glad that I didn't let that stop me from trying it.<br /><br />The label says that this is a "European alternative to peanut butter."  I completely disagree as it it only has the look and texture of peanut butter.  It smells and tastes just like the Biscoff cookies, but sweeter, with a hint of caramelized sugar and cinnamon.  It is much more like dulce de leche than peanut butter.<br /><br />This spread is good with ice cream; on pancakes, scones, and apples; or just eaten from a spoon as a nice treat after a meal.  A thin layer even salvaged the plain graham crackers I bought by mistake instead of the cinnamon honey variety.  It would also be good on cupcakes, waffles, or popovers.  Eating it on toast doesn't appeal to me but maybe with raisin bread it would be good.  It really is tasty and hard to resist, especially with milk or coffee.<br /><br />The basic recipe for Biscoff spread is speculoos cookies, canola oil, and sugar so it's not particularly healthy.  Each tablespoon has 88 calories with 52 of them from fat.  On the bright side, a tablespoon only has 33 mg of sodium.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Biscoff 57% (wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oils [one or more of soy bean oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, palm oil], soy flour, brown sugar, sodium bicarbonate, salt, cinnamon), canola oil, sugar, soy lecithin, citric acid.

The taste of cookies was so unexpected that it actually took a few seconds to get the full flavor as I figured out what it was.<br /><br />Yes, you can actually buy a jar full of cookie paste, and it is delicious.  I wish they would put this stuff in those little single-serve plastic packets normally used for ketchup and mustard.  I would totally walk around with a pocket full of them so I could pull one out any time I wanted a cookie infusion.<br /><br />And no, it doesn't quite taste like cookie dough.

review/text: If you like Biscoff cookies, you'll love this stuff. There are no words that can express how wonderfully delicious this stuff truly is. I had my doubts when I ordered it but my love for Biscoff cookies convinced me to at least try it. I am so glad I did.<br /><br />It's smooth like creamy peanut butter and for those that haven't tasted the wonderfulness that is a Biscoff cookie, it's very hard to adequately describe it's flavor. Another reviewer said it was similar to a graham and I think another one thought it was closer to gingersnaps. I guess those the best american cracker/cookie comparisons, so for lack of better descriptions, imagine those two combined. For what it's worth, if you're like me, I don't really like gingersnaps and grahams are just ok but I think Biscoffs are heavenly. Just take the plunge and buy this spread, it's a great treat just out of the jar & an awesome "mystery flavor" for baked goods, everyone will ask you what your secret ingredient is!

review/summary: How can a jarred spread taste like cookies?
review/text: I spend a lot of time looking at recipes.  I follow several food blogs and foodgawker is a daily addiction, which is how I first heard about s Biscoff Spread.  In one day, on several different recipe sites, I kept seeing Biscoff mentioned.  The first was for a cookie ball made using biscoff, since the recipe poster said you could substitute butter for the Biscoff, I mistakenly assumed that Biscoff was a butter alternative that I hadn't heard of before.  But later I saw it mentioned again and then again on different sites and with increasingly rapturous praises for this 'amazing delicacy' and I just had to find out what it was.<br /><br />I'm just that way, if all the cool kids are eating Biscoff, I need to know what Biscoff is before I dismiss it as a trendy waste of time.<br /><br />As it turns out Biscoff is not new.  At least in Europe it isn't and after just one tiny taste of the heavenly stuff, I think I can safely predict that it will soon be a regular product on store shelves in North America.<br /><br />Like others before me have mentioned Biscoff is sweet and has a texture somewhere between Nutella (sticky, hard to spread if it isn't at a room temp and whipped cream cheese, airy and light, easy to plop onto a cool bagel (the weather has been super cold here and still the Biscoff was spreadable with a spoon right after delivery).<br /><br />The texture is smooth with a slight powdery-ness and it tastes sweet. just like a cookie.  In fact, it tastes like cookies, which is so strange that at first I wasn't sure if I liked it, so I took another bite and it was blissful, sweet but not too sweet, just the way I like my cookies, nom nom.  Biscoff is a melt-y, buttery, cookie delight, I like it even more than Nutella and I have an urge to hide the jars, so that I wont have have to share them with my husband and son!<br /><br />While Biscoff is tasty alone, it felt like I should try it out on something, I put a smidge on a thin ginger crisp, yum, tried some on a slice of apple and then a smear on a piece of toast (my bread was stale and kinda yecky, so it wasn't that great).  The options are flipping endless.

review/summary: Where has this been all my life?
review/text: I stopped by my local grocery the other night and notice some fresh croissants in the bakery section.  I normally don't by such things but they looked so good that I picked them up and tossed them in the cart.  Once I got home, I saw a little sample package of Biscoff Spread tucked inside.  Thinking it was like peanut butter, I put it aside and it wasn't until there was only one croissant left that I opened the sample and tried it.  OMG - after I finished it, I literally licked the little package.  I went back to the grocery store the next day, praying that they carried it in the full size version.  There it was!!!!  Tucked on the top shelf above the peanut butter, next to the Nutella.  It was pricey, $4.98 for 18 ounces - but in my humble opinion, worth every cent.

review/text: We use to buy the biscoff cookies years ago. A show on the Food Network mentioned the spread and we had to try it. It is not available at our store yet, so we will buy it online until Kroger carries it. It's a perfect replacement for peanut butter. It's good on bread with bananas and honey or jelly, and on crackers or by the spoonfuls. Try the cookies (which are available in the stores) first, if you're not sure about the spread. They both taste exactly the same.

You can also get this at the Wafels and Dinges truck in NYC, if you want to try it out.

review/summary: Spread of the Gods
review/text: I don't review a lot of things on Amazon, so that should tell you something. Biscoff Spread transcends anything I've ever tasted. It must have found its way to Earth from another realm, settling happily into my awaiting mouth. I discovered it at Publix the other day sitting conspicuously with the peanut butter. I love Biscoff cookies, so I figured, why not give this a try. It tastes exactly as presented...Biscoff cookies in spread form. Actually, it's better than the cookie. In terms of nutritional content, it's got about the same amount of fat and calories as peanut butter, and as you'd expect, almost twice as much carbs and sugar. So it should be used more sparingly than peanut butter, but it's worth every bit.<br /><br />I went Gollum over this stuff within a few hours of having it in my cabinet...it's seriously addicting. It's cheaper if you can find it in the store, but still more expensive than peanut butter...totally worth it, though.<br /><br />This was a new find for me, and I hope stores continue to carry it...otherwise, people will start bootlegging it and selling it alongside crack.<br /><br />It's that good.

review/text: I am pretty strict about Low Carb because that is my WOE, but this is the one item that I will probably keep in my cupboard that is definitely not low carb.  It is so delicious that it is hard to explain!  I have never had the Biscoff cookies either, but while running through Central Market and grabbing all of my fav items before heading back home, a sample lady asked me to try it.  I sort of wish I hadn't.  I spread a smithering on my rice cake and oh.my.goodness. I did a double take!  Heaven in a spread.  It tastes nothing like peanut butter, but it has the spread and consistency of peanut butter.<br /><br />I have no earthly idea what I will spread this on, because it will probably have to be apples or oopsies, because this is one of those items that really belongs to the High Carb crowd.  :D

review/summary: I keep the jar in the freezer, it's even better cold
review/text: Recently, I bought a jar of this after having dental surgery when I was limited to liquids and mush foods for 2 weeks. I had never tried Biscoff spread before but I wasn't disappointed. Lemme tell you, Biscoff Spread made the 2 weeks bearable, but I went through the jar in about 3 days, taking tiny amounts of it off a dull butter knife because I couldn't really open my mouth much. It doesn't have protein like peanut butter does so for me it won't be a pb replacement... for me, Biscoff is a dessert treat. A super fantastic treat. I'm going to buy these as stocking stuffers - If you like cookies and you like the consistency of peanut butter, this spread is very good.<br /><br />Biscoff spread is amazingly tasty but it isn't health food, as I'm sure you've noticed if you've ever looked at the nutrition label. =) But everything in moderation, right? I'm one of those people who likes a bite of sweetness after a meal and this spread is a wonderful, rich treat.<br /><br />*Update* I bought a 2nd jar locally the other day but this time it wasn't as thick and it was rather greasy feeling in my mouth, and it dissolved in a second so I didn't get to savor the flavor of it much. I realized that we were now keeping the house about 6* warmer than we were just a couple of weeks ago and this temperature change was enough to alter the consistency of the Biscoff spread... a 74*F house was too warm. I now keep the jar in the refrigerator (edit: I now keep the jar in the freezer, it's even better! and because I have to basically chip it out of the jar, it slows me down when eating it so I can't shovel spoonfuls of the stuff into my face), and found that I really like the spread when it's cold (I eat it straight off a spoon, I don't spread this on anything). So if you happen to try Biscoff spread and you think it's greasy and isn't as thick as you like, it may be because your house is a bit too warm... try keeping the jar in the fridge or freezer.

review/summary: My NEW NUTELLA......
review/text: This is my new Nutella.....This craze is taking over.  I found it to be addictive. My husband who hates toasts & spreads & jams, ate 2 sandwiches!! I myself could not believe it. I have already tasted Biscoff cookies a few years ago.  And when I saw this at the local Walmart, I decided to give it a try.  I already picked up French bread from the bakery and completely surprised by the $1 instant coupon on top the lid ($1 off when you purchase French Bread)!!  So, the next day, for breakfast, there was this wonderful toast with Biscoff spread.  And I also tried it on apple slices.  YUMMY!!  But the only downside (if any) is that it could taste good only with bread* and apples, maybe because of cinnamon. But then, bread and apples are good for you! My 3-year old son (A very picky eater, most of the times plainly refusing to try new stuff) ate this and asked for more.  I remember going gaga over nutella when it hit the aisles. This is the newest entry and here-to-stay spread.<br /><br />As one negative review calls it greasy, well, nutella is.  And so is butter or vegetable oil spread.  When it tastes yummy and it is vegan, it is a good-to-go product.  As for calories, if you are on diet, why are you even here reading about spreads?  A smear or two on toasts everyday cannot do any harm.  I went ahead and made my own French bread and tried it.  OMG, deadly.<br /><br />P.S: *Bread means all kinds of breads like plain scones, bagels, muffins etc.  BTW, I also melted it for a few seconds in the Microwave and used it as a dip for homemade soft pretzels - WOW!!  I am now thinking of using it as cake filling or icing.  I bet it will work especially on apple cake!!

It basically tastes heavenly on anything or even by itself.<br /><br />The bad - the seller packaged both jars together with no protection between them, which caused one of the jars to break.  Fortunately, the other jar is fine, but essentially, I got one jar for the price of two.  I could get a refund if I return everything, but I don't want to return the undamaged jar, because the product is so good.

review/text: I had never had Biscoff Spread, heck I never had a Biscoff cookie before.  I had seen a few blogs where the spread and cookies were used in recipes for cookies and bars with rave reviews so I knew I had to find them.  When I began my search, I easily found the cookies at my local "high-end" market.  The spread was a different matter.  I searched high and low to no avail.  So I bit the bullet and purchased it through Amazon.  It is so delicious and although I haven't used it in recipes (yet), just spreading some on a wheat cracker is a tasty treat.  I just wish I could find it at a grocery store because I know it costs less than what I paid on Amazon!

If you are going to send this to someone as a gift you'd do better to buy a jar at a local grocery store, walk down to a UPS store and ship it yourself.  In this day and age, more than 10 days to ship something is ridiculous.  The makers of Biscoff better change their shipping policy or they will not get repeat business.  The shipping method is the only reason I've downgraded this product from a 5 star to a 3 star.

He gets some raw frozen (which we have for our other dog) but this guy actually does better with the raw frozen and a mix of the Honest Kitchen Thrive and Preference than just on raw alone.  We were giving him some high quality kibble but the vet suggested this was adding to his weight issues, said she's found that the less the food was processed, the more lean muscle mass the dogs tend to have.  Plus dehydrated is great to have on hand all the time.  Recently HK has begun packaging the food in a ziplock bag which should be great, the old bags were a pain to try to keep properly sealed.  Since I am only feeding one dog, and buy the bigger packages for the cost savings, I've been pouring the food into half-gallon mason jars and then removing the air with my FoodSaver jar sealer - works great!

review/summary: Not RAW, not honest
review/text: Notice how it says "Raw dog food" then "with chicken". It's written this way because it's not entirely raw, the chicken is cooked. Cooked proteins are likely to be allergenic! The whole point of a raw diet it for it to be raw so it isn't allergenic and is easy to digest, and of course the most important part of the dog's diet is the protein source. I wish this company would stop trying to trick people into thinking their food is raw. Some dogs do not do well on this product. The owners assume it is raw and then assume raw doesn't work. In many of these cases, the dog would benefit from a truly raw diet. For this reason I really wish The Honest Kitchen would straighten up and give up the practice of deceit. They are essentially harming many, many animals who could find relief on a truly raw diet. I have already had this discussion with their representative many years ago. The company did change their wording so that they no longer tell outright lies, but it is still deceptive. I can't imagine they care about anyone's pet if they carry on like this. If your pet has had issues such as hot spots, digestive upset, body odor, itchy feet or any other chronic condition, ask your vet if it could be an allergy to the cooked proteins in this diet. If it is, and you were under the impression that you were feeding raw protein, let the manufacturer know. They have to know how many pets they are harming, or they will never straighten up.

review/text: A wonderful change from corned beef. Great for morning meals, or substitute for ham. Not as salty or fatty as ham or corned beef.

review/summary: Really traditional Irish bacon
review/text: I used this to make a traditional Irish dish for my son. He really liked it. I couldn't enjoy it because of new denture, but still have some in the freezer in vacuum bags(there were four pounds and I quartered it) and plan on making up for it. Wes said he thought it tasted like corned beef. I'll let you know.
