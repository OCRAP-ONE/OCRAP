review/summary: Good flavor, but NOT AT ALL Spicy
review/text: It's tasty (we used it to make kimchi), but it is not at all spicy.  Very disappointing from that aspect.  We made a small batch of kimchi (4 quarts) and used two cups of these hot pepper flakes.  It's only barely spicier than paprika.  :(  If cayenne pepper is a 10, then this is a 2-3.  I don't think that "Hot Pepper Coarse Type Powder" is a good descriptor.  Maybe replace the word "Hot" with the word "Red".  It's definitely red, but it is certainly NOT hot.

review/summary: Wonderful Columbian Coffee
review/text: We are fairly new to Keurig K-cups so we are experimenting with various brands.  We love the wonderful rich taste of the Columbian Excelencia and also their Decaf. It isn't watery at all I think the previous reviewer got a bad batch and I hope got their cups replaced.<br /><br />The coffee is a medium roast but perfect for our taste with a rich flavor. I almost hate to recommend it because supply appears to be diminishing and I want to make sure I get a good supply stocked up.<br /><br />The decaf is great, it tastes like the best coffee in the world, but has no caffeine to keep you up at night. I think of all the K-cup brands we've tried so far, this is our favorite!

review/summary: Watery, bland coffee
review/text: I'm not sure if I received a bad batch, but this coffee is horrible and watery.<br />I drink probably 2 cups a day from my Keurig and have been very happy so far<br />until I purchased Timothy's Colombian Excelencia.<br /><br />I like my coffee with milk, but after I made the first cup it tasted like watered<br />down milk with a very mild coffee flavor. I thought it might be a bad kcup, so I made<br />a second, but had the same results.<br /><br />I made a 3rd cup in a clear juice glass to and it looks like dark tea more than coffee.<br />If you like a very watery, extra light cup of coffee, you might enjoy this. To me<br />Timothy's Colombian Excelencia shouldn't even be considered coffee it is so watery. I<br />decided to make a breakfast blend instead and I didn't have the same issue. Maybe an entirely<br />bad batch of kcups? Either way these are horrible.

review/text: These are amazing if you have a restricted diet, if you don't have to eat this way I'm not sure it's worth it as they are more expensive than wheat pasta and slightly rubbery- BUT taste so much better than rice pasta (which I find fishy) and better texture than rice which falls apart. I find mung bean takes on any sauce really well tomato, Alfredo, peanut whatever awesome. Good in soups also. Corn is a firmer pasta but the taste overwhelms and mung bean has protein much healthier.

review/summary: Out of balance
review/text: This was the second tree I purchased online, both ended with bad experiences.  The trees were purchased at separate time; they both died within 2 months after purchases.  This particular tree was sitting in a 6" container, but it was much smaller than the one shown in the picture - The plant was only about 4" to 5" tall (with scarce branching); sitting in the 6" pot, it made the planting completely out of proportion.  After it died, I took the tree out to do the cleaning, there was not much roots in the first place.  I assume the seller hurriedly pushed a new young plant into the soils just prior to shipping out the order.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: The tree came on time; but two words describe the tree I receive:  Ugly and sickly.  Obviously, I am not as lucky as the others in the reviews had said their trees were so wonderful.  Mine is consisted of only one twig, no branching, nothing like the picture!  I contacted the seller; he told me that in the description it says, "Tree shape and size may vary" and refused to exchange my purchase.  I understand that every bonsai tree may have been shaped differently but mine hardly has any shape at all; it is not artistically styled to be a bonsai tree, it is basically a slim twig stick inside a ceramic container.  I guess you have to be so lucky to receive a decent tree as shown in the picture.  Awful experience, I am very disappointed!

review/text: I bought it for a birthday present for my mother who has a large plant collection already. The tree came fast and well packaged. The picture presented is fairly accurate. The tree is simply in soil whereas the picture shows some rocks. Also the picture is a full tree growing out all angles. The one I received is growing only to 1 side.<br /><br />All in all though this product is a fantastic deal. I fully recommend it and would buy another if I ever was in the market for another Bonsai. My mother loved it.

review/summary: Fresh rice crackers
review/text: I have been looking for a product to replace Kirkland asian snack mix with nuts since they have discontinued it.  I bought this 3lb package of rice crackers with nuts to see how it was.  The product was well packaged in a plastic lined paper sack that was reclosable.  The crackers were very crunchy and fresh, good tasting, but I could find only a handful of nuts.  Some cashews, almonds and peanuts.  If you have eaten the Kirkland brand there are ALOT of nuts but this mix had very few nuts.<br />  I added some cashews and almonds that I had to the mixture. Then I had nuts.<br />  So I was spoiled by the first kirkland mixture, now will continue on my search for a replacement.<br />  I gave it 3 stars because it was rice crackers with very few nuts.

review/summary: Yankee Clipper Rolled Anchovies
review/text: I recently needed anchovies to make a Caesar salad.  Though I would've normally preferred the flat variety, none were available, so I bought the rolled thinking that there wouldn't be much difference between the two apart from the capers.  I had never purchased Yankee Clipper brand before but thinking that all grocery store anchovies were about equal, I bought them.  This belief was shattered upon opening the can.  The rolled anchovies looked very old (they sort of liquified when handled), were utterly flavorless (unless one thinks that anchovies need only to taste salty), and were packed in an oily slime that didn't resemble any olive oil that I was familiar with.  In sum, these are an extremely low-quality product, priced at or near the same price as such so-called gourmet-level canned anchovies.  Avoid.

review/summary: NOT lower carb than Kraft or General Mills - why bother? Better alternatives out there for low carbers
review/text: My local Italian restaurant knows I'm low carb, so the chef was excited to tell me they found a great low carb pasta. I was quite excited too - he had purchased this brand, it was very good.<br /><br />BUT ... I went online to order it for myself, and actually read the nutritional count. It's NOT low carb. In fact, it's HIGHER carbs than many mainstream whole grain pastas!<br /><br />I checked the supermarket shelf - you don't even have to go to the health food isle to find lower carbs than this. The General Mills, Kraft, Barilla, even Trader Joe's whole grain pastas (starting at $0.99 cents per box) have on average 17.5 carbs (less 1.5 fiber = 16 net carbs).<br /><br />To be fair, the "CarbNada" brand has a generous portion size - 1.5 cups. I would probably not eat more than 1 cup at a time, so my serving size would be 12 net carbs. But still, the Atkins brand has half the carbs compared to this! (usually 4-8 net carbs per serving).<br /><br />My suggested alternatives:<br /><br />* Atkins has a few pastas that start at 4 net carbs. I will not eat a packaged pasta that's higher than 5 or 6 net carbs.<br /><br />* Use julienned zucchini or squash instead of pasta - use it raw (soaked in olive oil for a few minutes), cook it (like mac & cheese), or lightly steam it in the microwave or in a steamer. It's much much healthier than packaged/processed pasta anyway, and almost zero net carbs. (You might want to skin it first)<br /><br />* The best veggie to use for pasta is cucazza. You must always skin cucazza, then run it through a mandolin slicer on the julienne setting. Seriously, this takes 20 seconds.<br /><br />* And, the BEST low carb pasta I've ever had is made from kelp - dehydrated kelp noodles. This one is not found in most stores, but you can find it online. Kelp is one of the best foods you should be eating, low carb or not. High in protein, high in minerals/vitamins/nutrients, and very low carbs (about 1 net carb), and nearly zero glycemic index. Plus, the noodles don't have to be boiled - just put in warm water for about 60 seconds. And they work with everything.<br /><br />* Keep looking for other brands. They're out there. The best low carb breads and pastas are made from flax seeds. If you like the refined flour, light & fluffy breads & pastas, the best brands use a combination of soy isolate + almond flour &/or flax.<br /><br />Bottom line: I believe this company's product labeling is opportunistic & slightly disingenuous. There are much better alternatives.

review/summary: good, but not their best flavor
review/text: All three of the other flavors (basil, garlic, egg) taste better than this one, but for a low carb, high protein pasta this is still delicious.  I don't really understand people complaining that this has too many carbohydrates.  This has 24 carbs minus 6 grams of fiber for 18 net carbs per serving.  The entire bag has 90 net carbs.  I don't see the problem.  Furthermore, this has 12 grams of protein per serving.<br /><br />The texture if you cook it exactly for 5 minutes (as per the instructions) is al dente.<br /><br />Please, please make the garlic and basil available for the subscribe and save  pack of 6.

review/summary: A GREAT LOWER CARB PASTA
review/text: If you're watching your carbs and miss egg noodles, Carba Nada is a good replacement. It isn't greatly low carb, but quite a bit less than regular pasta, so you need to watch serving sizes, but it cooks in only 5 minutes and accepts tomato and other sauces very well. The different flavours add more variety, and its also easy to toss with some butter, parmesan, and seasonings. Add leftover chicken or beef, and some vegetables, and you have a quick easy meal for less carbs.

review/summary: Tastes a little funky, but you get used to it...
review/text: Admittedly, the first sip I took I almost spit it out.  This stuff is a bit spicy!  You can definitely taste the ginger in this, so if you're not a fan of ginger, this may not be for you.  Fans of chai would probably like this tea more, as it does have a strong, spicy taste.  I've been drinking this tea for the past week (a tea bag a day), and have started acclimating to it.  On second and third tasting, this tea became tolerable, and now I actually quite enjoy it.  I let it steep for 10 minutes, since the spicy + piping hot combo makes me sweat, and it's summer.  Also found that I don't need to sweeten it, even though I usually like sweetening my teas.  This tea does warm you right up.<br /><br />I have to say, the first couple of days I think this tea had a reverse laxative effect, if you know what I mean.  I felt a bit stuck.  But now that my body's adjusted to it, it's been doing its job well.  Also, unexpected benefit has been clearer skin.  I'm not sure if this is a direct effect of the tea, but since it's the only thing I've changed in my diet/routine this past week, I suspect it may be it.  Score!!<br /><br />Wouldn't say this tea bag is on the "cheap" side of the tea bag spectrum, but it's not too bad.  I don't think I've gotten to the point of sipping this out of enjoyment, and probably never will.  But so far, I've seen its health benefits, and that alone motivates me to continue on.  Would recommend at least trying to stick to finishing the box in a timely fashion to see its health results, though.

It is a very nice tea for right before bed, and does not need sugar or honey for a nice flavor. I would order it again, however I think my 6 boxes will keep me well stocked for a very long time. My favorite tea from yogi is the Cocoa Spice, which I suggest to everyone as it has a nice deep flavor and can be taken with or without milk.

review/summary: It grew on me
review/text: I bought this tea expecting it to be peach flavored and boy was I surprised how spicy it was. Tastes more like ginger and pepper than it does peach which is why I only gave it four stars. Anyways, I like to drink it when my stomach feels a little off or I am a bit nauseous. Seems to help and it's not too strong. A nice change from my regular green tea.

review/summary: effective, but not too hard on the body
review/text: I have stayed away from detox teas from yogi for a couple of years now because I had bad experiences with the regular detox for the whole body.(not sure of the exact tea)  This one I wanted to try because it would help with water retention.  Wow! To my surprise, so many more benefits - my sinus' are clearer, my appetite is changing, I cannot drink as much coffe or consume as much sugar (2 things that I really craved.)  I use 1 teabag in the morning, let it seep for about 15 mins and then I mix it in with my water/iced tea throughout the day, much easier on my system - and I am not running to the bathroom every 10 mins.  I tried 2 teabags in one day and I felt horrible - It was just too much for me.  So 1 bag, very good and and I have got to be losing weight with the appetite change and no more excess water weight that comes with sinus, allergy issues

review/text: I've tried a few different detox tea and many of them taste truly disgusting.  Not the case with Yogi Tea Peach DeTox!  It's lovely to drink, tastes like any other nice fruity herbal tea.  Not a hint of disgustingness.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because it's hard to tell whether any "detox" product is actually working.  I drink it and hope for the best.

review/text: I bought this tea because I am a huge detox tea drinker. This flavor is just not for me. I think the tea is hard to swallow sometimes because of the strange peach flavor. I don't think it is your typical peach flavor. It's strange and I'm not good at describing flavors. In terms of detoxing, I also think it does an average job. I think it cleansed me the first week I drank it, but after that... not so much.

review/text: Dried fruit is a great alternative to chips and cookies when I'm at work and need a snack. I found Emerald via Amazon's grocery section and am so happy I did. I got the subscription (for the price) and my family loves them. They are great for late night cravings too. The fruit is sweet, easy to bite/chew and tastes like the fruit. I've had dried fruit that 1.didn't taste like what it was supposed to be and 2.left an after taste. This brand is delicious. My only complaint and the reason for only 4 stars, is that there are way too many prunes (plums). I would prefer for apricots (not hardly enough) and dried apples. We never eat the prunes so it feels like a waste.

review/summary: The best italian pasta available, unfortunately no longer affordable
review/text: I know this pasta brand for many years, back in Germany I used to pay around 6 DM for 1 kg. That would be 3$ for 2.2 pounds for Americans.<br />And I thought that was pretty expensive! But I bought it regularly and really loved it.<br /><br />Then 5 years ago I came to the USA, and among so many other things I missed the foods from home. How happy was I to find out Martelli was sold over here, too!<br /><br />Of course, it was very expensive, even more expensive than in Germany. 5,50$ for a bag (and at the time I did not understand USA-measurements, was not aware they sell only half the size over here!). So I thought the 2.2 pound bag would be expensive with 5,50 $, and for 3 years I could not afford to mail order it. You have to pay 15 $ postage for any order, so I figured any order below 150 $ would not be reasonable with that postage fee.<br /><br />Last year, after the winter holiday, I got some money and finally did it: I ordered my beloved Martelli pasta. And it is really wonderful.<br />Only I saw that I got half the amount I was thinking to get. The bags contain 500g, which is exactly half of what I used to buy in Germany. And I paid 5,50 $ each plus postage now! Almost twice the price for half the weight - uhm - does that make it quadroopled?<br /><br />Now my birthday came in July, I got money again, and I am looking into another order. But - oh shock! The price of 5,50$ has turned into 8$ now. And the bags did not turn into the original sizes (1ooog or 1kg).<br /><br />Wow - is that a sign the dollar loses its value completely now?<br /><br />Would it not be cheaper to order the pasta in Italy or France or Germany and have it shipped overseas to me? I guess I would get a better deal.<br /><br />I checked it, the bags in Europe still contain 1kg, and I saw them offered online for 6 Euros. I guess I will have to make some serious calculations.<br /><br />But the order from amazon is unthinkable now.<br /><br />Rustichella d'abruzzo is second best. Also expensive, but I guess I can afford that with forsaking other things.

review/summary: BEWARE--contains undeclared soy
review/text: My 6 month old son has allergic colitis with sensitivities to both dairy and soy.  When we gave him Earth's Best Whole Grain Rice Cereal for infants (which does not list any milk or soy ingredients), he had a bad reaction, so I called the company to find out if the tocopherols (vitamin E) in the cereal are soy-based and they said "yes" even though the ingredients on the package say nothing about soy.  We were very disappointed in Earth's Best for failing to protect babies with allergies/sensitivities.  Fortunately our baby is OK now, and we've switched to HappyBellies cereal which is great and clearly labeled as dairy and soy free.

review/summary: beware-beetle larvae
review/text: We had read good reviews for the Earth's Best baby food line (including a recommendation in the Baby Bargains book).  So, when we began feeding our 6 month old baby boy solids, we were prepared to feed this exclusively except when we could cook for him.  He had been getting the whole grain rice cereal and the jarred fruits and vegetables.  Two weeks ago, I was making him cereal from a new box (the second time he had been fed from that box) and I found a live beetle larva in the bowl.  I looked through the rest of the box and found an outer skin of another.  Today, I was talking with a co-worker and she said that they had the same experience with the Earth's Best Whole Grain Rice cereal and now the beetles have infested their home! We suspect that theses are khapra beetles and have alerted the USDS and the FDA.  The manufacturer offered to send coupons and said that this is rare, but now I am doubtful that this was just a fluke since my co-worker had the same experience and these were purchased in different states.  I am disappointed that it is difficult to find good organic baby food.

review/text: We have been buying the Earth's Best brand cereal for my son from the very beginning. Though now we use it only to mix in with the runnier jarred foods. 12 boxes will last a LONG time. I think we have gone through not quite 2 boxes in the past 3 months. We also use plain oatmeal, a flavored oatmeak, and a mixed-grain for variety. Your baby might vary but depending on when you switch to finger foods, a 12-pack like this could go to waste.

review/text: I used to get this for my twin babies by subscription at a fair price.  But the subscription offer expired and my goodness the price increased.  Back to the stores I go to keep getting this product.<br /><br />This cereal is much better than most and I found that even better ones were far more expensive.  My babies have liked this rice cereal from the beginning and still do after over a year.<br /><br />I believe this is the best of the Earth's Best cereals.  The oat Earth's Best Whole Grain cereal is oat FLOUR whereas this one is whole brown rice.  That's a qualitative difference.  You can generally get the oat flour cereal cheaper than this whole brown rice cereal.<br /><br />This cereal mixes very well with formula, which is how we started using it when the babies were still on formula.<br /><br />Always compare prices as they change dramatically sometimes.

The good thing about this cereal is that it is small enough that it will pass through most nipples  (if you want to put it in a bottle in case your baby has difficulty eating from a spoon in the beginning).  My baby doesn't have any difficulty digesting it.  So the cereal itself is fine.  The bad part of this product is the packaging.  When I received the Amazon box containing 10 of these, the cereal flakes were already all over the box even though it wasn't apparent that any cereal box exploded. It was a pain cleaning it up.  Then I opened the clear wrap on one individual cereal box.  Again, the cereal flakes were all over the place.  It was a pain cleaning it up.  Then the way to dispense the cereal from the box is not very good - it is made of paper, it doesn't seal well once opened (so I am afraid ants may crawl in) and the opening is too big.... so every time you pour the cereal into a bottle, the cereal goes all over the place.  I think they should just have it in a can with a scoop like Earth's Best's formula.

review/summary: 4th Beware - Baby had bad reaction to this! 0 stars!
review/text: We ended up in urgent care last night and I'm 99% sure this product is why. We fed it to him two weeks ago mixed with breastmilk and he loved it! However, hours later he threw up a couple of times. It wasn't a large amount so I wasn't too concerned, however we decided to wait another 2 weeks to try again as he just turned 5 months old. We tried sweet potatoes a week later instead of cereal and he did fine with them for 6 days so we decided to give cereal another shot so he could get the iron from it. Well, about 2-3 hours after eating the cereal he got really sweaty/clammy and threw up a MASSIVE amount of vomit to the point he was throwing up bright green/yellow bile. I called the on-call doctor as this was in the evening and she said that if he threw up again to go to urgent care or the ER. He threw up again at home and once again in the waiting room at urgent care. The nurse checked his vitals and wasn't sure what his problem was and sent us home and just told us to push fluids. He nursed fine all last night and today and hasn't thrown up since. I'm throwing this crap out. I thought I was being a good mommy by getting "organic whole grain brown rice" cereal. I probably would've been better off with Gerber. If I try rice again, I'm going to mill it myself! But, I'm honestly kind of scared to even try it again after the nightmare we went through last night.

review/summary: Contains inorganic arsenic, a known carcinogen
review/text: I had been feeding my baby this cereal for 3 months when I learned that Consumer Reports had tested this product for arsenic along with many other organic rice products and found it contains inorganic arsenic, the type that results from pesticide residue in the soil.  This shouldn't be confused with the arsenic that they will tell you "occurs naturally" if you call.  Inorganic arsenic is a know carcinogen and shouldn't be in anything labeled organic.  Earth's Best rice baby cereal had the highest arsenic content of three brands tested.  However, when I called them, I was disappointed by their lack of accountability and misleading information they provided, especially because their marketing (see above) goes on at length about the health benefits of organic, pesticide free products.  They continue to claim that the product is safe, that arsenic occurs naturally, and they don't apply pesticides.  However, they cover up the fact that the inorganic arsenic in question is not "naturally occurring," it is pesticide-derived and likely comes from pesticide residue in the soil.  I asked if they planned to do testing of their own, implement safety measures and provide refunds to customers who choose not to poison their baby, but they said no.  My opinion is that this "organic" product that is supposedly grown "without harmful pesticides" should be recalled and relabeled until they can show that it's arsenic-free.  If you are buying this by the case and feeding it frequently to your baby, you may be unintentionally poisoning them.

review/summary: 2nd BEWARE - Baby Had BAD Reactions to this Food
review/text: Our 6-month old had been eating rice cereal for 2 months when our order of Earth's Best Rice Cereal from Amazon arrived.  He has not had any major illnesses in the past.  Upon his first feeding of this product, he became ill (vomited).  We tried feeding him cereal again in an hour, and he vomited profusely- drawing a fever.  After a visit to the pediatrician, we were told he had a "virus" (code for, "we don't know what it is").<br /><br />We switched him back to breast milk for the next 2 weeks, expecting his tummy couldn't handle cereal while he had a virus.  The fever itself had passed the same day as his vomiting.<br /><br />Fast forward to last night- all is well and we attempt to feed him a small bit of the Earth's Best Rice Cereal.  He began to vomit profusely to the point where we had to rush him to the emergency room for fear of dehydration (we were told he needed an IV).  He had a fever and was extremely pale and floppy.  We were scared.<br /><br />After 3 hours in the emergency room (waiting) we were able to breastfeed him and he kept it down with no trouble; color returned; no fever; he's back to his old self.  Doctor wasn't sure WHAT was going on (virus or otherwise).<br /><br />We realized that the ONLY three times he got this sick was when he ate this cereal.  He is not allergic to any of the ingredients on this box.  He is fine now and we've contacted Amazon about this.  They claim they may pull this product.

review/summary: A Really Great K-Cup for a Dark Roast
review/text: I really like (not love) this k-cup, but only due to preference of medium roasts over dark roasts.  I really like having some of this blend on hand for variety when I want a dark roast with very strong flavor.  Within the Barista Prima line, I absolutely love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLILAW">Barista Prima House Blend</a>, and love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLIL6Q">Barista Prima Colombia</a> which are more medium or medium-dark.  But for a complex, well blended dark roast, this is excellent.<br /><br />I agree with their text that states a more complex flavor.  The claim is that this is a premium line for those who expect a premium coffee more like a coffee shop.  I tend to agree, except you just don't get as much per cup.  The italian blend is a stronger flavor, but not quite as burnt as a very dark french roast can be (not having tried the Barista Prima French Roast yet but comparing to french roasts in general).  To me, no specific note stands out other than a strong coffee or maybe being a little more bitter.<br /><br />What is nice about K-cups is you can easy switch blends per cup or over time without having to exhaust a whole bag of beans or grounds before moving on.  And preferences change as you have the same day in and day out.  I certainly don't like to have dark blends constantly (but many do).  But what I can say is that when I do, I think this one is great.  I prefer variety and usually have House Blend in the morning, and a Colombia blend in the afternoon.  On more rare occasions, I'll have this roast when I feel like a dark roast with very strong flavor.  I prefer this over another somewhat similar <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004772PJG">Green Mountain Espresso Blend</a> which is more bitter and seems to hurt my stomach occasionally however quite good.<br /><br />The Barista Prima tends to be more expensive, and depending on the sale price, can be only a little more expensive than other varieties.  For a little bit more, it is worth it to me.  For a lot more, maybe not.  Paying about 12% more yields about 30% more in value in flavor to me.  But paying 50% more is costly when there other flavors are plenty good too.

review/summary: Best Mustard There Is
review/text: Annie's Naturals Mustard is the only mustard I have found without any potential form of Monosodium Glutamate. All of the other mustards I have used contained the word "spices." Since the term "spices" can legally have a very broad meaning, I vowed to stay away from it. Luckily I found Annie's.<br /><br />While the size is awkward at first, it is easy to adjust to. Annie's is thicker than the average mustard, but all it takes is a spoon to dig the rest out.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, it is slightly stronger than other mustards I have tried. It is hard to explain, but it tastes much more like a pure mustard than the tamer ones out there.<br /><br />Combine all of that with the USDA Organic label and I am sold. This is a must buy.

All the stores here carry Baker's and the store brands, which are far inferior compared to the Mounds Coconut. Soft, sweet, doesn't clump into hard little balls (I keep mine in the freezer to keep it fresh longer). Over all others I have tried, this reigns supreme!!

review/text: I love chai teas, but most chai mixes out there are pretty high in calories and fat.  I had seen this in a cookbook and decided to try it, and it's really great!<br /><br />So far I've tried it in oatmeal, as chai tea, and even in smoothies.  It tastes great and mixes right into to whatever you put it in.<br /><br />Here is the nutritional info for it:<br /><br />2TB (1 serving size) = 60 calories, 2.5 grams of fat, 90 mg of sodium, 0 mg cholesterol, 11 grams of carbs, 0 grams of fiber, 2 grams of sugar, and 1 gram of protein.<br /><br />To make chai teas or lattes, you need 2 TB of the mix.<br /><br />The only negative is that this is pretty pricey for such a small bag that only has 10 servings total in it.  Overall, though, it's a healthier way to enjoy chai.

review/text: Unless you're allergic and your tongue feels like it just brushed a cactus, I don't know anyone who dislikes the taste of pineapples.  I actually love to grill my pineapple and have it with grilled chicken or other meats.  The searing brings out its juices and makes it even sweeter - you don't have to grill it for very long.<br /><br />Pineapples are not only a delicious fruit high in various nutrients, but they can also play a role in your skin care regimen.  Pineapples are high in alpha hydroxy acid, a skin cleanser and exfoliant.  The next time you want to give your face a nice cleaning, take a piece of freshly cut pineapple and rub it all over your face in slow circular motions.  Wait 5 minutes and rinse.  Follow up with moisturizer and I guarantee your face will glow and feel nice and taut.

review/summary: A snack, extender or...
review/text: Got to know ramen noodles during a job in Korea several years ago.  Sine that time, I have changed my favorites to the chicken flavors and the roast chicken has a bit extra in that department.

review/summary: Not good, not great
review/text: I tried this flavor today. Its ok, not great, it is different from the regular Chicken flavor and tastes more "real" The broth does have some richness to it. I recommend not adding as much water as stated on the package and instead, add 1 1/4-1 1/2 cups of water( it was a bit bland at 1 and 1/2 cups)as they have put less seasoning in the packet in recent years, Im assuming to save money. It wasnt bad though and Id eat it again, perhaps adding some additional seasonings like a little soy sauce( good in a lot of the flavors) but I didnt like it enough to buy a full 24 pack since it's available at the local grocery store for now. I generally like all the flavors Ive tried though. I recommend this product if you want a soup that tastes just a little better than the regular Chicken flavor or like Ramen in general like I do, it isnt bad tasting at all.

review/summary: Not satisfied
review/text: Since I could not find my favorite After dinner chocolate in this area and the company could not find any stores in this area I ordered it from the Web. Sadly, the chocolate pieces were sticking to the individual wrappers; apparently it had melted somewhere while on a shelf. Since product, together with shipping charges, was expensive I will not order again

review/summary: Why did they add gelatin?!!!
review/text: This was my favorite candy for many years.  It was heaven in a square.  Then some idiot at Nestle decided to put cow hoofs in it (also known as gelatin).  As soon as Nestle makes it vegan again, I will start buying it in bulk.

review/summary: Nestles
review/text: Thanks for the warning on the changes made by Nestles. One by one my favorite foods are being bought by foreign conglomerates. In the case of Nestles Switzerland restricts foreign ownership and to my mind there should be a quid pro quo and countries should ban Swiss companies buying up their companies. Rowntree was a successful company so it was not an issue of them struggling to survive.

review/summary: Sucka for Suckers ! (n__n)
review/text: I am a huge lollipop fanatic and Lollipops are one of my favorite types of candy. I'm not too picky about types or flavors. In my Life I've eaten alot of lollipops. I bought a bag of these a few days ago and LOVED how bold the flavors are. I normally don't like Strawberry flavored anything cuz most tastes horrible but the Strawberry flavored pop in this bag tastes like real strawberry and I like it. It would be nice if they had more flavors than just the Four(4) : Lemon, Pinapple, Grape, and Strawberry but it's definitely thee best Lollipop I've tasted. I could see myself satisfying my sweet craving with a Party Pop anytime. I've even sucked on one or two in between meals to keep me happy til my next meal. Definitely would recommend these to anyone who's looking to giveaway Lollipops in their office or just for yourself. Love these !! Planning to buy more maybe today or tomorrow.

review/summary: Excellent sauce, milder than the green lid
review/text: I was excited to see a new line of Sriracha sauce in my grocery store so I scooped this up the first day I saw it.<br /><br />This sauce is packed with flavor, it is tangy and showcases the flavors of the chili and garlic right out front. It is not as hot as the Huy Fong Sriracha sauce in the green lid and also has a tangier flavor.
