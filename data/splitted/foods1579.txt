review/summary: Great Taste and Great Texture
review/text: In general, licorice is NOT loved by me; however, I bought a bag of this from Whole Foods for a friend and it is now one of my favorite candies. I don't know how RJ does it for I have tried many different "natural" brands, like Darrells and Panda which are good; yet, no others have converted me to a licorice lover until RJ's. Its softer than other brands. I've also tried the other flavors from RJ and they are delicious as well. Yes, its expensive but if you love licorice you are in for a real treat.

review/text: These are so delicious and the chewy texture make it impossible to eat just one. You may swear that this will be your last one, but when that great after taste wears off, you'll be back reaching for that bag. I have convinced myself,after a little research, that these are good for you. So therefore, I am living a healthy lifestyle by eating a bag a week.

review/text: I love good licorice - and believe me it's not all good. My daughter first found RJ's licorice in a local store but they did not always have it. She searched and found it on-line and bought me 8 bags. I ration myself but still run out too fast . Now I go on-line and buy it. It is by far the best licorice I have found. It has a soft chewey texture - just perfect, and the flavor is right on. If you like licorice you have to give this a try.

review/summary: Too soft
review/text: I love black licorice, my first choice is Tire Tread which Amazon doesn't sell any more, second choice is Panda. RJ's is too sweet and too soft. Personal preference I guess, but don't know why it is overly sweet and I think it's way too soft. I must admit that even though this licorice tastes too sugary it has the exact same number of carbohydrates as Panda. If you like soft you'll like it.

The liquorice is soft and chewy (unlike Twizzler's, which sometimes you have to pull apart to eat). Looking back, I can hardly believe how I lived without these in my life. I know these things have sugar and might not be great for my health, but what the heck - it's worth the price!

review/summary: Licorice At Its Best
review/text: Like New Zealand, RJ's Black Soft Natural Eating Licorice is outstanding. I have tried everything from Good & Plenty to Kookaburra Australian Licorice and, by far, RJ's is the best, in individual size, flavor, texture and shelf-life. That is especially true if you prefer soft licorice. I believe that once you try it, you will be hooked, too. I must add, however, that Amazon's website shows a price increase of over $6/4-bags, since I purchased it last month. But, check back with Amazon to see if they have been re-supplied RJ's from their supplier. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5UVK">RJ's Black Soft Natural Eating Licorice, 10.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a>

review/text: I first ran across RJ's abroad, and was thrilled to find Amazon carrying it (by the way, if Amazon is out, there is a US distributor for this product).  This is very good licorice - as others have said, it does take some will power to limit consumption.<br /><br />Also, the company that sells it stands behind their product; I once had some issue with an order; they apologized, and sent me a replacement.  It is (sadly) rare to find a company that knows what customer service is all about that I'm very happy to continue my orders.

review/text: I never liked black licorice and always preferred red or chocolate (!) but I now have a taste for black licorice and all I can say about this is, yes, as another reviewer said, this stuff is addictive and wonderful.  It's great to eat for a treat but no one should be eating this for dinner.  It's too fattening!!  Who wants to be a blimp??!!  Not me.  So I bought 4 bags and knocked off one immediatly, gave away two to very grateful people and have one more hidden in a closet and so far it's been there for a few weeks and I don't dare to open it because it'll be gone in 2 days and I'll be 3 pounds heavier.  Yes, somehow a 10.5-ounce bag of goodies will result in more than a 10.5-ounce weight gain!!<br /><br />FABULOUS LICORICE!!!

We returned home and found RJ's of New Zealand here on Amazon and ordered it along with some other brands of licorice and it took about 2 weeks with the free shipping but it was worth it. Give it a RJ's a try as well as some others licorice sold here on Amazon and I'm sure you will delight in them as we do.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious--- and potentially very dangerous too
review/text: I was enjoying some of this yummy licorice just now while at the computer, my first experience with RJ's. I became curious about the medicinal applications of licorice and searched "licorice health". I was stunned to find that licorice root and extract are implicated in a number of potentially serious health problems: hypertension, potassium depletion, heart and kidney failure,  fluid retention and swelling of the face and limbs, hormonal imbalance, and muscle destruction leading to pain and weakness. Licorice can reduce thyroid gland activity and lower basal metabolic rate. Pregnant women should avoid licorice because of danger to the fetus. From the "People's Pharmacy" web site:<br /><br />"It appears that individuals vary considerably in their susceptibility to adverse reactions from licorice. Some people experience negative symptoms within days, while others may ingest excessive licorice in candy, chewing gum, chewing tobacco, or herbal medicine for months or even years before they realize that they are suffering damaging effects. Women appear to be somewhat more susceptible than men, and oral contraceptives may increase this sensitivity.<br /><br />Paralysis of the legs (and in one case, of all of the limbs) has been reported. A sixty-four-year-old man developed pulmonary edema, signaled by fatigue and trouble breathing, after eating four packages of black Twizzlers licorice candy in three days. This case demonstrates how quickly a serious reaction can arise."<br /><br />Interestingly, most licorice candy sold in the US is made with anise, not licorice flavoring. RJ's however is made from licorice extract... tasty but not worth the risk to me personally as one with a family history of circulatory disorders. Be aware.

review/summary: horrible!  DO NOT ORDER this "SAFFRON"!
review/text: HORRIBLE!  The actual so-called "Pure Spanish Saffron" is, in my opinion NOT what it is claimed to be, and certainly NOT AT ALL AS PICTURED! (And certainly not at all like the beautiful golden saffron threads I have purchased from other sources in the past.)<br />Instead, it resembles a red bark, shaved and chopped.  When placed into water to see how it affects the color, the water becomes RED, rather than GOLDEN.<br />INTERESTINGLY?  They scrawled a handwritten note on the back of scrap paper:<br />"Thank you for your purchase. This month we also have promotion of if you buy 5 gr Spanish Saffron we give away 10 gr of ground Turkish Saffron.  If you like it please order it next time. Thank you. Marshall Books"<br />The ground Turkish Saffron is golden in color. BUT it seems to me that this indicates that Marshall Books KNOWS they are ripping customers off with this "saffron" and try to assuage their guilt by this "give away".<br />That, my friends, is the true "dead give-away" that this product is NOT what it is claimed to be.<br />Therefore, I claim, "FRAUD!  I want my money REFUNDED!"

review/summary: Strengthen digestive system. Balance Vata.
review/text: I'm a Vata with weak digestive system. After following ayurveda lifestyles, I found Yogi Tea's Classic India Spice be the best herbal tea I can find to replace the vata balance herbs. I drink daily to help my  system digest animal protein easier. In cold windy or stressful days, the tea helps to calm me down. The quality of Yogi Tea's ingredients are incredible; my body proves it to be ture, since not all herbal tea can achieve the same effect. Whenever I don't have ginger handy, this tea is my life saver!

review/text: I quit drinking coffee and looked for something to take its place - I found it!  I drink this tea at least two times a day.  As a dessert tea I add a tiny amount of stevia and skim milk - it is very very yummy!  My husband who also gave up coffee drinks this tea everyday.  We love that it has a little bit to it.  I can't tell you how many people walk by my desk at different times of the day asking what that wonderful smell is - I give them a bag to try and they are hooked!  Please do not change the ingredients - it is perfect!  Oh with all that said - this is the best price I have found!!!

review/summary: From Good Tea (old style) to Strange Tea (this style).
review/text: This "newer" Yogi product is very different from their old mix and is a big disappointment.  (To me). It's hard to describe the flavor in what I got, but there is a distinct taste of something like the odor of fresh, moist dirt.  I don't know if they got some tea from a different source, or what.  The ingredients of both are identical.  But this one is definitely unpleasant.  I make sun tea with it almost exclusively.  Their old style came in a maroon bag with a yellow square on it, and said "Yogi Tea" instead of just "Yogi".  And, silly me, I bought a bunch of this thinking I would get exactly what I like and was used to.  So, I'm sending this shipment back and going with the licorice and the ginger.  So don't buy a large quantity like I did until it meets your expectations.  My bad!

review/summary: Awesome Tea
review/text: It's a nice, spicy tea.  The predominant flavor is cinnamon.  It probably has some black pepper in it too... but don't let mislead you... it simply enhances the sweetness.  Really opens you up when you have a head cold/sinus infection.  I've been buying it locally, but the price was getting to be too much.  Buying in bulk, more much worth it... not like it's going to go bad.

review/summary: I LOVE YOGI TEA!
review/text: Up until just recently I have always been a dedicated coffee drinker, with an occasional side trip into good English teas. My recent experiences with "herbal teas" (mostly chamomiles, endured at the homes of some of my beloved but slightly flakey friends) were beyond nasty. It would go like this: accept one cup, try not to inhale the smell, smile, nod, sip the tea and eat 8 cookies to cover up the taste. Another cup? Sure, pass the cookies!<br /><br />Then I was introduced to Yogi teas. Who knew herbal tea could taste and smell so delicious?? So far I have enjoyed the Yogi Bedtime, Yogi Sweet Thai Delight, and most especially this Classic India Spice. India Spice has a certain heat to it, a rich peppery note, that even my husband likes! We add milk and sugar - fab!<br /><br />My next purchase will be Yogi Healthy Fasting -- to help me get rid of all those cookies.

review/summary: zippy and sweet
review/text: I am rather new to the world of tea (few years), but am rapidly growing accustomed to having a few cups a day.  This is probably among the most aromatic teas I have ever consumed.  After making a cup, the house smells of cinnamon and spice.  The flavor is also great.  Some folks comment on sweetening it with splenda or stevia, but I find that it actually has a sweet finish (particularly the last few sips of each cup).  I'm not sure I'll buy this one regularly, but its certainly nice to add to the mix in the cabinet.<br /><br />If you don't appreciate spice, then this tea is probably not for you.  But, its by no means spicy to result in burning (like some spicy foods)... its just an emphasis.  Also, know that much of the spice flavor this tea provides is from the oils used in the tea rather than the tea itself.  This is the first tea I have had with oils listed in the ingredients.  That sort of removed a bit of originality for me personally.  I would rather have a tea without added flavor via oils.

review/summary: saved me and puppy from being in the doghouse
review/text: Earlier today I was on the phone with my sister and the new puppy I bought her for Christmas decided to make and unplanned and unauthorized solid deposit on her wool rug. Since my gift had now left her a "gift" I felt pretty bad about the rug. She was very gracious about the matter though. While we were still on the line, I was surprised how quickly she was able to clean up the mess, *so* quickly I had to ask just HOW she had managed to do so. She said it was this Rescue Clean Sweep Accident Absorbent, a product I had never heard of. I have both a cat and a dog so this definitely interested me and I asked a few more questions.<br /><br />It's made of a single ingredient - perlite which is a natural, highly absorbent substance, widely used in the gardening industry. It's the little white granules you see in potting soil; it's in there because it absorbs water readily and then can return it back to the plant as needed when the soil becomes dry. By nature it can absorb the moisture from both wet and solid pet messes and make it easy to just sweep it up into a dustpan. It works quickly and within just a few minutes while we chatted on the phone she was able to get the entire mess off the rug.<br /><br />I'm glad she found this product and also glad she told me about it because after hearing how well this product works I think it's definitely one of those things for me to keep in the cleaning cupboard for "just in case".

review/summary: Has the excellent flavor all Bakto extracts have
review/text: I use A LOT of vanilla. Most vanilla contains sugar, and I cannot eat sugar. So I've been on a perpetual search for high quality but not exorbitantly priced vanilla that doesn't contain sugar. Bakto pure vanilla qualifies in the "high quality" category. To my thinking it's a bit overpriced, but admittedly is not out of line with what is being charged these days for good, pure vanilla extract. (That said, because I use so much vanilla and good commercial vanilla is costly, I've taken to mostly making my own. But that's another story....)<br /><br />I would add that other Bakto extracts I've tried are also excellent in terms of quality. (I especially like their coffee extract. Amazing, intense flavor, just as such things should taste.)

review/summary: Broken Top
review/text: The very first time I tried to use this vanilla the bottle top broke in my hands. Now I have to "close" it with plastic wrap. Additionally, as the top broke I don't know if originally there was some kind of pour spout to aid in the pouring out of the extract, but as I have nothing, every time I try and use it-it ends up just slopping all over my counter. Now, the flavor itself (and the smell!) are wonderful. However, I'm still so mad about the top breaking and not having any sort of pour spout that I probably will not buy again. And perhaps my palette just isn't developed enough, but I wouldn't say I really notice a huge difference between this and something bought at the grocery (except for the scent, which really is heavenly).

review/summary: Best noodles out there!
review/text: I love these noodles.  Unlike the traditional instant noodles that consist of a fried noodle you add hot water to, these are already hydrated and not fried or dehydrated.  Seems more filling and the flavor packets are delicious!

I forgot to check the salt content before I bought a 6 pack @ Costco. One bowl is 2 servings. Each serving contains 1290 mg (1.29g) of salt. Enough to make your own small ocean (OK I exxagerate). The recommended max salt intake per human per diem is about 2.3g. Surely the flavor could be saved with 1/3 the salt? I wonder if I can return it...?

review/text: Big, crunchy ribbons of coconut that look a little like paper gone through a shredder to give you an idea of the shape. While not very substantial, these are very tasty little morsels. They are very flavorful (coconutty, of course) and just slightly sweet. Fun to munch on, though I do wish there was more in a bag... a little pricy for single serve, and 2 oz couldn't make for more than that.

review/summary: Danielle Sweet Mango Chips are Simply the Best!
review/text: My wife discovered the Danielle Sweet Mango Chips at a Cost Plus World Market.  I hate to think of the fuel we burned going to every one of their markets in the Seattle area looking for more.<br /><br />The Mango chips are outstanding - intense flavor, good crunch - with the added bonus of being sugar,gluten and preservative free.<br /><br />Having owned a restaurant in Mexico which had a huge mango tree in the patio. I learned how great the naturally ripened fruit really tastes. Most of the mangos we find in markets here are still green and lack the mature, well-developed flavor of tree-ripened fruit. The Danielle Sweet Mango Chips capture the pure essence of ripe mango flavor!<br /><br />We'll be setting up a recurring order with Amazon so that we'll never have to be without our favorite snack.

review/text: I am from a country, where coconuts are the thing. :P we have them on the streets, even on the backyard, pretty much all year long. I am now in the US where a fresh conconut is not the same :(. SO when i saw these chips in the store(TJMax), i was pretty intrigued. I cannot believe how good they are. They taste just like coconut, not overly sweet, but just like a coconut tastes like! I cannot wait to get moreeee!!!

review/text: These are a great gluten free snack!  I eat them alone or add them as a topping on yogurt.  They are crunchy, slightly salty/sweet, not greasy and travel well in a hot car. If you like coconut, I bet you will be a fan of these chips!  Be advised, if you are expecting these to be the size of a potato chip, they aren't.  They are big rectangular shreds about an inch long.

review/text: Danielle coconut chips are the best things ever in life.  I first found them at a airport gift shop on a phoenix layover and I've been addicted ever since.  They carry these at Whole Foods, but the supply is always sketchy and random, so ordering them online in a 6 pack always seems like a good option.<br /><br />Here are the flavors that I really like:<br />1. Coconut - the best ever<br />2. Mango<br />3. Honey Banana<br />4. Tangy Pineapple<br />5. Sweet Potato<br /><br />The okra ones are okay, so are the taro and the durian, I find the jackfruit ones disgusting, the pumpkin ones are gross and the carrot ones are SUPER icky (but I despise carrots, so I may be biased)

review/summary: I've gone Bananas over these Banana Chips!!!!
review/text: My first exposure to these chips was at a local gourmet deli.  I hestitated to purchase them due to the price ($3.25 for a 2 oz bag) but I bought them anyway.  I AM SO GLAD I DID!  These taste nothing like any banana chip I have ever tasted.  They are simply DELICIOUS!!!  The flavor is sweet but non-geasy and the chips have a nice crunch with a light as air puffy texture.  The Ingredients: Just fresh Bananas and palm oil - that's it.  No preservatives - No Trans fat.  The only down side is the price, HOWEVER, if you order them through Amazon's subscription service you will get them at a better price.(you can choose how often you want them delivered).  I couldn't wait to place my order and now I will be receiving them on a regular basis.  TRY them, you won't be dissapointed!

review/summary: Expensive, but good
review/text: It's pretty expensive considering how much chips is actually in the package. But, it tastes great (similar to durian chips I've had in Thailand) & healthy to boot. If you've never tried durian / heard notorious things about the fruit / hated how the actual fruit tasted, fear not! It doesn't taste/smell remotely like the fruit: more like non-oily potato chips with a smooth buttery aftertaste.

review/text: I usually don't like artificial coconut flavored stuff, but this roasted coconut chip is soooo good. I ate the 1 whole bag on my way to work, though I do not recommend doing that. The chips are crispy and sweet, with a strong coconut flavor. I would give the jackfruit one a try if Amazon sells the 6-packs rather than the 20-packs one. In short, if you like coconut in general, or even if you are not a big fan of coconut, give it a try and you will be amazed!!

review/text: If you love coconut, then this is for you.  As a bona fide coco-'nut', I can tell you this product is delicious...crispy and lightly sweet wide flakes.  The drawbacks are that the bag contains a pretty small amount and the pieces are brittle and break.  That being said, the coconut is great for snacking or garnishing desserts/baked goods.

review/text: I first purchased this Danielle product at all places, Marshalls. I was on my way to the movies, and was looking for something to munch on, and somehow found this bag to look appetizing.  I immediately opened in my car to see if I was gonna like this hidden snack before I got all comfy during coming attractions.<br />Oh WOW...I was hooked.  I literally had to force myself to stop eating, and wait until I got to the movies.  It took a lot of restraint, and (I'm a picky foodie when it comes to snacks.)  I enjoyed every little tidbit of Coconut in the bag, and was sad when it was gone.<br />When the movie ended, I googled where I can find this snack, and found out it was only sold in stores in the New York area.  Somehow Marshalls ended up with this product due to some overstock not sold, or in some other capacity.  I hit the Marshalls the next day, and sadly found all the Coconut sold out.  I purchased the Pineapple in hopes it had the same kind of taste the Coconut had, but no...it was horrible.<br />I've been looking high and low for this at other local Marshalls, but no luck.  I finally caved in, and purchased here.  I'm excitedly waiting for my 12 bag order.<br />If you LOVE Coconut as much as I do, you will truly love this snack.  I agree with others, for the price, the bag should have a bit more to enjoy.

I happen to love durian but these have none of the infamous smell. they are nutty, salty, and delicious, tasting more like the boiled durian seed. My only complaint was that the chips were perhaps crushed in transit and very very tiny.

review/text: After buying coconut chips at Trader Joe's and loving them, I had to find more (I don't live near a Trader Joe's). Found these on Amazon and HOPED they would be the same kind of product. Was excited to find out they are! They're basically shaved pieces of coconut that are baked/roasted. Ingredients listed on the bag are fresh coconuts, sugar, and salt. They're delicious and have the perfect crunch! As a bonus, they're a natural treat. I eat them as a snack all by themselves; my toddler loves them too! The six-pack will last us quite a while.

review/text: We're on vacation in Maui and I happened to pick up a bag Danielle's coconut chips from a shave ice vendor down the street. I LOVE coconut but get discouraged by all the over-sugared options. These are WONDERFUL! I have 2-year-old twin boys, and I couldn't get them to stop eating them. I was so eager to get my hands on more that I emailed our local Whole Foods from the beach, only to find out that they don't carry the coconut flavor. I begged them to reconsider - but then I discovered that Amazon carries them, so all my troubles are over. :) Really, if you like coconut, give these a try! (By the way, the mango is delicious, too!)

I've recently introduced them to three different family members who ordered them immediately upon trying them.  The texture and flavor are wonderful...tiny little ribbons of crisp coconut.  And the whole bag is only 250 calories.  Yes, the bag is small, especially for the price, but they are worth it.  I can't recommend these enough.

review/text: We're staying at Stanford's Children's Hospital with my son, and I'm sure I don't have to elaborate how 'pleasant' hospital cafeteria food can be, even at a 'great' cafeteria (as hospital cafeteria's go, Stanford's is actually very good. But it is still cafeteria food). On weekends the Children's side cafeteria closes down so you have to go over to the main hospital's cafeteria for dinner. Grabbed a turkey sandwich and was looking for some chips or something crunchy, and I saw these. I'm a big coconut fan so I figured I couldn't go wrong, and it's healthier than potato chips so I'm game. I made the mistake of trying a bite of them before I had my sandwich, I didn't want to put the bag down! Holy smokes, seriously the best 'chip substitute' I've ever had, and if they weren't so expensive I'd switch over from potato chips completely!! Perfect combination of salty/sweet, loads of coconut flavor (I've had some where it's really subtle and mild, this definitely is not), great size strips (like someone said, looks like they put it through a strip paper shredder just a bit wider), perfect crunchiness. Anyways, definitely a rare treat because of the expense, but so worth every penny! I may have to grab another bag for the road home though before we get discharged this afternoon. ; )

And man oh man...I cannot have a lot of sugar but these are sweet and savory at the same time. They are also rich and so I only eat a little at a time (a difficult task). I have been hiding them from everyone in my house. It's not that difficult as they don't like coconut but when teenagers get desparate...all bets are off.<br /><br />Definitely purchase this item. I have also tasted other items by this vendor and all were fabulous. Definitely worth the cost!
