review/summary: Great healthy mix...
review/text: I was looking for a good mix without alot of candy coated junk mixed into it and this one does the trick. Like the other reviewer says, there are alot of peanuts and raisins, but there are plenty of cranberries & almonds in that mix as well. I would say cashews and the yogurt covered raisins (about 15 per package) are what there are the fewest of. For me that's great because im trying to lose weight but i still like the addition of a few yogurt raisins too.<br /><br />All in all 5 stars from me, you wont find a better healthy mix for around $2.50 a bag. If you get melted yogurt raisins from a hot summer delivery, just stick the entire bundled pack in the freezer when you get the package for 30-45 minutes, they come out just like new without damage to nuts.

review/text: I was looking for a varied mix without the candy/chocolate because it would melt at camp. This stuff is awesome. It satisfies my cravings for salt and sugar, for chewy and crunchy. I eat it for lunch with a banana or a snack after dinner. Helps me feel healthy. Gives me sustained energy.

review/summary: Good ol' raisins and peanuts, but very little else.
review/text: If what you are looking for is raisins and peanuts, the Emerald Hartmony Raisinberry Nut trail mix is fine. There are plenty of good quality peanuts and raisins in each package (9 oz.). But don't buy this if you really want cranberries, almonds or cashews, because there are very few of these treats. The yogurt covered raisins are very sweet. My carton was delivered on a sunny September day and when I opened the psckage 90 minutes after taking the carton out of the sun, the yogurt raisins were still melted.

review/summary: A Wonderful Sweet Cornbread Mix
review/text: As those reared in the South know, there are different kinds of cornmeal and different ways it can be prepared.  My granny used to fry up cornmeal biscuit-style in a cast iron skillet half filled with grease.  It was faintly salty and went perfectly with fried fish or chicken (or really just about anything she cooked.  Granny was a kitchen wonder.)<br /><br />This Jiffy Cornbread mix produces something entirely different.  It's sweet, almost like a grainy cake mix... and my family loves it.<br /><br />I usually make corn muffins with it, although on occasion I'll make Johnny Cakes for them for breakfast.  (These are like pancakes, no syrup though --at least not in our household as the little critters don't need any more sugar -- but melted butter or a fruit compote, finish them off perfectly.)<br /><br />To make the mix, all you need is one egg per box and a small amount of milk.  The recipe calls for 1/3 cup, but years of making this has taught me that the proper amount can vary a great deal.  The proper consistency should not be stiff, but not runny either.  It should flow slowly when the mixing bowl is tilted.<br /><br />A fun and convenient product.  You can be eating in under about 15 minutes.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger

review/text: My husband and I love Coach's Oats.  We first tried them on recommendation by a friend.  They are kind of nutty and rich in flavor.  The oat is not rolled, not quite cracked, but somewhere in between. They have a great texture.  They take about 5 minutes to cook.  We first bought them at Costco, now they don't carry them anymore and we can't find them anywhere.  We would like to order them online, but don't want to dish out shipping charges.  Hoping that Amazon starts carrying them soon.

review/summary: Healthy, tasty, and versatile!
review/text: This is my first review ever on Amazon, but this product deserves attention. I have eaten this product for 5-7 days a week for an entire year now.  The only time I didn't eat it was when I was on vacation.  Even then, I began to miss it after a week.  This product is amazing, and I've yet to tire of it.  Don't get me wrong, nothing can replace hashbrowns for breakfast in the morning in terms of flavor, but this product has helped me get into the best shape of my life while still enjoying the food I eat.<br /><br />The versatility of this product is amazing.  If I want a porridge consistency, I add slightly more water. If I want a bowl of something with more chew to it I add slightly less water. If I'm extra hungry , I'll cook it on the stovetop with frozen veggies (carrots, peas, corn, broccoli, etc) with some garlic salt and hot sauce and you've got a savory and healthy dinner. If I'm in the mood for something sweet, I'll add bananas and drizzle in some honey. A bowl of this with an over-easy egg and you've got a very filling snack under 250 calories. With a regular meal, I'll sub out my starch (rice, pasta, bread) with this oatmeal for a healthy alternative. For me, I feel more full with oatmeal as the side dish probably because it fools my stomach with extra water weight but the fiber content keeps me feeling full or at least content until the next meal.<br /><br />Think outside the box and be open to new flavors and new textures, and you will thoroughly enjoy this product as much as I have, AND feel healthy doing so :)

review/text: Having only eaten instant oatmeal, I was looking for a whole grain oatmeal that would offer more health benefits. I came Coach's Oats at Costco and I'm glad I did. Easy and quick to cook. It tastes good enough on it's own, but I usually add a banana, raisins, berries or dried fruit. It also makes a healthy and filling snack - adding a bit to yogurt or sprinkling it on other foods. Sometimes I'll even eat a tablespoon or so dry or with a half teaspoon of jam or jelly. I'm going to use this to make some super healthy snack bars (there are many recipes online) to replace the sugar-laden and expensive granola bars or energy bars I usually buy.

review/text: The best oatmeal there is!  Great texture and cooks up nicely in the microwave.  here is what I do.  I eat for breakfast at work.  typically I put it in a microwave save bowl, put it hot water from the water cooler, turn the microwave to 3 minutes at 20% power (ours is 1000 watts max), and voila! it's ready. Typically I stir for 10 seconds to get the texture just right.  Then, I add 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and just a drop of soy sauce.  I don't add sugary stuff like brown sugar or any kind of fruit  (whole wheat or not, this is already full of carbs).<br />This should be available everywhere.

review/summary: First Amazon Review...so it's got to be good!!
review/text: First time I have ever reviewed a product at Amazon. My wife, who is always one step ahead of me, bought a bag at Costco. I like Oatmeal but it can be mushy and unappealing after awhile...plus it does take long to make. I try to stay away from the small packages that are flavored and full of fake flavors and probably sugar. This oatmeal is different. It takes only 4 minutes to make a big bowl and the texture is amazing. I dump a bunch of blueberries in it and even leave out any milk...and it's filling and tasty. This morning I added some nutmeg and cinnamon and it's even better. Filing too. Healthy breakfasts are always a challenge so this is great!!!

review/text: I have eaten oatmeal for years and found Coaches Oats 3 years ago.  It's now the ONLY oatmeal I'll eat! Since the oats are cracked rather than rolled, they have a slight crunch and definitely more texture.  Regular oatmeal is just too blah.  The Kona Costco still has Coaches Oats, but I haven't been able to find it at Costco's on the mainland.  Now that Amazon carries Coaches Oats, I'll never be without!

review/summary: OATS THAT ROCK!
review/text: I have to tell you all this one is the best I've tasted. Seen this at Costco one day a month ago. I only had purchased one 4.5 lb bag. I had like it so much I had gone back for more. Although cheaper than Amazon, I still buy it off Amazon. Since Costco doesn't carry them again. I just placed in another order and he had arrived quick!. When I first did a order the Oats was shipped Next Air via Las Vegas. That's real good service from Amazon. As for this product you can't compare it with anything you buy at Whole Foods nor regular Oatmeal.<br /><br />I've prepare this produce on the store and in two different type of Steamers. I don't use water method. I only use Silk or Blue Diamond Almond Milk Original on both. I use also Honey from local Farm which I wish Amazon would carry. You really don't have to use Honey but I like it so I use it. I set this to cook for 15 minutes in a Steam Oven I got from Amazon. I also have BPA Steamer I also got from Amazon. That one 11L  I can place 3x glass bowls (pyrex type) In the steamer with water only 3x can be cooked in 20 minutes. In Oven Steamer it's about 15 minutes with the Conventional Fan going. On the store using Ceramic cookware cooks pretty fast though. I like the steamer better because you get the puff of hot steam and the oats taste just right.<br /><br />I have bowl of this Oats every morning and look forward to the next day to have it! Also clay soup pots can be also use with handles. Pick up one of these bags and try it for yourselves. You won't be without another bag in your home. You'll be hooked like my family is!

review/summary: Toast in a dry skillet; make with coffee and cream
review/text: Coach's Oats' patented procedures produce some very well-textured oatmeal--the best I've had.<br /><br />Here's my method of preparing them:<br />Toast ~1.5 Cups raw Coach's Oats in a dry stainless-steel medium pot. Add ~3/4 tsp of Kosher Salt.<br />Add 3 Tbsp of Coconut Oil and/or Macadamia Oil and/or Butter. Stir until toasted and brown.<br />In a separate container, microwave 3 cups of water and 1 cup of black coffee to a boil (4 cups total).<br />Pour the boiling liquid over the oats in the hot cooking vessel. Instant violent boil. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes.<br />Remove lid and stir in cinnamon (e.g. cassia) and ~4 Tbsp Orange Blossom Honey.<br />Simmer uncovered for ~4 more minutes until desired texture consistency is reached. I like mine on the drier side.<br />Serve with a splash of cream and/or berries. Or anything that will stand up to the coffee flavor. Have fun.

A good 20-30 minutes full boil in a stove top pan to cook these types.<br /><br />I also like Irish 5 minute version steel cut when I'm out of coaches oats, Irish 5 minute are not as good and are a smaller grain ; Coaches are nuttier more flavor packed and a few minutes less cooking time.<br /><br />Irish 5 minute steel cut are around 5-9 minutes microwave<br />Coaches Steel Oats are around 3-5 microwave<br />Irish regular Steel cut 30 minutes stove-top full boil<br /><br />Coaches are a nice balanced oat , like Irish steel cut , but more flavor because of the patented process which brings out a nuttier mouth satisfying flavor.<br /><br />Our local Costco doesn't have them anymore?!!<br /><br />WHY I don't know so I'm forced to order online here or at the main website for Coaches Oats.<br /><br />By far Coaches are my fav oatmeal, even with ample time to cook I'd go for the Coaches Oats every-time.

It's nice to know that something so healthy can taste so delicious.<br />Sandra Bennett, Atlanta, GA

review/summary: Hate oatmeal, but love this stuff!
review/text: I am a health & fitness coach who helps people get healthy online for free, and one of my customers was praising Coach's Oats, so I had to try it.  I do NOT like oatmeal.  I can't stand the mushy texture, and whenever I have eaten it in the past, it was strictly for nutrition's sake rather than enjoyment.  I LOVE this stuff - it has a steel-cut texture but is ready in 5 minutes instead of 500 like steel-cut (&lt;--slight exaggeration).  Such a great flavor & texture - I'm a customer for life!

review/text: Bought this in the Maui Costco and thought it tasted so great we dragged home the unfinished huge bag of oatmeal.  Went to our local Costco and they did not sell it but another type of cut oatmeal which is not nearly as good and a different texture.  This is a fine tasting healthy oatmeal.

review/text: Finding great tasting steel oats that cook as quickly as processed oatmeal is not easy to do. These oats can even be microwaved and never get gummy. I originally found these in California while visiting family and could not find them in Virginia when I returned home. You have to purchase two big bags minimum when getting them from the Internet,  and they are big bags, but I intend to share one with friends.

review/text: This oatmeal tastes great, and it has nice texture because it's steel cut. It's healthier and contains more fiber then regular mushy oatmeal. It's extremely good for you and the texture is amazing but still - it has no taste. Some people say that it has a"nutty taste" but to me- it has no taste at all. However I cut a banana, and put a little sweetener and voila! - delish! I am now addicted to this oatmeal!

review/summary: Best cherry soda I have ever had
review/text: Another delicious old fashioned Boylan Bottleworks flavor of soda. I say old fashioned because they are a 100 year plus company that makes their sodas the way that everyone made them before they changed all the ingrediants in the 1970's. Their Black Cherry's deep flavor comes from a blend of different cherries along with other high class ingredients here. This is the only cherry soda I know that uses only a mix of pure natural black cherries for the flavor, no other fruit juices or artificial flavors mixed in to save money. As a result the cherry really does taste like cherry rather than a syrupy mess that has a hint of cherry. It has an authentic tart cherry mixed in the sweet, and you can taste the tart in the aftertaste. It even has a nice texture in the mouth. I know this sounds gushy but you have to try it!<br /><br />But it gets better, they used real cane sugar instead of the cheaper high fructose corn syrup that is used in all the big brand sodas. As a result the sweet is more clean, not as overpowering or syrupy. The carbonation is medium, again here is an issue of too much carbonation can detract from the flavor. Caffeine free. The bottle is very cool and nostalgic with a painted on label and raised letters on the glass, reminding you they have been in business since 1891. All in all a perfect black cherry soda, best I have ever had.

review/text: This is a great fruit soda, will surprise you if you are used to artificially flavored junk.<br /><br />BUT... It's much cheaper in supermarkets. Trader Joe's, as noted above, sells it for under $3 in a four-pack.<br /><br />There also exists an all-natural version without the preservative or artificial colors, that is sold in Whole Foods. Side by side it tastes a little better, but is more expensive. I prefer it.

review/summary: 41/2*  Working Guy's Cherry Soda
review/text: "Boylan Bottleworks"<br /><br />AS a charter member of "Free Associators Anonymous," the company name is ripe with conotation: Pittsburgh. Giant pipes of metal and glass with sweaty workers downing a "Boylans" (or, shorter, sweeter: "Hey, Trow Me a 'Boys'!"  Ironworks, manholes made in Oakland, tough immigrants, and cherries blacker than coal. Coupled with The Bottle Americana, even a non-serious soda flavor like cherry has a certain gravitas, a don't-screw-with-me style, even though I'm rich enough to afford this.<br /><br />Speaking of serious, let's get on with the parlor game of tasting notes. Boylan's Black Cherry, as noted by others, isn't too sweet (cloying as the wine connosieurs will tell you), syrupy, and it tastes like cherries, especially upon entry and in a very satisfying aftertaste. However, a grape/apple flavor sneaks in under all this, so much so that I was surprised that Boylan uses cherry juice only.  It keeps Boylan's from perfection, just as the Amazon price may give you pause.  (Trader Joe's does it again--will this company ever do an IPO so that we can all get rich off its well-deserved popularity.<br /><br />Back to Boylan again.  It's strong enough to stand up to ice, the fizz is moderate--you don't lose half your cherries to foam--and it's quite tasty and refreshing. Again, the only minor problem I had was the perception of a grape juice filler, perhaps my imagination, or perhaps a characteristic of one of the varietals in Boyland's cherry blend. The competition is from other designer sodas (Kemper's, for example), and from cherry sodas made with the artificial flavors and colors that we all grew up to love. At this price, it's a treat, and the taste is so good it'll disappear quickly, but you're a working man or woman. You deserve this liquid luxury presented with no-nonsense attitude.

review/summary: Fantastic soda, great taste, just needs a little more fizz for me.
review/text: I tried this for the first time recently and found it to be simply fantastic.  Ever since the early 1990's I have looked for a replacement for my old standby, black cherry flavored Clearly Canadian that has long since disappeared.  This is by far the closest I have found and in the flavor department, this stuff is much better; no lack of cherry here.  The only wish I have is that it had a little more fizz.  While it is a little pricey here, the cost does include shipping, which is undoubtedly expensive for such a heavy and bulky item.  For those of us without a Trader Joe's around, this is a great way to get your hands on this wonderful drink.

review/summary: Best soda I've had
review/text: My experience with soft drinks has been mostly limited to the major brands so this was quite a change---these sodas have a much cleaner( less chemical)and therefore more refreshing taste than the Coke/7up/Canada Dry variety.  The cane sugar and glass bottles seem to make all the difference( although I still prefer Canada Dry to Boylan's Ginger Ale).<br />$3.25 per 12 oz. bottle is a bit steep. I would check your local specialty markets to see if they carry this; unfortunately, the nearby Trader Joes dropped this product so I'll have to check Gelson's or Whole Foods.

review/summary: You Ladies Don't Get It
review/text: Come on now, how much of this stuff actually DOES taste and smell good to adults.  The last time I bought it at Safeway, it tasted and smelled exactly the same--it's not Amazon's fault that grown-ups would rather eat pot roast with potatoes and gravy on the side.  So, if you don't like it, fire up the blender, and whizz up your unseasoned hunk of meat (which is why it smells so intolerable to our tastes and smells,btw) into a goopy smelly jelly (very much like the jar you're commenting on here). Walk through the market trying to convince your other kids to keep their hands inside the basket everyone's riding in, you stand in line at the end of the day with your feet killing you in those do-me heels guarding the gum and chocolate bars from the other day-care escapees (now busily reaching OUTside the basket for the gum and chocolate), and then embarassingly survive (you hope) the wet (or otherwise and getting smelly) diaper aroma.  Now, pay more for it than at Amazon,lug it all home while balancing tons of paper towels on your head (vs. waiting for the nice-looking UPS guy to set it inside the door where all you have to do is open it and put it on the shelf.)<br /><br />I like shopping in the quiet of my cleaned up kitchen after everyone's gone to bed, paying less for it (with a Prime Membership), and just putting it away when it arrives two days later.  I think that's what we're supposed to be rating and commenting on.  This works for me and rates five stars.

The clear nylon tea bags that both brands use let you easily compare the quality difference -- whereas revolution uses long whole tea leaves, lipton uses little flakes and particles.  If you're willing to commit to 6 boxes of this tea you can buy it here on amazon for about half of what you'd pay on revolution tea's website!

I keep a box at work and brew it in a cup and it tastes just fine, but it really does taste better when brewed in a cast iron teapot and sipped from a small cast iron cup. The teapot and cups are enameled on the inside so it must be a temperature thing because the tea never touches the iron. I have tried it with honey but usually just drink it plain.<br />There are other ingredients besides green tea, mostly natural, plus "pineapple flavor" whatever that is. Good-tasting green tea is rare, so I ordered half a dozen boxes myself and enjoy it whenever I get a chance.

review/summary: A Truly Well-Balanced Green Tea
review/text: For those of you wanting a high-quality, yet affordable green tea, you should definitely give this one a try. Let me first start by saying that everyone is looking for something different for their ideal tea, and I will attempt to briefly highlight what makes this tea attractive to a wide range of tea drinkers (whether you are a beginner or long-time tea enthusiast).  I have gone through over 12 boxes of this tea myself, and highly recommend it for the following reasons:<br /><br />-Quality:  First, this tea offers a smooth quality without any harsh or bitter after tones, which often turns people off from many green teas.  I've found my ideal brewing time to be between 3-5 minutes, giving you a light but flavorful cup of tea.  However, if you get distracted or forget about your tea and leave it brewing for 20+ minutes like I sometimes do, the quality of this tea is such that you still get a smooth but deeper flavor without the bad after taste.  The leaves themselves are whole leaves (not powdered stems, branches, etc commonly found in other brands), and the high-quality nylon bags also include chunks of tropical fruit and other discernible ingredients.  This isn't your standard cheap paper bag with a mix of unknown ingredients that have been ground down to a fine powder, leaving you to wonder what it is you are actually drinking.<br /><br />-Taste:  This tea offers notes of real pineapple and other hints of tropical fruits, yet isn't sweet or artificially flavored.  You have the foundation of a high-quality young hyson green tea for those true "tea flavor" lovers, yet the subtle hints of fruit make this a truly unique tea that I believe most will enjoy.  If you want it sweet, you can add sugar, splenda, etc but this really is not necessary as this tea offers an inherent warmth of flavor through it's ingredients.<br /><br />-Price:  This tea offers an excellent product at an exceptional price (especially when purchased at the prices Amazon offers).  Compared to other brands which I believe to be of similar quality (Mighty Leaf, Rishi, Two Leaves, etc.), Revolution offers a superior product at an outstanding price.  I have been purchasing this through Amazon for less per box than I would be paying at my local grocery store for Lipton, etc.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful tea that is comparable, and even better than, other teas that are priced much higher.  It offers a well-balanced cup of green tea that I believe many will enjoy.  In terms of taste, quality, and price, I would argue you won't find a better combination that that offered by Revolution's Tropical Green Tea.

review/summary: LOVE this tea!!!
review/text: This is not only one of the best tasting green teas out there, I absolutely swear by it for when you're getting a cold or have one. It works miracles. Everyone in my family got sick this winter & I did for a bit (I didn't have my tea) and then I got it & was better within a couple days. As a mom of 4 that's imperative! My husband got sick several times & I kept telling him to drnk the tea!  The last time he finally listened & ended up not even missing any days at work. He keeps a box for himself at work now. You don't have to be sick tho, it's a great tasting tea...even if you don't like green tea. And the bonus is that it's good for you!

review/text: I must say I love this Tropical Green tea. I really like the nylon bags, therefore I can see the tea leaves. In my opinion it is a smooth tea unlike most green teas.  I initially purchased at a local store and now it's not sold there anymore.  I decided to find it online and Thank goodness Amazon has it.  Hoooray ! Keep up the good work Amazon!

review/summary: Beware - ingredients not just tea!!
review/text: My husband, who never suffers from any allergies, went into anaphylactic shock after consuming this tea.  The ingredients show many other herbs and flowers other than tea and flavoring.  He remembered that his fingertips were itchy seconds after handling the bag.  So if you have never tried this product, handle the bag in your hand for a few minutes before steeping in water.  If your going to have a severe reaction you'll soon see some irritation on your skin.

review/summary: Breakfast Blend - Nothing Special
review/text: Long time Keurig user and lifetime coffee drinker.  Breakfast Blend is for the most part a plain cup of coffee.  Light and smooth, but with a slight bitterness at the end.  I still prefer Donut Shop as a light everyday go to coffee choice, but wanted to try a box of Green Mountain BB.  Probably won't purchase again.  No one in the house has stopped me and said, "thats a great cup of coffee".  It's just plain and blah.  I'll probably struggle to finish the box honestly.

review/summary: Fine, But There's Better Out There
review/text: The Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups are pretty decent.  The main selling point of this product is its price point.  Is it good coffee?  No, not really.  Is it good coffee for 60 cents a cup?  It sure can be.  These K-Cups taste good on both size settings of Keurig machines.<br /><br />I would like to point out though, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Donut Shop</a> brand of K-Cups are sold for the same price.  The Donut Shop coffee is a bit smoother in my opinion, and again, it's only 60 cents a cup.  Either way, the coffee you get won't be great, but it will be good for what you pay for.

review/text: I've purchased K-cups in a variety of blends and have learned that the batch to batch consistency isn't perfect.  But unlike some of the reviews of Green Mountain Breakfast Blend I've never had a bad batch of this blend.  If you enjoy a light roast this one seems perfect to me.  It is  available in both regular and decaf.  And for extra savings you may want to order the 50 count box from Amazon which is only $0.60/cup now.
