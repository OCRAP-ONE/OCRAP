review/summary: Good - but there is better
review/text: If you're like me - you're reading the reviews on all the maple syrups available on amazon...this and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> come up as the most favorably reviewed.<br /><br />I couldn't make up my mind so I ordered both.  Coombs is the winner for us.  Brown Family's was good - but Coombs had a bit stronger of a maple flavor.  Taste is definitely personal - but comparing them side by side with the same pancakes - Coombs had more flavor and next to it, Brown Family didn't seem flavorful at all.  This is still better than all the 'fake' syrups though!  We will finish the bottle, but will be reordering Coombs.

Although I pay about one dollar more for this syrup I am very pleased with its taste and will be buying it on a monthly basis. I perfer the dark amber ( a richer maplely taste). My son likes the medium amber ( not so rich, more milder).

review/summary: Raw for dogs who won't eat frozen raw
review/text: My German Sheperd will not eat the frozen raw patties no matter what brand I try, but he eats all the Stella and Chewy's freeze dried with no hesitation.  I buy in bulk to save money and give him 6-9 freeze dried patties per day.  It has really helped his ear problems since I've incorporated this into his diet.  He no longer needs ear meds or cleaners and he has been staying symptom free.  I have tried so many different frozen paties -- different brands different proteins.  He had no interest in the frozen stuff no matter what tricks I tried, but there has never been a problem with getting him to eat the Stella and Chewy's freeze dried. He especially likes the Duck Duck Goose.  My cats like it too.  (I emailed the company. All of their products are for both dogs and cats.)<br /><br />I like that the brand has the organic ingredients, the high meat content, that it's pathogen free (safe), the organs, and mostly that my dog can get a raw meal with those good enzymes each day now.  It's a complete and balanced food,not just a supplement, like some other freeze dried.  It's in his daily diet now that is part of a fresh meat home-cooked diet that I supplement with Wysong Call of the Wild (a powder that is added to fresh meat and that also gives him some raw food ingredredients).  I've found that with a combination of Stella and Chewy's freeze dried raw, fresh cooked meat with Wysong Call of the Wild, cooked wild salmon, a cooked egg most days, sardines, fresh organic fruits and vegetbles and blueberries that my dog, even though he was not receptive to a raw meaty bone diet or a frozen raw commercial diet, is getting nearly optimal nutrition.

It was a real pain having to remember to put it out to thaw the day before and one of my dogs would not eat it at all because it was cold. This is a perfect compromise. No need to defrost and using warm water to rehydrate it makes it more pallatable for my little picky one.

review/summary: My Picky Shiba Inu *Loves* It!
review/text: I have a finicky 10-week old Shiba Inu puppy who was only eating a small amount of her meals. I was feeding her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EGX5SG">Orijen Puppy Formula Dry Dog Food</a>, but she would only eat less than half, if that, of what I put in her plate.<br /><br />At her first vet checkup, my veterinarian told me about STELLA & CHEWY'S RAW FOOD and how she feeds it to her dog so I came on to Amazon to look for it. Of course I found it here and decided on the DUCK DUCK GOOSE FREEZE DRIED formula.<br /><br />The patties are actually quite big, and you can add water to reconstitute it or serve it "as is" to your pup, and they come in a zip-lock top bag for easy closure and storage.<br /><br />Anyway, I crumbled some of STELLA & CHEWY'S FREEZE DRIED and added it to the Orijen kibble, plus a little warm water. I then gave it to Monju and she sniffed it and began eating like there was no tomorrow! She ate everything in the dish and was licking the bowl after. I couldn't believe it and was so relieved to find that she didn't have an eating disorder or something.<br /><br />So I'm sold on STELLA & CHEWY'S and have been giving it to my puppy mixed with kibble for her evening meals. I'll probably switch her full time to just STELLA & CHEWY'S FREEZE DRIED RAW when she gets older, but right now I want her to have something crunchy in her plate.<br /><br />I recommend it if you have fussy and picky eaters at home. And the freeze dried formula is super easy to use, no need to freeze, refrigerate, thaw or any of that.<br /><br />UPDATE 03/08/11<br />For some unknown reason my Shiba stopped liking the "Duck Duck Goose" formula as I got to the bottom of the bag. Maybe it's because she's tried the other flavors or because I've transitioned her to only raw, but she just wouldn't eat this flavor anymore. She loves the "Super Beef" though. Also, now that she just turned 7-months and grown quite a bit, I realized that the patties aren't that big, so keep that in mind if you have a medium to large size dog. My pooch can eat two patties in one sitting and she's not even full grown yet. LOL.

review/text: The label says duck, which would lead you to believe it is duck, not turkey.  Well, unfortunately, it is made with turkey.  Therefore, for animals that can eat duck and NOT turkey, this fails to meet that requirement.  I always give a very low product rating to products that label themselves incorrectly.  If this said "with duck" that would be more honest.  Ordering online,  there's no way to know it contains turkey unless the seller includes that information in the description.

review/text: My 7lb poodle has never been picky about what he is given but since I started this food he won't look at anything else. I can give it to him freeze dried if I am in a hurry, or mix it with water (which is what I do most of the time). He is begging for his food and mad if I take too long. He is eight years old and was starting to show his age but since I started this food 2 months ago his coat is thicker and he seems to have more pep. It is a little pricey but he doesn't eat as much as the traditional dog food. Plus, no more bowel issues (if you know what I mean)! Since all the scares with the overseas dog food problems it is worth the price to me. He did have some kidney issues and I am anxious to see if his blood work has improved with the switch in food.

review/summary: Trail dog's perfect food.
review/text: I Started feeding this food as a topper to my 6 month old imo-inu, trying to supplement more protein and fat safely into her diet.  She's almost 3 years now, and it has become 1/2 her daily intake mixed in with canidae kibble.  Canidae's a great kibble that doesn't cost a whole heck of a lot so thats how i justify paying so much for S & C.<br />I recently (about half a year ago) rescued a catahoula puppy, who is fast becoming my ideal Hiking/Backpacking buddy.  I only fed him canidae until about a month ago. He's now old enough to carry his own food, water and gear, but he can only carry about 7 pounds.  S & C really saves weight in his pack, as I've cut his weight down from 5.5 pounds to under 4.  Two days worth of Stella & Chewy's (39% protein), weighs about 1/2 a pound.  Two days worth of kibble (canidae 24% protein) weighs about 1.75 pounds.  I heard somewhere that competition sled dogs use these because of how little they weigh.  As far as taste, I've never come across a dog who doesn't love this stuff.

review/summary: Rat hair?  Broken glass?  The company doesn't care....
review/text: I thought this product was great, even if maybe it did not seem as pure as more expensive brands.  Then I decided to reuse one of the glass jars after I emptied the salt into a salt shaker today.  After peeling off the label, I realized that the jar had scratches in the glass on the INSIDE of the jar, with the serious potential for having glass particles mixed in with the salt.  I went to the next jar.  It is still safety sealed and unopened.  I peeled off the paper label from the outside of the jar, and inside the sealed jar there is a hair!  It looks like it could be a rat hair, but I have not tested it obviously.  I do hope the FDA will test it--I am contacting them in the morning.  This second jar also has numerous scratches in the glass--approximately 20 scratches, many of them black (dirt in the scratched glass).  The company was not at all concerned--they just told me if I didn't purchase it directly from them, I should ask amazon for a refund.  I explained that the main point of my call was certainly not for a refund but to protect consumers from DANGER!  They called me back and said IF I returned their jars, they would replace the salt.  I refused the replacement and am hoping the FDA will examine the jars.  It is a little alarming that Amazon has no procedure for pulling the salt from its shelves and checking the remaining jars.  The customer service rep at Amazon said she was sorry but unfortunately Amazon waits for a second person to complain before pulling a product.

review/text: This salt is definitely worth the cost.  I sure didn't think so when a buddy gave me a jar of it, but 2 months later the jar is empty and I am fiending for more! Ounce for Ounce this salt is tastier and saltier than average table salt, so you will use less than normal table salt.  It will still end up more expensive, but you will not be disappointed.  As for the rat hair and scratches...I have never seen anything like that.  Great stuff and I not only "Would recommend to a friend" but I do recommend to all of my friends.  Think a 6 pack is too much?  Give a jar to a buddy and share the love, that's how I got hooked!

review/summary: Great Value, Poor Packaging, One Broken Jar
review/text: My naturapath recommends Him. Sea Salts for the trace minerals.  I love that this company puts their salt in a glass jar (1 lb per jar).  However, when my order arrived one jar was broken and I have one pound of sea salt with glass shards mixed in.  What to do with it?  No one offered to send a replacement and I could not easily find out who to contact, and I am otherwise very busy, so I would say the person who did the packaging using the air bags did a sloppy job.  Also the outside of the box was not marked "Fragile, Glass".  Now I'm hesitant to place another order with this company even though their price is great otherwise.  Love the taste of the salt too.  It is  not what is called a real "finishing" salt.  Best used during the cooking process, and choose a finishing salt for the table.  I also add some to the distilled, ozonated water we produce.  It has 84 trace minerals.  Would have given it 5 stars if the packager had been more considerate of what he was packaging.

review/summary: YES! Popchips Nacho Cheese Tortilla!
review/text: In the pre-Popchips days Doritos were one of my favorite chips... I eat chips every day with lunch, now I only eat Popchips. I love the taste and the fact they're much lower in fat than "regular" chips. I eat the 3 ounce potato Popchips bags and now the 3.5 ounce Tortilla bags. These 3.5 oz bags seem to be just slightly less volume than the 3 oz potato bags but both are a satisfying amount. The nutritional values for the Tortilla bags are pretty much the same as the potato (not exact but close). So that said when I saw these brand new tortilla Popchips on Amazon I got excited! Excited over chips? Yes. I immediately ordered a box of the Nacho Cheese with subscription. Today they finally arrived and just in time for lunch. They nailed it! They look like any tortilla chip but a bit more puffy. They are crunchy but slightly more "fluffy" I guess you could say than a regular tortilla chip. The corn tortilla flavor is strong (tastes good) and the nacho cheese flavor tastes pretty much like you'd expect, very similar to nacho cheese Doritos (good!). Basically these taste like a very good tortilla chip or nacho cheese Dorito but without any greasy feeling or taste. I LOVE these, now I just need to try the other flavors!<br /><br />Side note... Boo Amazon dropping subscribe and save discount on Popchips to 5%...

review/summary: Convenient, tasty, crunchy
review/text: These tortilla chips are conveniently in single-serving bags with each bag containing only 4 grams of fat and 120 calories for those watching their weight.  They are nicely crunchy with a very nacho-cheesy flavor.  The flavor might be a little strong depending on your preferences.  If you like to know you have really had a taste of Tex Mex, this is the chip for you.  I first got onto Popchips in the nutrition center of our local food market.  Now I have seen them also in the larger chain grocery stores.  The price is definitely a savings over buying a package at a time. It gets my recommendation.

review/summary: The best cup of coffee I have ever had!
review/text: Still smarting from the Community Coffee deal that I indulged in, I got right back on the horse in my quest for finding great coffee on Amazon.<br /><br />I have had a few weeks and gone through a full bag of this coffee, subjecting my family and friends to pots of coffee brewed with Eight O'Clock 50% Decaf Whole Bean Coffee.  Quotes from my victims:<br /><br />My mother-in-law, "I don't like decaf, are you sure this is decaf?  This is too good to be decaf."<br /><br />My father-in-law:  Asked for a second cup.  Honey, you never have a second cup of MY coffee!<br /><br />My cousin, "Oh my God...this is better than Dunkin' Donuts!"<br />My cousin the next day, "Would you mind making some more of that delicious coffee?"<br /><br />My wife, who only used to drink Dunkin' Donuts coffee,: "Are you making coffee this morning?"<br /><br />What do I think?  It's the best cup of home-brewed coffee that I have ever had.  I am a big Dunkin' coffee fan, so I won't say it's better than DD....but it's very close if it isn't better!<br /><br />Keys to success:  "Use fresh, filtered water.  Use half and half or cream.  Grind the beans fresh.  Use a ratio of 1 1/2 tablespoons for each 6oz cup of coffee."<br /><br />If you haven't had this yet, do yourself a favor and give it a shot.  I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Convenient, but bland
review/text: It's certainly convenient to have an out-of-the bag 50% Decaf bean, and the price is certainly right, BUT... I actually find this coffee to be fairly bland in taste.  I've tried adjusting the amounts, but I was unable to coax a really rich taste from these beans.  I have gone back to mixing Caf and Decaf myself.  (I just pour the Caf beans into one side of the burr grinder, and Decaf into the other side.)  Currently I'm mixing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZVG">Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Co, Whole Bean Coffee, Decaf Private Reserve, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0KG1E">Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend, Ground, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>, and this makes a pretty rich cup.  Also, manually mixing beans gives you a better opportunity to experiment with different bean flavors, which is fun...

review/summary: 'Balanced' Indeed
review/text: The Eight O'Clock line of coffees has always represented extraordinary value. I had occasion to prepare a coffee tasting for a small group of wine-lovers a few years back. The contenders were Eight O'Clock Bokar blend, Illy Cafe's Famiglia blend and two blends from a very famous coffee shop chain that probably has a store within three blocks of your house.<br />I asked the tasters to use wine descriptors to judge the coffees and then to  make a judgment of overall satisfaction. Of the 22 in the group,21 picked either the Illy or the Eight O'Clock in first place and all 22 picked one of them for second.<br />This blend is one that we use at home for the afternoon or early evening cup when we don't want to be over-caffeinated. The flavor is truly balanced, slightly fruity with a hint of toasty chocolate. It's a medium-bodied blend, but you can concentrate it by using less water without harming the flavor.<br />I strongly recommend using a plunger type french press coffee maker like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LM0R">Bodum Chambord 3-Cup Coffee Press</a> or the unbreakable<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YY9X">Bodum Columbia 8-Cup Stainless-Steel Thermal Press Pot</a>.<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman, author of The New Short Course in Wine and the extremely well balanced bang BANG: A Novel

review/summary: A flavorful Half Caf-- see update
review/text: Picked this up at a SUPER price on Amazon. The first pot of this coffee that I made was so blaah and lacking any body that I packed it up and sent it back.<br /><br />I would give a higher rating if the coffee had been fresher. The "best if used by" dates on my shipment were not as far out as what I can buy at the "W" store by 3 or 4 months. When I opened the first bag it had a pleasant but almost non-existant aroma. The beans appeared very dry. This is confirmed by nearly no residue in the grinding chamber after grinding. But most beans from Eight O'Clock seem to be dry. I have now used Bokar Blend, Columbian, Original, and Original Decaf the 50/50.  Have not tried the French of Italian roasts, but I am guessing that the beans would have some oil sheen on them.<br /><br />Im summary EOC full decaf in the green bag tastes better.<br /><br />Update: 10/3/2010 I tried the Half Caf in a Mellita 4 cup cone drip maker, and had better results. It had more body and flavor than when brewed in my Bunn. My guess is that the fast brew cycle of the Bunn, is too quick to extract flavor fron decafs and half cafs. So I am upping my rating to 4, stars for a less intensifying coffee experience that tastes good. Tastes much better and still smooth like all EOC coffees.

This is the best coffee we have made in our all in one coffee pot (grind and brew).  Even Dunkin' Donuts beans were not as good.  However, Dunkin' Donuts is the best when you buy it brewed at their stores (wish I knew the secret).  This 8 o'clock coffee is the closest we can get at home to the Dunkin' Donuts stores.

I have to admit the flavor is a little weak, I guess because of the de-caf, but for the price you can't go wrong. On the subscription plan it is cheaper than I can find locally, except when a store has BOGO. I would rather have it delivered. Bottom line, can you find better coffees? Yes. But for a daily cup of coffee this is good for me!

review/text: I read the reviews for these beans and took a chance because I was looking to spend less money on coffee than I was at a leading coffee house ($14 a pound). I came to Amazon to look for an alternative that had less caffiene. I was willing to spend so much money on beans at the coffee house, to get a GOOD tasting cup of 1/2 caff coffee.<br /><br />This coffee is a different flavor, but just as good as the name brand coffee house coffee bean. It is less than half the price per pound (especially if you do the subscribe feature where they mail it once a month, free shipping- I am getting it for about $6 a pound that way) and I do believe that since the smaller amount of caffiene in this bean is the nature of this bean, vs. a decaffinating process, that makes this coffee bean even better. I have read that there are lots of chemicals involved in most decaf processes, and if I can get less caffeine without all the chemicals, all the better!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this bean for those that want less caffiene but all the flavor.

review/text: This is a low caffeine coffee which is big on flavor. We have a self-grinding coffee maker and the coffee is full flavored with no bitter taste and low acid as well. Even regular coffee drinkers will enjoy this great flavor and also enjoy the health benefit of low caffeine.

review/summary: Stale Beans
review/text: I have been buying 8 O'clock whole bean 50% decaf from Amazon for several months now through their subscribe and save program. Certainly a great deal @ $0.38/oz + free shipping.<br /><br />Sadly, the last two shipments have not been fresh beans, despite there being 9-10 months left on the "sell by" date. When I open the foil bags there is no fresh bean aroma - only stale and the coffee is very bland tasting despite my new burr grind and brew coffee maker. The drop in freshness seems to coincide with the change in the package a few months back.

review/summary: Very surprised with the bad after taste
review/text: This is the worse coffee I have ever bought. There is a distinct chemical aftertaste to the flavor. I may be wrong, but I associate it with the decaf process. I have experienced this taste with older cheap decaf blends as well.<br />Even the beans smell off. I threw away 3 and a half bags of the 4 bag order after giving up, even after trying to blend it with other coffees that I like.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product. I have used saffon for years and this is the real deal! The price is quite steep and I do not suggest using it for tea! This is a great coloring and flavoring for rice, cookies, cakes and a little on poultry. It would be a waste to use it as tea. I normally crush it and add to hot water to get the maximum fragrance and flovor. Look up recipes to use Saffron in food. Bon Apetit!!

review/summary: Can't decide if they're better than nothing.
review/text: I was so dying for a low carb cracker so I could enjoy some Atkin's approved tuna fish or egg salad on it, that I ordered four boxes of these crackers in different flavors. I anxiously waited a week for their arrival and immediately dug into one....<br /><br />Let me tell you what these taste exactly like. When you were young, were you ever feeling adventurous and wondered what your pet Fido's dog biscuits tasted like? I did and used to chew half-heartedly on one now and then. Remember that hard, mealy taste?<br /><br />Smackaroos crackers taste exactly like dog biscuits. Flatter, thinner dog biscuits.<br /><br />I mean, I'm eating mine because I laid out $25 for four tiny boxes (and yes, the boxes are tiny) and don't have money to waste. But I can't decide if they're better than nothing.<br /><br />So if you want to sample Smackaroos, go to a PetSmart or your neighbor's house and borrow a dog biscuit.<br /><br />Same darn flavor.

review/text: I am on a ketogenic diet, so the only carb I need is fiber. These work perfectly! I love dipping them into peanut butter, but I'm sure they could replace pita chips with hummus, too! They're not salty (not that I have anything against salt), not sweet although the only carb they contain is a gram of sugar and they satisfy that crunchy snack need. The fat and protein helps you feel full.

We received the mini twistz as a Christmas gift for our dogs and one of our dogs started having petit mal seizures about once a week after Christmas. We couldn't figure out what was going on but when a friend pointed out that these treats were from China we tossed them real fast and sure enough the seizures have stopped. Of course I can't prove that the seizures were caused from these treats but I can't help think there's a connection.

This German sugar gives a total different to the sweet taste to your tea and tastes authentic and delicious with the perfect amount of sweetness.  I also love the style of the sugar and the jar it comes in.  This is also a great deal for the quantity you are getting.  If you are buying Teavana tea, I HIGHLY recommend that you at least buy a little bit of this to go along with it.  You know all of the samples they serve in-store?  Well, the sweetened ones are always sweetened with this, and they definitely taste different if sweetened otherwise.  Give it a try - it makes an unbelievably huge difference to your tea-drinking experience.

review/summary: The "Best" Licorice
review/text: I am a black licorice lover.  Over the years, I have eaten licorice products from around the world.  My sister sent me Black Licorice Scottie Dogs as a gift, and I fell in love with them.  I next found them in The Fresh Market, where they are sold by the pound, at a price that caused me to buy them only on a periodic basis.  Then I did some research and found that Gimbal's makes them and that I could by them through Amazon.com.  I ordered a box, which is a supply that can last a very long time.  My friends and neighbors discovered them in the small candy dish my wife keeps on the large island in our kitchen.  I had to order 2 more boxes to fill all the requests to have a bag of the great little treats.<br /><br />A box contains two (2) 5 lbs. bags.  The bag is plastic and sealed tightly, so the licorice remains fresh for a long time.  When you compare the price of a 10 lbs. box versus what specialty food stores charge per pound, the box is by far the better deal.<br /><br />According to experts:<br /><br />"Licorice is in fact a powerful antiviral that contains 10 antioxidants, at least 25 fungicidal and 9 expectorant compounds. Licorice also includes MAO inhibitors, several XO inhibitors, and natural estrogenic ingredients. But this is not all that helps to form licorice. Licorice is also made up of beneficial components such as phytochemicals, magnesium, and sodium."<br /><br />Enjoy the benefits and the treat!!!!

review/text: Scottie dogs used to be made by a company that is no longer in business, so we were delighted when we saw them, yet concerned if they would taste the same. To our pleasant surprise, they have the same natural licorice flavor. Too much candy licorice in the stores is made of molasses and "licorice flavoring"--whatever that means. So, if you love the taste of natural licorice, you'll love these. On caution though, they are sticky, so beware if you have a bridge or false teeth.

review/summary: Great Food For Dogs With Stomach Issues
review/text: We adopted our two year old, female german Shepherd, Cheyenne, from a local shelter last year. We knew nothing about her background or what she ate. I started with a dry food which our previous dog did very well on. Immediately, Cheyenne began having soft stools and diarhea. After a few weeks I tried another premium dry food... same results, soft-serve ice cream stools and sometimes watery stools. Months went by and I tried several other dry and wet foods and dietary supplements with little improvement. It drove me crazy! I took her to the vet and they did tests and ruled out worms, etc... and told me that German Shepherds are known to have stomach issues. Finally, I picked up a bag of Blue Buffalo Freedom / Grain Free... and Cheyenne loved it and her stools immediately firmed up! Most of the time her stools are very normal and firm now... sometimes they are a little soft... but nothing compared to before. I am so happy I tried Blue Buffalo Freedom. I hope that it works as well for you!

review/text: We have been using Blue since our dog was a puppy.  We adopted him and wanted to make sure we fed him as healthy as possible because I know it can cut down on vet bills in the long run.  Over time we have tried the different formulas, and when Freedom came out I decided to give it a try.  I love the grain-free aspect.  My dog is not a fast eater. He takes his time and savors every bit.  We do mix in real chicken and a dollop of cottage cheese.  He is 3 1/2 now.  He has had no major helath issues, is in excellent shape, gets all kinds of compliments on his coat, and we have people stop us all the time to tell us what a good looking dog he is.  (He is an Australian shepherd/possible cattle dog mix.) I wouldn't feed my family a bunch of chemicals and low grade ingredients, and my pets are like family.  Try it.  You may be surprised how much it can help your pet.

review/summary: Cured our pups digestion challenges!
review/text: Blue Buffalo Freedom is both grain free and slightly higher in fiber (7%) compared to other standard and grain free foods (typically 3-4%). We adopted a 4 month old mixed Aussie Cattle/McNab and a 3 month old Shepherd/Lab mix from our Bay Area rescue group. Both pups were very healthy and energetic. Our Vet checks were good, and they settled into our home quickly. The only issue was with their digestion/stools. At first, hoped it was just stress, but it persisted for a few weeks. The premium food we selected was an upgrade from the cereal filled budget food they had at the shelter, but evidently, the richer protein level (29-32%) of "Taste of Wild" and "Premium Edge" did not go down well for both pups. While they appeared to enjoy the food, eating it all, it just never set well with them. We did put the pups on Science Diet (digestion special) for a short term, but the pups did not seem to like the food and it only partially appeared to solve their issue. After reading several reviews and noting that some people experienced issues with wheat or grain based food/treats, we decided to try Blue Buffalo Freedom for both the grain free and higher fiber ingredients. Magic! Both pups love the food, and digestion has been resolved. Stress still disrupts their system a bit, such as after a rigorous day at the park running and wrestling with other dogs, but their digestion clears up quickly. Note: We also limit their treats to non-grain/no wheat as much as possible. Natural Balance has mostly potato and meat based treats. Our only wish, Amazon would carry the Large Dog (orange label) Freedom version. We use kibble balls to keep the Aussie/McNab mix working, and the standard size kibble (blue label) is too small and pours out of the kibble ball. Cheers to Blue Buffalo Freedom and scoopable poop! Walking our dogs is no longer traumatic for everyone!

review/text: We usually have to travel to China Town to buy this product and was so happy to have found it on Amazon. It was sent to us quickly and we love this tea which is very good for us. We would order from this company again. Thanks

review/text: I had been purchasing loose leaves from another company, but one day when they weren't available, I ordered these bags.  Blech!!  The loose leaves from Immortalitea were such a pleasant tasting product.  These bags are so pungently horrible tasting that one shudders when sipping it.  I can't get past the taste.

review/summary: Tastes terrible
review/text: If you like bitter, putrid tastes, this may be the tea for you.  The tea tastes so terrible I am sure it will be thrown out.  Gynostemma is supposed to taste good. Something is very wrong with this product.  I drink a lot of herbal teas, so I can usually tolerate new flavor.

review/text: I bought jiaogulan from multiple places and this brand doesn't taste right. It tastes bitter with no sweet aftertaste. I would not buy Sheng Tangshen Brand jiaogulan/gynostemma pentaphyllum.
