review/summary: Republic of Tea - Ginger Peach and Ginger Peach White - YUMMMY
review/text: I guess we have all been conned into believing tea cannot be good from a bag.  You have to be a true snob to believe that after you've had Republic of Tea.  I've tried at least a dozen and, so far, my favorites are Republic of Tea Ginger Peach and Ginger Peach White bagged teas.  It's a bit expensive but, if having a smooth and flavorable cup of tea is your thing, this is The Tea for a delightful morning brew.  The smell is exquisite and the taste is soothing and full-bodied.  It has no bitter aftertaste, no sting, no bite.  Just wonderful taste and small.  You've love it!

review/summary: An excellent beginner's kit
review/text: In general, I'd recommend that you would go to a local brewing store and work out exactly what you need and want to get started brewing your own beer. You'd likely end up with a setup that is pretty similar to this one. That leaves price and flexibility as the main issues. Glancing at a brewing catalog, it looks like this setup isn't a bad deal pricewise. And of course if you don't have a local brewing store, then buying this one is that much easier. Do compare the items included in any of these kits, there are a lot of them listed on amazon, some for as little as half of the price of this one. And remember that you can save a lot of shipping cost by buying kits without bottles. Use your own collected bottles.

review/summary: Very good starter kit
review/text: Ordered and received kit in Jan 2011. Started brewing March 3 2011, drank first bottle around April 4. Bavarian Hefweizen, very good taste, about 5-6 percent alcohol or 10-12 proof. Must follow directions and keep everything clean. Quality kit contained everyting to make your first brew, but I've added a few things like hops bags and thermometer and extra bottle caps. I do not recommend buying inexpensive kits. I also recommend buying "Joy of Home Brewing" to go along with the kit. The kit directions are basic, the book has helpful tips. The price I paid was better than what I would pay locally, in this area, by about $40. I prefered new bottles, as I didn't want to mess with finding and cleaning bottles with non twist off caps. Extra 12 oz. bottles run about $12 for 24 bottles. First batch figures out to about $3 per bottle, which includes the cost of the kit. After that it's about 50 cents a bottle. As a side note, I started my second batch May 19. Enjoy! :)

review/summary: This is great!
review/text: Unlike the "Soup at Hand" product line, making this a single serving hasn't reduced the taste or appearance of the product at all.  This is pretty much true of all the single serving Campbell's soups in this size, which is called a "Soup Bowl".  Originally, these bowls were smaller, more on the order of 10 or 12 ounces.  At 15 ounces, this is a bit more than a single serving, at least for me.  I would like it a bit smaller.  I would also like to see more products sold this way; for example, Cream of Mushroom and Bean with Bacon would both be on my favorites list.

review/summary: An in-your-face Kenyan
review/text: This is a really nice Kenyan, very similar to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ55D6">Batdorf & Bronson Kenya AA</a>.  Perfectly roasted, with the bright acidity that is a Kenyan hallmark, and definitely more assertive than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHJ1AU">Diedrich</a> offering.  I'd rate this as a tie with the Batdorf & Bronson, with Diedrich coming up a close second.<br /><br />NOTE:  This review was for the Kenya AA, NOT the Kenya AB.  Apparently the AA isn't currently available, and the title was switched without creating a new ASIN.  I haven't tried the Kenya AB.

review/text: I actually bought this by mistake, not realizing that I would get only 18 pods for $20.  Usually Senseo delivers several packages of 16/18 pods.<br /><br />I'm glad I got it because it is great coffee.  Kona coffee is grown in a small section of the Big Island, so the supply is very small, hence, the high price.  When you combine Kona coffee with other Hawaiian coffees, you get a drink with a strong, complex taste, well worth the price for the occasional cup.<br /><br />I still have seventeen pods left, and I will space them out carefully.

review/text: I was informed by my gift recipient that these crackers arrived with incomplete packages. That is to say- something occurred at the factory and instead of six little crackers in the package, you get perhaps four, and the entire side of one cracker is exposed with the cheese uncovered in the pack. Obviously a defective run, but why wouldn't someone notice? When you have a 90 count package and most are defective, I mean...what the heck?<br />The taste is good on these crackers, I can say that for them. But it embarrasses me to purchase something for someone else and have it be defective.

review/summary: This is my new favorite gum!!
review/text: A few months ago I discovered Mentos gum, and loved the way the gum had a very long lasting chewability.  The first flavors I tried were Watermelon and Red Fruit.  After some online searching I found that there were a number of different flavors, so I ordered some of each flavor so I could have my own little taste test.  After all of the sampling, Sweet Mint emerged as my absolute favorite.  It has just a little bit of a mint bite, and proved to be very enjoyable.  A lot of the mint gums just completely overpower you when you start chewing on them.  I now order the Sweet Mint flavor by the box, so I can always have a good supply on hand.  Watermelon anod Red Fruit are still on hand, too - just not in the quantity!

review/summary: Good - with a caveat
review/text: As I recently became vegan, and have incorporated tofu into my diet, I wanted to get a protein powder that was without dairy and soy.  This one fit the bill, and has vitamins and minerals included that many vegans risk being deficient in (B12, Calcium, Iron).  I add it to my oatmeal, I think it makes the taste richer and I appreciate that there are no added sweeteners.  The reason I give the product 4 stars is that, although I should have inspected more closely and seen this before purchasing, it has 270mg sodium per serving.  I find this to be too high, I even find my oatmeal a bit too salty.  Thus, I plan to mix this with another soy-free powder to lower the sodium content.  Otherwise, I think this is a great product.

Currently using this product more in foods like soups and it really seems to work better flavor-wise. Also for baking (breads, muffins, vege-burgers, loafs) it's a great way top bump up your protein intake.

review/text: I almost didn't believe this was going to be a 32oz container when I ordered it because I buy the 16oz at local grocery stores for the same price all the time.  So, twice as much for the same price!!  This is a great product I've been using for years.  It's great for vegetarians because it does NOT contain soy, which is great in moderation.

review/summary: Kind of a life-saver
review/text: I was recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes and being a vegetarian, tofu and eggs were my only pure-protein options and I grew sick of those very soon. Discovered this protein powder and have been using it in my cooking ever since. I have added it to soups, stews, curries and smoothies. I am yet to try making rotis with it.  I prefer it cooked in my meal than in smoothies. It is better used with something that already has an overpowering taste. The product's website says it CAN be used in cooking, so I assume the nutrient value is not lost by doing so.<br /><br />I think it is a little high on sodium, but atleast it gives me more options in my food now. I have not tried any other protein powders, so I don't know how it rates compared to others in the market taste-wise.

review/summary: Surprised!!!!!
review/text: This protein powder was quite good. However if you are used to sweets and proteins that taste like candy you will notice that this product is not sweet, but its not chalk dust either. I have used this protein in shakes and smoothies with fruit and without fruit and it didn't affect the taste of my food. My 14 year old daughter doesn't mind either (she's picky too!!!) This is a keeper for me I thought this was going to be like "other" protein powders I have tried that are vegan that taste like bitter crap but I was pleasently surprised this one is quite good it mixes well by the way not gritty at all !!!!!!!

review/text: The taste isn't great, but you can get used to it (I mix mine in water).  I am a vegan and I don't like eating a lot of soy (I think it may upset my stomach).  This product has 0 grams of sugar and only 4 grams of carbohydrates and is very low in fat, so you cannot expect it to taste DELICIOUS. There is 22 grams of protein per serving from non-soy vegetable sources, so 3 shakes a day for a work out routine plus snacks in between is a routine worth trying.

review/summary: Horrible taste
review/text: This product tastes horrible.  I was looking for a soy free protein and came upon this item.  I mixed it with soymilk and it tasted like pea-flavored chalk.  I thought I might have used too much powder so I tried half the amount of powder and it still tasted the same.  Not wanting to give up, I mixed in a scoop of strawberry flavored whey protein and it truly tasted like a combination of strawberry and chalk.<br /><br />My fiancee then tried it and couldn't take more than a sip.  In the end, I was able to down three cups of it, but I don't think I can drink any more in the future. I am going to take them up on their money back product guarantee.

review/summary: My kids love them!
review/text: These are less like mints and more like "SweetTart" or "Smarties".  They are perfect for my kids with braces who need to eat xylitol after every meal and snack to cut down on cavities.  My kids love to eat them and Amazon' subscribe and save price is by far the cheapest on the internet for these.<br /><br />Studies show that by chewing a couple of grams of xylitol after every meal that cavities can be drastically reduced. Its too early to tell for sure if these are working, but since my kids can't chew xylitol gum with braces, I'm hoping this will give them the cavity-fighting benefits of xylitol.

Obviously I am not cool but I can assure you my taste buds know by instinct what is repulsive at first taste and this one, miracle whip, can not compete in my kitchen. Got so aggravated that I returned the product to my local market claiming about a "funny taste" which saved me, cheap cheap me, the money spent.

And they are very salty.  I only cooked them for 90 seconds, the bag was still expanding when I stopped it but they smelled burnt when they were done (they said to cook until it stopped expanding but thank goodness I didn't do that).  Nice idea but I don't think I will buy these again.

It is, but it holds a lot - these pork rinds are compact; they expand when cooked, so there's a lot more in the box than it looks like.<br /><br />As snacks go, these are high in protein and low in carbohydrate.<br /><br />I think this is a really good value, and these are very flavorful - I especially enjoy them with bean dip.<br /><br />The only thing that I'd change is, I'd like a lightly salted version; I don't always want that much salt.

review/summary: Great
review/text: Great product, I never cook this in the microwave because sometimes it takes longer and not all microwaves are the same.  I've read people reviews and they said there were small brown pieces that were hard, that means they were not cooked long enough.  The best way to cook these are to use a medium size pan, pour the pack into the pan and shake it around and bake them in the oven @ 400 degrees for 4-6 minutes, keep a close eye on them because they burn easy.  But it is worth it to cook it in the oven, very hot and fresh and no uncooked curls.  They will appear to be brown at first but they "poof" up in the oven once they're heated.  I would say do not microwave these in a bag, use a oven safe plate, that way you can actually see them puff up, older/cheap microwaves can take 4-6 minutes to cook.

review/summary: Pretty good, but I am not sure that I will buy again
review/text: It was quite a commitment for me to buy this quantity of pork rinds from Amazon but I decided that I would "give it a go" since I like the pork rinds that are sold in grocery stores and I figured that these could only be better since they'd be fresher when microwaved.  They taste great and I think that they have the perfect amout of spice.  HOWEVER, two things....the smell is "funky" when they come out of the microwave.  Regardless of the taste, I can't seem to get used to the smell.  Secondly, when it comes to popcorn, I have to pop popcorn less than the directions on the package in my microwave or it will burn.  I found it to be the opposite with these pork rinds.  I had to cook the port rinds LONGER than the directions say on the package, otherwise they wouldn't be popped nicely and were a bit chewy.  So if you find that you cook these and they don't seem crispy enough, cook them in your microwave longer than the directions say to do so.

review/summary: Great item
review/text: I was never a big fan of pork rinds. But since I started doing Atkins, I was buying them sometimes to fill that desire for a crunchy, salty snack.  I ended up only buying the hot variety since it seemed to cover the taste of the rinds better than plain or bbq.  After reading the reviews here, decided to give these a try.<br /><br />I had never had anything other than the bagged variety of pork rinds.  As others have mentioned here, these are far superior to anything you will find in a bag.  Way, way better than any bagged variety I have sampled.  Plus the make this great popping, crackling noise when you take them out for a minute or so that I greatly enjoy for some reason.<br /><br />Do mind the cooking instructions.  If you overcook, they will end up tasting closer to the bagged taste you are trying to avoid.  Still better than bagged though.  I tried different times in my microwave but found it best to watch and take them out as soon as the bag stops rising.  You will sometimes have some that did not expand(you can pop these back in the microwave to try and revive them) but it is not worth burning some of them to try to ensure all have expanded.

review/summary: A for freshness, but d*mn are they salty.......
review/text: I was so excited to see these! And the price is good.<br /><br />First, it takes a little learning to figure out how to cook these. The instructions are not much help. "Stop cooking when the bag stops expanding"....they might as well say, perform a Vulcan mind meld with the pork rinds to know when they are done. I found that the bag's expansion--or not---has little to do with whether they are done. I have a 1200 watt microwave and 1:30 was perfect. 1:00 and they were not cooked, 2:00 and I had charcoal bits.<br />I had to sacrifice a couple of precious bags to figure this out.<br /><br />Taste and texture? Well they are infinitely better than bags of pork rinds from the store. The texture is very good. The taste? I am in no way shy of salty food, love me some salt! But these were borderline too much for me. I did sprinkle some cinnamon and Ideal on them to make them sweet and I still had a hard time eating them. My husband liked them this way though.<br /><br />If they could back off the strong salty flavor, I would buy these again. As it is, I'm going to use them to make low-carb nachos. I won't be reordering them though. Love the crispy texture! But can't choke down the overpowering saltiness.

review/summary: Not quite what I expected
review/text: These are an okay snack. They don't puff up like the Pork Rinds I have had in the past. The quantity of rinds in the bag seems lacking. There is a unusual taste as if some type of seasoning added that I can't figure out. If you want a salty snack with no carbs they are okay, I, however, will not buy them again. I'll stick with the regular puffed up ones or cracklings. These don't fit in either category quite the way I expected.

review/text: I've had pork rinds in the bag and all, and they were usually stale with no flavor.  Since these are cooked fresh, they come out nice and warm.  They have a slight bacon flavor and aren't greasy like potato chips are.  A little salty, but very good.  I can't find them in any of the stores here either, so I'm happy Amazon has t hem.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UP8QQ0">Lowrey's Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds, Hot & Spicy, 1.75-Ounce Packages (Pack of 18)</a> In order to appreciate the taste of a "fresh" Pork Rind, head to a Meat Market that has them.  There is no comparison to that "Rind", with the "traditional" store version.(Bagged)  Lowrey's Microwave Pork Rinds came along and created the perfect answer and a new experience for true Pork Rind Fans!! Usually, each bag will create 11 to 15 Large pieces, and some smaller bites.  The best way to eat them is immediately after removing them from the Microwave, when they are Hot and Chewy. (Cook Times Vary: 2:15 min./sec. for me) Airtight package when it arrives, and is not too spicy for those Non-Chili eaters.  They were sold in stores up until 2 years ago, and may still, but Amazon is the only place I know that has them when you want them.  Every bag is seal wrapped and can be stored like popcorn, so no need to keep the box! If anything, the novelty of this product will break the ice of any party or gathering.  Enjoy.

review/summary: Snap crackle and pop of pork rinds
review/text: Few things are as enjoyable in life as freshly popped pork rinds.  Modern technology has enabled us to produce the epitome of snack foods in a hot, fresh version.  I will be relegated no more to the listless depths of popped corn.  Pork rinds are the ultimate man chips. Very similar to microwaved popcorn, you just shake the bag and put em in your microwave for about 2 min and voila, hot fresh pork rinds.  When you pop them you have to get accustomed to the fact that they don't "pop" like popcorn - they just crackle a bit.  So it is a bit hard to tell when they are done and usually through trial and error you will get the perfect time depending upon the type of microwave oven you use.  Mine is 900W and takes just under 2 min. A couple of pieces will get burnt, or as I affectionately refer to as char. The bag will inflate slightly.  When they are done, you open it up and you are greeted with an aroma that is bacon heaven.  Put one in your mouth right away and it will stick to your tongue like a live octopus.  They are a bit salty so they make the perfect accompaniment to a nice cold beer.  I didn't find them too spicy, just enough.  If you want to be creative, you can throw em in a bowl right after they are done popping and throw some salsa verde or any other kind of salsa you have.  You will be greeted with a chorus of wonderful snaps like getting sizzling rice soup at a Chinese restaurant.  Throw on some shredded cheese and the result is "man nachos".  My wife thinks that it is utterly disgusting, even though that hasn't stopped her from eating them.  Trust me, they are delicious, but don't let em sit too long or they get soggy.

review/summary: Practical and delicious. However, has preservatives!
review/text: These chicharrones are delicious, and the packaging is very convenient.  Just like microwave popcorn, the pork rinds come in a bag with cellophane around it.  You shake the bag to distribute the pork rinds, pop it in the microwave, and set the cooking time.<br /><br />The optimal time for my microwave is one minute 45 seconds, but the time will likely differ from one microwave to another.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this product five starts is due to the MSG listed as an ingredient.  While I don't react badly to MSG it still makes me a little nervous.<br /><br />If you're on a low-carb diet this is a great choice for snacking or even meal replacement.

review/text: I am doing the Atkins program for weight loss, and I was missing crunchy, crispy things. Celery just doesn't get it. Our local stores don't regularly carry pork rinds, so I was feeling a little bit left out.<br /><br />But, the Lowry's brand is one I am familiar with and so, I was pretty confident I would like them. They don't pop like popcorn; in fact, they don't make much noise at all when they are cooking. I've found that one minute forty eight seconds seems to be the best time to get the most edible rinds. BUT....one can also reheat the unpopped rinds and a lot of them will then puff up.<br /><br />Enjoy...they are worth it.

review/text: Unlike microwave popcorn, you cannot hear the pork skins cooking, so only by trial and error and the wattage of your microwave will you know how long to cook these. Cooked to the proper timing, they will be fluffy, melt in you mouth. 15 seconds too long you will have a stinky unedible product.<br />It is something that you must try. I cooked mine for 1 minute 45 seconds and they were not all done. I do not know the wattage of my microwave.<br />So try them for your self. As I said, they are different than popcorn, but have the same results if left too long in the micowave, stinky.

review/summary: Not Bacon, but still a great snack
review/text: I love reading reviews about the smell.  Have you really though this through.  We are taking pork rind pellets, and microwaving them till they expand.  It's frankly amazing they don't smell worse.  Beyond the smell of cooking rind (which I don't mind by the way), these snacks are great.  It took us a two bags to figure out the cook time.  To little and you don't get full expansion, to much and they get hard, I mean real hard.  For us it is 1 minute 30 seconds to perfection every time.  I really like the seasoning as well.  I don't find it offensively over board or chemically.  Basically it is a simple snack.

review/summary: The Microwave Pork Rinds Are Surpisingly Fantastic
review/text: I have not had pork rinds in more than 20 years and thought that this would be fun to try but I didn'nt have high expectations. Microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success. However, I had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn.  Well it does.  I don't have much with which to compare the taste (20+ years ago), however, the texture and crispiness is just as I remembered. I like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted, these are not especially spicy but I used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job.<br /><br />It is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave.  I have also found that 2 mins 30 seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds.<br /><br />I have eaten 9 bags of the pork rinds and I love them.  They are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn.  And each bag is only 1 carb.
