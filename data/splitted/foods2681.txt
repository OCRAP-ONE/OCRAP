review/summary: Easy, Tastes Great, Versatile
review/text: Great tasting seasoning and comes with 3 super easy recipes on the back of the package: the basic recipe - add chicken, celery, carrots and potatoes; the chicken a la king recipe - add celery, frozen peas and mushrooms and lastly the chicken cacciatore recipe - add tomatoes, green pepper, sliced olives, onion basil and oregano.<br /><br />I love the chicken cacciatore recipe. You can add tons of different veggies (whatever kind you like really and I use about double what the recipe calls for and add a small can of V-8 juice along with the tomatoes), throw the whole thing in the crockpot and go. It cooks on low for about 6-7 hours but lots of times I've ended up leaving it in for 8+ hours (I just add frozen meat rather than thawed) and when I get home the house smells great and I can have dinner on the table in about 15 minutes.<br /><br />This is also really good if you add bok choy, water chestnuts and other chinese type veggies and some soy sauce to taste. I use the lite soy sauce and lots of veggies.<br /><br />The only downside to this is that it IS kind of salty. I recommend adding more vegetables than what the packet calls for or maybe use just part of the package to cut the salt.

review/summary: Great flavor-beware contains hidden MSG!
review/text: I tried this receipe last week with chicken and it was delicious.<br />However, a few hours later, I woke up with a severe migraine, vomiting and upset stomach.<br />I am allergic to MSG and suspected that somehow the ingredients in this packet were the culprit.<br />Sure enough, I went to the truthinlabeling.org for a list of ingredients that contain hidden MSG.<br />One of these ingredients is "hydrolized soy protein" which contains hidden MSG, and is one of the ingredients found in this seasoning packet.<br />Unfortunately, I will not be able to use this product again. While my family loved it (and I did too) you do have to be aware if you suffer from this kind of food allergy. For that reason, I have to give it a one star.

review/summary: A step up from most dog foods but it's not food grade
review/text: I spent many years studying canine nutrition and it is fairly appalling how many of the major diseases and health issues began when we stopped feeding dogs table scraps and began feeding them processed foods. (See studies by Dr Pitcairn) Now granted, this was still a progression because toxins like onions were eliminated from their diet but poor quality processed foods, the same each day, are no mystery: we would suffer health issues if we chose that diet for life, and they need health as much as we do.<br /><br />Primary issues: the vitamins added in most foods are then cooked which means they are left deactivated; most foods are made for profit meaning they have mostly fillers and food not fit for human consumption and can even be high in allergens such as soy or corn, leaving chronic itching, poor coat, etc.<br /><br />But the main issue, aside from it being poor nutrition, in 99% of dog food is that it's not food grade meat. Why would this matter? I've actually visited the places that proved why this mattered.  In Hereford, TX they raise the majority of beef used in this country. (Your suitcase will arrive back home after the flight here reeking of cow manure. But it's a pretty city.) In front of me a bulldozer was picking up cows that just dropped dead or were in the process. I wanted to scream. I asked what happens to them and was told they are taken to the local dog food manufacturer...which is why the dog food manufacturers are built near large cattle farms. In a nutshell, free diseased meat. Cows don't go to a morgue to see why they died or what disease or virus they had. They go straight into dog food.<br /><br /> Can't believe this? Think back a few years ago when dogs were dying and there was a massive pet food recall. This was because most of the companies drew from the same downed livestock. There were only a handful of companies that were not on the recall list. These were the very, very few that use food grade meat. What that means? Meat meant for food. Appalling huh? Dogs are usually forced to eat non food grade meat.<br /><br />Food grade meat is marked as such on the can. You will rarely find it. Newman's Own is an example of one of the very few I've found that use meat inspected for human consumption...i.e. food grade.<br /><br />However, I've got one dog who for whatever reason doesn't like the taste of Newman's Own. She was raised, prior to my owning her, on cheap dog food and I swear she hates vitamins and good beef or something. (their products are also balanced for nutritional benefit)<br /><br />So I do supplement her diet back and forth.  I like that Ultramix is built better than most dog foods. The nutritional profile and ingredients are well balanced and well thought out. There are no byproducts (the parts that no one would want to eat being ground up) there are good solid veggies like spinach and some fruit mixed in and it has an excellent vitamin profile. It has a very small amount of garlic (garlic in large quantities will hurt your dog's liver and kidneys but in very small measured amounts is a natural flea and worm preventative.)<br /><br />My dogs love the taste<br /><br />The drawback is that it's not human grade or food grade meat so yes, you are still subject to use of downed and diseased cattle when it's not. So I don't use this often but for my dog who won't eat Newman's Own and for when I don't have time to mix up a good homemade meal, I do look for alternatives to supplement.<br /><br />It amazes me how in today's time there are still foods served to any animals that are, by all FDA standards, "not fit for human consumption". There is a rise in homes preparing homemade meals. Veterinary schools are funded by dog food companies but extensive studies show that issues we have today were all but unheard of prior to their poor processed food diets. And vegetables and fruits are important for pets which are often overlooked. Think they don't eat them naturally? If your dog sees grass and begins chewing, it's a way of getting these into their diet. In nature, the first part of an animal a wild dog, coyote, or wolf, will eat is the stomach of the rabbit or what he kills for food. This is where they get their vegetable content naturally. In reality, in the wild their diets are very similar to our own...except they aren't cooked! But the balance of fresh meats and vegetables is actually similar. They do not eat ground corn and fillers in nature but do get minerals and vitamins in naturally--many of which are depleted in most dog food manufacturing even if they are added in because of the high temps in processing.<br /><br />This is a good natural and balanced food without fillers.  It is not food grade. Add that and it will be perfect with no risk of health concerns. Many have no idea that illnesses can be born from downed cattle or diseased fowl. Unless pets start dying food is not recalled and the health issues are never connected. This needs to be changed.Human grade meats cost more and many have no idea why the few dog foods that use it are more expensive as I think there is little marketing and education regarding this. It took years of study and discussions from a rising population of informed vets to understand it myself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not one day of veterinary school is spent on learning nutrition. It is spent on curing health problems rather than preventing them with a proper diet. That education has to come from self-learning after veterinary school.  And I applaud the rise in vets who are doing it, now that we know how our own diets effect us learn term and can shorten our own lives.<br /><br />While still better than most dog foods, it has one more leap to make it perfect. But many won't pay more for the pet foods that have it so I applaud at least the small part of change this has.

review/summary: Not a keeper here.
review/text: I gave this 3 stars because I do feel it is a quality food, but my dog got bored with it before he was finished with the first can. (two days)  The same thing happened with the chicken stew.  At first I thought maybe he just didn't want leftovers, so I opened another can...same thing.  He seemed to  love it at first, although I was still mixing in his Organix chicken and potatoes.  When it was all the chicken or beef stew, he would barely sniff it.  He would walk around his bowl like he was looking for the good stuff, which I gave him when I took the bowl of stew away.  Too bad, because it seemed like a nice chunky food that he would enjoy.  Not so much.  I know some people feel that "they will eat it when they are hungry enough".  I have never and will never make my pets eat like that.  I wouldn't like to, and I feel they are entitled to have likes and dislikes as well.

review/text: My dog has gotten really picky and won't eat anything.  I tried Castor and Pollux Ultramix<br />along with several other gluten free type dog foods.  He loves the food.  Not always available in local pet stores, so I decided to try to find it at Amazon because they seem to have everything.  Ordered and received with free shipping.  The free shipping was a real bonus because 12 cans of dog food are heaverier then most packages and would probably make the food over $3.00 a can.  The food is great and very convenient to order online.  But be careful when shipping is not a special deal.

review/summary: My dog loves this stuff!
review/text: My three-year old dog Buster has grown up on the mid- to higher-end mainstream brands, such as Purina Pro Plan, Blue Buffalo and Biljac, but lately I've been trying a variety of natural and/or organic canned foods to supplement his dried food.  As soon as you open the can, you can tell that it's better quality than the regular brands from PetSmart or PetCo.  Plus, you can usually find a great deal on natural/organics at Amazon, especially with Subscribe-and-Save, so you're not paying much more than you would for the regular brands.<br /><br />Buster is not a particularly fussy eater and doesn't get upset by changes in his diet.  You can definitely tell he's been enjoying the different varieties we've tried so far.  This Castor & Pollux Ultramix "Beef, Vegetables & Barley" has, without a doubt, been one of his favorites so far.  He eats it down very quickly and rattles the bowl licking every last speck.  It's full of vegetables and chunky beef pieces (not organs and suspicious-looking meat by-products), and could probably pass for a homemade beef and vegetable stew.  The only other brand we've tried that is similar in chunkiness, quality ingredients and smell is "Halo Spot's Stew" (and in my opinion, Halo smells even better!)<br /><br />I am going to order more of this Castor & Pollux!

review/text: I took this one to work with me today and it just about saved my life. It gave me the much-needed energy to deal with with busiest doctor in our practice. It was light and sweet and painfully refreshing. I had some while it was hot, but by the time I was able to find time for finish my thermos-full, it was cold. Even better! My thermos is vaccum-sealed, so I carefully shook it to mix it up again and downed the rest...oh yes. This will definitely be an amazing addition to my summer smoothies. Never mind that it snowed today. Anyway, the berryness of this was just right, not overly sweet or fake, just amazingly delicious. I'm only familiar with goji berries in tea, but this is the best goji flavored tea I've ever had. To be honest, I kept taking sips and being surprised by how good it was. I have the memory span of a goldfish, so it was like I given a gift of amazing tea every time I took a sip. If you're a berry fan who isn't really into strong greens, this might be the tea to get you into matcha. It wasn't overwhelmingly bitter like some matchas can be, it was just a smooth, tasty sip for a long workshift.<br /><br />I am very impressed with their matcha, I have to say. My wife recently bought me a matcha whisk (so much easier!), but I was making it with a regular whisk in a cereal bowl and I have yet to encounter a clump. Like someone else said about their matchas, it's not flavoring added to cover an inferior product.

review/summary: a great tea hot or cold
review/text: I was looking for a lower caffeine tea that still offered flavor, and this vanilla apricot tea fit the bill.  I drink a lot of iced tea, and have found that brewing this double strength and pouring it over ice makes a great iced tea. I usually drink it unsweetened.  As was mentioned in a previous review the apricot flavor is not quite as refined as is offered in a high quality tissane, but it is still quite good.  I took a chance in ordering this tea (6 boxes!), but I am really glad I did. It's my go-to flavored tea, especially in the afternoon and evening.<br /><br />Because I live in a small town, my options for tea purchases are limited to whatever the grocery store or Wal-Mart stocks.  Thank God I can order tea from Amazon!

review/summary: Lovely White Tea with Memorable Flavors
review/text: ****<br />I really enjoy this new white tea from Tazo. It's a subtle and gentle white tea with subdued flavor, which is how I like my white tea. The apricot flavoring is pretty strong, but apricot is appealing to me, so I don't mind. The vanilla is noticeable as well, but secondary to the apricot. There is nothing not to like in this tea; my only criticism (and the reason for only four stars) is that I can tell that it is "flavored" instead of having real ingredients. Still, it's a fine tea, and one of Tazo's better teas at that.<br /><br />I ordered the six pack and am sure that I will use it over the next few months, and probably order more. Other people who aren't so fussy about their tea really love it---it's different and enjoyable!<br />****

review/summary: Great for flavoring a pitcher of iced tea
review/text: I find most flavored teas too strong for a single brewed cup -and I prefer iced tea, so I make a pitcher of iced tea with regular tea bags and just one these tea bags included - adds a nice subtle fruity flavor that isn't overpowering.  I swtiched from soft drinks to iced tea as my beverage of choice, so this allows me to vary the iced tea flavors to keep them from getting boring.  This one is a terrific flavor.

Order 6 boxes at once and get their free shipping. The tea is a wonderful tea to have in the afternoon...very light apricot flavor. This is not a stong tea but I love the flavor...very soothing. I drink the TOZO Cucumber White with dinner. Compliments just about anything I eat and it's a little stonger.

review/text: Boy does this seasoning mix bring back memories! It made our pork roast taste just like the ones we used to enjoy back in our old German/Hungarian neighborhood in NYC, I simply rubbed it all over and let the roast sit in the fridge overnight then roasted in it the oven. Mostly all of those restaurants are gone now and we live far away from the area but this seasoning mix brought those old familiar flavors to the forefront again. I've tried over the years to make up my own mixs based on the flavors I remembered but didn't come really close, this is perfect. I can't wait to try it on other things.

review/summary: Very Good Product!
review/text: We like to have some long-shelf-life foodstuffs so we can improvise meals at times when getting to the food market is difficult. We store cases of beans, veggies and some prepared meals in our pantry shelves. Some of the items are canned or dried fruit and one of them is a case of Festival Mandarin Oranges in light syrup. We purchased the case at our local Costco store and the case is now about three quarters finished. These mandarin oranges are delicious. They're very flavorful and I like the light syrup which makes them much less sweet than many canned fruits. I enjoy them as snacks now and then. An entire can is less than 200 calories. My wife and toddler like them too. We all like them best chilled so you'll generally find a can in the fridge. It's a very good product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Great sweetener...MUCH cheaper elsewhere
review/text: Splenda is an amazing artificial sweetener. But you already know that if you drink Diet Coke with Splenda or you've been to a coffee shop in the past few years. Now you're looking to purchase this expensive sweetener for less money, right?<br /><br />Recently, Amazon has consistently amazed me by being the product price leader and the place that wins my final purchase. I'll Google the heck out of books and electronics seeking the best combination of delivered price and seller reliability. Amazon wins more often than not.<br /><br />Which is exactly why I'm so annoyed at myself for buying this 1000 count box of Splenda for $28.45.<br /><br />The day after I ordered I was in a big-box member club (four letters starting with S) where I saw, to my shock, the exact same 1,000 count box for $20.50. Yikes. I paid nearly _40% more_ the day before and thought I got a deal.<br /><br />Caveat emptor. Today on Amazon I now see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3N7AC">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener 1000 Individual Packets Value Pack (Net Wt. 2.2</a> for as low as $22.89. But the less-than-sweet moral of this story is that things may not *always* cost less on the web.

review/summary: Good Item But Costs TOO MUCH!
review/text: Sure, Splenda is a good sweetener and I have bought it here in this quantity in the past, but it costs TOO MUCH here, and I especially feel this way when I went right now and found it at the samsclub website for half as much.  Now of course, samsclub sucks because they won't ship it, but we have to pay shipping here too, so why can't the price be half as much also, or at least comparable to that?  I would even be willing to buy the generic version of Splenda, (sucralose + maltodextrin + dextrose) "Altern", but that isn't offered here either, but if it is in the future, IT SHOULD ALSO BE AT LEAST HALF THE PRICE, or more realistically, 1/4th just like it is in real life.  Anyway, I am sorry, I just wanted to gripe a little.  Sweetener should not be only for rich people.  If they were to charge that much for sugar (which it is, look it up on Wikipedia), I'm sure lots of other people would have a heart attack also (not just me).  :P  6/10

After a couple of weeks we noticed a change. He's now acting very strange, fearful, anxious and no longer the fireball he was.  Vitality should print "MADE IN CHINA" in the same large size font as the Cage Free Chicken logo on the front of their package.<br /><br />Was it the Chinese chicken that changed him?  We don't know.  We do know that we will not buy any product that is sold from Arthur Dogswell LLC, Los Angeles Ca. again.  "BUY AMERICAN PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE IN THE USA" !!!!

review/text: When I ordered this, the picture was of an 11 oz can of coffee. What showed up was not 6 cans, but rather 6 bricks of coffee. Yes, the main description read "vacuum pack", so I guess I could pay more attention. But, further down in the description it described the "flavor-lock lid". So, officially misleading. Still gave four stars as the packaging seems earth-friendly, and I expect the taste to be robust.

review/text: I was introduced to sweetened condensed milk at an early age though we always used only a spoonful of it when there was a craving and the rest of the can went to waste.  Many Southeast Asian desserts call for an entire can of the stuff.  Reading pinay cooking blogs, I noticed fresh fruit gets sweetened with this stuff but at the same time, I'm watching Ina Garten on tv spooning white chocolate sauce over berries recently purchase at the farmer's market.  She has friends coming over.  LOL.  In the past few years, I've noticed the popularity of white chocolate sauce as if WHITE chocolate sauce was a luxury foodstuff. It's got no cacao in it though.  What is white chocolate? Hmm some kind of dairy fat sugar cocoa butter and what does it taste like? Is it acrid, overly sweet, cloying?

Stick to Starbucks via and you'll only need 1 pouch and turns out to be much cheaper to buy on Amazon.

Some people don't know there is a difference between wild rice and cultivated wild rice but, there is a big difference.

review/summary: One of my favorites (but it ain't from Texas)
review/text: Texas Pete is a mild sauce that goes with a lot of foods.  I love the stuff.  But then I'm a Louisiana native and I have yet to meet a pepper I don't like.  Texas Pete has nothing to do with Texas, as has been pointed out previously, so don't expect it to be spicy like the foods you tasted in San Antonio or along the border.  It sorta fits in the same category as the various Louisiana hot sauces although it is produced in North Carolina.  It's a vinegar-based sauce, not very hot but lightly spiced with tasty peppers.<br /><br />I admit to liking lots of different hot sauces.  I keep a wide variety in the fridge and use them often.  Texas Pete is one of the milder sauces that goes well when you want just a little spice for taste but don't want too much heat.  Unless you're a masochist who has to have blisters on your tongue, you may enjoy it's lighter taste.

review/summary: Lasso some Tabasco instead!
review/text: Texas Pete's is the #1 hot sauce in the South - it's ubiquitous in every type of restaurant.  If you ask for Tabasco, you're likely to get Texas Pete's hot sauce instead.  The company was founded in 1929 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina; their first product was their barbecue sauce, but the hot sauce soon followed.  This is a basic hot sauce - peppers, vinegar, and salt - and it can be used as you would Tabasco or a Louisiana hot sauce.  Unfortunately, it's extremely mild.  I often find that, in order to add the desired heat to food, I have to add so much that the food becomes watery.  My scrambled eggs end up a mess and still taste bland.  If you like a mild hot sauce, then Texas Pete should be one of your top choices.  Otherwise, avoid this wimpy selection.<br /><br />The company's website includes a plethora of recipes using their products - the Chicken Brunswick Stew is a North Carolina tradition.

review/text: I am a huge spicy food fan!  I put hot sauce on just about everything and have tried probably a hundred different sauces.  While this one is good, I find it a bit boring compared to others.  It does add a little kick but the flavor is lacking.  There are a lot of sauces that add pure heat but either the heat is overwhelming or the flavor is completely lacking.  My number one favorite hot sauce is:<br /><br />Yucatan Sunshine Habanero Pepper Sauce -[..]<br /><br />It's about as spicy but the flavor is fantastic!  I put it on Mexican food, pasta, etc.  I always have a few bottles of this around and give them away to friends pretty regularly.

review/text: I've been making and mixing hot sauces with extra pepper ect and tweaking it for awhile now. I normally marinade for hours and make wings almost nightly for the protein.<br /><br />  Long story short, I used this sauce and the first thing I noticed was the rancid smell coming from my oven. I kept trying to tell myself it would taste good, I ended up eating as much as I could of a breast and had to throw away the rest and I also threw away the bottle of Texas Pete's. I was absolutely amazed that a hot sauce could taste so bad when cooked, absolutely the worst sauce I've ever had; stick with Franks Red Hot and Anchor Bar and you'll never be disappointed. If you want more heat at cayenne pepper :)

review/summary: from a Texan's perspective...
review/text: I have to disagree that this is the "#1 hot sauce in the South".<br /><br />Maybe certain parts of the south...<br /><br />I have lived my whole life in Texas and had never even heard of "Texas Pete's" until I travelled to D.C. (I think it's made in New Hampshire or something)<br /><br />In Texas, sauces like that are referred to as "Louisiana-sauce" because it's fairly mild, vinegar-based, and uses the cayenne pepper. In Texas we prefer spicier, more chili-based sauces and instead of the cayenne, we tend to favor the Ancho for flavor, the serrano or even habanero for heat and of course the ubiquitous jalapeno.<br /><br />I had a good laugh when I encountered this stuff.<br /><br />For some good hot sauce, try:<br /><br />Valentina<br /><br />Melinda<br /><br />Yucateca (XXX)<br /><br />Herdez<br /><br />in Houston, we have an enormous Vietnamese population, so Sriracha is also very common, even at Mexican Restaurants. We call it "Ketchup"

Don't go out of your way to find this stuff, it ain't worth it.

review/summary: Marco Polo Didn't Bring These Noodles Back from China!
review/text: They're mentioned in German Medieval sources before 1200 CE and archaeological evidence suggests that wheat noodles have been a staple of Schwabian cuisine for at least 4000 years. I'm fairly convinced this is true, since most of the packaged Spaeztle I've bought in the USA taste roughly that old. The etymology of the name is obscure, but most Schwabian housewives declare that it's derived from Schwalbe, the German name for the bird swallow. Or perhaps it's the Schwabians who are derived from Schwalben because their dialect sounds like twittering. Not a single housewife of my acquaintance has been able to suggest what the connection might be, leaving me free to speculate about the possibility that Marco Polo carried a bag of Spaetzle with him on his travels to the Khanate, where his attempts to translate the German into Chinese via Italian gave the Khan's chefs the idea of making bird's nest soup, the birds in question being swallows. However, there's also the strong possibility that all Schwabians are genetically Chinese, since their profile of frequency of blood types A and B exactly matches that of certain districts of Shanghai, which would certainly demonstrate that Marco Polo never actually traveled to China but instead heard tales of the place from various German Dudelsack players who were imprisoned with him in Genoa for disturbing the peace.<br /><br />In any case, Spaetzle are basically gnarly little egg noodles, usually served with meat dishes having rich gravies, when other cuisines might offer rice or pureed vegetables. Of course they're far better home made, but this brand is more than tolerable. There's a description of how Spaetzle are made on wikipedia, written in astounding detail, and you'll find recipes for appropriate saucy dishes on-line or in any German cookbook.<br /><br />K&ouml;stlich!

review/summary: Lightly Salted, and delicious.
review/text: I got these for my dad on Father's day. He has been trying to reduce his salt intake so I made sure to get the lightly salted pistachios. These are perfect. You can tell they have less salt then salted pistachios usually have, but they still have nice amount of salt on them. I will buy these again.
