review/summary: ENOUGH SALT TO MAKE YOUR PRESSURE GO UP!
review/text: This Campbells' soup looks good but has VERY LITTLE carrots, onions and other ingredients like the picture has and is mostly all pasta with loads of sodium/salt. Any item with over 500 mg.'s sodium in a can or container is enough salt to make your pressure go up and this has over 700 in salt packed in!  Definitely, this is one to skip and find another soup since eating half of 1 of these 15 ounces containers at a time would not fill up a kid for a snack and much less any adult.

review/summary: There's Suppose to be Chicken in This, Really?
review/text: Where's the meat? I found these have nothing but the lesser than healthy filler of rice & bits of corn. THEN you find little traces of chicken & beans floating beneath a SEA of watery tomato-like broth. I have to pour out half of the broth JUST to get anything onto the spoon because there is very little actual ingredients in the container. This is supposed to serve 2 in this tiny container of diluted broth? Seriously? I'd rather eat a smaller portion of something MUCH tastier than to waste money on these. Very unsatisfying - not worth the 220 calories. That's right, 110 x 2 for 15.3ozs with 17% of your daily sodium x2 = 34% sodium (combination of Sea salt & regular), IF you eat the ENTIRE container, which you likely do because honestly who SHARES these tiny microwave bowls of soup? So a 1/3 of your bowl if you dine solo, is composed of salt for the entire day. What a rip off. I suggest less watery, smaller portion for calorie ratio, less sodium, more chicken & less cheap filler ingredients (seriously, I got two small scraps of chicken in the WHOLE bowl).

review/summary: Eureka!
review/text: We've always wondered why the Kettle Corn we got at fairs and festivals tasted so much better than what we tried to do at home. We finally learned that Mushroom popcorn makes for a much fluffier, fuller and superior bag of Kettle Corn! Determined to surprise my fiance for the holidays, I started a quest for Mushroom popcorn kernals and finally found JustPoppin. Eureka! I quickly ordered 2 lbs, along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058IBRK6">Stainless Steel Induction Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a> and we've been poppin' up a storm ever since! It took some practice (watch their videos) -- but we quickly mastered homemade Kettle Corn and now laugh every time we pass the grocery store brands. There's simply no comparison. JustPoppin's customer service and support is terrific, too. We've been ordering from them for over a year now and enjoy trying all their new varieties, flavorings and popping techniques!

review/text: This stuff is great, I was able to make all sorts of flavored popcorn over the holidays (The mushroom shape works best for flavored popcorn).<br /><br />I do recommend using coconut oil for the popping, it gives it that taste we all love.<br /><br />I appreciated that the product came in a reseal-able bag.<br /><br />I also shopped around on the internet for this product and was glad Amazon had a partner who sells it. I was much more comfortable that I was going to get a high quality and FRESH product. And I did.

review/text: This product was extremely disappointing!  No way did it look anything like the picture and it was full of hulls.  The last time I was at a Farmers Market and purchased kettle corn, I asked them what kind of popcorn they used to get such big kernels.  I was told mushroom popcorn, so I was so excited to find this product at Amazon.  I followed the directions for popping and the kernels were no different from the corn I buy at the supermarket at a fraction of the cost!

review/text: A friend of mine gave me a small bag of this quality corn for my birthday and it is AMAZING! He knew I am a avid fan of popcorn and am always searching for something new. He did mention the hulls and said "So long as you chew it and NOT try to inhale it, it would be good" and good it was. I only stove top so it was great to see the corn pop up so big, just a handful and it filled up a 24qt bowl (Cause you can't eat good popcorn in a small bowl). Lightly seasoned to taste with salted butter and seasoning salt, Perfect! So I only wrote cause of the knuckleheads that bad mouthed something that I thoroughly enjoyed. Buy a small sample and see for yourself and don't let others keep you from the good stuff...

review/summary: Just as described as long as you follow the instructions.
review/text: I bought a 3lb bag and had it sent to my parents.  They raved that it came out great so I bought a 5lb bag myself.  I have tried it once so far.  I popped 1/4 cup with 1 1/2 tbs of butter flavored canola oil in the 6 qt Lindy's popper.  I followed the instructions that states that you should only toss in a few kernels at the beginning while the oil heats up.  When those three pop, dump in the rest since the oil will be at optimum temperature.  I did so and started to crank away.  All the kernels popped in about 10 seconds since it was a small batch.  Came out fine, but a little chewier than expected because since the kernels were fuller than regular butterfly popcorn.  It did get a little crispier when more steam was allowed to escape.  Flavor was fine with a light bit of popcorn salt.

review/text: As claimed in ads this corn is for added flavoring such as caramel. If purchased for popping and eating 'as-is' you'll discover wonderfully huge corn puffs with NO TASTE. The ads are correct, buy to flavor or not I'm not intentionally criticizing this corn, the mistake I made was assuming it would taste as great as it looks, without caramel.

review/text: This Wilton pearlized gold sugar looks like very pretty real gold. I was a little worried that in person this sugar would look like a yellow, mustardy gold.  It doesn't.  I used it to sprinkle on whipped cream so the color was important to me.  I also used it to rim some champagne glasses before adding Champagne, St. Germaine, A touch of ginger-ale and a smidge of fresh lemon juice.  The drink was of course delicious on it's own, but the gold sugar really took it to another level and made it beautiful and a topic of conversation. Surprisingly, a little goes a long way, so while this was a little expensive with the shipping cost, I'll find many uses for it.

I bought this product because I wanted a quick hot breakfast, and unfortuantely, many stores in the DC metro area do not seem to carry this hot cereal. Thankfully, Amazon does. I love the wheaty taste of the cereal, and I tend to add milk and sugar to give it a nice smooth and sweet flavor. Delicious. If you enjoy hot cereals, like oatmeal or Cream of Wheat, I highly recommend that you try Malt-O-Meal. And if you have children, I'd recommend sharing this with them as well. It could provide some warm fond memories at the breakfast table.

review/summary: An Authentic Taste of Savona
review/text: I really enjoyed this product.  I had tasted authentic chinotto while on vacation in Italy, and wanted to enjoy it here in America after I returned.  An Italian friend living in the States told me about the San Pellegrino product, and I ordered a case, since I already enjoyed their bottled water.  I was very happy with it.  It is not identical to the brand I drank in Savona, but just as good (think Coke versus Pepsi).  My family members loved it, too, and it got used up much faster than I would have liked.  It's certainly not cheap, but it's easily worth it, if you love the taste of chinotto.<br /><br />For those who haven't tasted it, chinotto is a citrus drink which is so dark, thick, and balsamic, that it actually tastes somewhat like Coke or Dr. Pepper.  Very nice stuff.  I also have some chinotto fragrance that I bought in Savona, and it has that same rich, wonderful smell.  The bottles are small by American standards, but the product is very nice, and really should be sipped, not chugged.  This stuff probably makes excellent and very novel mixed drinks, too.

All of the bean project soups are easy to prepare and the best part is that they come with the most perfect seasonings!

review/text: This is a very smooth coffee!<br />I usually use a french press, 4 scoops for 2 cups @ 4 minutes.<br /><br />The flavor is smooth, and like the other reviewer said a little on the light side, which can make it very crisp, as I've experienced, in a drip-type coffee maker. (this is a very good thing!)<br />It has some subtle earthy-tones to it as well, and leave a pleasant flavor in your mouth for minutes after drinking.<br />Like all coffee- the way you make it will bring out different flavor profiles, and temperature as well. Higher temperature will bring out more acidity and crispness, lower temperature brings out more 'bold' and 'smooth'. That's 175-190 degrees f.<br />Both ends of the spectrum, and all in between, are good, with this particular variety. You can't say that with all of them.<br />I would recommend this brand to others- fair trade and organic at a pretty decent price.

review/summary: another awesome coffee
review/text: This is the fourth coffee i have purchased from paramount. I will only get organic and fair trade because i care about where my coffee comes from, how its grown and the people who grow it. The flavor of this coffee is something i feel that an everyday coffee drinker can enjoy. It is on the lighter side, not any true distinct flavors. Just an all around crisp cup o joe. I will be buying this again. I would recommend to other.

review/text: The product arrived quickly and in great condition.  I like the ingredients are just apples...no vitamin C, Ascorbic acid...just apples.  These are convenient snacks on the go.  My two year old can drink the applesauce from the pouch like using a straw.  We've experienced no messes, no problems.  Have also added it to cups of flax milk and coconut milk to help satisfy hunger.

review/summary: coffeelicious!!
review/text: I've always loved coffee cordials, but they are fairly difficult to find anywhere--stores usually have chocolate-covered coffee beans, but NOT coffee cordials, which have a clear, coffee-flavored liquid in the center of the dark chocolate shell. When I found Amazon.com had them, I bought a 5-lb bag for Christmas! They did not last long! They were so yummy! I'll be ordering again for sure.

review/summary: Stale Candy Sucks!
review/text: Koppers Coffee Cordials are nearly the perfect chocolate confection. If a buyer wants candies that will make his widdle toes curl, go to the Koppers site where there are unbelievable varieties of liquid center in a hard sugar shell, covered with the richest, silkiest dark chocolate in the world. Mmmmm. The price is high, though, so I jumped at Amazon's "bargain" price. What I got, however, weren't really cordials since most had dried out and the liquid had turned to sugar. Even dried out they're delicious, but they're NOT DIVINE~

review/text: It's always hard to stick to rating the product itself when you see something you really think should be pointed out. My cat loves these treats every bit as much as he loves Greenies. Maybe even a little more.<br /><br />Here's the reason for my one-star-rating-to-attract-attention-to-this-listing:<br /><br />The price I'm seeing for these treats in this particular listing is absolutely ridiculous. I can get a 3.0 oz bag at Walmart or Target for $1.50 or $1.60. This seller doesn't even come close.

review/text: The Blissful Catnip Temptations treats are wonderful and the only ones my cat will eat. They are off petstore shelves and grocery stores in a matter of hours, and that's why I came to Amazon.com to order. Just be careful who you order from! The company I eventually used priced the treats reasonably at $1.72 per package; the other company (NYCPETSUPPLY), which is the first listed, was/is selling them for a whopping $4.99 per package (a ripoff of monumental preportions, if not downright criminal), and if you're lucky you can find them in some pet and grocery stores for $1.68. My cat loves them so much I have to hide them in order to get her to eat something else.

review/summary: Bad pricing
review/text: Just so you all know these are $7.50 at Wal-Mart so I recommend you don't buy these. But yet on the other hand this could also look like a good deal because if you buy these out of a vending machine they could cost as much as $1.00 a pouch which would equal $36.00 for all of these. So you are basically getting these half off if you use vending machines a lot. But if you get these at Wal-Mart it's like getting 2 big cases which is (72) pouches for the current price of "one" box on here which is ($16.94). Just be smart while shopping on here and compare prices in the store before you buy online. Happy shopping.

review/text: While expensive compared to powdered formula, these bottles do offer easy feedings on the go. Sometimes it is just much easier to crack one of these open instead of mix water and formula when I am out. They keep easily in a diaper bag, purse, etc. Price is comparable to local stores. As another review mentioned, the consistency of the liquid is thicker and stains more than powdered formula.

review/summary: Party Favors
review/text: I was actually looking for some cool but unique favors to put in my soon to be 5 year old son's loot bags for his Superhero Birthday party in school. I actually came across the Pez dispensers first, but then through just looking around, stumbled on these cute Klik dispensers, which were cheaper and to be honest, I think they totally look better than the Pez dispensers! Now I know there are hardcore Pez collectors out there, but these are 4 and 5 year old little kids, and they don't care about all that.<br />My only gripe, and its really slight is that pictured are Spiderman, Iron Man, and Wolverine. What I got was Spiderman, Iron Man, and Captain America. This was all fine, but 12 come in each box; I ordered two. Both have 6 Spiderman, 4 Captain America and 2 Iron Man. Shouldn't it be four of each? However, because I can read and I inspect carefully before purchasing, I realize that a side note says product may not be as pictured, and you may not get the same number of each character in each box.

review/summary: Memories of childhood
review/text: Every year for Christmas our Grandparents from Germany sent a tin from Germany. The arrival signaled the holiday season had officially begun. This holiday season for sentimental reason I purchased this tin and have placed it as shrine on the sideboard in my DR Christmas display. Can't wait for my family to gather this Sunday! There were a few favorites that are no longerin the tin, and since the cost was only slightly higher I can see that adjustments were made in product to avoid drastic increase in price. I was soo happy to find a perpetual calendar that will be a treasured keepsake that will take a prominent place on my wall. I am giddy to be adding the keepsake chest to the ones that were given from my childhood. This year cements the restart of a traditionas I want to be able to hand these chests down to my children - the one thing prominent in all my siblings homes are our Schmidt Festive Chests. Do Not let the price turn you away the quality and quantity of the goodies enjoyed this holiday are only paled by the memory of the chest. I display my prominently all year long, and guess what? I have a tree full of very delicate ornaments which I never worry about being broken because-yes, you guessed it-I pack ornaments in one, my porcelain Nativity in another, and have started an antique santa collection which is lookinfor a yearround home-so problem solved.<br /><br />BUY THIS YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!!!

The gingerbread recipes are very different from American types-the bread is moist and flavorful without any overpowering strange flavors. You could eat any of these as a snack before or after breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, late-night, whenever. This is the second time receiving this large container from friends of ours and I can't brag enough about them to friends and family. I hope this review helps....they are excellent.

It has a nice espresso finish, but no bitterness, just a perfect blend. I not only eat this chocolate out of hand, but I also bake with it, and use it to make chocolate ice cream. You could not ask for better results. To summarize, this is a very unique, complex chocolate with a nice round taste, and tons of depth. Highly recommended.

Single origin chocolate is definitely a different, better breed and anything in this line - all unique and all very distinctive, flavorful and positively gorgeous - are good choices. Also, remember that any recipe that calls for 70% could use even the 65% Santander too - Get into the 55% Santander and it's more of a semi-sweet use, but let me tell you, it's the most muscular semi I've ever tasted. These are all wonderful eating or cooking chocolates - truly the earmark of a good chocolate product.

review/summary: Totally unlike any other high-end chocolate
review/text: I've purchased every available 70+% chocolate the past two weeks, and the Santander 70% stands head and shoulders above the rest.  Most of the others are good or very good, but the differences are subtle.  One bite of the Santander and you'll go "Wow! - it has an impossible-to-describe complex flavor totally unlike any of the others.  I'm kind of surprised it's not better known.

review/summary: Even eaten in Colombia!
review/text: Unlike a lot of exported goods from Colombia, Santander is actually SOLD in Colombia. I lived there for a year and it was on my grocery list every week. It is sooooooo good, so much better than any dark chocolate I have had in the US or Europe. It's got a rich, smooth texture and a complex but very satisfying flavor. I love it. I'm home again now and have to order it because I can't find anything else that compares (including Askinosie, which is from my college town). I also sampled chocolate while traveling in Ecuador, and I don't think the flavor of their beans compares to Colombia's.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Stunning, superb chocolate formulation
review/text: Purely by chance, this was the first taste I had of single-origin chocolate, and of Colombian chocolate.<br /><br />This chocolate is so good, I am surprised Colombia bothers with coffee or cocaine. ;-)<br /><br />Though this is a strongly flavored dark chocolate, it is NOT bitter, just RICH with a 'roasted' taste that is unique. I immediately recognized a familiar flavor from some exotic European chocolates I'd tried before, but never could define. Here it was, an entire bar of it...<br /><br />I have used this as the primary chocolate in baking a complex chocolate torte, and the character (melted gently) remained in the baked result. For a practiced dessert expert this will become a secret ingredient you treasure.<br /><br />But enjoy it just for the amazing character it has - I happily give it 5 stars - it can not be improved upon.

These chip shop curry granules are fantastic sprinkled on all kinds of things for a flavorful extra zing. My personal favorites are on mashed potatoes, french fries (er, I mean chips), chicken and fish, shrimp, rice, and noodles. I'll bet there are lots of foods I haven't tried it on yet that it does well on. Gives a little bit of curry bite without going through the procedure of preparing real curry.

review/summary: As a soon to be dental hygienist, this product is terrific!
review/text: This gum contains xylitol as one of its main ingredients. I am currently in dental hygiene school and thus have recently learned the benefits of xylitol. The reason this is so good is that it is a natural sweetener that tricks bacteria into thinking it's regular sugar. When bacteria ingest it they have no way to digest it, which results in death of the bacteria and therefore lowers your risk for cavities when used daily.<br /><br />Now for anyone who has TMJ issues (if you don't have TMJ, then you don't have to bother reading this one paragraph) it is recommended that you not chew gum at all. I myself am one of these people. Whenever I chew gum my jaw ends up hurting for days. However, I spoke with the dentist at my college about this issue and he actually recommends to continue chewing xyliotol gum but to only chew for 5 minutes maximum, particularity after sugary snacks only. For myself, this seems to work. If I eat something high in sugar and chew Spry gum for only 5 minutes afterward, it'll help get the xyliotol in my mouth to fight off cavity causing bacteria but won't be long enough to cause me pain in my jaw.<br /><br />Overall, if you're one who gets cavities often, try Spry gum!

review/summary: Xylitol Cinnamon gumXylitol
review/text: Xylitol, besides being an innocuous non sugar substitute (in contrast with some other sugar substitutes), also has the benefit of being an anti-cavity anti-bacterial, although how strong I don't know.  In addition, the cinnamon<br />flavor is delicious, and while the sweetness doesn't last, the hint of cinnamon flavor does. Altogether, a very worthwhile product.

review/summary: Great for both Dental & Budget Heath!
review/text: I first made this product a recurring purchase about 9 months ago, after realizing the benefit of frequent gum-chewing. (I took to chewing several times per day - typically after meals when tooth-brushing isn't practical).<br /><br />Went from buying cinnamon Altoids gum at Trader Joe's, to buying this Spry brand from xlear.com, then switched my buying to Amazon.com, when I saw the potential cost savings.<br /><br />What can I say? Useful product at a good price from a reliable retailer - all at a lower cost than ever. Can't ask for more than that!<br /><br />My only "word of caution" would be: if you're single & don't share your gum a lot or if you just don't chew so often, you may find the product hardening over time; something that can't be helped, of course. Solutions? Chew more gum, be more generous, or buy a smaller tub. (c:

review/text: I'm a huge fan of natural cinnamon gum, and have attracted many coworkers to it from this large container sitting on my desk. This gum lasts rather long before disintegrating, and retains a hint of cinnamon after losing its initial sweetness fades. The texture is consistently stiff, and gives a nice jaw workout should one chew constantly (I like to suck on it and chew intermittently). I recommend buying a pack from a local health food store for six bits to sample before committing to a large pack. Other flavors have been good as well.

review/text: I have tried a few other all natural gums before this one, but this gum is the best value in my opinion. There is no downside to it and it is the most affordable all natural gum I have found. There are 4 qualities I look for when purchasing gum: 1 - it tastes good; 2 - the taste lasts an adequate time; 3 - it uses all natural ingredients; 4 - it is a good value for the money. This gum meets all of these criteria. I just wish I found it sooner.

review/summary: Love Spry, love cinnamon, can't tolerate this gum
review/text: First, I love Spry gum...high % of xylitol per serving, no gross/weird ingredients, great flavor. The flavor may fade a little faster than some conventional chewing gums, but it's better than consuming the carcinogenic, disgusting artificial ingredients they use. Also, this is an amazing value for Spry gum...previously I was ordering the 100 pc. tubs from a popular online herb store; that worked out to about $1.10 more per 100 pieces. At local health food stores, a 100 piece tub is even more expensive at about $7-7.5 each before tax! This is a good value anyway, as I have seen tubs of conventional chewing gum cost more than this per 100 pcs. The only thing is, I can not tolerate the cinnamon flavor for some reason! I can eat cinnamon no problem in other foods, but this gum triggers canker sores for me. I keep forgetting that and order it now and then because I like cinnamon gum, but it's really a bad idea for me :(

review/summary: Outstanding with one small negative (being fixed)
review/text: I purchased this product fully aware of the fact that the company uses titanium dioxide in its manufacture.  There seem to be different opinions, but from what I could tell there does not seem to be any significant problem with the tiny amount of titanium dioxide in the product, so I purchased it.  I spoke with the company first, and was informed that they are working on the same product without that ingredient, but they didn't have a firm roll-out date.<br /><br />Taste is great, it lasts, and it's sugarless without the (reported) harmful effects of Splenda, Aspartame, saccharin, etc.  We've done our own research and would not consider any of those, whereas the benefits of Xylitol appear to be great and without any harmful consequences.  We love it!<br /><br />It's just nice to know I have a pleasant chewing gum that is also not contributing to tooth decay or gum disease (and may even be helping to prevent both, according to some reports).<br /><br />This is worth just a hair shy of 5 stars, and that's a rating we rarely give unless a product is "over the top" great.  This is close.<br /><br />Note: Try finding ANY chewing gum in local grocery or drug stores that don't have Splenda or Aspartame in them - good luck!  Buy this instead, with its far lower price than at local "health food" stores where they charge much higher prices, and generally only carry small quantities.

review/text: I bought the Lemon-flavored mints before and was quite pleased. Decided to try this gum and was looking forward to a similar experience (read somewhere that cinnamon is good for your breath). You live and learn. I've found out that I am one of the few (or many?) people who have an allergic reaction to cinnamon. It was fine at first but after about a week of using the gum (three to four pieces daily), I developed tiny sores on my tongue and much bigger ones on the insides of my cheeks. Stopped taking the gum and it cleared up in about a week. Tried two pieces after it had mostly gone, and had a mild reaction within hours. Very disappointed, but it's not the product's fault really. Should've tried a smaller jar first, and probably should have googled "cinnamon allergy," due diligence is so important when parting with cash. Will have to give away the rest now.
