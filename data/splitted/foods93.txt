review/summary: FIRST TIME BUY AND WE LOVE THEM!
review/text: I was so excited to try these.  I am trying to find economical GOOD for you food.  I ate one of these and a cup of Joe and I was full. Delicious!  Heated it 20 seconds. That of course is unfrozen.  I immediately froze the rest to keep them fresh as no preservatives in them. I think you have to heat it about 40 seconds when frozen.  My son had one (He is 21) and he had to have two to fill him.  He likes them a lot. My Mom had one and she was full.  She could not quit talking about how good they are. Another reason  I also wanted to try these is because my Mom has Alzheimers and cannot cook on stove safely anymore. She likes to snack and get things herself so these are perfect.  She can still use the microwave. I feel these are healthy eating and that makes me feel good. We all have medical disabilities so the easier the better. The really cool part is that they are just a little over a 1.00 each for breakfast! We love the Morning Glory and am fixing to order more with Amazon Prime. By the way for those of you who don't know about Prime, it is wonderful and we have saved so much on shipping this year. Also, it is quick 2 day free shipping and 3,95 for overnight.  I try to only buy products that have Prime on them. Our cookies came today (a Saturday) with Prime 2 day by Fed Ex. That is another thing I love is shipping is free with Prime on these. If you shop  a lot on Amazon (which I am doing more and more) the 70.00 is a great value for a years membership. Gotta order more cookies now! Blessings!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/7/10:  I HAVE READ COMMENTS THAT SOME PEOPLE HAD THESE GET MOULD ON THEM. PLEASE REMEMBER TO FREEZE THESE AS THEY HAVE NO PRESERVATIVES.  THERE IS A NOTE  ON WHITE PAPER FROM ERIN BAKER IN EACH PACKAGE WHICH SUGGESTS  YOU DO THIS AND WHY.  JUST HATE TO SEE ERIN GET BASHED FOR THIS WHEN IT IS NOT HER FAULT. MINE GO IN THE FREEZER AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVE. THAT WAY THEY ARE ALWAYS FRESH. STILL LOVE THESE COOKIES!<br /><br /> I AM NOW ON MONTHLY AUTOMATIC MAILING SO WE HAVE THEM EVEN IF I FORGET TO ORDER ON TIME. THAT WAY IT IS EVEN LESS EXPENSIVE. HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG? GREAT BARGAIN FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TO WATCH OUR PENNIES.<br /><br />MY MOM (who has alzheimers) LOVES THEM SO MUCH I HATE TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I QUIT ORDERING THEM. SHE TALKS ABOUT THEM ALL THE TIME . SHE WAS FEELING SO DOWN AS SHE CANNOT COOK MUCH AT ALL ANYMORE AND  SINCE THESE THEY ARE EASY FOR HER TO HEAT IN THE MICROWAVE, IT MAKES HER FEEL BETTER ABOUT HERSELF. THANK YOU ERIN!

review/summary: Uh, it's just "okay"
review/text: I purchased these with high hopes because I do not seem to have enough time to eat a great breakfast, but I thought this would provide sustenance 'til lunchtime; however, I was disappointed after a few bites. While the cookie is wholesome and filling, it does have a slight aftertaste.  To me it seemed like "something" was missing...not sure what, since there are many good ingredients, but I think I would have enjoyed apple/cinnamon much better.<br /><br />Also, I also found it disturbing that even though my cookies were not frozen (probably should have done this since they are a moist cookie) and not yet expired (January 2011), they were stored on the pantry shelf, as they are individually wrapped...but they became moldy. Yep. I just threw away three cookies because I could see mold through the package (opened one to confirm it). Yuck.

review/text: I love the mix of flavors in this cookie.  The cookies are very moist and they are also very filling. The only thing I didn't like about these is the strong nutmeg taste.  Unfortunately, nutmeg is not my favorite spice.  I would have enjoyed more raisins but my kids are glad there aren't that many.  I love the fact that I can keep these handy for mornings when we are running late and for when we take trips.  They are easy to freeze and seem to keep rather well in the freezer.

review/text: If I hadn't scored these during a Warehouse sell-off, I'd even more seriously fail to understand how or why anyone could justify paying over a dollar a piece for these things. Sure, the instructions are dead-on with the freeze-before-toasting method, but they have more ingredients than healthy cookies I can make at home for MUCH cheaper, and with superior texture and without the garbage. If you think these are healthy OR a good value, you've been duped.

review/text: We picked these up based on the glowing reviews. My fault, my mistake. I believe they are WAY over-rated. Doesn't taste morning glory at all. Instead, tastes just like any one of the other in the line ... dry, stale, dense, oatmeal "cookie," like a cookie experiment gone bad by a pre-teen.<br /><br />In addition, cookies arrived cracked, broken and sticking to bag, yet are dry & stale inside. What a waste. I would have never purchased these in a B&M store had I had an opportunity to examine them first.

review/summary: I love Kopali Products!!!
review/text: After purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIWUHG">Kopali goldenberries</a>, I tried a few other Kopali snacks: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIRCZ6">chocolate covered cacao nibs</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIWUTE">chocolate covered banana</a>.<br /><br />The goldenberries are the best dried fruit I have ever had. They are bursts of sweet and tangy flavor and achieve the same satisfaction as sour gummies. Grown in Columbia, goldenberries are high in antioxidants, bioflavonoids, fiber, and even contain protein. They are a great snack and are somewhat filling.<br /><br />The dark chocolate covered nibs are also good. The small package contains a lot more nibs than it seems at first. The nibs are crunchy, high in antioxidants, and a little bit bitter, but the dark chocolate balances the bitterness nicely.<br /><br /> The chocolate covered bananas were also delicious. I expected them to be crispy, but instead they were chewy and a bit zesty. Each of the Kopali Organics products is a healthy and satisfying snack. You should try them (especially the goldenberries)!

The only disappointment that I have is that you can't buy them at every Whole Foods.

review/text: These bite sized banana pieces are delicious.  They are covered in dark chocolate and are chewy (the bananas are not fried or crispy and banana chips typically are).  These chocolate covered bananas are vegan, organic, and fair trade, and while they are a bit pricey (the bags are small and won't last too long because these are delicious), they are a unique treat which makes it worth purchasing.  These aren't too sweet - they have a hint of sweetness from the chocolate and banana, but are a tad bitter from the dark chocolate.

Unfortunately, the nuts I received had somehow absorbed a strong taste of plastic.  I took them out of the plastic tubs they were packed in and put them in another container I use that does not transfer odors or tastes onto the food.  Even so, after several weeks these nuts still tasted very unpleasantly of plastic.

review/summary: Sesmark Sesame  Rice Thins
review/text: The product is a known value to us and is fresh. The physical condition of the  product leaves something to be desired. The individual wafers are often broken up, to the extent of 30% of the contents of the package. This indicates careless packing for the rigors of package shipment. The use of a somewhat larger outside box with the air bag padding on all sides should be better for the physical care of the contents. My wife eats the thins for lunch very often with meat, cheese or fish and finds the broken ones unsatisfactory.

review/text: The bamboo arrived about 2 weeks after ordering, all intact and well packed.  However, there were no instructions for caring of the bamboo.  It is now almost a month since arriving and part of the bamboo stalk looks like it is dying and turning brown (part of the heart shape).  I would buy more from this company if the shipping wasn't so costly (for the area where I live the shipping was about $10 and the product itself $15).

review/summary: AN OLD-FASHIONED CANDY...
review/text: When I was young, nearly a half century ago, Chuckles was a very popular candy. I really enjoyed eating these jellied treats, which were dusted with granulated sugar,  as they definitely satisfied a sweet tooth. I still enjoy them on occasion, though they are not as easy to find as in the old days, having waned somewhat in popularity. My particular favorite was the cherry flavor. If they had sold an all cherry pack, I would have bought them by the ton. Luckily for me, an all cherry pack was not available.  I also enjoyed the licorice and orange flavors. Lemon and lime, however,  were the flavors that I liked least, so I would benevolently offer them to my younger sisters. I was all heart in those days.

review/text: You're crazy if you don't have a soft spot for Chuckles.  You know darn well that they were one of your favorites as a kid, and you can't resist a package (or two) even today.  I love the Cherry flavored, and wish that they would introduce a Red-only package of Chuckles (if only for a limited edition, and boy would I hold on to a few of those for posterity).  A tip for you Chuckles-lovers-- freeze 'em!  They last a lot longer that way and are well complimented by your favorite non-caloric beverage (we ladies need to watch our expanding figures, unless the stork is on the way).  God Bless Chuckles.

review/summary: Great product, and no problems with delivery.
review/text: I ordered this product because i love pasta but need to start modifying my diet because i want to start fighting competitively again and need to get myself back to peak performance. I was skeptical from all the talk of "fishy smell and taste". Thus being the reason i ordered the single pack. I prepared them as instructed and prepared them into a soup. I used chicken breasts cut into strips, boiled them into a broth with sliced carrots, green onions, and broccoli, and then poured it into the bowl over the noodles. Me and my girlfriend tried it and it turned out great. She put some soy sauce in hers because she liked it better that way, but we both loved it. It did not have the fish smell after rinsing, nor while eating it. The texture is comparable to the rice noodles you find in Vietnamese and Japanese dishes. I am a convert to miracle noodle. I fed two people off of one pack, not bad i say. Also noticed the difference in the curving of my snack urges(didn't even touch my yogurt, orange, or nature valley peanut butter bar until near the end of my shift at work), and could wait longer before i took my lunch at work. I work 10 hour night shifts, so that's why i ate this before work. These are a great tool into any nutrition plan in my book.

review/summary: Where's The Carbs and Calories?
review/text: My daughter and I ordered these "noodles" from Amazon when we were on a diet.  I am diabetic, so they were doubly useful for me.  I read the reviews and found that the advice to rinse throughly and season heavily is the best way to prepare them.. I bought the angel hair and the rice.  We did not care for the rice.  I prepared the angel hair by cooking it dry in a pan with chopped onions..cook it for a good while.  I then added spaghetti sauce and cooked chicken and simmered it for some more time.  It was not like a meal at an Italian restaurant; but when you consider the caloeies and carbs being saved, it was quite palatable.  The only thing I really missed was the buttered garlic bread!  We gritted our teeth and ate another serving of the angel hair.<br /><br />Another plus; the website for the noodles has a lot of info and good advice.

review/summary: Interesting product
review/text: I ordered these noodles after seeing them advertised on the Internet. I was a little surprised to see that the noodles were in a bag of water, but I went along cooking with them anyway. I rinsed, blanched and dried them like the package said, and put them in about half a cup of smooth tomato sauce. The noodles involved a little more chewing than I expected (and the texture is a little different), but it was enough to feed one adult such as myself and I liked that the noodles have 0 calories. I might purchase these again, perhaps when I have a better recipe to include them in, such as a soup.

review/summary: FYI- BEFORE YOU BUY Miracle Noodles PLEASE READ THIS!
review/text: I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: [...]. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz "Angel hair" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that "THIS IS OUR POLICY" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ "Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all! What's that tell you???

review/text: This is a pretty nice starter kit for the price.  My only complaint would be the light damage done to my tree by the display box that it was obviously in for too long.  But just a few months later, and my bonsai is doing just great now!  There is new green growth on the old damaged branches, which is nice.  Still, overall a good deal for the price.  Would make a great gift!<br /><br />Ok, it's been 5 months now, and the tree is doing absolutely great!!  I woudn't worry AT ALL about how I said it came in the box... very strong and dependable tree regardless.  I'm VERY pleased with this tree, and it's now been moved to a bigger pot as it's doing so well!!  By far my FAVORITE of my 8 different bonsai trees ordered online!!<br /><br />Almost a year now, and still growing strong!  I've had three other bonsai plants die from different companies, but this one continues to thrive!  I'm now using the small pot it originally came in for another bonsai.. yes the pot it comes with is small, but it's very durable and great for starting small bonsai or other plants.  I'd still strongly recommend this starter kit to anyone interested in starting the art of bonsai.. and even for experienced growers.  It's such a wonderful kit.  The tree is healthy, the pot is durable, and the soil works great!

review/summary: Bonsai made easy for Westerners
review/text: I ordered the Bonsai Tree Startere Kit and have been very pleasantly satisfied. I was initially a little suspicious about ordering a live tree to be delivered by mail, but thought that for the price and my interest level, it was worth the risk. I am glad that I took the risk. The tree arrived in great shape and the directions for transplanting and caring for it were very easy to follow and clear. My little bonsai tree has made a very nice addition to my home alter, where I keep it for daily meditation. I would encourage anyone with an interest in bonsai but without the skill set to start on your own to consider this product. This makes a very easy entry into Bonsai, which was, at least for me, a little intimidating.

I was a little upset at first because this product wasn't eligible for prime but despite that the plant still arrived in 2 days after shipment. Everything was in place and the plant was lively and not damaged. Came with easy to follow instructions and guide. Would definitely recommend for the price.

review/text: For starters, the tree came surprisingly fast and looked beautiful. It came in perfect condition. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that unfortunately, they did not send the ceramic pot. We live in Missouri and it was already 3:15 so we were not able to call. I will update when I call. I'm not saying it's a bad product, it's great! It's just that they made a tiny mistake. If you're looking for a good starter kit, this is it!

review/text: So if you have ever bought Bertie Bots you know you get almost nothing for the price.  But I love these flavors so much that I kept searching until I stumbled onto Weasley Wizard Beans and I was VERY happy I did.<br /><br />Like the other reviewer it is quite fun to leave these out for kids and see the expression on their face when they get a gross flavor, but actually some strange ones are actually good, like grass and soap if you ask me.

review/summary: Good diet cereal
review/text: This is a good high fiber breakfast cereal with a high protein content.  It does contain some sodium, but has a good potassium/sodium ratio.  It has some sugar content (evaporated cane juice) and a good flavor.  It generally is found in health food sections of larger supermarkets or in health food stores, and is now available on the Internet.  My main complaint is that retailers do not generally carry the hot cereal equivalent (which I managed to get my friend Lisa to carry in her health food store).

review/text: This has recently become my staple breakfast cereal. After trying many high on taste low on nutrition cereals, I decided to find one that fits my needs. I am a regular at the gym so I have to watch what I eat. This one is not only high in protein and fiber, but also tastes much better that the other similar cereals with high fiber.<br />It can easily become addictive as it has the right balance between taste and nutrition.<br />The price is affordable too and the product can be easily found in grocery stores.

Try grinding it in the blender and mixing the crumbs with natural peanut butter and honey.  Make into balls and serve--great for a snack for adults or kids.

review/summary: Italian Sausage Success
review/text: This is a great blend for Italian Sausage. It makes a mild sausage with a little kick. It does 50 lbs of sausage and I make it in 10 lb batches. I measured the level of the blend(5") and with a permanent marker made lines every inch on the container for my 10 lbs of meat. I ground up my shoulders, mixed in the spices, then reground a second time. Some of the best sausage I have ever had. Tastes like NY style sausage with the fennel in it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking to save money on sausage. I estimated I have about 1.75 a pound into it where store bought is over 3.50 a pound. It is also very healthy. I will be purchasing other blends in the future to also try.

review/summary: Mild/Hot Italian Sausage seasoning
review/text: We followed the directions closely for a 10 lb. mix of 1/2 venison and 1/2 pork. (We did mix the seasoning directly into the meat, then added a bit of water.) We then let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.  We fried some patties up the next morning to taste test.<br /><br />The pepper seasoning came through, not excessively so, but it did linger a bit.  I have been known to like things hot (although my tastes have mellowed with age) and I would rate this between mild and medium.  I have tasted commercially prepared breakfast sausage that tasted hotter.  It definitely makes this a great sausage for using in spaghetti and other italian dishes.  By itself, the sausage is very flavorable.  We plan to pack 1/2 into casings and bulk store the rest for cooking Italian dishes.<br /><br />I do agree with one reviewer, it is a bit salty tasting and could be toned down a bit.  But, it is within the limits for a spicy sausage and will be fine used in other Italian recipes, IMHO.<br /><br />I would buy this again, but back off of the amount to mix into the meat (due to the salt) and add other Italian seasonings.

review/summary: Good sardines!  But Ignorant Reviewers!
review/text: This is the only brand I've been able to buy from any market that uses EXTRA VIRGIN Olive Oil. Most brands use cheaper non-virgin olive oil.<br /><br />I use a can of this stuff over leafy green salad and throw in a few cherry tomatoes. Shake it up and you have delicious high protein salad with no need for saturated fat/carb stuffed dressings.<br /><br />As for the other reviewers, they are entitled to their opinions, but I need to throw out a bit of education: The reason that these Sardines are not processed in the United States is because THERE ARE NO MORE SARDINE processors in the United States. The last one was in Maine and it closed down in 2010 - this was big news already. The reasons for this are multiple: California's Sardine processing crashed after overfishing of California Sardines ruined the industry in CA for a while. The cost of buying American processed Sardines was too high of a price for Americans, who simply opted to buy the stuff processed in Morocco and Portugal.<br /><br />Blaming this particular company for sending off the fish to Vietnam is misplaced criticism. Blame yourselves for not buying American to save money only to complain about it later.<br /><br />Seriously people.

review/summary: I'm an official lover of Sardines
review/text: A good range of reviews here. I especially like the one that seeks to educate. That is unfortunate there are no more canneries here in the States.<br /><br />Here's my reality:<br /><br />I believe this company is out to put out quality products. And if your really concerned about their business practice do some due diligence. They have a website.<br /><br />I stopped for years eating anything out of a can. And for a single person I can't afford buying wild fish in bulk. I love the fact that this company puts out this product. Being of a Pacific Island decent (born and raised in the U.S  and proud to buy american) the food my ethnic community eats is a horrible combination with all that msg and salt. Not all asians eat vegetables. Particularly Filipino's. They fry everything and eat too much bread. It's the spanish influence. I respect their dietary choices but it didn't work for me.<br /><br />About 10 years ago I gradually shifted my health. I believe in moderation. And I do research the companies I buy from. I've never considered sardines. Then I tried the Sardines in Olive Oil and I am hooked.<br /><br />I study the health benefits of all things. I've been doing it for 10 years now. I study psychology and do yoga.<br /><br />Health first comes from your mind. It comes down to testing and learning what your body likes. It doesn't help to scare people into health. It doesn't work in the long run. I've met health freaks that worry so much about the negatives that it physiologically affects their health. There is such thing as too much information. You have to enjoy what you eat. Simple.<br /><br />I eat this stuff out of the can. The flavor is fantastic. It's great with some brown rice and veggies. I haven't quite made the transition to totally raw and I don't think I ever will but this is the next best thing.<br /><br />Price is not comparable to the price of your health. Most don't know how to measure that. The way I watch people waste their money on things like eating out, booze and claim they save money to buy one dollar microwaveable meals doesn't compare. Those "frugal" individuals suffer long term when they get older. They are the same people that poke fun at folks like me who take supplements and do yoga. I see a long term investment that most people tend to neglect: YOUR BODY! Your health needs to balance on ALL levels: mind and body. That's when you reap the benefits.<br /><br />If you want great healthy food for an affordable price and still support the planet, then support this company. Your body in the long run will thank you for it.

review/text: These are some of the best tasting sardines we have ever had and the size is very impressive. There are about four large taste sardines per can.  I was lucky to get these from Amazon when they had them in stock it they came quickly and the the use by date is two years away, not that they will last that long as they are so good just right out of the can that we nearly eaten up our order. The sardines are caught off of California, but processed elsewhere just in case your wondering but as another reviewer noted try finding a processor in the US is almost impossible, even here in the Monterey Bay.  In closing great sardines, but wait till Amazon has them in stock for a great price.

review/summary: Deconstructing Environmental Cred
review/text: There's nothing really wrong with these sardines, though as noted below I don't particularly care for their smoky taste. My problem is with the marketing, which attempts to justify an inflated price with a dissertation of a long list of purported benefits. Problem is, most if not all of these benefits apply to all brands of sardines, not just these.<br /><br />One thing I'll say at the outset: If BPA free packaging is your most important purchase criterion read no further and buy these now. The packaging is indeed BPA free.<br /><br />But what about the whole concept of "wild" sardines? I'm not aware that the sardine has been domesticated, and the lowly pilchards that swarm the seas in massive schools sometimes visible from outer space are not amenable to aquaculture.<br /><br />On the other hand, qualifying these sardines as wild, notwithstanding the fact that all sardines are wild, does confer a seemingly significant though clearly misplaced credibility. No doubt this will boost sales to a gullible buying public.<br /><br />Read the packaging for these sardines and you can't help but feel you're saving Mother Earth as you chomp on your sandwich. But digging down beneath the surface, there's not so much to be excited about.<br /><br />For instance there's the matter of what happens to these fish after they're "sustainably caught along the California coast". The small print provides a clue in that these bad boys are "processed in Viet Nam". So what's really going on is that our diminutive sardines take on a heavy carbon footprint, travelling as they do from the west coast to the far east and back again, presumably to harvest the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of buy-local chic and low labor costs. Nonetheless, we read that, "These sardines are considered a `Best Choice for Sustainability' by a consensus of environmental organizations".<br /><br />There are other issues as well.<br /><br />The health benefits of chowing down on this product are highly touted. For instance, "Ounce for ounce, Wild Planet sardines provide 3 times more calcium and phosphorus than milk...". OK, fair enough. But is this, as implied, unique to the Wild Planet variety only, or is it once again a characteristic of all sardines? Unfortunately, it's the latter.<br /><br />We also learn that these "delicious meaty portions" are "cleaned and scaled". Buyer beware: this is quite different from "skinless and boneless". "Cleaned" in this context must mean something other that what is commonly expected by the use of this word in conjunction with fish. Be prepared to either eat the vertebral column and various entrails, or to remove (clean) them yourself.<br /><br />How do they taste?<br /><br />Not bad, if you're into schmaltz herring. These babies are smoked and have a characteristic smoky, salty taste.<br /><br />But don't worry. It's not just any smoke, but "aqueous natural smoke" that they're treated with...

review/summary: Great Tasting But Disappointed They're Packed in Vietnam
review/text: I recently found Wild Planet and purchased both the Wild Sardines and their Tuna.  The taste is amazing in both the sardines and tuna.  It simply can't be beaten and, they use BPA free cans which is very rare in this country.  Thanks to another review on Amazon, I discovered that many of the canned goods I was buying for my family that were organic, were also packed in cans coated in a lining that includes BPA.  I did some research and discovered Wild Planet.  Their tuna and sardines are more expensive but it's worth it because all of their products are sustainably caught, and packaged responsibly.  They're good for our planet and great for my family.  The only reason I'm not rating them 5 stars is because the sardines are processed in Vietnam and not the US.  The tuna is processed here. The sardines are not, and while I'm sure the canneries used are monitored by Wild Planet, I would much rather serve my family something that was packaged in this country giving fellow Americans much needed jobs.  I also think that with the price of the sardines, they should be packaged here.<br /><br />Anyway, if taste is your only concern, buy these sardines.  They're the best I've tasted.  If you care where your food is processed, these might not be for you--altho, no sardines are processed in this country anymore so I guess we're just out of luck. For some reason, we Americans don't seem to care that we now make very little in our own country.  Go figure.

review/summary: Great flavor!
review/text: Very good fruit slices.  The flavor is tart-not too sweet and has a dusting of sugar.  Very good when left out to get a little more solid-not so gel like!

review/summary: Fun for kids!
review/text: I bought several of these as a birthday party goody bag filler. This is basically ice cream flavored pop rocks but all of the kids loved them and is a very reasonable price.

review/text: we pace the floor when stewed chicken is not available.  This is baby dogs favorite food mixed with chef michaels dry chicken kibble.  He loves this to distraction.  Never seems to get tired of it.

review/summary: Best decaf I've tried so far
review/text: Based on the reviews here, the price, and the fair trade aspect; I decided to give this coffee a try. I was very pleased with both the aroma and flavor: rich, complex, reminding me a bit of mocha though no actual chocolate flavor. Highly recommended for anyone who likes a rich cup of coffee without the caffeine.
