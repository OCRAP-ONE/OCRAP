review/summary: our family favorite bar --
review/text: It's so nice to finally have a crunchy granola bar with a worthwhile fiber and protein count -- none of those nasty plasticine partially-hydrogenated-poisons, and CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? -- Zero none not-one-drop of high-fructose-make-you-fat-like-a-pig-for-slaughter corn syrup!<br /><br />Bravo!<br /><br />They have the same flake-apart crunch as those old Hidden Valley Granola Bars from the 80's  (really good, but really just another empty calorie stash.)<br /><br />And what sets them head and shoulders above the rest -- when it says "pumpkin spice flax" in the name -- it's telling the truth.  You can actually taste the pepitas, and the spice mix really does bring up pumpkin pie memories.  And the flax is there to boost the stats on Omega X fatty acids.<br /><br />A well made, well thought out bit of pocketable food.

review/text: I absolutely LOVE  the Pumpkin Spice bars!  Not only are they made with natural ingredients and are amazingly good for you, they taste great!  Especially if you like your Granola bars nice and hard.  I didn't think these would taste so well, but the pumpkin and spice flavor is wonderful!<br /><br />Go Kashi!

review/summary: Don't kid yourself.  It's a candy bar.
review/text: These bars do taste great, but that's because they have a whole lot of sugar in them.  Look at the label.  The second listed (and thus second most predominant) ingredient is "evaporated cane juice crystals," which is just a euphemism for sugar.<br /><br />I thought I was buying a healthy snack bar.  Well, it maybe better than a Snickers Bar.... but not much.<br /><br />If you want a great tasting candy bar, buy it.  But if you want something healthy, purchase another product.

review/summary: Yowsa! Schedule a dentist's visit before "biting" into one of these!
review/text: First of all, let me say the flavor is great. A bit of spice, nothing overwhelming, and a hint of pumpking, nothing overwhelming. A fair number of pumpkin seeds, and a really nice blend of grains.<br /><br />On the other hand, you might want to be sure your dentist will be able to see you on an emergency basis each time you open a pack of these. Yowsa! They are not crunchy, unless by crunchy you mean "practically impossible to break apart and even harder to actually chew." I literally have to break these apart using both hands because I don't want to risk shattering my teeth. Seriously. Maybe I got a bad batch, but geez.  I won't buy these again. I will instead buy the soft ones.

review/summary: Almost as hard as a rock
review/text: These bars are so crunchy, I have to break them into pieces before biting into them.<br />The pumpkin spice has enough sweetness to satisfy me and contains a good amount of protein and fiber, much more than the average granola bar sold at the supermarket. So far the only other snack bar that surpasses Kashi would be South Beach Living Cereal Bars with 10 grams of protein compared to the 6 grams in Kashi. The average protein being simply 2 grams. I have to add that although Kashi uses some of the most natural ingredients, their products don't contain many vitamins, if at all.<br />So I'm probably going to stick with South Beach cereal bars. Plenty of vitamins, and yes it does have corn syrup and artificial flavors, but it tastes really good and won't chip a tooth. The Cinnamon Raisin flavor is better than the chocolate, It's like eating a cinnamon raisin bun, but much healthier. =)

review/summary: Pretty good marshmallow fluff replacement
review/text: I am a huge lover of marshmallow fluff; however, when I became a vegan I needed to find a replacement for it, as it contains eggs. I was very happy and excited to find that a vegan and gluten-free version was available.<br /><br />The taste is almost as good, while the texture and thickness are slightly different. It seems like I require more of the Ricemellow Creme to achieve the same taste in, say, a cup of hot chocolate. The price is also a bit outrageous comparatively speaking.<br /><br />Overall, would recommend it; however, I have not made a repeat purchase as of yet. Perhaps once the price comes down I will.

review/summary: Incredibly Delicious!!!
review/text: If you love Marshmallow creme, but are allergic to sugar or just want to have a healthier substitute, THIS IS IT!!!<br />I couldn't believe it when I saw it in the health food store. I decided to take my chances and try it and boy am I glad I did. NO REGRETS! (sometimes you buy something that is supposed to be healthy and you wish you hadn't spent the money cause it just doesn't compare to the real thing)<br /><br />As soon as I tried it, I knew I was going to be buying this for life. I made a fluffernutter sandwich and honestly, you would never know it wasn't the real thing! The color is a slight off-white in the container, but the TASTE is soooo delicious, who cares about the color! Besides, when you put it on the peanut butter, it automatically looks whiter. (I only mention this because I noticed how much whiter it got when I made the sandwich)<br /><br />Seriously, this is a hidden gem in the health world! I can't wait to try it out in some recipes.<br />I did put it on some popcorn the other day and it was sooooo yummy! I had bought some microwave popcorn that I just didn't like and was not planning on ever finishing the other 5 packages.......it was that disappointing. Well, then I remembered the ricemellow creme and thought hmmmmm, popcorn balls maybe. I did not form them into balls, but it was perfectly delicious on the popcorn!<br /><br />I ran out of bread and am wanting a ricemellow peanut butter sandwich like you wouldn't believe. I'll never go back to the sugar brand as long as this is available. Especially since sugar is my enemy. I just can't have it.<br />Ricemellow creme is truly something to try if you love marshmallow creme. Enjoy! I promise you won't regret it!

review/summary: My dream come true!!
review/text: I LOVE marshmallows... almost as much as I love marshmallow creme. So after becoming a vegetarian - I was afraid I'd never find a decent substitute. But I found one, and here it is! I absolutely love Suzanne's Ricemallow Creme. The flavor and texture are wonderful. The color is the only thing that is quite unlike the "real thing". The standard jet puffed marshmallow creme is a stark white. But when I first opened this product, it was an off white color. Not too dark - I used it to drizzle over s'more cupcakes and it looked great. But a few months later, I opened it to put into hot chocolate and it was a darker, more yellow color. But the flavor and texture were still great - So I really don't mind. I would just use a fresh jar for things like cupcakes.<br />I will buy this ptroduct forever.

review/summary: Wonderful (if you're not allergic to soy)!
review/text: My son can't have artifical colors so this is a perfect replacement for marshmallow fluff.  He has this in peanutbutter sandwiches daily.  I would love to make rice crispy treats, but I think I would probably need an entire container for a batch.  This stuff is so hard to find!!!  They haven't had it on Amazon for ages.  Whole Foods carries it, but they are about 2 hours away.  I'm still looking for a regular supplier...<br /><br />UPDATE 11/1/11:<br />My son suddenly became very allergic to soy while eating his favorite ricemellow and peanutbutter sandwich.  He's been eating this same sandwich almost every day for 9 + months.  Just out of nowhere he starting getting an itchy throat after eating this sandwich.  We didn't think too much about it until the next time it turned to hives all over his face and neck. I immediately set him up for an apt. with an allergist fully expecting this would be a peanut allergy.  On a whim, I had them test both soy and peanuts because the peanut butter had soy oil.  I never thought to look at the ingredients of the ricemellow.  Yikes!  The #2 ingredient is soy protein.  Who would have guessed?  My 8 yo son is now allergic to soy, peas, peanuts (legume family) and probably beans.  How an allergy comes on like this I have know idea.<br /><br />Of course this happened just after I ordered 6 containers from Vitacost!!!<br /><br />Ricemellow Creme Ingredients: Brown Rice Syrup, Soy Protein, Natural Gums & Natural Flavors

review/summary: BPA? Yes and no...
review/text: I contacted Muir Glen directly and asked whether or not their cans contained BPA. You can see their response below:<br /><br />"Thank you for contacting Muir Glen about bisphenol-A or BPA.<br /><br />Bisphenol-A is a component of protective coatings in metal food packaging, and provides an important food safety and quality function in canned foods. Scientific and governmental bodies worldwide have examined the science many times and have concluded that the weight of evidence supports the safety of BPA, including recent comprehensive assessments in Japan and in the European Union.<br /><br />In January 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced another review of BPA. This review in expected to take 18-24 months, and Health Canada and the World Health Organization (WHO) will participate.<br /><br />Most metal cans in the food industry utilize BPA in the can lining or can lid. Some of our products do, and many competitors' products do as well.<br /><br />Muir Glen continues to believe BPA is safe. However, we know that some of our consumers have wanted us to pursue alternatives. We have been working with our can suppliers and can manufacturers to develop and test alternative linings that do not use BPA for some time.<br /><br />One alternative has proven safe and viable in our processing of tomatoes - and Muir Glen is in the midst of transitioning to cans with liners that do not use BPA. It is an approved non-epoxy alternative. Can coatings used by Muir Glen also comply fully with all applicable U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements for safe use in food contact applications.<br /><br />Your views are important to us. Again, thank you for contacting Muir Glen, and thank you for your support of our products.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Consumer Services"

review/summary: too many dents, short shelf life
review/text: I don't have much freezer space, I'm getting older, and I hate having to carry heavy cans up all those steps to my home.  (Unfortunately, lots of steps inside, too.)  I thought I'd stock up a little since I'd used  most of what I had this on hand this past winter, and take advantage of free shipping as well as lower prices for "subscribe and save."  Guess I'll cancel.  There were way too many cans that were badly dented.  I'm not talking about little dents in the side, either.  When the dent is right where the seam for the top or bottom meets the side, I worry about the integrity of the seal.  I also noticed that the "best if used by" date was Feb. 2013, and I bought these in late April 2012.  Some canned Libby's organic vegetables (2 kinds) which I bought at the same time had a "best if used by date" of Dec. 2014, so I wasn't happy about the shorter Muir Glen shelf life.

review/summary: Price Nearly Doubled Since November 2011
review/text: These are great canned tomatoes, but I don't understand how they were 14.40 in November and now theyre 22.00 ?<br /><br />Also, the BPA situation is serious. But the reason it's still being used is because BPA is essentially an unregulated chemical.  See [...]<br /><br />From page 4 -<br />"None of the regulatory agencies, all of which are heavily dominated by chemical industry interests"...they just didn't know what to do with this (a hill of new research)  "And the choice is, they've got 100,000 chemicals in commerce. They actually have regulatory authority over a small number of them, because in the 1970s with the Toxic Substance Control Act, they grandfathered in 62,000 chemicals, including BPA, that are totally outside the regulatory system. So there's no regulation of BPA"<br /><br />But in January, 2010, the FDA did something remarkable -- it reversed its position that BPA is safe, and said we agree with our science advisory agency that there is reason for concern for prostate cancer, for early puberty, for a variety of things. This was a huge breakthrough. Now we actually have a government agency that has accepted that this is a chemical to be avoided. But they said, "We're sorry, but we do not have the authority to do that. We don't even have the authority to go to the chemical industry and say, `What's this in?' We can't even find that out." It's a grandfathered chemical."<br /><br />"What the FDA said is, "We are working with Congress to try to get laws changed." But changing the rules that we operate by, if we had a compliant industry, would take five to 10 years. And this is one extremely non-compliant industry. It's almost a $10 billion-a-year product. You know, people don't give up that kind of money."<br />---<br />One problem other than early puberty in females (because it mimics estrogens) is the feminization of boys and males (including affecting their development in-vitro from the mother's consumption of BPA as well as soy proteins)  that we don't often read about. This could produce a national security problem, if we are developing feminine boys (watch the feminists scream at me :))<br /><br />Either way, I figured people who purchase organic products would appreciate being made aware of this, if they weren't already :)

review/summary: Update - May be BPA free now!
review/text: UPDATE - I heard that Muir Glen had started transitioning their canned tomato products to BPA free cans but when contacting Muir Glen (General Mills), I kept getting a canned (no pun intended) response that they believe BPA is safe...blah blah blah. But today, I finally got the answers I was looking for including how to tell which cans at the grocery store are BPA free. Muir Glen started transitioning to BPA free cans (for their tomato products only) in September 2010. Their shelf life is 2 1/2 years; therefore, an expiration date after March 2013 should be a BPA free can liner. You can confirm it is BPA free when you open the can because the old BPA liner was white, but the new BPA free liner is a copper color. I did ask General Mills to please label their products BPA free to help us consumers when shopping. I hope that eventually all canned goods will be BPA free. Let me know what you find when shopping.<br /><br />I am so excited to have a BPA free Organic tomato product, yay! Thanks Muir Glen!<br /><br />Old review - I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! It makes me sick that I fed them with BPA laden baby bottles before I knew better. We already have enough cancer in our family. I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder.<br /><br />I wrote to Muir Glen (now owned by General Mills) to see if they have any plans to remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. I would be happy to pay a bit more for jarred tomato products if they can't come up with BPA free cans. Or how about tomatoes in cartons or frozen?<br /><br />Please write to the companies that you buy canned tomatoes from and ask for BPA free products. Let me know if anyone finds BPA free tomato products, such as tomato paste, diced tomatoes, whole tomatoes...by responding to this comment--I will get an email.<br /><br />I have young children and I will not feed them anymore BPA!!!

review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Urban Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

review/summary: Rich-Tasting Full-bodied
review/text: My preferred method is a press-pot (AKA French press) so I can taste every nuance of the coffee. This is a big-bodied brew. You will not be disappointed. I recommend consuming this ASAP. Camano Island Coffee Roasters corrected any previous packaging problems.

review/summary: No safety seals on packaging!
review/text: This was my first experience with this brand of coffee. I was stunned when I opened the package this morning. There is nothing to prevent product tampering. The bag is open at the top and fastened with one of those long wire closures that fastens across the opening of the bag. That's it. I didn't have to cut the bag open with a scissors as you do with some brands. There was no cellophane tape holding the flap down as you see in some brands. Since safety seals became standard on food and health and beauty products after the Tylenol scare, I have never received a food item from any manufacturer that provided no form of sealant to ensure that the product can't be tampered with after packaging. I would not recommend buying coffee from Camano Island for this reason. I will not be buying it again, that's for sure.

review/summary: Best Caramel in the UNIVERSE
review/text: If you like Caramels, this is the only PERFECT Caramel IN THE WORLD. Nothing else comes close to comparing. The most expensive and worth every penny.<br />Anything else is a PRACTICAL JOKE - This is Caramel the way it should be. the balance between sweet and salty - hard and soft - is just... simply... PERFECT. It really does not get any better than that - Tasted the original Caramel from Turin, Italy - not even close to the French's Caramel. If you want the best - THIS IS IT !

review/summary: What a hassle-saver!
review/text: My family loves bourbon chicken sold at shopping mall food courts, but it's really difficult to reproduce the same flavor at home. I searched the internet for the recipes, and most of them were not even close. So when I found this product I thought I would just give it a try. Well, I'm glad I did! Just dip the sauce on the grilled meat (not limited to chicken) and you're good to go. The time and hassle saved can be well spent with my family; how great can it be?<br /><br />This company's website, [...], provides some variations of the bourbon chicken recipe. If you love cooking as much as I do, do check them out!

review/summary: Sweet, salty, and savory!
review/text: My kids always want bourbon chicken when we go to food courts, so I decided to do some research on recipes and found this item (along with bourbon chicken marinade in the same line). This sauce didn't disappoint us; it tastes just like what we had at food courts.<br /><br />For best flavor I do have an advice: Use the marinade sauce for a strong smokey flavor and save time, or charcoal grill your chicken AND throw in hickory chips. I love grilling and don't mind all the hassle, and the chicken turns out even better than the food court version.

review/summary: A Must-have for Tailgate Parties
review/text: Grilling is part of my family tailgate party ritual, and we are constantly looking for new flavors to try, especially with the new college football season coming. I came across this sauce on Amazon and thought I could give it a try. I am glad I did! This sauce tastes great not only on chicken, but also on sausages, pork, and even steak! Just as the product names suggests, it's fairly simple to use: Just dip your grilled, baked, or smoked meat into the sticky sauce, or glaze it on the meat, and you are good to go. All my family and neighbors love the unique flavor. I can't wait to invite my friends over for a treat!

review/text: I first found this product in the checkout lines at Austrian groceries. When I returned back to the US, I ordered this from Amazon to share with co-workers.  They are espresso-filled chocolates and are quite good.  I had to warn co-workers to put the entire thing in their mouth, because the espresso is liquid and will drip out if you bite.  My colleagues snapped them up quickly and we were energized for the rest of the day!  I had to hide them from my 6 year old because she liked them, too, and would climb anywhere to find them.  She already has enough energy.

review/summary: DELISH! Perfect for that chocolate-coffee lover in you
review/text: My husband and I fell in love with Pocket Coffee candies while we lived in Italy back in '09. We brought back a pack when we came back to the states, and hoarded them like precious, precious gold. Unfortunately, after a while (um, ok, a year), the coffee crystalized / vaporized, and the chocolate became super stale. It was so sad when we realized instead of making the package last forever, all we were left with was really stale and questionable candies.<br /><br />Anyway, point being, they should really just be enjoyed right away : ) (and now that you can order on Amazon, there's no reason not to enjoy them in a timely manner!)

review/summary: DANGEROUS CAN CAUSE DEATH!
review/text: PLEASE NOTE, THAT IN ORDER FOR MY POST TO GO ONTO THIS SITE  I HAD TO HIGHLIGHT ONE STAR!IT DESERVES NONE!SADLY,I FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY THAT THESE MOO BULLY STICKS ARE NOT 100% DIGESTIBLE! MY DOG ALMOST DIED AFTER A PIECE DID NOT DISSOLVE IN HER STOMACH.My 3 dogs loved these Moo Bully sticks. I was giving these to my dogs.WOW DID THEY LOVE THEM. I HAD RESEARCHED THEM and WHAT I READ SOUNDED GREAT! BUT THESE WERE ANYTHING BUT SAFE. I did monitor the dogs when chewing them and I would take away them away once they were chewed down to a small piece. I felt they could cause a chocking factor. But this was not the problem I encountered. because I felt it might causes a chocking danger.I always had plenty of water close by. One day I noticed my dog,Lily, was having very loose stools and that were jelly like in consistency.This same day she stopped eating and began vomiting.I immediately rushed her to my veterinarian.Upon his physical exam he noted that her abdomen was hard and distended.He wanted me to leave her with him so he could do a x-ray. He did and found that she had a blockage in her stomach!He then started a series of Barium x-rays to watch the blockage to see if it was going to pass. Over a 4 hour period of watching and repeating these barium x-rays it not only showed that the blockage was not passing, but the "item" causing the blockage was swelling in size, absorbing the stomach fluids.I was told he had to do emergency surgery to get this blockage out of her ASAP. What he found in her stomach was most definitely a piece of the Moo Bully stick! It had not digested as claimed by the manufacture if swallowed.My veterinarian told me if he had not brought Lily in as promptly as I did,to remove this blockage, she most definitely would have died!He told me that this was not 100% digestible as the manufacture had claimed it to be . If it had been, it would have dissolved in her stomach! lily had major abdominal exploratory surgery  that lasted over 3hours, to remove this piece the piece of Moo Bully stick !She was hospitalized afterwards for 4 nights and 5 days. She almost did not make. Lily refused eat for 5 days. She therefore lost a lot of weight,became very frail and lethargic. Thank god, my veterinarian was fabulous.He was so concerned for Lily, that he actually stayed by her side at night,every night making sure he did everything he could to pull her through this.Once home she was weak and could barely walk. I tried to get her to eat and she refused. I was offering her cooked chicken liver and even this did not even entice her to eat. Finally, the next day, she did begin to nibble on some food. It was a very slow healing process and took Lily over a month until she was herself again.The thought of losing Lily tore me apart. Watching the pain and suffering she went though cannot be put into words.I felt so helpless. It was nothing but a pure hell that she and I went though for weeks on end.I was also feeling so guilty because I gave her the MOO Bully stick.You see, I only feed my dogs the very best, high quality organic dog foods. I never ever ever would give my dogs anything that was not the best and the safest. I never gave my dogs raw hide chewies or greenies( Any dog owner that cares about the welfare of their a dog knows how dangerous and deadly these products are) I started giving my dogs the Moo bully sticks because everything I had read and researched lead me to believe not only were they safe,  100%  DIGESTIBLE, but that they came from Brazil cattle that only grazed on non chemically treated grass, were not feed any hormones and drank from fresh natural spring water.There was nothing harmful in this product. So I stared giving my dogs these MOO bully sticks.I am a very dedicated,caring, responsible animal lover and owner. I wrote letters to the companies I purchased the Moo Bully sticks form as well as the manufacturer. Only one retailer responded to my letter by referring me to the manufacturer.The manufacturer of these Moo Bully Sticks, " Free Range Dog Products " totally ignored both of my certified letters. So many owners have no clue that their dogs may have become sick or died due to a piece of a Bully stick that did not digest. What if their vet missed the symptoms? What if they never took their dog to a vet after becoming ill and the dog died? What if they never discovered what killed their dog? Not everyone can afford to pay for surgery on their dogs, x-rays,lab work,medicines,and a hospital stay. My vet bill was almost $5,000.00 My vet even discounted most of what he did, as well not charge me for everything.In fact, he  he felt so bad, that he did not charge me for staying by her side for all through the night, on those  4 nights. What if a dog died or got very ill when ingesting a piece of these Bully sticks and never came forth to inform the public ? Maybe mine is the very first case? But all it should take is one, to satisfy anyone not to ever buy this product and give it their beloved dogs. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, DO NOT EVER GIVE YOUR DOGS ANY TYPE OF A BULLY STICK PRODUCT!PASS THIS INFO ALONG TO ANYONE THAT YOU KNOW HAS A DOG. YOU MIGHT JUST SAVE A DOGS LIFE.

The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.  1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste.  Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.<br /><br />I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation.

review/summary: Bad batch of Stevia
review/text: Stevia is kind of funny. Brands and batches vary. Sometimes you get a batch that isn't very sweet or has more of an aftertaste (bitterness). Usually, I only have to use 1/16 of a tsp of NOW Stevia to sweeten my morning coffee. The batch I received this time is weak, so I have to use twice as much. (Thank goodness it isn't bitter though.) So it goes with using a natural sweetener. The leaves from which this batch of stevia was extracted must not have had a very high concentration of rebaudiana. I strongly believe that the manufacturer should test out each batch made for quality before packaging it so customers aren't disappointed. Oh, well, better luck next time. I'll still use stevia as a sweetener (I use it in everything I need sweetened). I'm just going to wait a while before buying more NOW stevia until I'm fairly certain all of this batch has been sold.

review/summary: SUPER NATURAL SUGER SUBSTITUTE + TERRIFIC BRAND
review/text: EXCELLENT SUGAR SUBSTITUTE HAS HEALTH BENEFITS + NO WARNINGS,<br /><br />This "NOW Stevia powder" is good stuff and this among the most economical and user-friendly ways to buy Stevia.<br /><br />WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT:<br /><br />Sweeter than sugar, that's what Stevia is, but that's not all.<br /><br />Stevia has been shown to lower blood sugar levels in research involving healthy adults by increasing the secretion of insulin making Stevia useful for diabetics.<br /><br />It also improves digestion and gastrointestinal function, and is useful for upset stomachs and to reduce gas and stomach acidity. Several recent studies have shown that it may improve the heart's muscle tone and promote the body's water loss. These properties are thought to contribute to lower blood pressure.<br /><br />Stevia also has antiviral, antimicrobial and antibacterial characteristics. It's used for relieving bleeding gums, sore throats and cold sores in South America and Japan. Stevia has been shown to inhibit plaque formation and bacterial growth causing gum disease and tooth decay, and will not cause cavities. It may even reduce cravings for sweets which coupled with its lack of calories may be helpful in weight loss.<br /><br />ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS EVEN MORE:<br /><br />There is anecdotal evidence that Stevia is good for skin problems like acne, cold sores, dermatitis and eczema, and may speed up the healing of cuts and scratches. There have even been reports that Stevia may be useful as a contraceptive, but that has not yet been substantiated by research.<br /><br />FDA APPROVAL TO BE SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT -- NOT A SWEETENER<br /><br />Most of all, Stevia, unlike the artificial sweeteners we put in everything from soda to psyllium does not come with any health warnings from the FDA, and it will probably do you no harm. However, Stevia has not been approved to be sold as a sweetener even though it is a NATURAL SWEETENER LIKE SUGAR. Nevertheless, Stevia has been approved [since 1994] to be sold as a dietary supplement in the United States.<br /><br />AFTER ALL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED THIS IS FOOD - USE IT BY EATING IT!<br /><br />Stevia can be substituted for sugar. It is a bit different tasting if one is use to sugar. I use it on many things where I can eliminate large amounts of honey and/or sugar such as;<br /><br />1]- Herbal Tea, instead of sugar or honey.<br /><br />2]- In multi-grain hot cereal, when you need to sweeten it, Stevia saves me a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of sugar per large bowl. In this case I just add about a teaspoon of honey and 1/8 teaspoon of stevia for the same effect. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar so use about 1/10th as much in place of sugar.<br /><br />3]- Iced Tea.<br /><br />4]- Pancakes, waffles and French Toast as a replacement for some maple syrup.<br /><br />MEDICINALLY SPEAKING:<br /><br />A standardized extract of 57 mg. containing 85% "steviocides" in a beverage, is what Doctor James A. Duke, suggests in his famous, "The Green Pharmacy Herbal Handbook".<br /><br />ABOUT FORMS AND BRANDS:<br /><br />I prefer Stevia in powder over the packets, as I can better measure, and use what I need for each individual use. Purchase Stevia in whatever form you are most comfortable using.<br /><br />This "NOW" brand Stevia powder is an excellent product and a terrific value. "Planetary Formulas Stevia Powder 3.5 oz." is also excellent and it comes in a liquid as well. "Swanson" and "Nature's Way" are both excellent too, and have Stevia in powder, liquid and packets for convenient use. Any of the above choices are excellent, and I have used them all at one time or another, over the past 3-4 years on a daily basis.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

review/summary: Weak...
review/text: I've been buying KAL stevia for awhile now with good results but now I decided to go cheap and buy 1 lb of this stuff thinking it would be pretty much the same. Nope... It's way weaker than KAL and takes 3-4x as much so even though I saved 50 percent I'll be wasting more money using more of the product. Oh well. I'll use it up and buy KAL again.

review/summary: my preferred sweetener
review/text: I have been a diabetic for almost forty years.  I have tried many sweeteners over the years, some of which caused me some severe reactions.  Years ago, I decided I preferred stevia.  Lately I did another comparison between the different stevia brands.  Better Stevia Organic in the packets is the one I decided to go with.  I do not bake with sweeteners and eat very little baked goods since I am selective on how I expend my carb allowance.  Mostly I just use the stevia in beverages. The organic stevia packets are lined with an inner seal, I suppose to keep it fresh and to keep it from getting hard. However when you hold the packet over a cup of hot beverage the stevia draws moisture and clings to the liner making it difficult to pour out. I simply add the stevia to my cup before I pour in the liquid.  It also does not dissolve quickly in iced beverages.  It takes a minute or two for it to completely dissolve. I like this Stevia Organic enough to deal with these issues.  It does not have additional ingredients.  It is just organic stevia and I like it that way.

review/summary: Great price, super sweet goodness
review/text: I love NOW's stevia extract, I put it in everything - tea, cereal, curries, stir fries, baking.  There are no sugar carbs at all and it is 200 time sweeter than sugar so 1 lb goes a long way.  The savings with a pound it amazing (compared to $10 for a very small container) and it seems to stay good for a long time, it takes me sometimes a year to finish it.  Some people find that stevia leaves an aftertaste that do not care for so you may want to try a smaller bottle first if you have never tried it.  Every brand supposedly is a little different so if you don't have good luck with one try another.

review/text: The very 1st thing I noticed about this product was how nasty it tasted! I've tried stevia by numerous manufacturers (PLUS, I read the excellent reviews!)  and this is hands-down the worst!<br /><br />When I finally read the actual ingredients (I had assumed it was stevia) and discovered that the very 1st ingredient wasn't stevia..but RICE MALTODENTRIN, I was shocked AND angry!  I have a liver disorder and cannot pump crap like maltodextrin into my liver!  Hence, the use of stevia, an all natural product.  BEWARE IF YOU HAVE DIABETES and think this is a safe sugar substitute.  It's NOT!  Below is a quote from a website (the link follows)...and there are plenty of others with warnings for maltodextrin for those who are looking for an safe sugar substitute.<br /><br />PLUS... I don't care what anyone says.  If you think this is the best stevia product ever (and many actually do!) then you haven't tried the right stevia manufacturer.  NOW isn't one of them.<br />I ordered this shoe in the correct size but they were huge.  i am returning them & hoping that the smaller size will work.  they match the dress perfect & are adorable.<br />..."It's the combination that may cause spikes in insulin because maltodextrin is a carbohydrate with a high glycemic index, similar to table sugar and should be used in moderation if you have diabetes or hypoglycemia. You must consider the carbohydrate content of products sweetened with added maltodextrin to maintain healthy blood sugar levels."<br /><br />Read more:[...]

review/summary: Do Not Like the Taste Compared to Truvia
review/text: I tried this product and I have to say that I just cannot tolerate the taste.  At least for me, it tastes awful. I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I have been using Truvia and Truvia tastes much more like sugar than this product.  I don't know what this tastes like.  It is unlike anything I've ever tasted - and it sure doesn't taste like sugar to me. I had to pour out a fresh pitcher of green tea because it tasted so bad.  I made another pitcher of tea with Truvia and it was much better tasting. I usually mix some real sugar with Stevia.  But this last pitcher of tea was sweetened only by Truvia (Stevia) and it was pretty good tasting. It certainly isn't an identical taste to sugar, but close enough after you adjust to the taste.  When I use Truvia with coffee and cream, I can't tell the difference with real sugar.  And that is probably because the French Vanilla cream overwhelms the overall taste.<br /><br />I know my review is counter to the other reviews, but it is just my experience and opinion.  Everybody has a different sense of taste. All food has a rather intense taste to me. About 25% of the population is a super taster. We have many more taste buds on our tongue. That describes me. So you may have a different experience than I did.

However, it is outstanding for sweetening tea, coffee and smoothies.<br /><br />Many have claimed that stevia is 200 times as sweet as white sugar. I don't agree. To my taste it is no more than 16 times as sweet.<br /><br />Be careful about using too much because it slips from sweet to bitter to the taste when that happens.

review/text: I've been on the Atkins/Low-Carb diet for several years so I avoid sugar like the plague. Also to be avoided are carbonated diet-drinks. Which leaves me little choice other than water. So, I make a half-gallon of Kool-Aid with a teaspoon of Stevia EXTRACT and a teaspoon of liquid saccharin. Some complain this is too sweet for their tastes. But, do the math, a pound of sugar is LOT more expensive and takes at least a full cup per half gallon.<br /><br />In the past, I've had to purchase Stevia at the health food stores for $12-$15 an OUNCE. Here I bought a POUND (16 ounces) for less that the cost of four ounces from the health food stores. Fantastic price!<br /><br />Be careful what you wish for, a POUND of Stevia is a LOT of Stevia (At least a year's worth...;-}  )<br /><br />In a year, I'll buy another jug of it.

review/summary: Teeny tiny spoon!
review/text: I've been trying a number of different kinds of stevia, both liquid and powder. This one is my favorite. It has a very neutral taste and one tiny spoon of it is perfect in a big glass of oolong hibiscus iced tea. A heaping tiny spoon of it is perfect in a chocolate/banana/soy milk smoothie. I originally got it to put in something called "mega muffins" but managed to use up an entire 1 oz container of it without even making the muffins and have had to order more. I really like that it's organic. I've been trying different sweeteners in my hibiscus oolong iced tea, and this is not only better than any other stevia product I've found, but works better than any other sweetener as well. Even regular granulated sugar. It dissolves pretty much instantly. I'm thinking about ordering the 1 lb size (although that would probably last me about two years) I just wonder if that size comes with the teeny tiny spoon!

review/summary: Now brand stevia is 1/5 as sweet as Kal brand
review/text: I purchased one pound of Now brand stevia extract for $63.61. The overly large container is labeled "Better Stevia" "Certified Organic". Ingredient:Organic Stevia Extract Powder. I found I needed to use at least five times more stevia powder to get a similar sweetness as the Kal brand. I returned it for a refund.<br />Avoid this. Buy:[[ASIN:B000VRSR84 Pure Stevia Extract Powder - 3.5 oz - Powder]

review/text: My husband Kurt and I are very satisfied with Now Foods Stevia extract. We are very health conscious. Our products must be healthy, pure and natural. After searching, this is the only stevia we will buy. We recommend it to our family and anyone who wants to stay away from sugar.  Other products are full of chemicals that are worse than the sugar.  Now Foods Stevia extract powder is natural.  We only use about 1/8 of a teaspoon for a full 8oz cup of coffee. Even that may be too much. We buy it by the pound and it lasts a long time.  How can anyone not use this product to substitute sugar?! It is an excellent product. We give it at least five stars.<br />Honestly and sincerely,<br /><br /> Kurt & Linda.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGWIH0">Now Foods Stevia Extract - Powder 1 lbs</a>

review/summary: Better Than Sugar!
review/text: I have used Stevia for several years, but often have had trouble finding it. It was a real pleasure to find it on Amazon! Stevia is a natural sweetener made from the Stevia rebaundiana leaf. It is not an artificial sweetner made with chemicals. It has no unpleasant taste, though people who use artificial sweeteners may take a few days to get used to the lack of "chemical" sweeteners. Most people who use Stevia find that they can use less of it than other sweeteners as it's sweetness level is higher per packet. I recommend Stevia to anyone who wishes not to use sugar for any reason, but still likes things a bit sweet. By the way, Stevia has no calories.

review/text: I love stevia, I have experimented with the liquid, glycerin, the one oz powder size and this is by far the best for your money.  Just be careful adding it to something cold, you might want to mix it with warm-to-hot water first to get it in liquid form before adding it.  Also, I make approx 2 liters of tea at a time and only need to add one-half teaspoon stevia powder!  I am very thankful for this 16 oz size!

review/text: NOW stevia is the best I have used so far. I use it in many things...food and drink. The only way you will get an after taste with this product is if you use too much. It takes very little to sweeten food and drinks.

review/text: I have used the "Now"brand stevia for several years now but this improved version is just as good and it dissolves in liquids much easier than the old product. I use this as a sweetner in any drink that needs sugar.

review/summary: Great price for 1lb
review/text: I'm so glad I found this 1 pound of NOW stevia.  It is so much cheaper than the little bottles I had been buying for $8/oz.  The packaging is very wasteful--most of it is empty.  Eventually filling my little bottles will get hard unless I transfer the bulk into a smaller container.<br /><br />The taste is fine to me, better than Trader Joe's.  I've never had Kal's to know what I am missing.  I mainly use the stevia in tea and Kool Aid lemonade.  DH even liked my tea w/ stevia and he is a big sweet tea drinker.  I have started baking banana bread w/ stevia and have been very pleased.  I've never minded what little aftertaste of Stevia since my mom used Sweet N Low when I was growing up.<br /><br />FYI-The 1 pound package didn't come w/ the tiny single scoop, unless buried at bottom.  That would have been nice to have.

review/summary: The Only Place To Buy This....
review/text: Now does a beautiful job on this Stevia Extract. Wonderful flavor for cold drinks, and oatmeal, and nearly anything. And Amazon is the only place to buy it. The absolute best price and superb delivery. This is our second 1,000 count bag of Stevia via Amazon. By the way, the Stevia is actually packaged in white envelopes, not the blue envelopes shown in the advertisement. And the 1,000 envelopes come in a clear plastic bag with the best (open and close) nylon strap closure we have ever seen. You will get your moneys worth.

review/summary: Rapid Shipping, Great Product too.
review/text: I ordered this at 3pm one afternoon and it was at my home by 3pm the next day even though I only selected two day shipping. Rapid shipment=happy me!! Also, I like this Stevia as it is organic. With stevia, it is a bit of a different taste from your standard sweetener - but way more natural than anything else one can buy other than dates! Dates wouldn't sweetened my coffee very well either. We use this mostly in our morning coffee but for other uses as well (iced tea, etc).
