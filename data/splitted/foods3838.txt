review/text: Bamboo rice is very different. Unusual for a lot of people. The color makes it somewhat fun to play with. The jade color of can compliment many different kind of meals. We served it with large gulf pranws sauteed and then simmered very shortly with coconut milk and red Thai Curry.<br /><br />It's high content of chlorophyll causes the rice to be high on Vitamin B  and its flavor and aroma of jasmine green tea.

review/text: Since we have to be gluten free, it can be hard to find a good variety of grains we can eat. I was so happy to find this rice. I wish it was more readily available in my area, but even with shipping, the price per pound was under six dollars and the rice was fresh and a nice change from all the white and brown rice.<br /><br />Bamboo rice is actually a white rice that is infused with bamboo juice, which gives it a flavor similar to fresh green vegetables. It is moist and sticky, and goes well with chicken, pork, and vegetables.

review/summary: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/summary: Chemical taste
review/text: I bought this at a store and had high hopes because their vanilla biscotti flavor is very good. This caramel drizzle, however,  is not. It has a very bad chemical flavor and after taste and doesn't taste anything at all like caramel or coffee. I have only made one cup and would be willing to try another but I was very disappointed. I really enjoy good flavored coffee and understand that there may be some artificial flavors added, but this one was just bad. K cups are not cheap and it is always frustrating when one of them is not good. I would not purchase it again.

review/summary: Tastes like chemicals
review/text: First, I would like to say that I purchased this product from the STORE, not from this seller. Also that there was not a problem with the expiration date of the coffee.<br /><br />I am not a picky coffee drinker. I like all kinds, but I prefer stronger brews. I like flavored coffee as well, but only when it tastes like what it is suppose to. I don't think anyone wants to drink chemical flavored coffee.<br /><br /> When I bought this product I thought it was going to be great, I am a consumer of folgers and have tried different flavors of theirs, however this was the first k-cup brand I bought from them and was VERY disappointed.  The coffee is definitely flavored and does taste like caramel, but after each sip there is an after taste of some sort of chemical.  The after taste is so strong and disgusting that you can neither enjoy the flavor of the coffee nor the caramel. For the first time was unable to finish my cup of coffee. To drink the entire cup would have been the equivalent of torturing myself.<br /><br />I would not recommend anyone buy this product.

review/text: I visited Peru back in January, and once I got home I remembered I saved some of the Inca Corn snack from the market in Lima. I suddenly became sad because I only have 2-3 oz left. I searched every hispanic store in the area and could not find it. This product was out of stock for 2 months on Amazon. Once it came back in stock, I quickly ordered it and got it in 4 days! I was so excited to open the box and eat the snack! It was like I was back in Peru again. Some pieces are a little burnt but it still is so perfect! I will continue to order this product once I run out of my current stock. Thank you AMAZON! :)

review/text: Not to denigrate Sunshine Cheez-It Hot & Spicy baked snack crackers made with genuine McIlhenny Tabasco brand green pepper sauce, a truly great similar product, but THIS crisp is to the other as champagne is to beer (not that I actually drink the real stuff anymore, but let's just say I had some experience imbibing.) Not too much smoke flavor, a judicious edge of jalapeno, and interestingly-textured little squares of snacking joy which do not seem squirted out of an assembly-line pastry bag sans human chef sentiment. In my well-sampled opinion, the very best of the fine line of John Wm. Macy's exquisite savory nibbles.

review/summary: The Best Crackers I ever had
review/text: We just received these Jalapeno Cheese Crisps today. This is the first time I tried them but certainly not the last. The chips are not large and they are not uniformed size, the cheese is layered in between. They are most likely the best crackers/crisps I ever had. The jalapeno heat is nice and strong. I am somehow pretty sure that all the other flavors will be great and I'll try them all sooner or later.<br />We had a hard time putting the box down - that's the only problem I can see. I am sure they would be great with some cool sour cream dip but we did not get to that today, we did enough damage as is. They would be great for a party - entertaining, but I am not sure I want to share them....

There are 4 jars in this order, each with enough spice for 5 pounds of beef. I took one star off because, unless you're making 5 pounds of beef, you kind of have to estimate what fraction of the spice in the jar you have to use since the directions are for a whole jar.

review/summary: Wonderful, fresh vanilla beans, reasonably priced, from a great vendor
review/text: These beans come in a vacuum-sealed package to preserve freshness, and it works extremely well--all the beans that Beanilla sells are moist and plump with a wonderful texture and scent. There are multiple terrific flavors that you can get from Beanilla, but Tahitian is one that I knew well from buying it in extract form in the past. My Tahitian extract was extremely expensive, and I doled it out little by little and made it last for years. Then I discovered the fun and easy process of do-it-yourself vanilla extract, and a world of gourmet-cooking possibilities has opened up to me. My most frequent use of my vanilla extract is for homemade ice cream using my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000YRJT6">Vita-Mix</a>. It adds an amazing extra zing to the taste that is just delicious.<br /><br />I had never made my own vanilla extract before I ordered from Beanilla. Their customer service is superb, and one of their representatives told me by email how to make vanilla extract when I asked, and he also explained why one might want to make his/her own vanilla extract. When you make your own, you can be 100% sure exactly what has gone into the extract, which is not always the case with some types of vanilla extract that you buy pre-made. It is also cheaper and a lot of fun to make your own.<br /><br />Here is the technique for making vanilla extract spelled out in detail for anyone who has not tried it before, and I have uploaded photos demonstrating these steps:<br /><br />1. Assemble kitchen scissors, good quality vodka, a clean, dark-glass jar (I save all my empty vitamin jars), a funnel, a spoon, something to label the jar, such as a self-sticking label.<br />2. Remove the beans from the package. Cut each bean lengthwise in half. Then cut the beans horizontally into pieces small enough to fit in the jar and easily be covered by vodka.<br />3. Place the bean pieces in the jar.<br />4. Pour 1/2 cup of vodka into the jar per every 3 beans (for 10 beans, it would be a little over 1-1/2 cup). Then tamp down the beans so that all bean parts are covered by the vodka.<br />5. Put the lid on the jar and label the jar with this information: what kind of vanilla bean you used, the date, the amount of vodka you used in ounces (or whatever measure you prefer), and the number of beans you used, then place the jar in a cool, dry place like a kitchen cabinet (I put mine with my spices).<br />6. Every week or so shake the jar.<br />7. After 8 weeks, the vanilla extract is ready to use.

review/summary: Vanilla beans
review/text: I am becoming a home made icecream snob.  There is nothing like freshly made icecream using premium ingredients.  Vanilla beans are far superior to extract - there is no comparison.  To relese the flavor use a custard recipie for the icecream and add the beans and pods when you heat the custard mixture, cool overnight in the fidge then churn the next day - EXCELLENT.  The Tahitian beans are milder and a bit fruity compared to the more common Madagascar vanilla beans.  Will be sending another order to this seller shortly - excellent product, well packed, and delivered on time.

review/summary: Exotic, Floral-Flavored Vanilla Beans
review/text: Tahitian vanilla beans don't taste at all like "vanilla" to me.  They impart an exotic floral flavor, that makes me think of flowers growing in a lush Tahitian rain forest.  Probably the unusual flavor shouldn't have surprised me, because Tahitian beans are not only grown in a different climate from the usual "Bourbon" vanilla beans (grown in Madagascar or Mexico), but they also come from a plant that is a hybrid of the Bourbon vanilla plant and another totally different strain of vanilla plant.<br /><br />However, my "Tahitian Vanilla" ice cream is tasty, and it's a fun variation on regular vanilla ice cream!  These high-quality Tahitian beans are plump and moist, and contain lots of tiny vanilla seeds.  The seeds are slightly harder to remove from the pods than the seeds of Bourbon vanilla beans.  Also, the Tahitian beans are slightly shorter and flatter than Bourbon vanilla beans. In recipes, one Tahitian vanilla bean is the equivalent of one Bourbon vanilla bean, but your recipe will not taste the same. For beans that have regular vanilla flavor, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002PHEZC">Premium Bourbon-Madagascar Vanilla Beans</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CPYVGM">Award Winning Mexican Vanilla Beans</a>.  The Mexican beans are my personal favorites.

I am guessing that I will be happy with these and order from this company again. Price and service left me fully satisfied. However, I can't comfortably rate them until I actually use them.This rating is partially a guess so I can let future customers considering these beans know about the lack of resealable container and the pleasing appearance.

review/text: I feel these are the best strawberry buds that are being made today. They are extremely fresh and very fruity. They have a good taste to them and the inside gel is equally as tasty. If you are looking for some great strawberry buds and you don't want to buy a mixed bag with other candies you won't eat this is the way to go.

review/summary: Top Notch Arcor Sweets
review/text: There are other imitators out there, but none compare with the Arcor product. After trying another "similar" brand, I found them to be fine taste-wise, but the Arcor Buds do not get that "wrapper stuck to the candy" problem that requires you to literally peel little pieces of the wrapper away from the candy....no stick!!!<br /><br />The product arrived packed well and is everything I was looking for at a good and fair price

Brand X.  These don't look or taste anywhere near as good as the earlier Arcor brand.

review/summary: Best vanilla bean
review/text: Absolutely the best flavor vanilla bean I have tasted to date.  No kidding.  My kids love vanilla icecream so I got a Cusineart ice cream maker and do a batch every week.  I started with the standard Madagascar beans, moved to the gourmet Madagascar beans, tried the Hawaiian (over priced), then tried the Tahitian variety.  Wow, I was very pleased.  The Tahitian has a mellow full flavor.  The Madagascar is harder and doesn't sit on the tongue as well as the Tahitian (Hawaiian is very similar).  For the Fremch custard (8 egg yolks, 40% cream and organic milk) recipie, I find the Tahitian is Excellent! I have bought beans from several distributors online and from local stores.  This seller is excellent, the beans are moist, fresh, vaccuum packed, arrive quickly and taste great.  I have been using this vendor for several orders - always pleased.

review/summary: Odd smell from these beans
review/text: I admit I have not made any vanilla extract with these beans yet. If it smells different than the beans do, I will update my review. When I smelled the vanilla beans through the single layer plastic they came in, it smelled...almost like tobacco. Not cigarettes, but a tobacco plant...mixed with vanilla. A friend of mine who recommended these to me said they did NOT smell right when I let her smell them today. She's been making her own extract with these beans for a while. I hate to think I wasted $20. It really doesn't make me excited to try this company again. Not sure I want to waste vodka trying to make extract from a bad batch. So buyer beware. I probably just got unlucky somehow.

review/summary: Disappointed.
review/text: I'm not sure if I'm the only one who got a bad bunch of beans or previous reviewers are unfamiliar with good quality beans, however, mine were not. The beans I received today were very old and brittle. Also, I thought they smelled like soap or cheap perfume. They can't be cut open with a knife without breaking into several pieces. Some of the beans cracked into pieces in their bag merely upon pulling them out of the padded envelope they werte mailed in. I've ordered beans before from a company who no longer sells them online and they were always plump, tender and very fragrant with rich, sweet vanilla. I'm very disappointed! Also, I don't believe these were Beanilla vanilla beans! My bag only had a generic label saying 'Tahitian Vanilla'.<br /><br />*Update:<br /><br />After using the beans I found the flavor was very good, however, I could only scrape about a third of the seeds from one whole bean I've gotten from a half of one fresher bean. It was also hard to scrape the seeds from the very dry, brittle beans. I wanted them for ice cream, but for extract I think they'd be great.<br /><br />For flavor alone, 4 or 5 stars.

review/text: Having heard vanilla beans were even more expensive than even good vanilla extract, I had always shied away from even looking them up, but at $12 for 25 (essentially $.50 ea) you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not giving these a try. I love the floral accents unique to Tahitian beans, and they will be sure to take your dish to the next level.<br /><br />I received my beans from Beanilla and was very pleased. They came in a resealable vacuum bag and were extremely fragrant when first opened. I'm always apprehensive about ordering food on the internet (I like being able to hand pick and examine what I'm buying), I can confidently say I would definitely go through them again.

review/summary: My second perfect order
review/text: Last summer I began making my own Vanilla extract. Knowing nothing about it I ordered these beans from Amazon. I did a little research and found these to be the least expensive and from the reviews, good beans. They were really great. When the extract came out very well I decided to make more for Christmas gifts. I needed them fast as the extract takes quite a few weeks to reach the desired strength. I ordered these again, they arrived very quickly, were the same beautiful quality, and vacuum packed, as the last time. These beans are long, moist and plump, everything you'd look for in a great quality bean. When I got the request for this review today, I was just sitting down at the computer to order more. My list of baking friends and family, to give the extract to, has grown and I'm depleting my own supply. I bake constantly and plan to never buy commercial Vanilla extract again. I bought my sister an ice cream maker for Christmas and will be giving her some of these beans for Vanilla bean ice cream. Don't ever hesitate to buy these!

review/text: A co-worker used to use this product.  The spray remains in the air and can be detected as a heavy scent several yards away (huge warehouse-type building), and caused asthmatic reactions after use in normal-sized rooms.  He kindly shared the product information with me AND ceased using it out of concern for those affected.  Many individuals later expressed privately to me that the odor was repulsive, even if it had not been over-strong (it is apparently impossible to apply the spray version of this product "lightly").  So if you are trying to be a chick magnet, DON'T buy this product.  "Your cologne is making me gag and nearly pass out" isn't the conversation you want to start with "the ladies."

review/text: I had first tasted this cake at the store in Key West. In fact, I tried every flavor of the free samples they had available. For years, I have wanted to order one of these cakes, but the minimum order from the Tortuga catalogue was more than I wanted to deal with. Besides that, the shipping and handling was quite high. When I saw the cakes available through Amazon, I still thought they were pricey, but super-saver free shipping was available, so I ordered two cakes, one for my family and one for a friend. The cake did not dissapoint. It was delicious, moist and delicious, and the rum was not overpowering. By eating just a sliver at a time, my husband, son, and I made the 16oz cake last nearly a week. It was a nice holiday treat.

review/text: Great price from Amazon on the Tortuga rum cake since it's about half from the local liquor store. Since we had them before and loved them so we ordered 3 16oz cakes as gifts from Amazon. Two turned out to be moldy and the other was fine. The problem is there's no way to tell on the box when these things were made nor was there a "Best consume by date" anywhere so we have no idea how "fresh" or how old these things are. There is a small white label on the bottom with some 7 digit numbers but we have no idea what they stand for nor could we decipher their code. We contacted Amazon and they didn't know about the date code either. Should you buy them from Amazon, buy them for your own consumption and not as gifts so if they turn out to be bad, you can get an exchange or refund thus saving you embarassment from your relatives or friends who ended up with your moldy gifts. Or try to contact Amazon to find out when they were made before sending them off to your friends.

If you like a soft and moist cake not sort of dry and spongy this is the cake for you.  They have lots of different flavors as well.  Hope this helps someone.

The cake is very moist and the rum is not overpowering.  It's also not overloaded with nuts -- just a light sprinkling on top is all.  I'm giving this 4 out of 5 stars only because I think it's a bit pricey.  However, I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys rum cake or has wanted to try one and is willing to pay a little more than average for it -- I think you'll like!

With that said I am Jamaican myself and I bought this on a trip back up to the states and have been hooked ever since. I go back just to get this but something told me to try Amazon CAUSE AMAZON HAS EVERYTHING :) and I was delighted to know that its on here. I will be buying these things until I am sick of it and can't eat it anymore.

review/summary: A Good Cake With A Lot That's Fake!
review/text: I am a rum cake aficionado and have tried many.  Of course, the best are those you make yourself from scratch with love and lots of good rum. I gave Tortuga 3 stars because it seems to be a popular rum cake standard that consistently tastes good in comparison to similar commercial quality products within this group. Tortuga cakes are actually produced in Barbados with the company headquartered in the Cayman Islands and I imagine that this affects the steep cost of these cakes. Here is my critique of the pros and cons based on multiple purchases:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1. A moist cake with a clear rum presence.<br />2. Same brand is available in many popular flavors.<br />3. Contains Tortuga 5 year old aged Gold rum.<br />4. One of the most popular choices for rum cakes.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. Tortuga uses many artificial colors and preservatives-e.g. Yellow 5 & 6, sodium propionate, artifical flavors, sodium alginate, polysorbate 60, propylene glycol and aluminum sulfate.  In my opinion, this compromises the taste and integrity of the product, making it less than "natural". The box reads..."A Taste of the Islands" but it should read..."A Taste of the Lab!"<br /><br />2. The amount of true rum is negligible at best-less than 1/2 of 1%, which in a 1 lb. cake amounts to .0008 oz. Add your own rum more generously!<br /><br />3. To a discerning palate, these rum cakes taste as they are made-artificial-similar to the smell of a can of Play Dough when we were kids! A first glance at the cake tells you that the fluorescent yellow color does not exist in nature. Be sure to wear your sunglasses as you cut a slice or you will be blinded by the intense radioactive glow.<br /><br />4. Freshness/Expiration/Use By Date:  Another enigma! Look for the white square sticker on the side of the box. They use a Julian code to identify the date of manufacture of the cake.  For example, "12233" indicates that the cake was produced on the 233rd day of 2012 (August 20th, 2012). Better transparency for consumers would be helpful as would a clear "Use By" date. (Remember that it took decades for most US manufacturers to put easy to read expiration dates on their products.  The Islands are about 30 years behind us.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />This is a 3.5 star product in my opinion. However, I have yet to discover a better tasting commercial rum cake. Make your own using a good recipe and great rum and pocket the savings.  Hope this helps.

review/text: My mother brought me back this kind of rum cake after she visited Jamaica for a wedding. I had never had rum cake and I thought it would taste sort of nasty like raw rum had just been dumped into sweet cake batter. When I tasted it I was pleasantly surprised to note that it tasted nothing like I expected. I told myself I'd just take a couple of bites but before I knew  it I had consumed 3/4ths of it (giving the rest to my mom)! The whole cake is 400 calories so they should warn people! You cant take just one bite!:)

review/text: We first tried this cake when we were on Grand Caymans and there was no turning back after that first taster.  The cake is moist, sweet and laced with a generous portion of rum. The cake is sealed in a vacuum sealed bag that helps maintain its moisture.  Dont worry once you open the bag because I doubt it that it will last for more than a couple of days!<br /><br />Just so pleased that this item is on Prime delivery and that Amazon is supporting this product.  It is great as a gidt idea, but only if you are ready to part with it!

review/text: This cake was just ok. It's a bit too soggy and for the price, it runs very small. I much prefer the rum cake from Fantasicakes I ordered last month. You get so much more cake, so much more flavor. The quality is easy to see and taste. Tortuga has great packaging, so I love the box more then anything. But I'm not buying this cake for it's packaging, And for me, it just didn't live up to the hype. Tortuga is good, not great.

review/text: So, when I first got this, of course I waited until the kids went to bed to indulge into my rum cake. The first taste was so delicious that before I knew it the whole thing was gone but that is OK that is what it is for. I was honestly surprised that they were so fresh even after the travel to get to me and the taste was spot on with the freshness of the rum cake. The smell was really nice too. I am one that I see my food first and decide on if I am going to like it, then I go to the smell of the food then I finally taste it. The Tortuga Rum Cake exceeded all expectations but that wasn't too hard since this was my first time eating rum cake.

Don't know what other rum cakes tastes like, but this one is definitely very good.  Will for sure be getting other ones to try out.<br /><br />The soft moist cake isn't so full of rum that it feels overdone.  Some local bakers here go overboard with the wine and it's too soft, almost watery.  This one still has a cake feel.  Microwave it for 30 seconds, add on whipcream and ice cream, sit back, relax, watch some basketball, now that's truely a good time.  For the health factor, I add in some fresh fruits so I can tell my wife, hey, this is the way I eat fruits!

review/text: I was very disappointed with this product. I ordered it because it was highly recommended on the Food Network and also on the Travel Channel. I did not think the cake had much rum taste (sort of like it had been sprinkled very lightly with the Carbbean rum) and it was much more dense than I thought it would be. I tried "doctoring" it up a bit with more liquor, whipped cream, etc without success. Although one could eat it, it was not the best and I wound up throwing half of it out. I would suggest saving your money and making your own Bacardi Rum cake. You will be much happier with the product.
