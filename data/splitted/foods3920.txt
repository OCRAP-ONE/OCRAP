review/summary: Some of the best chips anywhere
review/text: Kettle chips are thicker and crunchier (though greasier at times) than other chips, and the honey dijon flavor is great.  They don't have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have, and the 2oz size is great for an adult size snack.

review/summary: the defacto standard for Salt and Vinegar chips
review/text: I've always liked Salt and Vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag. Not with these, the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and doesnt stop until you've finished the bag. These are very addictive. If you like salt and vinegar, these are the ultimate chips. Nothing else compares.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're "kettle chips" and they're "fried" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!

review/text: This bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool, such as scissors, don't even try without scissors.<br /><br />They are crispy and taste like chips that aren't advertised as being salted. They definitely aren't healthy, because I can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them, and I can see the grease at the bottom of the bag, too.<br /><br />They are high-quality chips, and deserve to be put on your table.

review/text: I agree with the company motto "A Natural Obsession".  I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent.  The flavor of these is very strong, so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor, like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread.  Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food.

Unfortunately, it may do the opposite to your backside, so don't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroom.<br /><br />I still give it a 5 of 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, the online price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I've seen them. Combined with Amazon Prime you'll be getting a great deal on these chips.

review/text: These are my new favorite!  I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one!  They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.<br /><br />Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here.  I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping.  I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price.  The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Kettle Foods Spicy Thai Chips
review/text: The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed "ginger with attitude" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  "Great Taste Naturally" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!

I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again!<br />I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring.

review/summary: 4 Stars for price and taste
review/text: I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars.

review/text: We've long enjoyed this brand of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.<br /><br />  Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans.  I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.<br /><br />  How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt.

review/text: The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!

review/summary: Things you need to know
review/text: Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes "too much". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are "Krinkle Cut" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems.

review/summary: I made a mistake.....
review/text: This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  � homiedog �

review/text: I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.

But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.

review/text: I literally could not live without the Monthly Comfort tea. A friend recommended it to me for "the time of the month" and I tried it skeptically - especially as I am not a mother, a soon to be mother, or motherly at all. I start drinking at least a cup of this three to four days before my cycle, and find that most of the monthly annoyance of being a woman subsides. What was a week of unpleasantness, with two days of insomnia because the pain is so bad has no turned into a day or two max of light cramps, with no bloating either.<br /><br />To me it tastes like cinnamon and ginger, with raspberry undertones. It tastes delicious enough that I often have it all month long, not just on my cycle. It's especially pleasant on a chilly morning.<br /><br />I buy this in bulk now, because running out is simply not an option!

review/summary: Exceptional product!
review/text: I've battled horrific periods for years, especially after the birth of my second child.  I wish I would have known about this many years ago!  This tea is absolutely fantastic.  I typically have issues with gaining upwards of 10 lbs of water weight during my menstrual cycle - not this time.  Cramping is significantly reduced, water weight is non-existent, even my husband commented on my much improved monthly demeanor.<br /><br />The tea is easy to make, though I would certainly recommend steeping for a solid 15 minutes for best results.  I drink two cups of this tea each day (morning and afternoon) starting a few days before my cycle and all the way through.  I do not normally enjoy tea, but I have to say, this is delicious.  I didn't even need to add sugar or other sweetener to mask the taste.<br /><br />I have used most of the Earth Mama tea products, and have been impressed by the high quality, delicious flavors, and natural remedies for my ails.  I highly recommend giving this product a try.

review/text: Not that I've tasted this stuff, mind you, but according to my fussy Persian, he thinks it hung the moon!  The grilled and roasted varieties provide some sort of "extra" punch of flavor for him so, well, must be a guy thing because my female won't touch any of it.  Weird, I know, but I think it goes back to that tailgating thing guys do with the brats and other "guy stuff."  My male is all over the beef and grilled varieties but my female, she prefers the pates.  Overall, the quality of this food is awesome, better than Iams and worth the price.  It's about $6 higher here than what I pay for it but I'm in Ohio, the armpit capital of the world so things are cheaper here so they can get us to stay..... Highly recommend!

review/summary: Good quality food for kitty.
review/text: As my 19 year old cat, Jill, has approached her 20th birthday, she has become more finicky with her food.  I've found this particular brand and flavor is the only thing she will eat.  Since putting her on a diet of this food, she's regained over a pound (she was down to almost 8 pounds and not eating) and is fast approaching her ideal weight once again.<br /><br />It's more expensive than other brands, but well worth the price considering the turnaround I've seen with Jill.

review/summary: My kitty does NOT like this style of food
review/text: This stuff is little bits in a sauce rather than a pate-style product.  Kitty does NOT like, although she loves most FF flavors.  She will grudgingly eat it if she's really hungry, but half the time there are still bits left in her dish the next day, albeit licked quite clean of any trace of sauce. (she LOVES sauce - if they ever make a canned catfood that's all sauce, she'll be in heaven)<br /><br />Even our big orange tabby, who's a former street cat and will eat just about anything, (I've seen him eat cooked carrots) doesn't care much for it.<br /><br />If your cats like pate-style food and don't go for the bits and shreds and other flaked-and-form styles, they probably won't like this one either.  Mine didn't.

review/text: Ok my cat's name is not Mr Butters. He's Matthew. But Mr Butters comes out (ok maybe just in my head) when he eats his grilled chicken fancy feast. I like this stuff so much for him I have subscribed to,eh, subscribe and save. I was tempted to get Martha Stewart feeding bowls just for this stuff. That thought lasted for a minute. But hey, I considered it, that's how good this stuff is. And for those of you who are interested, Mr Butters has great bowel movement on this food plus his dry foods during the day.

review/summary: Big savings+Many choices+Great convenience= Happy Cats & owner
review/text: Amazon offers dozens of Fancy Feast choices in all categories i.e. fish, chicken, beef more than any store in my town, excepting a large Pet store chain and they charge 30% MORE and are in a large commercial setting 7 miles away.  Not convenient when I run out of their favorite or my local grocery store runs out.<br /><br />With the "Subscribe and Save" plan the price comes to about 57 cents per can for the Grilled Chicken Feast.  NOTE:  price will vary according to what flavor you order.<br /><br />For the same item, my local grocery chain store charges 78 cents per can (incl. tax)  no matter what the flavor and 84 cents per can (incl. tax) for the "Elegant" line of Fancy Feast.  Some other  gourmet type stores in town charge even MORE.<br /><br />I have read some reviewers say they can find it cheaper than Amazon but that has not been my experience.  Some reviewers are comparing prices of different brands to Fancy Feast so that doesn't compute logically.<br /><br />If you know your cat loves this upper end brand, don't want to run out, are interested in a great deal, then sign up now with Subscribe and Save (best price) OR just order a case as you need it.<br /><br />As someone with 2 cats who goes through 120 cans a month, I assure you, this has made me a happy camper!  In addition, convenience means a lot to me.  Often my store is out of the flavor my cats prefer and/or discontinue it.<br /><br />One day in frustration as my store informed me they were no longer carrying a particular flavor, and had run out 2x of another,  I turned to the Internet.  As usual,  Amazon saved the day!  Subscribe and Save now.  You can change the frequency and Amazon will send you an email alert to notify you of shipping date about a week ahead so you can cancel that shipment or ask them to ship it sooner.  It's a no brainer :  )<br /><br />PS  No, my cats are NOT fat in case you wondered :  )

review/text: Woo.  I get Purina Friskies "Meaty Bits" grilled chicken with gravy for $0.55/5.5 oz = $0.10/oz at the grocery story.  This is what my cat is used to, but I'm willing to take the week to patiently switch her to something else if it's worth it.  This isn't.<br /><br />This Purina Fancy Feast "Chicken Feast in Gravy" product is very similar to the "Meaty Bits" but even with all of the "Subscribe & Save" savings, and free shipping, it ends up being $15.99/72 oz  = $0.22/oz - the same price as my other cat's prescription food and more than double what I'm currently paying.<br /><br />Phooey.  This means I'm going to have to go back and crunch the numbers of the other S&S things I've ordered.  Shoulda woulda coulda known:  no free lunch.

review/summary: Excellent but not outstanding chocolates
review/text: See's Candies is a well-known San Francisco chocolate company, now with stores throughout the United States.  In California, the lines to buy chocolate can snake out the door.  I've had See's Candies many times, most recently this assortment, and while See's makes an excellent product, the chocolate coating could be richer in flavor.  Still, these confections are above average; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman's with fresher and more flavorful fillings.<p>Anyone receiving a box of See's Candies for a gift knows that an extra effort has been made.  Although they aren't the best I've had, they certainly rank up there with the finest chocolate assortments available in a box.

review/summary: The BEST candy EVER!!!
review/text: I've tried the rest, but this is the BEST!<br /><br />I've been eating See's candies since I was just a kid!  Easter was one of my favorite holidays, because my mom would order See's large easter eggs, we would get to pick our favorite filling, Chocolate or Chocolate Walnut, then we'd get a medium chocolate egg, I would always choose the Bordeaux (by far the best flavored candy See's sells), you could get the divinity if you liked that.  The buttercream is always a huge favorite at our house.  You have your choice of Dark or Milk chocolate. Choose your own liking!  I prefer Milk chocolate.  Another of my favorites is California Brittle.  Also, the Vanilla Nut Carmel (no chocolate on this one), but very tasty!<br /><br />Just remember the Assorted premade box doesn't always have the best picks in it.  If you like nuts and chews, that's one of the better choices.  I prefer to go down to See's and select my own mix!  Pecan turtles--just melt in your mouth.  Try the truffles if you like!<br /><br />Never did like Godiva or Fanny Farmer, once in awhile I could take a piece of Helen Grace or Lindt, but they never live up to my standards.<br />See's is the perfect candy and it makes the perfect gift for family, friends, co-workers, neighbors, service company's and the postal person.  Don't cross anyone off your list until you surprise them with a gift of See's candy for the Holidays.

review/text: I purchased this to give the home ordering thing a try. I'd never purchased frozen meat online before, so this was a new adventure. The pictures looked great, and the chicken itself looked like good cuts of meat.<br />Unfortunately, I received this shipment in dry ice - but the ice had almost completely thawed, leaving the chicken inside warm to the touch (can't risk salmonella, do I contacted the seller). The seller credited my purchase back to me, and assured me that future orders would be packed in more ice to make it to California during the summer months. I am going to reorder this shipment, because even though the chicken was not able to be eaten, it LOOKED very tasty, the cuts were generous and weighed just as much as the listing claimed, and aside from the temperature issue, the product looked just as it does in the pictures.<br />Add to that some incredibly stellar customer service, and this may be an item that I purchase regularly for quite some time to come!

review/text: Good News for Corn Syrup Lovers - It contains plenty of High Fructose Corn Syrup.<br />It is very sweet.<br />Personally, I don't understand why any sweetener is added to pickled beets at all and why Amazon.com doesn't give more info about products they sell. I never thought that pickled beets could have High Fructose Corn Syrup.<br />Of course, You can make your own pickled beets, I usually do when I have the time.<br />It is simple.<br />Take 2 pounds of beets, wash, peel, slice or julienne them.<br />Place them in a glass jar, cover with boiled and chilled water (or bottled if you don't like fluoride) add 3-4 table spuns of salt, a few cloves of sliced garlic, a small piece of horseradish, bay leaf and put aside for a week or 10 days in room temperature.<br />After that, remove any scum formed on the surface of the beets (you can strained through the cheesecloth) and place them in the refrigerator.<br />You get delicious naturally sweet, pickled beets and juice without any sugar added.<br />Enjoy it.

I suggest looking for the three pack that comes in plastic rather than this product that comes in a box.  If I had ordered this product first, I would have never ordered this brand again.

review/summary: Great alternative, add it to anything.
review/text: Just the facts:<br /><br />*Put in in coffee, put it in cocoa, put it in cereal, put in on icecream, drink it cold or hot.<br /><br />*This browhish-pink drink dissolves very quickly in milk instead of turning in to a paste like cocoas do in even hot milk.<br /><br />*It has vitamins in it, unlike chocolate milk, but it doesn't leave an aftertaste in your mouth.<br /><br />*It's way less sweet than chocolate syrup. I recommend it for diabetics & people who just have limited tollerance for sweetness or prefur dark european chocolate over american milk chocolate.<br /><br />*It tastes significantly different from chocolate milk, but it's deffinately chocolate.<br /><br />*Unlike cocoa or chocolate milk, it won't make you fat or hyper.<br /><br />*Don't be a slob & leave any unfinished portion out for  several nights or it will turn blue & smell awful.<br /><br />*I've been drinking this stuff since I was still spitting out baby teeth. A tank this size lasts me up to 3 weeks & reduces junk food cravings.<br /><br />*If you email Ovaltine with feedback, they will send you a coupon.<br /><br />*Comes in Malt, chocolate, Chocomalt, but not in strawberry or vanilla.

review/text: our family really loves the taste of nestle ovaltine rich chocolate mix.  we used to use the original flavor but find the malt a little too much. this rich chocolate flavor is more like a chocolate milk. the added vitamins are a bonus. i serve it hot or cold, it's great either way!  the kids (2) have a glass in the morning nearly everyday and sometimes more after school. the three pack is a good amount for us.<br />i find amazon to be less expensive than my grocery store but i'm in brooklyn, ny. and mark up tends to be high.<br />the photo of the product shows the screw top lid but ours came in the replaceable lid version. not really any problem though.<br />the product contains whey from milk and soy lecithin so if those ingredients are a problem for you you're out of luck :( there's a # on the container so you can call if you have more Q's 1-800-442-0099<br /> btw~i tried mixing it in my coffee one time to see if it would make a moca but it doesn't work for me.i don't use milk in my coffee though so you might try your own experiments:)

review/summary: The New and Improved Recipe is Horrible!
review/text: My children and I immediately noticed a difference in the taste and texture of the "New and Improved" recipe.  It is awful!  Some have commented on a slight difference in flavor, but for us, it was completely different, and disgusting.  We have switched to Carnation Instant Breakfast and at times, plain old Hershey's Syrup!  We used to buy three cans each of Chocolate and Malt Ovaltine, every few weeks, but we will not buy more until the recipe is changed back to the original.  This change was so very upsetting to our family.  My kids only liked Ovaltine in their milk.<br /><br />This change was unnecessary, uncalled-for and is ruining the brand name Ovaltine after so many generations of loyalty.  This change reminds me of "New Coke!"

It's rancid compared to the old formula. Shame on nestle for this.

review/summary: Not rawhide, not munchy
review/text: Perhaps some consider dipping packed rice stick treats in emulsified rawhide enough to label them as "rawhide", but certainly I do not.  I like to give a rawhide stick to my Boston terrier most mornings while I'm getting ready to leave for work so she doesn't get anxious, but she bites these sticks in half immediately and they're gone within seconds!  In my mind, rawhide chews are meant to be gnawed on for at least 10 mins.<br /><br />They also gave her some stomach upset and diarrhea, which no other rawhide product ever has.  The "made in China" label should have made me suspicious immediately.  I'm tossing what's left of the bag and never buying these again.  My hope in leaving this review is that no one else will be fooled by the "rawhide" label.

review/text: For a low price, you get a hundred of these sticks. What a bargain, especially since they keep the dog occupied while chewing it (albeit for only a couple of minutes!). My dog loves them. Some other reviewers have said that they stink, but I haven't experienced that at all. It is possible this is because my dog eats the whole thing each sitting. The sticks themselves do not smell so it is likely other reviewers' complaints have stemmed from their dogs chewing but not finishing the sticks, and the dog's saliva mixed with the otherwise fine stick produces the reported putrid smell.

review/summary: "Rawhide" is Misleading
review/text: I purchased these thinking that they would be the same as the white rawhide twists that you buy in pet stores.  These "Rawhide" munchy sticks are NOT the same type of product.<br /><br />If you're looking for something for your dog to chew on, look elsewhere.  This product is more like a beef jerky-type treat for dogs.<br /><br />The ingredients list is enlightening.  The ingredient list for this product is: Rawhide, Rice Flour, Maltodextrin, Artificial Flavor, Artificial Colors (FD&C Yellow #6, FD&C Red #40, and FD&C Blue #1).<br />As a comparison, the rawhide twists I buy for my dog to chew on has the following ingredient list: Beef Rawhide.  That's it.<br /><br />I would characterize this product as a treat, rather than a rawhide or a bone.  My dachshund/beagle mix chews through one in about 15-20 seconds.  It has the consistency of a pretzel.<br /><br />As for being a treat, my dog eats them, but isn't exactly crazy about them.  She usually eats them when provided, but I have seem them lying about the house, so it's not like her other treats that she will ravenously dig into as soon as she sees it.  I would not make the mistake of buying this product again.

review/summary: pop tarts
review/text: Blueberry Pop Tarts, without frosting, are not sold in the stores any longer. It was a great pleasure to be able to find them at Amazon. My husband only likes the non frosted tarts and they are difficult to find. I called Kellogg and asked why they don't have more flavors that are unfrosted and the answer was there was no demand, most people liked the frosted, so that left my husband without his favorite foods. We also bought the frosted American Apple pie, which to my delight he enjoyed as well. Thanks Amazon, for giving me a happy husband again and another 42 years of wedded bliss.
