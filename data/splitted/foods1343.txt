review/summary: Love!
review/text: I have a new found love for spicy foods. I like traditional sriracha, but found this while eating at Newks and fell in love. This sriracha has more of a garlic flavor to it than traditional sriracha and is slightly less spicy. Everyone I have let try it loves it. It is great on everything!

review/summary: Not worthy of the "Sriracha" name.
review/text: I've mentioned this sauce in my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZZM">Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce</a>. When shopping in the Strip District in Pittsburgh I picked up a couple bottles of this thinking it was something different. And it is in a bad way.<br /><br />The sauce has a runny consistency with a distinct taste of corn syrup. There is marginal chile and garlic taste and tasted either overcooked or old despite its freshness date. This is what Huy Fong aptly described as a "counterfeit": The packaging tries to look quite similar to the genuine Sriracha. It's as cut-rate as you can get. It's foul stuff.<br /><br />How can anyone mess up a hot sauce? Maybe that's why it has caution-yellow caps and ink: To warn you to keep away from this and buy the genuine, thick and full-bodied original. This is not worthy of the "Sriracha" name.

review/summary: excellent!
review/text: expiration date is 08/2012 so no problem there, if you like sweet/hot chili sauce these will be long gone before 13 months is up. Sriracha sauce is good on pizza, any Mexican food, most oriental foods, soups, etc.<br /><br />a little sweeter and not quite as hot as the 'Rooster' sauce that has the green cap <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZHO">Huy Fong, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>. still very hot and very garlicky and very good! this was much cheaper (nearly $13 less!) using the Subscribe and Save option than Rooster sauce so i decided to give it a try and its a good substitute. from now on i will just buy Roland because its almost as good and a lot cheaper.<br /><br />get some of these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQJT1O">Nong Shim Bowl Noodle, Hot and Spicy</a> and give them a good squirt of Sriracha for a really tasty lunch!

review/summary: the best chili  sauce  ever
review/text: this is the best sriracha chili sauce i have ever found.  the garlic and tanginess grabs you by the throat and says  "LICK ME"  AND TRUST ME PEOPLE,  YOU MUST COMPLY.  i purchased this product under the subscribe and save program that includes a 15% discount and FREE SHIPPING.  these bottles measures about 9 inches tall and weigh 17 ounces.  i want you to try and guess how much it would cost to ship approximately 6 1/2 pounds of product not including bubble wrap and double boxing.  the price per bottle ends up being $2.63 per bottle.  these puppies shipped in a good size box.  the usage for this chili sauce is limited only by your imagination.  can you say asian, BBQ., added to catsup(french fries), sauces, adding heat to spaghetti sauce.

Additionally, I am unable to return the item per Amazon's policy. Now the item is not even listed anymore (that's why I'm posting the review to the decaf version of the soda even though I purchased the caffeinated version).<br />Buyer Beware!

review/text: First of all, 5 stars for Goya Mojo Criollo.  It is fabulous.  I use it to marinate everthing:  chicken, fish, shrimp, pork, or beef.  If you love tangy, citrusy, flavorful food then this is the best marinade in my opinion.  It also helps keep the food moist.  However 1 star for Amazon Grocery, I was pretty annoyed after I bought the two bottles from Amazon for 13.99 and then walked into a regular grocery store to find that each bottle sells for 2.94.

review/text: Mojo criollo is one of the better marinades I've used, and compared to most of the stuff you'll find at the grocery, it's a unique, and to be frank, superior alternative. A mixture of vinegar, spices (garic chief among them), onion and citrus juices (lime, bitter orange), Mojo Criollo will impart a full, tangy flavor to whatever meat or poultry you're cooking, as well as add to it's overall juicyness. Wonderful for grilling (grilled some chicken breasts marinated in it earlier tonight), and a vital addition to black beans if you want to prepare them in the traditional Cuban manner (my mother, a native of Jovellanos, Matanzas in Cuba swears by it...and I'll swear by her black beans).

review/summary: Life changing
review/text: I've been cooking all kinds of flavors for years and only recently tried using pre bought marinades when I heard so many good things about this one in particular. I'd only ever created my own blends so I was a little hesitant to try something from a store shelf. I can't tell you how shocked I was by the flavors in this bottle. It's not oily, but gloriously light and has an intense aroma as soon as you open it. Smells of cumin, citrus, garlic and all things heavenly play together when you use it on beef or chicken. I've yet to try it on pork, but I can only imagine it'd be great as well. When baking chicken, I marinate the breasts in this at least 30 minutes prior to throwing them in the oven with a little of the residual juice from the marinade sitting in the bottom of a baking dish. It keeps everything deliciously moist and perfectly seasoned. One thing I can say is that I usually end up adding just a little extra garlic, crushed red pepper, and salt, depending on what I'm making.<br /><br />It's definitely worth a try:)

review/summary: Get this 12-pack if you love Sriracha!
review/text: Like many others, I can't say enough good things about Huy Fong's Sriracha Hot Chili sauce. There are other brands (some of which blatantly copy the bottle design) but stick with the original.<br />If you've never tried this you probably want to know what all the fuss is about. To summarise, Sriracha adds a kick to just about everything - it's a tasty slightly sweet/somewhat salty chili heat, with a gradual burn that gets better the more you consume. There are hotter hot sauces but often you want to enhance what you're eating - for this Sriracha is great. I find it's especially good with Chinese takeout or anything fried. Pizza, noodles, even a Salad benefits from Sriracha.<br />The only slight disadvantage is that sometimes the chili heat is a bit inconsistent from bottle to bottle. There have been bottles I've tried that aren't all that hot to others that were hotter than normal (and no, for me that isn't a bad thing!).<br />Anyway, I am pretty much addicted to this sauce. You may also want to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SKCVI">Huy Fong Vietnamese Chili Garlic Sauce, 8 Oz.</a> which is better suited for cooking with but you can also use it as a condiment.<br />NOTE: This is the 12-pack Sriracha, which is not much more expensive than the 6-pack so it's a better value. Hope this saves you money!

review/summary: Very tasty candy.
review/text: My mother grew up with Quality Street candy in the 1950's in England.  I've always been partial to Quality Street chocolate over American chocolate.  I took this tin of candy in to the office and it lasted about 3 hours before it was all eaten.

review/summary: I was hoping for a richer coffee
review/text: I'm a huge fan of Kona Coffee, so I decided to treat myself to three small bags of Maui Jim's Hula Pie.  Having never tasted this brand before, it does taste good.  And lends itself well to eating with meals.  But as my wake up cup of joe, I found it a little mild (read weak), and attempts to make increasingly stronger brews were in vain.  Though I might purchase it again for a treat, I definitely won't be replacing my regular brand.

review/summary: so far so good!
review/text: My fuji serissa foetida bonsai came in on time from bonsai boy and in good condition. The only complaint I have is that the trunk and raised roots had a greenish-yellowish tinge to it and I'll have to restore to proper health. I'm sure that was probably from the stress of traveling however during the hot summer with being in a dark box etc. The leaves were in good condition and everything was intact. I would recommend this bonsai because they're beautiful and fairly easy to take care of! If I could I would've gave 4.5 stars instead of 4.

review/summary: Very dissapointed
review/text: I bought a tree from BonsaiBoy web site and Im dissapointed about my purchase. The actual tree is nothing like the one in the product picture on the web site. It is just a straight trunked tree about 2-3 years old potted in a bonsai pot. I could have bought a nicer looking tree from Home Depot and pruned it myself to make it look greater than this. This order costed me around $70 including shipping and the humidity tray. The tray doesnt match the pot (too larget for the pot), so i cant use to diaplay the tree. I bought a nice tree from JoeBonsai couple months ago and i was so happy with that purchase. The tree exactly looked like the one on the product image and i love tree. If you are looking to buy a tree, i recommend JoeBonsai over BonsaiBoy.

review/summary: Pitting was Pity. Old and dry. Full of bugs.
review/text: This review is not about the benefits of the product. I've heard a lot of good things and that's why I bought it.<br /><br />I wish this was not "pitted". At least I would have been pitting them while eating them and expecting a pit in every date. About 1 out of 8 dates only is completely pitted, and the other 7 are either not pitted, half pitted, quarter pitted, crushed pit inside, etc. Whichever technique was used in pitting was a fail and a waste of time and quality. Result is toothaches and possibly breaking tooth or crown if not being very careful. 2 stars gone there.<br /><br />Combination of price + S&H is a little high. 1 star gone there.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />So after trying to ignore all the bad dates I've gotten so far I couldn't take anymore. The dates are full of black dots and many of them have bugs, or bugs' eggs. I found out that where a bitter funky tasting one crushed in my mouth I checked it and it had bugs' eggs. Really? How old are these dates? They're too dry and old. There goes another star.

review/summary: Sweet dates, ready to use
review/text: Chinese red dates or jujubes have been used in Chinese medicine and diet for a hundreds of years. I recently returned from a trip to China and the Chinese like to serve one or two of these dates along with their meals or even make them part of the stir fry dishes; I believe it improves digestion, among providing other health benefits. During my 2 week China stay, I experienced none of my common Western digestive issues (bloating, constipation, heaviness, low energy) so they must be on to something???<br /><br />These are not meant to be a snack food, stick to 2-3 per day. I like them in my oatmeal in the morning.<br /><br />As for the quality, this is a rather large resealable bag. The dates are pitted and appear fresh. No complaints here except the shipping cost was a little high.

Not only is it much better for you than peanut butter (less saturated fat, more protein and fiber), but this one has flax seed version of Omega-3.  We weren't too keen on the Organic variety because they don't have salt or sugar added; the natural line adds just enough to make it much tastier.

And the flax seed not only add mega-nutrition but a delightfully subtle crunch that adds a wonderful texture. Only one slight drawback for me- a little less sweetener would be better. I have been using all natural peanut butter with no sweetener so this tastes a little sweet to me. All in all, a great product and it is on my subscribe list with Amazon to be sent to me automatically.

Even people that don't have a taste for smoked salmon/ sockeye might like this, very mild and extremely flavorful. It's the alder wood I think.

review/summary: Don't Expect to Eat it by Itself...
review/text: There's just simply not a lot of taste in this chicken, but it still has a lot of positives. It doesn't taste bad (or really like anything), it's already cooked so it can very quickly be heated up and eaten (always a plus),  and has a relatively long shelf life (my "best by" gave me a little over two years). But you better plan to add some sort of sauces to this chicken because simply doing something like steaming it with some veggies is going to leave you with no flavor whatsoever.<br /><br />My two tips: if you like stir fry, this works well with some soy sauce and assorted veggies. If you like more traditional, go with a good tasting BBQ sauce that can give the chicken some flavor.<br /><br />5/5 for convenience. 3/5 for taste (or lack of). 4/5 altogether.

review/summary: Hormel White & Dark Chicken in Water, 95% Fat Free, 5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)
review/text: I bought this product to see if it would be useful for preparing meals for one.  I used it to make an egg noodle, chicken, cream sauce dish.  The can size was just about the proper amount of chicken for my dish.  Was able to make a nice single serve entree.  To bad the chicken was about tasteless.  Parts of the chicken contents were tough and stringy.  I think the 'fat free' processing caused the lack of taste.  I gave a can of the chicken a ride in a food processor to make a chicken salad.  Took a lot of seasoning and the addition of onion, pickle, etc. to produce any taste.  The chicken just served as the carrier of the other ingredients.<br />The cats aren't thrilled with it either.<br />The shipping was prompt and the goods arrived damage free.

review/summary: MMM, Chicken in Water!
review/text: I like Chicken. Sometimes I buy a raw whole one from the supermarket. Other times I buy it ready cooked so I can just nom down on it as soon as I get back. So, when I discovered that Hormel produce this product I was skeptical but intrigued. As I said I like chicken, and I am partial to water so surely I would like chicken preserved in water. When the tins arrived I had my can opener ready and waiting. I polished the tin off and felt I had satisfied my poultry needs for the day. To summarise, if you like chicken and you like water then you should have no problems with this product.<br /><br />Also, don't forget that you get 12 tins. So if Bobby, Lisa Marie, Jayden, Kaitlin, Maggie, Ellie, Joanie, Ritchie, Phil and Laura all need feeding as well as yourself and Mummy/Daddy then that's your evening meal sorted in one pop - easy.

review/summary: Fairly Good
review/text: If you don't send water through the same tea disc a 2nd time, and don't add sugar, you will taste too much nutmeg over a cheap assam or green tea (which tastes like dirt). I also squirted some light whip cream in it and over it. After trying the undrinkable Gevalia cappaccino, I was relieved to find something I liked. The creamer isn't bad in this one. I don't know if it's a different kind or if it is a good combination of seasoning. I gave it 3 stars because for this price, Twinings should have used a better grade of tea. It tastes pretty good now, but there is still that lingering aftertaste of earthy tea. With the milk, it fills my insulated glass 3/4 of the way full. One other feature, it smells wonderful brewing! It IS Thanksgiving in a cup (thermal glass, I mean.) Using the 20% coupon at Bed, Bath, & Beyond, you can get the 16 disc (8 servings) pkg. with their free standard shipping for $1.09 per serving (before tax).

review/summary: Made in Michigan since 1866
review/text: I like "Vernor's", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime.  The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is "The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.

review/summary: Too Acidic
review/text: As I began eating, I thought this would be a pleasingly pungent dish.  Over chicken, it had a rich tomato flavor without tasting like boring old spaghetti sauce.  As it lingered on my tongue, I detected hints of fenugreek and cilantro, which blended well without dominating the dish.  I remember thinking, I could make this part of my regular menu.<br /><br />But as I ate, its acidic nature asserted itself.  It burned my tongue, stung my throat going down, and left my gums so tender that I could feel my pulse.  Though I stirred in all my rice, I couldn't cut the acid sting.  I started dreading the next forkful, because the acid was so powerful that it pushed everything else out of my mouth.<br /><br />Laying in bed that night, I had bad reflux and had to swallow a fistful of antacid.  Sadly, for such a tasty dish, the acidity overpowers the pleasing flavor.  I usually needs a dash of cayenne to liven up a meat dish, but this was too much for me.  I'll long for that pungent flavor, but this sauce is too acidic to eat regularly.

They haven't actually told me that, but they come running when they think they're going to get one.<br /><br />The thing I don't get... why does the packaging need to be so over the top.  The 10 pack comes in a thick corrugated cardboard box, presumably becuase they're being shipped UPS.  But, then each plastic food tray also has a cardboard sleeve around it. Why do they need this?  It just creates more garbage...<br /><br />And of course, just like all wet food, no matter how carefully you open it and put it in a dish, you always get that stinky liquid on your hands!  Cut down on the packaging and make it easier to open without the thing exploding on your hands!

review/text: Everyone gets a little sad now and then; it's just part of life. But when I'm feeling angsty and emo, I don't want to wallow in it, or find the cure at the bottom of six pints of Cherry Garcia. Nor am I interested in paying some guy three bills an hour to lie on his couch and debate whether his ink blot collection resembles Russell Brand Chia pets or my mother's wahooga.<br /><br />I figured there had to be a quick fix pick-me-up, somewhere in all of the products that Amazon sells.<br /><br />The product description says this is a mood and energy enhancer, and may be beneficial for anxiety, stress, digestive upset, male impotency and vitality, menstrual disorder, PMS, anti-spasmodic, cellular regeneration, apoptosis and vision loss, among others. I've got at least three of those things, and maybe all of them. I'm not sure what a few of them ARE, exactly, but I could still have them. Or want them. It's not entirely clear which side of the fence saffron is on in some of those cases, frankly.<br /><br />Anyway, I needed the mood enhancing, so I bought a jar and added a little to my next meal. I'm pleased to report that the taste of the saffron really 'zings' up the taste of top ramen, more than any spice packet I've ever tried. So I guess it 'enhanced my mood' in that way, at least. And I absolutely experienced no vision loss, spasms, PMS, male vitality or regenerating cells while I was eating or for hours afterward. So it delivers what it promises. Thumbs up!

review/summary: Good, but bitter after taste
review/text: I bought this tea because of all the great reviews and the decent value it presented. I'll start off by saying that I'm an avid Earl Grey fan and have tried a variety of brands (Taylors of Harrogate, Harney & Sons, Coffee Bean, Tazo, etc.). I've tried both bagged and loose leaf versions. I will also preface the review by saying that I like a good amount of bergamot in my Earl Grey.<br /><br />This is a good black tea, but it's not an exceptional Earl Grey tea. For me, it severely lacks in the bergamot department. There's also a heavy bitter after taste  if I let it seep for more than 3 minutes.<br /><br />In the future, I will stick with Taylors, which has been consistent for me in taste and quality, without any lingering bitter flavors.

review/text: This chili powder is pretty good.  If you're looking to it specifically to add some dark pigment to your chili, it's not really that much darker than your off the shelf McCormick.  I has an amazing flavor tho, really heavy on the chipotle, nice and smokey.  I suggest putting your chosen amount into a skillet and slowing raising the temp to toast the powder.  It can take quite awhile because you want to toast, not burn, but it'll start gently smoking and darkening.  I've found this really brings out the flavor AND gets you the color you're probably looking for.  Hope this helps!
