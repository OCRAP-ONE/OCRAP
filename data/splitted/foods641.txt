review/summary: A Great Spicy, Healthy Snack!!
review/text: Blue Diamond Bold Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are a great snack.  Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts that you can eat, and the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor is very similar to chipotle.  This isn't too surprising since a chipotle is a smoked jalapeno after all.  From a nutrition stand point, the only special consideration that doesn't come will all almonds is the 180 mg of sodium per serving.  Unless you get a plain, unsalted nut this is pretty typical.  I like to keep a can of these either in my desk or in the pantry at home for snacking.  Grabbing a handful of these is great between meals when hunger strikes.  So if you are looking for a spicy snack that is fairly healthy, give these a try.

review/text: These almonds are delicious. When you first start chewing, they taste like the plain Smokehouse brand. After a few seconds the Jalapeno heat kicks in. Not overwhelming but just enough to make the snack wanting you to eat a few more. Only bad part is that they are not available in the 38oz tub or jar like the Habanero BBQ flavor that is a better value. If you like them as I do, you can go through a 6oz can very quickly.

review/text: I became hooked on these tasty tidbits, but after a while, I couldn't find them at my local stores anymore.  I tried Amazon and found I could order them in packs of six.  While the price is a little higher than I'd like, that is overridden by the fact that I can indeed get them, and they are delivered right to my door.  Ordering two packs gives me free shipping, too. These almonds are delicious by themselves, but when mixed with dark chocolate, they become irresistible.  The yummy recipe goes like this: take two almonds and one Hershey's dark chocolate kiss.  Pop the two almonds in your mouth and chew a little. Then pop in the chocolate kiss and chew, mixing the two together.  Sheer bliss!  I've become addicted and don't know what I'd do if these flavored almonds ever become unavailable.

review/text: I like lime and I like chili so I figured this would be a pretty tasty nut. It is definitely very flavorful but the lime overpowers the chili so much that the chili might as well be nonexistent. So if you are a lime lover you will probably enjoy this flavor, otherwise you might want to try one of the other varieties instead.  Personally I will finish up this batch but once they're gone I will go back to my habanero bbq and wasabi.

review/summary: The best almonds!
review/text: I originally found the big jar of these at Costco. They had them for about a minute and then they were gone. Thank goodness for Amazon, because I'm hooked on these almonds. If you like anything salt & vinegar, you'll love 'em! Now if Amazon could offer the large economy-size jar, all would be right with the world.

review/text: I do like the Lime taste. It's pretty strong, and very unique. However, at no point in time did I feel like I was eating "Lime and Chili" almonds. There was absolutely no kick from the chili.<br /><br />Very tasty still, but not what I was hoping for.

review/text: I love these almonds - they are the perfect snack, you don't need to eat a lot to feel satisfied. Also, since they have a lot of flavor, you feel "mouth-satisfied" as well. The wasabi is not too hot (actually I wish it were just a little hotter) and the soy just adds a little bit of saltiness. I recommend these if you like wasabi peas but want something with more nutritional value.

review/summary: Full of flavor
review/text: To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor.

A few days ago I was running and I got really light headed. I thought, "hey that happens, it's hot out..." But yesterday I ate a few of these and I realized, "hey these are really salty" Now I don't know if all these things are related, but if there's one thing i'm sure of - it's that these are pretty salty.

review/text: I love the lime and chili almonds from blue diamond and they are a great snack if you are on a low carb diet. In addition buying the 3-pack of 16oz bags at amazon is a great deal considering that the 6oz can usually costs $3.79 at my grocery store. At first I thought "When am I ever going to finish 3x 16oz bags of almonds" but that's no problem at all. I even have to trick myself and put just a few in a bowl so I won't eat half the bag on one evening. I am addicted to lime and chili almonds and I am O.K. with it. I hope you will enjoy them too.

review/text: We discovered these Blue Diamond almond snacks while on vacation a couple of months ago.  We loved them!  Our favorites are the Lime and Chili as well as the Salt and Vinegar.  They are very tasty as well as healthy.  When we got home, we purchased them from Amazon.  We bought the 1.5 ounce snack bags.  They are perfect for lunches or travel snacks.  They also help with portion control!<br />By purchasing them in bulk from Amazon, we are able to get them for $1 or less per bag.  When we purchased them from a convenience store on our vacation we paid $2+ per bag.  It's a great savings to buy them here.

review/summary: A good flavor but not bold in comparison to some of the other flavors and more salt!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word "Bold" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a "Bold" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!

Primarily because I was looking for a butter-cookie taste (like Italian butter cookies or shortbread) but these do NOT taste like butter cookies. They taste almost exactly like Nila Wafers. This isn't bad, of course, but not what I wanted. Each package contains one row of fairly large cookies the size of your palm. I will say that the texture is very nice and crumbly-- the best part.

review/summary: Hi-Tor Neo Diet for Dogs -- Dry food
review/text: This is another great product in the Hi-Tor line.  Please see my review for the Neo canned diet for a lengthier review -- it all applies to this Dry Neo food too.  My older dogs who have had kidney disease have had teeth pulled by the vet.  The Dry Neo diet has small chunks & is easy to eat.  All my dogs like the flavor & have not refused the food - ever.  Because the chunks are small, they are easy to moisten with water for the dogs who need to *gum* their meals. I have to take a city bus to get to my vet now.  Ordering my Hi-Tor foods thru Amazon & having it come to my door has been a God send.  It is less expensive than what I get from the vet, I can buy it whenever I want, & it comes right to my door!!  Hi-Tor has done a great job for years supplying pet owners with Special Diets.  I have told all my friends about them & heartily recommend them.

review/summary: Great Dog food for dog's with kidney disease
review/text: My dog was recently diagnosed with kidney disease and the vet recommended the k/d diet.  I bought a 5lb bag at the vet's office for $32.00 of Hill's Prescription K/D dry dog food.  The vet told me that there were different brands and I'd have to experiment to find out which one my dog would like.  Not knowing that I would need a prescription for such dog food I went home without a prescription.<br /><br />My dog seemed to like the food - so knowing that a 5lb bag wouldn't last long I went in search of this special dog food. I went from store to store trying to find the k/d diet dog food.  I quickly found out I would need a prescription - of which the vet had to mail to me.  Even with the prescription you can only buy this special dog food from a vet's office.  Well for me - that's totally inconvenient.  My vet's office is a 1/2 hour drive away and with my work schedule and kids - it's not always convenient to drive for an hour just to get dog food.<br /><br />At one store I found the Hi-Tor Neo Diet food which could be bought without a prescription.  The clerk there was exetremely knowledgable and helpful.  She told me that the Hi-Tor Neo Dog food was actually better than the Hill's Prescription k/d.  I thought I  would try it since the 10lb bag was $24.99.  My dog loved it!  The clerk told me that they might not carry this brand for much longer so I went on the internet and found that Amazon carries this product. Even with shipping I'll be saving more than half of what I would spend at the vet's for a 10lb bag - not to mention the cost of gas and my time for a round trip.  I compared the labels and I do believe that Hi-Tor is actually better than the prescription brand.  In short, it's better for my dog, my dog likes it, I don't need a prescription and it's half the price with more convenience than the other dog food - what's not to love about it?

review/summary: Harney and Sonse Pomegranate Oolong Iced Tea
review/text: I received this order late (according to the tracking information I received).  Oddly enough, the shipping box arrived in perfect condition, BUT the actual tin that the tea came in was dented.  This may not mean much, except you pay quite the price for the tin, and I found the dented tin annoying.  I can only "assume" the company sent me a dented tin, based on the shipping box.

review/summary: Fairly disappointing
review/text: Summer is approaching and so is iced tea weather. I figure just because I want cold tea doesn't mean I have to reach for the Lipton bags. I am a fan of most Harney & Sons tea. When you open the tin the aroma of pomegranate is very strong and pleasant. I really enjoy just smelling the tin for a moment. Unfortunately, the love stops there. When brewed you get a very strong taste of the Ti Quan Yin oolong which I honestly don't know how it differs from other oolongs but they said the leaves are Ti Quan Yin so I'm rolling with it. I don't really taste the pomegrante and overall I feel it's a bit bitter. I tried it with agave as well and while it tamed the oolong a bit, I still didn't get that fruity note that I was looking for. I think I'm glad there are only 6 bags to go through on this. I may even try brewing 4 cups of hot water (they recommend 2) and steeping 2 bags in a 2-quart container. I'd rather "waste" a bag experimenting than to toss it aside and let it go stale.<br /><br />I think this one is probably a pass overall.<br /><br />I will say my tin was perfect, which is nice because it's pretty and reusable.

I took a chance with Newman's Own because another of their amazon products listed ingredients but did not indicate any allergens. And in my experience, many dark chocolate products are not processed with peanuts. Unfortunately, both Newman's Own products I ordered contain peanut warnings.<br /><br />Specifically for the peppermint cups: May contain Peanuts, Other Nuts, Milk Powder, Wheat, and Soy.<br /><br />My son couldn't enjoy them due to his peanut allergy, however, I found them to be very smooth and creamy.

review/summary: What's the difference?
review/text: So this company markets Samurai Rice Crackers and Oriental Rice Crackers.  I was under the mistaken impression the Samurai version would be spicy.  They're not.  I got 8 packages.  And none have been spicy.  There may be a subtle hint of heat.  But very subtle.<br /><br />I love rice crackers for whatever reason.  But I could've bought plain rice crackers locally for less.  This product is selling for close to 4 bucks a pound + shipping.  The bins at Whole Foods, Publix and Fresh Market have it for close to the same price + no shipping.  I also have purchased a better-tasting variety at Big Lots, 1 buck for about 12 oz.<br /><br />What I will say is that it appears these crackers are made for long-term storage.  They're in a thick bag that I can't open with just my bare hands.  They're really sealed up.  If you want to still have rice crackers during a hurricane or if that big earthquake hits, this is a great buy.

review/summary: Close, but no cigar...
review/text: Well we finally "bit the bullet" and ordered a burr coffee grinder from Amazon. We decided to get some of this coffee to start out our home grinding experience. Yesterday morning, the mailman arrived with our package. We have brewed 4 pots so far.<br /><br />First, no complaints about the caffeine. You can get quite a buzz on a couple of cups. And the beans are beautiful.<br /><br />It is not bitter or acidic - it's nice & smooth. I was disappointed with the the almost total lack of the wonderful aroma noted by other reviewers, though. It just seems to lack any outstanding flavor or character. Tastes similar to many better grocery store blends I have used in the past. Although my wife liked it better than I did, when asked if she would buy it again - she said: "Probably not."<br /><br />I'm not encouraged to try any of their other blends based on this experience. We will probably stick with Howe's, which is sold at our grocer. At least you can smell it before buying.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations were just too high.

review/text: The coffee is smooth and not acidic at all. It is, however, very oily, so much so that it clumps inside my grinder. Wish it had a richer taste. It helps to make it a little stronger than normal. It is not as wonderful as the San Francisco coffee that I remember from about 15 years ago on a trip, but I don't know who the roaster was. Guess you can drink to a memory, but not drink one itself. Oh, well. Only problem was that the delivery person left it down the block somewhere, and and the package got wet during a deluge. The packaging of the coffee itself was strong enough to withstand that. However, I couldn't open it and had to end up cutting off the resealable strip.

review/text: Recently cancelled Amazon subscription for a bag of these beans every month.  Last two shipments arrived with vacuum seal on the bag broken.  The shipping packaging suggests that this is a factory problem, not one with Amazon, but nevertheless the freshness of the beans is compromised.  The question of product tampering arises as well.  Can't claim any expert opinion on the quality of the beans, were good enough for me and attractively priced.  But the vacuum packing is for a good reason, and they've been shipping defective product to/for Amazon, I suspect.

review/summary: Be careful, this is a true french roast
review/text: I had initially written a poor review for this coffee.  However, I tried it again and I've developed a newfound appreciation for what they have here.<br /><br />It is rare to find a true french roast in a consumer branded coffee.  Most of what is called a french roast is really a full city roast (sometimes not even that).  The difference is stark.  However, I blame Starbucks for giving me a taste for a full french roasted bean.  And that is at least partially what you get here.  I'd estimate the blend at about 40% full french roast and the rest ranging from full city to full city roast +.  The net effect is a strong cup of coffee that, yes, will taste a bit scorched if you aren't accustomed to it.<br /><br />However, if you're looking for that same high octane kick that you get from Starbucks coffee then this may be the way to go.  However don't be surprised when you see very darkly roasted beans that are true full french roast.  Also, don't be surprised by a slightly higher caffeine kick!

They called me directly the very next morning.  They were professional and responsive in EVERY way (and friendly too!).  They handled my concern quickly and efficiently.  Even a bit later, when they realized a delay in my final resolution, they called me to advise there was a minor delay to resolution and wanted to make sure I knew they were handling my concern as promised.  Yes, they called me.  By the way, the concern was, in my opionion, relatively minor but I was treated like it was a major issue.  I will definiately continue to buy this coffee brand because of both 1) excellent coffee and 2) a company that backs their product with excellend customer service.  I do want to state that I might have been lucky in that I was contacted within about 12 hours of my concern (via phone, not email reply) and I don't want to sound like we could all expect that every time should a problem arise, but my experience was close to perfection and I would not be surprised if this level of service is the norm.
