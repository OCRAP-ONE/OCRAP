review/summary: Good night sleep
review/text: I purchased these tea bags in hope for a good night sleep. The first night I drank it, I slept great.  I have continued to drink this every night and I still sleep well but I find myself waking up in the middle of the night once in a while.  I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.  I recommended this to my family and co workers and they all love it.  I discovered this from Dr. Oz.  Hoping to continue to sleep well.

review/summary: Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me
review/text: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

review/text: I got this tea because it is supposed to help with PMS and supposedly helps "prepare" the uterus for conception. I figured it can't hurt, so why not? I think this tea is very light flavored. I usually put some honey in it and it goes down great.<br /><br />As for the rest, I've only been using it (3 times a day) for the past 7 days and haven't gone a full cycle yet, so I don't know if it really does work for PMS yet or not.

review/text: I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

review/text: My mother-in-law recommended this tea to me to help me naturally alleviate my menstrual cramps. I have to warn that the tea doesn't "kick in" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.<br /><br />It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it.

review/text: I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep. Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs. This tea has an obvious effect, though it takes about half an hour to kick in. I smells like crap, but if you mix it with mint tea, it isn't as noticeable. I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells.

review/summary: Fenugreek Seed Tea
review/text: I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/summary: Red Clover Tea
review/text: I purchased this tea because it is recommended for helping women's PMS symptoms and menopause symptoms.  I've only had one cup of it, so I can't say if it has helped my symptoms or not.  I have purchased other teas of this brand.  I would recommend their teas.  I wasn't crazy about the taste of the red clover, but that is just my personal opinion.  It's a little bitter but bearable.  Add some sugar and you're good to go.

review/summary: Interesting taste
review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

This tea has an interesting taste-not your typical tea but not bad. It tastes pretty good with a bit of honey added actually.

review/text: I have one cup a day and it really decreases my night sweats. I'm in amazement at how much it helps!<br /><br />The taste isn't great, but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviews have said. If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

I made one with fresh black eyed peas from our local farm, canned black beans, gypsy peppers, olive oil, red wine vinegar, corn and cilantro. It was delicious and the whole family couldn't stop snacking on it for 2 days! I also made it with the chicken broth, olive oil, red wine vinegar, and basil and tomatoes from our garden and that was a hit, too! I definitely recommend using 1 cup couscous with 1-1/4 cups chicken broth to cook the couscous. Then you can add your other goodies depending on what you have around the house/garden!

review/text: NUTELLA Hazlenut Spread is the second most scrumptious chocolate I have ever had.  Might as well tell the truth --  Belgian Chocolates, (often made with hazelnuts, just as Nutella is made), -- are the very, very best chocolates I have ever found....and ever hope to find!<br /><br />However, Belgian chocolates are also very, very, very, very (VERY!)expensive!  Belgian chocolates taste SO good because they are made by hand, from the VERY FRESHEST INGREDIENTS POSSIBLE!  Belgian chocolates usually come in a box.  They do not come in a glass or plastic bottle.  They are made into shapes....usually sea-shells or leaves....  Filled or solid, they are little easily-bitten-into, all-too-quickly-eaten, semi-hard morsels of yumminess!  But, again, very, very, very, very, VERY expensive semi-hard morsels of yumminess!<br /><br />Years ago, in NYC, there was an ad on TV for a company called "The Ritz Thrift Shop". First, one saw a rich,(blonde), woman taking her fur coat TO the Ritz Thrift Shop, (with accompanying lingering, luxurious, laid-back music).  Then a younger, hipper, and presumably poorer young lady, (a brunette), comes into the shop, happily buys<br />the fur, and goes on her way by descending into the subway!  A parallel can be drawn, using creative recipes with NUTELLA, to make<br />truly delicious confections and drinks!  Putting NUTELLA, chocolate malt powder, some milk, (and perhaps some extra sweetening), in a blender can produce the most delicious and aristocratic-tasting drink!  Substitute Nutella wherever possible, when the recipie calls for "chocolate", and you can't go wrong!  A 7-layer-cake, (or torte), made with Nutella is out of this world!  And the glass bottle keeps it staying the freshest possible!<br /><br />Like it's namesake, (Cinderella), Nutella can do just about everything expensive Belgian chocolates can do.....and maybe more....for far less money! Yummy!!!!!

review/summary: Hard to find item is better than at the Italian deli...
review/text: The only local Italian deli sold out of this for Christmas.  It was a real treat to find it online.  Two nice smaller (than I usually buy) fillets arrived, wrapped in plastic with a (totally melted) ice pack -- you shouldn't really need an ice pack for salted fish, should you?  It was packed in a lot of styrofoam peanuts which also really seems unnecessary for fish.  Maybe we could cut back on the shipping charges somehow?<br /><br />I cover mine in water and bring just to a boil then quickly drain.  It takes 3 times with the deli cod, but only 2 times with this.  It's a bit more delicate (due to smaller fish?).  I always break mine apart by hand and feel for bones, and just like the deli's, this had exactly one bone in it. It's like they want you to have to keep checking for bones.  There's always just one.<br /><br />Updated 7/8/2012:<br />On my second order of this, I got the dregs from the bottom of the case. It might weigh 1.5 pounds, but it's made up of tiny scraps of fish, all very thin. No full fillets. I'm very disappointed in the drop in quality and have dropped the stars rating to 4. BTW, they had 4 left when I bought 3 and now they still have 2! must have found more crumbs on the floor. Don't buy until they get a new shipment in would be my recommendation.<br /><br />The second batch did arrive without a plastic bag and ice, which was really never necessary. But it was poorly wrapped in white paper and the outer box was broken open at the corner. That wonderful (to me) smell of salted cod got me a lot of complaints at my mailbox company. These should be well-wrapped in white butcher's waxed paper, people, before shipping, and shipped in a box that is sealed, please.

review/text: I was quite pleasantly surprised with this product. I recently read the book, 'Cod'. It was an intriguing book and there were so many recipes that I thought I would try salted cod once to develop a full appreciation of the reading material. The product was so delicious that I think I will order from them periodically to make some of the amazing dishes I was able to explore with this purchase. I was surprised that a seafood ordered through the mail could be safe, and taste delicious but it was. Although I ordered 1.5 lbs, I'm pretty sure that it was at least 2 lbs of cod. Very generous. I made a variation of the basque fish stew 'bacalao ala vizcaina' and it was AMAZING.

review/summary: Delicious and nutritious
review/text: I tried these Froose gummy snacks at a gluten free convention and I was immediately hooked. I often snack on those Welch's fruit snacks that are fairly popular and found within lots of vending machines, but these gummies from Froose have so much more nutritional value and are made with wholesome organic ingredients. The snacks are still very sweet but they have more substance to them and you can taste the fruit juice and the lack of corn syrup. My only complaint is that the pouches are small and I'm always wanting more, but I guess portion control is a good thing. Give these gummies a shot and you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Nice Juice Cocktail of Blueberry + Grape + Apple
review/text: Growing up in New Jersey, the highest blueberry producer, we ate blueberries like candy when in season. They grow wild in some parts and are cultivated commercially in others. I really looked forward to this cocktail for the blueberry memories and the sale price. It's a good juice cocktail but the blueberry juice is overpowered by the grape juice. Don't get me wrong BOTH are healthy, good flavors I just expected more blueberry. It's 15% fruit juice NO High Fructose NO Corn Syrup, NO Artificial Flavors OR Colors OR Sweeteners. It does have Cane OR Beet sugar as it's 2nd ingredient. Which is fine, my body can handle the sugar better than artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />All that being said, I would only purchase this again IF it was at a super sale price.

review/summary: better taste to diabetic baking and other desserts.
review/text: Sugar Twin Brown has always been a favorite.  None of the stores I shop in would order it for me.  The last time I bought it was when Raley's was in Las Vegas. It is the only product that will make a decent BBQ sauce - using vinegar, tomato sauce, some hot sauce, & what ever else in on hand. Since I make all my own high fiber muffins - sugar twin works well to sweeten them.

review/text: Amazon is amazing.  I love using this brown sugar.  I like the fact that it has no calories, but mostly I like it because it pours, is easy to use and stores forever.  I was so grateful to find it on Amazon because my old supply from years ago was running out. I assumed that Twin had stoped making it and I would never see it again; that I would have to deal with clumping, hard brown sugar when, like so many other hard to find things, I decided to check Amazon and there it was!  What a delight to be stocked again for those last minuted needs to pour the flavor of brown sugar on hot cereal, acorn squash and the like.  Please excuse my lack of spelling and accept my praise of Amazon and this product!

I made a cake with this and it was awful, i used 1 cup in the recipe for the whole cake, which i have done before with splenda. I tried Sugar twin because it is a lot cheaper. The whole cake was in-edible, it had a very sweet chemical like taste. even after adding frosting it was awful and left my stomach in knots. I recommend splenda or ez sweetz.<br /><br />Cheers!

review/text: This product does not meet those amazon.com standards upon which I have developed a trust. It's a pity that my $25.49 has been wasted on an item I don't like and I can't return. I'm still questioning how I misread what little information is given.<br /><br />...........Product Features: Mini Candy Rocks made of candy. Soft chewy center with jelly beans like candy shell. Approximately 70 pcs per pound.<br /><br />Please notice that the Product Description block is blank. Hmmmm. Could the lack of a description be a deliberate mislead?<br /><br />The package arrived three days after my order was placed, and the only information on the plastic bag's little white paper sticker (1" X 2 1/4") is the bar code, and the words "Candy Rocks - Pebbles 5LB Bag."  On the bag's back side is a black, badly-faded ink stamp (this is a CLEAR plastic bag containing dark-mottled candy) that says "Nutrition Fact." However, whatever the rest of the "message" is illegible.<br /><br />Isn't there a federal law requiring a proper label showing ingredient listings and indicating a product is safe and wholesome? Yes, there is. "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for assuring that foods sold in the United States are safe, wholesome and properly labeled. This applies to foods produced domestically, as well as foods from foreign countries. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act are the Federal laws governing food products under FDA's jurisdiction." [...]<br /><br />Amazon.com needs more scrutiny with its associate vendors and clean up its act.

review/text: I love having tea with sugar, but am trying to reduce sugar in my diet.  I sometimes find by getting teas with berry/fruit flavors that I can either reduce or eliminate the need for sugar.  This tea is absolutely the best of my berry/fruit teas.  It's nice with just a touch of sugar, but 99% of the time I don't even bother because I don't miss it.  It has just a hint of sweetness, without any syrupy taste.  It has a full, deep, rich taste with a lovely aroma and no bitterness.  It's great hot (I usually seep for ~5 minutes, but longer is fine) and great over ice (~10+ minutes).  I purchased this tea, so I could drink it at work, but ended up keeping some at home, because I enjoyed it so much.  I would recommend this tea and plan to purchase it again.

review/text: This Impra Black Currant Tea is an excellent tea -- as compared to any -- and is gotten at an excellent cost -- an amazing deal for a huge stash of 600 bags [100 bags per box and six of those] at a very low cost per bag. Yet, I immediately loved the black currant enhancement of the good black tea of this variant. I can easily taste both the good black tea and the black currant to my great approval. I have tried it both hot and iced and it is very fine each way. It is all the better that black currant adds to the wellness of black tea as well as to the flavor and balance. Such a black currant infused black tea is not well known in North America but is a favorite of North Europe. Maybe that will change for the better via teas such as this one +++

You do smell a blackcurrant flavor when you open a new bag of tea, but it is all gone by the time you put the bag into a water. You won't taste a rich Ceylon black tea either.<br />The tea might sound good for the price but I don't know what to do now with all these flavorless bags in my pantry. And yes, I'm Russian and has been drinking tea all my life, so I really know how bad this "tea" tastes compared to other brands out there. Try Ahmad instead.
