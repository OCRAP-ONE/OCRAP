review/summary: Amazing how cats are addicted to these!
review/text: Ok I have 4 cats that will do anything for these treats. If they even think I'm going to pick up that bag they are all screaming and running in circles. My oldest has asthma and is on an inhaler, which involves putting a mask over her nose and mouth. She loves these treats so much that she will actually ask me to give her the inhaler so that she can get rewarded with these treats afterwards. I have never had them go so nutty over a treat. Any and all flavors are their favorites, just as long as it's Whiskas Temptations!

Now when I want hot apple cider I get to decide which flavor I'm in the mood for. I love the little pleasures in life.<br /><br />Hot Apple Pie flavor gave me an idea... For a hot desert add a couple extra ounces of water with the packet, then spoon a dollop of vanilla custard in. :)

review/summary: A solid raisin biscuit!
review/text: I was a huge fan of the Sunshine Raisin Biscuits which Keebler no longer makes. These biscuits feature a thin layer of raisin paste in a thin layer of cookie. Garibaldi now appears to be the only maker of raisin biscuits. These are not as good as Keebler's Sunshines, but if you are a raisin biscuit fan they are fine. They are a little drier and the biscuit is a little less sweet and there is a little less raisin paste. However, they are still a great way to satisfy your raisin biscuit craving. They are especially good when accompanied by tea--I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4VS5W">Kalahari Red Tea, Highlands Honey, Tea Bag, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> with them.

review/text: As someone wrote earlier, these are thinner, less sweet, and drier, but welcome all the same to those of us who miss our domestic raisin biscuits. This isn't to say that Garibaldis are stale or somehow inferior in any way, because they aren't. Be advised, however. Each package contains two biscuits about 2 5/8" wide by 7 1/2" long. At that size, and for this price, you may as well order a case; it's cheaper and you won't run out before you get your nostalgia fix. I'm going to order a case right now...

review/text: Born and raised in America, I had no idea what I was missing until living in Denmark and discovering wine gums.  Since returning to the states 10 years ago I have done my best to find the same brand that I would buy there.  The search continues but my first order of Gustaf's wine gums arrived today and I just may give up the search.  These are excellent wine gums:  tangy, tart, chewy--just about perfect.  Plus, they are noticeably larger than the wine gums I was used to in Europe.  If you like gummi candy it doesn't get any better than this.  Sorry gummi bears, but it's true.

review/text: I ordered the wine gummies because I remembered loving them as a child, and their intense flavor seemed sealed in my tastebud memory... The shipment included three huge bags of the candy (too few of the black/purple and red ones, IMO--seriously disproportioned toward the white and yellow), and the candy is good. The flavor is almost as I remember--somehow I thikn that childhood gave the candy an extra 'oomph' which this experience now, in adulthood did not share... But, these are still very good gummies, excellent consistency--not too sticky, not too soft. I've shared some (it is a LOT of candy) with others, who loved them as well. I recommend this purchase if you love gummies and want a change from the boring bears...

review/text: I have always enjoyed wine gums. I am from Canada where they are widely available and I always brought home a few kilos of Maynards to last me through the time to my next visit. On a whim, I searched Amazon and noted these well-rated wine gums and decided to give them a try. They are excellent! Different in flavor and texture than Maynard's but I find them better. The flavors are more distinct and intense. I am so thrilled! I hope Amazon keeps these on the stock list for a long time. As other have mentioned, there is no alcohol in these candies. There is no fat either, and comparatively low sugar levels. Enjoy them, if you have been looking for wine gums, these are it, and a great buy to boot!!!

review/summary: Yummy Gummy!!
review/text: The Cons:  I received three bags of wine gums in a plain brown cardboard box. None of the packaging had any identifying labels--not the manufacturer, not the ingredients, nothing. Just three clear cellophane bags. One of the bags had broken open, and a good third of the gummies were loose in the box. Undaunted, I sampled some of the spilled candy and Did Not Die.<br /><br />The Pros:  These have to be the absolute best gummies I have ever tasted, bar none. They definitely resemble the candies in the Amazon picture, so I assume they ARE the Gustaf's brand. The flavors are delicious and unique, unlike many of the more kid-centric candies on the market. They are not for the weak of teeth, however, possessing a very persistent but satisfying chewiness. I love all of the flavors, although I cannot necessarily identify them. (Pear! There's definitely pear!)<br /><br />The Verdict:  I'd give these five stars were it not for the packaging issues. If you're willing to take your life in your hands by eating questionably identifiable gummies, these are definitely worth the money. I say, go for it!

review/summary: Can't beat the price!
review/text: The texture and chewiness of these Winegums is just like the real deal.  They're not too soft like many of the imitation Winegums tend to be, so in that aspect, they're close to perfect.  However, the flavor is not the same, that's why I can't give them 5 stars.  These simply don't taste as good as the Maynard's, Bassett's, or some of the other kinds that can be found at European candy stores.<br /><br />The price on these is so incredibly fair that I had to give them 4 stars.  Also, once you've eaten a few of them and you overcome the initial expectations, the flavor actually begins to improve and they can be enjoyed quite vividly.  I love eating these while studying for my exams.<br /><br />I recommend them as a good alternative for the thrifty Winegums lover who is stuck in the USA and doesn't want to pay $50 on shipping to get the originals from Europe.

review/text: These wine gums are basically another variety of gummi candy.  These have good consistancy (not too soft) and different flavors (black currant, pineapple, raspberry, lemon etc.).  Family really enjoyed these.  However, my favorite gummis are still the Haribo Super Cola.

review/text: Let's just say that these have spoiled me and made me not want any other gummies. They just do not compare! The flavors and texture are so much better than typical gummy candies, and the size of each piece is perfect. They are not sticky, even when in warm temperatures. My favorites are the purple and the white/clear ones, but all of them are really good. Anyone with whom I've shared these wine gums immediately love them, too. I have to limit myself to a few at a time, because they are so delicious and so addictive! If you are a fan of gummy candy, you should try these. You will not regret spending the money for this treat.

review/text: Funny, how one of the previous reviews is about an American who learned to eat wine gums while living in Denmark. Well, I was born and raised in Denmark and only moved to the US a little over a year ago. Since then, I have tried various wine gums I have picked up in the super market, and well, it is just not the same. But I now tried Gustaf's wine gums and they are wonderful! Compared to the well known Bassets wine gums, I think Gustafs wine gums have much more flavor. They also seem a little softer and although I prefer the slightly harder Bassets, the advantage is that they won't make your jaws hurt.

review/summary: The Best Gums anywhere....
review/text: ...being a "gummy" expert, Gustaf's Wine Gums are the best!  They have a unique texture because they are made with a totally different base than other gummies- they are starch based rather than the American gelatin based product.  The flavor is also very different and appeals to the adult taste - they really do have the hint of wine flavor not the common fruit sweetness.  Heads and shoulders better than Maynard's - my old standby!  Denmark you have surpassed all other similar European and American products.  I have had them on auto-deliver for several years and they are definitely worth the price!!!

Wine gums were always my favorite - especially Maynards. I pick some up each time I go visit and I have been purchasing Maynards online. Maynards are expensive but I have tried less expensive brands but they are never as good....TILL NOW....I agree with the other reviews. THESE WINE GUMS ARE EXCELLENT. I could not believe the reviewers indicating that these are better than Maynards but I do now. Couldn't be happier. Much better price and great flavor......YAY

They aren't exactly the same, so not as good, but they are excellent in their own right. I highly recommend these to anyone who is a Wine Gums fan. You will not be disappointed.

review/text: and to a lesser extent the white ones.  The orange, red, green, and yellow are some of the best wine gum flavors I have eaten.  But the purple ones are supposed to be that strong almost border-line "tastes so bad its good can I have another" black currant flavor.  The Gutaf's ones are simply sweet with no discernable flavor.  So sad because one feels that a company that could do such an outstanding job with the other flavors, could do so much better. One caveat:  the white ones are, also, without discernable flavor, however, no respectable wine gum eater really expects too much of them, anyway.  Yes, it is the purple ones that will break your heart.<br /><br />And should you, actually, like the purple and white ones, I have three bags of rejects I could fish out of the trash for you.

review/summary: What it is....
review/text: As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying "fresh" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag. You want good? Empty out your bank account and buy fresh.

review/summary: Wonderful tea
review/text: Knowing I love hot tea in the wintertime, a friend gave this to me as a Christmas gift last year.  There are 20 sachets of tea (making one small pot each) and I used 18 of them last season.  Last night I was ready for some nesting so got out a good book and made a pot of this.  I was reminded how much I like it and am going to be looking to buy more since I now have one left.<br /><br />It's a white tea which I like to drink in the evening after dinner due to its low level of caffeine.  This is a very nice tea to drink alone or with some simple cookies, such as ginger tea cookies.  I don't think I would like it with food since the flavors stand alone and would interfere with the meal.  A nice blend of spices and the vanilla tone is what stands out to me, but not overwhelming.<br /><br />A great gift for someone, including yourself.  Beautiful packaging makes it easy to give to others as well.

review/summary: Don't drink it on an empty stomach
review/text: I love white tea, I adore Harney and Sons. However this tea made me feel a little funky. Maybe it was the cardammon on an empty stomach, but I felt a little sick. This just was not the tea for me. I didn't like it.<br /><br />Harney and Sons sachets are realy loose tea in the convenience of a tea bag. Each tea bag can brew two cups of tea. Instructions for brewing each individual tea is on the tin.

review/summary: great white!
review/text: THis is a great tasting white holiday tea. Keep in mind white tea doesn't steep well for a long time...1 or two minutes and then it gets bitter.  It's got a vanilla/almond taste and is light and flavorful.  Perfect for the holidays and winter nights.

review/summary: Very Bland
review/text: I bought this tea becaue the brand I bought on Amazon last time was unavailable.  I love mate, though I've gotten used to the flavor infused leaves.  This tea is not minty AT ALL.  I usually drink celestial seasons peppermint tea (when I'm not drinking mate), and this pales in comparison.  It's a very boring flavor.  I might add a celestial seasonings bag to my next teapot of this...

review/summary: quality chocolate in holiday wrappers
review/text: Madelaine chocolates are good quality.  They have a wonderful taste, and texture and won't give you the bellyache that some other "holiday" or "special occasion" chocolates do.  Whether you are buying an Easter bunny or any of the specially wrapped chocolates, they'll be fresh and well made with good ingredients.  I'm buying these because I couldn't find any individually wrapped quality Halloween chocolate and I figure this orange and black wrapper is close enough.  I'm so glad I found something acceptable made by a dependable and even somewhat fancy brand!

review/summary: Keeps its flavor and consistency
review/text: I can't believe I'm bothering to write a review for, of all things, chewing gum.  I've been bothered lately after having bought a variety of different gum products from most of the selection that we all see on the checkout line among the other impulse items.  I've been bothered because of all these fabulous new flavors that have become available over the last few years, pretty much all of them lose their flavor within minutes, and in most cases either become too hard before very long to continue chewing even if you're inclined to continue chewing the flavorless mass after you've sucked all of the taste from it.  At least one brand went the other way and progressively disintegrated as I chewed it, leaving me feeling as if I was chewing a ball of flour.<br /><br />I had tried the 5 series a while back, and I'm really not remembering whether what I'm about to say was true of the other flavors.  The Solstice really grabbed me just now because it's the first "5" gum I've bought after having gone through so many of the competing products, and I've been sitting here in my meager office cubicle chewing this piece of Solstice for some time now and am impressed at how much of the flavor is still intact and how soft yet cohesive it continues to be.  That is a truly refreshing contrast to these other overpriced short-lasting gum products in the flashy eye-grabbing packaging.  Now I'm compelled to try the other flavors again, because while I do enjoy the weird warm-cool mint flavor of Solstice, I'm more of a fruity gum type of guy.  Could the citrus or berry flavored "5" be so long-lived and texture retaining?  I'm hoping so.  Good job, Wrigley.  Also, kudos to the entire chewing gum industry for making most of the gum products sugar free.  We no longer have to compromise and get that ONE crappy flavor in sugar free while foregoing the really awesome but sugary flavors.

review/text: I agree, it seems silly to be reviewing a pack of gum, but we really like this gum. I was sitting here at my desk happily chomping when I wondered if anyone else had discovered it. First off, the pieces seem huge, my daughter and I easily split this last piece and I don't even notice that it's a half. The flavor is nice, but the kicker is that it lasts as long as you can possibly chew a piece of gum, no kidding. Try it!

review/text: I usually order the Organic Nature Select Applesauce from Gerber, however I thought that this is the same product, only DHA enhanced.  The DHA is derived from Tuna Oil which is not so bad, however it also contains Gelatin, derived from pork, not vegetables!.  The product ingredients above does not state that, and is very misleading.  I didn't notice this until my 3 year old ate 3 containers of it!

review/summary: Good product, best price...
review/text: We've been eating these pears for over 2.5 years at least twice a day.  Gerber's organic variety is the cheapest price per oz I've found for an "organic pear-only" baby food.  Amazon's price (without Prime) is slightly less than our local grocery store when purchased at regular price.  This is the best price I've found outside special sales.  Contrary to the other review, almost all baby food is "cooked" via some method, usually steaming - even if homeade - which I did for a long time before switching to packaged versions for convenience and inaccessibility to organic produce.  The homeade raw puree works better for her child, but this product has been great for us.  It's been solving our constipation issues for over two years, and it works wonderfully!

review/summary: Gerber's fruits are cooked
review/text: I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?

review/text: When you get this home and read the ingredients list, you will see: This product has "organic" stamped all over it, but when you read the ingredients list, it includes tuna oil that is not organic. I called the company, and they said the product "does not have harmful levels of mercury."  I prefer my bananas with NO mercury, thanks. They include tuna oil to provide a source of DHA, but there are several baby products that have plant-based sources of DHA. We are vegetarian, and I don't want to feed fish oil to my baby. I recommend other brands like Earth's Best which seem to be more careful about their ingredients. I'm sure this is fine for people who are feeding tuna fish to their babies anyway, but we don't plan to give ours tuna fish.

review/text: I gave my dog one of these "calming" bones during a thunderstorm.  She wasn't too interested in chewing it (she was too nervous) so it didn't achieve the desired effect.  The next morning, she ate it, but not as quickly as she would have eaten it if it were one of her favorite edible chews.  I think the lavender and/or chamomille flavors don't appeal to her, since she's used to getting bacon or beef flavored edible chews.  These bones are comparable to Nylabone Healthy Edibles, which my dog loves.

review/summary: Excellent Taste, But Gluey Consistency...
review/text: Because I found Bonne Maman Cherry Preserves incredibly good, I had no hesitation when it came to purchasing the strawberry.  I can only say I am disappointed by the product and hope my experience may be an aberration.<br /><br />Unlike most of the commercially available products, the flavor of these preserves is excellent.  It is natural and does not taste as if the flavor was enhanced during processing.  However, the consistency of the preserves reminds me of rubber cement - it is gluey and does not spread easily.  Fortunately, I use a lot of preserves on each bagel piece, so this gave me an excuse to pile it on.  I thought it might be that the jar I purchased was getting toward the end of its shelf life, but it still had 15 months until the pull date.  Further, the jar I opened first had whole strawberries through it, rather than smaller pieces.  While this may be considered desirable, I like to be able to apread the preserves and not just glop on chunks of berry.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Cherry Preserves immensely, but I think there are all-natural strawberry preserve products on the market that are better than Bonne Maman Strawberry Preserves.  In fact, one of the big box stores has its own organic strawberry preserves available in a quart jar; these have the same outstanding flavor of the Bonne Maman, but are not rubbery and the strawberries have been crushed rather than processed as whole berries.  I believe the cost is about $7 for that product.
