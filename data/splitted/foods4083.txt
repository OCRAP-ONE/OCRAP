review/summary: This food changed my dog.
review/text: There are already enough stellar reviews for this food, but I want to just briefly add to the pile.<br /><br />Our golden retriever was on Puppy Chow -> Dog Chow for all of her 5 years. I know, I know... Dog Chow is not the Rolls Royce of dog foods, but we got a good deal on it and she did fine with it for years. But we noticed in the last few months she was getting lazy and sluggish, and listening poorly. But the worst part was the stomach issues. Throwing up inside after eating, 2-3 times a week? Not cool - especially when it happens while visiting your mother-in-law who just her her carpet replaced. Whoops.<br /><br />After researching on our own, we decided to invest in our dog: she adds so much to our family, so it's only right for us to help her out. We switched to Nature's Variety after comparing the reviews to other foods in this price range. We had it narrowed to NV and Buffalo Blue, and just pulled the trigger on NV here on Amazon. (By the way, while it's ridiculous to see your UPS guy haul dog food to your doorstep - Amazon's price is unbeatable when you subscribe.)<br /><br />We're halfway into the second bag, and our dog just keeps on getting more vibrant, entertaining, playful (but not crazy), and attentive. This is the best thing we've ever done for our dog. I don't know if other foods in this "class" would have had the same effect, but you won't see us switching anytime soon.

review/summary: Clay?  What? It's legit, really :)
review/text: So the crazy clay stuff listed on the bag really is a difference that makes a difference. And it's not a miniscule amount for show, it's high up on the list (anything listed after the fat source in a bag of dry food is not a significant food source, though nutrients still of course need only be present in tiny amounts). Prairie is a really good all rounder food. I like the variety, the balance of the protein and fat for the average companion dog,  and the simple list of ingredients. I'd only love to see a probiotic source. They used to include inulin, curious why they dropped it. This was my base diet for my sedentary, retired dogs, for a few years. Great to see this on Amazon!

review/summary: Dog Went on Hunger Strike
review/text: We bought this for our lab/ golden retriever mix and introduced the food to her by mixing it with her other food.  She had no trouble with loose stools or rejection of the food.  Once she was on Prairie for a full month without it being mixed with her old food, she suddenly stopped eating. We were growing very concerned about her because I could tell she was hungry and lacking energy. Our veterinarian suggested we try mixing some wet food with it to entice her.  We did, her appetite returned immediately, and she immediately returned to her old happy self. It's important to note that if any of the food is not covered in the gravy/ ground meat mixture from the canned food she refuses to eat those bits.  The dog just hates this food, and this is a dog who will eat ANYTHING. Back to Blue Buffalo. Too bad, because I really liked the subscribe and save feature for this kind of food.

review/text: We were having issues with our 13 year old collie and new puppy wanting to eat the other's food...trying to separate them caused other issues so we looked into finding dog food that would work for both and the Nature's Variety Brand came up several times from our vet, groomer, etc...There was no adjustment period and both did very well with the switch. It is wonderful now to see them side by side eating...The best part is that you can order online and have it delivered right to your door step.

review/summary: Better price on Amazon than I can get locally!
review/text: This dog food is one of the better ones available, but it can be pretty pricey, WHEN I can find it!  Our dog has been raised on Nature's Variety but when I was out of work, I was looking for cheaper alternatives since it's so expensive.  I really hated to do this, since it's so healthy for him and he isn't very receptive to change. I was relieved to find it on Amazon and love the idea of the subscription...especially with the discount!  Thanks to the subscription pricing I was able to swing it. Love having it delivered, don't have to haul it to and from the car and it arrives safely at my door, boxed to prevent damage to the bag.

review/summary: No more diarrhea!
review/text: We have been trying one brand of dry food after another to no avail.  The switching process, although not difficult, is still a pain.  One of our two dogs had boughts of diarrhea about every 3 - 5 days and since having made the switch to Nature's Variety Praire Chicken Meal & Brown Rice, I have not had to medicate him as he hasn't had any diarrhea in at least two weeks.  The last food he was on was a popular warehouse brand.  This is allergy season and the scratching and licking were bothering both dogs (and us!) but while one is still at it (I think he's just so used to doing it) the other one has stopped.  I tried this food because at the time all the ratings were five stars.  It is a five star food and I would highly recommend giving it a try.  I did subscribe to a monthly delivery and although the box didn't survive so well, the product was intact in its secure bag.

review/summary: Good food
review/text: I started my Lab on this after realizing that the food he was eating was mostly corn and "by-product."  He loves it.  He weighs about 115 lbs., but should weigh around 100, so he gets 1/2 cup of food morning and night with a cup of frozen green beans.  The food is more dense, so when paired with the green beans, it definitely keeps him fuller- longer.

We went straight from pedigree to Nature's Variety with no problems.  She actually eats less and poops less.  Her attitude has changed too, shes a six year old puppy now.  I am going to subscribe to several different flavors alternating monthes.  Shes 100 ponds and a 30 pound bag will last around a month.

review/summary: Even the picky eaters love this one!
review/text: On the recommendation of a breeder friend, we decided to try out a new kibble for our small pack of assorted fur babes. My mother has two Pomeranians (one of which is *extremely* picky, even with fresh "people" food), I have one Pom, one Peke mix and a German Shepherd mix. Since we were all together over the holidays we decided to give this food a try to see how they all liked it. I was impressed with the nutritional content, but that doesn't always translate to taste or appealing to our dogs. From the very first bowl, they were all interested - even my mother's super picky eater. I highly recommend this food, especially for picky eaters. We haven't been using it long enough to determine it's long term effects on the health of our dogs, but have noticed smaller stools, less gas/tummy upset and happier, more playful pooches!

review/summary: Loves
review/text: My husband and I were looking for a better quality dog food.  Mainly because our dogs REALLY stank after coming in from outside and randomly smelled like corn/fritoes.  I researched it a little and found it might have to do with the dog food we were feeding them.  We gave this to them (we have a hound shephard mix and pug) and the bigger one loved it!  She was hoarding the food and trying to make sure the other one didn't get any-she is a pretty picky dog.  The pug liked it too, but he will eat anything.  I feel as if the smell has gotten a lot better-not 100%, but they are dogs and dogs will smell.  I am rating this 5 stars because my dogs love it so much, it is a pretty good deal (we were feeding them Beneful from Costco which was bout 14 dollars cheaper), good size morsels, and I like the ingredients.

review/summary: Works for our dog
review/text: We have a 9 month old Australian shepherd rescue who's been eating this food since we adopted her at age 3 months. I chose it randomly from the local pet store because the packaging claims it can be used in rotation with other dog foods.  Since I had also heard that Aussies have sensitive digestive systems I thought it would be good for us since we didn't know what she ate prior and I anticipated possibly having to sample a few different types of food. She loves it.  She eats it so fast I've considered trying a strategy to slow down her eating (such as one of the toys that the dog food comes out of more slowly).  Her digestion patterns seem pretty good on this food so I have no complaints.  Pricing is comparable here to the local premium pet supply store.

review/summary: Vague Item description
review/text: The Nature's Variety Dry Dog food has a great kibble size and comes in a very durable bag for storage, but the product list on Amazon's website neglected to list the entire contents of ingredients contained in the dog food. My dog has several food allergies,soy and certain grains, peas, and EGGS. The ingredient list appeared to cover what I was looking for, or the lack thereof, and so I ordered a bag. I was extremely surprised when I started seeing a rash on my dog, and began searching for the cause. Since he was eating the Nature's Variety, the only new item in his diet, I got the bag and read the list of ingredients, and was shocked to see several kinds of eggs listed! Eggs were NOT listed in the ingredients nor in the item description. So, needless to say, I will not be buying anymore Nature's Variety for my dog.

review/text: You really do get what you pay for most of the time when it comes to pet foods.  There are foods out there that are better than this one, but this one is a good value when you look at the lbs and the ingredient list.  High quality ingredients in small kibbles mean that I can feed less food and that it turn means less waste!  My dogs have been on this food for 6 years and I've never once felt like they need to be on something different.  We rotate flavors (lamb, chicken, beef, etc) if the store is out of stock or Amazon's price isn't suiting me.  I've never had a hard time getting them to eat it and they look absolutely amazing.  Very pleased with this company and with this food!  Only thing is that I wish they would bring back the zippered 30 lb bags, I had to buy a rolling bin and I still don't feel like this food is very fresh.

review/summary: It's better, but not perfect
review/text: Both of our dogs are adopted dogs.  One was at a shelter being fed raw meat when we got her and the other was in a foster home being fed Nutro.  We wanted a food that would be easy to transition to for both of them.  After a ton of debate, we landed on Prairie because it's supposed to be better for the dog.<br /><br />I justify the healthy food for dog thing by asking myself if I would eat McDonalds or Burger King every day and I personally would not, so why would I make my dogs eat the cheaper dog food that filled with all kinds of stuff that's not actually food?<br /><br />Both dogs transitioned to Prairie extremely well.  But after a few months, one of them started developing horrible gas (*farting*).  So we immediately thought it was the food.  We decided to switch their food and give them Rachael Ray's dog food.  The transition to that went fairly smooth as well.  However, after a few months of that we couldn't find it anywhere (not sure if they stopped making it).  So we switched again, this time to Nutro.  Not only did Nutro give them horrible gas, but their coats were less soft and they seemed to have almost no energy.  After trying a few other brands over the years, we ended up back at Prairie and are sticking with it (at least for now).  The dogs just seem to have more energy and better fur (even if they do still have gas). So I'd recommend trying it.<br /><br />We found it to be about $20 cheaper on amazon for a 30lb bag than at the local pet store.

Of course, I live in New England and it is not very ht here. I would be a bit more concerned if I lived in a warmer climate.

Most of the seafood (fish/squid in particular) YOU buy for your own consumption at the grocery store is usually from Thailand!! Your concerns stem from product coming from China (which is not "Asia" or "Thailand" FYI). Natural Value has high standards of processing/manufacturing as listed on their website and they stand behind it. I trust them 100%.<br /><br />To "happyhalloween" - well yes, it is unfortunate to pay that much for shipping - but what exactly does the shipping cost from Amazon have to do with the product itself?? Nothing. Perhaps next time you would be better suited to actually base your rating on the quality of the food instead of leaving a one-star review that has nothing to do with the product in question.<br /><br />Now - onto my review - I have been buying Natural Value tuna n' toppings for my cats for about five years now. This is a very healthy and affordable cat food! Even after all this time - my cats still gulp it down no questions asked - they actually prefer this over anything. I have bought just about every type of  high-end cat food out there. My cats love this food above all of them.<br /><br />The ingredients are self-explanatory - it's free of rice, grains, "meals", and all those other fillers put in just about every other big name cat food.<br /><br />When you open the can - it looks just like what it is supposed to be - tuna meat with an additional "topping". The can is filled to the brim with chunks of red meat tuna with no watery liquids (the jelly used to hold the meat together is very effective). It's solid meat, solid food and its definitely affordable for all consumers.<br /><br />You know you are buying the right food for your cats when you are the only one you know who doesn't have a "fat" cat. All of my felines have maintained a healthy weight and a soft, shiny coat while eating this food. I also never find myself complaining about finicky eaters when I have a supply of Natural Value in my kitchen.<br /><br />Do yourself and your cat a favor and try this food instead of the grocery store junk. Natural Value has a great balance of nutritional additives and a good supply of taurine (a very important part of a cats diet). I cannot recommend this food enough! I am very thankful I discovered it in my local corner store (of all places) way back when.<br /><br />Also - the price here on Amazon is fantastic - I just picked up two cases with free shipping (50 cans) for under $30.00!

review/summary: Great choice
review/text: Cat loves the food. You feel good about paying less and getting a product with real meat listed as the first ingredients.  Also the can is really easy to clean out because it doesn't have sticky fillers like Science Diet does.  The only thing is Cat seems to be hungry all the time, meowing for food often.  I'm not sure if it's because it is less filling than other foods or if he's just obsessed with it.

review/summary: Amazing food!
review/text: Feeding 2 cats twice a day is made so simple with this bigger can.  I just give each half!  I give them Tiki Cat, which they adore, but I wanted to try this one because of the good deal.  I was hesitant because of the menedione sodium bisulfate listed in the product description, which isn't in any of the pate forms of this brand.  I took a risk and am glad I did...there is no MSB in the case I got and I have to say, it looks just like Tiki!  Only difference is, it cost me 27 cents a serving versus 83 cents.  I ordered more!

review/summary: Cats LOVE but tuna is wild caught from Thailand
review/text: Amazon was out of the chicken variety that our cats love. I decided to order the Tuna blend even though I don't like to feed my cats too much fish. They love this and will gobble it up like its their last meal, and it doesn't have a strong fish odor which is surprising for a food made from tuna... but on the box it is marked 'Wild Caught! Product of Thailand'. I'm wary of any foods from Asia (and most non-USA foods for that matter) except Japan, where the manufacturing standards are even higher than the US, after the horror of the Chinese pet food ingredients that killed all of those cats and dogs. Still, the food seems good quality, Natural Value is a respectable company committed to organic and healthy products, and when Amazon has it in stock, the price with free shipping is a bargain.

review/summary: DO NOT BUY
review/text: If you are buying these as a chocolate flavored treats with a fringe benefit of  contributing to oral health, look elsewhere! If you are primarily interested in using xylitol sweetened candy as a preventative measure to use against cavities and gum disease, you might find these barely satisfactory. The bottom line is that these, allegedly, chocolate flavored lollipops have hardly a hint of flavor AT ALL and if it weren't for the dark brown color that primes the mind to expect a chocolate flavor, I doubt whether one could even discern that that they are supposed to BE chocolate. I ordered from Dr. John's website directly and I have decided to keep them in spite of my negative opinion because of the benefits of xylitol and I will just eat these everyday as if i were taking medication. I may order again but it certainly won't be the chocolate.

review/text: I just picked this up at my local grocery store because it was the only organic brown rice they had and I was pleasantly surprised! It cooks really well, not sticky at all (I use a bit of coconut oil and cook it in organic vegetable broth.) Tastes great! I am not typically a brown rice lover but this kind was really good. My kids and husband ate it and asked for seconds as well. Was delighted to see it on Amazon and for such a great price with subscribe and save so I just stocked up!

review/summary: Great spice to use for tagine cooking!
review/text: I've used Shawarma for Meat to cook osso buco (cross cut veal shank) and lambs on my tagine.  It comes out great every time!  Along with this spice, I found it necessary to add sea salt and ground pepper to the meat before cooking it on low heat for 1.5 hrs.  The meat comes out fork-tender.  Great on white or brown rice.  The beauty of tagine cooking is that you can bring the dish from stovetop to the dinner table.  Very simple...and delicious.<br /><br />The same can be said of Shawarma for Chicken.  I normally don't like to buy too many spices.  Shawarma for Chichen and Shawarma for Meat both have very diffrent taste.  I end up using these spices quite often on my tagine.  Dump all the meat, shallots, onions, olives and lemon juice into the tagine and wait for 1-1.5 hrs (scraping the bottom of the dish every now and then so it doesn't burn.)  Combined with veggie (sautee or steamed) and rice and you got one hearty meal.  My family was quite impressed!

review/text: I had tried the FiberGourmet pasta a couple years ago and thought it was okay, but they only had the fettuccine back then. I just tried these this week and I really like this shape. This pasta holds up well, firmly, even if you cook it past the recommended time (I find that unlike regular pasta, which to get al dente the way I like, I need to cook LESS than package instructuions, this pasta needs more time or tastes undercooked). I made a really good low-fat, high-fiber mac n cheese with this  using light cheddar, low fat american cheese, skim milk, and Smart Balance and a teensy bit of onion powder. Mmm.<br /><br />I like the packaging now, too, and the newer pasta shapes are much more convenient and useful for me than the old fettuccine nests I originally tried.<br /><br />Recommended if you need to up your fiber, cut your carbs but keep eating pasta, or just wanna cut calories.

review/text: I've been having terrible cravings for Ginger and you wouldn't believe how difficult it is to find decent 'Crystalized Ginger' 'round these parts.  The candied ginger I've found at the local grocery store could have been plain ol' sugar cubes for all it's worth.  You couldn't taste the ginger and the texture... just horrible.  This ginger however is AMAZING!  Great sweetness with a good balance of 'spiciness' thrown in.  You can definately taste the ginger in these sugared goodies!<br /><br />That said, I've recently ordered a bunch of Ginger products from a company called 'The Ginger People' (I've tried their 'Ginger Chews' which are available locally and they are very tasty).  I'm hoping that their ginger products have even more of a kick because it's the sweet 'spiciness' that I truly crave.  But for the time being, it is safe to say that this is the BEST Crystallized Ginger I have had to date.

review/summary: Did I get a bad batch?
review/text: I adore ginger in every form.  Buoyed by the glowing reviews, I ordered three pounds.  Unfortunately, it was not at all as described.  The first bite was bland and too sugary; the after-taste almost medicinal.  I couldn't detect any spicy ginger flavor.  I tried a couple more pieces and found them thoroughly unpleasant.  The store owner was great, however.  I returned the two unopened bags and he/she issued a full refund.  I threw the third bag away.

review/summary: Not bad at all, pretty tasty in fact
review/text: This ginger candy does not have as much of a "bite" as some brands of (more expensive) ginger candy I have previously enjoyed and is a bit sweeter than I would prefer. That being said, it is a nice bag of ginger, lots of flavor, tastes very fresh. I am pleased with the price, shipping, amount and flavor so this is a keeper. I will order from this place again and get another bag of this crystallized ginger yummy-ness.

review/summary: Excellent Ginger
review/text: Thai Crystalized Ginger is supposed to be the best in the world, so I am told by a food technologist.  Australian is supposed to be the second best.  I am not so sure that Thai Ginger would be the best after the recent tidal wave, if there is much difference at all.  Those are the two premier crystalized gingers of the world<br /><br />Regardless, this is about all you could ask for in great ginger.  This ginger is moist and tender, unlike some dry and stringy ginger that you get elsewhere.  It does indeed seem to come from tender, baby ginger shoots. My wife and I just love ginger.  We love crystalized ginger as a snack, or mixed in other foods, such as cookies, cranberry sauce, salad dressings, dipping sauces, truffles, all manner of ways.  It is a secret ingredient.  If you have never had good crystalized ginger, you have missed a real treat.<br /><br />I have only had one other crystalized ginger that I can say is better, which says a lot.  This is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />I have purchased other gourmet items from J&M Mushrooms in the past.  This ginger has always been fresh tasting, as have all of their other specialty items.  They seem to prefer to have a moree limited gourmet line, that they concentrate on and have great quality at very good prices.  Suits me.  If you are placing an order, you might check their other items as they are one of the few distributors of Spinosi Italian Egg Noodles (great product), and they have a great price on Madagascar Vanilla Beans.

review/summary: Crystalized ginger
review/text: I have been buying Australian Crystalized Ginger from Sweet Energy company for a long time.  Very tasty product but ridiculously expensive.  I therefore decided to give the current item a try.  It is a haphazard mix of good and bad pieces.  But what is very curious is the texture and substance of each piece.  If I could take a wild guess I would say that these pieces seem to be mashed ginger blended with sugar then compacted and molded into solid feeling coins.  On the outside too there is entirely too much sugar.<br />All in all this product is not up to par.

It has a lot of sugar on it too.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I prefer spicier ginger.  Pieces are perfectly regularly cut and even quality.

review/summary: NO Carb just as it claims but...
review/text: No carb Apricot fruit spread, should have warned me. All fruit has carbs, I was looking for a good flavor sugar free jam. This just doesn't have enough actual Apricot flavor for me and you certainly can't see any fruit due to the texture. It's like a cross between an apple butter and a jelly. I did find a sugar free fruit jam with lots of flavor but this wasn't it. It's nice enough, but the Kraft sugar free jams are better/cheaper and they didn't meet the fruit flavor test I am searching for. Sweet isn't good enough. I haven't tried any of their other products, maybe it's just the apricot that is like this.

review/text: I've been on a moderate protein/low carb/low fat program for months, and have a salad with my portion of meat and 2 cups of stir-fried vegees every night.  This spread is great for a sweet/sour dressing, like what you get with egg rolls.  Microwave a tablespoon or so to soften, add a dash of soy sauce and a dash of apple cider vinegar to brighten the flavor.  I top it with fresh cilantro.  Some of the Walden Farms items are awful, but this one is really good.

review/summary: Wonderful Non-caffeinated Tea!
review/text: I had to cut back on my green tea habit (apparently there is such a thing as too much), so I gave this a try.  It has an unusual smell, but the taste is somewhere between a full-bodied mate and a woody coffee/almond flavor.  I've developed a passion for this tea as the taste definitely grows on you.  I do use a slightly larger serving for 2 strainings (the 2nd cup is a little weaker but still good, saves money!).

review/text: I wanted something different besides green tea and chamomile and the rest of the usuals i have every day.  I searched for a while at my health food store for the right tea, and i found this one.  I've never heard of Rooibos before, but i liked the idea of almond and vanilla.<br /><br />I opened it in the car and sniffed it all the way home.  I could have steeped my tea a little bit longer, but the flavor was still great.  it was naturally sweet and didn't require any sugar or honey.  I paired it with vanilla soy milk.  I can't wait to introduce people to this tea.  I plan on trying other flavors by the same brand.

review/summary: Great rich taste and good for you - WOW!
review/text: I was forced by my Doctor to cut out caffeinated coffees and teas. That led me on a long search for something to replace the rich flavor of coffee and black teas. Flavor rich this organic herbal blend of Rooibos, vanilla and almonds is a great substitute for English breakfast. Add a little milk and honey and even the kids love it. I use a coffee press and make a cup every morning but with a more hot water the same herbs are good for a second cup. Rooibos is naturally decaffeinated and the added bonus is that it contains additional heath benefits such as antioxidants and minerals such as, magnesium, zinc and other things my doctor is happy about.

review/text: I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE(!!!) this tea blend! I've been a fan of rooibos (red or green), but I've never tasted something as delicious as this. It's funny to see that I'm not the only one who thought this smells and tastes like cherry! Everyone I asked to smell it said I was crazy. I suppose it depends on your sense of smell. If you love rooibos, black cherries, almonds, and vanilla, you'll love this tea too. If you've never had rooibos, good luck with getting any idea of what it tastes like before you actually taste it. It's pretty hard to describe, but it's very pleasant. Once again, this is one amazing tea!

review/summary: I'm starting to like this tea more after shortening the brewing time.
review/text: Upon opening the canister and taking a whiff, my first thought was, "OMG, they sent a canister of my grandfather's pipe tobacco!"  My grandfather died more than 40 years ago and I still recall the smell of his tobacco.  A pleasant smell for tobacco, but not for tea!<br />Getting past the aroma, I brewed a cup per the instructions and ... didn't like it  ... at all.<br />A few days later, I thought I'd try again.  Brewed it again, using solidly boiling water and let it steep 6 minutes again, as recommended.  Again, failure in the taste bud and aroma department.<br />Finally, I got up the courage to try it one more time this week.  I again used rapidly boiling water but only steeped if for 3 minutes... and  I like it!! A shorter steeping time cuts the overwhelming vanilla flavor (and aroma) but keeps the pleasant rooibos flavor and color and allows a hint of almond to hover in the background.<br /><br />I don't think this will ever be a "favorite" tea of mine but I'm finding it drinkable now.  I'd actually rate it a 3.5 stars if that were an option.<br /><br />It comes with two tins of tea and I'm going to pawn the 2nd tin of it off on my sister ...  :-)

review/summary: Spectacular Tea
review/text: I became interested in rooibos tea after reading Alexander McCall Smith's No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series. As she ponders the vagaries of human nature and thinks about her most recent case, Mma Ramotswe, Smith's crack private investigator, always sips a soothing cup of redbush tea.<br /><br />I later learned that redbush, or rooibos, tea has tremendous health benefits. According to some experts, it rivals green tea in the number of polyphenols it contains. Some describe it as anti-aging and anti-carcinogenic as well.<br /><br />On its own, rooibos tea can be a little harsh. It has sort of a dusty, metallic taste that isn't particularly pleasant.<br /><br />Red Rocks tea, however, has none of that rusty taste. As other reviewers have said, the vanilla and almond give it a gentle nutty sweetness. There is no bitter aftertaste, and the tea needs no additional sweetening or flavoring of any kind. A five-minute steep makes for the perfect cup.

review/summary: Soothing tobacco tea with almonds to munch!
review/text: This is one of those tobacco teas that some people dislike, unlike them, I tremendously enjoy the aroma of fine African rooibos red tea with slight vanilla hint, and 1 or 2 hiding pieces of almonds at the bottom of the cup when I am done.  It's good to drink at anytime of the day, but I prefer it after 5 PM or later as it has no caffeine, the rest of teas I drink contain some traces of caffeine (green, white) which I leave for the second part of the day.  Rooibos tea is a fantastic tea containing full arsenal of antioxidants, protects the liver, fights viruses and has many other medicinal properties.  I am finishing my jars of loose green tea and won't come back to it because of caffeine (even small traces of caffeine is really a light carcinogen, I bet you didn't know! :) ).  In reality, herbal teas like rooibos, chamomile, st. john's wort, hibiscus, Melissa (lemon balm) etc, beat green and white teas, and are some of the finest teas that fight viruses, bacteria, HIV, hepatitis, herpes infections (HSV 1 and 2), protect the liver, normalize several blood values decrease lipoperoxidation, increase antioxidant defenses, etc. (hibiscus for example decreases oxalic acid (stone) formation in kidneys). So herbal teas are your friends, treat them with boiling water and they will take care of you with time.  Another great idea, if you are adventurous, is to mix several herbal teas together to have a synergistic effect.

review/summary: WoW!!!
review/text: This is my first review ever, and holy crap! This is the best extract I've ever had. The smell and the taste is amazing, I plan on using it for cupcakes and this summer using it for lemonade and different iced teas. I'll be trying a lot more of these extracts in the future! Great price and it came quick.

review/summary: Great Flavor and good value
review/text: I use the extract in cakes and icings and I find it to be very good.  It provides a solid raspberry flavor using the normal 1tsp amount.  Some extracts I end up using a Tbsp or more to get the right flavor intensity, but this one seemed perfect!

review/summary: Really really worth buying!
review/text: No, it isn't quite regular ice cream.  Yes, it is a bit of a taste compromise.  But it is only 136 calories for the ENTIRE PINT so did you expect Ben & Jerry's?!  The best thing when you're in need of comfort food is tucking into a pint of ice cream ... right?  But if we do that, we all know the potential bad outcome, don't we?!  First the guilt, then the scale.  Yikes, what a duet of misery.  It all stops if you have this truly delicious ice cream.  It's tasty ... the flavors are terrific (this strawberry banana is the best IMO).  And, you can down the entire pint for about the same number of calories as a large apple.  Hmmm.  Apple?  Ice Cream?  Is there a choice here?.....<br /><br />BTW - Amazon ships it in dry ice.  Mine sat on my front porch in the heat for an entire day and was still rock hard when I got to it.  No worries about shipping.

review/summary: Here I go again.
review/text: I ordered the chocolate last time, and this time opted for the strawbery banana. Ordered it and got it within 2 days, and it arrived solid as a rock frozennnnn. They must have packed it with a ton of dry ice because I had to let one of the pints sit out for at least 20 minutes before I could eat it. As for the taste, really good. It reminded me of an italian gelato, it was really creamy. Really surprised me for being so low calorie and fat free to taste as good as it did.

review/summary: Wonderful healthy treat
review/text: I bought the chocolate, vanilla and strawberry/banana flavors and got them today. The shipping is great...very fast and it came frozen solid. The strawberry/banana flavor is delicious. Very subtle, not too sweet and no unpleasant aftertaste. I think the chocolate is my favorite, but that's just my chocolate frenzy speaking. All of the flavors are really really good for a low calorie treat. I'm still having trouble wrapping my mind around the fact that I can eat a whole pint of this for less than 150 calories. Arctic Zero will fill a serious void in my life. I won't have to stare in envy at my husband eating a whole pint of ice cream while I make do with a mini-treat. Thank you Arctic Zero!

review/summary: Strawberry is my FAVE but Krogers doesn't carry this flavor....
review/text: My 3rd or 4th purchase, at least, of Arctiz Zero. I love it!!! Voluntary recall for relabeling has forced me to get my fix by ordering online. I miss my strawberry anyway. Multiple requests to get strawberry at Krogers were met with big fat "I can't help you because we supply what our warehouse gets and have no control over that, blah, blah, blahhhhhh....." so here I am again... ;0)

review/summary: Dont buy this on line!
review/text: I have had this Arctic Zero before in strawberry and I liked it.  I ordered it after reading the reviews that it arrived hard as a rock.  Mine arrived soupy and warm!  What a mess, the package was leaking!  I know I live in South Carolina and it is summer but don't guarantee what you can't deliver!  I am hoping to get a refund as this stuff is not exactly cheap!

review/summary: Rather true to form - right amount of sweetness
review/text: First, I am a big fan of Arctic Zero.  The strawberry flavor is probably the truest to form taste-wise, as it really does take like strawberry ice cream.  It has the right amount of sweetness; whereas, for my taste, some of the other flavors do not.  Arctic Zero is like ice cream, but then it's kind of not like ice cream. It's very hard to explain, but there's more ice than cream to it, if you follow me. However, these are great, low-calorie treats, and you really can polish off a pint and not feel terrible about yourself!
