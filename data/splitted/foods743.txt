review/summary: BEST baked chips ever!!
review/text: I had these chips on vacation and could never find them in any of my local stores including Whole Foods.  On a whim, I checked Amazon and was so happy to find that they sold them and they were a pretty good price too.  I was little worried about ordering chips online, the expiration date, shipping and how we were going to get through all of them.<br /><br />No worries!  Only 3 bags left  - my husband and I love them.  The shipping was A+, with double boxes and air bags.  The chip bags are puffed up and you will need clippers or scissors to open it.  I don't mind because I think that's why they are so good and crunchy, not like the Guiltless Gourmet ones that taste like stale cardboard.  We make it to the bottom of the bag with very few crushed chips at all.  The fresh by date was 3 1/2 months from my date of purchase.<br /><br />The best part of all is the taste and nutritional quality of these chips.  One serving has 120 calories with 3 grams fat, 3 grams protein and 3 grams of fiber which for chips is pretty good.  Yes, they are not like blue corn regular chips with twice the fat, but they are the best ones out there that are baked.<br /><br />I will definitely be reordering again!

review/summary: YUM.  A chip that tastes good and has all natural ingredients
review/text: Love, love, love these chips.  They taste so good baked in the oven with cheese.  I am glad I bought the case.  I thought it would take the family a while to go through them but we have already gone through 4 bags.  When my parents babysit it is the first item they take out of the cabinets to snack on while reading.  Great product at an amazing price.

review/summary: Garden Of Eatin' Blue Corn Chips
review/text: Corn chips, you can't have just one and therein lies the problem. The crunch, the salt, the flavors are so addictive.  Not only are they perfect by themselves but they are a vessel for deliciousness. Whether its guacamole, salsa, refried beans, hummus, you name it.  My favorite these days has to be blue corn chips, they have a deeper almost burnt flavor to them which I can't seem to get enough of.  Garden Of Eatin' blue corn chips are my chips of choice.  They have the crunch, the salt, the flavor, not to mention they are organic and GMO free. I got so excited when they went on sale that I ended up crushing some of the bags as I grabbed them.  I feel bad for the person who got the bag of crumbs, I have to contain myself next time around.

review/summary: a little too salty for my tastes....but....
review/text: I liked everything about this chip except they are too salty...  I accomodated by making my gracamole, and other dips salt free.  Balanced them out.  Texture is wonderful, great corn taste.  I brush excess salt off with a paper towel if I just want to snack dip free.  I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to "clean" before eating.  I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own.

review/summary: Great taste...very poor packaging
review/text: These taste great.  More of a restaurant style chip taste as opposed to a Frito-Lay for the masses taste.<br />Salty enough too, unlike say Tostitos which have reduced the salt far too low.  But you folks might want to revisit your packaging.  You know how you grab a bag of chips at the top and pull apart the seam to open?<br />These seams have been sealed with titanium.  And if you eventually manage to pull it apart, of course the rest of the bag is made of the same far too easily ripped all the way down the side to hope to reseal the bag, as every other manufacturer uses today.

review/summary: Blue, no salt added -- amazing!!
review/text: I've been a subscriber to the Blue Chips with no salt added for about a year now and love them. These chips are great for nachos or with good salsa, and probably other things I haven't tried. Now that I've been eating them without salt for so long, eating salted chips is like an overload. You'll get used to it and appreciate the health benefits.<br /><br />I only wish they were cheaper and came in bigger bags!<br /><br />My mouth is watering now...

review/text: This product when received became an instant household staple I share with many others.<br /><br />The unsalted "snack foods" offered through Amazon can be delivered in case-quantity then set out at social events to introduce others to healthier eating.<br /><br />And one can produce "dips" for selection at such social events by simply food-processing ordinary, or, ideally, organic, vegetables, also shipped through Amazon sellers or found locally.<br /><br />Experiment.  That's healthy to do.  Your own body is your own body.  Feed your own body carefully.<br /><br />Clint Williams<br />Oakland, Michigan USA

review/summary: not correc size
review/text: This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.

review/summary: Very  old stock
review/text: I received this product from Amazon who sent me the oldest stock possible. The postage alone cost about $60 and i ordered about $60 worth of the product. Most of the items I received were only 2 to 3 weeks from their sell by date and are rancid or stale. It was a huge disappointment receiving these and I will never order this product again.Neither will i recommend anyone buy this product from Amazon. It makes you think that Garden of Eatin products are not good but I have bought them before at my local grocery store and they tasted great,so I know for sure that the problem is with Amazon stock. For me, thats $120 wasted as returns are apparently not possible. very very disappointed with Amazon.com, because i shop at Amazon.co.uk very often and have rarely been disappointed and even when there have been disappointments, they are immediately rectified. Amazon.com does not allow refunds or returns on this item, so beware!

review/summary: THE REAL Secret Sauce for the true burger Conisieur !
review/text: I first found this last summer in the Chicago area at a local grocery store. Picked it up with my tastbuds starting to salivate while visions of the Original Hardees Burger with their special secret sauce flashed back from my memory banks. Too good to be true my logical thoughts kept telling me,I'm just fanticising and wishing to capture any sensory perception from my youth.  My tastebuds and nose remembers the wonderful aromas and tastes Hardees secret sauce covered burgers induced! Not possible to recapture the greatest tasting secret sauce ever made , no way can we recapture our youth my mind kept repeating , just can't be done! Scientist say of all the things we easily forget ( sounds,tasts,names),our noses never forget aromas and sensations from the past good or bad. Just try to conjure up some smells on your own ,why we really do vividly remember all we have smelled , without smell you can't taste the taste of chocalate ! Anyways I ate so many of those Hardees burgers with their special secret sauce I will be the expert to decide if the past can be returned to as a time lord ,Dr. Who if you will.<br />Are you ready ? ! This IS the real deal Super Special Secret Burger Sauce from my past and more !! I was instantly amazed by Krafts ability to take me back to the future . What a wonderful Mayonaise worthy of being so good it has to be a secret on your burger, mayonaise made ever so zesty ,so light yet perfectly full body mayonaise with a super spiced sweet taste all it's own. Anyways if you enjoy mayonaise on your burger and want to be a time lord like Dr. Who get this stuff as it is truely the best. Even if you aren't old enough to remember Hardees and their secret sauce , once you try this you will not forget it's taste and how special it makes your burger -just Awesome ! I think it is so good though Kraft is having a problem some how getting it back on the shelf.They say it's just so new and secret it takes time to get it in the stores but I think they are having legal issues with someone from the past maybe ? Write to Kraft and let them know you want it,I promise you will enjoy !

review/summary: The Best Tonic
review/text: I love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005SLSVNE">Fever-Tree Premium Tonic Water, 16.9-Ounce (Pack of 8)</a>! No corn syrup like the big or generic store brands--so it is not cloyingly sweet--just real cane sugar. Only 90 calories per half bottle (8 oz.). I use it with gin or vodka and even created my own drink with it, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FR0BQ">San Pellegrino Chinotto 6 pack, 6.75 oz bottles</a>, and a Florida orange vodka. With this tonic the botanicals really are subtle. Perhaps a bit too subtle, but the amount of quinine is just right. Q-tonic is much too bitter for my liking. The diet Fever Tree Tonic is bleh. You should never skimp with a fine cocktail; a little bit of sugar in your tonic is better than a whole lot of corn syrup or chemical sweeteners (IMO).<br /><br />Amazon's price is competitive with the "mo" big beverage warehouses. The convenience of not having to lug home multiple bottles is an advantage. I use about half a bottle for a Junipero Gin & tonic.<br /><br />Ingredients list is: Spring water, cane sugar, citric acid, Natural Flavors, Natural Quinine.<br /><br />There is an admonition not to store in direct sunlight, and there is an expiration date on the label. All this points to a quality product with the minimum of preservative additives (i.e., I am not sure if the citric acid is used as one in this application). It's made in the UK, where gin and tonics have been enjoyed for far longer than in the USA.<br /><br />The best part of shopping at Amazon is no bottle redemption value tax! If you're a cheapskate, like me, remember to factor in the extra $0.05 off if you live in CA, ME, VT, CT, MA, NY, OR, IA, HI, DE, or--if in MI--$0.10!<br /><br />Now, if only Amazon sold and shipped fresh limes . . .

review/text: I have tried them all, but these are by far superior.  Have liked the Pure De-lite Imported Pure Belgian Chocolate Bars in the past, but tried these and will not go back.  Nothing comes close to the rich taste and texture in SugarFree and carb lite bars.  At approximately $1/oz, a fair price for a great product!  I also received an email from the company asking of I needed special cold shipping since I lived in Texas.  I have purchased since and will buy again.

review/text: I was hoping to find a decent tasting, low carb, dark chocolate bar. But unfortunately this is not it. The taste is terrible, very bitter. The texture seems a little brittle compared to better chocolate. It also leaves an unsatisfactory aftertaste, not as good as other dark chocolate bars. It is certainly not worth the more than $6.00 per bar (when you add in the postage) that is charged.

review/summary: Great taste until the price increase
review/text: I've been buying the YC Chocolate brand for many years (the milk chocolate with almonds version).  In 2006 the price was $25.27 for a BOX OF 10 (web orders, but not directly from the producer, ycchocolate.com).  In the past several years I could only buy directly from the producer for $29.90 (box of 10) plus a free bar for each box ordered.  I've been running low lately and when I went to the usual web site, I found they were now selling for $40 per BOX OF 8!!  Today I checked again and the price is now $42 for a box of 8, from ycchocolate and from amazon.  Needless to say, they have lost me as a regular customer.  The chocolate is among the best "no sugar added" chocolates (it's as good as regular chocolate), I would recommend them to anyone.  But with a price increase of 78%, no way.

review/text: I tried a sample of this at Costco today and was so thrilled at the results. I had been running errands all day and long overdue to eat. My stomach was starting to grumble and I had some extremely painful hunger pains starting. After I took the sample I headed to the check out and finished my shopping trip. By the time I got home the hunger was gone. I had forgotten all about it. In fact it was so effective, nothing sounded good and I had to force myself to eat something. That level of hunger and craving control lasted all day. I had great energy and my mood seemed lifted. Needless to say I went back before they closed and bought a bottle. So far, this stuff is awesome and I'll continue to use it as long as it works. I have been battling the last 10-15 pounds for years! All because I have uncontrollable cravings. I work out and they get even worse. This is my answer :)

review/summary: Dislike new flavor 'Nopal Cactus'
review/text: I also tried my first taste sample at Costco and it was the Pomegranate flavor so I bought a bottle and started using it daily...Months later Hoodia offered a new flavor at Costco and that was the Acai Berry.  I liked that even better and many months went by continuing to consume my daily dose of Hoodia Fiber every morning...A couple months ago I went to replenish my supply and to my dismay there was nothing but Nopal Cactus flavor on the shelves at my local Costco and even though the thought of cactus flavor did not sound appealing I purchased 1 bottle and the next morning when I gulped my little shot down it almost came right back up. The rest of the month I would plug my nose every time I had to swallow that swill and I would have some kind of food at the ready so I could immediately take a bite of it to wash away the nasty taste that was left in my mouth from the Cactus crap.  I have now stopped using the product and will not use it again until they offer the the Acai Berry or Pomegranate flavor. I really loved the product as it was first introduced to me.  Why did they have to ruin it?

review/summary: There are reasons to prefer 500 count, 1/2 grain tablets
review/text: Like everyone but Waldee, I was delighted to find Necta Sweet 1/2 grain tablets at Amazon. Why Necta Sweet (and I have no connection to the company) and 1/2 grain tablets? Calling on my many years experience with other brands, they dissolve faster and are the right size for me. I have used tablets that just sat in the bottom of even a hot cup of tea, never mind ice tea. If you're really watching your sodium be aware that there is a small amount of sodium bicarbonate that makes it fizz when it contacts any acidic liquid. Also I like 1 tablet/cup of tea but 2/cup of coffee hence the preference of 1/2 vs 1 grain tablets. Finally, the pills remaining in the bottle are worn away by the repeated tumbling action during each use. My experience is that by the time I'm near the bottom of a 500 tablet bottle there is already enough powder at the bottom to be a mild nuisance in that it gets on my fingertips. With a 1000 count bottle I suspect it would be much worse. No biggie but still.... Finally, the 12 pack that I purchased 2 years ago is just now running out despite my wife and my consuming 10-15 cups of tea or coffee daily so I don't see cost as a big issue unless you are running a restaurant or have a really big family.

review/text: Like so many other reviewers, I too have been using Necta-Sweet for nearly 40 years.  I love it because there is no aftertaste or calories and takes no time to throw 2 tablets into my tea or coffee to sweeten my drinks to my liking. When it became difficult to find this product in the stores, I tried a liquid version with similar ingredient and found it frustrating to measure out the right amount of drops into my drinks; it was either not sweet enough or too sweet.  Trying out other sugar substitutes with different ingredient than Necta-Sweet left aftertastes.  So when I found this product being sold on Amazon, I was absolutely thrilled.  Thank you Amazon!

review/summary: Try It---You'll LOVE IT!
review/text: I've been using NECTA SWEET (1/2 GR.) for more than 20 years; my wife for over 10 years (ever since we met 10 years ago). Both of us have found the tablets so much quicker to dispense the product (and easier to transport) than the 'paper packet' variety; whether to choose the 1/4 GR. or the 1/2 Gr. is dependent on how much sweetener you prefer. Unlike some of the other brands of sweeteners on the market, NECTA SWEET doesn't leave any negative 'after-taste' effects when added to your choice of beverage. Finally, you will find Amazon's price and guaranteed service difficult---if not impossible---to beat! (And, 'NO,' neither my wife nor I work for NECTA SWEET or Amazon nor have any affiliation with them except for being 'Happy Campers' with this product! For the record, we last purchased 12 bottles of NECTA SWEET on 5/30/08...and again today.)

review/summary: Great price for fantastic little animal crackers
review/text: I bought these on the S&S program and think the price is amazing.  Buying these in the store is ridiculously expensive.<br /><br />Barbara's makes a larger size serving pouch, but I find that they don't get finished by my kids and wasted.  So the 1-oz is perfect for our outings to the zoo or as a quick snack in the car.  They are tasty and delicious for adults too.  Just the right amount of crunch.  Some other brands of animal crackers leave a lot to be desired in that department - they tend to be too soft and mealy.<br /><br />The only thing you should be aware of is the expiration date on these packages.  One time they sent them and there was only a month left to go, and there is no way my kids go through 36 pouches in one month.  Amazon's customer service graciously apologized and took care of the problem, but just make sure you check it when you receive it.  I don't think they have much control over the dates, but I would like to see them ship bulk grocery items like this with at least 3-4 months left on the shelf exp dates.

Brown up a pack of Little Smokies and some diced ham, maybe toss in some chicken, throw in the Jambalaya Mix with some of the rice taken out before cooking to make it a little soupier. Cook for 30 minutes...man oh man!<br /><br />OK, so this isn't the healthiest thing I eat, so I only make it a few times a year with the low sodium version. I'm sure the sodium content of the finished dish is still off the charts, but a few times a year, what the hell.

I add ground turkey to this instead of ground beef sometimes and also sausage meat is great with this. The 12 oz box is terrific as I can't find that larger size in my local (boston MA) markets.  Zatarains prices have risen (hurricane?) in my area but the Amazon price is right!

review/text: I am a seriously NOT recovering Chocoholic and the combination of my love affair w/ cookies and chocolate makes it a somewhat dangerous enterprise for me to keep these on hand. They do not last long in an unguarded pantry, even when hidden. It seems one of my grown sons will polish off an entire bag in one sitting if he happens to find it.  These are good, just slightly chewy straight out of the bag, but if you can control yourself for approx. 10 seconds per cookies, they are even better with a brief zap of the microwave. These are fattening so try your best to temper your binges!

Some of them start eating it right away, others take to it little slower - eventually all of them eat all I put out. I can tell, because the yolks of the eggs they lay are very thick and very orange. They were great before, but now, after the flax seed snacks, they are the best eggs in the state of Colorado. Period.<br /><br />Oh, and daily ingestion of the flax seed by yours truly seems to bring amazing regularity to the daily bathroom routine...  just soak it in your favorite yogurt overnight, and enjoy.

So if you were on the fence about trying this product, thought I'd let you know that it is a real crowd please, young and old love this beverage.<br /><br />Even I like it and I don't care for carbonated beverages (they give me terrible hiccups) but whenever he gets one of these sodas, I ask him to save the last sip for me.<br /><br />As others have said, the taste is very cucumber-y and the smell is fantastic, if they made a shampoo that smelled like this, I'd wash my hair twice a day with it!  I wasn't as offput by the thought of cucumber soda as I was at dandelion soda (burdock and dandelion soda is my husband's fave soda) but all the same, when my hubby and son brought home bottles of Mr. Q, I wasn't eager to try it.  But after much urging and rapturous expressions from my son, I drank a little and it was as crisp, refreshing and just the tiniest bit sweet as they'd said, all in all, perfection.<br /><br />Try it, I bet you'll like it.

I had found it once many years ago with McIlhenny's BBQ sauce, but then could not find it for sale anywhere.

review/summary: My Pup loves it!!
review/text: We had been feeding our pup another premium brand of large breed puppy chow. Though early on when we first got him he would eat without a problem at times he would leave some and maybe eat it later. He finally reached a point where he became very picky, and to get him to eat we had to mix canned food with the dry. He was having some tummy problems and our vet suggested the Royal Canin. We figured we would give it a shot, none of our local pet stores carry the puppy chow so we ordered from Amazon. It arrived and we gradually switched him over, you could tell right from the start he liked it ALOT. Once we had him fully switched over to the Royal Canin there were no more tummy problems (nice solid stools) and he absolutely LOVES this dogfood! It has been a month now and when feeding time rolls around he starts getting excited, and is very enthusiastic about the meal, once he starts eating he doesn't stop and it's gone in no time! He looks good, has lots of energy. Oh, and no more smelly canned food to deal with :).

She has grown to her full size and is not at all overweight like some other dogs we know that are fed the grocery store brands.  Many people have commented on what a beautiful dog she is.

review/text: We got our German Shepherd x Border Collie 2 weeks ago and had started her on Taste of the Wild High planes, but she had troubles chewing it because it was so hard. We tried moistening it and/or adding canned food to it, which made her somewhat more interested, however she was gulping more than chewing and made it hard for her to digest. She often had loose stools because of it. Now she is on this and she loves her food. She even loves it so much that we incorporate part of her daily serving with her "training treats." The lower protein content I also read was better for large breed dogs because they need less protein because they grow so rapidly. She's thriving on this food. Thanks for the quality product.

The ingredients are perfect (meats first!).<br />However, it is about $20 cheaper if you can find a retailer near you that you can buy it from. Your veterinarian might know of someone. My vet uses Royal Canin for her dogs, so I am going to buy it from her from now on.<br />Great product! Too pricey on Amazon though....

review/text: My 10 month old German Shepherd was having problems digesting her old food, another one of those "all natural, no artificial ingredients, etc" types. She'd eat it, but her stools would be loose and she'd have occasional bouts of diarrhea. Finally, she stopped eating her food altogether. I was getting frustrated and worried that she had stopped eating.<br /><br />At the recommendation of a friend, I tried Royal Canin German Shepherd Puppy formula. I purchased the smaller bag just in case. Without even having to transition her to the new food, she immediately took a liking to this brand. She eats it excitedly, and her stools have become much more solid.

review/text: This stuff is great! I switched my 8 week old female GSD puppy to this about a week after I got her (the breeder gave me a bag of the food she was feeding her dogs...I think it was IAMS...) and immediately she had no more problems with diarrhea. In addition, I also sprinkle on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003153TEA">Missing Link 8-Ounce Puppy Health Formula</a> and "Schatzi" loves it! I had no proof that these items worked well together until I visited the breeder when my puppy was ~4months old. The breeder still had one of my puppy's sisters (from the same litter), and there definitely was a noticeable difference between their coats. The ingredient's include copper proteinate and copper sulfate, which is probably why my puppy's coat was MUCH more glossy and her color's are more pronounced. The first bag lasted about a month, and I have already bought my second bag, which isn't bad for ~ $1.75/day -especially with the prime/free 2 day shipping option. She really likes this food and never leaves anything behind, and I will continue to buy!
