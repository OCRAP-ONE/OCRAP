review/text: We ordered these only because the Black Beans and Rice,which we really. really love, was out of stock.  After about a week, we finally opened up a package and then kicked ourselves for not having tried them earlier.  There is a little kick to them after you swallow them to let you know you have had a hint of hot pepper of some sort.  We took them to a pot luck that night and came home with an empty bag.  I used them, from another bag, as a garnish on a salad that I took to the pot luck and we came home with an empty salad bowl!<br />We will definitely order these again.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWLUGU">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Red Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

On my trips back home, I would buy a bunch of bags to bring back with me to NC.  Then I discovered that I could order them on-line and life was great.  These chips are my all time favorite and everyone that I serve them to loves them just the same.  You just gotta try them ... you'll be hooked !!!  ..... Nancy Walsh

review/summary: Perfect tortilla chip goodness!
review/text: My husband (who, being Mexican, is very picky about his tortilla chips) and I absolutely love these!  The texture is light and crispy, rather than thick and crunchy. He actually usually prefers a very hearty, cruncy chip (Like El Ranchero), but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we're both thilled with them. The bean, rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful, and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that. We go through an embarrassing amount of them.  I never, ever like plain chips, but these I can eat without anything else, although they're particularly amazing with a fresh salsa.  I highly recommend these!

review/summary: Meh
review/text: I guess there's no telling what will tickle the palate.  I'm a huge Tabasco fan, and I love unconventional snacks.  But these don't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they're made from; I didn't find them to have much of a kick at all.  Practically bland, in fact.  Even with my strong aversion to wasting food, I had to throw out or give away most of the case.  Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12.

review/summary: The "Organic" Label is Misleading
review/text: "Yeast Extract" is listed as an ingredient. Sounds harmless, right? Specifically, these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract, which is, on a chemical level, monosodium glutamate. It's just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing "No MSG" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities.

review/text: Plocky's chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness.  They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips.  The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten.  They hold up great to salsas and dips.  Nothing wimpy about them.  I just wish the company made a bigger bag!  Love them.  Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery, but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty.  Order by the case.  You'll be glad you did as they disappear fast.

Needless to say most of the chips were broken and I would not order them again.  A great item but if they can't package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money.

review/text: Long story short - these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.<br /><br />BUT... as noted by another reviewer - these contain MSG in the form of "Yeast Extract".<br /><br />It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.<br /><br />Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive.

review/text: Looking for a change, I decided to pick up a box of these. The taste is quite different from what I am used to. The texture is more like the oats style so there is a bit more of a crunch to it than other cereals. The taste feels to have a little less of the sugary aftertaste as Cinnamon Toast Crunch. It also appears to be slightly more healthy but I don't have a box handy to compare. With Subscribe and save, the prices are cheaper than Trader Joes so if you are already a fan, this is the place to get it.

review/text: 12 fluid ounces of this stuff for $8.99 a pop is about the only negative I could find with this outstanding substitute for the long discontinued Knott's Berry Farm variety. Whereas fruit syrups generally retail for no more than $3.00 per bottle, the scarcity of Apricot trees in California must be driving the price of this product, then again Casa De Fruta is not exactly a discount store. I was curious and decided to determine what a gallon of syrup would run...$95.89 / gallon which would buy you nearly 24 gallons of Unleaded fuel at $4.00 / gallon.<br /><br />A great product, a not so great price.

review/text: I have always been a consumer of Postum. I was quite unhappy when they discontinued it. My wife was looking for an alternative beverage and found Pero. She purchased one container for me to try. It is different from Postum, but also similar. I like it and actually don't miss the Postum anymore. I would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a Postum subsitute.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ESLJ6C">Pero Instant Natural Beverage, 7-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Pero Instant Beverage:<br />I purchased Pero Instant Beverage to replace caffeine drinks; because I like a warm drink especially in cold weather, but I had too much of a love of and over did coffee.  Pero come the closes I have found the coffee taste, but did not give me the jitters.  As for taste it is far from coffee but the closest I have found and not a bad substitute.  In fact I have learned to like it.

review/summary: A great substitute Coffee and late Chocolate like drink
review/text: Last year I had a serious medical problem with silent acid reflux and I had to stop drinking coffee, which I love and drank daily. I also had to stop eating/drinking Chocolate. I checked out a few places and this product was highly recommended. Now I would rather drink this than coffee. I drink it every day and it is so nice to have it at night before bed now. I could never do that with coffee or I would be up all night.<br /><br />My friend also started drinking Pero and he thinks it is great also.<br /><br />This is a great product - You never need coffee again after dringing this.<br />It is a little messy like chocolate on cups but no big deal.<br /><br />I would recommend this even if you don't have a problem with coffee.<br />Phil

review/summary: Not Postum But Pero is an Interesting Substitute
review/text: I'm very sensitive to caffeine even to decaf but can drink decaf early in the day but not late afternoon or at night. In the winter, I like to drink something hot at night and to me Pero is a perfect beverage for that since they took Postum off the market and can be a nice alternative if you wanted something a little heavier than herbal tea.  It doesn't have the bitterness of coffee, and is flavorful with a nutty background taste.  I tried Cafix at the same time and was surprised that I like Pero better since Cafix has a couple of more ingredients.  Just a warning - it's doesn't taste like Postum.

review/text: My wife and I have used PERO for many years, it's the best substitute for coffee that we've come across. The only problem we've ever had is finding a distributor. Initially, it was available only through a company in Salt Lake City, then New Jersey, and now through Amazon. Through the years the quality has always been consistently good. If you are looking for a coffee substitute made from grain, try this one.

review/summary: GREAT COFFEE SUBSTITUTE
review/text: Amazon offered a great special price. I've been drinking PERO since the 1970s. It's a FABULOUS tasting coffee substitute...VERY RICH and DELICIOUS. I don't even think  of it as a "coffee substitute." It's just a great tasting hot beverage without caffeine---but so delicious tasting that it stands on it's own. I drink it with cream and sugar-- and sometimes add other yummy extras--like cinammon sugar, or syrups, like<br />caramel, for a drink which is so rich it's like a dessert.

review/summary: natural alternative to coffee
review/text: I used to drink cups of coffee but it gave me diarrhea.  My job at a nuclear power plant at night demands that I sit for long periods and can not take bathroom breaks frequently.  I looked for a natural alternative to coffee.<br /><br />PERO is what I found.  It is about $5 a can, which is said to make 175 cups.  The taste isn't the most exhilarating but it's okay on cold days with cookies or burnt toast.  I use milk, not water as I'll vomit if I use water.  In all, it's healthy and a basic drink if you suffer from stomach cramps or tied up intestines.  I have 5 cups a day, along with a carton of French cigarettes.

review/text: I recently order a 6-pack of Pero - hopefully to find a substitute for the Postum I have been drinking for over 50 years. Let me tell you -- Postum it's not! It tastes awful, and the aroma (smell) is even worse. I mixed just one cup, took one sip, flushed the rest down the drain and gave away all six cans. Taste and smell, of course, are individualistic and arbitrary, but if you're looking for something as close as possible to the now extinct Postum, don't waste your money on this one!

While I still enjoy my morning caffeine fix, I have found that Pero is a perfect substitute for that jitters-inducing third or fourth cup of coffee, and it's also perfect as a no-worries hot drink for evening hours.  I've also found that it mixes well with coffee, if you're looking for a half-and-half type of beverage.<br /><br />If you're like me in that you find decaf barely tolerable, then I wholeheartedly suggest you try Pero.  You won't mistake it for coffee, it has its own unique flavor, and it's very good.

Two containers of Pero (out of the case of 6) were unsealed and Pero powder covered everything else in the box.  I had to throw those two containers away . . . a waste, but I never use unsealed food items.  I tried to report the damaged shipment to Amazon, but apparently with any food item there is no refund or return.  You can't even report a problem unless it fits in their category of something you are allowed to return.  There is no phone number listed anywhere for customer service, but you are linked to many books about customer service.  I don't think I can afford to risk another food shipment from Amazon, considering it's a gamble on whether you'll get the items intact.

review/summary: Review of Roastaroma, Cafix, Pero, and Postum
review/text: I recently gave up coffee and decided to try three different coffee substitutes: Roastaroma, Cafix, and Pero. Although Cafix tasted the most like real coffee (and it tastes *a lot* like real coffee), and all three products are pretty good, Roastaroma was my favorite.<br /><br />It is very similar to coffee, but it doesn't quite have the bitter bite of coffee. Those of you who are looking for that slight bitterness might prefer Cafix. Roastaroma actually reminds me a little bit of Mexican hot chocolate--the cinnamon and carob flavors come through pretty strongly in the drink, giving it a cinnamon-chocolatey flavor. I used to drink coffee to satisfy my sweet tooth on low calories. This drink totally fits the bill for this purpose.<br /><br />The Pero is pretty good, too. Like Roastaroma, it doesn't have the bitter coffee taste, but it still makes for a decent imitation of decaf. I like to drink it with cinnamon-flavored powdered creamer. Pero's a good value, too: it's strong enough that you don't need to use very much to flavor your whole drink. I drink the Pero when I'm trying to ration the Roastaroma out to myself so as not to run out.<br /><br />So Roastaroma has the best flavor, Cafix tastes the most like coffee, and Pero is a good back-up.<br /><br />A quick note on Postum: I do not care for it. I find that people who like Postum tend to be people who were never coffee drinkers. It tastes nothing like coffee. If you try Postum as a coffee substitute, you will be disappointed.

review/summary: I Crave It Like Coffee!!!
review/text: I was a caffeine addict until it started to affect my health.  By the doctor's orders, I backed off the caffeine.  I went onto Amazon looking for decaf coffee, and I found Pero.  WHAT A GREAT FIND!!!  I now have several cups per day, but I don't feel guilty about it.  It has 3 ingredients--barley, malted barley, and chicory.  Maybe I am hooked on the chicory.  Is that possible?  I doubt it.  Anyway, I swear this stuff tastes more like coffee every time I drink it.  I have been tempted to play a practical joke with people at work by asking them to try my new "coffee".  I'll bet I could fool many of them.  I love Pero so much that I actually gave some to my Mom along with her chocolates for Mother's Day.  Love live Pero!

review/summary: Pero by mail
review/text: When Kraft quit making Postum we had to find an alternative - it was already an alternative to coffee, so this would be plan C.  We explored every avenue we could find in our small town at all the local stores and on the internet.  We found Pero on line and decided to stick our necks out to try a case of it.  We have not been disappointed.  We like it better than coffee.  It is smooth with no bitterness.  It mixes well with hot chocolate and tastes good straight and black if that's what you want.  We will be buying more of it and some friends will be doing the same after they tasted it.

review/summary: Very good coffee substitute
review/text: Pero is a real good coffee substitute - it does "foam" up (like hot cocoa) though.  It is more of a "mellowed" taste of coffee, which is still quite good - like you may have added just a touch of flavoring.  Cafix has more of a straight coffee taste.  But I like both and alternate between the two, depending on my mood.

review/text: My husband drank Pero when he lived in Argentina, loved it, and has been frustrated because it's been hard to find.  He gave some to a friend who was trying to quit drinking coffee and get rid of caffeinne in her diet.  She loved it too, and then found your site offering whole cases of it!  We immediately ordered a case ourselves.  We've shared our Pero with others who want a good-tasting, caffeine-free hot drink, and it's been welcomed enthusiastically.  Thanks for a great service.  Thanks for making a great healthy breakfast drink so easy to get.

review/text: I'm almost afraid to say how much I like this product for fear the price will go up or demand will go up and it will get tougher to find. Recently, at the home of a Latter-day Saint friend I was offered a cup of Pero served with a flavored creamer and it was A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Back in my coffee-drinking days I would easily go through 10 cups a day. I still love the smell of coffee and Pero has brought back the flavor without the jitters. I can have a cup before bed and not have a bit of trouble falling asleep. Thank you Amazon, for carrying this great little product at a great little price!

review/summary: Perfect "Coffee" for Tea Totalers and Caffeine Haters
review/text: My body doesn't handle caffeine well and I don't like its effects, even with black tea. Thank goodness for Pero. It's rich and robust without nasty caffeine because some of us tea totalers get tired of the wimpiness of herbal teas. I like to add milk and sugar for a richer coffee-like experience. And for those who thrive on instant gratification, it dissolves immediately without having to wait 3-5 minutes to seep. Pero costs almost twice as much in retail stores, so I was ecstatic to see it on Amazon at such a deal. Only problem is having six containers means that I'll probably won't have to buy Pero again until 2010.

review/summary: Next best thing to coffee...
review/text: I had to stop drinking coffee and caffeine for health reasons. My natural doctor placed me on a strict diet with Pero as a substitute for my coffee fix.  I am very pleased with it's flavor when I use it with cream.  The flavor is not a great to me without it.  You can taste the difference but it is as close as you can get.  I also tried the Cafix brand of coffee substitute. It wasn't as good to me.  For an instant coffee beverage this one is for me. If you want brewed flavor, give the Teeccino brand a try.

review/summary: I'm getting used to it...
review/text: Pero cannot compare to the complex, stimulating flavor of freshly brewed coffee. But, having cut back on coffee, I am learning to enjoy it as a substitute.<br /><br />When I first opened the canister I was hit with an aroma reminiscent of stale instant coffee. Unfortunately, my first taste of it only reinforced that impression. I've never been a fan of instant coffee, so I was initially underwhelmed. However, I decided to give myself a little time to get used to it. Now I can say that, as a healthful, alternative beverage, I actually look forward to a cup.<br /><br />It has a body and mouth feel somewhat reminiscent of coffee, and tastes enough like coffee that it helps satisfy my coffee craving. Even though I always take my coffee black, I add some milk to Pero which gives a little more smoothness and richness to the flavor.

review/summary: TERRIFIC PRODUCT!
review/text: My husband and I cannot have caffeine at all and so we had been drinking Postum until it was taken off the market, lost, gone, zip.  In searching the Internet, I discovered a blog about the tastiness of something called PERO and upon reading further, decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Let me tell you-- IT IS DELICIOUS!!  It even tastes like coffee that I can vaguely remember and so I feel like a real grown up again.  We drink it with fat-free half 'n half and that just adds even more flavor, so creamy and just plain good.  I would recommend this product to anyone that needs to completely eliminate caffeine, but actually it is so good that even real coffee drinkers should enjoy this without fear of over-caffeinating themselves or getting the "shakes" from too much caffeine.  Try it - you'll like it!!  The best price is at Amazon.com.<br /><br />Martha Scheuble

review/summary: Pero Coffee Substitute
review/text: My wife and I had been using Postum, but since it is no longer available, we chose Pero as one of our ingredients of our homemade International coffee mix.  Pero tastes remarkably similar to Postum but with less of a molassesy taste but Pero has a more distinctive flavor similar to coffee.  Pero  quickly dissolves in warm to hot water or beverages.  Pero has appealing taste when it is used alone or mixed with other powdered drink mixes.

review/summary: Pero brings me back to Germany
review/text: I've lived in the states for 28 years and my mom has been faithfully sending me care packages which contained Caro Kaffee (Pero) among other goodies. I happened to see the container in a catalog and immediately went online to search for it. And here it is. I grew up on this stuff and gave it to my kids disguised as "Kids Coffee". My mom said that they used to roast their own during the war because real coffee was scarce. Anyway, it has a mild flavor somewhat like weak coffee. The powder form foams up a little, especially if the water is too hot. The crystals in the dark roast dissolve easier, but that's no big deal. So I stir a few more times. We add sugar and milk as with coffee and enjoy. It doesn't hit a nervous stomach as caffeine would. And no, it is not a superior coffee if that's what you're looking for because it isn't coffee. I can't wait to tell my mom that she no longer has to mail it to me. Enjoy.

The order before last, the Pero still had the same great taste as I remembered having as a little girl. Then the order that I recently placed, tasted funny, like maybe the recipe was changed. It was also a bit of a lighter shade than my previous case. I would love to order another, but I want only one canister to make sure that I must have gotten a bad batch and not a change in recipe.

review/text: I know Caro from Europe, where it is a popular drink for those not hooked on caffeine and/or sugar. Pero is only a different name (possibly for advertisement purposes in the USA) In my native tongue "pero" also means "a spring" (elastic resilient coiled metal) , which well describes my daily morning cup.<br />Too bad US grocery stores don't carry it more often or ever. And if they do, they overprice it as some exotic drink from far away....hmmmm.... barley, chicory, rye. Right?

review/text: If you are looking for a substitute for the discontinued Kraft hot drink mix Postum, Pero doesn't taste much like Postum. Postum had a much smoother, slightly sweet taste. Pero has bitter flavor, that to me tastes like stale coffee. If you are a coffee drinker and want to cut down on caffeine, a good brand of decaf coffee tastes much better than Pero.<br /><br />By the way, Postum was made from from wheat bran, wheat, molasses, and maltodextrin made from corn. The ingredients of Pero are malted barley, barley, and chicory; so it is quite different.

review/text: I remember Pero from when I was a child. I grew up in Germany and that was always what my grandma would make for me rather than coffee. Children shouldn't drink coffee right?<br /><br />Due to my pregnancy I stopped drinking coffee because I could't leave the bathroom even if I only had a small cup of regular coffee, even decaf. But I LOVE Coffee...so I really had a hard time to adjust and I still love the smell of coffee, but can;t drink it anymore.<br /><br />Then I remembered a brew called Caro Landkaffe, which is the german version of Pero. I did so much research if it is actually available in the USA. Thank goodness I found Pero...........I was so delighted.<br /><br />As soon as it arrived I made myself a cup of Pero and I love it. To me it smells and tastes like coffee. Also you can adjust the strenght of your brew by adding one or two more spoons to your cup. So it really is as bitter as real coffee if you want it too.<br />I usually drink my pero with a hint of milk. I just love it.<br /><br />I really recommend it.
