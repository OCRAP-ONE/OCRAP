review/summary: Love Ella's!
review/text: We love all of Ella's Kitchen products, and our baby seems to enjoy this one.  We do add a bit of water to thin it out, as the products containing brown rice tend to be a bit too thick for a baby under 6 or so months.  I also wanted to point out that in our last shipment of this particular flavor, I noticed a few oddities on the nutrition information.  After a bit of searching, I realized that this particular order was "Product of Canada."  Not sure if this is at all a big deal (I doubt it), but just wanted to inform the seller and potential buyers.  Just seemed odd!

review/summary: Interesting texture and super-yummy!
review/text: My 6-month-old daughter loves all the "Brekkie" blends and we love knowing she's getting to experience a slightly different texture and a very different flavor as well.  I also love feeding her something knowing that I would enjoy it too, it helps me feel like I'm offering her the best (although I will feed her things I personally think are gross, because I don't want to limit her palate at all).  The pouches are the most convenient way to feed her too.  It helps keep the mess to a minimum and when used in conjunction with the Boon dispensing spoons, it turns feeding into a one-handed endeavor!  I was so excited to be able to introduce some different stuff once we got past the basics to check for allergies and all the exciting flavor profiles offered by Ella's are exactly what I wanted as a foodie mom.  Taste preferences develop at a surprisingly young age, so it's important to introduce lots of different flavors as soon as you can and thanks to all the modern baby food blends, I can find such a wide variety!  '  I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for some baby food.

review/text: My 10-month-old really likes her Mango Baby Brekkie, and who could blame her!  I tried it myself, and it's very yummy!  Plus, I can feel good about giving it to her for breakfast because it's organic, nutritious, and has no added sugar, unlike many other brands of similar baby food items on the market.  This product is a nice way to give my little-one a healthy combination of foods -- organic mango puree, yogurt and brown rice cereal -- in one neat package, without the need to open/peel and mix the all the ingredients by hand!  A great option for busy households during the morning "rush."

review/summary: "Best bone ever" says my dog (I swear he said it)
review/text: We bought this bone to replace one like it we bought at PetsMart about 2 1/2 years ago.  Our dachshund mix who is very playful will gnaw on it, but most of all he wants us to grab one slobbery end of the bone and play tug of war with him.  We do that many times every day.  Finally after nearly 2 1/2 years, little pieces were coming off so we had to replace it.<br /><br />We took this new bone out of the package and tossed it to him and he took to it like it was the same bone.  It is nearly indestructible and the best toy we have found for our dog.

review/summary: great chew toy. super durable
review/text: My boy boxer literally was chewing off the metal bars on his cage.  He was tearing up every toy we gave to him.  He has had this chew toy for over 2 years now and has not bit of any of the rubber.  There is one end that has a little abrasion, but nothing major.  It stays in his cage with him all day while we are at work and he chews on it at night.  We throw it for him and he fetches it.  I would recommend it for anyone.  There is also a black super tuff one that a friend of mine had for his pit bull.  The pit bull could chew through anything.  Even the other toys at the pet store that said they could not be chewed.  She chewed them up. But not the nylabone rhino.

review/summary: Nice coffee gift pack
review/text: I bought this gift pack for my mom since she likes to change flavors periodically. The coffee tastes good but the flavors are rather strong so we mix half a pack with regular coffee. I like that the coffee is ground since she does not have a grinder nor want to go through the trouble of whole beans. I wish this set did not have so many Columbian Supremo and had more flavors.  Last year I bought a similar pack on Amazon but it was caffeinated and had a better mix of flavors.It's a bit expensive with the shipping included, but it's a greatly appreciated treat. I haven't heard if she likes the taste of the decaf verses caffeinated.

review/summary: excellent size, quality, and packaging
review/text: I can't say enough good things about this antler:  after ordering the large size and having it arrive dried, cracked and ancient... well, it took me awhile to go out on a limb and order this from the same company.  We have been pleased enough with the quality that I won't hesitate to order another after he chews his way through this.  I have a larger Swiss Mountain Dog who chewed through a medium one of these in 3-4 days, but this monster size still has him going two weeks later.  I must note that just about any normal dog would be busy for the better part of a year with an antler like this so when longevity is factored into the cost equation, $18 makes a whole lot more sense.<br /><br />For anyone needing a natural, EXTREMELY durable treat for their beast to chew, antlers are the only way to go.  We have tried yak treats, beef bones, nylabones, and everything else we could find online or in both mainstream and specialty pet stores.  Antlers and silicone toys are the only thing I will buy him anymore because he destroys $35 "indestructible" toys in under an hour (lesser toys die a quicker, more violent death).

review/summary: My dogs love these!  They are huge...
review/text: My dogs love these!  They are huge compared to other "large" antlers and much cheaper if you calculate the price per Oz of the other antlers I purchased at PetCo.<br /><br />I have an aggressive chewer "10 yr old yellow lab" and will go through a large rawhide bone in about an hour or an X-large "everlasting dog treat" in about 30 minutes.  I also have a moderate chewer "2 yr old golden retrieve" who goes through the rawhide and "everlasting dog treat" in about twice the time as the lab.<br /><br />Both of my dogs work on these antlers almost daily.  We purchased two of Newts Chews Antler "Monster" size back in August and it's now October.  One of the chews is half it's original length and the other is about three quarters of it's original length.  The dogs seem to only chew on one end or the other and wear it down from the end.  There have not been any pieces break off that can be swallowed and cause a bowel obstruction, unlike rawhide.  They don't get all  gooie (is that a word?) and smelly like other treats we have tried.  Our dogs are mostly indoors so we need something that is safe, non-staining, non-smelly, durable, and cost effective.  This surly fits the bill.<br /><br />After trying all types of "indestructible", "long lasting", etc. dog treats.  These antlers are our favorite.

review/summary: Perfect summer treat!
review/text: I'm a huge fan of iced coffee, but I don't own a coffee pot.  I recall trying Starbucks VIA in stores a few months ago, and the barista telling me that it could dissolve in cold water or milk (unlike normal instant coffees), and tucked it away in the back of my head to try it this summer.  I was pleasantly surprised when Starbucks came out with the VIA Iced Coffee packages, mostly because it was designed for a 16 oz serving and lightly sweetened with sugar (100 calories in the entire packet, 50 calories for an 8 oz serving).  I add it directly to 16 oz of skim milk, add a little extra sweetener, and shake it all up in a water bottle.  It's delicious!  It has the classic Starbucks coffee flavor, without being overly bitter, because the coffee hasn't been brewed.  It dissolves almost instantly, sugar and coffee and all, in COLD liquid, with no residue or sediment at the bottom.<br /><br />At $1.00 a packet, it's not cheap - but it is cheaper than getting an iced coffee at Starbucks, and just as delicious - plus, you don't need to leave your house.  I used to make cold brewed coffee to drink iced, but that has to be done the night before to extract the full flavor, and then you need to strain it, and to make larger quantities was just cumbersome without the right equipment.  I love that I can just pour a packet into a water bottle, add water or milk and sweeteners, and instantly have delicious iced coffee!

review/summary: Too Much Sugar, 83% By Weight!
review/text: Initially I was a fan of Starbucks VIA Iced Coffee. It's convenient, it's tasty, and it's an affordable alternative to an in-store iced coffee. However after taking the product home, I was shocked to discover just how much sugar it contains. The first thing you notice when emptying the packet into a cup is the huge amount of white granules staring back at you.<br /><br />Each VIA packet contains 22g of sugar, and just 4.6g of coffee! This is the equivalent of SIX packets of sugar! Starbucks says each VIA is two servings, meaning 11g of sugar each, but you're likely to have the whole thing (14-16oz with water) in one sitting. That's 100 empty Calories (more if you're adding cream).<br /><br />PROS: Quick, tasty.<br />CONS: Too much sugar, slightly bitter/burnt taste.<br /><br />NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: Starbucks needs to either cut the sugar content in half, or make a "light" version using Splenda or Stevia as a sweetener.

I added half & half, and I couldn't have been happier.  At about $1/serving, you really can't complain.  It is much cheaper than a trip to the drive-thru!

review/summary: Looking forward to a low-cal version...
review/text: I love Starbucks iced coffee.  Although an iced coffee is actually one of Starbucks more affordable options, I've spent the summer spending about $50 a month... just in iced coffee!  In an effort to get my spending under control, I thought I would try Starbucks VIA caramel iced coffee.  Although I like the convenience and the lower cost, the drink is VERY sweet.  And certainly, 12g of sugar in a 8 oz serving is more than I would typically add to coffee on my own (a typical sugar packet is 2-4 g).  As someone who prefers to eat her calories as opposed to drinking them, I hope Starbucks will come out with a lightly sweetened option soon, as I do enjoy the caramel flavor.

review/text: Exactly what the product says... dissolves beautifully in cold liquids, and tastes much better than other instant coffees. I've gotten into the habit of adding it directly to some soymilk to make my own iced soy latte. It's on the sweet side (I prefer my coffee to have some bitter notes, this one is all sweet) but since the sugar actually dissolves in cold liquids I'm not complaining too hard. The caffeine level is pretty strong though; I normally have a cup or two of coffee a day and I'm fine, but one packet of this and I was bouncing off the walls. So be warned that while they claim that 1 full packet is a serving, it might not be the case for you.

review/text: I am always in the search for a yummy iced coffee to make at home and am so excited I finally tried this. The price was a little more than I wanted to spend, but compared to the real thing, it's a deal. This is how I make my wonderful glass of iced coffee: First of all, I am one of those people who enjoy a little coffee with their cream and sugar, so I only use a half packet at a time in a tall glass of cold water. I only fill the glass a little over half way full with water and mix in the half packet of coffee. Then, I pour in my milk, almost to the top of the glass, and add 2 HEAPING spoon fulls of condensed sweetened milk that I keep in a container in the fridge where it'll last for a long time. That stuff is a bit sticky, (as is anything wonderfully sweet) so stir stir stir! With a few ice cubes thrown in to keep it cold, it's perfection! No need to add any more sugar since I cut the coffee down and add sweetened condensed milk, either. The only complaint I have is what everyone else has noticed as well, that there is a slightly bitter coffee taste.

review/summary: even better than Frappucino -- WOW!!!
review/text: I was very skeptical when first trying the Iced VIA, particularly since, as others have noted, the addition of sugar (and NOT Splenda, alas) to the mix is clearly stated on the package.  Howver, this product turns out to be a huge win for me.  First of all, unlike the regular or decaf VIA which I also love (see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00451WLYI">Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee, Decaf Italian Roast, 3-Count Packets (Pack of 6)</a>), a single serving packet makes 16 oz., not 8 oz -- in other words, you get twice as much.  Second, if you just add a little milk or half and half (I use 4 Mini-Moos for one 16 oz. serving) plus a squirt of your favorite chocolate syrup, it's better than a Mocha Frappucino, and at a fraction of the price for a larger serving than even the large size bottles.  Even throughout the winter, this is my favorite way to start the day.  I'm saving a lot of money by no longer buying Frappucinos, not to mention the effort of lugging a case home from Sam's Club every week.  And the sugar content is LOWER than that of a Frappucino -- even if you add your own chocolate -- which pleases me.  In fact, a Mocha Frappucino out of the glass bottle now tastes too sweet to me.<br /><br />Amazon is apparently getting ready to offer a 50-pack case of Iced VIA, which is fabulous news -- I can't wait!  :)<br /><br />P.S.  To make it easier to prepare, I keep several recycled 16-oz. plastic water bottles in the fridge.  Each time I want a new 16 oz. cup of Iced VIA, I empty one bottle into a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KPH6CK">Arc International Luminarc Working Glass, 21-Ounce, Set of 12</a> with one packet of iced VIA mix and add half-and-half and chocolate syrup, then refill the bottle with tap water and return it to the fridge.  No need to use a measuring cup or fuss with ice -- the chilled water is always waiting for me and makes a perfect iced coffee each time!  Another reviewer does the same with skim milk, a great idea which would eliminate the half-and-half for a better nutritional profile.  Either way, delish!!!

I have never been a huge fan of Starbucks coffee because I have always found it a bit burnt tasting, but the iced via quickly blew that notion right out of the water.  The coffee comes just a little sweetened.  I opted to add 2 french vanilla liquid coffee mates to my coffee and it was perfect.  The powder dissolves completely and easily.  The price looks a little high at almost $6 for 5 pouches, but that makes each pouch $1.25, which is less than what you would pay for the same thing at starbucks.  Also, if you want to save more, you can drink it without the creamer, I have found that it is sweet enough without the creamer to be enjoyable too!I swear by this stuff and recommend it to everyone.  Even my co-workers agree, this stuff is awesome!

review/summary: Very convenient, good taste, a tiny bit too sweet
review/text: I don't like warm coffee, and my iced coffee needs a little sweetener.  This has a LITTLE too much, but the pure convenience along with the cost makes this worth buying for me.<br /><br />From talking with an ex-Starbucks barista, ordering a large iced coffee at Starbucks gets you 16 oz of coffee, the rest filled with ice.  That's what you're getting here, assuming you got a little sweetener when you ordered it in the store.  Works for me.

review/summary: ridiculously strong, ridiculously good
review/text: So strong, so good; I love it. The Starbucks Via Iced Coffee is delicious and packs a kick. Before I learned of this product, I would drink Redbull, Rockstar, and brewed Starbucks coffee twice a day, making it a very expensive habit. Now, I only rely on one pack of this stuff a day (half the pack in the morning and the other half in the afternoon). It is very unnecessary to drink an entire pack in one sitting. I drank a Redbull the other day and was so disappointed when it wouldn't wake me up. I drank half a pack of Starbucks Via Iced Coffee immediately afterward, and felt extremely energized.<br /><br />I would like to mention that if you are an avid black coffee drinker, this "lightly sweetened" instant coffee may be too sweet for your taste (you people are crazy; sugar makes the world happy!).

review/summary: COMPLETELY ADDICTED... and happy about it.
review/text: I only drink iced coffee, and I've always been on the search for instant iced coffee.  People don't seem to understand that iced coffee is NOT the same as hot coffee with lots of ice in it.  In all my years of searching, there was only one other product that I came across at a high-end boutique grocery store which could compare.  However, it was an imported product, way too light, and cost waaay too much.  I bought Starbucks VIA as soon as it came onto the market.  I've already been addicted to Starbucks for years, but this is taking it to a whole new level for me.  To be able to have iced coffee instantly in the comfort of my home is a miracle!!<br /><br />One packet is good for a VERY large cup, and it is deep in flavor, with just the right amount of sugar.  I add 1/2 cold water and 1/2 milk.  Sometimes I'll make a small (almost like a shot) cup, with a lot of powder, and it is practically like espresso.<br /><br />THANK YOU, STARBUCKS.

I got it in less than a week (for me a record via APO), and works perfectly with the ubiquitous 1-litter water bottle. Everything is in one simple package (includes sugar) just pull the easy rip tab pour into a 1-litter of cold water bottle, shake and perfect coffee every time!<br /><br />My only complaint is you can only buy is boxes of 5 packets, if it came 50 pack i would buy that instead...

review/summary: Better than the gourmet coffee shop
review/text: I used to spend a ridiculous amount of time and money going down to my local coffee shop just to get iced coffee.  I brew my own hot coffee at home and love it but it never turns out the way I like it when I try to drink it iced.  This stuff is incredible!  By adding just a small amount of cream, this tastes even better than the $4 iced coffee I used to have to wait in line for.  I have heard several people say that it's too strong and/or too sweet for their taste.  I usually get my large iced coffees with one sugar and this has about the same.  Using a regular glass seemed to make this too strong for me even (and I like my coffee strong).  I now use a pint glass and it's perfect!  I recently started taking this to work in an Avantro travel mug and I have ice cold coffee that will last me till lunch. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FL23RM">17oz One Mug 3.0 tumbler style with rubber grip ring.

review/summary: finally easy iced coffee
review/text: I love iced coffee but I find it hard to make it well. This makes a nice, very strong cup when made according to directions. Simply add to water and shake (stirring tends to not mix it completely and you end up with some settled at the bottom). I like to mix it in half the amount of water then add milk for the rest of it. No need to add sweetener as it's already sweetened enough to me. Makes for a delicious cup in a fairly short amount of time. As far as drinking it without milk or creamer, I find it hard to do. I can drink hot coffee black, but iced coffee is not as easy, and this is no exception.

review/text: Now, this stuff is quite delicious at first, but becomes a little cloying before you're half done. Just stirring it in a glass is barely enough to dissolve the sugar crystals; vigorously shaking it in a bottle is easiest. I find that I can easily stretch a packet past 16oz, and watering it down helps with the over-sweetness. It is however, a far cheaper alternative to my iced coffee each day, which I'm very grateful for.<br /><br />If they ever create a low sugar version at the same cost, they'll likely have a lifetime customer right here.

review/text: The Starbucks Via Iced Caramel is gross. I can't even stomach my first glass of it. I'm a HUGE fan of the regular Iced Via's and drink them daily. I made this with the same amount of water (1 water bottle) and could see immediately that the color was very pale in comparison. I hardly taste any coffee at all, just an overwhelming fake caramel flavoring and WAY too much sugar. Will be tossing the rest and sticking with the original flavor!

review/summary: Good
review/text: I think the Starbucks Via Iced Coffee is pretty comparable to the iced coffee you buy from Starbucks. It's not as good but you can't expect it to be as good as the brew you get from Starbucks so I'm giving it a five stars. It's good for those who don't want to leave the house for Starbucks, it's good for people on the road, and it's good for people wanting to save some money from having to buy an actual iced coffee from Starbucks. It's very easy to make. I usually put it in a water bottle, add some water, shake, and then put it back in the fridge to kind of let it chill all together. The lightly sweetened portion makes for a good treat. On a normal day however, I prefer my coffee/iced coffee to be unsweetened (because I very much enjoy good coffee on its own and because I don't want all the calories from the sugar) so I wish Starbucks would make an Via iced coffee that was unsweetened. I, unlike some of the other reviewers on here, don't find it to be too sweet though. I'm looking to try to Starbucks Via Caramel Iced Coffee next.

review/summary: Great as is! Perfect with a little doctoring...
review/text: This caramel iced coffee mix from Starbucks VIA tastes almost like ordering the real thing from Starbucks, making this a very convenient and cost effective product to drink at home! The instructions say on the package to add 16 ounces of cold water then add milk to taste. My own recipe is for 8 ounces of filtered water and 8 ounces of milk (i usually use 1 percent, may need less milk if using whole). Then, stir the mix thoroughly until completely dissolved. Now, if you want you can add your ice cubes and be done with it. The drink will taste good and sweet as is! However, if you want to really make it taste good, then I suggest doing what I do. I drizzle some Monin caramel over the top. The caramel usually goes straight to the bottom of the cup, which is a good thing because you can then use a straw to suck up a little caramel with every sip, YUM! The monin caramel can be purchased here on amazon! To top it off I use some ready whip, the stuff that you spray out of a can that you get at the grocery store, and drizzle a little more of the monin caramel sauce over the top of that! The end result is just as good or better than ordering from Starbucks....and of course much cheaper!

review/text: My hubby and I really like Starbucks Via! We make up one packet and split it - ends up being two full glasses. It comes out to be the same price as an iced coffee at McDonald's (usually cheaper for us because we buy these on sale/clearance and stock up). Plus, we can make these up whenever we want. We usually add in some skim milk and shake it up in our martini shaker, then pour over ice. Done!

review/summary: Yummy Iced Coffee
review/text: I'll start by saying that I'm usually not a fan of Starbucks coffee in general, but I decided to try this since I love iced coffee and don't always feel like making a coffee run every time I want some.  With that being said, this coffee is delicious, not to mention incredibly convenient.  I start my day by taking a shaker cup filled with skim milk, a packet of coffee, and an equal or two, shake it up and throw it in the fridge.  Then whenever I want some iced coffee it's prepared and ready to go.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would prefer if it came unsweetened.  Obviously, since I add equal I don't find it to be too sweet, but I don't really use sugar and would prefer if I could just use my choice of sweetener instead.

review/summary: Pretty good, and not at all too sweet for my taste...
review/text: I just purchased the regular Via for Iced Coffee today at my local Starbuck's (they ran a free tall beverage of choice offer today, which encouraged my indulgence; The gal was kind enough to upgrade my tall to a grande and give me an extra Via packet gratis!).<br /><br />I was a little disheartened to learn that they don't offer an unsweetened version (just this regular and limited edition caramel flavor), but opted to take the plunge anyway. As someone who typically drinks iced coffees and iced teas without sugar, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the taste of Via is not at all on "sugar overload". The powder mixed and dissolved quickly and the product tastes just as if you had purchased it from your local Starbuck's barista at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />Would I purchase it again? In one word; yes! With any luck, they'll come out with a unsweetened version soon, which will then warrant a five star rating.

review/summary: What a refreshing pick-me-up
review/text: Sometimes I like to indulge, and an ice cold caffeinated drink often hits the spot this time of year.<br /><br />I like how quick and easy this makes iced coffee. I substitute milk, and after mixing, I add LOTS of ice. It tastes like I got it at a cafe somewhere, yet it is at least half the cost. I don't measure, but after taste testing, I find I have to use my largest set of tall and wide cups (these little packets make a lot of iced coffee for one person!) The first one I made with a whole packet seemed to at LEAST be Venti sized, and that was BEFORE I added the ice. It was crazy big. So I've started to make two servings with each packet, which doubles the value.<br /><br />The biggest surprise: this stuff mixes VERY well VERY quickly. You won't have any grit in your glass at all. And it hardly tastes instant. I enjoy the level of sweetness it comes with. When I bought this, I did not realize it was pre-sweetened, and I was nervous for a moment. I was afraid it would have a really strong sugar or fake sweetener aftertaste. But luckily, the amount of sweetness is perfect! It definitely has sugar, but it is not THAT much sugar. It actually could have been much worse. This is obviously not a health drink! I consider this stuff to be like dessert...<br /><br />The best part of all is that my husband thinks I worked super hard when I whip these up. He's picky, yet even he thinks they turn out perfect.

I literally just got it and am sipping my first glass now - YUMMY!<br /><br />Now, I'm the type that likes her coffee heavily diluted with cream and sugar (and chocolate, if I'm in the mood for a mocha), so I was a little concerned that this might not be sweet enough. I can say that, although not *terribly* sweet, this is lightly sweet and PERFECT!<br /><br />One reviewer mentioned making it with milk - I think I'll try that tomorrow morning (not tonight; I do want to get some sleep eventually, LOL)<br /><br />So, DEFINITELY recommended - and I'm going to buy several more packs once I hit this review's "submit" button *grinz*

review/summary: Gross and WAY too Sweet
review/text: Milk is almost a requirement.  All I pretty much taste is the sweetner.  It barely tastes like coffee.  It tastes weird and like syrup. The packages are sort of annoying because they only tear like 1/3 the way through.  So, unless you don't mind waiting a minute for the stuff to pour out of that small opening you either need to tear it with your teeth or use scissors.

review/summary: Perfect if you like pre-sweetened drinks
review/text: I purchased the Starbucks VIA iced coffee on a whim at my local Starbucks due to it being on sale.  I love it.  I was nervous about the taste at first because it's pre-sweetened and while I do like sugar in both my hot and cold coffee, I don't like the excessive amounts that Starbucks packs into its bottled Frappuccinos at the grocery store.  The sugar content in those are outrageous.  The sugar in these instant iced coffees I can take and I would say it's half as sweet as the Starbucks bottled Frappuccinos, but still may be too sweet for some.<br /><br />There's one oddity about the pre-measured amount.  The directions say to add 16oz of water (and possibly ice), but most standard drinking glasses are just at (or slightly above) 16oz, so if you like milk or cream in your coffee you're going to have a hard time putting the amount you want without the glass overflowing.  Perhaps I'm one of the few that drinks iced coffee with cream, maybe?  I don't know, but it's annoying (lol).  Not annoying enough to rate the product below 5 stars, though.  Next time I may make a small pitcher of iced coffee by dumping several sticks in 48oz of water and then I don't have to worry about it.  ;)

review/summary: NOT "Lighty Sweetened"
review/text: To be fair I prefer my coffee without sugar, but was not terribly concerned with a "lightly sweetened" product.  However, as previous reviews mention, this is 3/4 sugar and is sickly sweet.  There needs to be a version w/o any sugar (or artificial sweetener) since it does seem to "mix" better with cold water than the other variations of VIA.  (or Starbucks could package an iced version with separate packets of sweetener)  For the time being if you prefer non sweetened iced coffee or prefer to sweeten it to you liking steer away from this.

review/summary: Via instant coffee
review/text: As a convenience, this is great coffee.  I do find, however, that is HIGHLY caffeinated.  I made it up in a pitcher that would accommodated 6 servings (recommended number was five) and it did not diminish the taste, but was still quite caffeinated for me.  A good balance of sweetness and blends well with cream if that's your preference.

It's not too sweet..........I only with its price is lower so that I can have several cups a day.<br /><br />I have gone through the whole package(5 packs) in two days, so it will cost me almost $100.00 if I consume three packs a day.<br /><br />I love the taste, but I have to stay with my Taster's Choice for now.  It will be great if an 8 to 12 oz jar is available.

review/summary: "Lightly sweet"???
review/text: What an aggravating product. The package label says "lightly sweet", which sounds perfect, and says that it makes 5 - 16 oz drinks. Checking the Nutrition Facts on the back of the package I see "11 gms of sugar"--sounds reasonable. But when I mix up a packet per directions (in 16 oz.) it was undrinkably sweet. Taking a closer look at the fine print, I discover that although the directions are for one 16 oz. drink per packet, the Nutrition Facts are for "SERVING SIZE 1/2 PACKET and 10 servings per package". My 16 oz. "lightly sweetened" drink contains 22 GRAMS of SUGAR. The packaging is misleading twice over. What could have been a good coffee drink is ruined by our culture's addiction to sugar and corporate labeling practices.

review/summary: Good taste. Too pricey and a little bitter
review/text: Good tasting and a little addictive. I bought it when Starbucks was giving free shipping and now they're tacking on $3 for s/h. That pushes the price up too high, so I guess I'll get it at the grocery store where it is about $7 plus tax.<br /><br />I like to divide these packets almost in half which amounts to about 2 teaspoons which I add to a tall glass of 1% milk leaving room to plunk in about four or five ice cubes. This seems to work for me and doesn't make it taste too bitter. I'm not a strong coffee gal, but this still gives it plenty of coffee flavor. I've followed the directions exactly before making a 16 oz. cup and divided it between me and my hubby. He thinks the strength is perfect, but I think it's too strong. He also likes his coffee black, but I like my cream and sugar.<br /><br />Overall, I think these packets are handy but not the best in the world. Maxwell House makes a good ice coffee. Their french vanilla flavor is very good while the Hazlenut is only okay and too powdery tasting. It is very cheap at $1.80 a box at Walmart. Possibly a little sweeter than Starbucks and you lose all that burnt, bitter taste. No offense to you Starbucks fanatics. Hey, I do love their Mocha and even succumb to paying over $3 for it at the drive through!

review/summary: Great for a quick iced coffee.
review/text: I originally purchased these in my local grocery store and loved them, then searched for the items on Amazon where I was able to purchase a larger quantity for a great price.<br /><br />The Via iced coffee isn't quite as good as if went to Starbucks and purchased it directly from them, and it comes already sweetened, so you don't have the option to customize your drink with Splenda, etc. However, if you're looking for a quick iced coffee it's a great find. I have a Keurig and to make iced coffee, even with the iced coffee pods - I either have to drink my coffee ice cold and watered down or slightly warm. You don't have to worry about that with the Starbucks via, it's a powder, so you can have ice cold coffee without having it get too watery.

review/summary: I absolutely love it
review/text: I am so excited to see that Amazon sells the Starbucks VIA Iced Coffee! I never thought to look before now, and have been ordering it direct from Starbucks and paying their exorbitant shipping charges. I sucked it up because I have to have this coffee. I am not a fan of hot coffee, but I am an iced coffee junkie. I have been known to double fist the 32 oz iced coffees from McDonald's, I am that ridiculous.<br /><br />When the Starbucks Via Iced Coffee came out late last year, I couldn't wait to try it.  I first drank it just with cold water and ice.  It is already sweetened, so we are good to go there.  I missed my sweet, milky iced coffee from McDonald's, so I had to experiment a little bit.  I tried adding a little skim milk.  That helped, it tasted even better.<br /><br />Then I bought a gallon of 2% chocolate milk, and put a bit of that in instead of the regular milk. Oh my gosh! I have a better tasting iced coffee (in my opinion) than I can buy at any cafe.  It is so delicious, and I look forward to it every morning.  I think this VIA is made to be mixed with milk, it is strong so that the rich coffee flavor shines through even with milk mixed in.  When I run out of chocolate milk, I use skim milk with a good squeeze of Nestle Quick syrup, a good alternative.<br /><br />I have been trying to find a good iced coffee to make at home for several years, and this is it...I was brewing whole pots of hot coffee and trying to add ice and vanilla syrup, and coffee creamer...bleh, it was so much work and tasted half as good as this!  Give the VIA a try, you won't be disappointed!

review/text: I live in Kazakhstan and, unfortunatelly, we don't have any type of vanilla beans in our supermarkets. Plus, most of the companies simply do not have delivery to our country. Friend of mine was visiting US and I've ordered the Vanilla Beans from Arizona Vanilla Company to his temporary address. But, unfortunatelly, my parcel hasn't been delivered by indicated time and I've contacted Arizona Vanilla Company for their assistance. They found out that the parcel has been lost and offered to ship new order. I've explained my situation that friend of mine has already left US and that I live in Kazakhstan. Despite the fact that they initially do not ship anything to this direction, they kindly offered to do an exception and ship it to my home address in Kazakhstan!

review/summary: I made some impressive vanilla ice cream with these beans
review/text: I used one of these beans to make some fresh vanilla ice cream last Monday night.  The recipe came from Season #1 of "Good Eats", Churn Baby Churn.  2 cups of half & half, 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup sugar, a little pure fruit pectan, and one of these beans.  Heat the cream to 170 degrees, mix in your other ingredients well, then kill the heat.  You now have "ice cream batter".  Pour the batter in a sealed container, and place the container in the Frig for 6 hours.  After 6 hours, get out your ice cream maker and churn for about 30-35 minutes.  I find longer is better.<br /><br />Alton Brown put up a little notification prior to a commercial break stating that Madagascar beans are the most sought-after despite the fact that the Mexican beans are more flavorful. Regrettably, the only source of vanilla beans in my hood is Williams-Sonoma, and they only carry the Madagascar beans.  Those do make for a delicious vanilla ice cream, but I didn't want to pass on the opportunity for more flavor.  I decided to test Alton's claim by ordering some these beans.<br /><br />The results are pretty sensational.  I pretty much mopped up the floor with some house guests last.  They loved the beef bourguignon and the Paella I made, but the vanilla ice cream afterward knocked 'em dead.  Let's just say they were flabbergasted.<br /><br />Make some vanilla ice cream.  You will like the results.<br /><br />Is Alton correct about Mexican v Madagascar beans?  I don't know about that.  I think the Mexican bean is the far more familiar flavor.  If you are an American, you grew up on the flavor of the Mexican vanilla beans.  This flavor has the home field advantage.  The Madagascar bean is more exotic.  It has a coffee-vanilla kind of flavor.  I like them both.  I think I will cut half a Madagascar and half a Mexican bean on my next batch, and see what the combined flavor is like.

review/summary: hate tea? you might like this
review/text: My husband can't stand most tea. Green tea, black tea, mint tea-- all of it tastes like weeds to him. However, this summer while we were in Japan, we went to a ramen shop that put out carafes of iced tea. Being too thirsty to wait to wait for someone to flag down and ask for water, he went ahead and gulped some of the tea down. Twenty minutes later, I notice he's not bothered to ask for water. I thought you hated tea? "I can drink this."<br /><br />Fortunately, my mom's been drinking Rooibos for 20 years now, so I didn't have to desperately find someone who spoke English to find out the name of the miraculous tea that was deemed ok to drink. I just needed to remember to order some when I got home. All of the tea shops around here sell it mixed with fruits or other herbs, and that wasn't going to fly. I was very pleased to find a reasonably priced case of organic straight Rooibos here.<br /><br />I use three bags to brew a little less than 1.5 liters, and then keep it chilled in the fridge. It's really helped cut down on soda consumption around the house. My mom has been drinking Port Trading Co Rooibos, but said she thought she liked the taste of this one better.

This was a good choice, but if you are expecting a typical black tea flavor, you will need to give yourself a chance to make friends with this flavor. I am on my third box of it & am now addicted. I could definitely take a tea break several times a day with a pot of this brew. And, it's caffeine free so that is a plus. Would definitely purchase this again.

review/summary: Pretty good, but very different
review/text: I tried this Rooibos tea on a recommendation and although I find it pretty good, it is very different from anything I've had before.  The overall quality of this product appears to be outstanding and the flavor is strong.  If you are a fan of this flavor I would guess this brand is a very good one to go with.<br /><br />11/07/2011 - Update.  After the first few bags of this tea I became addicted so I'm finally making my rounds back through to update my review from 4 stars to 5.  This really is a great product and the flavor, albeit different, grows on you in short order.  I use a mixture of regular table sugar and Stevia extract in mine because I'm trying to cut down on my sugar intake, but still have that sweet tooth and prefer my tea and coffee sweet.  I have found that I can't over steep this tea and usually leave it in for 10 minutes minimum; however I typically place a single bag in a 16 ounce cup.  Sometimes I even leave the tea bag in the cup while I'm drinking it and have never experienced the bad taste you get from over steeping regular tea.  If you like it really strong you might want to stick with an 8 ounce cup, but keep the 10 minute steep time for full flavor and antioxidant benefit.  For those hot summer nights, reduce the water to 10 ounces (or less) and pour it over ice after it is done steeping.  This flavor is really good hot or cold.<br /><br />11/13/2011 - Update two.  I tried to save a few dollars and decided to purchase the loose tea this time around since it is about half the price.  Unfortunately the brand I purchased (Davidson's) lacks the body and flavor of the Choice brand.  When brewing the loose tea I placed 4 teaspoons in my brewing basket and everything else was the same as what I used when brewing the Choice brand as mentioned above.  It just wasn't the same experience.  On the next brew I added an extra teaspoon and it still wasn't the same.  This tells me the quality of the Choice brand must be really good!  I might have to pay extra and just keep using the bag tea.

Regardless, this tea is delicious and great quality.<br /><br />I love this brand:<br />*Fair Trade Certified<br />*Organic (USDA Certified)<br />*Their facility is powered with renewable energy (via RECs)<br />*Individual teas wrapped in unbleached, biodegradable packaging<br />*The only thing not biodegradable is the outer plastic wrapping, which can be recycled with other stretch plastics (such as grocery bags).

review/summary: Awesome taste and color, hot or iced.
review/text: I have not tried any other brand of Rooibos tea, so I relied on the reviews before I bought it. It is a bit higher-priced  than others, but well worth it.  I will buy it again.

review/summary: Support Jane Goodall by Drinking This Tea
review/text: Rooibos is our favorite variety of Choice Organic teas - we love that it's caffeine free, it has a gorgeous ruby-orange color and just the right blend of fruit tartness and sweetness. And every purchase helps to support Jane Goodall's work. A great Christmas stocking stuffer.

review/summary: Smooth, rich, tasty & healthy too. My favorite Rooibos tea!!
review/text: I have grown to adore rooibos tea. Choice Organic's version is more flavorful by FAR than others I've tried. The fact that it is produced organically is comforting. No nasty chemicals!<br /><br />FYI: Red bush tea (Rooibos) is quite different from black or green tea. Less tannins provide a very smooth mouth feel. Contains high level of antioxidants & flavonoids (cancer fighters). Free of caffeine. Used medicinally in Africa for centuries. Discovered by Europeans circa near 1772. Substantial health benefits with studies to back it up. Also nice for facial skin.<br /><br />Amazon's price for the 6-pack is approx $8-9 less than others I found which makes mama a very happy shopper.

review/summary: Second time buying
review/text: I love red (ie. rooibos) tea.  It has a woodsy flavor that doesn't get overly bitter like most teas.  Plus it's caffeine free and full of antioxidants.  During the colder seasons, I drink about 4-5 cups of tea every day.<br /><br />This is my 2nd purchase of the Choice brand.  The tea is strong and not filtered down.  I can use 1 bag twice.  If my eyes are tired, I take the used bags and put them over my eyes when I'm in bed and my eyes are refreshed the next morning.<br /><br />Red tea is also great with a bit of honey added.  The honey makes it more of a refreshing kind of tea that would taste good iced as well.

review/summary: Give It Some Time
review/text: I drink green and black tea like a fish drinks water; which tends to lead to one problem--caffeine overdose. To compensate, I add the decaffeinated varieties. That works, to a point. I Need a change every so often, ergo Rooibos. This tea smells like the stuff you pull out of a clogged drain at first (at least to me) and tastes like black liquorice mixed with grass clippings. Here was the deal for me. I stuck with, it started to smell...okay and taste alright. About 2 boxes in it still smelled off but it was tasting quite good. I just placed my second order. I can't explain it, but, at least for me, repeated exposure to the tea actually made it transition from awful to enjoyable. So, you may have to give it some time.

review/summary: good tea, terrible packaging
review/text: I'm trying to maintain a healthy amount of daily caffein-free, sugar-free liquid intake, but plain water gets a bit boring after a while. Rooibos tea is great: fragrant, convenient, and it's even supposed to be anti-oxidant. The only problem is that the packaging of this product is ridiculously annoying. The plastic is very difficult to peel. I had to struggle with it for like 5 minutes, even with the help with my swiss army knife. Had to take one star off.

review/summary: OK, I'll give it three stars. The first review was one star.
review/text: I gave this product one star the first time around but I think I figured it out so I'm now giving it three stars.  When I first received the 6-pack of this tea and opened it up it smelled like sewer sludge. The expiration date is over 2 & 1/2 years away so perhaps this is a very fresh shipment.  After a day on the countertop the smell subsided quit a bit. I poured the boiling water over a bag and let it set for about five minutes.  When I placed my honker over the cup its smell was still very strong but it also started to subside very quickly.<br /><br />The taste reminded me of dirt so I gave it a packet of stevia which made it drinkable unlike the first time I made this tea.  I was surprised at the smell and taste after about half way through the cup.  It now seems very pleasant and drinkable.  I might move it up another star or two after I get use to it.

review/summary: delicious- excellent for salad dressings
review/text: A nice choice for making salad dressings.  It has a slightly "thicker" feel than other oils and therefore stays blended well with a creamy texture.  Avocado oil has a mild flavor and while more flavorful than canola or olive oils, it is not overpowering.  (It sometimes hardens a bit like olive oil does when you refrigerate it, but it quickly warms up and blends when shaken.) Use it with some balsamic vinegar and either Good Seasons Italian or Basil Vinaigrette mix for an easy and delicious "homemade" salad dressing.

review/summary: Watch Out for Package Size!
review/text: First of all, let me be clear that I really like this product. It's yummy and the price is good. The reason for the one star rating is that I have been reordering it for quite a while. I reorder from my shopping list, so I don't read the description carefully, since I am just re-ordering exactly the same thing I've gotten before (or so I thought). This time, the bottles were half the size, but the price was the same. I looked at an old bottle (actually, can) and noted that it was 16.9 oz. This time, the three cans were each 8.5 oz! Now, the description clearly says 8.5 oz., so I can't complain about that, but it came off my shopping list, which always before sent me three 16.9 oz cans. So, bottom line is just be careful if you've ordered this in the past and be aware of what you are getting. It's still a good value (just not a killer deal, as it was before!)
