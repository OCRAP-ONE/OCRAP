review/summary: DELICIOUS!!!!!
review/text: Happy Pho is addictive!  I prefer not to use the flavor packets and create my own dishes.  One of my favorites is a spicy noodle soup.  We use organic chicken stock, add ponzu, asian fish sauce and soy sauce, put shrimp, pork or chicken as the meat (or all 3) then add green onion and top with Bean sprouts and slivers of serano chilis (once cooked as a garnish).  It is so good! I may add some chili oil for more spice but the overall flavor is excellent. The texture of the noodles are one of the most delicious attributes to Happy Pho.<br /><br />We have created several unique dishes over the noodles.  One standout is a fresh sea bass that was pan seared then placed over the noodles.  The noodles were flavored with chicken stock, chili oil and a touch of white pepper.  A medley of veggies were garnished and this was a huge hit with my family.<br /><br />I love this product so much that I am giving Happy Pho to my friends and family for the holidays!

review/summary: My Dream Product
review/text: I came across this product on Amazon while scouting for healthy Asian products for my cooking show.<br />I was so thrilled to find and tried Happy Pho.  Happy Pho is my "dream Vietnamese product".  What makes Happy Pho my dream kitchen product/condiment?  Firstly, because our family loves eating Pho, we don't mind eating Pho every few days (especially when it's chilly outside).  Pho is the stable food in our home and I believe it is in most Vietnamese homes too. Secondly, Happy Pho is my "dream comes true product" because not only it made with the best ingredients for its kind (i.e. gluten free, brown rice noodles, organic spices, low sodium, and no MSG),  but it's also tasty and easy to make.  Lastly, Happy Pho is very low in calories per serving and it's even "printed on 100% recycled paperboard" :). If you want a more fancy Pho, I would recommend adding your favorite vegetables, baked tofu, or grilled chicken for more nutritious nutrients.<br /><br />I am a Registered Dietitian, therefore I know the great benefits of eating complex carbohydrate/high fiber foods such as Happy Pho, especially something that you eat on a regular basis.<br />I hope that Happy Pho will continue to make more similar Asian products as Happy Pho that are tasty, healthy and are quick and easy to make.<br /><br />I'm planning to buy more Happy Pho for myself and for my friends and family to try as well.

review/summary: helps to satisfy my pho craving
review/text: For a number of years I lived in Arlington TX and ate Pho several times a week at the numerous Vietnamese restaurants there. But, now I'm about two hours away from any place that serves it. So, I bought this to hopefully get my Pho fix. I had to experiment a bit, rather than exactly follow the recipe on the box, but you can achieve a reasonable substitute for restaurant Pho with this product.<br /><br />Different people will have different preferences, but here's how I've been using Happy Pho. Since I like beef better than chicken, and more broth than noodles, my stock is made from 6 cups of water with 3 chicken and 2 beef bouillon cubes per Pho spice packet (instead of the suggested 4 cups of chicken broth). Then, I only use 1/2 to 2/3 of a package of the brown rice noodles. For meat, I toss in about 8 pre-cooked frozen beef meatballs and several beef cold cuts.<br /><br />I do follow the recipe on the amount of cilantro and ginger, but also add a couple of chopped up green onions. After that's all combined and cooked, serve it with spinach leaves, bean sprouts, and chopped up fresh serrano peppers on the side. I always add quite a lot of sriracha sauce, because I like the soup hot and spicy. (This also helps if you think you used too much broth for the amount of Pho flavoring provided.) Some hoisin sauce can be good, too.<br /><br />This works pretty well for me until I can travel somewhere a more authentic version of the dish is served. I have also tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PBM598">VV Foods Vietnamese Beef Pho Noodle Soup Spice, 1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a>, which is another decent variation on the Pho spices - you get 3 spice packets per box. The same recipe above seems good with this product, as well, other than you may need an extra cup or more of broth.

review/summary: Not so good.
review/text: My family lovees to eat pho and since we are on a gluten free diet, we decided to try Happy Pho since it got rave reviews. We were so excited when the box came on our front porch but our excitement was short-lived. The spice packet was awful. It tasted old and bitter (alot of cardamon). I don't mind cardamon, but it tasted off. On the plus side, the noodles were good, but it is awfully expensive to buy it just for the noodles. We bought fresh ingredients as suggested and squeezed alot of lime, but it didn't help any. We ended up throwing away the spice packets and used the noodles to make other things.

review/summary: Not Very Easy
review/text: I want to amend this review a bit by saying that the maker of this product did e-mail me some tips on how to make the most out of the food on limited supplies after I originally posted my review. I appreciate that.<br /><br />I'm constantly looking for easy to cook, healthy meals. For some reason I thought that this would be as easy as cooking Ramen. I suppose it's my fault that I missed the part where it mentioned "fresh ingredients" on the product's amazon page. However, I did see where they referred to it as "easy." This is basically a starter kit that requires you to have a lot more ingredients (bok choy, spring onion, tofu or chicken, cilantro, broth, etc.) in order to get the full pho experience. If you're willing to put in the effort, I bet it tastes pretty good with all the ingredients that don't come in the box. It's pretty good on its own too.

review/summary: Got a lot of compliments
review/text: I gave this to my in-laws along with custom ceramic mugs for Christmas. My mother in law LOVES coffee and we're always bringing her some back from wherever we vacation. She LOVES this coffee. We have two coffee shops in town (Austin, TX) called The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, so she thought I bought them locally. I sure hope my purchase supported the same company, but I'm not sure. Either way, she LOVES this coffee, said it was perfectly balanced strong flavor with smoothness. I had a cup the other day and have to agree. She loves it equally in the coffee pot and in the French press. It arrived quickly and was packed very well. I'm thinking about buying some for myself when we run out. I don't drink coffee at home all the time, but when I do I only drink the good stuff and always French press. Not sure I need two bags of it but at this price it's easy to buy two and give one away, share the love. :)

review/text: When we lived in calif we went to Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf all the time for our coffee. But since we moved out of state we'd been trying different coffee places without finding one we liked as much as Coffee Bean. So I ordered their French Roast on line and we were both thrilled to find it was even better than the House Blend coffee we'd always gotten from Coffee Bean. I make it with one scoop per every cup of water and it's great! It's strong but not too strong and tastes good with just cream. So this is our new morning coffee now.

review/text: I had never tried Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf before, as that chain is not local to me, but I had heard good things about it. This looked like a good deal and I'm so glad I took the chance because it's great coffee. This roast is a nice dark roast with some depth and a hint of sweet smoke, very easy drinking. I take mine with honey and it's fabulous that way. I think anyone who takes their coffee without cream would enjoy this. As a French Roast it's not as intense as some other brands out there. The closest I've tasted to actual French Roast in France (yes I have been there) is Joffrey's. Coffee Bean & Tea is not that smoky but I don't mind because it's delicious in its own right. This deal gets you a two pack of 12 ounces per pack. Highly recommended.

review/text: This coffee has a very middle-of-the-road kind of flavor. It's certainly better than Folger's or Maxwell House, but there's nothing really interesting or remarkable about it.  I'll probably save it to serve to crowds at events or big parties or maybe when I'm in the mood for a flavored coffee I could add flavor to it. Nobody will complain about it, but no one is going to really rave about it either.<br /><br />The benefit of the bland base is that its' a nice palette on which to add cream, cinnamon, chocolate, etc.

review/summary: Puttin' on the Ritz !!!
review/text: Ritz crackers by Nabisco have always been one of my favorites. I remember eating them in kindergarten at snack time--I always wanted a couple extra! These crackers have stood the test of time because they are very tasty and great to eat as a snack.<br /><br />Ritz crackers are rather low in fat (4.5 grams of fat per serving) and they have almost no carbohydrates. They are cholesterol free as well--hooray! In addition, this product is kosher if that matters to you. The nutrition label indicates that there are no trans-fats but I did notice a bit of partially hydrogenated ingredients on the label--it may be that the amount of trans-fats this generates is negligible.<br /><br />Ritz crackers can be eaten by themselves but feel free to get creative! They can help out when it's time to make snacks for company. Just put a bit of cheese (or melted cheese and ham) on them and you're serving up great appetizers or snack in no time! They go great with a little bit of butter on them, too.<br /><br />Overall, Ritz crackers really hit the spot when I crave a snack before bedtime. I simply take a slice of two of regular cheese and place little bits of the cheese on top of the crackers and with a small beverage it's awesome!<br /><br />I highly recommend Ritz crackers as one of the healthier crackers that will satisfy you, too. Great!

review/text: This tastes decent. And leaves you full longer. BUT, these people are over charging you.<br />Its $2.99 in most stores (NYC). HERE as a bulk purchase on amazon it is $3.10 per can. Which comes to way more money per can when you add in the shipping costs.<br /><br />Not Worth the online purchase price. I, like you, thought bulk meant cheaper.

review/summary: Inconsistent product
review/text: Can't say it feels good to write this.<br /><br />We first ordered this product about 2 months ago and the first box of 20 bones lasted us that long because it was very densely packed rawhide. Each bone lasted approximately 2-2.5 hours of constant chewing. Needless to say we liked the product and reordered it. Unfortunately the the new box is completely different from the first!<br /><br />First of all, the bones in the second batch have a pinkish/brownish hue to them as if they're coated with something for flavor. Instead of a densely wrapped single layer of rawhide, the second batch has ball-shaped pieces of rawhide wrapped by a single layer of rawhide (imagine peas in a pea pod). The bones are very light in comparison to the previous batch and my dog literally goes through them in 15 minutes!! He threw up the "ball" parts one night and his stool became much softer since we gave him the new bones.<br /><br />I'm going to try and return the new box to Amazon and reorder to see if maybe there was a mixup. I'll update my review accordingly.<br /><br />--------<br />April 2011 update:<br />Well, Amazon was great and I was more than impressed with the service... they instantly shipped me a new box! The box we received had the same types of bones as we received in the second shipment which we weren't happy with. So unfortunately we'll have to find a different source for rawhide bones. By the way, since dogs are sensitive to changes in their diet, I decided to experiment and let our dog have these new bones and see if he'll get used to them with time. Several weeks have gone by and he still has softer stool when we give him the bones, he also has diarrhea because of them once in a while. When we don't give him the bones his stool is a better color and is nice and firm. Sorry, didn't mean to get too graphic, just trying to give as many details as I can.

review/summary: Keeps my "aggressive chewer" happy and entertained for over an hour
review/text: I've bought other products, like Macho Stix, and my Bernese Mountain Dog--young, slightly hyper-active and a very aggressive chewer--makes short work of them.  Even a "long" macho stick would only last him about 15 minutes. Alas, he's completely indifferent to all plastic bones, sterilized cooked bones, and other substitutes for rawhide.<br /><br />A single Green Cow bone lasts him about a hour and half.  Great entertainment and mental exercise--when he's done, he plops down very contentedly for a nice long rest, all hyper-activity expended.  He's in no danger of choking because there are no "knots" on the end that he can swallow whole.  (We watched  him very carefully the first 10 times we gave him one, but he chews the pieces up very carefully and slowly).<br /><br />He ADORES these bones! He gets three a week and we make the most of them--makes him very motivated when we do obedience training, for he'll jump through hoops to get one of these!  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Wow!
review/text: These are the best-built retriever rolls we've seen in years. They appear to be constructed all in one piece and are densely constructed. We have an 80-pound dog and a 105-pound dog, both avid chewers. The smaller dog will get only a few inches into one of these in a day -- she'll chew, nap, chew, look out the window, chew ... and the bigger dog, who is more food-motivated, will have one of these last him at least a day. If there is one criticism -- I wonder if the rawhide isn't a  bit too thick, even for our large dogs. Time will tell.

review/text: My dogs have sensitive stomachs and it is hard to find a rawhide brand, that is well made consistently (right temp, no weird ingredients or preservatives, made in US or Argentina and not China) enough to buy in bulk amounts.  The only thing I would complain about, but this company is amongst the most consistent, is that rolls when you look at them should be rolled entirely through to the middle...  Again, this company is way better than most but I'd like to see 100% on this :)

review/text: Forget all the plastic chews, other rawhide that both retriever/hounds went through in hours.  My only 'criticism' is that I am forever finding pieces of them, half eaten after days, or a quarter left in the strangest places... under the bed covers, in the couch cushions and definitely the occasional barefooted 'find'... ouch.  But dogs never tire of them, never get sick on them, they play silly 'ownership' games... one will have two or three of them and the games begin as to who gets to steal who's!  Really the best dog chew toy I've had and I've had many over the years!

review/summary: Good bones, but possibility of small pieces breaking off
review/text: My 4 month old GSD puppy very much so enjoys chewing as she is teething, and these bones have saved my limbs from the wrath of her puppy teeth! That being said, she has been able to chew pieces of these bones off and get them semi- stuck on the roof of her mouth. Because of the possibility of having sharp small pieces, this is probably a product that is best used while you are near your dog so you can hear/see if they are breaking small pieces off.  Other than that, this is a good product for the teething puppy (although probably not for a really small puppy).

review/summary: great chews!
review/text: We have two beagles, both of whom love to chew on things. We go through a lot of raw hides to keep them busy. Out of the dozen or so brands we've tried, none have lasted longer than a day, regardless of the manufacturer's claim. Our beagles can go through a raw hide in about 2 hrs, even the tough braided ones. These are the first raw hide bones that are lasting longer than one day. They're averaging one to two bones each per week. I think these raw hides are rolled A LOT tighter than other brands. Plus, we've noticed zero splintering. As a quick side note, the bones come packaged inside a cardboard box, from the manufacturer (which works for us as they are easy to store in the pantry.)

review/summary: Look inside... These rolls are hollow!!
review/text: When you pick these retriever rolls up, and hold them in your hand, they feel very lightweight. I didn't think much about it until today, when I decided to saw one in half so that my dog could have a quick chewy treat. The outside the roll looked perfect -- they appear to be densely rolled rawhides. But, upon looking inside the roll I discovered that THE ROLL WAS A HOLLOW TUBE!<br /><br />These rolls are very deceptive. You could give hundreds of these to your dogs and not realize that there is very little rawhide in them.<br /><br />Whoever rolled the hides simply rolled an external hide once around two thin strips of rawhides into the end of the rolls to make them look like a long length of hide had been rolled up tight (imagine a thin coil of rawhide neatly stuffed into each end of the roll). To make matters worse, there seems to be some kind of spray foam used as an adhesive to keep it all together.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and find a high quality US rawhide company that ships to your local pet store.

review/summary: Super dog chews
review/text: I have a strong chewer who is just weening off her puppy years.  We recently moved and were unable to find a place reasonably near us that had chew "bones" that were long enough, and thick enough to satisfy our strong chewer...  We tried Petsmart on line and paid a lot and what we got were hollow bones with knots at the ends!  Our dog went through them within half an hour  and she was looking for more! I felt like it was a huge waste of money because it barely did what we needed it to do!  (keep her happily chewing for hours)  So, I kept looking on line...  I saw these here on Amazon, they're more costly than what we're used to buying, but caved due to our dog's need for them.  They're tightly rolled - some are ticker than others.  She goes through one a day - they're lasting anywhere from 2-6 hours, depending on how active she's been that day.  There was one that was so thick she had trouble chewing it - she is still working on that one now and then - I am NOT displeased! hehe!  We subscribed to them, then decided to get a second box (subscribed each month just until she calms down on the chewing enough where we feel like we're getting enough each month) because they're working out SO well!!!  Both boxes were the same quality.  Tightly rolled rawhide, the dogs are doing great on them (the older one just likes to hold it and have it near him... lol our younger one is the strong chewer)<br /><br />Both of our dogs are mutts.  Our older one is beagle/basset mix?  and our younger one is redbone coonhound/boxer or American terrier mix?  She's about 80lbs of doggie muscle and chew jaws; she's chewed on many things as a puppy (but she tries to be good lol)  She's slowing down now that she's 2 years old.  I include these details so you can see if her chew habits match your fuzzy friend :)<br /><br />We're completely satisfied with these "bones"... all 4 of us :D

review/text: After being pleased with my first order of these rawhides, I set up a recurring order for them. We received a box last week and were disappointed to find that the quality of these bones is not the same as the first order. The first order of bones contained rawhides that were tightly-rolled and long-lasting, but these have inner layers that are brittle and easily broken. One of our dogs actually cut her mouth or gums on the brittle shards--we didn't realize it until we saw blood on the bone itself. Amazon is refunding the purchase price. I may try one more time with this brand. If anyone has found a consistent quality brand at this kind of price, please let us know. Maybe my budget is the problem...

review/text: My two big dogs love to chew on anything and if I don't have rawhide bones laying around my shoes will get eaten. I thought this was a great deal and I was very happy with my first shipment. However, my second and third shipments were disappointing. The bones seem to crumble when chewed on leaving a huge mess in the house, I'm having to vacuum twice a day just to be able to walk through the house. The third shipment of bones smells badly and my oldest dog who has never had problems with rawhide started throwing up after eating a partial one. Needless to say they aren't getting anymore of these bones and I will find another brand that is consistent in the quality of bones and a lot less messy!

review/summary: Keeps my dog busy
review/text: My border collie came from the rescue with a lot of warnings about chewing, especially on soft things.  I now get a box of these rawhides delivered as a subscription, because they seem to do a good job of soothing her chewing fixation (along with plenty of exercise and attention and a few other fun toys).  It's nice to have a stack of them to reach into whenever I'm heading out the door and need to keep her busy.<br /><br />I chose these mainly because they don't have knots on the edges that can come off small in bits, and I throw them away when they get small.  I haven't had any problems with variations in the type or quality of the product with each order.  However, my dog has gotten an upset stomach when she's eaten quite a bit of them on an empty stomach (usually when she's waiting for breakfast).  I think this is something that happens with rawhide, and taking them away when there's going to be a longer-than-usual wait between meals seems to solve the problem.

My dogs (I only have two now, the others have gone to puppy heaven)love these rawhyide bones and the vets says their teeth are skeaky clean.  Even the one that was thirteen years old had teeth in perfect condition.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone that doesn't live close to a Sam's or CostCo.

review/text: This product is great for Pez lovers, such as myself.<br />However, my overall rating for this product is not a 5-star review.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />I ordered this product a couple, few times.<br />Out of most of the bags of Pez, most of the rolls contained broken Pez.<br />Most of these rolls contained Pez that were all broken.<br />This is a major inconvenience if you're going to be stocking your Pez dispensers with these.<br />Hopefully this was just bad luck on my end though.<br />Also, the price was a bit higher than what I was looking to spend.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The bag contains a good variety of flavors.<br />These flavors include:<br />Cherry, Grape, Lemon, Orange, Raspberry, & Strawberry.<br />(I believe these are all correct)<br />I also like the mini sizes of each roll. They're fun to give out to friends.<br /><br />Would I purchase this product again?<br />Yes.

review/text: I kinda figured I was going to get a ton of the "undesirable" flavored candies. I bought this bag to get the hard to find lemon and grape flavored Pez. I got three lemon, two grape and two orange packs. The whole bag was filled with Raspberry flavored Pez (which I didnt even know they made) some Strawberry and some Cherry flavored. I bought another bag for my daughter who isnt picky about her flavors in the bag, but other than that, ill look for an allternative choice for my next Pez purchase...

review/text: I do a lot of cooking and I was always running out of parsley until I started using the Spice Hunter Organic Parsley Flakes. I keep a stash in my pantry and now I never run out. This dried parsley is organic and once it has been added to a stew or pasta sauce, it is difficult to tell that I didn't use fresh parsley. It is conveniently packaged in a pack of six tightly sealed bottles which stay fresh for several weeks at a time. This is one of those pantry staples that no chef should ever be without. Also wonderful sprinkled over salads or a perfect topping for garlic bread.

review/summary: Stronger than I expected
review/text: I have been using Torani Sugar Free (Splenda based) syrups for a while and I really like the Chocolate and Hazelnut flavors, so I thought I would try the Peppermint.  I make iced coffee at work - coffee over ice with some milk and a shot of Torani for sweetener.  I recently bought the three pack of Peppermint and I have to say: it's very strong.  The peppermint flavor can easily overwhelm the coffee or the flavor of the milk.  I'm not saying it's bad, per se, but it's quite a bit of flavor and I don't really want to overwhelm the flavor of the coffee.  So I think for mornings where I want the peppermint flavor, it'll be a very small shot of the peppermint, and a packet of regular splenda to add more sweetener.  I might normally use 2 teaspoons of the chocolate or hazelnut but I think that's too much with the peppermint.  Torani makes these in plastic bottles - good for shipping, and don't break if you drop them.

Haven't tried it yet, but since it's made with Splends, not sugar, you probably could get a nice peppermint bath!  Haha. Weird. As a coffee flavor it is very nice!  By the way, the bottles are plastic, not glass, in case you were wondering.

review/text: I've been hooked on the Torani Sugar Free Vanilla syrup for years.  With the holidays prompting Starbucks and McDonald's to offer peppermint drinks (which I really like), I thought I'd try Torani's peppermint at home.  It seems to take a bit more syrup than I was using with vanilla, but I really enjoy it.  But, the bottles are a bit bigger so it's no big deal.  It has replaced vanilla on my subscribe and save with Amazon!

review/text: I purchased this product to add to my peppermint cream coffee during the holidays and it was perfect. 0 calories with great flavor. I ended up using less creamer and splenda while adding lots of taste. If you love a sweet peppermint drink, this is the guilt free way to achieve it. The three bottles lasted me about 2 months and I would use it a couple of times daily, but there is a distinct possibility that I used more than most people would because I love my coffee extremely sweet.

Just make sure you have the crushed oregano, chopped onions and fresh limes handy when you open the can, and some crushed dried red chile is good for a little extra heat too!

review/text: I have been drinking Tulsi(Holy Basil) for several years now not only for its wonderful musty, clove-tinged taste(especially blending tulsi with peppermint and stevia) but for its reputed mood stabilizing/adaptogenic qualities (read the book co-authored by David Winston for more info). Many of the usual places I buy tulsi were out so I tried Amazon. I have enjoyed Tao of Tea products in the past but this stuff was garbage. Not only were there a large amount of sticks/stems in the product but the tulsi itself was totally tasteless with a distinct odor that was unlike any tulsi I had ever tried. Even infusing the tea at triple the strength I usually use (1 tbl. per 6 oz of water) did little to improve the weak character of the product. The only thing about my order that was any good was Amazon.com listened to my complaint and sent me out another 1 lb. of this tea no questions asked; unfortunately the second bag was just as lifeless as the first. Worst purchase from Tao of Tea that I ever made.

review/text: I really love this Tea, it energizes and relaxes me. when I drink it in the morning I feel really solid and ready for anything afterwards. I have read about this tea and it does have many health benefits as well. another great thing about this tea is the way it is in the bag, it is thick leaves and assorted stems and that there tells me, that this tea is the "real thing" and not some over processed junk that you would find at typical grocery stores. Also, getting this much Tulsi Tea (one pound) for this price, is a very good deal. To me, this tea has a rich and smooth taste.<br /><br />Tulsi Tea has been around for thousands of years in India. Also known as Holy Basil, Tulsi is a sacred plant from India used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. Revered in most households, Tulsi is considered an "elixir of life" providing alchemy to one's well being.<br /><br />Tulsi contains antioxidants and has adaptogenic and immune enhancing properties.  Tulsi's traditional uses: Reduces Stress,  Promotes Calmness,  Balances Metabolism,  Strengthens Immunity.<br /><br />Flavor Profile<br />Sweet, cooling, earthy aroma reminiscent of basil, mint and cloves.

Joesph's Sugar Free Cookies are a real find!<br /><br />A pack of about 10 cookies has more than 150 calories, and upwards of 20 or so net carbs so you do have to be aware that these can have a glycemic impact. I usually ration myself to 4 or 5 cookies per serving for less than 100 calories and 8 or 10 carbs.<br /><br />All of the flavors in this assortment are good, but I really liked the Lemon and Chocolate Walnut best.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: I'm not diabetic - just trying to make peace with my dentist and bathroom scale.<br /><br />My assortment only included 3 flavors but the most popular 3 it looks like (choc. chip, choc. brownie, and shortbread, all with nuts). All taste excellent. The cookies have a nice oven-baked flavor to them (vs. the brownies). I think these taste better than most of the regular big-name cookies, and one pack is just 150 calories or less, with 7.5 g of fat. Love the portion control, and there's quite a few cookies for that few calories!<br /><br />Since consuming most of these, I went to Joseph's website and ordered lots of different flavors of regular-sized bags of cookies. If you buy $20 (US) worth there, shipping is free!<br /><br />I've decided I definitely prefer the baked taste of the cookies, and can do without the brownies. I haven't tried the cakes yet. So far I like all the flavors I've tried, but with the nut and coconut cookies having so much flavoring, I've been happy to also have the nutless chocolate chip cookies (without any strong flavors) as sort of a default option. With so much flavor, I find it easy to eat a few cookies at a time - rather than half a bag ;-)...
