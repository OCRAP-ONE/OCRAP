review/text: This Korean-style ramen is one of my favorites. As an individual whom doesn't often eat spicy foods, the spiciness of the seasoning in the ramen is very near upper tolerance level and nothing goes better with it than a cold beer. The texture is a bit chewier than the generic American ramen but that's what ramen should taste like.

review/summary: The best go-to meal for anything!
review/text: This is the best hangover cure you can buy.<br /><br />That being said, I've been eating this ramyun ever since I was little. It is great just the way the package tells you to eat it. Sometimes, I'll just make it by pouring hot water over it, and the noodles are still a little crispy that way. You can also make this really fancy. Stir in a can of tuna (flavored or not!), some vegetables, leftover meat of any kind...you can make this into a really great and filling meal! I just wouldn't recommend adding rotisserie chicken (that was the saltiest thing I think I've ever eaten...).<br /><br />I love this stuff and I don't think I'll ever stop eating it. The price on Amazon is alright -- if you have an Asian market nearby, it is cheaper there. Some Walmarts will also sell the individual packs for about $1 each, so Amazon doesn't really save you any money, but it does provide convenience if you have Prime.

review/text: I was introduced to this ramen 15 years ago while overseas in the ROK. Its a spicy Korean ramen comparable to some of its Thai counterparts but has to be one of the tastiest ramen noodles I've ever had. The quality of Nongshim is superb and I would recommend this product to anyone. Add an egg to this noodle soup while its cooking and you got an awesome meal.

review/summary: Good noodles
review/text: Good spicy ramen,and when purchased through Amazon, pretty cheap. In NYC you can't really find these in bulk at these prices (under a dollar per soup with Subscribe & Save) unless you go bargain hunting at the Asian markets. I still have most of this case left, so I'd imagine one case is good for 6 months, if you're a relatively light eater of freeze-dried ramen.<br /><br />You can add all sorts of things to hearten this ramen up: eggs, spinach, tofu, kimchi, bean sprouts. This ramen IS salty (and moderately spicy), so you can add extra cooking water and dump it out after serving, or half the seasoning packet.

review/summary: Spiciness Overpowers Flavor
review/text: I began looking at Amazon's offerings of ramen noodles because I was tired of Top Ramen and the few limited brand varieties most stores carry. I settled on Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun Gourmet Spicy Picante because of the high ratings. I don't mind spicy foods, but sometimes I find that when food is overly spicy it overpowers any appreciation for the flavor. This is my experience with Nong Shim noodles. My dh, who enjoys ramen noodles says these noodles have a slimy texture and I did have to agree with him the next time I tried to "get in" to them. However, I'm still curious about Nong Shim's other ramen noodle offerings so I may purchase one of their non picante flavors.

review/summary: Serving suggestions - 3 basic ones.
review/text: 1. Add an egg while your noodle is being cooked. The timing decides whether the yolk will be soft or hard. To preserve the original spicy flavor, the egg should be hard-boiled in the soup. But some prefers to blend the soft yolk to the soup for a milder taste. There are a lot of people who blend the whole egg to the soup during cooking, this makes it a wholly different kind. Note, as more egg blends into the soup, you are more inclined to finish the whole soup, which is not too great for your health (too much sodium).<br />2. Add a slice of cheddar cheese on top of the prepared Ramyun in a bowl.<br />3. Do both 1 & 2.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars because Shin Noodle is too spicy for me.

review/summary: Sooooo Goood!
review/text: I could not wait to get this noodles in the mail and right when they arrived, I whipped up a bowl and could not have been more satisfied. I love spicy foods and not only does this satisfy my craving, but it's also full of flavor. The possibilities are endless when it comes to adding ingredients to this ramyun, but even if there is nothing added, it is still very good. I really like the packet of freeze dried vegetables that come with it. I have half a box left and I already know that I will be ordering more if I can't find something similiar in the grocery stores in my area.<br /><br />To address the sodium issue - yes, there is about half your days worth of sodium in one flavoring packet, BUT you most likely won't be able to handle the heat of one whole packet so you won't be consuming the full amount of contained sodium and if you do use the entire packet, just watch your sodium intake the rest of the day and double your water intake (you will probably do that anyway to cool your mouth from the heat, but it's a good burn :)). These aren't incredibly healthy. My boyfriend and I usually split one because there is a lot of noodles per package and it is so filling. You do not want to eat this for several days in a row, but a lot of things are okay in moderation. I whole heartedly believe that one package of these noodles is a heck of a lot healthier than anything offered at a fast food chain.

review/summary: tasty, but loaded with sodium and better prices locally
review/text: This is probably the #1 Ramen in Korea which I also enjoy, but you should be aware of the nutrition facts.<br /><br />The nutrition table on the bag is for 1/2 a serving, which equates to 1/2 a bag.  The cooking instruction is for full bag, so it's fair to note the nutrition contents for the whole bag as below:<br /><br />Calories: 560<br />Calories from fat: 160<br /><br />Total Fat: 18g, 28% of daily value<br />Saturated Fat: 9g, 46% of daily value<br />Sodium: 2080mg, 86% of daily value<br /><br />While the sodium content is on the higher end of foods, you have some control over this by adjusting the amount of power soup base.  Once I learned the nutritional facts, I use the full bag of noodles with half packet of the soup base.  The other method would be to cook the whole bag as usual, but immediately throw away 1/2 the soup to avoid the temptation of eating the whole thing.<br /><br />Lastly, my secret to best ramen is no secret to Koreans - after the noodle is dropped in boiling water for 1 minute, drop an egg and sliced spring onions and cook for 1 more minute.  Then, pour into a bowl by 3rd minute.  You'll know you did this correctly when the noodle in the bowl is "almost" 100% cooked where the noodle have come apart, but still somewhat undercooked.  If you cook more than 4 minutes as instructed on the bag, then the noodles will get bloated and taste nasty by the time it makes it to the table.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: These are, by far, the best Ramen Noodles I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  I practically lived on this stuff when I was in college.  A packet is included containing the spices which allows you to control the level of heat in the dish by adding more or less of the contents to the noodles.  One important note, the spices provide a tasty spicy hot, not a hot-just-to-be-hot flavor.

review/summary: Very spicy, plenty of flavor.
review/text: As far as packaged ramen goes, this stuff is about as good as it gets.  I haven't found any other ramen that I like as much as this.<br /><br />Most ramen I eat as drained noodles sprinkled with the seasoning packet, but this one is much better as a soup.  The seasoning is far too spicy to eat these noodles dry, but the seasoning packet is perfect for seasoning soup.  Other types of ramen don't make the kind of flavorful soup that this one makes, but there is enough flavor in one packet of this stuff to flavor a LOT of water!<br /><br />A word of warning... this soup is VERY spicy.  I regularly eat hot wings, spicy potato chips, and I put extra hot sauce in spicy chili.  I like spicy food.  But this stuff is pretty harsh.  If you're very sensitive to spicy foods, I would avoid this one.  If you're mildly sensitive to spicy foods, just use a little extra water in the soup.  I wouldn't say this stuff is over-the-top spicy, but it has a pretty strong kick.<br /><br />I think the thing I like most about this type of ramen is how flavorful the noodles themselves are, even when they are made as a soup.  When I make ramen as a soup with other types, the noodles are almost flavorless.  But these noodles really soak up the flavoring very well.<br /><br />The one complaint I have is that I don't care for the vegetables that come in the vegetable packet.  Fortunately, they are separate, so I just don't put them in.  I find that they don't get soft enough, and I don't like the texture or flavor of the vegetables.

review/text: I bought these in preparation for long nights during finals week with the thought that they may be more interesting than the typical chicken ramen noodles. I like spicy food too, so this seemed like an interesting trial for me, although a bit of a gamble when ordering a whole case. These noodles are fantastic, they have so much more flavor than typical ramen, and in many ways are much better tasting than the typical meals i eat. They a slightly-moderately spicy, so i can still give a pack to a friend who isn't into spicy food and expect they will still enjoy it. Ton's of flavor, a bit more volume, and no MSG like normal ramen noodles. Highly recommended.

review/summary: thick chewey noodles
review/text: The big problem with most instant noodles is that the thin noodles get soggy and mushy when sitting in a bowl of soup, then loose quickly their flavor. These thicker noodles avoid that problem and are tasty until you finish the whole bowl. Yes, the soup is spicey, but you don't have to use the whole spice packet if you are a wimp. Just be careful if you are on a diet, since one package if 500 calories (the "per serving" label is for less than half a package).<br /><br />4 stars instead of 5 because instant noodles have so much fat and salt. Regular dried noodles are much healthier, if don't mind waiting a few more minutes for them to cook.

review/summary: Good Price, Spicy!, Different Aftertaste
review/text: I first got these because I was looking for something hot, something yummy, you know... a quick snack or a fast meal for when I was in a hurry.  I had fond memories of rice and noodle concoctions from my student days and I was drawn to these because of the many excellent reviews.  Indeed, after reading some, I fully expected my toes to tingle after eating these!  :)<br /><br />At first I really liked them, and yes, they are truly spicy.  I like spicy.  The spicier the better.  Besides, the reviewers are right- you can just put in as much of the spice packet as you want.  After a few of them, though, it occurred to me that the spicy wasn't like any Thai or Cambodian food I've had, or even straight up hot chilies like habaneros; the spice struck me as more chemical-induced.  Was it the MSG?  The other salts?  Whatever it is, it doesn't settle well with these taste buds.<br /><br />The more I ate, the less good they seemed to me.  After a while, I noticed that they always left kind of a gummy, coated feeling to the inside of my mouth.  Then I looked at the ingredients.... Maybe it is all the MSG, or maybe the beef tallow, or maybe all the sodium variants that I can't even pronounce.  Whatever it is, these are losing their appeal with every serving.  Now, I'm not a health foodie and despite the fact that one package doses you with 88% of daily value of sodium and 40% daily value of fat, I'm not holding that against it.  (to be fair, the previous amounts assume that you use the entire spice packet and each package counts as 2 servings)  It really comes down to that gummy feeling left in my mouth after eating a package, even using 1/3 of the spice packet.  I just can't get past that.<br /><br />The noodles seem like any other ramen noodles, and they are yummy.  It's also nice that they have a decent size packet of dehydrated veggies inside, separate from the spices.<br /><br />Taste is totally about preference, and I don't think this is a bad product just because it didn't work for me.  Also, I think they are priced right, especially if bought through subscribe and save.  I've got to go with my experience on the rating, though.  Though I won't be getting these again, I wouldn't steer people away.  I would suggest, though, first looking at the ingredients list to see if you are cool with what's in it, and also get a few to try before committing to a bulk buy.

review/text: I can't speak to the these noodles being genuinely Korean. I can only speak to my personal experience with them. I find them absolutely delicious! They are my favorite quick meal after a hard days work where I don't want to spend a great deal of time cooking and I even enjoy them as a comfort food when feeling a little down.<br /><br />The quality of noodle is definitely greater than your typical Maruchan ramen you find in the grocery store. That being said, this is no gourmet meal. If you're looking for something quick and cheap that doesn't taste like garbage, you found it. Those who don't like spicy food should not purchase them, however. They do have a kick, but nothing extreme.<br /><br />If you want to reduce your dishes, try steaming the noodles by boiling water on the stove. Put the dry noodles and dry flavoring in another bowl with a lid. Pour boiling water on top of the noodles and close the lid. Instant noodles in about 10 min.<br /><br />And one warning: always rinse your bowl out when you're done. Never ever leave it sit out for more than a day. You'll only do it once before you figure out why. (Stinky!)

review/summary: Nong Shim Ramyun
review/text: Definitely better than the cheap ramen you find at the grocery store. A dollar a packet really isn't that steep, and you realize this when you try them. First off, the packets are noticeably larger than other ramens, with quite a bit more noodles. Then there's the fact that it comes with a spice packet that seems larger and more filled than competing ramens. It also comes with a dried vegetable packet, a very nice touch. Make sure to read the instructions, they're a little different then other ramens (you just place everything in at once and cook). The taste is phenomenal, nice and spicy (especially if you add the whole packet) with firm noodles that are more chewy that "normal" ramen. A very nice Asian spicy flavor. If you are not one with hot/spicy foods, consider using half a packet of seasoning. Definitely a must try, and I will be ordering more in the future!

review/summary: Ramen connoisseur's delight!
review/text: My iPad has been in Netflix mode since Korean Drama was added to my que.  Watching "Boys Over Flowers" inspired me to buy some ramen noodles.  Since I live close to the Korean Market I stopped in for some Shin Ramen.<br /><br />Just finished a bowl made exactly as directed.  Results:  Delicious!  Behind the heat the noodles definitely have flavor.  About 3 bites in I had to add some water to the broth.  I was on fire!  But I am not a heat person.<br /><br />Next time I will Dr. it up with some salmon, shrimp and green onion....it's great with ramen!

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: It's not bad, the quality of the noodles is excellent, the packet comes with a good amount of flavor powder so you can pick how hot you wanna make the noodles. The full packet is pretty spicy, half the packet is better for my taste. It's a good product.<br /><br />Two negatives for me were:<br />- Not my kinda flavor, maybe you'll like it, I thought it was a little bland, spicy but bland, I want to try their other flavors later though cause the quality of the product was excellent.<br />- Really high in sodium.

review/summary: Two Tastes - Salt and Red Pepper - yet I like it. Add an egg and it really improves. Unfortunately it is far from healthy
review/text: Don't under estimate the appeal of salt and cayenne (red) pepper for many "soup lovers" and reviewers. That includes me.<br /><br />However, this is nothing more than a watery Noodle Soup with lots of Red Pepper and a tremendous amount of salt. Add an egg and it tastes much better. Chop up some scallion and it further improves.<br /><br />There is nothing terribly impressive about this soup YET I like It. This dry soup mix consists of a large packet of noodles (essentially tasteless yet ladened with 500 calories of saturated fats) and two much smaller packets. One of these small packets contains less than a tablespoon of chopped dried vegetables and the other is a "spice" packet consisting largely of salt, msg and red (cayenne) pepper.<br /><br />Add some water and you have 2 1/2 cups of soup.<br /><br />Impressions: Beyond the watery base (there are no thickeners), my first impression was that of salt followed ---- after a few more spoonfuls -- of the emerging heat of cayenne pepper. As is typical with cayenne pepper, the heat builds up on the palate over time. Some might call this soup "medium hot" but for many I'd imagine they would call it "very hot". However, it easy to adjust the heat level - just add less of the salt/spice packet.<br /><br />But the only real tastes here are those of salt and cayenne pepper. The noodles are essentially tasteless and the vegetable packet is so small that it can add nothing more than visual appeal. However, I'll say it again, don't under estimate the appeal of salt and cayenne pepper!<br /><br />This soup can be greatly improved by cracking an egg into the mix and stirring it in during the last minute of boiling. The egg not only adds a much needed third taste but also thickens the soup considerably. I was quite surprised how much an egg improved this soup. Make no mistake - adding an egg really changes the character of the soup.<br /><br />At the [...] I paid - with shipping - for a case of 20 -- this soup was a good value.<br /><br />I'd give this soup 3 or 4 stars with an egg but I'm a bit biased toward anything "hot". Maybe 3 stars with an egg is most appropriate and 1 or 2 stars is more accurate for this soup without an egg?<br /><br />HEALTH WATCH: One packet of this soup provides almost 90% of an individual's daily allowance of salt!!!!! That is a stunning amount of SALT. Plus this soup has 40% of the daily allowance of SATURATED fats (thanks to the palm oil used to fry the noodles). With almost 500 calories, you'll be adding a few inches to your waist line if you eat it regularly. It is shame the company choose palm oil to fry its noodles in (presumably to save a few cents) and added so much salt. It makes this soup needlessly unhealthy. It is, in fact, a poster child for all that is wrong with processed foods. I have to add the ingredient list is truly frightening with a long list of chemicals - far more than is typical - even in processed foods. This is probably not a soup anyone should serve more than once a month. View this soup as equivalent to a bag of potato chips, no more or less healthy.<br /><br />Another HEADS UP - some of the reviews on Amazon strike me as a bit suspect: There are a number of 5 star reviews generated by One Time ONLY Amazon reviewers. Once these "reviewers" have promoted this company's product - they never publish another review. I've seen this same pattern, time after time, for all the other soups made by this particular company.<br /><br />Finally, everyone should keep in mind how hard it is to believe that any dried soup with a tiny "flavor packet" could ever rate 4 or 5 stars among people that have a serious love of soup. Consider too, the simple fact that very few of the soup's ingredients are even readily identifiable as a "food".<br /><br />My thanks to the previous reviewers who suggested adding an egg. It made a world of difference<br /><br />THIS SAME SOUP IS SOLD in CASE LOTS OF: 20 PACKAGES, 30 PACKAGES or 40 PACKAGES. ALL OF WHICH ARE LISTED SEPARATELY ON AMAZON. The prices differ on a package by package basis too. Generally the 30 pack, which ships for free, is the better value.

review/summary: Not bad, will compare to Korean Shin
review/text: Giving 5 stars so more people will read, actually rate it @ 4 stars.<br /><br />From what I can tell, American made Ramen is worse in general<br /><br />For unknown reasons, even though I cook with the same pot I would in Korea, perhaps it is the stovetop instead of the gas stove I would use in Korea, the ramen is harder to cook to the right degree, probably meaning that the noodles were prepared differently in the factories.<br /><br />As for the spiciness factor, anybody who eats regular asian / indian hot foods should be able to taste the flavor behind the spice. In my opinion, everybody here complaining about the whole spice packet being too much must have grown up on hotdogs and hamburgers, or equally not-spicy foods.<br /><br />A tip when cooking the noodles is to cool them in air while the noodles are boiling. Repeat until you see noodles become firmer, perhaps about 5 fork/chopstickfulls for the whole bowl (alot of noodles per utensil-full) and you can taste the difference.<br /><br />As always, eggs, garlic, ground red pepper, sri rancha(?) sauce or other condiments are good.<br /><br />In Korea the standard for cooked ramen would include 1egg, green onions, sometimes onions, and sometimes small dumplings.<br /><br />Red meats are okay to put in, but are less cost-to-taste effective when compared to hams or dumplings.

review/summary: great raman if you dont put as much water in it
review/text: I was expecting spicy noodles and I was originally disappointed. You buy a pack of Maruchan chicken noodles and you get chicken flavored noodles. A pack of Shin noodles sits in a screaming hot spicy broth (soup?) that runs off when you pull out a bite. The noodles you get on the end of your fork are left mostly flavorless after the broth runs off. This then leaves you with a bowl of screaming hot spicy broth, not a format that I enjoy.<br /><br />BUT - I have found that if you don't follow their "soup" directions and instead add just enough water to hydrate the noodles you get quite a different experience, the noodles retain all the flavor and there is no broth. I just ate one of these for breakfast and I am thinking about seconds, these are really quite good in this form.<br /><br />I'm increasing my star rating from 3 to 4 and considering renewing my previously cancelled subscription.

review/text: This is a great ramen. It contains a vegtable packet along with the soup/seasoning mix.  It is on the spicy side however in my opinion it is not over the top spicy.  Has just enough heat to be noticable and if you drink the broth you will get the full effect of the heat. These packets also make a slightly larger portion than your standard Top Ramen and Maruchan ramens. I nomrally make this with egg whites from two eggs. If you like ramen, you would not be disappointed with this product.

review/summary: The best packaged ramen
review/text: I've tried 20 to 30 different products - these are the best available. They are a bit salty, and spicy, but that's not always a bad thing and sometimes really hits the mark.  They are easy to make, have good instructions on the package, and are of excellent quality.  I think they are definitely worth the price, which is higher than many similar products, and can easily be doctored up a level with the addition of some onion, chive, or egg.<br /><br />Also, and not a small matter, they are made in USA, which I think means less concerns about food safety and labeling accuracy.<br /><br />Upside - taste, quality<br /><br />Downside - prepackaged ramen is generally not the healthiest thing you can eat, and this product is no exception - it has 44% of the daily allowance of sodium, and 8 grams of fat, mostly palm oil.  All things in moderation!

review/text: After reading the rave reviews about these noodles for months & months.. I finally took a leap of faith and ordered me up a box... and I was not disappointed! Now, I love noodles of all kind, even the cheap ramen, but these noodles are fantastic! Definitely a more hearty texture to the noodles and the spice has got some serious kick! For those who don't like spicy, I would recommend starting with maybe 1/2 of the pack of seasoning & working your way up, but for me, the whole packet is perfect! I've been adding fresh veggies, an egg or two & some shrimp to these noodles & it makes enough for two people easily! I'm sold & will definitely continue to buy these noodles! Worth the extra $$ :)

I have sampled up to 30+ different kind of bagged noodles in the past 4 years of college and these hands down top the chart. Although slightly more expensive compared to other TOP, Maruchan ramens. It is however worth the price. I'd definitely recommend these to all those want to try something slightly heavier taste.

review/text: I like the Nong Shim Shin ramen better than the much-less-expensive grocery store ramen  because Nong Shim is hot-spicy instead of just salty. You can add veggies/meat/egg/shrimp as extras and the result will still be spicy. This makes it a good sink for your least favorite veggies or leftovers.<br /><br />The product has a reasonable calorie to fat ratio but is not particularly low-calorie itself.<br /><br />Sometimes I pour out most of the water and eat the noodles and seasoning as a snack in lieu of potato chips or crackers.

review/summary: Not as good as the Korean Shin
review/text: This is an incredible product, and to the few reviewers who felt the noodles weren't as good as they remember them: as far as I can tell, there are two versions of Shin.  Like other reviews on here mention, I got these noodles at my local asian market and they were awesome - thick, springy noodles that put regular ramen to shame.<br /><br />I then saw Shin at my "regular" grocery store, and picked some up - big difference.  The noodles were thinner and had no "bite" to them, nothing like the ones that turned me on to this brand.  I opened up one of the packs I got from the Asian market to make sure, and they're definitely different noodles.<br /><br />So, maybe the ones I got at my regular store came from a bad batch etc., but it seems more likely that there's an "American" and "Korean" version, with the ones sold in American stores using a noodle that's more like what Americans are used to.<br /><br />In any case, see for yourself: the product is hot, spicy and incredibly flavorful.  A great buy regardless of the noodle.  But if, like the rest of us, you fall in love with these noodles and find yourself craving them, head down to your local Asian market to try the Shin they sell there.  It's a bit better, but both are head-and-shoulders better than the 10-cent ramen bricks most of us know as ramen.

review/text: I like this product because there's only one ingredient--Pears! And they're also soft.  I don't like really crunchy foods and biting into a "real" pear isn't something that I do.  This way I get the benefit of eating a pear.  And it tastes good too.

It feels slightly heavy in the mouth and even heavier with creamers. EXCELLENT kick back cup! I'd give it 5 stars but that's reserved for GREEN MOUNTAINS Blueberry coffee. Order a few bags and AMAZON pays the shipping.  PEACE

review/summary: GREAT DOG FOOD, GREAT PRICE!
review/text: At first I tried this because of the price and free shipping. I had never heard of it before.  My 11 dogs love this so I say it is great! The tiny ones (toy poodles) get the almost straight food. The others get this mixed with their Bil-Jac. I am impressed with the ingredients. Not full of corn! Another thing I noticed... Every time I have fed my dogs any brand of straight canned dog food, with the exception of Science Diet, they had diarrhea. Not with this one. Not even one of them had it. That's a good thing. I ordered two more cases and will continue. The price is reasonable too and free shipping with Amazon Prime or free shipping with purchase over 25.00.The only fault I could find, in my opinion, is that the product has lamb.  I won't eat lamb and have never before bought any dog food with lamb or veal in it. I do not like the way the animals are treated and lambs are sweet, baby cuddly things. It makes me sad.  Unfortunately, this company uses lamb in most everything for some reason.  I have never seen this before in a dog food  product. They might have one or two items with lamb, but not most all. They do have the chicken and rice without lamb. Regardless, at this time , I plan on ordering this dog food monthly for my dogs as they love it so much and other than lamb, I am impressed with the ingredients.

review/summary: Suspecting change in formula, but still good product
review/text: I've been purchasing this product, as well as the grain free salmon for a few years now by the case. I have 6 special-needs' rescued Greyhounds and although they all require a different 'diet' because of their problems, I keep this on hand in these two grain free 'flavors' as an occasional 'add in' to the fresh-food diets I prepare for them on a daily basis. I have relied on this to get me through their 'picky-eater' times, their 'on-medications-that-taste/smell-funny-and-I-don't-wanna-eat-Mom" times, their upset tummy times, their 'post-surgery-feeling-icky" times as well as when I don't plan right or run out of something. This grain free product comes in very handy and I like that it is pretty close to 'natural' ingredients. Frankly, there is another brand I would prefer but I simply cannot afford it.<br /><br />I've been more than happy with this product because it is grain free. I cook fresh, whole grains for my 'kids' in their daily diets so to find grain free canned food to keep on hand for 'in a pinch', I like this. ok, so I loved it until the last 6 cases I had delivered. For years, this canned product was almost solid in the can. I needed a spoon to dig it out and I loved the way I had to actually mash it into the rest of their food. The last 6 cases (both flavors: 3 of the salmon and 3 of the ALS) seem to have a change in the recipe. I open the can and can literally POUR it into their bowls. There might be one larger blob of 'food', but for the most part, it is like a healthy soup. I purposely do not purchase the other Canidae canned foods that contain broth because I can make them all kinds of much healthier 'broth' on my own. I don't know if these last 6 cases are this way because they sat in a warehouse for a long time and the food actually broke down or what. To those in the 'know' that may sound dumb but I have no idea why this product would change so drastically and I have to admit I'm disappointed greatly. While this is something I can afford, my disappointment is now to the level where I'm back to considering the more expensive product I wanted all along. I'll just buy less of it, less frequently. Too bad. I really liked this one for quite a while, as did my 'kids'.

review/summary: I searched high and low until I found Mrs. Grass noodle soup...
review/text: I've used Mrs. Grass noodle soup all my life, my mother used it too.  I moved to Suffolk, VA last year and couldn't find it anywhere; store clerks looked at me strangely when I asked for and described it.  A friend suggested I look it up in Amazon and there it was, I quickly ordered it.<br /><br />Mrs. Grass soup mix comes in a set - two packages glued together for a total of 8 cups of soup.  However, I've learned to "stretch" and enhance it by using six cups of water instead of four and adding two tsp. of chicken bullion.  I also add a 1/3rd of a cup of dehydrated vegetable flakes and extra noodles as well as left-over cubed chicken and suddenly, I have a nutritious, delicious homemade soup that lasts for several meals. It's far better than any of the other packaged soups out there, partly because of the little gold ball of chicken fat.  I'm delighted to be able to purchase it. Amazon is the place to shop.

I have lived in Utah for the last 29 years, and for the first 20 years, I went without because they don't sell it here. Then I found it on-line. I also send it to my parents in Florida because they don't sell it there, either. I raised my grandchildren on it, and they always ask for it when they come over. Thank goodness for technology, because I would have gladly flown to Chicago once a year just to bring a case of it back with me. :)

My Schnauzers are much better since they started eating this food-the itching and the ear infeections are GONE. They love the taste and I love the very high quality of the food. Some dogs do fine on corn. My dogs do not, and so if you want something like Blue Wilderness at a much lower cost-this is it! Make sure you change your dog over to this food slowly. It is so much richer than Pro Plan or Science Diet etc, that if you change them too fast they can get a tummy upset. Change them slowly and you will be glad you did.

review/text: If your know you go through a lot of marmite, if you spend time looking for the best deal, if little jars make you sad -- then this is what you need. The packaging was excellent. Marmite doesn't go off (my wife still thinks that sounds like a bomb, but if you eat marmite you know the expression of food going off) and this is the most economical deal I found after a lot of searching.

review/summary: NY friend is addicted
review/text: A Texas transplant who erroneously moved to New York City in his hubris, must, on occasion, buy boxes of these to satisfy his insatiable appetite for these delicious beans. Its our little secret here in the South, and I better not see Ranch Style Beans on the shelves of a Trader Joe's or I will ride my Longhorn cow up yonder with a posse and make a ruckus.

review/summary: RSB.  A once great, now on life support
review/text: I get a kick out of the reviews I read on Amazon and I think the bulk of them are honest and posted by regular Joes and JoAnnes.  I grew up in Texas and have lived here most of my life thus far and I also remember growing up being a big fan of "RSB", aka Ranch Style Beans.  I can't really remember a time when we did not have at least one can of the tasty little red colored beans in the pantry, and they went great with most any meal you could put together on a budget, which my mother always seemed to be able to do.  They used to come in a now politically incorrect can which featured the words "Husband Pleasin'" where it says "Appetite Pleasin'" now.  Same face however.  I don't recall who manufactured them then, but a group called Conagra does now and I am sorry I have to agree with the folks who say that the quality and taste have declined a bit from what I recall.  Used to be you got a can full of beans and the sauce was mildly thick and wonderfully flavorful.  Nowdays it seems a bit watery to me and not nearly as flavorful as before and I have even bought a can or two that have been mostly watery sauce as opposed to full of beans.  RSB has taken a hit and nobody seems to care.  I hope Conagra makes the right decision and gives us back the RSB we used to know and love.  Ugh.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I love this juice.  The combination of pineapple and ginger is great.  It is just sweet enough and has a slight kick from the ginger.  Great mixed with carrot juice.  I like to freeze it in cubes and use for smoothies instead of plain ice cubes.

review/summary: Very unique for Jerky lovers.
review/text: I intended this to be a sort of in office joke or at least an in office multi-cultural experience since there are several nationalities working on this current project. As we have an employee from Florida, another From Texas, another from Tasmania (Australia) and another from Leipzig (Germany) I figured this is a basket that could touch home for most of us. I was right, especially with the Kangaroo and Wild Boar Jerky that got a `WTF you're kidding me!' from both our Aussie and German employees. I being from Florida myself liked the Alligator Jerky. The Jerky's themselves are about an above average flavor for each animal in its own right. If I had to grade them across the board I would say these "B" grade Jerky's. Purchase them more for the fact of trying something new and I promise you that you will not be disappointed with the good shock value of the taste. I recommend this as a first try to just about anyone curios as to the variety of exotic meats, I will be ordering another batch soon.

review/summary: Mulberries
review/text: I let my curiosity get the better of me on this one.  The berries are in individual lunch packs so I was paying for a lot of plastic, hence 3 stars.  The berries themselves are quite tasty and well preserved.  I don't think I'll do this again.

review/text: Great snack for a camping trip. I bought a case of 6 and munched on a half-whole packet a day. Not too sweet, fresh, great for an energy-recharge.

review/summary: Very solid bold coffee
review/text: I order this item consistently for my office. Everyone here seems to enjoy the flavor of this coffee. Its bold, and strong, and comes out great from the K-Cup. As with all K-cup products, its not a premium/gourmet coffee from a top roaster and brewer, but it really makes us happy here at work when a K-cup is all that we can produce.
