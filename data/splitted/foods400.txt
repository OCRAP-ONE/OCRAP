review/summary: Cat would not eat it.
review/text: I really cannot give this product a bad review.  My cat would not eat it, so I gave it to someone else and their cat loved it.<br />My cat is an adopted stray that was eating the birds in my yard. I started feeding him Purina Cat Chow in a dish on my breeze-way. Ordered the Newman's so he would get more protein. He just didn't go for it.

review/summary: Chicken and Salmon
review/text: My six month old kitty (Tinker) loves the Newman's Chicken and Salmon moist food. I was buying another commercial brand and even though he would eat some most would be left to dry up and most of the can was being wasted. So paying a little more for a quality organic diet and not a bunch of by-products is well worth it.  Plus the Newman's organic brand certifies that ingredients have been grown on farms that have not used artificial fertilizers or pesticides. I have bought two other flavors of the food but this one is his favorite.

review/text: I have a cat with tummy/bowel problems but not any more! He loves this food and all his irritable bowel problems are over! Also no worries about him eating the chemicals and junk in other foods-obviously things that were causing his problems. Expensive? Yes, but no more vet bills for tummy medicine!

review/summary: great high quality food
review/text: Pros: organic, grain free and a reputable company that gives back to the community<br />cons: my cats needed a few days to get used to this. yes the meat looks grey. but that is because it is all natural.<br />What I do is mix a 3 ounce can with half a can of Wellnes Beef and Chicken. (so its 3/4 meat and only 1/4 chicken) This seems to work. They love this combo. If I just give them the newman's, they eat but don't finish it. Out of all of the grain free beef canned cat foods, I've had the most success with this. My cats didn't like Nature's Variety Instinct or by nature organic. (Both great brands) But its really important to rotate protein sources so that my cats don't develop allergies (my six year old cat recently developed a seafood allergy after only eating seafood for 5 years...) so I push the beef on them.<br />Give it a shot. It might take some work or creativity but eventually you should win. Both my cats are v finicky and I found a way to make it work. Organic beef! I don't even eat organic beef all the time! LOL! ITs a bit pricey but its worth it. Healthy food = healthy cats=longer life=less disease/health problems.

review/text: I have four cats with differing tastebuds/likes.  They all enjoyed this product, and there was no waste.  The supplier sent the wrong size, the smaller 3-ounce cans, but Amazon immediately rectified this in a highly satisfactory manner.  I use the recurring order option for an additional discount, and there is no tax levied on this product (like in stores) on Amazon's site.  I would recommend this product for anyone considering it for their cat(s)

review/summary: Cat won't eat it
review/text: I feel really bad writing this review since I am a big fan of the Newman's Own brand for human food. Their salad dressings are amazing. However, my cat would not eat this product. I purchased the beef flavor because she loves her beef flavored cat treats. I give her organic dry food most of the time, but after talking to some other cat owners, they informed me that I should be mixing some wet food into her diet because wild cats get most of their moisture from their food in nature and don't drink a lot of water. I thought it couldn't hurt to give this to the cat as a treat a couple times a week, but she won't even touch it. I tried mixing her regular dry food into it to give it some texture, and she just ate the dry food around it. I am not sure if this is just a textual preference for my cat or if it is this particular cat food.

review/summary: The best
review/text: I have tried every "good" cat food on the market.  My babies only would eat the dorito's of the cat food market, F**** F****.  Usually chicken sometimes turkey sometimes beef, sometimes I would have to go thru all three flavors until they honored me with eating.... I know, I am a mess.  The two adult babies (6lbs and 17lbs) would eat 4-5 cans a day with dry also available.  The poo was horrible smelling.<br /><br />Wally world was clearing this out one day so I bought a couple cans.  OMG they both scarfed it down.  I went back to get the rest but it was gone.  No longer were my babies interested in the bad food.  This is shocking since I had tried everything after the pet food debacle a few years ago (even tried the frozen meat) and they wouldn't eat anything else.  I only use one of the larger cans a day and their poo smell has drastically lessened.<br /><br />I cant get this local so am thrilled to find it here with free shipping.  I LOVE Amazon, anything I need I come here first and what is better than having your purchases delivered to your door???<br /><br />I cant say your cats will eat this but if they are not hyper picky they should.  (I tried turkey/chicken and no go, has to be chicken rice) And you really DO feed a lot less with this food! I am saving money and getting better food.  YYYEEEEAAAHHHH!

review/summary: Great food, Great price, and no more food allergies!!!
review/text: My cat had the worst food allergies. The way she dealt with it was by vomiting on an almost daily basis. Getting special foods (i.e. Science Diet or Purina from the veterinarian) didn't help at all. Finally I tried Newman's Own dry food figuring it couldn't be any worse. It worked like a miracle! No more allergies and no more carpet cleaning except the occasional hairball. When my cat got older I started supplementing her dry food with the Newman's Own wet food and she loves it. She's been eating this for several years, same flavor and everything, and she still comes running when she hears the food being prepped. If you want a healthy pet don't look any further than this! It's organic and there isn't a single ingredient that I can't pronounce. That's definitely something I want when I'm feeding my cat.<br /><br />The price through Amazon.com is cheaper than buying in the stores and the cans come well packaged and undamaged. I won't be going to the store for this again. Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: the proof in truly in the pudding (Newman's Own- Chriken formula)
review/text: "Only my hair dresser knows for sure,"  Well I don't know about that, but the folks at Amazon know how much cat food I order (on account), both dry & wet foods.  Before I even offered Newman's Own Organic Chicken & Brown Rice formula to my five cats, I could see the difference.  Upon openind the first can, I was so pleased to see real chicken broth (organic of course). It was clear broth just like boiling chicken on stove top. It was really fresh looking too., So then the real test when offering to the three indoor cats.  All three approved.  I given only small portions at one time, yet my kitties cleaned the bowl, eating right up!  Never, ever do I recall when my kitties have been so accepting of their wet food. I've owned and cared for cats for over 25 years, and this food really impresses me! I now order it via "Subscribe & Save" (Amazon program) and it will be delivered at regular intervals.  The first case was damaged in shipment (3 or 4 cans were damaged so bad that the contents were running and dripping from the carton. I contacted Amazon and they were gracious as usual and are sending a new case for my accomodation. The only concern I have at this time is that this particular formula is "out of stock" and currently not available from Amazon, though it can be purchased from WAG.com.  I also make purchases from WAG.com and though their prices are slightly higher (most of the time), they are also a great company and have a good variety of foods for both Cats & Dogs, as well as other pet items.<br /><br />If you've never read Newman's Own QA report and product description, be sure to do so. I think you'll be impressed. I was.

review/summary: Cats Like it
review/text: I have been feeding my cats dry food that is supposed to be minimally processed. I have found that they have been much healthier. Recently I took in my moms cats that are geriatric. I was looking for something minus all the by product and fillers that was a soft food for them. Newmans seemed to be it but at Wal-Mart it was 1.35 a can. I was able to get it here for about 1.00 a can with free shipping with Prime which made a small savings buying by the 24. The cats like it and as I have found with the other dry food they tend to eat less and go longer between feedings before they get hungry again. I am happy with the product and will definately continue to buy in the future.

review/summary: Why the fillers and guar gum? Sigh
review/text: Unfortunately, I can't afford a raw food diet for my cats and they want nothing to do with Felidae, the only affordable truly healthy food that has an ingredients list that makes me feel comfortable. My cats love both turkey formulas of Newman's brand. I always have dry food available which they like but they become vocal to be feed this stuff, they are Siamese so I must do their bidding or the racket doesn't end. I always smell the open product and for six months now, no irregular smells or coloring.<br /><br />Concerns are the fillers that I see in the ingredients, brown rice and oat bran are better than wheat and corn I agree, but it still irks me that a company makes such a commitment to be organic and then uses fillers. Also, Guar Gum makes me a little nervous, though guar gum is one of those fibers that are everywhere, it is basically a thickening agent (think cornstarch) and like any fiber it has its positives along with its negatives. A plus for this brand is that its carried in my local supermarket which is very practical and the price I find reasonable for an organic brand.<br /><br />Since I don't want them to become dependent on any single brand I also feed them Natural Life (same filler issues) which they like but don't love as much as Newman's Turkey flavors. To balance my concern that perhaps there are too many carbs in their diet, I insure that the dry food I purchase is low in carbs such as Before Grain dry food.

review/text: Why didn't I realize sooner that the animals I love deserve food that is wholesome and nutritious?  I recently switched to a top quality dry cat food which I give to our 3 cats daily, but I supplement that with canned "wet" food every 2nd or 3rd day.  The cats have adjusted to this new feeding method and really like their new foods.  Newman's Own Organic Chicken and Wild Rice is a fine product and I've ordered it through Amazon's subscription program so that it is sent to me on the interval that works best, and shipping is free.  A very great deal all around.

review/summary: Great Deal, Great Product, but Confused About Auto-Ship Ordering
review/text: I put my OCD to efficient use in researching the best organic cat food at the best price and this is what I found, and with which I am utterly delighted, BUT for one thing (there's always a thing) -- when I signed up for this auto-ship service it stated that I would be able to change the frequency and duration of my auto-ship order at any time.<br /><br />I LOVE the auto-ship service as it saves 15% and you receive free shipping but I DON'T love doing errands. At all. And especially in these cruel and seemingly-endless winters. It's a fabulous idea and saves running to the bodega in the scary 'hood at midnight when I realize that my princely master (I have learned that the adage -- 'people have dogs and cats have people' is all-too-true, though I am struggling to remain in charge) is out of food. I also seem to really love parenthetical asides, but that's beside the point.<br /><br />Anywho,(here's *that* thing) when I received my first shipment and realized that this was far more than my cat (this is my first cat, a stray whom I had no choice but to take in -- so I am new at cat-ism, previously being a dog person) would eat in a month, I immediately logged in to change the frequency and/or amount of the auto-ship order and it seems my only option is to cancel. This is pesky and bothersome because that leaves me with two choices, as I see it; cancel the auto-ship, or, let the cat food pile up till I have enough cat food to last a year and then cancel. So I give the product 5 stars because my finicky little Prince Wonderfluff loves it and it is healthy and free of the chemicals which are all-too-present in food in this country, but I think Amazon needs to fix the auto-ship options so that when you click on the impending subsequent shipment, you can make such changes to frequency and amount. There may be an existing way to do this but I can't figure it out and I make web sites for a living so I can generally figure out how to do such things.<br /><br />I suppose a third option is to contact Amazon Customer Service but that's not a quick and easy task and I am busy trying to maintain order and earn a living.

It turns out that only one of my cats like it, but the other won't touch it. I'm glad that at least one of them will eat it, otherwise, this would've been a waste of money. Other than that, this product seems to be good, and I like the fact that it's organic.

review/text: I have a senior cat (18 years old) and her teeth are not in great shape.  I switched her to an all wet food diet about 2 years ago, and Newman's is the best wet food that I've found on the market.  She is also fairly finicky, and LOVES the Chicken and Brown Rice formula.  I've tried a lot of other high-end cat foods, some more costly than Newman's, and several of them she has had problems digesting.  Not Newman's!  She really seems to enjoy this food and I don't have to worry that it is upsetting to her delicate stomach.  I've also found that it doesn't have that stench that some other wet cat foods seem to have.  The food is a lot cheaper here on Amazon than in my local store.  Shipping and delivery was fast and pain-free, the box was well packed and none of the cans were dented.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: all three cats love it
review/text: My cats think this food is the cat's meow.  I think that cats who have been fed grocery-store-type foods that have added ingredients, some completely artificial, might need some time to adjust to the natural taste.  But my cats have only been fed higher quality food--most recently before trying Newman's Own they were exclusively eating Doctors Foster and Smith foods.  Even though Foster's is completely natural, it is not organic which is why I've switched.  It's a good feeling to know that I'm doing everything I can to give my cats health and long lives (my Siamese is 21).

review/summary: If You Love Your Cat
review/text: The results we have had since we switched to Newman's Own Pet food are phenomenal. All of our pets look and act younger, their coats are shiny, their noses are wet, and they have a bounce to their step. All natural and healthy ingredients seem to suit them as well, before Newman's many of our pets where picky eaters. Now we have no trouble making sure they get their daily quota of healthy food.

review/summary: Different Consistency
review/text: We have 6 cats and 2 dogs presently and they all get Newman's Own Organics.  The only one we have had our cats walk away from is the 3 oz can of Turkey Formula for cats.  They love the 5.5 oz. can of Turkey and the other two selections.  They also love the 3 oz. chicken and salmon.  The only difference besides the size of the cans is that in the middle of the turkey formula 3 oz. cans there is now a dark pink or reddish colored spot(that was not there originally) that is not in the 5.5 oz can.  All the other dry and can food varieties are very nutritious and are eaten very quickly.

review/summary: confused about this product
review/text: I ordered this product knowing that my cat loves Newman's Organic Turkey formula.  However, he refuses to eat it, and I am concerned that there is something wrong with this batch. I have offered it to him over a several week period thinking he would change his mind, but no luck.  I usualy have good luck ordering from Amazon, but this time I am totally frustrated not being able to speak to anyone.  I would donate the case to an animal shelter, but I am afraid that it could hurt the animals.  You see....I unknowingly fed another pet bad canned food a number of years ago, and there was eventually a recall.  Later she had health problems, and I believe it damaged her kidneys.  It was, in fact, a high quality pet food, so one never knows.

review/summary: Newman's Own
review/text: My cat eats well and has good digestion.  Last spirng I switched her from Science Diet to Orijen, which had been recommended to me by the owner of one of those fancy pet stores in downtown LA.  He said the it was low in carbohidrates and all natural. Within months she began bleeding.  I took her to the vet who recommended that I start feeding her plain canned turkey cat food until they could find out what was going on, which I did.  That episode costs me $600.00.  After a course of antibiotics I went back to Orijen and she immediately started bleeding again so I threw the Orijen out.  I started with Newman's Own six months ago and have never looked back.  My cat is happy with the food and there is no sign of blood anywhere.  I recommend Newman's Own.

review/text: The last 3 cases I've ordered had some dented cans located in the center of the case. I've read other coplaints about this also and wanted to warn potential buyers. The problem is not with amazon but with the manufacturer and how the cans are selected to be stocked inside the cardboard flats. I keep ordering for convenience and love Amazon. My cat loves the product and it is hard to find locally or stocked in a store far away. I sift through every case to make sure the seal hasn't been broken on any dented cans and usually throw away a few. My next case arrives in about a week. If it is dent free, I will revise my review and rating.

review/summary: Inconsistent in product quality
review/text: This is my fist batch from amazon of the salmon and chicken formula. Purchase 3 cases from another pet food store and our cat loved it. When we opened this new one from Amazon, it didn't smell the same as the last batch, this one smelled like rotten fish and the last one smelled good. We have tried to give this new one to our cat and he refused to eat it (when he would beg for the other one and finish it promptly). I inspected both a can from this new batch and a can from the old batch and everything is the same including all ingredients. The only difference I could find was the older batch had a 2014 date on the bottom printed a little differently from the 2015 best by date the the new one....? I don't understand why this product has such inconsistent quality or maybe Newman's is not making the same quality product as they used to. Too bad since I would like to find a organic cat food that is not super expensive cause I'm not going to buy this one again.

I bought a case shipped and sold by Amazon LLC so I got free shipping and a good price. Unfortunately when I tried to buy another case the next month Amazon was investigating a problem they were having with the shipping or something and so I am going to have to look elsewhere for my Newmann's Own cat food until they resolve the issue. I am pretty sad about that but otherwise the cat food is great!

review/summary: I wish this worked with our little darlings!
review/text: I do all the research before buying pet food.  I had high hopes that this one would work with out kibble eating cats as one of them needed to eat food containing more moisture as well as healthy ingredients.  When I opened the first can it smelled and looked good.  I was confident our cats would scarf it up and beg for more.  No way.  They made dainty little burying movements and then walked away.  All I could think of was how much I had spent for such puny results.  Now we are back to using the top grade of kibble and Fancy Feast, which our cats will eat.  However, the good news is that everyone we gave some to from the first case reported back that their cats loved it and they were going to keep using it.  Fancy Feast is cheaper so that is good, but I have no idea what is in the product.  I just trust that our cats are getting enough moisture.  I do regret that we are not using  Newman's Own product since I like their philosophy.

review/summary: Almost a 5
review/text: I love the can size. I can use one per day rather than covering and refrigerating for the next day.  It is great because this food is supposed to go to the cat at room temperature.  Unfortunately,  I believe I checked when I was considering changing to these smaller cans and found that they are more expensive for the amount my cat eats per day than the larger cans.  The only reason I don't give this product a 5 can be remedied by either Newman's Own or Amazon.  I am a prime member but since subscribe and save does not use prime I have to double order.  There are 24 cans so prime once a month (regular shipping time vs. 2 day prime makes it longer than once a month) won't keep my cat feed for the month.  I don't understand why subscribe and save does not honor prime membership.  When customers choose subscribe and save they are giving Amazon long-term consistent business. I guess if Newman's Own packed 40 or 48 cans it would work better with subscribe and save.

review/text: I have two Siamese kittens who are on a mostly all canned food diet. The Chicken & Salmon formula is one of the foods in their current rotation. They seem to really enjoy eating it, although I wouldn't say it's their favorite food. You can see bits of the ingredients (rice?) in the food, and the texture is not too firm, but certainly more firm than a pate-style food. I have already ordered my second case, and plan to order more in the future. These 5.5 oz cans fit the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084E66">Petmate Kitty-Kap Can Cover</a> quite well.

review/summary: I loved that it was organic! My cat- not so much...
review/text: I purchased the Chicken & Salmon formula with the notion that- Hey! I watch what I eat, My kitty should too! Needless to say, my cat Mia was less than thrilled. In fact, she took two wiffs and walked away :( Granted I was feeding her Fancy Feast before- which I recently found out is like feeding your cat Mcdonald's every day! Super tasty but void of any nutritional benefits whats-soever... So after a few unsuccessful meal times, I tried spiking her meal with a dash of Fancy Feast? No dice. She ate the Fancy Feast and I swear gave me this look like- 'Nice Try Bucco- and you thought you were SOOO sneaky...'<br /><br />So to the previous Fancy Feast feeders- I say maybe try something else to slowly get your cat onto the health track? Or you might end up like me with 20 cans of food I can't use :( I've been trying other brands that have more gravy- with slightly more success! (Emphasis on the slightly-she drinks up all the liquid and I'm left with chicken strips!) Maybe I have a oober picky cat? But I'm thinking I will keep on trying and probably give this one another run once I've detoxed her from her fast food craves..

review/summary: Best Choice for my Cats
review/text: I tried literally everything, from high end to low end, before settling on Newman's Own.  The reason?  All of my 5 cats enjoy the flavor (organic turkey) and come running when it is time to eat.  I feed them Newman's Own organic dry cat food as well, so their diet is about half and half.  I have one cat that suffers from IBS. She has to take prednisone daily, so I'm hoping the change in food will improve her condition.  Though Newman's products are expensive, I believe the organic ingredients will make a big difference in my cats' overall health, which in turn will mean fewer trips to the vet and more money in my pocket.  Besides that, I love the fact that there is strict quality control and oversight in everything that goes into a can or a bag, and all the proceeds from the sale of Newman's Own pet food are donated back to animal shelters and the SPCA.  No profit to me means that this company really does have the cats' welfare at heart.

review/summary: Super Finicky Cat Loves It!
review/text: This is for the Chicken & Brown Rice Canned Cat Food Formula<br /><br />My cat (now 15 yrs old) has always been a picky eater.  The only cat food he would eat consistently was Whiskas canned cat food. But alas, they discontinued that product line, switching to pouches and tubs (both of which he refuses to eat).  He will eat 9 Lives from time to time, but it gives him gas and appears to be high in fat (based on the pool of fat when can is dumped out in dish).  I have desperately tried numerous brands and flavors of cats foods for a number of years, but to no avail (Some brands and flavors I could get him to eat for a day or two, but then he refuses to eat it any longer).<br /><br />Then I came across Newman's Organic Chicken & Brown Rice at Dillon's Grocery (owned by Krogers) during a stay in Hutchinson, Kansas and he LOVES IT!  And, it appears to be fairly low in fat, which is a huge plus for an elderly cat with liver troubles (he currently has to be given Denosyl, which is also available on Amazon, to keep his liver in check).<br /><br />For those unaware, a cat with liver troubles is recommended to receive a low fat, low sodium diet, with no fish meal and no organ meat.  I've read online that vets recommend chicken and brown rice blended cat food. So, while I dont know exactly how much sodium, fat, and organ meat this product has (ingredients do list chicken liver, ocean whitefish, and sea salt), it appears to fit the bill (Ie: it doesnt have a pool of liquid fat when put in the dish) and so far my cat is doing well on this product (at long as I continue to medicate him with Denosyl, due to his liver disease - which helps protect the liver and keep the bile production down to a minimum).<br /><br />Unlike most other canned cat foods, he eats the entire can and begs for another!  Today he's eaten every bite of FIVE of the small 3oz sized cans!<br /><br />Ounce to ounce, it's a little more expensive than some canned cat foods, but well worth it in my opinion, especially since none of it is going to waste (whereas with other brands I have been going through 3-5 5oz cans of the other brands of cat food, twice a day - morning meal and evening meal - simply to find one that he will eat and then he only eats 1/2 to 2/3 of one of them for each meal, which makes for up to 9 wasted 5 oz cans a day!).  So, in the long run it's cheaper for me at least, and no headaches of trying to get him to eat something.<br /><br />I'm am extremely happy with the product and my cat is very happy with it as well.

review/text: Product Basics: My cat loves this stuff, although I only serve it once a week.  It's fairly consistent from can to can; to date, I've only opened one can that was "watery"-ish.  The texture is usually very thick and solid.<br /><br />Product Received, including Packaging & Delivery: Since a case will last several months, I was pleased to see the expiration date was well in the future.  The product arrived in a small box, packed with airbags to protect the item - not glamorous, but efficient.  The box was slightly dinged on one corner; one of the airbags had broken from the impact, but the product was protected.  No cans were damaged.  Delivery was quicker than I anticipated (took about a week).<br /><br />Amazon Experience: Amazon makes it easy to order this stuff; I've even arranged for automatic shipping (you can speed up or delay the next shipment, if you're worried about timing).  This is the best price I've found for this product.  Overall, I would buy this product from Amazon, again.

review/summary: Totally disgusting!
review/text: I went back and forth on getting my girls some of the beef flavored Newmans because 2 of the 3 can't eat chicken.  I am always looking for a good quality food to add to their rotation.  There was a pretty good sale on the beef flavored a few days ago so I bought it.  I opened a can to give them for their dinner and I absolutely could not give that to my girls!  It had an awful grey color to it and was the consistency of wall paper paste.  My cats like to chew their food not lick it up so I knew they would have an awful time with this one.  Newman's has changed.  I have tried most of the flavors over the years and I have noticed that the cans are underweight and seem to have almost as much rice as pate in them.  Will not be buying again but thank heaven for Amazon that always makes it right without any hassles.

This seasoning is usually quite expensive at the grocery store, so I was pleased to find it at Amazon for a much more reasonable price.  The box that I got had an expiration date of about 18 months out -- plenty of time to use it up before it gets stale.

review/text: Patak's Mango Relish is my favorite to add to Indian foods. Open the jar, take a whiff and I salivate. Not spicy, but chock full of flavor...intense. I like to chop up the mango into smaller pieces then mix well into whatever I am eating it with. This is hands down my favorite of Patak's relishes. Hard to find, I am going to order a six pack to have around for a while. Delicious!!!

review/summary: Good and not too spicy -- Just right if you don't like hot
review/text: Mangos -- the number one fruit in the world -- are an integral part of Indian food.  Personally, I have deeloped a tolerance for really hot foods.  On a scale from one to ten, I'd put these at about a two or three.<br /><br />This mango relish is not mango chutney (which is a totally different product).  This relish has nice chunks of mango and most people can tolerate the moderate heat.  This is the relish I serve to guests.  Like most Indian relishes, chutneys and pickles, it doesn't take too much.  One jar is probably about 30 servings so do the math: six jars is 180 servings.

review/text: I'm always working to get whole grains into the family's diet.  The kids are sensitive to grainy textures and heavy flavors, and often they push back on whole wheat breads and pastas.  This pancake mix occupies a sweet spot of healthy and delicious - wholesome, earthy taste but not overpowering.  The kids like it!  I use the substitution recommended on the box to use applesauce (unsweetened of course) in place of most of the milk, and it makes a plump, moist pancake that is delicious for days.  Like another reviewer I keep a batch around for healthy breakfasts or snacks over a few days.<br /><br />Here in GA they stock this mix at some local grocers.  My wife just came home with a box though and we found that it's quite a bit cheaper on Amazon!  I just signed up for Amazon Prime so I am in pancake heaven!

I also add about a half-cup (or to taste) of frozen wild blueberries, defrosted. Trader Joe's maple syrup is the perfect final complement. My husband raves about these pancakes! Give them a shot...

review/summary: The Best Cat Food!
review/text: I have an older cat (5yrs old now) who was constantly getting crystals and urinary blockage. Expensive trips to the vet it was. 3 years ago I adopted 2 kittens. The vet said the kittens had to eat something other than what my older cat was (she was on prescription science diet-like that's not expensive). As all cat owners know, it's nearly impossible to separate them and eat their "own food". I did lots of reasearch and found Orijen. All three cats have been eating this food for 3 years. Guess what? No medical issues...At All! I've been so pleased with this food and how healthy and happy my cats are. I will never purchase anything else for my cats. You might think it may be a little expensive, but not having to take my cats to the vet is worth every penny saved.

review/summary: Best cat food I have found!
review/text: The biggest impediments to me buying this product for the first time were the price and whether my cat would actually eat it.  I have a 3 year old Siamese cat who has been eating Orijen (15.4 lbs @ $[...]) for over a year now, previously she had been on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008DFU8">Pro Plan Indoor Care Turkey and Rice Formula Dry Cat Food</a> (7 lbs @ $23.59) which I always considered to be a "premium" cat food until I began doing some research.  As you can see, Orijen ($3.44/lb) is slightly more expensive than Purina Pro Plan ($3.37/lb).  The big difference in price, however, comes from the ingredients.  Orijen is lower in carbohydrates and higher in protein which has resulted in my cat eating approximately 1/3 less food than she had been before.  I love that her new diet is better for her health, but also easier on my pocket.<br /><br />My concerns about whether she would like the new "health food" were completely unfounded.  Of course, when I first began mixing Orijen with her old food she would eat around the new food and save it for last, but that stopped after about the fourth bowl.  She has always been picky about the treats she will eat, but recently I've been experimenting with grain-free treats and she has been taking to them without hesitation.<br /><br />I encourage anyone who is shopping for foods to compare the ingredient labels.  I was shocked to find that Purina's Pro Plan looks more like something that would be concocted by a chemistry lab than a food producer.  For example, Purina Pro Plan contains ONLY Vitamin E, A, B-12, and D-3 supplements instead of the actual sweet potatoes, kelp, pumpkin, carrots, spinach, turnip greens, apples, and cranberries found along with the supplements in Orijen.<br /><br />Finally, the last big difference that I have noticed in my cat is the number of hairballs.  When she was on Purina's Pro Plan Indoor Care, my cat would spit up at least once a month if not every couple of weeks.  Now she spits up approximately 3 or 4 times a year and only when I leave for a decent length of time, such as during the holidays or a vacation.<br /><br />Overall, I couldn't be any happier with this cat food and I can't recommend it highly enough.

review/summary: Tried them all - this is the best!
review/text: Over the course of 6 to 12 months my five year old cat had developed  loose stools and vomiting.  He got to the point that he was throwing up every day and he went from nearly 14 pounds to a low of 10.  The vet found nothing wrong with him so I started looking into his diet.  I had always fed "premium" foods like Nutro and Iams so I thought I was doing the right things.  But after researching online, I learned how misled we all are into thinking that these foods filled with corn, meat by-products and chemicals are actually good for our pets!  So I then tried lots of brands of natural food but I wasn't solving his problems until I landed on the first grain-free, high-protein food.  There was a major difference immediately!  Stools firmed up, no more vomiting at all, and he's now back up to 14+ pounds.  All three of my cats LOVE the taste of this Orijen food.  It is expensive, but they do eat less of it because in has so little filler. They all three also did well on Wellness Core, but it was obvious that they didn't like the taste.  Two out of three liked Evo, but it gave my dairy-sensitive cat loose poo, I think because it contains cottage cheese.  So this food is the all-around winner for everyone.  It has made a huge difference in the health of my cats.  This is a quality product and worth every cent!

review/summary: Best Food next to raw food diet...
review/text: When my husband saved our first little kitten from being mauled by a dog we just ran to the store and grabbed some IAMS kitten.  He would gorge himself on it and then throw up. All he did was go to the bathroom....he pooed like 5 times a day. He always seemed hungry despite all the eating. By then we had bought a Maine Coon and I switched them to a raw food diet, which was great except it was to rich for our first kitty. I finally went back and forth between EVO and Orijen. Evo is great but gave my cats sticky poo. Orijen is number one in my book. My cats have been eating it since they were about 3 months old (that's over a year now). They have NEVER thrown up or had a hair ball. They hardly shed. They have glossy coats....and they are REALLY active. They don't lay around and sleep all day. They are constantly moving and playing. This food is amazing. And they only eat 1/3c. twice a day and it's more than enough. Sometimes there is food left in the bowl. They absolutely love the taste of it. It's more expensive but a big bag lasts my two cats<br />7-8 weeks. That's about 20-25 dollars a month on cat food. Not bad considering you will save on vet bills.

review/summary: Best Dry Food Ever (IMHO)
review/text: I have two cats and a puppy and after seeing how well my new puppy was doing on Orijen, I decided to switch my cats off of Iams and onto the good stuff. One of my cats has a big weight problem, has hot spots all down her back, sheds constantly and was overall a very unhealthy cat. Two weeks after switching them to Orijen my unhealthy cat's hot spots COMPLETELY disapeared, her shedding has practically vanished (she's a long haired cat), and she has MUCH more energy and I haven't even finished cycling them off of the old food (currently using half orijen and half Iams). I've noticed a big difference on the volume and firmness of their stool as well. I can't recommend this food enough. It has probably added years onto my formerly unhealthy cat's lifespan.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about this product (probably due to the price), please at least buy a small bag to try and I guarantee that you will notice a big difference in your pet's health and lifestyle, especially if they have any food related allergies.<br /><br />The grocery store brands may be cheaper, but how healthy and content would you be if you only ate grapenuts every meal for the rest of your life?

review/summary: I'll never switch back.
review/text: For the first two years of my cats lives, they were getting Purina One, or the natural/organic stuff found at Whole Foods and Trader Joes.  My two girls were fine with it, but their brother became tubby.  I wasn't sure what to do, the cats were all getting enough exercise since they roughhouse with each other.  The one day my mom's cat was diagnosed with diabetes.  In an attempt to keep her cat healthy, she switched to another brand of "Healthy" cat food (very similar to Orijen).  I took home a sample of it for my own cats and they LOVED it.  Simply out of wanting to keep my cats from ever getting diabetes (most store brand pet foods have far too many carbs than necessary), I began my own research and came across Orijen,<br /><br />This food is amazing.  Yes, it is pricey, but because the content is less filler and more substance, they eat much less than needed, so it ends up breaking fairly even.  Their coats are healthier -- one of my girls was having a dandruff problem (something I didn't think Domestic Shorthair Tabbies could get) which cleared up after switching foods.  Their stool even became more compact because of, again, less filler.  Most importantly, my male cat suddenly began shedding the pounds with no other change other than his diet!  That made me quite happy.<br /><br />Even if you don't decide to try this dry food, research.  Make sure what you're giving your cats is actually GOOD for them and not just stamped with some fancy designer label like Science Diet.  My cats being happy makes ME happy.

review/summary: Great for All Kitties!
review/text: I have three cats - an 8 year old "senior", a 5 year old, and a 4 month old kitten. My older male cat is notoriously picky about his dry food. He and my calico have been on Science Diet sensitive stomach food for three and a half years now with an unsuccessful attempt to move them over to Natural Balance. They would scoop out the Natural Balance and eventually went on a hunger strike. Needless to say I switched them back to Science Diet.<br /><br />When I got the kitten things became a bit tricky. My male cat would chow down on the kitten's dry food leaving nothing for my little one. I attempted to be more vigilant with them, but I can't monitor the food 24/7 so when I noticed my kitten chowing down on my dog's food (Orijen 6 fish because the poor thing has allergies and can't have grains) I thought...hmm, maybe I'll try Orijen for the cats. Luckily with the cat and kitten food in one bag I didn't need to buy two different kinds and I could feed them all in one place. Switching them over to Orijen was the best decision I've made for them in a long time. I switched them over pretty much cold turkey (bad, I know), but I haven't had any problems and they ate around whatever was left of the Science Diet. They ALL like it, even my picky eater. On top of all of this, their coats are AMAZING. My big male cat had problems bathing himself and would get dreads towards his tush and now his hair is silky smooth all around. The kitten and my calico also have gorgeous, soft coats as well.<br /><br />My cats are happy and thus, I'm happy!

review/summary: possibly the best dry cat food available
review/text: If you read all the reviews, you can tell the common theme is that people who like this food are all research nuts.  I spent hours and hours online educating my self on cat food after my cat got sick.  All these years, I've been feeding them Science Diet because "the vets recommends it".  But after doing my own research, I realized much like any industry, the vets are not immune to financial "encouragement" when recommending food and that Science Diet is just junk.  As it turned out, my cat actually had a rare form of cancer, although I can't be sure whether feeding her better food from the beginning would have prevented it.  She didn't survive the cancer.  But I can still give my other cats a better diet now that I'm more educated on cat food.  After exhaustive research, and of course taste tests by my cats, we've settled on the Orijen brand.  It just makes me feel better that I'm giving them the best food there is out there, or at least that I know of.  It is very expensive, and not a lot of stores carry it.  Wag.com actually has it for a decent price.<br />I give my cats Orijen on top of the wet food they get twice daily.  It seems to work well.  My senior cat has more energy and can now keep up with his younger playmates, and my outside cats gained some lean muscle and overall look healthier.  I just wish I had known about Orijen years ago.

review/summary: A winner!
review/text: I wanted to try something new for my two 7 y.o. cats and based on the positive reviews I decided to try this brand. When I put some of this food next to the bowl containing Organix, one of my cats was eating this so fast he actually started choking-this has NEVER happened w/ any other dry food I've given him except for Greenies' treats. Granted it's expensive but so are the other brands I buy and I happened to get this when Pet Food Direct had free shipping. Since I bought the large bag I'm eager to see if I notice any health benefits,(granted my cats are healthy prior to eating this food), particularly the dental ones mentioned by other reviewers. The back of the bag contains a very detailed ingredient list. I'm not sure that cats need all the ingredients listed, but it is impressive.

review/summary: Switched from Science Diet and WOW!
review/text: After a lot of research, not just into types of dry cat food but what was readily available in a variety of local shops (since I had no intention of being dependent on having food shipped in specially) I decided on Science Diet Kitten for my cat, then a kitten, Whisper. She loved the small shape of the food and immediately took to it, though she put on just a tad more weight than was needed.<br /><br />The space of a year later and I've moved to a far more rural area where even a handy selection of Science Diet wasn't available! I'd picked the stuff mainly for it's availability and never been truly satisfied with the amount of protein it offered. Now Whisper is full grown, just this side of being obese and also suffering relatively constant stomach upset.<br /><br />Since availability was no longer the issue I went looking for a food in comparable price range, size of kibble, with a higher protein content and found Orijen. Whisper took to it immediately. Stopped having stomach problems. Her coat improved (she used to shed constantly even when using the furminator on her daily, now hardly at all) and most surprisingly - has lost several pounds on the exact same portion size! Whisper enjoys the small easy to crunch kibbles, is thrilled with her new food and I'm thrilled that she seems to be a healthier, happier cat without expensive vet bills or a steep spike in expenses!<br /><br />Got a new kitten recently and started her right out with Origen. I can't imagine ever going back to something like Science Diet which even my vet says is like McDonald's for animals.

review/text: My siberian loves this food. I tried the 6 Fish kind as well from Orijen and although my cat loved the taste, the smell was enough to keep me away. I will continue to buy this food for my kitty. His coat is gorgeous, no hairballs, compact stools, and the convinience of a kibble food (raw diet was too much work with my two jobs). Love ORIJEN!

review/summary: Great, but wish it didn't have peas!
review/text: I've been feeding my cat Wellness Core for 3 years but since they recently changed their formula, I decided to research for another grain free cat food brand.  After reading good reviews on Orijen, I decided on a little bag to see if my cats would like it.<br /><br />Cats didn't seem to have a problem with it and I liked that it's 80% protein so I'm sticking with it for now. I would give this 5 stars if it didn't have peas.  Peas in their food make my cats' poop very smelly.

review/summary: The ingredients speak for themselves!
review/text: I have done a ton of reading & research on ALL the dry kibble brands that are in the North American market. Without a doubt Orijen is the best brand available. The ingredients do make a huge difference. I have noticed my persian cats loving every bite, but will not over eat. They get filled a lot faster because of the high quality protein. Thus producing smaller and less stool. That means less kitty litter wasted. So as price is concerned, it does even out at the end. Prior to Orijen I used Purina One. They loved it, but ate much more and were always extremely thirsty. The stool was huge!--no thanks to corn and other cheap grain fillers. With dry kibble, dogs and cats do drink more water as compared to eating canned or raw. But FRESH water is always there. I do include a few medallions of Natures Variety Raw every other day. I have seen improvement in coat, reduction in eye gunk and more energy. My cats have also shown no signs of hairballs. This company is no gimmick. Petfood companies use many ways to get you to buy their food. But just do a little research by looking at the ingredients. Nobody beats Orijen. I am very picky, and am proud to promote this product as A+

review/summary: You can tell the difference.
review/text: Being a person who loves animals, I highly recommend this food. Never has my cat's coat been SOO soft and shiny. She is the healthiest she has ever been. When she uses the litter box, I NEVER smell it. I also never feed her any canned cat food unless it is all natural and good enough for me to eat if I wanted. She is 6 years old and I got her when she was about 1 year and believe me, I have experienced the difference between her life eating cheap cat food and her life while eating Orijen and there is a major difference. I value REAL, HONEST stuff and this brand is my favorite. Keep it real Orijen!!!

review/text: My vet was shocked by how improved both my male cats were doing since I switched to this formula..not only could I cut their portions so they would trim up but they were noticeably healthier and though they are close to 8yo, they started having energy like they were half that age. You will not regret spending alittle more for this high quality food and your cats will thrive on it.

review/summary: Great food!!
review/text: I am on my 3rd bag of Orijen, and I am really starting to notice the difference it is making. I have two older kitties (they are 20 yr old brothers) a 7yr old and a 5yr old. The two younger kitties coats are getting ever softer. They have always been pretty playful--but the two of them are getting outright hyper lately. And one of my older guys is suddenly starting to play again, too! I can't tell you how funny/sweet it is to see a 20 yr old cat playing like he's 15 years younger! I have also noticed a HUGE difference in how much they are eating. They are satisfied on much less food than before. My 15 lb bag is lasting much longer than with my old brand. (And my old brand was a very good quality food--just not apparently as good as Orijen!) I am very happy with Orijen. I'd give it 5 stars if they would leave out the potatoes and other starchy veggies. This is still a very low carb food, tho. For sure recommend!

review/summary: Great Kibble
review/text: Orijen is an excellent quality kibble. The weightiness is substantial and the colour is rich and dark. This product is made at Canada's Champion Foods facility where another favorite kibble, Acana, is produced. The ingredients are impressive and the company appears to be in tune with using regional farmers and fisheries.<br /><br />We have two young cats and have been using a 50/50 mix of Orijen (or other grain free) and Acana Grassland with no complaints. Fur is soft, eyes are clear, litterbox isn't smelly and all seems well. The shape of this kibble is odd, it's not a flat disk nor is it a nugget.<br /><br />At first both my cats weren't interested in this stuff. One even tossed it out of the bowl, prefering only to eat Acana. Altering the mixture percentages over two days, I was able to get both cats to accept the Orijen without problem. Other than an expensive price tag, I can find nothing wrong with Orijen.

review/summary: Excellent food and supplier
review/text: The food's quality is evident from the ingredients list, as well as the fact that everyone who comes over comments on how soft and shiny our cats' coats are--even if they've already made that comment in the past!  The cats love it, and there have been no tummy-upset side effects since feeding them this (for the past year) or any other negatives.<br /><br />I also wanted to note that this 5-star review applies to this supplier, as well (who isn't Orijen direct).  They ship almost immediately every time I buy, and I usually receive my food within 2-3 days tops.  And this time, when they were unfortunately out of stock of the 15lb bag, they called me the day after I placed my order and informed me it would be running late, but would be shipped by this week--which, lo and behold, it was indeed.  They're fast, efficient, courteous, and the food always arrives safe and packaged well.  Thank you for providing an excellent cat food with excellent service!

I was skeptical to try other flavors as he loved the paw lickin chicken - but he loves the other ones as well - now mealtime is fun. THank you weruva and amazon for offering.

review/text: Weruva appears to be a high-quality, human grade food.  My cats just love it!  My only gripe is when Amazon does not specifiy if it is cat food or dog food.  When they don't, it usually means its dog food, even when I do a specific search for "Weruva canned cat food".  And then the Amazon representative tries to tell my the cat and dog food is the same!  NOT!

review/summary: My dog loves it!
review/text: We just recently added a corgi to our family, and I started researching different types of wet and dry foods for our pup. After trying different raw diets, we eventually settled on the Weruva brand of dog food. Our local pet store recommended it to us, and the girl working actually opened up a can and started eating it! It's processed in Thailand, and before that scares anybody, you have to realize that the food processing laws in Thailand are MUCH more strict than in America (read it up online!). They are not allowed to process by-product in their pet food, or use filler product. Weruva definitely does not have any of that--you can actually eat the dog food and it'll taste just like dinner.<br /><br />Our boy has a sensitive stomach and he's a very picky eater. The first night we got him the regular Chicken with Gravy he ate that whole can up. He loved it, and when we tried feeding him anything different he refused. Then we ordered him the Kobe Master flavor and it quickly became one of his favorites. I'd definitely recommend this brand, especially coming from a very concerned dog owner. I won't feed my dog anything else.

review/text: My dog is picky with food, I mean PICKY!!!  She is not big on eating.  No biscuit type treat has worked on her.  She even refused a stranger trying to feed her real meat!(She doesn't trust strangers I guess...)  After months of trying every type in the market.  I'm saying all of this to say that she is super pickyk.  She'll only eat real chicken breast jerky, dingo brand bone with chicken in the middle, and the weruva brand wet food.  (And fresh vegies and fruit... mystery)  Anyhoo, of all the dog food/treat in the market, she LOVES this one the best.  That says a lot.

review/text: Please ignore the 1 star review.  That's an Amazon mistake and this terrific dog food doesn't deserve a one star because of an Amazon tagging error.  Weruva is one of the only genuinely human grade dog food products available.  My three pugs had totally gone off their food for days until I tried this brand .... I was going to buy Merrick (which they don't like very much) and found this instead.  It is spectacular.  Doesn't even smell like dogfood.  And, Amazon's price is very reasonable compared to my local retailer.  THIS IS A GREAT DOGFOOD PRODUCT and really worth trying out if you are an animal lover.  BTW - I now give it to my cats too and they are the fussiest eaters in the world -- they love it too.
