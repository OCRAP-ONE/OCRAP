review/summary: Emeril's K-cups
review/text: Great coffee! It is bold! What Emeril says on the box about being a chef and having to get up extra early in the morning and needing an eye opener is true for me. I get up at 5am and need something bold and strong to lift my eyelids-this does the trick! Sometimes I need a pick me up after work to get a 'second wind', Big Easy Bold from Emeril does it again. You must like dark and bold-it's not for the faint of heart.

review/summary: Made For A King
review/text: in my opinion,this is  the best,richest tasting, full bodied coffee I have ever  tasted so far, in the last 55 years of my life. Full bodied, with just the right amount of sweetness  and an indescribable  rich  aftertaste, I have not experienced ever before.  This replaces my previous favorite Green Mountain Dark Magic. The surprise with Emeril's coffee is, it is always the same consistency with every cup. In my opinion,this is the best coffee you can purchase for the Keurig.In my opinion, this coffee is so perfect it deserves to be called,The "KING OF COFFEE until something better comes along.That may be impossible.

review/summary: A real coffee drinker's coffee
review/text: I consider this the best k-cup coffee out there for real coffee drinkers.  At least for those who want a nice bold cup of coffee like Starbucks used to have before they went to the all McDonald's like "Pike's Place Roast" all day policy. The boldest and most flavorful of all K-cups. This is great coffee. I brew two K-cups to fill up my cup first at the smallest cup and the second at the middle cup and it is still nice and bold, tastes great. In the afternoon I brew two at the smallest cup size.

review/summary: How Could You Be So Bold
review/text: After FINALLY purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">the best coffee maker</a> I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a "to each his or her own" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the "Midnight Magic" brand; I've tried the "Jet Fuel" brand; I've tried the "Donut Shop" brand; I've tried all of the "Extra Bolds"; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!

review/summary: Differentiate Between Bold and Bitter
review/text: Some reviews here call this coffee "Bitter" - well all I have to say to them is: "Clean your pot" - if you can't handle a strong cup of coffee, go buy a latte and let people who like REAL coffee define - coffee - not a non-carbonated soft drink that you want so badly.<br /><br />Of all the K-Cups, this is by far the best coffee around. It is bold, strong, and keeps you wanting more. This is why its the best selling K-Cup around. I suggest that you shop wisely online for these, and buy in quantity, this is what I do - I get usually 12 24-Pack boxes. Me and my wife drink this daily - it truly is a great tasting coffee - without any of that ridiculous flavoring that some on here want - if you drink this you better wear pants - otherwise stay in your skirt and drink some Sanka!

review/summary: the real bold coffee
review/text: I've chosen many bolds from the Amazon offers here as well as other on line shops. I always felt there left something more to be desired in each one I tried. This is the problem with the K-cup b/c the amount of coffee is limited, and when I am feeling like I want something stronger, which is often, I can't just put more in the hopper like I used to with the old machine. I often add another K cup after the first into teh same big cup. Also, often when I'd get to work I'd make another.<br /><br />I've had Emeril's Big Easy for a month now, and rarely have I felt like I needed to double the cups, or needed more when I get to work.<br /><br />I think that says it all.

review/summary: Strong and Smooth, Top-notch Flavor
review/text: I like strong coffee. If you can see light through the coffee, it's too weak for me. After trying a couple dozen various K-cups from other suppliers, Emeril's Big Bold Easy stands out from the crowd. It is everything advertised: Big (strong), Bold (great flavor), and Easy (not bitter at all). Another reviewer mentioned Newman's Own Extra Bold, which is also good, but for me, Emeril's wins without contest.

review/text: I'm not a fancy person, but getting out the little glass teapot and having tea with my daughter or friends is fun. Watching the pretty flower bloom inside the pot makes it more so, especially when your guest hasn't seen it before. The flowers are very nice and the tea is delicious. The jasmine flavor is strong but not too strong.

review/summary: A guilty pleasure
review/text: If you are used to stronger brews of conventional teas, you may not initially like or appreciate a flowering tea. However, for drinkers who have a sensitive and refined palate, this tea imparts subtle nuances once you grow accustomed to its milder taste and aroma.<br /><br />I prefer the jasmine flavor among the many varieties of this type of tea, and usually enjoy mine with a slight touch of honey. I also like it slightly sweetened with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F5K5N2">Goya Panela Brown Sugar Cane 1 Lb - Redonda</a> on occasion. Your taste may vary.<br /><br />When I first started drinking this tea I would brew it in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ADS5TU">Bodum Chambord 8 cup French Press Coffee Maker, 34 oz., Chrome</a>, but finally purchased a proper pot that still allows me to enjoy not only the flavor, but the visual beauty of the flowing pod, this satisfying two senses: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DI9NSA">40-oz. Capacity Heatproof Glass Teapot and Tea Flowers</a>.<br /><br />For devoted tea drinkers used to stronger brews this type will take some getting used to, but once you become accustomed to the milder brew of a flowering tea you will taste subtle flavors that make it all worthwhile. It is my guilty pleasure. One final note, purchasing this in a three-box set is vastly more economical than purchasing individual boxes such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K78C1M">Jasmine Lovers White Flowering Tea 6 blossoms 6 Blossoms</a>.  Enjoy.

review/summary: Flavor is way too MILD!!
review/text: I love jasmine green tea, so thought this jasmine flavored white tea would do the trick and fulfill my need/desire for jasmine flavored tea. Boy, was I wrong!! This tea doesn't taste like jasmine to me at all and the flavor it does have is really, really mild. Too mild for me. I don't like my tea to be overpowering to my palate, but I don't want it to taste too weak either... And yes, before you ask, I did brew this tea as directed per the instructions on the package. The second time I tried making this tea, I did brew it longer than directed to see if I could drum up a stronger taste/flavor.... Bad move, brewing this tea longer than directed only makes it taste bitter. So, I've continued brewing this tea as directed... I still have two unopened boxes of this tea and one ball of tea still left in the 1st box I opened. I usually drink up tea swiftly as I love great tasting tea. This one missed the mark. I won't be buying it again.

review/summary: This Is Okay
review/text: I love lavender Earl Grey so I wanted to give this a try.  It is okay.  I still prefer Evolution's Lavender Earl Grey in the infuser bags.  One reason I am disappointed with this is the packaging, which is a jaw-dropping excess of material whether it is recyclable/compostable or not.  When I buy organic I am thinking sustainable and that includes the packaging.  This is in a box, which then has individual matchstick like "boxes" that drape over the cup.  It is innovative but to me a great excess.  Beyond that the flavor is nice but nothing to swoon over for a true tea connoisseur. When you open the box the freshness and fragrance of the tea in the bag is not as pronounced as I am accustomed to with very high quality 100% natural teas.

review/summary: Memories
review/text: I bought this item and had it shipped to my sister in Alberta, Canada  I live in Ontario)for her birthday. We were exchanging emails about memories of when we children and she mentioned the Loganberry Concentrate our Father got us all the time from Cyrstal Beach. She said she really had a craving for it. Well, I knew what I had to do. I tried to find it in Crystal Beach but the manufacturer had closed down so I looked it up on the internet and that led me to Amazon. Amazon came through and I purchased it for my sister. The Loganberry Concentrate got to my sister well ahead of her Birthday. She said that it tasted just like when we were children and the gallon I sent her would last a long time because she lives alone. The packaging was well done to protect the cargo and the people who delivered it left it with her neighbour as she instructed in a note on her door, while she was at work. So the I'd say the Loganberry Concentrate was a sweet success.

review/summary: I Love This Chocolate!
review/text: This is my new favorite chocolate.  It has a very smooth mouth feel.  It is nice & sweet.  The ingredients are 100% organic:  Organic Milk Chocolate (Organic evaporated cane juice, organic cocoa butter*, organic whole milk powder, organic chocolate liquor*, organic soy lecithin [an emulsifier], organic vanilla.  *Rainforest Alliance Certified cocoa.<br /><br />Personally I find most other chocolates create a dry feeling in my mouth.  I don't know how else to describe it.  They don't taste, feel or look as smooth.  Also they don't taste as sweet.  This chocolate tastes & smells wonderful.  I think the addition of vanilla might be what gives it that perfect touch.  I eat too much of it & order it by the case on Amazon as I have found that Amazon has the best price vs the few stores in my area that carry organic chocolate.<br /><br />If you like your chocolate sweet, creamy & organic then Newman's Milk Chocolate is for you!  Yum!

review/text: This is my favorite milk chocolate. It has the best ingredients, many of which are organic. It is made with true, organic vanilla. Most bars, even high priced, are made with "Real Vanilla Flavor" or "Vanillin" (both trick ways to label fake vanilla ingredients). Newman's Own milk chocolate tastes like the chocolate Easter Bunnies that were in baskets, long ago (best I've had in many years). Newman's Own makes fabulous products. This milk chocolate is so good. It is creamy and melts in the mouth. If you want an occasional chocolate treat, why not go for the best!

review/text: I bought this chocolate from Whole foods because it was discounted and I paid a little under $2.00. Yes, this chocolate is sweet but I would imagine that is the reason most of us enjoy this treat! It has a smooth richness of cocoa and just the right amount of milk. I have been eating mostly dark chocolate for years and I was in the mood for something different. I would definitely recommend a chance to taste this treat. Plus its organic and you feel you are putting forth your money for a worthwhile cause.

review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Everyday Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

I thought this would be something to compliment the excellent tasting hot mustard packets by Lady brand but this duck sauce is just liquid goo/cornstarch with no flavor.  2 thumbs down as I think I can find another brand somewhere.

review/summary: Herdez salsa helps me survive the Midwest
review/text: Herdez salsas have been a favorite of mine since I was introduced to their products by friends living in Mexico. Since moving to the Midwest, I have been able to reliably find the Salsa Casera at local grocers until our recent move. Being something of a salsa snob, I headed to the internet to see if there was another way for me to purchase it. Amazon to the rescue, of course.<br /><br />The cans are a perfect serving size for a nice snack of chips and salsa. The flavor is a little bit spicy, but still flavorful and balanced enough for my Midwestern husband (whose favorite spices are ketchup and salt).

review/summary: Hot, tangy, and yummy!
review/text: The Hardez Salsa Casera is tasty and quite yummy! The vegtables are not stringy and the sauce is not too acidic like other canned brands. The Hardez Salsa Casera is hot, but not too hot, especially in comparison to many authentic resturants. I perfer and usually buy authentic, fresh salsa. However, these cans and snack-size bags (e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V8WNIK">Medora Snacks Popcorners Popped Corn Chips with Sea Salt, 5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>) have shelf-life for storage in the car or office. Therefore, they make a great afternoon snack while on a road trip or sitting at your desk.

review/text: Since I first tried Fever Tree Ginger Ale a few months back, I have tried to find another "premium" ginger ale that comes anywhere close to it in taste or mouthfeel.  No dice.

review/summary: It isn't Stewart's Ginger Beer, but .....
review/text: Stewart's had abandoed us by no longer making the best of ginger beers.  Fever-Tree is a bit milder than Stewarts though not as sweet but unlike Goya which I tried to live with, it does not inflame your intestines on the way down!  It is obviously expensive and the bottles are tiny so I have two suggestions:  The first is that Fever-Tree consider selling the public the concentrate and let us mix our own.  The product I believe is made in the UK and shipped to California most likely in that concentrated form anyway.  By going that route or adding it to their product line, we would not have to pay for heavy glass bottles of fizzy water.<br /><br />My other suggestion is to mix a couple of inches from the Fever-Tree bottle with something like Arizona's very bland Diet Iced Tea.  It punches up the tea and certainly stretches the number of glasses of the ginger beer we can taste.  No one can afford these days to drink Fever-Tree straight on a daily basis.  But it is a worthwhile contender to the void Stewart's has created and I for one will never understand.

review/summary: Simply the BEST Ginger Beer in the World!!
review/text: Before I tried Fever Tree Ginger Beer, I thought Bundaberg Ginger Beer was the best tasting, full bodied drink availble - and it is pretty darn good. But nothing can compare to Fever Tree for taste, quality, bite and flavor. It is unadulterated, meaning it is not laced with too much sugar, citric acid, lemon juice, spices etc that other brands add.<br />The only downer is that it is very expensive and hard to find in shops - so thank goodness for Amazon!

Make your own gelatin using hot water and fruit juice, no sugar, nothing artificial, tastes great and it's good for you.  Dissolve three tablespoons of gelatin powder in two cups of fruit juice, stir and let sit for a minute or two, add one cup of hot water, and put in a pan to cool for a few hours.  You can add some fresh fruit, walnuts, anything you like.  Yummy, especially with creme fraiche on top.

review/summary: A good price for a large amount of gelatin
review/text: The local grocery store sells gelatin for an insane price that made me shy away from any recipes that called for gelatin. However, this product was offered at a really good price! It was a lot of gelatin, so i would suggest splitting the purchase with another person (or even three more people, it's a lot!). I probably wont need to buy any gelatin for another 20 years! The gelatin immediately bloomed after i added water into it and dissolved very quickly. The only problem that I had with this product was that it had a strange odor that was kind of unpleasant and strong. However, when you add it into other products, you couldn't smell or taste it. I did get some what confused on the product as well.... as i notice after the purchase. Can a product made from pork be called kosher? I thought you could not..... So buyers be aware!

review/summary: Great product at an excellent price
review/text: This is SO MUCH cheaper than any other gelatin I have ever seen (especially grocery store gelatin which is just ridiculous). I use it to make fondant (dough like cake icing) and it works just as great as the name brand. The only thing I don't like about it is that it smells considerably worse than the Knox I used previously. I don't notice any difference in the final product (although fondant only calls for about a tablespoon of gelatin to a pound of powdered sugar, so maybe the excessive sugar just masks the smell and taste). I can't imagine it makes a huge difference in the final product unless you're mixing the gelatin in water and drinking it plain (it sounds horrifying, but they actually give instructions for that on the box). So I definitely say to give it a try! If the slightly off taste/smell isn't a big deal this product is certainly a better deal than other gelatins.
