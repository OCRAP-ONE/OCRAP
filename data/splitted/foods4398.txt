review/summary: Another Great Product from Clif
review/text: I prefer these over comparable granola bars in both taste and texture, and the fact that Clif uses 'Organic' ingredients is an added bonus.  I am an avid hiker, and these have held up better than other brands on my hikes.

review/summary: Yummy bars!
review/text: My daughter loves these bars.  The order came quickly.  No complaints whatsoever.  The only thing I would mention is that these bars are crumbly and do not "travel well" compared to the softer bars out there.  So I think we will have some softer bars for travel and these bars when travel is not an issue.  Hope that makes sense!

review/summary: Filling and taste great too!
review/text: I like Clif bars because they taste good but not great enough that you want to eat a whole lot of them. These crunch bars are no exception. I usually have clif bars in my school bag to stave off hunger during classes before succumbing to the call of a vending machine.<br /><br />The Chocolate Macadamia Nut flavor is a bit too sweet for my tastes which was a little surprising for a Clif bar (but it is chocolate). I like that each packet comes with two thin bars rather than one big granola bar - great for sharing or portioning.

review/summary: Delicious!  But Too Crumbly!
review/text: I like Clif products in general and this one is also pretty good.  It tastes good and it has better list of ingredients than the more processed ones from Nature's Valley, etc.  But the thing crumbles too much.  It doesn't hold together very well and from the moment you open the package, there's crumbs all over you.  Just be aware of it.  It's tasty and crunchy as they say on the package.

review/summary: Clif Crunch Bar
review/text: I love these things! Usually they go on sale on Amazon and I only buy them when they are about $6 - 7 for the pack of two. My favorite kind is the white chocolate macadamia nut. However, when I bought them I wasn't expecting them to be quite so messy. They are definitely crunchy, and you will get crumbs everywhere - so keep that in mind. Otherwise I love the things! I'm a college student so this is a good breakfast or snack on my walk to class.

review/summary: Decent granola bar, but the packaging is a bit misleading
review/text: When I first opened the box I was surprised to find 5 packages of granola bars, each with 2 bars each, so a "10-pack" has 5 packages with 2 granola bars in each package (I never noticed it was normal to do that with granola bars), hence the serving size is 2 bars. The price for each packet is about the same as that of a normal clif bar, so I don't know if it's really worth it to me. You get about 60% more mass with a clif bar than with this for the same price.<br /><br />That being said, they taste decent and taste good broken into pieces with peanut butter and nutella.

No high fructose corn syrup, a big plus.  They do have "evaporated cane juice" as the sweetener.  I'm not familiar with it, but a quick google search shows it to be a healthier and better alternative to regular cane sugar.<br /><br />Great texture and crunch, and great flavor.  A perfect snack that is much much healthier than a lot of alternatives.<br /><br />I could not imagine a better granola bar.  Try these, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Crunched Crunch
review/text: Got these with a one-day shipping delay, but still very quickly with Amazon Prime.  The taste is quite good, perhaps a little on the sweet side - especially when you hit a pocket of white chocolate.  The big problem is the condition of the product when it arrives.  I opened my first 2-pack and the granola bars were crushed into nuggets and powder.  Strangely, the box wasn't in bad shape, just the bars.  A few days later, I opened the other box of granola bars, which was in better shape than the first one, and the first pack I tried again contained smashed fragments of granola bars.  These are no fun to eat, as you can't really open the pack and pour it into your mouth (I tried), and if you pick out the big chunks you get fragments and powder sticking to your fingers, and on your clothes (and in your beard).  I'll eat the rest, maybe out of a bowl with a spoon or something (with some fava beans and a nice chianti...), but I won't be ordering any more crunched Clif Crunch bars.

review/summary: Another natural berry product
review/text: Unsweetened gooseberries have a slightly sour flavor, although they can be eaten unsweetened.  Sugar is usually added if they are made into pies, cobbler, or jam.  We had our own gooseberry bush when I was a child, and I do remember eating the berries right off the bush.  Like other berry products, they are high in anti-oxidents.  There are various nutritional claims, still to be verified, including a claim that they will help burn off belly fat (a problem some of us have).  So, we shall see.  I have just started trying these.<br /><br />To obtain a sweeter flavor, the dried berries can be dipped in honey or sugar syrup.

review/summary: Very tasty, but heavy on the cloves
review/text: I am a huge fan of rooibos tea, and I drink at least three cups a day. I was really looking forward to trying this rooibos blend with fruit and spices. The first cup I tried was completely overwhelmed by the flavor of cloves. I like cloves, but not to the exclusion of everything else. After the first cup, I examined the remaining sachets. Each one had at least one whole clove, and some had as many as five cloves, which is cloverkill for one cup of tea!<br /><br />Not wanting to toss the remaining teabags, I ended up opening the fabric sachets and removing the offending cloves, and using the tea loose. For me, that wasn't a problem, but if you don't have the gear for dealing with loose tea (a strainer or a tea ball), it might be a deal breaker.<br /><br />With the cloves removed, the tea was delightful. The flavor of the rooibos was accented by a bit of apple and spice flavor that enhanced but did not overwhelm the flavor of the tea.

review/summary: This is delicious crab meat!
review/text: I like to be able to just open a can to instantly make a crab meat salad.  Add mayo, lettuce, celery, and onions and this variety is delicious.  The flavor comes through scrumptiously.  I'm sure fresh caught crabs would be the best but I think removing the meat is very time consuming, messy, and tedious.  The cans do have the occasional little bits of shell but not as many as some of the other brands of crab meat I've tried.....and I've tried many varieties.  It is a bit expensive but I think of it as a treat to myself that I have every once in a while...especially in the summer.  If you like crab meat....you'll like this brand but I'd suggest buying one can locally before buying a whole case from Amazon!  Enjoy!

review/summary: Not that good
review/text: The 15% leg meat raised this from a 1 to a 2 but overall this product isn't very good.  It has a vague crab like flavor but the texture is not anything like fresh crab.  I can buy decent fresh crab meet at BJs for $13 for 16 oz of crab meat (Sam's has the same for $16) There is 4.25 oz of crab in the 6 oz can so this is cheaper (~$9/lb) but I don't enjoy eating it.

review/text: Use to buy these at a store around the corner from a movie theater, but that was back in 2008. I have looked in several groceries and chain retailers but can only find the original gummiburst, not the sour one. Item arrived quick and packaged nicely, but the Texas heat melted most of the gummibursts. I opened the first bag and they were all squished and stuck together. I will try putting a bag in the freezer and see if that helps separate them. I would advise purchasing this when the weather cools down a bit

This products works out to be a perfect high quality sort of generic soy sauce flavoring that meets my general needs.<br /><br />However, I wish it had an organic with sea salt version (low salt) like some of the higher priced but more boutique like Kikkoman competitors, which I have only found in relatively small bottles.<br /><br />Actually, this is "Way" too much for a single individual; 4 gallons. I think there might be a very good market for 64 ounce or half gallon size, low salt, sea salt organic bean soy sauce products.

review/text: I discovered Vruit a long time ago, and have been giving it to my kids ever since!  It is a little harder for me to get the product now, I can not find it in stores in my area anymore.  I have been ordering from Amazon, but I am starting to fear that this company, "American Soy" is phasing out Vruit and that I may not be able to get it after a certain point.  I like the Orange veggie flavor, because not only does it have orange and red veggies in it, it also has green veggies (celery and spinach).  My children love the flavor, they only taste the fruit juice.  I do have veggie eaters, but only certain types of veggies, and Vruit gives them that extra boost of vegetables.  I hope that this product stays around for a long time, it is much better than the V8 Fruision drinks!

review/text: *****<br />Zhena's Gyspy Love Black Tea is a lovely black tea, with slight overtones of rose petals...subtle and endearing. I brew it strong and it is not bitter. I totally enjoy Zhena's Love Tea. If you are a tea drinker, this is one tea that would have universal appeal and that you could buy a large tin of and not go wrong. The rose petals are barely discernable and just enough to make the tea interesting.<br /><br />Zhena's Gyspy Love Tea contains: organic Indian and Sri Lankan black tea, red & pink rose petals and all natural flavor. One cup contains about 1/2 of the caffeine of a cup of coffee.<br /><br />Zhena's Gypsy Tea is a wonderful company that makes teas that are organic, fair trade, and processes tea using green practices. They have high standards and make quality teas. [...]. They all come in eco-conscious tins. Because of the high quality of the teas, they do tend to be a bit more expensive, but worth it if you believe in supporting the environment and in fair trade.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Delicious chocolate coating
review/text: I'm a chocolate junkie, always searching for the a satisfying middle to high end quality chocolate and willing to experiment when I read other favorable reviews.  I saw multiple favorable comments about Bissinger's maltballs and some that were neutral to negative.  This intrigued and puzzle me, so I decided to give them a try. From my taste test of four brands, including Bissinger's, I found Bissinger's offers a perfect blend between the chocolate coating and the malted interior.  It is difficult for me to rank the quality of each brand, because the chocolate coating of each is unique, and depending on your taste buds or even the time of day, you may prefer one over the other. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with Bissinger's.  That is not the case with two other maltball brands I compared this too.  Another winner in my book is Ghiradelli.  Either of these two are worth the purchase.

review/summary: Hot sauce concentrate, use at your own risk
review/text: This is like hot sauce concentrate.  You MUST dilute it to use it.  Do not try to eat this stuff straight or you will be miserable for hours, and then some.  Lets just say it burns both ways.  A teaspoon in an entire crock of chili will make the chili hot enough to be near inedible, and I like very hot and spicy foods.  Five or six drops is probably more than enough for an entire dish.  Tabasco isn't even comparable to this, because no amount of tabasco would make a dish that hot.  This is truly the hotest sauce I have ever had, I think it killed my tastebuds (slight sarcasm).<br /><br />Wash your hands thoroughly after use as there will often be residue on the lid.  If you rub your eyes they will burn for a long time, and I would suggest flushing them with water for about 10 minutes if you have the unfortunate experience.<br /><br />The first listed ingredient is habaneros.

review/text: This is a two part review.  First, for those who don't usually take in spicy foods, and then for the enthusiasts.<br /><br />Those who don't regularly consume and/or enjoy hot/spicy foods, I don't know why, except to perhaps experience anaphylactic shock, you would use this sauce.  Some may use it as a terrible prank, or for less evil-minded people, perhaps to add just a tiny drop to a huge pot of chili to spicen things up.  I would warn you to be extremely careful with this.  Nothing but holding cold milk in your mouth for several minutes will get rid of your world of pain.  You may also experience breathing difficulties, and I'm not trying to kid or scare you, just warn you of the realities.<br /><br />For those who love hot sauces, you'll note something very interesting, as you may have noticed with all the previous sauces before.  First you'll be shocked by how little of this sauce is required to produce a lot of heat.  But rather quickly, the heat will disappear, and you'll be filled with massive cravings for the endorphin rush produced by putting a lot on a little.  I swear, I'm salivating for that sauce right now as I write, and I smear this stuff on like ketchup; and those of you who experience no pain with very hot foods know exactly what I'm talking about.  A fair warning is necessary however, that this sauce, while it may produce an extremely pleasant sensation for the "connoisseur", will nevertheless peel the skin off your hard palate if you use too much, or for too long/often.<br /><br />My quest continues for a sauce that will be so painful that my nervous system will be unable to compensate for it.  Any recommendations are welcome.

review/summary: Great heat, but a distinction needs to be made...
review/text: This sauce is VERY HOT. There are typically two types of people buying hot sauce - someone looking for an alternative to tobasco or supermarket shelf hot sauce, and someone looking for a high end flavored hot sauce.<br /><br />If you are in the first category, be very careful. This is not the sauce you want to buy to try something hotter than tobasco, cholula, or other garden variety hot sauces. Dave's (and a bunch of other retailers on here) have a wide variety of hot sauces which are much hotter than tobasco, et al, but not in the same league as this. The roasted garlic or scotch bonnet from Dave's are an alternative - spicy, but not like this.<br /><br />If you are undeterred from my above comment, then here:<br />I like this sauce a lot. It is flavorful compared to other hot sauces in the same heat range (90000-250000 SU seems to be the range for this sauce). Using a cap or less in a pot of chili will make it hot enough that I'm sure the average person would have trouble handling it. You can use it a half-drop at a time as a flavor enhancer, and it will burn but still taste decent. I don't claim it tastes great, but it isn't like other super-high-end sauces. This sauce is approaching the top before you get into capsaicin extracts, though there are other, hotter products out there that are still considered sauces.<br /><br />To clarify, this has been tagged as an extract: it isn't. It contains extract, but it is a sauce, not a pepper extract.<br /><br />Good luck!

review/summary: Hot No Flavor. I Bought This and Mad Dog at the Same Time.
review/text: I Purchased this and Mad Dog 357 ghost pepper sauce <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002B9HC6I">Mad Dog 357 Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce</a> at the same time. I love hot sauce, but this had no flavor.<br />The makers wanted the consumer to use as much as possible in one sitting and so the bottles were designed with a open neck slightly smaller than a catchup bottle and used xanthan gum apparently to thicken the product, making it pour out in globs, like steak sauce. This sauce also had vegetable oil and tomato paste in it.<br />Because of the cost, lack of flavor, ingredients, and bottle engineering, I would not recommend this sauce...jim

review/summary: Terrific, economical way to jack up the heat in recipes.
review/text: I bought a bottle of this stuff over two years ago and I still have some in my fridge. Rather than go for the extreme pain by pouring it on, consider using it as a way to boost the heat in an otherwise bland recipe that's supposed to be spicy.<br /><br />Say you're making a Thai stir-fry with a store-bought sauce, and as you're cooking you notice it's kind of bland. Take a TINY bit (1/4 teaspoon or less - a few drops - do this over the sink btw, not the pan) of this stuff and then add that tiny bit to the stir-fry and stir for a few minutes. Taste again. You will be amazed at how how this enhances the heat without ruining the flavor.<br /><br />I'm sure there are a ton of similar or more potent (yeesh) products out there but for me this is the one everyone talks about. I'm not a chili-head and I don't like agony, just a noticeable kick when preparing certain foods. I would get this one again for sure.

review/summary: Good!
review/text: This is an extract sauce, meaning that it has been chemically engineered (refined over and over) to be hotter than eating an actual pepper.  Hot sauces in the "Extract" category should only be tasted by dabbing a toothpick in it.  Only a fool would drop some on a chip.<br /><br />Yes this stuff is hot.  I didn't really see much of a difference between this and his insanity sauce.  Either the sauce looses its potency every time you take it out of the fridge or I have just gotten accustomed to it.  When people get into hot sauce, Dave's is usually the talk of the town for a while until you discover hotter stuff.  It's probably the most popular extract sauce. Some hottest sauces that I have tried and own are the 357 Mad Dog Silver Edition, Da' Bomb Ground Zero, Blair's Zakk Wylde (Berserker Shot to Hell).  Dave's stuff is not as hot as these (To me), these sauces are a 10, Dave's is at a 6. Every time I make a trip to the store I pick up a newer one and usually find a new "Hottest sauce I've ever had".  Next on the list is Satan's Blood and Smack my but, smack heard around the world.<br /><br />My Fav best-tasting sauce would be The Hottest Fn Sauce, Tabasco brand Habanero (It's cheap, widely available, and tastes great with some burn).<br /><br />Getting back to Dave's, I like and respect his sauce because of its roots and iconic heritage. It paved the way to all the Extract sauce we now have. But the taste of this, his insanity, and the ghost pepper sauces are not my fav.  Try some of his other tamer sauce (hurtin Habanero, garlic, etc) for better flavor.

review/summary: Product is Truthfully HOT!
review/text: I received my bottle of Dave's Ultimate Insanity Hot Sauce today, and after reading dozens of reviews about mixed experiences, I was becoming skeptical about if it was really that hot. My bottle seamed new, and sauce wasn't globby. It was nice, and pure. I (poured)a little bit and tried it on a taco. The following things happened,<br />1. My throat caught A flame and began to accelerate in heat.<br />2. My tongue was next as I began to chew.<br />3. I swallowed the bite quickly as a reaction to extinguish the heat (yeah right..)<br />4. Thinking smart I poured a glass of milk, and drank, and drank, and drank....<br />5. Going through a few glasses the pain was nice, and hot. I was happy to know the sauce wasn't a lie.<br />6. 15 minutes pass, and the flame was extinguished I was happy that the sauce was really hot, and so was my mouth a very nice addition to any meal for a real spice, I'm sure it would be great for chili.

review/summary: Searing Burning Riot Napalm
review/text: So I'm on the train and this woman tells me how her kids in the summer put hot sauce on sunflower seeds and bake 'em and they are amazing and hot. WOW. I couldn't wait to get my hands on sunflower seeds and hot sauce. So I go to the Wayne Farmers Market and my co-worker is in a rush, and I find the Head Nut and get the sunflower seeds in the shell and I ask her for a generic hot sauce, nothing too hot and I'm in a rush. And she gives me Dave's Ultimate Insanity and says its one of her milder sauces and I'm happy.<br />So I get to work, and put some seeds in a bowl and put 3 drops of Dave's in the bowl and mix it around the shells and then put the bowl in the microwave for 30 seconds and I now have cooked hot nuts.<br />So I start eating them and mind you only the shells have the sauce on them, but it looks like the microwave has evaporated the sauce. Bummer. But I eat them anyway, and they're ar first pretty hot, but after 5 minutes it's like I've swallowed riot Naplam right out of Vietnam. So basically I'm under attack by Dave and I'm burning up and I rub my face and my eyes and now the Napalm is in my eyes and they are burning and my lips feel like someone gave them a vigorous Ben Gay massage.. So basically this stuff is the real deal...Hot as hell..almost like a chemical hot, cause it's kind of hard to discern any flavor....But I was having some stomach problems that week and really weird like the problems went away, almost as if Dave's is some kind of magic elixir, just burned it right out of me. This is the hottest stuff I have ever encountered. Ever. So if you're into a kick and half, you should try this stuff. But only one drop.

Because of how spicy it is, it's best to not touch it directly with your hands, not breathe in any cooking fumes while you are cooking with it, not taste it directly in any amount, and to be careful about the permeability of the substances it is coming in contact with, for example cutting boards, plastic silverware, and sponges (for washing).

review/summary: Not your average "hot" hot sauce
review/text: I love hot sauce!  The label on this sauce doesn't lie...it is insanely hot!  Like I said, I love hot sauce and it is difficult for me to put a drop of this directly on my tongue and swallow by itself.  There are YouTube videos of guys taking this stuff by the teaspoon full...yipes!  I can't imagine what Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce is like as it is supposedly hotter than this one.  The sauce has pretty good flavor and doesn't disappoint in the "hotness" arena AT ALL!  My assessment from an average bowl of soup:<br />1 drop in the bowl - Good flavor, nice hot for your tastebuds.<br />2 drops in the bowl - Still decent flavor enhances the soup, eyes watering, Kleenex and a glass of H2O probably a good idea.<br />3 drops - Soup starting to lose it's flavor, nose running, eyes pouring water, heart racing, begin to feel your hair stand on end.  Grab a gallon jug o water.<br />4 drops - No soup flavor can be detected as it's all hot lava taste at this point, no more trimming nose hairs...they're gone, your whole body is sweating, you may think you see a smoke plume coming from your ear, and you're pretty sure you see a vision of your dead grandmother standing in front of you.  Forget drinking water...you head for the nearby fire hydrant.<br />Bottom Line...if you are looking for hot, this should do the trick.  Worth the 6 bucks at your local grocery.

review/summary: sauce that makes you sweat
review/text: I just made myself a nice taco salad with Chipotle dressing.  For kicks I added two drops of Dave's Ultimate Insanity Hot Sauce that I bought yesterday.  Four bites into my salad, I'm already sweating, fanning my mouth as if it actually helps cool me down (no this does not work).  I LOVE spicy food, and I find that I continuously try to challenge myself to see how hot I can go.  This is by far the hottest sauce I have ever come across.  Like other reviewers, I noticed this sauce does not have a strong flavor - it's mostly just heat with a nice smokey hint to it.  I actually prefer this!  I used to have to drown my food in Tabasco sauce in order to get it hot enough to my liking, but the strong vinegary flavor of Tabasco ends up overpowering my already tasty food.  Dave's Ultimate Insanity allows me to enjoy the flavors of my food while adding the extra kick (more like an explosion) of heat that I desire.

It's definitely only something that should be used in tiny quantities to spice up food. I put about 1-2 teaspoons in a regular bowl of soup or chili and you can definitely see the taste and the dark red color from it. It's hot yeah, definitely as you start using it, but after a month or so it's not too bad. Now I'm looking for the next step up.

review/summary: Great Sauce-Slightly Disappointed
review/text: I had previously become addicted to the original Dave's Insanity Sauce after randomly coming across it in a nearby Target store. After becoming bored with all the other common sauces on the market I decided to give Mr. Dave's a shot. I instantly loved the burn that the original contained. I used it as a regular hot sauce, coating everything I could in the stuff. However, I became tolerant and wanted something more. Behold the Ultimate Insanity Sauce which I just had to order and received in the mail today. I have to say it was only slightly hotter than the original and was disappointed that it was not more. I still plan to use this as a sauce on burritos, chicken, salads, etc. On another note, it is not a MUST that you only use sparingly as some have mentioned. You just have to enjoy high heat sauces and have a tolerance for them. As for people including the unimportant "burns on the way out" comments...no one really cares to hear you speak of that. And for the record my stomach is used to it and it does not have said effect on me whatsoever. Bottom line great hot sauce for cooking or like me everyday use. Side note: I ate 2 tablespoons of original on You Tube and plan on doing this one as well. Search: "Dave's Insanity Bitch Slap" and enjoy.
