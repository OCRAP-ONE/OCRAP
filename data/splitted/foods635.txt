review/summary: Keeps weight on my cat
review/text: My cat has chronic renal failure and often doesn't want to eat. He will always eat this, and while I try not to give him fish every day (or tuna ever), I will let him have a can of this 2-3 times a week if needed. It's such a treat for him and I feel better seeing him eat with gusto. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Test drive Miracle Whip
review/text: I had noticed this item show up in the grocery isles but the price was hardly a buy. Found this in the warehouse sale and thought I would try it, since the price was better than I was paying for the generic dressing. As usual Miracle Whip has a good product. It was lite and creamy and had a good taste, not like some of the generic  brands that taste oily or have no taste at all. Very good product just needs a price adjustment.

review/text: There's just something about Tapioca Pudding that makes me happy.  Definitely my favorite.  Until recently, I would just buy the Kozy Shack pre packaged tapioca pudding from the grocery in the refrigerated section; however, it has risen in price to the point where it is much more economical to make the cook and serve Jell-o brand, which tastes fresher and can be served warm or cold (or frozen in an ice tray similar to pudding pops (or poppers).  Also, no more worrying about the expiration date like you do with the refrigerated ones.<br /><br />When purchased from Amazon via their promo sales, you can get a package of this for .50.  Add in the price of 2 cups of milk (another .50), and you've made 4 servings of this for $1.  Definitely a bargain!

review/summary: Tired of the usual?
review/text: The front of the box boasts, "Low Sodium - No Cholesterol - Low Fat". "100% Pure Roasted Whole Grain Buckwheat". "Wheat & Gluten Free".<br /><br />Ingredients: "100% pure buckwheat - contains no additives, fortifiers or preservatives."<br />"170 calories per 1/4 cup serving. About 3/4 cup prepared."<br /><br />Flavor? That depends on you. The directions recommend adding bouillon but a lot of bouillon just winds up being chunks of MSG. Most recently I tried adding some jamaican jerk flavoring and it worked well. You can use this as a base, throwing other ingredients, veggies, etc. to turn this into your own creation. This cooks up in maybe fifteen minutes.<br /><br />Only drawback, which may not be a nuisance to you, is that preparation as directed uses two pans, one to boil the liquid ingredients and a second to griddle up the kasha with egg coating before combining the two into one pan. That's not enough of a drawback to prevent me from stocking up on more Wolff's Kasha.

review/text: I saw the review that gave a 1 star without actually receiving the product.  While I agree with that review that the contents should be listed, a simple web search revealed that this product is in fact (an all important point by the way) sweetened with Aspartame.<br /><br />If you are someone like me that likes tonic with their beverages but simply cannot stand diet tonic that is readily available due to the use of Saccharin as a sweetener (which makes me literally ill in tonic) then this *may* be a product for you.<br /><br />Is it as good as regular tonic (Canada Dry, Shwepps, store brands, or the premiums like Fever Tree)? - NO.<br /><br />Is it a livable substitute if you want to avoid the hundreds of calories? - YES.  It does however put a damper on your Gin or Vodka if you buy Premium brands.<br /><br />There are other Aspartame-sweetened diet tonic brands available that I have not tried due to the enormous shipping costs involved.

review/summary: A Light and Delicious Snack
review/text: I have always loved cheese puffs but finding the perfect one was difficult.<br /><br />Cheeto's "Dangerously Cheesy" Cheese Puffs were disgusting. I do not think their "cheese" is even real cheese. I wanted something plainer and healthier for myself.<br /><br />I have tired smaller companies but they always ended getting bankrupt or discontinuing their plaining cheese puffs.<br /><br />Finally, I tried Smart Puffs from my local supermarket. I was a little skeptical; they were so cheap! When I got home and popped one in my mouth, I was so surprised each puff was lightly covered in cheese. Each puff was not completely crunchy; they sort of slowly melt in your mouth as you chew!<br /><br />I will definitely recommend anyone who looking for a healthy snack alternative this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />A healthy snack<br />Lightly covered in cheese<br />Delicious, too!<br /><br />Cons:<br />It is so hard to put down a bag!

review/summary: A Mouthful of air
review/text: This is a snack that I can't find in our local markets.  I ordered a case of puffs from amazon.com on a whim.  Shoping for food online was a first for me. When this huge box arrived my wife and I couldn't believe the size of it.  We had a good laugh unpacking 24 bags of Smart Puffs and ate one bag full right away.  The puffs tasted quite good and with the reasonably healthful ingredients they contain we did not feel guilty eating them.<br /><br />The puffs have a pleasant natural cheese taste.  However, eating Gourmet Smart Puffs is a somewhat startling experience. Pop a couple of the puffs into your mouth chew a few times and it feels like a crunchy mouthful of cheesy air.  Is that strange or what?<br /><br />I think I would like a bit more substance to my snacks, but I guess one can't have it all and still remain reasonably healthy.  Smart puffs do not seem like junk food.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, your fingers do not get all yellow eating Smart Puffs.  I have ordered my second case of Robert's Smart Puffs.

review/text: Yes, I do like the taste of these cheese puffs.  Enough said about taste.  Here's the issue -->  Get a bag, look at the nutritional information and ask yourself "How many calories are in a bag of these puffs?"  Your initial answer will likely be 140 calories as that is what is printed on the bag of "about 1" servings.  In actuality, the bag is 1 3/8 oz or 1.375 oz.  So, there is over 190 calories in a bag which is more that 1/3 more calories than what you observe via a fast look at the nutritional info on the bag.  I consider this devious at the very least.  Now, is that not so SMART or what??

review/text: The best thing about these is the smell when you first open the bag - pure white cheddar goodness.  Too bad they don't taste like that.  The first few are good, but when I ate more than 5 or 6 'puffs', I got an acidic taste in my mouth.  At that point, most of the cheddar flavor went away.  If you're ok with eating one small handful of these, by all means, buy away - you'll be pleased.  Otherwise, they're just ok, not great.  At least they're not as bad for you as other snacks of this type.

review/summary: Good, but............
review/text: They taste GREAT but the packaging sucks!  I can count on one hand the number of packages that were NOT opened, even a tiny bit.  As I don't eat them every day, I only recently discovered the problem.  The contents the open bags (even the ones with the tiny opening, usually in the bottom) are stale, some more so than others.  If you order an entire box, check EACH bag....

review/summary: Great cheese puff, relatively low calorie
review/text: These puffs are great to have around when you crave a crunchy, cheezy, salty snack that's not too bad for you. Only 140 Calories per bag compared to about 230 calories for similar sized Cheetos Puffs.

review/summary: good alternative  snack
review/text: while no junk food or snack food is actually good for us...this one comes close to being satisfying for a salty snack with lots of  cheesy taste but without the strange ingredients of the other popular cheese puff brands.  I like them.  Light and they  do not upset the system with additives and colorings.  A little too addictive with all the salt but if you can be disciplined this is a good alternative when you simply must have something crunchy and salty to eat.  I would buy them again.  No orange fingers and no weird carb feeling after eating them.

review/summary: Smart Puffs Real Wisconsin Cheddar
review/text: Boy was I dissapointed in these babies.  I thought that they would taste like an actually puff, but they tasted like nothing, honestly. I love pirates booty, that is my favorite and one that I am going to stick to.  These taste like a very very weark version of pirates booty, no flavor to speak of at all and not worth the money.  So I would buy a bag at a store first to try before purchasing online in a large amount.  Dont expect much flavor or anything form this snack, unless your into eating flavorless food.

Besides the taste these are 10X less bad for you than Cheetos.  The only bad thing is that you can kill the bag in 2 or 3 sittings and not even realize it.

review/text: For me - these are great - they're light and crunchy without the bright orage residue of others.  My baby loves these (she's not been spoiled by others kinds) and my older boys don't care for them.  they prefer other kinds of chips.  I think if you start them very young or try them later once the kids are old enough to grasp the idea of nutrition - they'll be a big hit.  I personally prefer the taste of these over other brands and other types of salty, crunchy snacks.

At over thirty bucks a case these are quite expensive.  Grab these when they go on sale for under twenty bucks.

review/text: I bought these because my daughter wanted something for a school snack, had tried these in the cafeteria and said that they "weren't bad".  Unfortunately, she had changed her mind by the time the gigantic box  arrived on the doorstep.  My huband and I tried them, and I feel like giving a stern punishment to the maker of these things.  Besides having no discernable nutritional content, these things have too much salt, too much fake "cheez" powder, and no way to remove it gracefully after you'e eaten a few puffs. We don't like them, and I feel terrible dumping them on the food pantry. Perhaps I'll hide them in a large donation of healthier items.

review/summary: Black salt is phenomenal!
review/text: Due to my studies in yoga and Ayurveda I'd heard about the benefits of black salt.  I'm so glad I decided to try it.  It's made a wonderful and interesting addition to my food preparation.  I would recommend that anyone buying it read up on it first because it does have a very unusual odor and flavor (very much like hard boiled eggs, as it is volcanic and contains a lot of sulphur) and the fact that like Himalayan salt you use it as a finishing salt and don't cook it.  Like Himalayan salt, from what I understand, black salt doesn't hold water so it's said it doesn't raise the sodium content in the body.  It's very finely ground so a little goes a long way, and it comes in a really neat little glass jar.  I would definitely purchase again!

We wanted a lemon cake one day for a special birthday for my husband's celiac mother.  We used a little lemon extract and lemon zest in the cake.  After it was baked we mixed a little sugar with lemon juice, heated it and poured in on top the cake after first poking the cake with a toothpick to create small holes for absorbing our yummy sweetened lemon concoction.  Sorry I can't tell you my proportions as I simply guessed (a habitual way of approaching cooking for me).  Think creatively and enjoy, knowing that you're starting with a great base!

I've made two so far: first, a pineapple "upside-down cake" (butter a sheet pan, add brown sugar, place canned pineapple rings and cherries on the bottom and juice from the can in the mix).  Poured on the mix and baked as directed on the package.Guests loved it.  Second, I added ground nuts and almond flavoring to the mix, poured it into a bundt pan, and after baking poured a lemon glaze on top.  Delicious.<br /><br />Wish this mix could be healthier.  Ingredients are inferior to the chocolate cake mix, but oh well, cake is supposed to be a dessert.

I made this cake and frosted it with a non-dairy topping and added fruit on top.  It was soo good and everyone else liked it too.  There are so many ways to change out this cake mix by adding ingredients. That's why I orded a pack of 4.  If you are trying to go gluten free, try this product. If you didn't tell everyone it was gluten free they really wouldn' know.  I love ordering from Amazon using Prime as there are no shipping costs and the products come right away.

I whipped up some heavy cream, and cut up strawberries and sprinkled with sugar (so they got juicy), and made a 2- layer cake with a heap of cream and strawberries over each layer. It was scrumptious! No one even knew it was gluten-free! Everyone at our dinner party had a second helping and told me it was fabulous. So easy!

review/summary: another gluten-free winner from Bob's Red Mill!
review/text: I am eating gluten-free and must also be rice-free (due to allergy). I thought I'd never eat another piece of cake again. I was wrong!  I made some buttercream icing out of 10X sugar, butter, vanilla and water. My husband said this cake was awesome!  It was quick and easy to make.  Simple snip that bag and pour into mixing bowl.  Baked up perfectly, slightly browned, and tasted great! This is a must if you eat gluten-free!

review/summary: Not so great
review/text: I'm an avid vanilla freak, and this cake looked like a score. However ,the top would not become firm despite following its directions. Also had a mealy consistency. Not a fan. Half my cake was tossed in the garbage. I recommend Dowd & Rogers cake mix, and 'Cause You're Special cake mixes, because we know you are special :)

review/summary: Hard to believe it's gluten free
review/text: Sort of followed the directions, mixed in a Kitchenaid stand mixer with the K paddle.  After beating the eggs and adding the cake mix, i dropped in a half cup of soft butter flavor crisco and creamed it in.  Then I added a half cup of unsweetened vanilla soy milk. Mixed as directed.  Baked in a dutch oven with the lid on in my kitchen oven @350F with the convection fan running.  Cooked to 200F~210F internal temp.  Just brilliant very close match to how I remember a wheat flour cake tasting.  Great crumb.  Highly recommended. As I'm a fan of hot Rooibos tea without sugar and no sugar added pie fillings the sweetness was perfect for me.  Very easy to add sugar or Splenda to increase the sweetness.  I suspect that the older reviews may (educated guess on my part) reflect an older formulation of this product.  I got my four pack in March 2012.

review/text: I like Bobs Red Mill products because they are not hiding behind deceptive label practices. What you read on the label is what you get.<br /><br />I no longer by prepackaged or processed foods because they all have a tendency to lie. If you pay for a product you deserve to know exactly what is in it. White lies are still lies.

review/text: I wasn't happy with this product unless it was made with real eggs, then it was still a bit dense and sweet for my taste.  I much prefer Bob's Red Mill's awesome chocolate cake.  Both benefit from mixing in some extra vanilla.  So, not to be avoided, but I don't use it much.

review/summary: Not sweet at all. Great look and feel.
review/text: We are very new to baking and eating gluten free. This cake was easy to bake. It did not get eaten because of the lack of taste. It did not taste like a cake. It was not sweet at all. It was more like wheat bread. Half the cake got thrown out. I think we needed to add "something" to the mix to make it sweet and it would have been a hit with my kids. I personally would NOT recommend unless you know how to add stuff to a recipe.

review/text: This cake mix was all the things that a cake should be moist, soft, finely textured and delicious.  If there was one complaint to be made it would be that it was a litte too sweet for my personal taste but nobody else thought this way.  I bought this for my son but gave it to some gluten eaters who said that they could not tell the difference and wanted to eat more!  This makes it a winner in my book.

review/summary: harsh taste
review/text: I found this mix to have a strong bean taste to it.  I tried it a couple of times.  First just the way the mix says, which I did not like the taste at all nor did my hubby.  The 2nd time I added some vanilla to the mix in which did give it a bit of a better taste and was something my hubby said he would eat.  For me over all just to much bean of a flavor and I will never by it again.

review/summary: Scottish shortbread at its finest.
review/text: Over the course of fifteen consecutive years, I have eaten many brands of shortbreads made in Scotland.  Of all of these, I enjoy Borders brand the best.  The owners of a small English tea shoppe, where I orginally purchased Borders brand, retired from their business.  That left me not knowing where to find a new seller.  However, I was fortunate to find the product available through Amazon.

I have never had better quality chocolate (okay I have had some amazing Swiss chocolate).  All their products are excellent, we really love the black sesame crunch, especially my Arabic husband, who may be a little bit of a sesame seed snob.  Did I mention this is GLUTEN FREE!!!  Bissinger's web site specifies gluten free on many items.  The service from Bissinger's is truly 5 star.

review/text: The taste on this is wonderful, and you don't have to feel guilty about indulging! Has a decent amount of protein, low carbs and the sugars are very reasonable (I am someone who watches sugars, carbs and protein very carefully).  So this is a treat that not only do I feel good eating but tastes heavenly! A wee bit pricey, yes. But if you are someone who wants awesome taste and is really sticking to a more healthier lifestyle than this product will NOT disappoint you.

review/summary: Great product, but sneaky manufacturer
review/text: I have been a big fan of Dreamfields pasta and have recommended it often, however, I am quite irritated at the manufacturer at the moment.  They recently changed box sizes from 16 to 13.25 ounces and kept the price the same.  This product is already higher priced than most other brands of pasta; I justified the price because of the reduced carbs and comparable taste to regular pasta products, but the sudden reduction from 16 to 13.25 ounces without a drop in price has got me questioning whether I still want to purchase this product.<br /><br />I just went to Dreamfields' website to see if they had an announcement on their homepage concerning the change in size and they didn't; in my opinion a change of this magnitude deserves some mention on their  homepage.  The company sent no announcement of the size change via email (I am on their mailing list). I think the consumer at least deserves an explanation.  Not doing so is bad customer service and there is something about it that seems sneaky to me.

review/summary: very sneaky people- HARDLY LOW CARB, but less carbs than regular pasta
review/text: Here's what it says over the label-  Total Carbs 41, Fiber -5, Protected Carbs -31 = digestible carbs 5<br /><br />Now, what the hell are "protected carbs"?  No one knows.  This is a term that the company coined themselves.  And they don't really give any explaination either.  When you go on their website they claim that these "protected carbs" are not digestible.  Really?  Well then why don't you go ahead and tell us what exactly they are then?<br /><br />I asked 2 nutritionists about this and they both told me that they are familiar with Dreamfields Pasta and both stated it is a scam that uses tricky wording on their labels!  One nutritionist told me that her patients would have no insulin spike but then 4 hours after eating the pasta suddenly it would spike drastically.  She believes all this pasta does is slow the digestion to a point where it tricks people for a few hours into thinking they are taking in only 5 carbs.  Both doctors said that the real net carb content of this pasta is actually around 36.  Which is still less than other pastas, but not by much.  I eat this pasta as I am not diabetic and it does taste good and have less carbs, but I have diabetic relatives and I would never cook it for them.  When I'm done with the dreamfields I have left over I'm going to try Carba-Nada pasta...which isn't really low carb, but it's lower than Dreamfields and they don't have tricky nutrition labels.  Haven't tried it yet though so I can't comment on it any more than that.

review/summary: Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/text: It tastes great but doesn't stand up to scientific testing on its claim of "low-carb" or their other marketing.  Dreamfield's is a fraud.  Just search for National Institute of Health on their findings for this pasta and its affect on blood.  In part "In 10 people without diabetes, the Dreamfields pasta product we purchased did not result in an improved glucose excursion when compared with a commercially available traditional pasta product as would have been expected based upon the company's claim."<br /><br />Do your own research folks!

review/text: My wife is a pasta lover and diabetic. Although we do not count the carbs as 5g (that would be a free food) we count it as 2 servings (30gs instead of all 42g). Our dietitian says preliminary investigations look promising but the jury is still out regarding the amount of carbohydrate effect on blood sugar levels of diabetics (types 1 and 2) but that it is a good source of fiber. Good tasting and good source of fiber, Dreamfield's Pasta in moderation, works very well for us.

review/summary: Great taste, low carbs
review/text: First the taste - I'm a huge pasta lover and this tastes just as good to me as any pre-made pasta I've ever had. It's also completely filling and satisfying.<br /><br />I'm pre-diabetic and so far seem to have elevated blood sugar only in the mornings, so this may not be relevant to people with full diabetes, but here are the results of my tests. An evening meal including a double portion of Dreamfields and 30 grams of carbs from another dish gave me a modest rise in blood sugar, about what I'd expect from a 40-50 gram meal. On another occasion when I ate a double portion of Dreamfields alone in the late morning, my blood sugar had dropped slightly six hours later. I had read a couple of people complaining that they got high readings eight hours or so after eating Dreamfields but this doesn't seem to happen to me.<br /><br />Extra fiber is always another plus. With the lowered carbs Dreamfields should also be lower calorie but there don't seem to be any official claims for that.<br /><br />Again according to my readings: don't overcook it, reheat it, or cook it in something acidic like tomato sauce or the carb-hiding effect will be lost. (It's fine to add tomato sauce after the pasta is cooked.)<br /><br />The only drawback is the price, but it's well worth it to be able to eat pasta and not be concerned about the carbs.

review/text: I have been using Dreamfield's Pasta for the past year. It tastes amazing. In fact, I like it better than regular pasta. It never clumps together when cooked. As a recently diagnosed Diabetic, I have noted that my blood sugars do not soar up following a Dreamfield's Pasta meal. That's a bonus given that most high carb meals cause a huge peak in blood sugars. We don't have it available locally so I order it through Amazon and it usually arrives within a week. Great product and will continue to purchase it.
