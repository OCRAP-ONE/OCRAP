review/summary: These are pretty great
review/text: They have sugar and probably artificial whatever, they're not organic, blah blah blah. They're tasty and super convenient (I have them delivered to my office via subscribe and save; doesn't get much more convenient than that). That is what I was looking for, and that is what these are. They have big fruit pieces and crunchy nuts and... oaty oats. I think the apple is the best flavor, though the peach was pretty good and the berry quite acceptable (if a bit tart). Haven't tried the cherry because I don't like cherries.<br /><br />I do recommend using more water than to-the-line; I fill it to a good centimeter or so (it's kinda imprecise) above the line, and let it sit awhile to absorb.

review/text: I saw these items advertised and thought they looked like they might be good and would like to try them. I looked at the Amazon item and found them @ 12 for 24.75 and thought WOW!. If I bought them and did not like, I was out a bunch of cash.<br />I went to the local Mart and found them for a buck fifty, bought one each of three flavors.I found them to be quite good, liked them and they are quick and easy.<br />I will buy them again but not from Amazon.<br />I am a prime member and after a year I found that, for the most part prime is a scam that needs to be looked into by the Gov.<br />The inflated prices on items more than pays for the cost of shipping and handling.The Prime membership fee then is pure profit.<br /><br />I will probably, buy from Amazon, one time items but not items bought on a regulsr basics.<br />Any one who has an over abundance of cash, please post here and I wll contasct you asI could sure ise it.

review/summary: Better than expected, generous amount of peach, and mostly whole oats
review/text: These are fast, convenient, easy, and tasty. Sized about right for a good breakfast, especially if you add an apple or other fruit, or some cheese. What I was not expecting was how good it would taste, the amount of peach, and the whole oats. There is enough peach for some in every bite, although not as much almonds. The downside as others have stated is how much sugar there is. But overall for getting me to eat my oatmeal and for being satisfying and tasty, this is a definite recommend.

review/text: I tried this kind for the first time through Amazon.  I am very limited when it comes to grocery shopping and use Amazon to get the stuff I can not find.  This product was very good.  I liked the containers and will only buy these containers again.  The berry flavor of the oatmeal was delicious.  Very easy for a person like me to prepare (handicapped).  I would recommend this oatmeal to everyone.

review/text: This Quaker Oatmeal with wild berries is the most delicious oatmeal I have ever eaten. I received some a few months ago as a food gift.<br />I was unable to find it locally. I called the Quaker Oats Company to ask where I could purchase it and was told it was unavailable in my County. I was so disappointed. I went to Amazon.com and typed in the product name. Bam!

review/text: We adore this oatmeal.  I was surprised at how good the ingredients list was and the taste is wonderful!  Large dried cherries, plenty of pistachios and I believe there are even almonds as well as multi-grains.  We reordered in different flavors hoping to find them as tasty.  We even ate it uncooked with milk...still yummy and quick as we are always running out the door to work, some class...whatever.  Great, quick breakfast item!

review/text: I just tried the peach almond this morning and love it.  I can't wait to try all the other flavors that I also purchased.  The convenience is great and you don't have to find a cup or bowl for microwaving.  Due to the cost, another reviewer mentioned to make your own.  I do not agree with this at all.  By the time you purchase the oatmeal, peaches, nuts, etc. that are in each of these, you would be spending a lot more than what these cost.  I will continue to purchase these for breakfast at work!

They were easy to make and tasted good compared to 'regular' oatmeal I have tried. It was a bit too sweet for me but I still liked it. Going to get a big pack and stack these up.

review/summary: Excellent, delicious, healthy, portable breakfast
review/text: I was skeptical at a "summer berry" oatmeal. It's difficult to reconstitute berries, but Quaker has managed to do it. It's slightly sweeter than I might like, but otherwise delicious.<br /><br />It's important to follow the microwave directions exactly, especially stirring before microwaving. Failure to do so will result in lumpiness and an inconsistent texture. It's ready in just 45 seconds, which is perfect when racing out the door to work.<br /><br />Also note that this is results in a thicker oatmeal than you might be used to. However, it's delicious and just right.<br /><br />It also contains 8 grams of protein, which is more than many breakfast cereals (excluding milk).<br /><br />I also keep a few at the office for those mornings I wasn't able to grab breakfast before I left.<br /><br />I've tried several other flavors <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007N04BY6">Quaker Real Medleys Peach Almond Oatmeal</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007N04AF6">Quaker Real Medleys Apple Walnut Oatmeal</a>, and this is by far my favorite.<br /><br />The Peaches in the Peach Almond are great, but the almonds don't work as well for the texture and flavor; I will not reorder this flavor. The Apple Walnut is what you'd expect for an Apple Walnut oatmeal. It's good, but not great. I will reorder it for variety.<br /><br />I'll definitely order the berry flavor again.

review/summary: LOVE this Granola!
review/text: This granola is super tasty and also healthy. The ingredients are pure and simple, there are no surprises when you read the label.<br /><br />I have not tried the other flavors that Love Grown makes, but this "Sweet Cranberry Pecan" is to die for! It's got a cinnamon and pecan taste and the dried cranberries give it a chewy texture when you get one in your bite. It's not overly sweet, just about the perfect amount of sweetness for my taste.<br /><br />To the reviewer who gave this product 1 star and said it was not clustered - sounds like your bag got smashed. That is probably the fault of whoever handled it either during storage, packing, or shipping and it's not the fault of the manufacturer. This stuff is clustered, crunchy and delicious!<br /><br />The only problem is that it's addictive! You might find yourself wishing you had ordered more :)<br /><br />Good job Love Crunch, I'll be trying some of the other flavors next.

It has made me reconsider granola. Plus, the story of the founders is really sweet. I must admit that added to the experience. I especially love the Apple-Walnut, but those I've tried (which is all except the cocoa) have been delicious.

review/summary: They think it's "people food"!
review/text: I have previously praised Cesar dog food as being the only thing my finicky mademoiselle will deign to eat. Well, that didn't last. She figured out I was hiding her pills in it and that was that. So I cast about looking for something different enough to entice her, and fell upon CHEF MICHAEL's.<br /><br />She loves it. Snarfs it.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />1) It isn't vile; some varieties smell like it's homemade.<br /><br />2) Related to above, it is even a convincing "Oh they're giving me people food!"<br /><br />3) It gets eaten. Other foods sit ignored and wind up in the trash. Even the very similar BENEFUL chicken stew. I don't understand it!<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />1) It's expensive!<br /><br />2) It's a teeny serving. This is for the smallest of breeds or lightest eaters. Gigi is sometimes still hungry after dinner. She's begun having two Beggin Strips for breakfast to get her through.<br /><br />Honestly, if Gig ate anything else, I wouldn't buy this. Maybe if I had a mini Yorkie or something under ten pounds. I don't really recommend it for dogs bigger than that, because it's so little.<br /><br />I know overfeeding is a problem, and we tend to think of portions on our scale rather than theirs. But when my picky eater is poking around her dinner bowl and licking it an hour after eating, it tells me she's still hungry. It's a tricky matter!

review/summary: petroleum derived FD&C Blue 1 = extreme GI distress :-(
review/text: Over the years my parents would send me to school and I was just fine until usually either lunch or a snack time with the school or a well-meaning room parent providing grape or fruity colored sugary drinks... or bright colorful candies.. or maybe mom splurged on those bright colorful cereals for breakfast. YUM!  Every kids dream, right?<br /><br />Well each  time I consumed some of these brightly colored cereals or pastries or drinks or candies, over the next few hours I would develop at least mild stomach pain. The deeper the color or the more I consumed, the worse the experience. Eventually it ended with me locked in the bathroom, doubled over in pain, for hours on end, as perplexed school officials called my parents to come get me, as I was AGAIN being sent home from school.  I was soo embarrassed. Pity the few subs who refused me a hall pass - I remember vomiting at my desk more than a few times to the stunned sub who hadn't realized how seriously I had GI issues. If I say I need a hall pass, I meant I *needed* a pass.<br /><br />Growing up as a teenager, dad remarried and my stepmother didn't buy much colorful "kids" drinks n such anymore. Wow, what a change, I even managed a year of perfect attendance! Me?! The kid who averaged 20+ days out sick from school had perfect attendance! My grades improved! I felt better....<br /><br />Then as a young adult, I was trying to kick the soda bucket and went back to the colorful sugary drinks of my youth. The abdominal pain and diarrhea was unreal. I began missing some college classes and my grades slipped. I was having some difficulty at work with a male boss who did not understand, he even implied I was lazy. Really? I was going to college full-time while working in a factory with forced overtime and tutoring on the side. It wasn't my fault I had a sensitive stomach....<br /><br />...until one day I was at home with one of the really bad episodes, doubled over in pain with diarrhea again and it suddenly hit upon me. GRAPE KOOL-AID.  I had consumed a whole pitcher of GRAPE KOOL-AID that day before getting ready for work (2nd shift). I read through the label... RED 40 and BLUE 1 stuck out...  so I stooped drinking grape Kool-Aid and went back to Pepsi for awhile. Symptoms stabilized... until one day when I had a tuna lunchable. A small attack convinced me to read labels- there was BLUE 1 again.<br /><br />I was 25 years old when I made the "BLUE 1 DISCOVERY". I am now in my 40s. I have since learned to avoid lotions, mouthwash, dish soap, GRAPE KOOL-AID and even "white marshmallows".  Since learning to avoid BLUE 1 including GRAPE KOOL-AID my life has significantly improved.<br /><br />I discovered very serious and relevant information about BLUE 1 from the FDA website... the term "BLUE 1" and "causally linked to fatalities" was significant enough for me that I wrote to the medical doctor who issued the press release; we shared a number of interesting email exchanges.<br /><br />I  have learned some "natural" brands of "children's cereals" are made with elderberry juice for coloring. I wish KOOL-AID would change to natural colors! (If using colors at all...) Oh and I kicked the soda bucket, too. I learned what fresh squeezed lemons mixed in a glass of water with d-ribose could do for both taste AND for energy. I feel so much better!

Still, it was a good value for the money and the merchant was very timely in shipping.

review/summary: Finally, a drink that weaned me off soda
review/text: Soda is one of my big weaknesses.  But lately I've been on a diet and realized that I had to cut out all the sweet stuff, including soda.  I've always had a hard time finding a substitute drink that satisfied me (I hate diet sodas and drinks), until I came across the superfruit punch.  I like how it is mildly sweet, had less calories than a regular soda and is very refreshing.  I also like how this drink does not make me feel more thirsty.  It's a great option for people looking for a bit of sweetness in their lives, without the guilt of soda.

review/summary: Yummmmm
review/text: This juice is so delicious! It is light tasting and refreshing. I love that there are only 100 calories in a bottle, and I also love that it is not super strong tasting, like a lot of 100% juices, so it really quenches thirst. My only gripe with this product is that they actually do add sugar (not a lot though), but it's so yummy that I don't really care. :) It's also rather expensive, but I suppose that's because it is organic and the only way we can help lower organic prices is to keep buying them so they become more readily available! Organic should be the norm, not the exception!

review/summary: A lifesaver
review/text: This formula has been a real lifesaver for my son. He had a difficult time digesting every formula we tried from NeoSure to Lactose Free to Soy. Unlike the other reviews, I believe the Enflora has helped. On the can, it recommends not warming the product because it inhibits the enflora to work. I believe this to be true. In order to save money, if my son didn't drink a bottle I made because I thought he was hungry and he wasn't, I would save and warm later. It seemed as though whenever I would warm, he would scream with pain until he either gassed or pooped. Pretty much what he did with all the other formulas he was on. We use room temperature water when mixing and it seems to be the key. I would recommend giving this formula a try. It's expensive, but if it helps your baby, it's worth it. Sign-up with Enfamil online and they'll send you coupons. Good luck. I understand how difficult it is dealing with a baby in pain.

review/summary: Relief began with the first bottle!
review/text: After nearly 4 months of changing my diet, stopping my medications (not a great idea), fighting with my baby to nurse, dealing with a screaming baby every time I finally got her to eat, constipation and mucousy stools, putting her on Zantac and then Miralax, and then, finally having her refuse to eat at all; my pediatrician had me trial her on Nutramigen. The first bottle showed an amazing turn around!!! After the office visit I was out and didn't have any bottles so I did one last nursing which she fought the whole way through. The next feeding I gave her a bottle of Nutramigen and she calmly drank, finished the whole thing and burped easily. No struggling, no crying, no pain! Just a calm, happy, baby, finally! Admittedly it's taken a few weeks to get past her mucousy stools, constipation and she still needs the Zantac but I am so happy this formula exists.<br /><br />Another good thing is that it doesn't smell like normal formula. Not being used to formula, this was a relief for me.<br /><br />Cons: it's not cheap and it's quite hard to find coupons or cheap prices. Most annoyingly is that it's very difficult to find multi-can packs with the 19.8 oz cans. It's mostly just the 12.6 oz cans. It works out cheaper than buying the larger cans since they aren't coming in discounted packs but it just seems so wasteful to have all these little cans to throw out.<br /><br />Typically this formula causes an increase in frequency and runniness of stools. For us that's a good thing since she also has a bad problem with constipation (actually managed to have a BF baby that was constipated tho it's not 'supposed' to happen). She still doesn't stool daily yet but after 3 weeks she's up to every other or every 2 days (from over a week between). The stool smells aweful, though!<br /><br />If your baby has a milk protein allergy, this is an excellent choice!

review/summary: Painfully expensive, but a must have if you need it. Use "SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE" for a better deal.
review/text: Nutramigen worked a miracle for my youngest child. She is one happy, stinking girl. No doubt it stinks, and it is painfully expensive, but there is nothing to compare if you really need it. I'm just glad it exists. If you use it, you probably already know its value, and you are just trying to get the best price. This review is really to make people aware of "Subscribe and Save", when you order product from Amazon itself, if you don't already know about it. It seems it is available only when you order the product from Amazon, not other vendors, which makes sense. The savings are considerable and can add up in a hurry. It also helps you quantify how much you are actually using. In our case, it was nearly double what I originally thought, which made the savings much more significant. Subscribe and Save is easy to use, update and track, and you just save money on something you must buy anyway. Once set up, be sure to go to the "Subscribe and Save" tab, at the top, to make changes to quantity and/or frequency, so you don't end up with duplicates. Great program Amazon. Thanks.

review/summary: Made all the difference in the world
review/text: From the time my son was 30 hours old, we knew something wasn't right. He began having all sorts of problems that only got worse for the 3 months that I exclusively breastfed him. He had acid reflux, stomach cramping, explosive and painful gas that hit 2 hours after he ate, foamy stools, green stools, light colored stools, fussiness at the breast, hives, eczema, rashes, diarrhea and mucus in his stools, and the final straw was blood in his stools. Not just a little, but more blood than poop. We saw several doctors and I tried several exclusion diets, the final one consisted of me only being able to eat chicken, pears, rice and potatoes. We had this poor child that was in almost constant discomfort or pain. It was gut-wrenching to watch. Our son's pediatrician, who is also a major advocate for breastfeeding, finally suggested Nutramigen. All his symptoms pretty much disappeared! He occasionally has reflux (especially if we have him on too fast of a bottle nipple) and some gas due to constipation from the formula. But we now have a child that is happy that laughs and plays. For the first 3 months, he needed constant attention, cried if he wasn't being held, and was up a lot at night. He now can lay by himself and play. He is a completely different child. We finally saw a pediatric GI and nutrition specialist who said it is food allergies to something, and that Nutramigen is the best bet until we can figure out what he is allergic to. It has broken my heart not to nurse him because I believe it is what is best for him, but I can't argue with the results we have seen since putting him on this formula. I hate the cost, but it is worth every cent. And I use the $5 coupons whenever I buy it which helps a lot. And the specialist said that if I give him probiotics (found at local health food stores), they will mimic most benefits of breastmilk. One last thing, I tried to get it covered by my insurance but was unsuccessful. But, if you have any luck at all, it will probably be with the prescription side of your insurance, not the medical part. Some will cover it if your pediatrician's office call them with all the child's clinical data and why it's a necessity. Good luck!

review/summary: More expensive for less formula, gave my baby very painful gas
review/text: My daughter has been on Nutramigen Lipil for about 5 months now for her acid reflux.  It has really helped with her spitting up and digesting the food quicker.  Since the stores in our area decided to discontinue carrying this type of formula and started stocking the Nutramigen with Enflora, I've had to switch over to using that instead.<br />For one thing, it is much more expensive.  It's a 12.6 oz can instead of a 16 oz. can.  The scoop inside is much larger so you are using more formula per bottle.  They say the reason for the scoop being larger is that the formula is less dense.  In any case, it is still costing you more money (as if it wasn't expensive enough already.)<br />In our case, our daughter is now suffering very painful gas pains, especially in the middle of the night, since we've started using this new type of formula.  She is also pooping much more frequently during the day. Before she would go about once a day, now it's about 4 times a day.<br />I've called Enfamil to see how I could obtain the original formula and they looked up their past orders to see who in my area has ordered it recently.  All the names they gave me were stores I am familiar with and have personally checked to see if they stocked it, which they do not.  Fortunately, I found a case of it here on Amazon for much cheaper then they (Enfamil) or any grocery store could ever offer.<br />I'm not sure why they felt it necessary to add Enflora to this formula if for no other reason than to make even more money.<br />I strongly recommend that if you are going to start your child on Nutramigen, to get the formula that does NOT contain Enflora.  Check with your pediatrician first to see if they have any free samples they can give you.  I am eagerly awaiting my case of Nutramigen Lipil so that I can once again enjoy a full night of sleep without waking up to my baby crying out in pain.

review/summary: It worked for me.
review/text: At about three weeks old my breastfeed son started to get fussy.  At first we thought it was just typical colic but it got worst everyday for the next week.  He was crying/screaming longer and would not calm down for hours.  It didn't seem like normal fussing.  Our doctor told us to try the Nutramigen and it really made a difference.  Since I still wanted to breastfeed, the doctor suggested I go on a dairy and wheat free diet for several weeks and then try him on breastmilk again.  My son is now 12 weeks olds and we have tried to give him breastmilk several times since starting him of the formula.  Each time we had the same result.  He would scream and kick.  He got constipated and had bad gas and wouldn't sleep much for a few days until the breastmilk was completely out of his system.  I don't know what I would do if this product was not available.  He is a happy, smiling, adorable infant when he is drinking this.  Totally worth the price!

review/summary: It really saved my sanity
review/text: I have 7 week old twin girls, and one of my girls begining at 3 weeks of age began to have uncontrolable crying especially towards the evening hours from 10-2am sometimes. Her crying wasn't a normal fussy cry it was an 'I'm in pain' cry. It was incredibly hard and frustrating not being able to do anything except push through 3-4 hours of crying while trying to care for her sister. I switched to Similac Sensitive thinking it was gas, it helped only SLIGHTLY. I was desperate so I delt with the slight help I could get, but the crying conitnued. It was frustrating looking for help online only to be told it's colic and "nothing can be done". I called my peds office which I also worked at and asked to see one of the doctors whome all I trust personally after another terrible night of her painful crying.<br />I explained the situation and the doctor said it was a possible milk protien allergy and her little body just couldn't break down the cow's milk properly and was causing upset stomach and pain. It made sense as I was a vegan and didn't drink cow's milk myself it may have effected her.<br />He gave me some Enfamil Nutramigen and said to try it out for a few days to see if there was any difference.<br />That night Friday I gave her a bottle and she did still fuss through the night, the next night after only giving her Nutramigen she cried but MUCH less. After that Saturday night she never cried her horrific cry again and the crying seemed to cease all together in the evening.<br />It's only been two weeks, but it's been such a life saver. Not just for her having no more pain and being able to sleep now with complete comfort and getting her rest, but for my sanity!! I'm finally getting some rest myself and feel peace knowing she isn't in pain and she is happy.<br />I believe this product is wonderful and would suggest anyone at least give it a shot. Not one formula works for all babies, this may not be the perfect one for some babies but it's obvious that it is for many with the milk protien condition or 'colic'.<br />The price is high but a happy healthy baby's price is worth much more.<br />I pray you all can have a happy healthy baby!

review/summary: Peace of Mind for Parents & Baby
review/text: The first week after our son was born, he was a perfect baby.  At the two week mark, he was diagnosed with a milk protein allergy, acid reflux, and colic, not to mention he wanted to be held constantly.  After giving up dairy and soy in order to breastfeed but having issues with my supply and other awful things no mother should ever have to go through that shall remain nameless, I finally caved and gave my son some of this formula which my pediatrician had given me a free sample of "just in case."  I had major guilt in even thinking about giving this to him since every breastfeeding book you read makes formula seem like the worst thing you can give your child.  I got over that in a heartbeat when I saw how quickly this formula satisfied my son.  He was like a completely different baby.  He is now a 100% formula baby and couldn't be happier.  I never used the previous "model" formula as this is our first child.  What I can say is there is no price too high to pay for the health and happiness of our son, and this formula has made us a happy family once again.

review/summary: Caviar Taste is worth the Price
review/text: Since I had my daughter, she has been through 5 different formulas before finally being able to tolerate Nutramigen.  Yes, it's expensive but so much worth the price. When your child has acid reflux, milk and soy food allergies to the point where blood and intestinal tissue is found in their stools (as mine did), the price is insignificant. Even with trying the Similac brand, Alimentum, it didn't work and she didn't like this formula.

review/summary: Only formula which gave baby a good nights sleep
review/text: We tried 4 different Enfamil formulas which worked ok for a few days and then baby would cry and cry and scream and would be up most of the night.  The baby is 5 months now and my daughter tried switching between the soy, gassless, regular formula and the baby would still scream and scream and in a painful state.  This formula is more expensive but it is worth a peaceful night for both mom and baby.  Baby does still spit up some but is in a better spirit with this formula.  Yes it is expensive but there is a reason why it is more expensive.  We did try another brand of the hypoallergenic and also had good results with it and it was also expensive.

review/text: My son has been on nutramigen since he was about 20 days old. He was unable to digest breast milk (lactose issue). After trying 4 different formulas recommended by my doctor (none of which worked), my husband and I decided to give this a try. It started working within 3 days. My son's belly distention went away, he was able to keep the formula down and have normal BM's. My son is now 10 months, happy, healthy, and still loving his nutramigen. Our doctor recommended starting to mix in other formulas (with lactose) once he reached 9 months, we tried very slowly to re-introduce them and his digestive problems started back up immediately.  So, it is nutramigen all the way for us!!!

review/text: This formula smells HORRIBLE. We have tried giving it to our daughter, because she seems to be lactose intolerant. We're on WIC in our state, and this formula is the only lactose free, non soy based formula covered. She got Baby's Only Lactose Free formula, which she loved. However, it's not covered on WIC. We have tried to move her over to Nutramigen, but she blankly refuses to drink it. If nothing else, what little she did drink, didn't upset her stomach like regular Enfamil, hence the 2 stars rather than 1.

review/summary: Bad results with this formula.
review/text: Our newborn was around 2 months old and was having some stomach issues after feeding. We tried Similac advance, Similac sensitive and Gerber good start but nothing worked to ease his digestive problems.<br />The nest step was to try something like Lipil or Alimentum and after some recommendations we went with this stuff. He would drink it without any problems but after about 4 days the problems started. Initially his bowel movements became a little watery. This gradually turned into him having some liquidous discharge in every diaper and an inflamed area around his butt. We kept him on it for about 3 more days but with the inflamed area getting worse we took him off of it. Once off his stool returned to normal and the rash or inflamed area cleared up.<br />I cannot recommend this formula at all, especially after reading numerous other bad reviews on the internet.

review/text: Our baby has reflux and a protein allergy, and despite being on Zantac, then Prevacid, along with being switched from breastmilk to Similac Alimentum, she kept getting worse.  We got desperate the day she refused to take in any fluids, and we bought a can of Enfamil's Nutramigen (with Enflora).  We weren't expecting much, and we certainly weren't expecting her to suck it down happily and hungrily!  We've stopped fighting with her to take the bottle - what a relief that mealtimes aren't a battle anymore and she's not fussy all day from hunger.  We thought the Alimentum and Nutramigen were the same, but obviously they aren't because our picky little eater won't touch the Alimentum but loves the Nutramigen.  We couldn't be happier with this formula!  So what if her stools smell horrid - she's ten times happier since we switched her, and she just keeps getting better.

His peditrician gave us a sample of the nutramigen and it worked but because it went so fast we couldnt see if it was coincidence or his own efforts...so we went back to the regular enfamil...granted we had to dialate him and irrigate him when he didnt poop so we really wanted something to work...well we finally took a chance and bought a case of nutramigen and man oh man i think hes making up for lost time...when he does poop which has been often this past week it does seem to be painful or uncomfortable but i think it because he tries to hold it in instead of releasing it as we all do. I say this because when he sleeps he passes gas freely and without problems but when hes awake its a fight...yeah this is expensive stuff but if i never have to irrigate or dialate him it works the cost of the smell (sometimes...lol) and the extra diapers then so be it...good luck

My daycare doesn't mix the formula for you, you have to bring the bottles premade in and put them in the fridge and they'll warm them up. I was noticing at daycare he would get really fussy again, but at home he was perfectly fine. We don't premake bottles at home, we make them as he gets hungry with room temperature water. We have to put gas drops in his daycare bottles, which defeats the purpose of this formula. It even says on the can it'll reduce the effectiveness of the enflora, and we figured out that if you warm it up it breaks the enflora down and makes your baby gassy. Don't warm this formula up. If you're going to warm it up get the concentrated or premade stuff because it doesn't have the enflora in it.

review/summary: Made a huge difference in my baby's quality of life.
review/text: My son was having a very difficult time with vomiting and gut pain. He also had a rash on his face. We tried Enfamil Nutramigen Lipil with Enflora to see if it would help him. After his first bottle, he fell asleep peacefully for the first time in weeks. After three days of using this product, the rash on his face was nearly gone. After nearly a month of using this product, we are very pleased with our "new", happy baby. I wish we had started using this formula earlier.<br />I also wish that amazon.com had it available as a Subscribe and Save product. It is quite expensive and I would like to be able to save a little money!

review/summary: Seems to cause more spit ups
review/text: Our pediatrician recommended switching formula to Nutramigen because switching to Soy did not seem to help my son's atopic eczema. Compared to standard Enfamil Lipil or Similac Soy it seems to cause more spit ups even though the claim is that Nutramigen is supposed to help with spit ups. Currently the only thing that is working for my son is Aquaphor moisturizing cream regardless of the formula. On the plus side, my son has not rejected this (or any of Enfamil Lipil or Similac Soy) formula outright. I'll update this posting if the pediatrician has a different observation.

review/summary: Helps with Milk Allergy
review/text: Our baby was diagnosed with a milk allergy and this helped, period.  People that complain of the smell, or taste are being silly applying adult tastes and standards to this product.  Its like the dog treats that look and smell like Oreos, silly product that's not thinking of the true customer, the dog, or in this case the baby.  All the sour candies, Spaghettios and such taste terrible to me today, too.<br /><br />Anyway, it does what w needed it to.  We haven't had any gagging, but our baby isn't a picky eater, either.  He's eaten anything and everything we've placed in his mouth with vigor, 4-5 different formula types, each sometimes mixed with gas drops, breast milk, and sometimes formula and breast milk mixed.  Warm or cold straight out of the refrigerator, he doesn't care.  So if some babies object to this, all I can say is ours didn't, but he hasn't objected to anything, yet.<br /><br />He did go within one feeding from screaming colicky discomfort back to the happy baby we had a few weeks back while Mom lets the cow milk proteins leave her system.  That's what we really needed, and it worked.  We still supplement the cow milk free breast milk with the Nutramagin, and its working fine.<br /><br />My obly reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the price.  Its ridiculous.  Solely formula feeding would cost well over $300 a month, and that's insane.

review/summary: made my baby gag!
review/text: My 7-month old son was recently diagnosed (through blood tests) with a milk allergy. He's had bad cradle cap and eczema on his face since he was about two months old. After trying MANY other formulas (Enfamil, Good Start Gentle Plus, Good Start Soy, Similac Advance, Baby's Only Soy), the doctor finally suggested going hypoallergenic. So we tried Nutramigen... he seemed okay for the first couple of minutes, then he pulled the bottle out of his mouth and gagged. I tried again... and again, he drank for a minute or two, then gagged again. Then he refused to drink any more. After reading up on hypo formulas I was expecting a bad smell, but I didn't think it'd be bad enough to make my son want to hurl!<br /><br />My son never had any problems drinking all of the other formulas; this is the only one that actually made him gag. Maybe if I had started it earlier when his tastebuds were more immature, I would've had more success. I'm hesitant to give him the Alimentum because of the high sugar content. I guess my son will just have to continue suffering with rashes until I can find a formula that works for him. :(

review/text: My daughter was having trouble keeping her formula down.  We started with Similac Advanced, then Soy, then Gerber Good Start Gentle and no matter what all she did was puke it back up.  The doctor recommended this formula and gave me some samples to try.  Within at least 3 days I noticed she wasn't spitting up pretty much at all.  A little right after she ate but nothing compared to what she used to.  She can now get through the day in the same outfit she started in and I don't have to wash burp clothes everyday.  This formula has been a lifesaver.

This company sent us the formula in a poor mans fashion (not individually wrapped or bubble wrapped) in a box that was had one sheet of crinkled paper. Five cans were damaged, including one that was busted open. The company sent us a new case, but didn't listen to us about packaging the formula. This time they used two sheets of packing paper.... one can was dented but nothing was punctured this time. I will say for the price you can't pass it, but be warned about having cans being damaged. Unless they change their packing system.

review/summary: Amazing Turnaround after switching to Nutrimigen
review/text: For the first 6 months my child suffered from massive spit-up. A huge amount after every bottle. We tried both the Similac and Enfamil anti-spit up formula, and it only helped the tiniest bit. We even had him on reflux medication, but that still only had a very minor effect. And this whole time he was cranky, and a poor sleeper, but all our children were poor sleepers, so we didn't think of it as a problem (Except for us of course). He was well over 50th percentile in weight, so the doctor was never worried. But we finally pushed the doctor, saying it just wasn't acceptable for him to be this bad, and she recommended Nutrimigen. Within a week, his spit-up reduced 75%. He was a MUCH happier baby all the time, and while he still got up at night, he didn't fight going back to sleep after eating like before. When we added rice cereal to thicken it up, his spitting up nearly stopped. He goes longer between feedings as well. To go from where we were to where we are now with my son is worth any cost. And this is the downfall, as Enfamil seems to be very well aware of this. Nutrimigen is very expensive, and most of the coupons that are available to be printed cannot be used to discount this. But if you have tried everything else and you find yourself in a similar situation, give this formula a try.

I stuck with the original reciepe until this last Christmas.  I added the chocolate rum cake and the pineapple rum cake as presents.  I didn't get to taste the pineapple cake but my mom and brother who got to taste both strongly agreed that the pineapple was super moist and had more of a rum flavor than the original and the chocolate cakes.  Needless to say, they have place their orders for this year's Christmas.

review/text: This is one of the flavors that our cat prefers.  Our cat, probably like yours, too, has very evident preferences in her food.  Ours likes Fancy Feast, but only the grilled-style in the seafood-type flavors.  Other brands and other flavors, even Fancy Feast, get ignored by our cat.<br /><br />The shipment of cat food (we bought about $75 worth) arrived quickly and well packaged, part of it in plastic-wrapped cardboard flats of 24 cans, and part of the shipment in 24 can boxes.  The cat food's freshness dates were well out into next year, and the cans were clean and in perfect, undamaged condition.<br /><br />The Amazon price is approximately the same as the price at our local big-box stores, but with Amazon's free shipping (and maybe no sales tax, depending on your state's tax laws), you can't beat the convenience of having cat food delivered directly to your door.

The quality is still there, just as it was when I was a kid, and my mom purchased it from the Watkins man when he made his monthly trips to the rural areas of Arkansas.<br /><br />I especially love the size of the bottles a full 8 ounces. Much larger than the traditional size that you find in the grocery stores. The flavor really does come thru in baked products. I also used the Watkins 8 oz. Orange Extract in the recipe  I made for  TRIPLE ORANGE BUTTER CAKE By Lady Rose. It was full of Orange and Butter flavors, and was so moist and tasty. Head over to Just a Pinch Recipe Club, and check out the ingredients I used and to view a picture of this recipe that I created. I am sure you will be just as impressed with the recipe using Watkins products as my neighbors & I was. It really adds lots of FLAVOR TO ANY RECIPE. A little of it goes a long way when it comes to stretching flavor.<br /><br />I AM JUST SO EXICITED THAT I CAN ORDER FROM AMAZON and get my merchandise in a few days.  I have also used their Peppermint Extract, also in 8 ounces. Watkins and Amazon are a GREAT TEAM TOGETHER, bringing quality ingredients that we know and love at exceptional prices. The Marianne cake pan that I used  to bake the TRIPLE ORANGE BUTTER CAKE by LADY ROSE, I also ordered from Amazon at a great price, but that is another review. Always make AMAZON your first stop when it comes to ONLINE SHOPPING, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG, & can't beat the value and price.

review/summary: A quick cookie that tastes like a pro made it
review/text: I am a trained baker and have made every kind of bakery product.  But, living in a climate with torrid summers, I am less inclined to spend a great deal of time in a hot kitchen so I look for shortcuts.  Krusteaz products are good quality and easy to use, cutting down prep time so you can bake during hot weather, without too much time sweltering.  I tweak all the Krusteaz mixes.  To this one I add a drop or two of butter pecan flavoring and the chocolate chips suggested on the box.  Make sure you line your baking pan and do not overbake these cookies, if you want them to be chewy.  Keep them in a tightly sealed container, separated with wax or deli paper. If you do not keep out the air, these cookies will stale more quickly than scratch cookies.  Otherwise, no one will know the difference.

review/summary: Great cookie mix; hard to find locally
review/text: This cookie mix had been in our local grocery store, then disappeared without notice (as many of our addictions are wont to do!)  We found it on Amazon and ordered it promptly.  It came in perfect condition, in a timely manner--and we were back with our cookie fix in no time.  Add chocolate chips as directed on the box and your friends will think you're super clever, and may even ask for the recipe!  There's no need to spill the beans about it being a mix (they don't need to know all your secrets)...Note: deception is not encouraged.

review/text: THESE ARE PROBABLY THE BEST SUGAR RUSH SNACKS. I LIKE TO EAT THIS SO THAT I GET JUICED UP WHEN I NEEDED IN CLASS. THIS KEEPS YOUR BRAIN IN FOCUS IN CLASS DURING THOSE EARLY 7AM MORNINGS IN HIGH SCHOOL. MOST STUDENTS PREFER GOING TO STARBUCKS AND GETTING A CUP OF JOE BUT THIS DOES THE SAME AT A FRACTION OF THE PRICE.

review/text: This frosting is great, especially if you want to use black but don't want it to taste bitter.  The only thing I don't understand is the price.  This frosting is $1.50 a tube at Wal-Mart.

review/summary: Does not dry overnight; thick gel hard to apply evenly
review/text: Wilton's Black Sparkle Gel icing looks and tastes good, but the thick gel is difficult to apply evenly.  I used it on sugar cookies to make "ladybug spots and antennae," which worked out fine, but the applicator and thickness of the icing made drawing fine lines (e.g., for piping ladybug "heads") very difficult.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is that this icing does not dry quickly (I left my cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight, at which point the icing was still wet.  After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.  I would not recommend this for decorating cookies; after 2 to 3 days for drying, your baked goods will have lost much of their freshness.

review/summary: Why make black icing at home?
review/text: I hate making black icing at home, there's always an after taste from the food coloring and it ends up being a big mess. The Wilton tubes of black icing are great for frozen buttercream transfers when I decorate a birthday cake and much easier to handle.

review/text: This product tastes nothing like butter and is a waste of money.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and he said he only sells the product and doesn't make it so I should contact the manufacturer.<br /><br />Nice way to run a business. They are totally protected and never will ever take on any responsibility.<br /><br />Beware.
