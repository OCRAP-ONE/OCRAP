review/summary: Messy arrival!
review/text: I was looking forward to receiving this item to experiment on vindaloo curry recipe I had.  It arrived on time, but when I opened the box, it was a fluorescent orange mess!  The jar was not sealed right, and the juice from the paste was all over the box.  Good thing I was not wearing white skirt.  It went straight to the trash, as it is not even worth making an effort to ship it back.<br /><br />I would think that commercial products like this should be sealed tight enough not only for leakage proofing, but also for sanitation/safety purposes.  Did I just happen to be unlucky?

Being so delicate, even though the package was packed carefully , several of the packages were damaged and the cookies broke when you took them out of the container.  We have eaten 4 packages of the 12 and 3 of those 4 had cracked cookies. BUT if you don't need them for a party for appearance the taste is exceptional-- in pieces or whole!!

review/text: I discovered these inexpensive gems on sale at my local supermarket.  Something like 4 packs for $2.<br />Wow, I'm glad I tried them.<br />They are like a slightly dry, and only slightly sweet, biscuit.  Really nice with a cup of tea, etc.<br /><br />Only 130 calories for 5 cookies, puts these into an inexpensive and reasonable calorie treat, that you could package into individual servings for lunches, etc.

review/summary: Krusteaz Crumb Cake/Muffin Mix Tastes Good, Requires Extra Steps in Preparation
review/text: Some assembly required!  KRUSTEAZ CINNAMON CRUMB CAKE & MUFFIN MIX tastes good, but requires more preparation steps than you expect from a cake or muffin mix.  If you're making crumb cake, you have to layer the cake mix and crumb topping, swirl the batter with a knife, and then sprinkle on a final layer of crumb topping.  If you're making muffins, you have to fold half the crumb topping into the cake mix, and then sprinkle the remaining crumb topping on top.<br /><br />My husband loved these.  I loved the cake part, but felt that the cinnamon/sugar/crumb topping was too sweet.  However, you can't really go wrong with Krusteaz mixes, particularly <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016BU7AK">Krusteaz Banana Nut Muffin Mix)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016BU7GO">Krusteaz Cranberry Orange Supreme Muffin Mix</a>.<br /><br />For a crumb cake or 12 standard muffins, you need one egg, 2/3 cup water, and one package of the mix.  My muffins took a couple more minutes than the package directions called for, when I used the convection oven setting on an electric range.  I purchased this particular Krusteaz cake/muffin mix at my local grocery store.

review/summary: Very good for a packaged mix
review/text: I'm basically lazy in the kitchen and look for ways to get in and out of there quickly.  I need to pack lunches so I thought this would make a nice treat and would pack easily.  The guys are impressed; they thought I baked these from scratch or bought them from a bakery.  When I said they are a boxed mix they were shocked and said keep on making them.  I made sure to not over-cook them so they would stay moist and tender. One thing I noticed is the edges got a wonderful crusty/chewy section where the cinnamon sugar caramelized - that is my favorite part.  It has a good amount of cinnamon flavor, sweet enough to have with coffee or as a dessert.  I made these in a 9x9 inch pan and cooked them a bit less than called for.  Excellent product and I'll continue to purchase Krusteaz Cinnamon Crumb Cake Mix again.

review/summary: Patches loves this stuff.
review/text: We adopted senior cat Patches a month ago & first day offered her 2 dishes of dry food, the food she was given at the foster home and this Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul senior hairball formula. She ignored the other food and emptied her dish of this one. To date she eats it with enthusiasm, but not so much so that we have to ration her daily intake. Vet says she seems to be doing very well on it and highly approves the assay. All her systems are working as they're supposed to. She will be kept on this food as long as it's available. I would recommend it to other owners of senior cats.

review/summary: Love the Oats, NOT the Pricing on Amazon.
review/text: I am so picky about oatmeal. I don't like sugar or fruit or any sort of add ins, other than the normal grains. This Raw oatmeal is the best I have tried without having to dedicate a lot of time to the process. I love the added flax and the quinoa was the kicker!You won't find a better quickie breakfast with tons of flavor than this. Since I don't get to shop often, I thought I would set up to have it delivered to me on a monthly basis.  Until I saw the pricing. I paid 1.79 at the local store. How or why the sellers on Amazon think we are all stupid enough to pay this over inflated pricing, even with shipping going up, is beyond me. I had someone take me to the store tonight and I purchased every package on the shelf. I will stop at another shop tomorrow. I hope everyone else does the same price check. Unless you are in Nome or the Falklands, check locally and save a ton of money. Then gloat over the yumminess of a bowl of this goodness knowing you saved money.

review/summary: Outstanding! Great taste, not mushy, flavorful!
review/text: I was back in MN visiting relatives and realized that there were not any whole grain items in the house. I like whole wheat, whole grain, no added sugar products. There were some of these Better Oats products but only the ones with added items in them. On a run to my favorite on site retailer (big bulls eye place) I found this and picked it up. Both my daughter and I loved it. We found it to have wonderful flavor, easy to prepare, a good serving size, and really liked the texture which was not mushy or runny. I have never liked instant oatmeal before in my life!<br /><br />If you want regular solid oatmeal but need to prepare it in a hurry you need to give this a try.

review/summary: THE BEST!
review/text: I bought this cereal at my local market a couple of months ago. I usually eat oatmeal or grits or some sort of hot cereal in the morning. I've never been a fan of instant cereals, so it's the old fashioned cook them in a pot ones that get my attention.<br /><br />This cereal is a mix of so many good-for-you grains. And what makes it so exceptional to me is not the only taste which is amazing, but the fact you just put it in a bowl and add water or milk (or both) and microwave it for 2 minutes. That's it.<br /><br />It is creamy (I mix a bit of milk in it) and I add nuts and raisins and sometimes dry cereal.  It is very thick and rich and very filling. I've now bought and used 6 boxes of this stuff! I have it every morning - it's so easy to make.<br /><br />Needless to say, highly recommended. I'm recommending this to everyone I know.

review/text: I wouldn't buy this from the same Amazon seller in the future, because it turns out that the cost is dramatically higher than at my local store.<br /><br />But as for the product itself, I'm thrilled. It's a fast, healthy breakfast that's great on a cold morning. It doesn't have a great deal of flavor by itself, so be prepared to doctor it a bit (I like cinammon and fruit or nuts). It takes just two minutes to cook in the microwave, and the pouch serves as a measuring cup for the water. After cooking, I like to splash just a bit of cream in it.<br /><br />The best thing about this is how it sticks with you. I find that when I have this for breakfast, I'm not hungry again until lunchtime--despite exercising each morning to crank up my metabolism.

The amazon price, $8.5 for 3 packages of 5, is way overpriced. Regular price for one package of 5 at Safeway is $2.5, with promotional price at $1.25 (I stocked up when they were in discount). (I leave in Bellevue, WA, near Seattle.) So unless the price was adjusted by the seller, I recommend that you check your local Safeway first.

review/summary: Doesn't taste as good as it sounds
review/text: I love white teas and have really enjoyed experimenting with different flavors through Teavana.  Youthberry, White Ayurvedic Chai and Spice of Life are a few of my favorites.  The description of ingredients for Frutto Bianco pearls seems heavenly: kiwi, coconut, and tropical fruit bits.  I read several customer reviews that equated their experience of drinking this tea to lying on a beach in Hawaii (which definitely enticed me!)  However, after thoroughly enjoying most other Teavana white teas, this one was a disappointment.  The aroma (one of my favorite things about these teas) was very mild and not altogether pleasant.  Once brewed, the flavor was just blah.  I only bought a few ounces of it, but it is still here 5 months later.  I am now mixing it up with my other teas just to use it up.  If you prefer a more mellow taste, this may be more appealing to you (and my 7 year old daughter does enjoy the aroma of this one).  Once nice thing about this tea are the "pearls," these white tea leaves are even more unprocessed than other forms and present as lovely round spheres which slowly unfurl once they are brewed.

The treat will keep falling out of his mouth while he tries to bite it into a smaller piece, and eventually he just gives up.  They really should be softer, flatter, or smaller.<br /><br />At least for my cat, these are very poorly designed, seeming more like shrunken-down dog treats.

review/summary: My Kitties Adore These!
review/text: I had bought these randomly at a pet store not realizing how much my two cats would love them. I rarely go to a pet store since all my food comes from the vet and the grocery store doesn't sell these. Thank you Amazon for making my life so much easier - couldn't do it without you! Treat your kitties, buy any of the flavors they will love you for it :)

review/text: We have four cats, and two of them could care less about these treats but the other two go nuts for them.  That's about par for the course, because as we know there are few things cats find unanimously palatable.  Our oldest is thin and unwell these days and these treats are the only thing he is enthusiastic about eating.  I have gotten him to  eat some wet food by placing these on top.  Worth a try if your cat feels the same way about them. Haven't tried the other flavors yet.

review/summary: a true novice point of view
review/text: At 42 years old I am *still* a total novice when it comes to wine; I buy maybe one or two bottles in a whole year but when I do, it's always Sutter Home White Zinfandel. My novice reasoning tells me that it must be good on some level because flying blind and not knowing a thing about what is *supposed* to make a good wine, I still happen to think this one is simply delicious.<br /><br />Not dry or acidic like white wines I've tried, this one is smoother, and a little bit fruity with what I'd say is a floral and very slight berry taste to it. I don't drink reds at all because to me they often will give me a headache. I don't know if this white zinfandel is supposed to go with meat, poultry, or fish but over the years I've had it at least once with all three. It seems to go well for me with pretty much anything, from a juicy burger to my herb crusted stuffed leg of lamb.<br /><br />It is very inexpensive locally, about four dollars for this 750ml size so there's not much of an investment or commitment to give it a try.

review/text: I purchsed two 6-pack boxes of this chili. It is great from the first time I tried it. I did not want chicken/meat so I left that out. I added more mixed dried vegetables instead. I used two bags since I love beans particularly in the winter.  I almost always find I have to alter spices adding various things, not this time. It truly tastes great. I really liked the variation of beans. It was very easy to make. The quality is excellant and I highly recommend it!

I've had so many requests for this chili that I recently purchased a large quantity to hand out to family and friends.  Do not let the name of the chili stop you from making it.

review/text: I adapted this for a crock pot and it was super easy and delicious.  Soften the beans first (soaking overnight is an easy way) then just throw all of the ingredients in a crock pot with 3 14-oz cans of chicken broth and about 2 lbs of chicken tenderloin (so you don't have to chop the meat). Cook overnight on low, and you're done!  The recipe calls for a can of green chili peppers but I left that out to make it mild enough for my kids to eat.  It was still very flavorful without it.

review/text: I like that this is organic, because corn is one of the most genetically modified products out there.  I use it to coat tofu to fry it so it makes it nice and crispy.  It's more expensive and I'll keep looking for a local source for it.  It is just like regular corn starch to use so you won't notice anything strange about it.  Box is about the same size as a standard box of corn starch.  There was a snafu with the shipping though.  I ordered two boxes, and they shipped the two boxes in two SEPARATE larger boxes, and charged my credit card for four boxes.  I got it worked out, but it was a bit of a hassle.  Honest mistake I'm sure, but yucky.

review/text: I have reordered this product before in 240 count. I was waiting for my appointment at Yale New Haven Hospital and viewing the hospital closed circuit TV which was explaining health tips. The topic changed to the benefits of green tea and it mentioned it's anti oxidant properties and the fact that it helps reduce belly fat!!. I do not have a real problem in this area as I am 5' 10 1/2" tall and weighed 209 lbs. After surgery I had to watch my diet and with the help of Stash Green Tea consumed cold from a 32 once thermos at least three times weekly I have lost 17 lbs and inches from my belly area. TIP; Cut the string and tab off four tea bags and place in a 32 oz. thermos, top off with filtered water. You can refill with water all day or add one or two additional tea bags while leaving the others in the thermos. Keep refrigerated if possible. Ice cubes will rupture the tea bags. Try this for three months for at least three days a week or more and see if the belly isn't flatter!!

review/text: I'm picky about my green teas. Sometimes they're too weak, sometimes it just doesn't smell/taste like green tea, or sometimes it's just horribly bitter/sour and unpalatable (think most grocery store teas).<br /><br />But Stash's green tea is TERRIFIC. There's a good element of leafyness (it IS green after all) without much bitter/sourness. I can usually pull at least 2 good cups of hot green tea from each tea bag.<br />I was actually previously disappointed by Yogi's Green tea (it's just purely green tea leaves, can't remember the exact name of it though) - when steeped in hot water it smelled like burnt tires, so I almost lost hope in American grocery store teas. I previously would only buy the Yamamotoyama green teas (slight roasted flavor) and Stash's green tea tastes remarkably similar, which makes me incredibly happy due to the Stash tea sales that have been going on at my local markets. WOO!!!

review/summary: Lemongrass and Mint
review/text: It should probably be called Lemongrass Mint to more accurately describe the taste.  It's especially good as ice tea, but drinking it hot is enjoyable too.  The mint taste is not as strong as the lemongrass.  I notice that some reviewers here say they barely taste the lemongrass, while others think it overwhelms the mint.  It's a good idea to buy a box of this tea to try it out before ordering 6 boxes.  I usually drink Bigelow Plantation Mint black tea, so I'm accustomed to a strong mint flavor.  Lucky for me that I like lemongrass too, so the balance of lemongrass and mint was not a problem for me.

review/summary: Unpleasant Grassy Taste
review/text: I realize that taste in tea, and particularly green tea is a matter of personal preference. For me, I found this tea to be unpleasant. Opening the tea bag, I detected an aroma reminiscent of lawn clippings. As I drank the tea, I find the unpleasant aroma becomes an unpleasant taste. I am not sure how to describe it . . . perhaps wet lawn clippings or even a mossy taste. I do not get the sharp "bite" I normally expect from a good green tea.<br /><br />I will try this for a week, and see if I am missing something, but as for now, I can not recommend purchasing this tea.

It tastes great and is smooth and in my opinion this tea is very good quality it has a slightly sweet flavor which I find very pleasing and it comes with 120 tea bags.. I'm really glad that I bought the Stash green tea brand.  I highly recommend it.  Also, I have to give amazon props because they did great on their shipping, very fast.

review/summary: Great Tea, don't buy online
review/text: I far prefer this brand of green tea over Lipton and some others I've found available at the grocery store. Good quality tea, good flavor. However, the price they are offering you to buy in bulk online is higher than buying 6 single boxes at the store. I've found this tea is always between $2 and $2.50 per box of 20. Multiply $2.50 by 6 and you get $15.00. They are asking $16.50 before shipping for the same amount. I think I'll keep buying it at the store.

review/text: Stash Moroccan mint is my favorite, but this makes a nice change.  IT's got the same mellow mint as the Moroccan mint, but it's also got lime flavor.  It's not like drinking a mojito- but with a fresh slice of lime and some sugar, it's pretty darned good.  I drink it how, but the other reviewer suggested it over ice.  That would be great, I'm sure- I just happen to like my tea hot.

The mint isn't harsh- which is what I like about moroccan mint.  And if you add lemon to it (and I add a little German rock sugar) it's just amazingly good.  The new Mojito mint by Stash is also great.  I don't like it quite as much as this one, but I drink a ton of tea, and have about 5 favorites- and this and the Mojito are definitely two of the 5 (I also love the Stash organic Chai)

review/summary: ITS ALL NATURAL AND IT TASTE LIKE IT....VERY HEALTHY THOUGH..
review/text: So this is the first green tea ive bought and the second ive tasted. The first one i tasted was alittle better tasting. This stash green tea however does taste lets say, 'natural'. what i mean by that is it taste exactly like what it is, all natural dried herbs. It does look like leafs though not just crushed up almost powdery stuff like the other bag i drank. Im not quite sure what green tea is supposed to taste like but this one is NOT good but its NOT that bad either and its also NOT sweet at all. But hey i am drinking green tea for its health benefits not for its flavor. Overall though i DO recommend this green tea just like the name says it does appear to be premium green tea judging by how it looks and the 'natural' taste, so if your just after those health benefits you wont be disappointed if you want good taste this probably wont make you happy.

review/text: I have tried many types of tea - from "the scoop your own, tea-shoppe, imports" to the "waiter swears this is the greatest one ever" - and never did I expect to find my favorite, bar none, in this simple unassuming little box. I drink this every single day at work, often using 4-5 packs a day. Fair warning: this 6-pack may not be that great of a deal, depending on where you live. I can get it at the supermarket for about $2.48 a box. To have this 6-pack work out to be a better bargain than buying local it would have to be 14 bucks per, or less. BUT, that has nothing to do with the quality of this product. The tea itself is great.

review/text: Some mint teas are overwhelming but Stash's Morocan Mint is just mildly minty. It is made with spearmint, lemongrass, peppermint and green tea. I don't really taste anything too lemony. This has a smooth, refreshing taste that you can enjoy every day or when you are tired of tea with milk. I like this tea with one packet of stevia. It would also be great with honey. If you don't think this is strong enough use two tea bags like I do.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Green tea can be very bitter especially if you brew it too long. This tea brews quickly and has a very pure taste and delicate aroma. I like drinking each cup with a packet of stevia. It seems to sweeten it just enough without masking the subtle silky flavors. This tea is made of rare white tea and green tea. White tea actually has more antioxidants than green tea and has less caffeine. So this particluar tea is very healthy. However you will probably drink it often because it tastes so good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: No Bitter Taste like Other Green Teas
review/text: My first impression of Stash's green chai tea is that it isn't bitter like other green teas. The spices are also mild. This tea contains green tea, cinnamon, ginger root, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil. I normally would not add milk to a green tea but adding two tablespoons of nonfat milk powder and a packet of stevia makes this tea perfectly soothing. If you don't like tea overly spicy this will appeal to you. I think it tastes better than a lot of chai teas made with black tea leaves.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

The box it came in said "Stash" on the side. I'm assuming this tea came directly from the company. I should think it did by how cheap it is! At the grocery stores near me this tea is $3 a box on sell. This is a great deal!<br /><br />Stash is by far the best company for jasmine tea. I love this stuff! The only thing I would say to a new customer is don't reuse tea bags. Other than that, enjoy! It doesn't get better than this!

review/text: I would, by no means, consider myself a green tea expert, but, I definitely appreciate its place in my life, and as part of my morning breakfast ritual. I find that I feel the antioxidants percolate in my head. What's more, I actually am one of those weird people who like how bitter it tastes, when you've brewed it to its full potential. Stash Premium Green Tea does not fail to disappoint, in the antioxidant factor. What's more, there is a wonderful smoky quality, too. Stash has always produced a high quality line of teas, and this is another wonderful addition to their family of flavors and adventures in hot water......

review/text: I was recently turned on to the health benefits of white tea, so I decided to try it out. Apparently, white tea doesn't have much flavor on it's own, which are why there are so many flavored whites. As a daily green tea drinker, I immediately thought this would be a good combo for me when I saw it. Stash is a very high-quality brand and you can tell by the taste of the tea. It has kind of a fresh, grassy (in a good way!) taste that is really distinct of high-quality teas. And now I can get the benefit of both green & white in the same cup. Yeah!

review/summary: On second thought...
review/text: One thing you'll notice from having this tea, right off the bat is the larger size of the tea leaves, and how much tea is in the bag itself. I went back to the market and have since bought 3 more boxes of tea from different brands, and quality and size are easily noticeable; Stash PGT's leaves actually look like leaves, and not burnt up, shriveled sawdust. They leaves also have a pretty color, and aren't oxidized.<br /><br />Since I grew up on sugar laden drinks, drinking both teas without sugar was rough, but now that I'm used to it, these teas are just super tasty and don't even need a grain of sugar. I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun. I "brew" my tea from anywhere between 15 min to 30 min.<br /><br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br /><br />Stash is a great starter tea if you've never seriously drunk tea before. After tasting around a bit, this tea is not really as good as I thought it was...Taste around, it's the only way you'll know if somethings really good or not~

But here, the mint is not overpowering (as other reviewers say) but it has been given a good balance. I add half a tsp of Natural 'Sugar in the Raw' (it has only 2g of sugar) to give a lil' more sweetness to this tea, and its OUTSTANDING!!!!! Highly recommended. I am going to order the 6-pack version from Amazon soon after my current box empties itself.

review/text: The fragrance is strong and floral - lovely.  The tea is dark golden brown  and much more like a fermented Oolong than green tea.  I didn't like it at first, because it lacks the gentle subtlety of the blend of green and jasmine.  It's almost like an afternoon tea with jasmine added.  Over time, this tea has grown on me, and I like that it is a bit stronger than a typical jasmine green.  However, when I want that delicate flavored, I look for something else, even the Bigelow (and I'm not a great Bigelow fan).
