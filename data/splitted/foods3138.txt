review/summary: Too Sweet
review/text: I've had other Kind bars and this one is okay (I don't particularly care for the taste). In my opinion, it's too sweet (while I occasionally indulge in sweet things, this isn't what I had expected with this product). Every bar is 40g and there are 13g of sugar. Yikes. I wish I had looked this up before I purchased this because I have nine more bars. What's worse, instead of getting twelve bars, my box only came with ten. I will not be ordering this or any other Kind bars.

Only 1.4oz<br />* Contains "soy crisps"<br /><br />Other:<br />* No gluten, wheat, or dairy<br />* Bar says "Made in Australia"

review/summary: BEST ALL AROUND NUTRITION BAR FOR A MEAL OR SNACK
review/text: I have tried numerous bars, but the KIND PLUS Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants is the best all around. It is visually & aromatically appealing and the crunchy fruit and nut taste is truly sensational. I have one every morning with a 4oz. probiotic yogurt and my coffee. It is very satisfying on many levels as well as healthy for me. Kind told me that the price I paid for these on Amazon is excellent since they typically retail at $2. per bar in stores. These are so incredible that I possibly could go into 'withdrawal' without my daily Kind fix!

review/summary: Mango Macadamia bars are gross
review/text: I normally like Kind bars, but the mango flavored ones are way too sweet. I don't even know how to describe the overpowering flavor. It tastes like the bars were sprayed with perfume and then dipped in tropical syrup. They could have made the mango flavoring a little more subtle.

review/summary: Definitely not for me...
review/text: I have enjoyed the KIND bars, but these Almond Cashew ones are definitely not for me.  Much more dense and gooey that the other varieties that I have had, they did have a good crunch.  However, even the crunch felt slightly mushy at times.  With no real flavor to make up for the texture, I would not buy these again.

review/text: I have tried many snack and nutritional bars, and these are my current favorite. The combination of flavors not only satisfies my hunger but also satisfies my desire for something sweet. What turns me off about most fruit/nut bars is the syrupy sweet substance that holds the ingredients together. I don't taste that at all in any of the Kind bars. I have this particular variety on auto delivery.

review/summary: Delicious and satisfying all-purpose bar
review/text: Almost every breakfast/snack bar is plastered with claims that it's "satisfying" and "nutritious."  Ironically, the exact opposite is usually the case:  the bar amounts to a couple of bites of chemical-laden chalk comprised of over-processed protein isolate and corn syrup.  These KIND bars are one of the only available bars on the market that actually ARE delicious, nutritious, and filling.<br /><br />I'm a chocolate and peanut butter fiend, and before I discovered KIND bars, I had abandoned my years-long quest for a bar that contained chocolate and peanut butter without being a glorified candy bar devoid of nutritive value.  I have one almost every day for breakfast, and for hours afterward I feel both satisfied and energetic, in contrast to the jittery 30-minute sugar rush followed by a swift crash provided by other brands.

I'm not into candy and am trying to eat clean (Paleo), so thought this would be a nice snack idea for when I'm on the go, etc. Well, what bothers me is that it has glucose (the bar is very sweet) and soy. Otherwise, I think it's my favorite snack bar so far.

review/summary: Nice snack that lasts!
review/text: This bar has cranberries, almonds, and macadamia nuts (NOT bits and pieces!) as their main ingredients, in a soft honey-like glaze to keep it all together.  I refrigerate them in the summer or they kind of "wilt".  The ingredients are fresh, and the nuts are crunchy.  What I really appreciate about these bars is that it really takes time to eat and enjoy them.  Those nuts are meant to be chewed and not inhaled, unlike a lot of snacks that disappear as soon as you get the wrapper off.  I can't eat one in front of my favorite dog, as this is one snack I am too fond of to share with her... much to her dismay.  I think they are worth the cost, and I know they cost way more if you find them in a local grocery store.

review/summary: the Peanut bar
review/text: I was looking forward to receiving this order. Almonds, macadamias, and walnuts! Sounded delicious.<br />Then I tried one, and was puzzled. Yes, I could taste some almond, but WOW, the  main flavor was PEANUTS. The ingredients list peanuts as the largest amount of nuts. This should be called the Peanut, Almond Bar. If one likes to have the main flavor of a nut bar as peanuts, you will enjoy this.<br />The quality of KIND products I appreciate, as well as the low GI, the natural properties, and having a healthier choice. But honesty in advertising and product would be appreciated.<br /><br />I was disappointed with the deception, and the unexpectedly strong flavor of peanuts, as I purchased it for the nuts I like best, which were supposed to be the main source of nut protein.<br />Let's get honest KIND!

review/text: These were a staple for my gluten-free teenager until a few months ago when she started complaining that they tasted different, not in a good way.  We found out that the company has moved to a new factory/producer and that the formula has changed in some ways.  The flavor is not as fresh and tastes more like processed food. We are really disappointed and are hoping that the company can somehow find its way back to making really great bars.

review/summary: Delicious and nutricious!
review/text: I like protein bars conceptually - something to grab as you rush out - I go to a lot of 6 pm meetings,  and plan to eat dinner when they end,  but by then I'm ravenous,  and I need something to hold me through them.  So I've tried a lot of bars and frankly they range around mediocre,  pretending to be something (chocolate!)that they are clearly not.<br /><br />So what are these bars like?  Great!  Really delicious - full of nuts you can see and taste,  not too sweet,  as often these bars are, and it has protein!  A happy find,  we bought a box and will buy more,  I can see it becoming a staple in our cupboards.<br /><br />May 2010 - on to my third order,  so this is a really great snack in our house.  The protein really does help fill you up,  it's a perfect snack,  and all of us think it's delicious (though my son does prefer the macadamia passionfruit, this one has protein and that makes it a much better bar for me and my husband and our low sugar tendencies)

review/summary: Fabulous option for on-the-go snacks for those who eat Gluten Free!
review/text: I used to regularly grab various brands of granola and meal replacement bars when I was too busy to eat a proper meal, but since becoming gluten intolerant I have found myself at a loss for what to purchase.  Even seemingly innocent products would have hidden ingredients waiting to make me feel miserable.  Anyone who is gluten intolerant (or is allergic, or has Celiac) knows how frustrating it can be to find convenient foods, despite the growing number of food producers who are aware and clearly mark their packaging as "gluten free".<br /><br />Then, thanks to the bride at a recent wedding I photographed, I found Kind bars.  The almond-cranberry ones were the type she offered me as a snack while the bridesmaids were getting ready, and I found them to be a fabulous mix of flavors and have a very palatable texture (perhaps a bit on the dry side, but it's a nut bar, so have something to drink handy).  The amount of fiber and protein in these bars is quite filling even with the small portion size, and there are no worries about sugar drops thanks to the low-glycemic recipe.<br /><br />I highly recommend these to not just those who are gluten intolerant, but also for anyone who wants a healthy on-the-go snack that will actually sustain you until your next meal.  So far I haven't been disappointing by any flavors I've tried and just ordered a few I haven't seen anywhere in stores and look forward to reviewing those as well.

review/text: The only problem with this bar is that once you try it you can't seem to do without it, it tastes that good.<br />Dr. OZ mentioned these bars on his show so we thought we would try one, WOW! we love them.<br />This particular one, (KIND PLUS Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew) if you read the ingredients you will find not one thing that is bad for you. Finally a treat that won't harm you......unless you eat about six a day...(calories)<br />We checked quite a few places that handle this product and Amazon is by far the best price.

They're delicious and healthy.<br /><br />Kind Bars come in seveal flavors, but the Cranberry Almond is the only one with low glycemic index.  That's very important!  I don't feel guilty at all when I eat one.  Yummy and healthy.  What could be better.  And they're gluten free.

review/text: Tastes great and satisfies my hunger. I am currently on a fitness diet and I don't feel guilty when I am eating one of these.  Since there are no "melty" ingredients, it stays in tact in hot cars, at beaches etc which is an added bonus.  I took a star off because the calorie count is a bit high, but I chalk that up to the great taste and the fact that it fills you up.

I was not to fond of the super nutty one - but to each their own)<br />These in particular have an addictive quality which hurts my bank account.<br />you shouldn't be eating more than one of them in a day though, so it's honestly not that bad of a deal.<br />They just taste so darn good.

review/text: I've ordered a number of different kinds of "Kind" bars and "Kind Plus" bars before.<br /><br />These Cranberry Almond + Antioxidents Kind Plus bars are, by far, the most sticky I have ever had!  The wrapping sticks to the product, the product sticks to your fingers, and pretty soon, you're a bit messy.  You really need a wet-wipe for this product.<br /><br />The product itself is quite delicious, however, so just know that while it's yummy and crunchy and chewy, you'd do yourself a favor by knowing about the stickiness ahead of time.  Oh, and don't get it in your hair or in your child's hair by accident!

My mom is a type 1 diabetic and she found these and now she can't keep her hands off of them. She said she doesn't feel hungry as quick. Now my husband has found them. Geez! I have had one package that was a little more gooey but most of the time they are drier tasting. Personally I don't want it to be gooey. I am on a subscription of these through Amazon and I need to increase the amount. My kids haven't tried them...I am sure they are next except they are picky eaters.

review/summary: Get Your Fiber the Pleasant Way
review/text: I knew nothing about Kind Bars, until I saw them on QVC. Since I must be on a high fiber diet due to a colon problem, I tried them. After the first box, I was "hooked". These are the best tasting fiber bars I've ever had. The ones in the markets are good, but Kind Bars are the best. I use them as a once a day snack or desert. If I use it as a snack, I follow with 8 oz., water. I feel as satisfied as if I had a full meal. My favorite is almonds and cranberry. They are not too sweet, but just right for my taste. Another thing that I like about them is, they are moist and the nuts are easy to chew, not hard. If you like nuts, cranberries and honey, you'll love Kind Bars. MAK

review/text: These bars taste good and have all the right things in them (like almonds and cranberries, etc) that let you know they are doing your body good.  These bars were better tasting than other snacks I have eaten.  They are packed with good stuff that help keep your blood sugar balanced (I am hypoglycemic with fibromyalgia and a few other mechanical issues) and your energy stays up there.  This may have me making it a major part of my daily regime. These bars keep actually full me up for a while too.  They come in a smaller size which I am going to get just to stick in my purse for those sugar drops that leave you shaking and dizzy!! and of course for fighting those hunger pangs between meals.

review/summary: Kind Bars are the Best!
review/text: This box of Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio & Antioxidants is delicious as is all the Kind Bar products.  They are a great choice for a balanced, satisfying, nutritious bar very low in sodium and without gluten.  LOVE KIND bars.  I will definitely be back for more.  The 12 Pack boxes from Amazon are a GREAT VALUE too!

review/summary: These things are the best in between snack
review/text: Okay I was given one of these at a hotel during a conference. I love these things. I can't wait to try the other flavors. They are a great snack to have in between meals. My kids think they are candy so now I have to hide them.

review/summary: Really Good and Gluten Free
review/text: Kind Bars come in many flavors but this is my favorite. It allows you to have something made from healthy and organic ingredients that still seems like having a candy bar-just healthy. Received my last shipment and my bars were stale/hard as a rock. Never had this happen before.

review/summary: Great for breakfast or a snack
review/text: These bars are perfect to grab and go in the morning or for an afternoon addition to lunch.  Crunchy with a hint of sweetness from the cranberries.  I haven't tried the other flavors but intend to give them a shot as they are a low carb option for a bar.

review/summary: good taste and better than a snickers bar for you
review/text: There bars are pretty tasty.  But you are never going to find something that is nutritious and tastes better than a candy and chemical bar.  Anyway you look at this it is not a competitor to mainstream snack food.  I enjoy these bars and think that they taste good and are an enjoyable treat.

review/summary: Super Awesome!
review/text: This is by far the best purchase I can imagine to have made.<br />I bought these KIND bars and keep them in my office drawer.<br />They are yummy, nutritious and filling.<br />I find it to be the best choice instead of running down to the cafe for a Bagel or some other form of breakfast.<br />Also a very good option when you are totally deprived of energy and saturated.<br />It is not too sweet. Just the right flavor and amazing if you like dates and almonds (I love them).<br />Sometimes I feel I could eat many but then it fills you up just right to not crave for too many.<br />I love this particular flavor and also the cranberry one they have.<br />It seems like a total value for money item and they also were prompt at shipping it.

review/summary: REALLY Tasty and Chewy... though a bit small
review/text: These bars are delicious. Nuts and berries kind of stuck together with a thin layer of sweet, honey-like glaze. My only complaint is that they are not particularly filling - after I eat one I want to reach for another one.

review/text: I love these bars. They are a great snack to have around! They are a bit expensive but it's worth it for me. I usually buy them once a week and they tend to last a while. The minis are also a great choice if you are unsure of what flavor you'd like.

review/text: I love the taste and consistency of this bar. And the added calcium is a plus. But I try not to eat it too often because it has 12 grams of fat and the saturated fat is 25% of daily value. And 2g of protein is a bummer.

review/summary: Really nutty, but melts to the packaging
review/text: I'm excited to try the other KIND bars. I am looking for a low carb and more natural snack bars and I think KIND is a very good choice for that. The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is pretty good, although I haven't found a great number of cashews. I've had it in rather hot places and it does kind of lose its shape. That's annoying. Purchasing it through amazon.com was a breeze, I enjoyed having 12 at once and saving. This stuff is okay to buy in bulk because you can consume it so quickly.

review/summary: Cranberry & Almond - Tasty, natural and nutritional
review/text: At 190 calories, these bars provide a great calorie boost with very healthy ingredients.  Cranberries and almonds have loads of healthy benefits and naturally combining them into a convenient bar is definitely a one of a KIND product.  I am very satisfied with the taste and they are my friends' favorite choice when grabbing a snack to go from the pantry.  They have a short ingredient list compared to similar bars.  Purchasing through subscribe and save makes the amazon price the lowest I could find and very reasonable per bar.

review/summary: Good snack
review/text: I like this bar.  It does have an initial interesting taste, but I'm sure it's the mac nuts in it.  I would buy it again.  It is VERY moist and sticky - which is good cause it won't dry out your mouth like a lot of bars do.  I think I'd like to try other flavors as well.  I let a co-worker try it and she said, "it tastes like lip gloss".  I'm not sure how she got that opinion, but thought I'd put that in my review.  It is different from any other bar that I've eaten; sesame seeds, mac nuts, etc.
