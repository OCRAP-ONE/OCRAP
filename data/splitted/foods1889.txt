review/summary: Dog Not a Big Fan, but the Cats Loved It
review/text: My 10 year old doxi-mix, Onyx, has eaten wet food for most of her life, with dry food used more in the nature of a treat (a few pieces of kibble as a reward). I was hoping that she would take to the Beneful and mixed a little in with her canned food, and also used some pieces later as a treat. While she did eat some of the Beneful, for the most part she pushed it aside with her nose, and showed little interest later in the kibble as a treat. On the other hand, one of my cats ate what the dog left and was looking for more! I suspect that the fact that my dog has never shown much interest in dry food in general accounts for her lack of interest in Beneful, and is not a reflection on the quality of the product. I like the fact that the bag in which it is packaged has a sliding plastic closure, which I think will keep the contents fresher longer than a pull-apart closure. Perhaps dogs who eat dry food on a regular basis will be more interested in the product.

review/summary: Huskies eat it, don't ask for it by name
review/text: Beneful is good dry dog food as far as dry dog foods go. It's a brand that we buy whenever it happens to be on sale and our dogs don't mind it.<br /><br />Let's face reality, shall we? The LAST thing a dog would eat is 'dog food'. Dogs' favorite food is 'human food', then whatever they can catch if they happen to be outdoor dogs: bird, field mouse, rabbit (raw), the occasional raccoon. Our huskies are outdoor dogs. They do accept dog food whenever none of the above is available and they seem to be as tolerant of the Beneful as they are of most other brands. I am unaware of any dog food recipe, and we've fed them a couple dozen different ones, that they are looking forward to eating rather than eat them because they're hungry.<br /><br />There is a long list of ingredients that make up the Beneful mix and it's not unlike most other dry dog foods. It contains all kinds of veggies - huskies are quite wolf-like and I suspect veggies are a no-no for their wolf cousins - but they don't mind. I wish I could say that, thanks to the magic Beneful recipe our dogs are happy, strong and healthy. They are so but they are probably so because they live outdoors which is where wolf-like dogs love to live and possibly because their diet is varied. They eat Beneful every now and then and they're alright with it but I don't remember one instance where they asked for Beneful by name.

review/summary: Pricey but really, really good.
review/text: I have to admit it's very difficult to review dog food because you have to gauge your pet's excitement level about the product. Our dog Miley would get excited if I opened a bag of cement and poured it into her bowl! It's when she becomes excited again after eating Benefiful that I knew this was a good product. I mean, sure it's great for her health, and sure it's made with great nutritional items, but will she eat it? You betcha. As she happily eats this, I am kind of jealous, where's the Beneful people food!!!???<br /><br />I only lowered it a star because of the price, which I found a little steep under this economy. But, if you want quality, there is a price you'll have to pay. Your dog will thank you, with pleneful beneful face kisses.

review/summary: Less stomach upset than the Healthy Weight version
review/text: We have 3 large dogs, 2 being pure bred hunting labs (one rescued from a shelter) and the 3rd a mixed breed (also rescued from a shelter). The largest of our 3 dogs (7 years old and about 70lbs) has an ultra sensitive stomach. When we first got him as a young dog, we tried giving him different vet recommended dog foods, but after months of non-stop gas and runny doggy doo, it was the original Beneful formula that we found he seemed to do best with. Our smallest/oldest/mix-breed dog (11 years old and about 25lbs) does well on any dog food he's given, and so has never had any troubles eating Beneful either. Our youngest dog (about 50lbs and 3 years old) does get some minor gas from time to time with every dog food we have ever given to her, including Beneful. While the other two dogs are both slim and muscular, she's quite pudgy (for a lab) even with all the exercise she constantly gets. At one point we decided to move her to the Beneful Healthy Weight version of this dog food to see if it would help her lose a few pounds. We kept her on it for about 2 months, and while she did lose a little weight, she had non-stop terrible has and upset stomachs. So much so that she went from a very happy cheerful dog to one that seemed miserable and uncomfortable all the time. Within a few days of switching her back to this Beneful Original formula, she was her happy, playful, active self again. It's not the best quality, most expensive dog food on the market, but it's affordable, my dogs enjoy the taste and it doesn't make them sick or uncomfortable like some other brands/versions do.

They are small (shitzus) but they had no problems scarrfing this down.It looks pretty good as dogfood goes. It is different shapes and colors and contains chicken by products and beef.All in all it looks fine to me. My dogs eat a mix of canned ,dry, fresh vegetables and real meat.I 'm not too worried about their nutrition.I'd say  give it a try.

review/summary: Dog likes it
review/text: My dog has been eating this stuff for about eight years.  The dog likes it and the the dog is healthy, so I figure the food must be okay.  The only problem I have with this brand of food is the "Healty Weight" formula.  When our dog was a bit over-weight, I bought that and the dog just went wacky until I gave it more to eat.  It seemed like the Healthy Weight formula was just puffed up regular stuff.  So I just cut back on the regular stuff instead and the dog was fine.  So other than the Healthy Weight formula of this brand of dog food, I have no problem with it.

review/summary: More sugar and salt than peas and carrots
review/text: With a soft and hard combination of varied shapes and colors (colors for dogs?), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a> is an average priced dog food manufactured by a large established company that has finally created a good resealable package for for average dog kibble.  For this, I increase this review from an average of three stars to a four.  The dog isn't crazy about this food, but rather than waste such a large bag, we're sneaking small amounts into the food she regularly eats.  For dog owners who aren't familiar with the recommendations of most vets, don't change the food you give a dog suddenly, but mix it with the food they usually eat until it's well-tolerated.  We've not made it to full exchange with this one, but a previous dog of ours years ago liked this food when it was first introduced.  I'd recommend purchasing the food in a smaller amount to be sure your dog likes/tolerates this one.

review/summary: Better than "Dog Chow" but not by much
review/text: I work at a vet clinic so I hear daily conversations about the positives of a healthy meal for your pets.  For Dogs you want a high protein, low fat diet.  Now granted there are always tales of the dog that lived off of supermarket brand food that lived to be 20, but more often than not I find that the people who spend a little more to get a higher quality food spend much less in the veterinary office.<br /><br />When the bag arrived my dog was thrilled to death because he knew it was obviously for him.  With the primary ingredient being a corn meal I was not a happy mommy.  I also looked and a true meat product was not to be found in the first 3 ingredients on the bag (a sure sign of junk food).  I let him eat the kibble any way, which is full of various shapes and colors (please, dogs don't care about the color of their food - don't put fake coloring in my doggie's dinner).  It also had a strong odor to it that I didn't care for.  The odor enticed my doggie right in but after a few days he seemed completely disinterested in the food.<br /><br />Although I don't like the food, and after the novelty wore off neither did my dog - I did like the bag which contained a FUNCTIONAL zip to close in order to keep the food fresh. Congrats on the great bag, now please work on a better healthier formula for the kibble contained within.

review/summary: I Am Now Wondering!
review/text: We have been feeding this product to our two Miniature Schnauzers for quite some time, they are picky about what they eat; Beniful has been on their approved list for some time, they do like it.  However after reading a few of the reviews on this product I felt compelled to pick up the bag and read the ingredients.  I'm not too impressed----animal digest, what is that?, sugar---hmmm, food color, loads of corn meal etc. and then the preservatives which I do understand.  I'm sure it has become a science of manufacturing to create a product that most dogs will like at the cheapest cost to make.  Our dogs have always done well at their annual physicals, so I know there is adequate nourishment in the product, however, I now think there are better and more healthful products available, probably at a premium price, ingredients that would include a higher percentage of meat and poultry and less corn and grain.<br /><br />Do the dogs like this?  Yes<br />Could Nestle improve the ingredients?  Yes<br />Would I purchase again?  Not Sure<br />Is this a bad product?  I don't think so, could just be better.<br />Is there a better product at this price point?  I would really like to know!<br /><br />Just a thought:  Kids like candy, doesn't mean it's good for them!

review/summary: Dogs Love It But Is It beneficial?
review/text: My brother and I have an ongoing dispute about what is best to feed dogs.  I maintain, quality in will result in fewer illnesses and vet bills. My dogs usually eat Innova or Fromm.I rarely go to the vet for anything other than wellnes visits and shots. He thinks that the cheapest is fine. His dogs always have ear infections and are a bit on the pudgy side.<br /><br />Enter Beneful.  My brother thinks it is a high quality food brimming with meat and vegetables.  I was not so sure.  If you look at the bag, it would seem he was right but the ingredient list tells another story.  The primary ingredients are ground yellow corn, chicken by product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour and beef tallow.  Yes there is some real beef and much further down the list are carrots and peas. Not exactly the appetizing mix pictured on the bag.<br /><br />The kibble itself has a pleasing appearance.  With no discernible odor, it comes in a variety of shapes colors and textures.  The dogs love it, which is probably not a resounding endorsement as one of them will reguarly clean the cats litterbox if you are not careful.  But in fairness, they do gobble it with great enthusiasm and even try to open the bag to get seconds.<br /><br />The bag is one of the best things about this food.  It has a plastic slide zip which not only works smoothly but keeps the food fresh and safe from maruading pooches.  It is bright and colorful and the 15.5 pound size  is easy to handle.<br /><br />I guess in someways it is like letting your kids go to McDonald's.  An occasional meal won't kill them, but it is not good for everyday.  I will go back to my expensive premiums and use the remaining kibble as training bits.  My brother however, thinks it is great because all the dogs dive into it with unbridled enthusiasm and it is significantly less expensive.  For what it is worth I have a one year old Geraman shepherd and two 3 year old Chinese Cresteds.  He has a 6 year old shepherd, an 18 yr old schnoodle and a three year old chow mix.<br /><br />If you are concerned with convenience the packaging makes this product ideal.  However if you are seeking a high quality food for your pet, I would look elsewhere.

review/summary: My picky eater picked at it
review/text: My gulp-and-go boys thought it was great, but they think that about anything that's not moving much.  The littlest one will even eat celery, so you can't take their taste as a guide.  (Plus, his stomach is too tiny for big dog food, and I saw it again, in the wrong direction.)<br /><br />I rather wonder about all the color--that's for me, not for my dogs.  Ditto the shapes.  Supposed to make me think each little bit of not-crunchy kibble is nutritionally different?  Zip lock packaging maintains freshness, I suppose, and is, in this dog family, a PITA to use.<br /><br />My life takes me to the feed store often enough that delivery doesn't offer any real benefits.<br /><br />My picky eater will go back to getting a spoon of canned food on the kibble when we don't have table scrap to enhance her dogfood, and the chow hounds won't miss the fancy colors and shapes one bit.

review/summary: I can't rate taste, but my dogs love it.
review/text: I have four dogs ranging from a 7 pound Chihuahua, a 30 pound Chinese Crested, and 2 mixed dogs (15 and 25 pounds).  Three of them are rescue dogs and for some time now I have been feeding them what the Rescue was feeding them, Taste of the Wild by Diamond.  I was paying over $45 for a large bag of dog food that recently had the largest recall by Diamond.  My dogs are my babies and I have never had a scare like this before.  I never knew Diamond brands was known for recalling their pet foods.  After researching the internet for brands of pet foods that have never had a recall, I was shocked and impressed to see that Purina DOG food was the only one that never has.  They have had recalls on cat foods but never on dog food.  At least from the articles I found online. If you don't believe Google "brands of dog food that has never had a recall", Purina will be listed first.<br /><br />What I found interesting is that to me all dog foods smell "disgusting".  It might look appetizing with the different shapes and sizes and pretty colors but I always wondered how they can eat the stuff.  When I fed my pooches the Taste of The Wild, they always left food behind in their dishes.  Since feeding the Purina Beneful all four dishes are left empty.  I know Purina is considered the more "middle" brand of animal food, but it has been around for years and most important my dogs love it.  I will continue to feed them the Purina Beneful and give them daily vitamins and healthy treats to make sure they meet their daily recommended nutrition.  There are several varieties to pick from and plan on mixing things up for a little excitement!

review/summary: How to review dog food
review/text: While I love dogs and want them to have good lives, I still balk at the idea of actually TASTING their food.  That makes it tough to review dog food.  I'm not a nutrition expert...all I can do is comment on my personal experience.<br /><br />First of all, Beneful dog food smells better than MANY popular dog foods.  That is a BIG plus in my book.  If smell is a decent indicator of how appetizing something might be to eat, then I would say Beneful must taste pretty good to the dog.  Any the dog loves it (as much as any dog who occasionally gets human food scraps can "love" dog food).  He always sniffs it with interest when presented, and eats it with gusto when he's ready to eat.  When he decides its time to dig in, he'll polish off his bowl.  That's a pretty good indicator to me.  I think Beneful is a good compromise between your standard "Dog Chow" and the much more expensive items you see in speciality pet stores.  It is just a little more expensive than the "common" stuff, but if you can't afford the price of the top tier food...I think Beneful makes a great alternative for something a bit more flavorful and which (based on information provided, not any "scientific research" on my part) has a bit more concern for providing your pooch with a well balanced diet.<br /><br />I think if you've not tried it, it is WELL worth seeing what your dog things.

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:53 Mins<br /><br /></span>The 15.5 pound of Beneful Original Dog food arrived late this afternoon. My 125 pound mastiff has not eaten since last night. He should be hungry. I put a bowl of this food down in front of him and he sniffed it, took one little morsel, played around with it and spit it out. I gave the dog a few minutes and he did get up and eat the one cupful of food that was in the bowl. He does like Purina's wet food, that we give as a topping sometimes on another brand of dog food. I have uploaded a short video of his honest reaction to the first serving of this food. This is a rescue dog and when we got him about nine months ago he weighed 47 pounds, because he had eaten a 9" long ratchet wrench, with the handle and the head. This dog eats lots of stuff, the couch, my shoes, the remote, but he is not crazy about Beneful.<br /><br />The bag shows big chunks of beef, whole carrots, peas, whole grain wheat. Read the ingredient list before deciding to buy. The veggies are listed at position 20, 21, and 22, after a long list of corn products and other assorted junk food. The colors are really artificially bright, some of the pieces are hard, some soft, they are a nice size for smaller dogs. At my dog's weight, I would have to feed him six and a half cups, according to the chart on the bag. I really don't think he would eat it all. I did get this bag as a Vine promotion, with the hopes that it would be really good, but I think I will have to stick with our old brand.

review/summary: Not cat food but my dog likes it anyway
review/text: My dogs favorite dry food is the cats leftover science diet, if she can get it, so I'm not too sure about her street creds when it comes to choosing dog food, however she likes the Purina Beneful original dog food  for the time being. Any dry food she doesn't turn her nose up at is a plus.<br /><br />The bag shows chunks of real beef and veggies as well as a picture of the actual food. I don't think a reasonable person would expect to pour out actual beef chunks any more then they would expect to pour a fully frosted cake , like the one on the front of the box, from a box of cake mix. The product page and the back of the bag give the ingredients.  I sort of question the addition of sugar and I suppose the color is for the benefit of the owner but ,from what I've read, the chicken byproducts ( feet, neck etc) are good for the dog. No animal "waste" can be used. The word "meal" means the byproduct is received in a dry state instead of a wet state.<br /><br />I think the bottom line is do you trust the reputation and integrity of the manufacturer? It's probably not gourmet food but do you trust them to put out a healthy product? Do you believe they get their ingredients from a reputable company and run all the required salmonella and bacterial tests? Since I'm no expert on dog food that's what I have to do.

review/summary: Can I give this no stars?
review/text: OK, I am a veterinarian with a Masters in nutrition if this helps my credibility) and one of my most common questions to owners when they bring in a dog with year-round allergies and/or ear infections is "Is your dog on Beneful or Kibbles 'N Bits?" If they are and I put them on a grain-free diet they almost always get better. I've even seen dogs seizure when they get switched to this.  I would never let my own pets touch this stuff.  I have found that other vets experience the same thing when they research the diets their patients are on.  That said, if your pet doesn't have any allergies to this you may be all right.  I have found that some patients get addicted to it, probably due to the processed oils and sugar that is included in the ingredient list.  The commercials do well to make you think it is good stuff - I once even had a brain surgeon client feed his dog this stuff so don't feel like you should have known better.  The foods I have had the best experience with is Nature's Recipe and Wellness.  I am also one of those vets that loves the raw diet if it is done correctly.

review/summary: Purina not molto Bene
review/text: The triumph of marketing and finance over science and medicine is the theme of this ersatz dog food.  Have you ever seen a better dressed bag of dog food?  Snow White background with high tone graphics of floating ears of corn and amber grain just waving at you.<br /><br />Then, they were smart enough to have a really good reseal mechanism to open and close without a care.  No squeezing or stretching, struggling with those insane tracks you press together, sort of.  Beautiful.<br /><br />Open the bag and it is a riot of colors.  Better than anything Post or Kellogg can dish out.  And the doggie looks like the Quaker Oats guy.  This is genius.<br /><br />Smells like a bag of jumbo Fritos.  My 14 1/2 year old Corgi came sailing over my shoulder like a linebacker.  Okay girl, what do you think of this?  A cup and a half was gone quicker than you can say chicken by-product meal.  Say what? No, not chicken.  Just the by-product, made into "meal".  And that is only second in proportion.  The first is corn meal.  Third is corn gluten meal.  Then comes the wheat flour, followed by preserved animal fat.<br /><br />Why do we feed cattle corn?  Okay, yes, I know it is highly subsidized by tax dollars.  Besides that?  It makes them cows nice and fat on the cheap.  And what do Cattle produce, anybody?  Right, methane.  And now so does my dog.  There is probably no connection.  It might not even be mentioned in the other reviews; but please do not go by my review alone.  Excuse me while I open the window.  Maybe not quite enough calcium carbonate.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is propylene glycol and sugar both.  Yes that was the stuff added to Austrian dessert wine to make it sweet until they were caught.  You only see it in anti-freeze now (not to be confused with the more common ethylene) because the FDA has banned it in cat food.  And several sodium compounds.<br /><br />What bothers me most is that they knew how to do it right for us.

review/summary: Dog Prefers This - Actually Loves It
review/text: To sum it all up, the dog loves this food vs. the normal dog food we give him.  When I mixed this 30% to 70% of his regular dog food, he made a mess getting at the new stuff vs. the old.  I have a small dog (12 pounds) and these are just the right size for him to chew.<br /><br />I also did a "taste test" for him by putting some of this in a bowl right next to his regular dog food - he went straight to the Purina after giving each a sniff.<br /><br />What else can I say?  I can't comment on the flavor, texture, and other qualities of the food as I certainly didn't taste it!  However, based upon the dog's reaction I would say it's a winner.

review/summary: "Wholesale" Ingredients... Enough said!
review/text: If you read the blurb regarding this product you will find that your pet will be ingesting "wholesale" ingredients.  Over a year ago we used to feed our dog Beneful; after reading the label upon arrival I was reminded again why we stopped feeding him this overpriced garbage.<br /><br />Our cats are fed Science Diet Sensitive Stomach and our dog was/is eating a previously reviewed Vine product, Iams Sensitive Naturals Ocean Fish.  He is about to finish up that 25 pound bag.  After the bag finishes, I will have to walk into a pet store and methodically read the ingredients list before choosing another brand.  I would remain with the Iams Natural but I am concerned by the dry stools.  Then again, that is better than runny stools.<br /><br />Purina Beneful Original Dog Food's main ingredients are:<br />Ground Yellow Corn<br />Chicken By-Product meal<br />Corn Gluten Meal<br />Whole Wheat Flour<br />Preserved Animal Fat<br /><br />This is not good nor healthy!  This product is loaded with corn, corn and chicken by-product (read: eyeballs and beaks!).<br /><br />Did Furbie(Cock-a-poo)love it?  YES, but he also struggled with the kibble size and would always leave the uglier colored hard bits.  We would replenish the bowl and throw away the graveyard of green & yellow bits that remained.<br /><br />DO not recommend!  There are healthier alternatives priced right.  This is over-priced and comparable to the bottom of the barrel off-name brands.

review/summary: Dog loves it, price is a bit high, question the quality of ingredients
review/text: I love the idea of Amazon delivering things like this direct to my door. And my dog Cody loves it, but then again, he'll eat about anything (he's outside this very moment trying to catch & eat Cicadas, so he's not exactly a connoisseur!)<br /><br />However, I have some problems with this product. First, the price is a bit high (currently $21 on Amazon, but only $15 at Target or Walmart).<br /><br />Second, I really question the quality of ingredients. In the first 10 or 15 ingredients, there are only *two* real foods - wheat is #5 and beef is #7. And I'm not even certain that wheat is an essential ingredient. Otherwise it's all filler. Corn is not good for dogs (not digestible for any mammals, actually). Sugar is not good for dogs. Chicken "by-product" means ground-up bones, fat, tendons, things like that. And, there are a lot of petroleum-based dyes, preservatives, etc.<br /><br />Most importantly, for about the same price ($1.35 per pound), you can buy the good stuff. For example, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CICX6">Prairie Natural Dry Dog Food</a> is only $1.48 per pound.<br /><br />My recommendation (regardless whether you feed your pet the cheap stuff or not) is to supplement your pet's diet with scraps from your kitchen. We never ever feed our dog from the table or while we're cooking, but instead we'll peel the fat off chicken or keep little chunks of veggies & keep it in the fridge for his next meal. This will save you money and ensure your dog gets some fresh foods in his/her diet, some essential enzymes, etc.

review/summary: Mixed feelings on this.
review/text: I'm torn on this dog food. On one hand, my dogs love it. The bowl doesn't stay full for very long. They've been so picky with dog food that it was a relief to find something they would willingly eat. However, my Corgi liked to just pick out the soft pieces and leave the hard food for my Chihuahua. Because she only ate the soft pieces and gorged until the bowl was empty, my Corgi became overweight and her dental health suffered. We had to switch to a different brand to keep her healthy.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who feels the packaging is false advertising. There is no meat or vegetables in Beneful. It says right on here that the first two ingredients are ground cornmeal and chicken by-product. Yuck! That really grossed me out. I don't want my dogs eating this anymore and switched them to a more wholesome brand.

review/summary: Not "Natural"
review/text: I was extremely disappointed with this product and here's why:<br />A dog's natural diet is meat and greens, and maybe a tiny<br />amount of fruit. The main ingredient in this dog food is<br />corn meal. (There are also wheat and rice flour in this<br />product.) It also contains sugar (!) and 4 different<br />artificial colors (!!!!). Who is the color for? Do dogs<br />care about color? No! Shame on you, Purina - this is not a<br />"natural food" for a dog.

review/summary: Lily's New Favorite
review/text: I have the most finicky, persnickity shih-tzu in the world. I have spent, literally, hundreds of dollars on organic, grain-free, all-natural, blah, blah, blah dry dog food for her and I have ended up giving it to my co-workers (for their dogs, although the thought has crossed my mind. Think THE HELP.) For a while she was all gung ho on Chef Michael's dog food but she stopped eating it after a few weeks. Then came Beneful.<br /><br />From the minute she tried it she has been happy as a little clam. Other reviewers have claimed that this brand of dog food is full of fillers and bad things but at this point I don't really give a hoot. If my almost 13-year-old litle princess will eat it willingly and enthusiastically then it could be supplemented with spider eggs and I wouldn't care. I am so sick and tired of trying to hand feed her, piece by piece, that if she is willing to eat Beneful without my cajoling then we have a winner.<br /><br />At night when she sleeps with me I have noticed that she has a bit more gas now and that gas is stinkier than it has been in the past, but I guess turnabout is fair play. Overall, I couldn't be happier with Beneful, and as long as Lily will eat it then I will continue to buy it.

review/summary: Good Treat Alternative
review/text: The bottom line is that this is probably one of the healthier types of what we call "fast dog food" out there--and as far as dogs are concerned it smells great.  When it was being delivered to our house, our neighbor's (extremely well-behaved) little dog tore across the street to try to get the food from the post-man.  (The poor man is terrified of dogs.)  Our own dogs tried chewing through the box it came in and then, when the box was opened and the bag removed (and placed safely atop the fridge) decided to take up residence in the box.<br /><br />And the sturdiness of the bag and its "ziplock type" top probably pretty much guarantee that the food will stay smelling great.  Unfortunately, the ingredients do not live up to the smells.<br /><br />The food does have 25% protein but that's not really enough for former wolves.  Especially ones who, like ours, are getting on in years and hence, have a harder time absorbing the protein they do get.  In addition, relatively little of that protein is from chicken or other type of meats.  A lot of it comes from corn and gluten.  That's not necessarily a good thing.  And there is a lot of food coloring and preservatives thrown into the mix to boot.  And I doubt that the meat which this food does have is "human grade" like the meat in Canidae that we normally feed our dogs.<br /><br />Having said all that, this food is better than a lot of the dog foods you will find on the shelves.  It doesn't have saw dust for starters.  And, as a snack or treat it's probably the healthier alternative to the snacks you see on the shelves.<br /><br />And, since it smells great and is likely to for some time, that's probably a good use for it.

review/summary: It may not be the healthiest but for those on a budget, the Beneful Adult Dry Dog Food will provide the vitamins your dog needs
review/text: You're probably reading the reviews on Amazon about the "Purina Beneful Original Dog Food" and wondering, should I or shouldn't I buy this product.<br /><br />And you will have passionate dog owners who will go as far as too cook their dogs meals to spending much more for their dog in order to keep them healthy.  And then you also have dog owners, who can't cook their dogs meals, who can't spend a lot on dog food but just want their dog to be fed but also receiving the vitamins and nutrients that are available.<br /><br />I'm not an animal nutritionist but I liken it to my friends.  I have friends who will go to Whole Foods and spend heavily on healthy products, while I have friends who will go the 99 cent store to purchase their spinach or salad or the Grocery Outlet because they are on an extreme budget.<br /><br />The fact is that in this economy, not everyone can spend that much and so, a lot of people look for what is best within their budget.  And the fact is that Purina Beneful products are cheap dollars cheaper than other brands.  It's affordable and when you scan through the ingredients, most will primarily look for the vitamins and just making sure their dog receives the nutrients that they need.<br /><br />I have fed my dogs Beneful before and they love it.  But I know at the same time that dog lovers are adamant to not feed foods with high fat and carbohydrates to your dog.  I use the human comparison that you have friends who can shop at Whole Foods and spend more, while you have the family on the budget purchasing .99 cent pizzas, TV dinners, bacon, rice and spaghetti noodles that are cheaper but yet are not exactly the healthiest.<br /><br />And I have friends who debate on this topic of food they feed themselves and food that they feed their dogs but what it all comes down to is what one is willing to spend or can spend for dog food.<br /><br />There are already a plethora of reviews for those who will tell you this Beneful product is not healthy for your dogs and then you will read those who are on a budget that will tell you that their dogs love it.<br /><br />For my experience alone, I know my dogs love Beneful.  But I don't purchase Beneful all the time.  We have purchased this product in the past to try out but also purchased for what was within our monetary budget at the time.<br /><br />Do I recommend it?  I recommend it based on price for those who are strictly on a budget, not based on ingredients.<br /><br />Purina advertises it as 100% complete and balanced nutrition with wholesome grains and real beef, accented with vitamin-rich vegetables.  For some that may be all that want to know about this product...low price and that their dogs will get a balanced nutrition.  And if that's the case, then go for it!  Otherwise, if you are a person who is hesitant because you want the best food for your dog, then already, you know the answer.  This one is not for you.

review/summary: Beneful Dog Food Has its Share of the Good, and the Bad
review/text: Beneful is an inexpensive dog food from Purina, one of the original and best- known names in pet food. This particular Purina product is a little different from most in that it contains different colors and shapes of kibbles along with vegetables for a supposedly better- balanced diet.<br /><br />Beneful is an easy to find dog food sold in most stores, including both pet foods and grocery stores/supermarkets. Its widely available status and low price make it an easily recognizable and popular  product and its re-sealable bag is very convenient. It keeps the food inside and undesirable things out, so that the dog food remains fresh and edible for a long time.<br /><br />Name recognition, popularity, low price, nice packaging- these are all good extras, but what about the dog food itself? Well, it seems to be hit and miss with this product. The level of protein isn't too bad and the level of fat is kept under control, but the ingredient list is cause for concern. The first four ingredients are ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and whole wheat flour. These are not the ingredients you want to see at the top of a list for your dog's primary source of nutrition. Dogs need meat- not meat by products but real, quality meat- and the best quality dog foods have meat listed first.<br /><br />Some of the other ingredients are equally questionable. The dried peas and carrots are fine, but look at all of those artificial colors. Yes, it does make the food look pretty when poured into a bowl, but this is more for human appeal- a dog really doesn't care about seeing varied hues in its food. A dog just wants something that tastes good while you, the owner, want something with quality and good nutrition.<br /><br />Speaking of the taste, Beneful does score points in this area and that might be a good part of the reason why so many dog owners buy this for their canine friends. Dogs really love this food, and my dog is no exception. He will finish off a large bowl without even pausing and he seems anxious for more.<br /><br />So, how do I rate Beneful dog food overall? Well, I find it has both good points and bad points. It worst quality is the ingredients, but then again, when I look at the ingredients of other dog foods in the same price range, what I see on the Beneful label isn't all that bad. Dogs love the taste, and the nutritional aspects are okay. Thus, when all factors are considered, Beneful rates average overall. It can't compare to the high- quality dog food brands sold in many pet stores, but it has enough good points to recommend it-- barely.

review/summary: My Dogs Like This Too Much
review/text: First of all, this is not strictly dry dog food...there are chewy pieces, which turned my dogs into ravenous maniacs.<br /><br />I have two small dogs that weigh 10 lbs and 13 lbs; we keep a full dog feeder in the kitchen, so they can eat as much as they want, whenever they want. They are light eaters; they are in excellent physical condition, and we only feed them dry dog food (no soft food at all) and the occasional dog biscuit. We never had a problem with this arrangement in the fourteen years that we've had our dogs.<br /><br />I made the mistake of pouring some of this dog food into the feeder before it was completely empty. The dogs systematically tossed the old dog food pieces out of the feeder dish onto my floor. Then they started plucking out the chewy pieces, although they do seem to enjoy all the morsels...they just want to eat their favorite pieces first.<br /><br />As a result of their enthusiasm for the Purina Beneful, I swear they have pooped more in the past week than they have in the past year. Luckily, they did not develop diarhea (sp?) from the diet change.<br /><br />Obviously, my dogs love it, but I will not be leaving it in the feeder...we will have to switch to measured meals at specific times.<br /><br />On a side note: the resealable bag is not spillproof. I knocked the bag on its side, and it popped open, spilling the contents everywhere.

review/summary: I like the bag, dogs like the taste, nobody likes the "nutrition"
review/text: The best thing about this dog food is the bag's 'ziploc' style top, keeping dog food (& dog food odor) inside the bag instead of spilling out into my cupboard, and keeping any insects or cupboard-opening dogs out.  I love it.  Why doesn't every dog food bag have this?<br /><br />I also have to say that both of my dogs (greyhound and mix) love the food and gobble it up with relish.  But, you know, my teenagers would gobble up chips and candy and soda with relish if I let them.  It's junk food.  It may taste good, but it's empty calories.  Fine for sometimes (I mixed it in with their regular food), but not good as the only source of nutrition.<br /><br />And nutrition (or lack thereof) is the reason I wouldn't buy this food.  Just check the first 7 ingredients:  Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of vitamin E), rice flour, beef [and then more fillers and chemicals].  Note that beef is actually the seventh ingredient, and that corn, meal, flour, and tallow (fat)are the main ingredients.  Gross.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  Tasty and well-packaged junk food, but junk nonetheless.

review/summary: Some good healthy ingredients
review/text: I give this pet food A plus for palatability as my five dogs all seem to love the flavor of it. And that's important. I've recently invested in expensive, organic premium pet food for both dogs and cats and have been very disappointed because my pets simply would eat very little of it because it wasn't tasty. How to explain that it's good for them?<br /><br />The pluses of this food: Definitely the vegetable ingredients. I think that dogs need vegetables, not just meat. They include corn (not the most nutritious of vegetables but both animals and birds love it), peas (always highly nutritious) and carrots. The flour ingredients are whole wheat and soy flour, both healthful. The beef is real beef.<br /><br />How much of all of these ingredients? We don't know.<br /><br />Vitamin supplements include Vitamins E, A, B12, D3 and menadane sodium bisulfite, said to be a source of Vitamin K activity. I do know what that means. Hopefully, it is beneficial. Minerals, such as zinc sulfate and manganese, are included as well.<br /><br />The food pieces are not too big and not too small so that one can be comfortable offering them to any size of dog, which I did ranging from a chihuahua to a shepherd-chow mix. It was quite suitable for both, and the in-between size ranges.<br /><br />Minuses: I would prefer the chicken by-product meal be eliminated. It can come from pretty messy stuff and one wonders if it is a filling, for flavor enhancement, or some other unnecessary purpose. It just has a negative ring to it. The other ingredient I'm not completely comfortable with is the food dye, although I did some research on the web and it is not considered to be harmful if not used in big quantities.<br /><br />Yes, this is pretty dog food, pleasing to the human eye. And it comes in six different shapes. I find it fascinating that the package claims the benefit of the shapes is that it makes them seem like real pieces of meat to dogs, suggesting that a single uniform shape would not. I don't know if research has been done on canine recognition of shapes, but that does make some sense in their ancestral memory.<br /><br />All in all, I feel comfortable feeding this original Beneful to my dogs and do enjoy their enjoyment of it and pleasure in it. There is better food, but it is more costly and I don't believe it can be obtained at mainline supermarkets, which means trips to two different stores to shop for groceries. In its price range and thinking of its competition (Iams is the only other grocery store-bought dog food I would consider), I think it is a good offering albeit with the above "minuses" to take into consideration.<br /><br />One more word: I love the packaging. No more ripping off the top and searching for some clamp to reseal the package with. The entire top of the package has this slide zipper just as on Ziploc bags. Opens easily and fully. Neat!

review/text: Beneful does a lot of things well in terms of dog food.  The food is colorful and much more appetizing than many other foods on the market that are simply one color of brown.  Humans like variety in food so your dog should too, right?  The bag design is the best I've seen on the market.  It has a zip close at the top to keep food fresh.  I've bought more expensive foods that don't include that...genius.  I was all for the product...until I read the ingredients.  This food is not nutritionly sound.  Wanna guess the first three ingredients...ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten. These are not things you would want to feed your family, so why would you feed it to your dog?  My dog liked the taate, but in the future if I'm gonna spend this on food, I will buy a more quality product.  It is equal to just about every other store brand dog food on the market.  Good try Purina...I wanted to like Beneful.

He loves the taste and it is healthier for him. 5/5 stars.

review/summary: LOL!!!!!!!!! My CATS are fighting over this one - they believe it's their food!
review/text: Poor Doggie, all he can do is sit there, watch, and whimper the moment I opened this bag; immediately my 2 Cats came running over. I am babysitting a Dog while the neighbor is in the Nursing Home in Therapy. It was totally unreal! The cats were literally fighting over it, while I have a 20 year old and a 6 year old which left me scratching my head. They never had any interest in dog food before, but my heart was going out as my neighbor will be transferred to a different facility for more therapy before he returns back home and his wife isn't able to handle him (their dog) as they are elderly. I knew their dog was overweight and been working on putting him back in shape. I had to feed him somewhere else but it didn't take long for the younger cat to find where the food was until having to put the dog, food, and water in the bathroom. Under observation, he just literally snarfed it up in a glup and tried to rip the bag open for more! He loved it; I gave him 4 cups already, so provided him only one half cup (*POOF - GONE*), already smacking, licking, and arfing with begging for more. Had to put the bag in the back room. Right now, he's been sitting in the back room as he knows where his food is along with his food bowl as if somehow the food is going to "magically" fill his food bowl up. I cannot express how fast he downed that food; in comparison to his regular Vet recommended "Top of the Line" Brand name food which he often doesn't finish.  10 paws up for this one! WOOF!  I wished I could put a video of this but by reason this is not my dog but my neighbor's, I already asked his wife if I may run a video of this and her response was "NO!".  But I can tell you that their dog is 14 years old!

review/summary: Dogs Loved This Food! People Like the Convenience but still concerned over quality
review/text: We have two rescue dogs both of which had major medical issues when we adopted them. In order to reduce the medical problems, we always try to use the same food as they had been fed in the past so over the years, Pedigree seemed to be the food of choice. We mix/match the flavors but generally stick to dry mixed with canned Pedigree brand.<br /><br />This arrived via home delivery in a box along with two other deliveries (spouses new shoes). While we were busy taking a look a the new shoes, our two dogs immediately started sniffing the box with the bag of food inside. In fact, our little "bagle" (beagle/basset mix) decided to stand guard and adopt it as her very own. We went ahead, opened the bag and both noses were immediately sniffing all over the bag. Now, it should be said, our dogs are an itsy bitsy bit spoiled and routinely get their own treats or deliveries so they knew this was for them.<br /><br />We offered a handful and each gulped it down happily. Put a few in a kong toy and they thought it was a great treat. Dinner time and they consumed it in record time. Plain and simple...this is a HUGE hit!<br /><br />Now, from the people perspective, the bag is very sturdy and has a zip lock resealable closure which is super nice and convenient. It doesn't require having to empty into a separate storage container which is especially nice for those that have mutiple dog households and hate having to lug/tug big bags home only to be forced to empty into yet another secure storage area.<br /><br />There seem to be additional vitamins, minerals etc which appears competitive with Pedigree. On the other hand, (knock on wood) Pedigree was one of the very few companies not involved in recent recalls over the past few years which means a lot. I'm not yet sure if we will make a full switch but we will be at least partially adding this to the menu since our dogs absolutely love it however, we absolutel love our dogs and have not fed any Purina brand foods until now. I'd really like to know where the ingredients are coming from (China, USA?) and still feel hesitant to return to a company that caused so much pain and suffering in the past.

review/summary: Picky Shih-Tzu eats it mixed with canned food....
review/text: I was surprised when my picky shih-tzu, who won't  eat dog food snacks, ate Beneful Original Dog Food. Granted he only eats a few pieces when I put it on top of his canned food serving, but he does eat it.  (He will only it eat if I mix it with his canned food).  It didn't upset his digestive system or cause any poo problems.<br /><br />Our mutt loves Beneful Original Dog Food, but then she eats anything.<br /><br />It's packaged in a  sturdy plastic bag that closes with a zipper.<br /><br />The kibble  includes mixed sizes of crunchy pieces and semi-moist pieces.<br /><br />Satisfaction guaranteed or your purchase price will be refunded. Follow the guidelines printed on the package.

review/summary: Two Paws Up
review/text: My dogs are non-verbal, at least, not in a language I understand.  So they didn't have a lot to say about Beneful.  But, I take it as a "two paws up" when the bowl is empty soon after I fill it.  We have a pomeranian and a bichon and neither have ever had issues with weight.  But our bichon does tend to get rashes if she eats foods that don't agree with her.  We've generally just bought store brand dog food and that's been fine, but they poop a lot because of the fillers.  I noticed with Beneful, they still poop every day, but not as much and they seem much more energetic.  So, we've decided to stick with Beneful because the price isn't bad and it works for our pups!

review/summary: This was a big hit!
review/text: I have three dogs that gave me feedback on this product.  A golden retriever, 12 years old, a pug that is 7 yrs old and a papillion that is 2 yrs old.  I placed the Beneful out on their feed dish this morning after removing the "other product" that they usually get in the morning.  The usual response is one of boredom.  "We'll get to it when we get around to it."  This morning there was a rush to the bowl to get their equal share of this new dog food.<br />The appearance of the product is good and one I felt good about giving to me dogs.  Vibrant, healthy looking colors made me feel like they were getting some healthy vegetables in the mix too.<br />This definitely warrants a suggestion from me to consider buying this product for your dogs.  In addition the name Purina makes me feel like I am giving my loved pets something that will be good for them.

review/summary: Dogs love it, picture on bag is very misleading.
review/text: I have a huge dog and a wee beagle. I won't lie, they would eat anything and have tried. (Well, they won't eat cucumber peelings if they drop on the floor. Weird.) I served them Beneful and they woofed it down, no problem. :)  I do believe that the bag picture and name are misleading, as well as the ad campaign for this dog food. It's not very beneficial for your dog and the top ingredients are total junk and filler. I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X63VS">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Senior Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a> but it's way, way more expensive. With Beneful, you are going to see a LOT of waste, so to speak, when your dog `goes for a walk'. There is a belief that if you feed your dog good, quality food, there is less waste because there is so much nutrition being gleaned from the food. I'd say this is true, but not so much less waste that you can..oh...get another dog, or take smaller poo-bags on your walks. (hahaha) This food is more like, homemade play dough. If you took homemade play dough, which is mostly salt, and shaped it into the form of a carrot and a chunk of steak, then ate it, you would still be eating salt, not meat or veggies. Beneful looks like food, but it's mostly junk. Why the four stars? Because I've been feeding my dogs cheap food all their lives, and fed the same kind of food to my passed-on dogs and they all did fine. They all lived to their life's expectancy and beyond. No health issues, ever (except for a dog-ate-a-corncob-incident, which if you think about it, I would not have had with just kibble!) and they had/have energy, healthy teeth, coats that shine etc. Overall, if you can afford better food, I say go for it.

review/summary: Dog enjoyed it, but poor grade food overall
review/text: My dog is a 62lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially food allergies. He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his food so finding the right mix can often be difficult. While he loves just about any treat, I always have reservations about trying new food. Unfortunately, a large majority of popular dog foods today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new food so here are my thoughts on PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Dog liked it and gobbled it up.<br /><br />+ Resealable Ziploc style bag.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Filled with tons of poor ingredients for your dog such as Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol, meat and bone meal, animal digest, added color (Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 2), garlic oil, menadione sodium bisulfite complex. Artificial colors? Seriously? Do you really think the dog cares what color the food is when they eat it? Who are we trying to appeal to here, the dog or the person?<br /><br />- $22 is a bit expensive for a 15.5lb bag.  This food is often much cheaper at big box retailers and grocery stores.<br /><br />- Bag is plastic and currently not recyclable.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food.  However don't we all enjoy food that's bad for us? Unfortunately, that's exactly what this dog food is, bad for your dog. Someone said in a previous review if my dog was reviewing this food it would get 5 stars and my dog would agree with that. Lucky for him I know what's good for his health and PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food isn't it. With so many questionable and downright poor ingredients it's hard to really recommend this food for your dog. I definitely wouldn't purchase it again. Our current food is Nature's Domain Turkey Meal and Sweet Potato which is sold at Cost Co. It contains no potentially harmful ingredients, settles very well with my dog and is only $30 for a 25lb bag. If you're looking for a good healthy food, I recommend Nature's Domain brand or if you want to better educate yourself on what's actually in your current dog food I suggest visiting dogfoodadvisor.com. It's a great site that lists nearly all dog foods, breaks every ingredient and its properties down and gives a final overall rating on the food's quality.

review/summary: Poor quality
review/text: I was sadly disappointed with the quality of this dog food.  The first several ingredients were either corn, corn filler or byproducts.  With a name like Beneful and the pictures representing healthy ingredients the consumer is too believe that the ingredients are top notch, the best there is for your dog.<br /><br />That's far from the truth, and with the lackluster appetite my dog had for the food I gave away the bag to local animal shelter and they didn't even want it and in turn gave it away to some other agency.  What else can be said when a local animal shelter doesn't even want a bag of Beneful.<br /><br />The proof is in the bag.  Filler ingredients, that are neither fit for beast or beast, let alone to be purchased from man.  Do your dog a favor and buy something else.

review/text: The first four ingredients in this dog food are corn meal, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal and whole wheat flour. There is also sugar, soy and food coloring. Dogs don't care what it looks like, so the coloring is completely unnecessary. The other ingredients are not supposed to be part of a canine diet. Despite the fact my dog likes this food, it is not healthy for her and I could get the same product in the stores for $5 less than here on-line if I wanted. But, I will not be purchasing this dog food again.

review/text: Living on a budget as a graduate student, I considered Purina to be a kind of luxury for my dog, though any serious research on dog food, especially natural and organic, would prove otherwise. My dog, a Terrier/ Husky mix is not a picky eater and so is loves just about any kind of dog food scooped into his bowl. The packaging as other reviewers have noted does suggest wholesome ingredients that are quite absent from the actual ingredients listed on the back. After he finishes this bag, I might consider investing in slightly more expensive brands as other reviewers have noted.

review/summary: Excellent dog food
review/text: Purina's Beneful Original Dog Food in the 15.5 pound bag is an excellent dog food indeed.  This dog food was greatly appreciated by the three dogs in my life; they loved it, and would stand around the dog food bowl when it was empty, hoping that it would be filled forthwith.  (That is, when one of the dogs wasn't doing her "paw trick.")<br /><br />At any rate, the dogs really enjoyed this food.  And as it is a large bag full of food, if you have three dogs or so, it'll last you at least three weeks if used as directed.  So it's a good value and your dogs will really enjoy it (that is, if they're anything like the three I deal with every day) -- so what's not to like about that?<br /><br />Five stars, highly recommended.<br /><br />Barb Caffrey

The lovely image of an ear of corn on the side of the package should give us all a clue. Dogs and cats are frantic for grains, sure, and love to scarf them down, but this is not a good sign. I have a rescue sheltie that was a junk-food junkie (not just grains, but candy in fact fed to him by his original owner) before I got him and needs to stay on healthy food for the sake of his weight and teeth.<br /><br />I wish I'd looked at the ingredient label before ordering this on Vine, this is not suitable for my dog, or anyone's in my opinion.<br /><br />Benefil does have beautiful packaging and an excellent top closure. But I don't want to pick up up the giant "fluffy floaters" produced by a corn-heavy dog diet, nor do I want my dog to suffer digestive system pressure while processing this food. I gave my dog 1/2 cup of Benefil and then threw in the towel given the immediate fluffy-floaters produced.<br /><br />Purina should go back to the drawing board on this one.

review/summary: A good normal dog food
review/text: For the money, this is an OK dog food in many respects.<br /><br />First, the package is smart.  I love a resealable bag.  I tend to use a large storage bin: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00186RTWW">Iris MP-12-NAVY Airtight Pet Food Container, Navy Blue, 69 Quarts</a> but in this case, I just used the bag.<br /><br />Second, for taste, most dogs love it.  I have three, and they all enjoy this much more than they do the normal dog food that I provide them.  I think this is because this dog food is a bit like the food we eat... it's corn based and carby (it also has animal based protein and a balance of other things).  I think it's like a dinner at Chili's.  I enjoy food like that, but that doesn't mean it's the healthiest.<br /><br />Third, health: a lot of dog food reviews online are extreme.  These are dogs.  They evolved eating what man would leave them.  They do not necessarily need the extremely expensive dog foods I find at boutiques.  A dog food based on corn can be part of a nutritious diet.  This dog food does seem to have a more nutritious content than competitors at its price point.  However, it also has no chance of competing with dog foods that cost five times as much.  There is an obvious solution to this: when you eat your dinner, if you have some left over, particularly veggies and good proteins, put that on the kibble instead of throwing it out.  I've done this for years and my dogs are quite healthy.  Feeding three dogs a normal but relatively healthy dog food like this, and also supplementing that with fresh food, is an effective and affordable solution.<br /><br />Fourth, value: For what it is, I think this is priced competitively.  If you're looking for something completely different and wouldn't consider a mass produced corn based dog food, then of course this isn't for you, and that's fine.

review/text: This is dog food and therefore, I did not consume it myself -- however, based on the colors and shapes of the kibbles, I think Beneful assumes that I will.<br /><br />My dogs ate the food just fine -- no digestive issues and no real complaints... but they are dogs... they would eat out of my cat's litter box if I let them.<br /><br />What struck me as a human is how colorful the kibbles are -- lots of reds and greens. Really? I'm guessing that isn't natural food color there but added to make the food look more appetizing to humans. I'm not a natural health food nut by any stretch of the imagination but even the skeptic in me thinks that at a minimum, they are spending a lot of money on the appearance of the food where I would rather know that that money was going towards nutrition.<br /><br />Finally, I can't be sure but I do believe my dogs are actually "passing a lot more gas" since they have been eating this food. If that is true, that is yet another reason not to use this food in the long run... my house is stinky enough as it is without the contributions of my dogs.<br /><br />[NCJVR]

review/summary: PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound -Discount dog food
review/text: My dog likes this -probably more than his regular food.  However, this is not the best choice for a healthy diet for him, in my opinion.  I was actually surprised at the ingredients. You have to go down the ingredients list to item number seven to hit beef, which is the first real meat on the list, and five of the first eight are grains/fillers.  The peas and carrots they show on the bag fall in well behind sugar, sorbitol, salt and potassium chloride, but at least ahead of the four artificial colors added.  Sorbitol is both a sweetener and a laxative and not something I'd have my dog on for any length of time.<br /><br />I think if your dog is a really picky eater, but likes this food due to its flavor and different shapes, then it would be ok and better than not eating enough.  However, this is a pretty low quality food compared to what else is on the market.  Grains and animal by-product should not be the first four ingredients in your dog's diet, unless it is the only food your dog will eat day after day.  I will be switching my dog back to Authority Lamb and Rice and leave him on it until he tires of it or they change the recipe.  It is only slightly more expensive than this food, but he needs less of it (less filler) on a daily basis, so it probably works out close to the same cost.  It also isn't the best food on the market, but it is much better than this one with more meat and less fillers and additives, and it agrees with him.

review/summary: Update: dog likes it and it agrees with her sensitive stomach
review/text: UPDATE: My dog has a "nervous tummy" and you never know what will upset her. Blue Buffalo (a very good quality food) absolutely did not agree with her. I also tried Beaver Dam. I tried various foods, made my own blend, and of all the foods, this one agrees well with her system. Yes, it's not the top meat ingredients (by-product meal and corn, both considered poor quality.) But she's thriving and growing on this food. Go figure. I like the resealable bag. Remember to seal it however. The cat crawled inside the bag once, and I found him, how many minutes (hours?) completely inside, munching in a coma of bliss. No harm done, either (not recommended however for cats. Mine is a stray and a glutton of astonishing capacity.)<br /><br />This is a nice soft kibble dog food that has an aroma of fresh vegetables when you open the bag. So it really does have a variety of ingredients to nourish the dog.<br /><br />However, the first three ingredients are of concern: corn, chicken by product meal and corn gluten meal. Some dogs are sensitive to corn and chicken by-product meal is ground up chicken carcases and offal (innards and bones with any attached meat) and is less digestible than chicken meat. For example, I feed my dog a mix of offal (gizzards, livers and hearts) ground up or mixed with chicken thigh.<br /><br />Corn is a debatable ingredient. It is cheap. (So is chicken by-product meal.) It is possible allergenic and certainly less digestible than rice. If your dog can digest it, it may be ok (though there is some feeling corn is involved in various dog diseases like diabetes and obesity. The corn helps the kibbling process (it's starchy.)<br /><br />Bottom line: top three ingredients are cheap ingredients and your dog may not benefit. Some dogs get allergies and skin irritations from corn. My dog enjoys this and when I'm not making dog mash (with brown rice, turkey thigh and green beans and supplements) this is what she eats. She loves it. For grocery store dog food, it isn't bad.<br /><br />Ingredients: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, sorbitol, tricalcium phosphate, water, animal digest, salt, phosphoric acid, potassium chloride, dicalcium phosphate, sorbic acid (a preservative), l-lysine monohydrochloride, dried peas, dried carrots, calcium carbonate, calcium propionate (s preservative), choline chloride, vitamin supplements (E, A, B12, D3),

We shouldn't be feeding dogs food based on corn, chicken by-products, animal digest (!), dried peas, dried carrots, etc.; foods that our vet don't recommend.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Nicely concocted food that our dogs like to eat but filled with questionable ingredients that may not be beneficial for our dogs in the long term.

review/summary: Not as nutritious as the package implies
review/text: The product name and package look so wonderful, so beneficial for your dog.<br /><br />The ingredients aren't so wonderful though.<br /><br />The top ingredients are:<br /><br />* Ground yellow corn<br />* Chicken by-product meal (What does that mean, chicken eyelids and nail clippings?)<br />* Corn gluten meal<br />* Whole wheat flour<br /><br />I've had more than one vet advise us to stay away from dogfoods where the top ingredients are corn, gluten, and animal by-products. The rationale is that the corn and gluten can lead to behavior problems with the dogs, and that the animal by-products aren't the real meat that you want to feed your dog.<br /><br />I gave some to my dog to see how she liked it. I didn't want to upset her stomach, so I mixed it 50/50 with her regular IAMS kibble. I figured she would do like my kids do, gravitate towards the junk food, but she actually avoided the Beneful. She ate her IAMS first and then ate some (but not all) of the Beneful.

review/summary: Rancidity nearly knocked me off my feet and activated gag reflex
review/text: I know, I know, I should be grateful for anything I receive through Vine because I got it for FREE! I guess I do feel grateful to find out what doesn't work for me and my dog. My smiling UPS man delivered this PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound right to my front door,gave my dog a scratch behind the ears, and set it right inside the door for me. The box was slightly squished but still taped shut. I cut the box open being careful not to cut the Beneful bag only to find that Amazon had packed it very nicely with lots of brown packing paper so my Amazon packaging and delivery experience was pretty excellent but that doesn't go in a product review so I will get back to the review! Upon opening the cardboard box flap, a waft of rancid oil smell hit me right in the nose and knocked me backwards so much it nearly knocked me over. I knew I had to deal with it quick before the rancid odor spread throughout our clean fresh smelling home! Is the smell coming from the box (sniff=no odor), the packing paper (sniff=slight odor=woozy), or the Beneful bag? (sniff=gag gag gag). OMG If it is not fit for a human to smell, it is not fit for a dog to eat! This dogfood is called Beneful with lots of healthy foods pictured next to a dog making you think this dog food is full of benefits for your beloved furry friend. However, what it should have is a dog rolled over on his side, sick, with a clothespin on his nose! I did not feel grateful for feeling nauseated and woozy, but hey, you know what? After writing my review, I do feel grateful! Go figure.<br /><br />I don't think Beneful is full of benefits for us but maybe to Monsanto because the ingredients are probably all GMO.<br /><br />Thank you Vine!

review/summary: Puppy Likes It
review/text: This PURINA Beneful Organic Dog Food is well liked by the retriever puppy we tested it on, but I do have concerns with the nutritional content. I was fairly sure taste was not going to be an issue since this puppy will eat just about anything put in front of her, intended or not.<br /><br />This is packaged in a very easy to open and resealable bag, which is a nice since this a lot of food that will last us awhile. The actual kibble is a mixture of shapes and consistencies, and I already noted that Sissy seems to very much enjoy it.<br /><br />The biggest issue is that has a lot of corn and wheat products, and has chicken by-product meal second in the ingredient list. While I'm not sure this isn't "good enough", there is much better available.<br /><br />This will not be our dog food of choice, but it will do if we catch it on sale.<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: My Dog Loves it but it's Not Great Nutrition
review/text: My dog went nuts when the box arrived with the Beneful inside. She sniffed, chewed, and scratched. She loved eating it too and wolfed it down in moments. I think she really liked the moist chunks and seemed to fish them out before eating the rest.<br /><br />So our dog gives it 5 stars but I'm not sure her vet or her health would give it that. The first ingredient in this dog food is corn, not great nutritional content. According to DogFoodAdvisor dot com the next ingredient is "chicken by-product meal, a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste. In a nutshell, chicken by-products are those unsavory leftovers usually considered 'unfit for human consumption'". And then it goes to corn gluten meal. Dog Food Advisor gives it 1 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />So, although it must taste great, it is not nutritionally great for your best furry friend (or hairless in the case of Chinese Crested!).

review/text: First off, the ingredients are questionable (more filler than anything else).  This may be enough to reconsider this purchase off the bat.  However, I have a large breed dog and we go through a lot of food, so the fact that Purina Beneful is very easy to find and affordable is key. And although my dog is not picky, he ate this up.  He's all tail wags while eating.  I definitely would purchase again especially in a pinch.

review/summary: PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food
review/text: My dog has been eating Blue Buffalo for a couple of reasons...one its not had<br />any recalls on it...but it IS expensive.  I decided to get this and try her on<br />it, as its not had any recalls either...and she LIKED it!  She has a bit of a<br />weight problem, so I was also happy to see that this was a bit less in calories<br />than what shes been eating.  She eats it right up, I add nothing but a bit of<br />water and let it sit for a couple of minutes, she still gets that 'crunch' but<br />also it helps bring out some of the flavors.  I WILL be purchasing this again,<br />they also offer other flavors and an adult version with lower calories.

review/summary: Mixed bag, but dog prefers it
review/text: Beneful has both soft (not moist, just soft) chunks and hard chunks, so you'd need to look elsewhere if your dog couldn't eat hard dog food.  Though beef is prominently mentioned on the package, mention is harder to find and is further down on the ingredients list.  However, it is preferred by my dog.  Though it shouldn't matter for a human, it's also more appetizing to look at.

Why don't all dog food bags come with a zippable top?  It makes storage so much easier, as well as keeps the smell of the food contained.  The food has a strong odor, compared with other brands I've used, so it needs it!

review/text: We normally feed both our dogs another product.  When we started giving them this, they scarfed it.  We had to mix it about 50/50 with their normal food so they didn't just keep emptying the bowl.  Still, they manage to pick this out first and save the rest for later.  Hasn't changed their pooping habits, which is wonderful.  Energy levels have stayed about the same, and no difference in coat.  I'd by happy to buy this for the beasties.

But she really likes this Beneful Dog Food. It has all the vitamins and nutrition that a dog needs.<br /><br />I also love the bag, it has a zip lock seal on top! Why don't other product do this? It is great at keeping the food fresh and this is especially important when you buy a big bag. It still feels and smells fresh at the bottom of the bag as it did when I first opened it. I'll take Button's word that it still tastes fresh ;)

review/summary: It does the trick
review/text: I have tried a lot of different foods with my dog, but this is the one we both like the best.  She is quite picky when it comes to the more expensive brands like science diet, iams, blue buffalo etc and won't eat them.  I guess she is a low class girl at heart because she will only eat the grocery store brands with out a hunger strike.  But she really like beneful.  It makes her coat shiny and she enjoys eating it.  The whole bag is a resealable container so you don't have to worry about transferring it, or having it get stale or rancid.  The only real negative I can say about this product is it sure doesn't smell very good. Maybe that's one of the things she likes about it, but I don't appreciate the very strong dog food smell.<br /><br />4 stars.

review/summary: Worth the money
review/text: What can I say about Purina Beneful Original Dog Food? This product came in a 15.5 lb bag which lasted my dogs roughly 9 days.  I am one of "those" owners that allows their dogs to have food in their bowls at all times so if the nine days seems short, that is why.  My dogs are huge; a husky and a chow/shepherd mix and they are outside dogs so having plenty of water and food at all times is what they are used to.  Both dogs seemed to enjoy eating the product and I tried to watch for any ill effects (stomach wise, etc) and saw nothing out of the ordinary.  When the dogs ate, they ate for about ten minutes and seemed to be full for a long time.  The dog food has nice ingredients and while corn is still a big by product of the food, my dogs seemed to find it tasty and they ate this dog food better than the dog food I have been feeding them for years. LOL<br /><br />I would buy it again; the price is a bit higher than some and less expensive than Iams.  Between the two, I would buy Beneful every time.<br /><br />Natalie S. for Amazon Vine

review/summary: Review: Purina Beneful Dog Food
review/text: I have both a dog and a cat.  Defying all expectations, its the dog that's finicky about his food (the cat will attempt to eat anything including the hand petting him).  My dog loves to chew on stuff (furniture, sticks, grass) but when it comes to dog food, he is really picky.  I've been using the Beneful brand of Purina Dog Food with him for at least a year and he loves it.<br /><br />I'd done some research into dog foods when we first moved to that brand.  What attracted us was that there was plenty of protein in the mix (along with egg) and that it was vitamin rich.  Its like the add...I like it because its good for him.  He likes it simply because he likes it.  It should be noted that there is a fair amount of corn and corn-product in the mix.  That's usually a sign of cheap filler...but the protein mix still seems ok.<br /><br />I was concerned about ordering dog food through the mail.  I've seen these bags sometimes rip when being handled but Amazon simply boxed and sent it.  It arrived in perfect condition, wrapped in paper.<br /><br />All in all, I think the product is solid.  My dog likes to eat it and it appears reasonably health for him.  Further, if you are considering ordering online, I believe you will be satisfied with the process.  I was and I'm going to order online from now on!

review/text: I have a toy party poodle, he usually eats Beneful Healthy Weight, but I've noticed he really eats the soft pieces and leaves the hard ones, I guess for when he is starving. He is 8yrs old and when I got him he was 4 and overweight, the previous owners fed him Kibbles & Bits. Anywhoo. I'm not a really good pet parent, I don't read lables  etc and I don't know what it's made from. he doesn't have nay health problems that we are aware of so I guess it's pretty good for a dog food. (I have seen and smelled worse)<br /><br />He eats this just like he does the healthy weight, no big difference. I think he will eat just about anything, but if you check my reviews you will see what he really goes crazy over..and for the sake of him not bouncing off the walls all day and getting into trouble..I only give that sparingly.

review/summary: Some Good, Some Bad
review/text: Last year we got our first family dog- a rescue JRT-mix.  My family had so much fun with Charlie-Amanda that we soon adopted another pooch, Pippin.  If you're wondering why I'm telling you all this, it's so that you have the background on where I'm coming from with respects to this review.  Essentially we love our pups and I spent a lot of time last year reading up on dog foods.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />The 15.5 pound bag of Beneful dog food comes nicely packaged.  It was delivered in a box that was appropriately sized.  The Beneful bag itself is super sturdy, plasticized, and has what looks to be a sturdy 'ziplock' opener at the top.  This is just the sort of thing you need with a large amount of kibble to keep it fresh and appealing to dogs.  So bonus points here (although the superior option would be biodegradable).<br /><br />THE KIBBLE:<br />The kibble is attractive and smells okay.  There are different sizes, shapes, textures, and colors.<br /><br />MY DOGS REACTION:<br />As I mentioned, I've got two pups.  One's a year old JRT-mix and the other's a 8 month-old Moyen-sized poodle.  They both thought that the food smelled interesting, but they didn't chow it down.  They would eat quite a bit if I hand fed them the kibble, but they'd only eat out of the bowl if they were very hungry.  In fairness I should note that they are the pickiest eaters in the universe, and sometimes they'll even turn their noses up at human chicken and hot dogs.  I expect most dogs would eat this food.  Certainly our neighbor's dog, who is always breaking into the house to scour it clean, gulped down every little tidbit.<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />--Much research has led me to understand that it can be difficult to calculate the actual price of a dog food.  "Cheap" dog foods, for example, may not be as cheap as they seem because dogs need to eat more of lower quality food than higher quality.  If you look at this example you'll see what I mean.  The Beneful package suggests that a dog of 15 pounds should eat around 1.25-to-1.7 cups of food per day.  A similarly sized dog need only eat 1 cup of Eukanuba small breed kibble.  Now Eukanuba appears to be more expensive per bag, but is it?<br /><br />My point is that those of us who are frugal need to crunch the numbers before they purchase.<br /><br />--Beneful is a low quality food source for dogs.  Dogs are omnivores but they really need protein and the first ingredients for Beneful are ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour.  Compare their 25% protein product with what I'm currently feeding my dogs which has 32% protein, and whose ingredients are Chicken, Chicken By-products and Corn meal.  And there are other products out there with even higher protein levels.<br /><br />--Keep in mind that some dogs are allergic to corn and food dyes.  If your pup is one of these, skip Beneful.<br /><br />CONTROVERSY:<br />--There's a number of controversies surround Beneful and it's manufacturer, Nestl&eacute; Purina.  The parent company, Nestl&eacute;, has been involved in a number of recalls for both human and pet foods.  They use ingredients from China for the dog food, and there are many complaints against them in 2012 for dog treats.<br /><br />--The Dog Food Advisor website gives Beneful 1-Star for high fat and carbohydrate levels.<br /><br />CONCLUSIONS<br />Beneful is an okay product.  It's the type of dog food that my grandmother would have purchased in bulk to feed the strays she was always taking in.  It is VERY convenient to have it delivered, and the packaging is excellent, and for some people who have a difficult time getting out of the house, this is going to be a great option.<br /><br />Currently Beneful appears to be safe to use.  Nestl&eacute;'s reputation is not sterling however and dog owners should keep an eye to the news for recalls and reports of poisons since Purina uses foodstuffs from China.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom and fur-mom

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food at first, and slowly began to not like it. After reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot fully digest corn as they are carnivores. Corn it is just a cheap filler that can cause dogs to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality pet foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value.The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging if the product does not contain the pictured items; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store.

review/text: Kudos to Purina for coming up with a superb quality bag for their Original Dog food.The zip-close on the bag is immensely useful for keeping the food fresh and moist. We have three dogs, they are all quite finicky eaters (i.e. spoilt!) and are known to turn their nose up at some quality brands, they did not exactly rush to this, but they did eat it all which is a big plus, because dog food is just not cheap anymore.<br />One of our dogs tends to shed a lot of hair with some of the cheaper brands, she did not do this with this product.<br /><br />A small tip, I saved the bag and re-used it for another Purina and non-Purina product and it saved both from drying up and becoming stale!<br />In my opinion it is a well balanced dog-food that the dogs will readily eat.

review/summary: My friend's 2 dogs and 5 shelter dogs ate this dog food eagerly
review/text: Since my friend is into rescue work, I figured this dog food would be great to test on her two dogs and the five shelter dogs she is working with.  All the dogs ate this food eagerly and they were not starving dogs.  I also decided to do a taste test with two dog foods; this food and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LANN56">Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food 4.5 Pound Bag</a> I was reviewing.  The one dog I tested it on sniffed both dog foods but chose to eat the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food  first.  However, he then finished off this food as well after devouring the other. So in the taste department I thinks it's pretty comparable.<br /><br />According to the packaging, PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food is 100% Complete and Balanced Nutrition with protein (beef), omega fatty acids and grains.  However, since I know dogs are carnivores I expected meat to be in at least one of the first four ingredients and they were not. The first four ingredients in order are ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour.  Beef happens to be seventh in the ingredients list.<br /><br />Each serving contains:<br />Crude Protein 25%<br />Crude Fat 10%<br />Crude Fiber 4%<br />Moisture 14 %<br />Linoleic Acid 1.5%<br />Calcium 1.1 %<br />Iron 175 mg/kg<br />Selenium 0.2 mg/kg<br />Vitamin A 10,000 IU/kg<br />Vitamin E 100 IU/kg<br /><br />Overall, the dogs enjoyed this food.  However, even though the package states it meets 100% of their nutritional needs, based on the first four ingredients and the misleading protein (beef) statement on the packaging I was left wondering "Where's the Beef?"  For this reason I give the product four stars as I do not think this is a nutritional powerhouse.

review/text: I usually feed my dog kibbles and bits but I decided to give Purina a try and it went over very well with my dog. Normally she will only eat a little and then come back and do that on and off till the bowl is gone, with this dog food she stayed there and ate until the whole bowl was gone. It is an obvious favorite for her and we will be changing what food we purchase for her from here on out!

review/text: Selecting a pet food is a complicated process.  It's no longer a case of `will my dog eat this?'  Nor even, `is it a well-balanced diet?'  Instead, for many of us, it has become a case of worrying about the safety of the food we offer our pets.<br /><br />Purina Beneful Original Dog Food does offer a balanced diet that fulfills the nutritional requirements of a healthy dog.  Below the are oft-cited ingredients in Beneful and those in Hill's Science Diet, my dog's usual nosh.<br /><br />Beneful:  Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, sorbitol, tricalcium phosphate, water, animal digest, salt, phosphoric acid, potassium chloride, dicalcium phosphate, sorbic acid (a preservative), l-lysine monohydrochloride, dried peas, dried carrots, calcium carbonate, calcium propionate (s preservative), choline chloride, vitamin supplements (E, A, B12, D3),<br /><br />Hills:  Chicken, Whole Grain Corn, Whole Grain Sorghum, Whole Grain Wheat, Chicken By-Product Meal, Soybean Meal, Corn Gluten Meal, Animal Fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols and citric acid), Brewers Rice, Chicken Liver Flavor, Lactic Acid, Soybean Oil, Flaxseed, Iodized Salt, Potassium Chloride, Choline Chloride, Vitamin E Supplement, L-Lysine, vitamins (L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), Vitamin E Supplement, Niacin, Thiamine Mononitrate, Vitamin A Supplement, Calcium Pantothenate, Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Riboflavin, Folic Acid, Vitamin D3 Supplement), Calcium Carbonate, minerals (Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Oxide, Copper Sulfate, Manganous Oxide, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, preserved with Mixed Tocopherols and Citric Acid, Phosphoric Acid, Beta-Carotene, Rosemary Extract.<br /><br />Do all these ingredients in either brand come from the United States?  Not so far as I can tell.  I can't find information anywhere on the package that says where the ingredients are from.  Does this make me uncomfortable?  Yes, it does.  But there are few affordable dog foods that give this information.<br /><br />My dog likes the taste of Beneful better than the Hill's (I`m not sure that tells us anything; he thinks old shoes taste great). And I know that he's getting a balanced diet when he eats any Purina food, whether or not meat is the first listed ingredient, and whether or not it contains corn (which he digests quite well).<br /><br />But I'm far more interested in learning the country of origin of the ingredients than in seeing the list.<br /><br />I'm giving Beneful four stars because it does what it claims - it gives my dog a balanced diet.  But I'm deducting one star because I want more information than I'm getting.

review/summary: The ONLY dog food our dog will eat!
review/text: Our dog Molly is a VERY picky eater. And folks, the absolute truth is she will ONLY eat this particular brand and flavor of dog food.  Now, whether or not that means it is good stuff is a highly subjective thing.  Since the humans here at home don't consume it, we can only go by Molly's ( a small cocker) enthusiasm for it and the fact she will refuse to eat ANY other type of food, both canned or dry. (she does, however, love Beggin' Strips)<br /><br />Now I have seen and read many reviews that proclaim this dog food as one of the very worst you can buy and for numerous reasons. The bottom line for me is our dog Molly has reached 14 years of age and is in reasonably good health, other than some arthritis, a bit of incontinence and being deaf. Whether that is because of this food or IN SPITE OF IT is beyond my knowledge.<br /><br />Basically, our dog loves this stuff, turns her nose up at ANYTHING else (except Beggin' Strips) and has reached the ripe old age of 14 and still chases me all over the house.  While I am sure you could find many people on both sides of the "This stuff is great" / "This stuff is garbage" issue, I can only tell you what we have experienced and how much our dog loves Purina Beneful.

review/summary: Good dog food
review/text: I honestly am not one who gives our dogs only gourmet/health food products and have always purchased grocery store brands. We feed our dogs several different kinds of food and treats (including some human food) and they've always been very healthy.  So, I guess what I'm saying is that I can't make any claims as far as how healthy this food is for your dogs, but I know our dogs are in great shape. We've used several Beneful products and our pets have always liked them. I've always found them to be very fresh and looking exactly like what is on the packaging.<br /><br />The Original Beneful looks exactly like it does on the outside of the bag.  The size of the pieces vary from approx. 1/2" to 3/4" and are in different shapes and colors.  The smell when you open the bag is a very strong dog food smell, so I would imagine it's very flavorful.  The zip top is very convenient to have on a bag this size.  You just press on the bag to get the air out and zip it shut.<br /><br />This bag is very large, so if you aren't sure if your dogs will like it you might want to try a smaller size at the grocery store first, but if you know your dogs like this, I don't think you can go wrong with it.

The food doesn't appear to be as smelly as some other foods are.  Since we have never purchased the product, I am not sure as to how competitively priced Beneful may be compared to other products.<br /><br />So far, Beneful seems to be okay.  I am not an expert on dog food, but some reviewers have expressed reservations about some of the supposedly less healthy ingredients. Based on that and if the price appears to be higher than similar products, we may not regularly purchase the product.

review/summary: our little shih tzu liked it just fine
review/text: What a treat to find a big bag of dog food waiting on the front porch, rather than having to schlep to the pet store and haul home!  Other than commenting on the convenience of home deliver, it's difficult to know what to say about a dog food --as I'm not going to taste it, and even if I did, I'm not sure that would provide any useful information.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The bits of kibble are colorful and attractive -- again, don't know if the dog cares about this one way or another -- but it looked appealing to me.<br /><br />-Some of the pieces seem to be a little soft & chewy, to provide variety and texture.  And the dog seems to like it.<br /><br />-I liked the packaging -- the bag has an easy-to-use zip top and easily sits upright.  It is sturdy and plasticized.<br /><br />-It was nice to have the large bag delivered to the door, rather than having to schlep it home from the pet store -- but I expect that convenience comes at a price!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Not sure this is the most nutritious food on the market, but I suspect it's perfectly serviceable.<br /><br />Overall, the dog seems to like it just fine, it is convenient to use, and I would likely try it again.

review/summary: The Dog Likes It But Ingredients Aren't the Best
review/text: 3.5 out of 5 stars.<br />I offered my dog equal amounts of her normal dry kibble, a popular mainstream brand, and Beneful.  She sniffed them both, then headed for the Beneful.  I tried to head her off by offering her the old food again, but she nosed that bowl away and tried to get to the Beneful.  She ate it quickly and with great enthusiasm.  Since then, she has happily eaten it even without added water or canned food (breakfast) that she usually gets.<br /><br />I have talked to a veterinarian who said that Beneful is a perfectly acceptable food for dogs.  Given that, I still am not impressed that the first ingredient is ground yellow corn and the second is chicken by-product meal.  For dog foods that don't have meat as a primary ingredient, I would rather see a higher protein vegetable source.  It also has something called "animal digest."  How appetizing does that sound?  I do like that it contains dried peas and dried carrots but those ingredients are pretty far down on the list.<br /><br />So, thumbs up for the apparent taste and appeal to my dog.  But a thumbs down for ingredients, although the list is better than some foods.  (That same vet told me that feeding a dog a specific brand of the popular economy foods would be no better than feeding her the bag it came in.)<br /><br />Overall, this isn't the worst food in the world but could be better.

review/text: I'm not a dog nutritionist.  My dogs have always eaten whatever my kids have dropped on the floor and they have always had long, healthy lives.  My dog won't pick Beneful over human food, but seems to like it enough to eat it regularly.  The kibble size is small enough for a small dog to handle (our dog is about 10 pounds).  If I have a bigger dog, I will usually buy something crunchier and larger than this, but I'm not sure that makes a difference.  If you don't want to spend a hundred bucks a month to feed a small dog, Beneful is a pretty good choice.

review/text: Let me just say for the record that there are worse products on the market for dogs than Purine Benful. While there is a lot of filler in Beneful--it may tell you something that the main ingredients are cornmeal and a chicken by product--it does provide dogs protein. The dog in my life did seem to like it but there are healthier products on the market.<br /><br />While the bag is sturdy and resealable, I did not have a pleasant experience with Amazon's delivery which lowers my score. Amazon sent the dog food via UPS ground and the box was literally in pieces. It was disappointing to say the least.

She LOVES Chef Michaels so much we give it to her as aa treat, BUT when put side by side with Beneful she went for the Beneful every time.  He did it about 6 times, each time changing position of the Beneful.  As I said, she is elderly and eating is one of her last joys in life, so I guess we'll be switching to Beneful now.  Gotta keep the little girl happy.  Thanks Purina for making a food we can feel good about feeding her and that she loves.

My Lab is also a fan, but that doesn't really mean much since he think leaves and rocks are fine dining.

So I will provide you instead with some facts about our (me and my dogs) experience with Beneful.<br /><br />The food is very colorful. I'm not sure why, because aren't dogs colorblind? I'm assuming it's so human pet owners will think it tastes better because it looks so over-saturated. I didn't taste the food. I'm really hoping that didn't violate my contract with the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />We have 3 dogs of various sizes. They all ate it. They didn't die or get sick. They didn't refuse to eat it. The smallest dog did have a little bit of trouble with the size of the nuggets.<br /><br />After asking them what they thought about the food a couple times and getting no discernible response I thought it was only fair to give the food 3 stars.

review/summary: Not something i'd use again
review/text: This Beneful is a rather confusing or misleading product. The company wants you to think this food is healthy for your pet. The reality is though that it is nothing other than a bag of grain and fillers. Sure, many dogs may like it and eat it, but it is not exactly nutritious for them.<br /><br />My dog didn't seem to mind it too much. He didn't seem overly excited by it, but he did eat it. He poked around at it a bit though beforehand.<br /><br />He did have much softer, lighter colored stools too, and went to the bathroom more often. The stools did not look like "healthy" stools. It was more like a step or two away from diarhea. I hate to sound gross here, but it is important to mention.<br /><br />The bag does clearly depict corn and veggies right on the picture on the front, so I guess it should be no real surprise, but it just seems like Purina was almost trying to pull as fast one on the consumer - make the food sound/look healthy and beneficial even though it is no better than the cheapest generic bag you could possibly find. Also, notice how the picture of the ear of corn is so prominent in comparison to the other items - it is because this dog food is mainly corn, as is with most all cheap/generic brands.<br /><br />For some, this may be suitable, but it is not something that I want my dog to eat regularly. I mean, if I was really super tight on cash, and my dog was out of food and Beneful was dirt cheap, clearanced, on sale etc - sure I might grab it to use for a day or two until I could buy him a bag of real food... but as for buying it regularly for daily consumption, it would never happen. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either unless your vet specifically tells you that your dog needs a corn and grain filled diet because of some serious health issue or something. I've never heard of that happening, but I guess anything is possible.<br /><br />I did give Beneful 3 stars simply because my dog did eat it, so it must not have tasted too terribly bad.

review/summary: PURINA Brand Beneful - Decent Product & Our Dog LOVES IT!
review/text: We have a 7 lb. chiweenie that eats anything. When I first received the bag I mixed it in with some of the regular brand I buy (Pedigree or Purina Dog Chow).  He ate all the "NEW" food and left the old.  The food is a bit moist, which I think my dog likes over the other two foods mentioned above.  It also "SMELLS" better than the other two foods. However, the top ingredients are corn based and by-products, but you get what you pay for.  I disagree that the packaging is somehow "misleading".  Read the ingredients on ANYTHING you are interested in BEFORE buying.  I LOVED the heavy duty plastic zip top bag that the food comes in also!  VERY HANDY, especially for storage.<br /><br />All in all, I will more than likely buy Beneful again for our pup!

All the whiners claim that such-and-such is too corm or soy heavy, or that it is not gluten free or some other such crap. Guess what...It's DOG FOOD! For the love of all that is holy would you tools quit your whine-fest and go away! For the record, this product did exactly what it was supposed to do. Do you know what that is? It fed my dogs. Furthermore, they all seemed to enjoy it and have not shown any ill effects or digestive ailments (Not a single degree higher on the dog-fart scale, so I am happy). Sure our dogs are our babies, but the same people who cry about dog food ingredients are the same ones who took the score out of childrens' sports and think everyone is a winner. Total and complete imbeciles.  Beneful Dog Food by Purina will always be welcome in my home. It hits a proper price point that others seem unable to reach.  Our pets are only given a short time with us on this planet, so why not let them enjoy their little lives to the fullest. Give them what they want. If this dog food makes them wag their happy little tails, then have at it. I found this to be a great product and I hope you do to. The naysayers need to get a grip on reality or just raise children instead. They don't deserve dogs! Recommended!

review/summary: Our doggy likes it!
review/text: Yes!  Score!  Our very picky dog likes this food!<br /><br />I thought all dogs just ate anything in front of them.  Nope, not our dog.  She's soooooo picky.  I've tried dog food after dog food and most of it has gone to my friends as our dog was just not interested.  Or, if she liked it at first bite, she soon turned away from it within a matter of days.  I've tried everything from the very expensive 'natural' dog food to food from the vet, to chewy and soft food, to little tiny food (she's a small dog) to canned dog food.  She's just picky, picky, picky.<br /><br />I think she likes Beneful because it has some crunchy bits and some soft and chewy bits.  Plus, it must taste good or she wouldn't eat it.<br /><br />Um, our cats like to nibble at this, too.  I guess they like the different textures and taste, too.  I thought CATS were supposed to be picky?  :)

review/summary: Yum
review/text: I have tried numerous dog food brands as my dogs often get (what I assume is ) bored with their food.  This one seemed like a hit.  They've eaten it consistently and lick their bowls clean - a rarity for my picky eaters.

review/summary: My dogs LOVE Beneful
review/text: My main concern when I requested this product was thinking it would be more suitable for bigger dogs. Considering I have small dogs, including Chihuahuas and Dachshunds, I was unsure they'd like or eat it. However, Beneful consisted of small, bite size chunks that were chewy. My dogs love this dog food so much, we've already went through the large bag and have had to buy another. In other words, my dogs have requested I switch their food. We're a Beneful family now. If you're curious if your dog will like this product, they do make smaller bags. However, we're sticking with the large bag because they chow it down. It's good because my Chihuahuas were a bit on the thin side, and though we moderate their food intake, they have gained slightly in weight, filling them out to a ore healthy weight as suggested by our Veterinarian.

review/summary: An OK product, dogs liked it, resealable bag
review/text: Our dog gave Beneful a try.  The label says whole wheat grains, real beef, accented with vitamin rich veggies, with moist chewy chunks.  I liked the quick zip for freshness zip lock top.  That was a nice feature for such a big bag that took some time to get through.  I also liked the photo of the food on the front to give me an idea of what to expect inside.  The moist chewy chunks look a bit like play-dough but our dog didn't seem to mind.  There were plenty of dry chunks, which I prefer to feed our dogs so they have something to work on keeping their teeth clean.<br /><br />When I fed it to our basset hound, she lost weight and her coat got kind of dull.  I mixed it in with her current food for the transition, but when I noticed her weight loss, ended up feeding her an extra cup more each day to compensate.  Her coat got better eventually and overall looks pretty good now.  She seemed to enjoy the food and had no trouble finishing her meals.  There were no intestinal issues during the transition which has troubled her during other food samplings. Overall, with the increased amount of food given, we thought it was an ok product.

review/summary: Ok dog food but mostly corn meal
review/text: Although my dog will eat this, I doubt I would buy it again, I try to avoid cornmeal as much as possible and that is the first ingredient.

review/summary: how to judge a dog food?
review/text: I have to admit it's hard to review a product I don't personally use but I can say that our dog seems to like Beneful. She eats her serving all at once. The food itself looks pretty in the bowl with multiple colors (two shades of brown, red and green) in different shapes.

review/summary: Dogs Love Beneful
review/text: I have three little dogs, two of them that are a bit picky. They've always liked Beneful and I'm happy with feeding it to them. We have moved to making almost all of their food for better health and we use Beneful as a filler and supplement to it.
