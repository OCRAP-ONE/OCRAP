review/summary: Best vinegar I've ever used!
review/text: I make lots of homemade salad dressings.  When the recipe calls for wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar, I use this Chianti Red Wine Vinegar. Most wine vinegar is either too sharp or watery.  Most balsamic vinegar is too sweet for my taste.  I have been using this particular brand for years.  The most reliable source is through Amazon.com. I hope Dal Raccoloto never stops making this stuff!

review/summary: Quite a Tasty Tandoori
review/text: I used this product to create Tandoori chiken - which I marinated in yoghurt and this paste, and then cooked it on the barbeque for maximum flavour. I have always used Sharwoods Medium Tandoori Paste, however I could not find this product in the USA.  I tried Pataks Tandoori paste, and it was nice, but definitely not as good as the Sharwoods Paste or the Sharwoods Tandoori Curry Powder.<br /><br />Use Pataks if you cant find the Sharwoods equivalent.<br />Craig from Melbourne, Australia.

Complaining that there's artificial coloring or quibbling that the color is too orange???  Get real!  Someone says it doesn't have the "classic" flavor.  That's utter rubbish!  Unless you have your own Tandoori oven, you can only make Tandoori with marinades like this.  Just add this to your yogurt base.  It's easy, delicious and authentic.  Of course it gets 5 stars!

review/summary: Difficult to use in colder seasons
review/text: I love coconut....so thought I would love Manna.  However, I don't eat bread because of gluten issues, and Nutiva recommends spreading this on toast as a replacement for butter or cream cheese, so this wouldn't work for me, but I'm sure it would taste wonderful.  I do like smoothies and oatmeal,  and I also saw the recipe for manna icing on the Nutiva website so wanted to try that.  I love coconut oil and use it in many things...<br /><br />However, the Manna smells heavenly and acts just like coconut oil as it solidifies at certain temps. It came in the mail solidified.  I live at the southern edge of Indiana so it's cool here now.  I noticed on the label it says the oil rises to the top...well when I tried to measure out a 1/2 cup, I was having to take it out in chunks but then  I noticed that parts of it was a darker color, so I figured I was getting all oil so I let the whole jar sit in hot water so that I could blend it before removing the amount I needed.  Nutiva says to let it sit in hot tap water 5 to 10 mins.  I had it immersed in water for 20 mins and it's still hard as a rock.  Already,  this is a pain.  So unless you live in a house that is above 73 degrees, you will have same problem..I can't just take out a scoop and add to my oatmeal or smoothie if the oil rises to the top and separates when it hardens so this is a seasonal product for me because my house temps are on the cool side.

review/summary: Gritty, oily and yukky taste!
review/text: I have been making coconut oil smoothies using canned coconut milk and fruit and then adding a tablespoon of pure coconut oil.  I thought it would be better to use the Coconut Manna since the oil is already in it.  First I tried tasting it from a spoon (after mixing it thoroughly).  It was very gritty, very oily, and didn't have a fresh coconut taste.  It was like eating really oily, gritty peanut butter, but didn't taste as good as peanut butter.  Then I mixed it in a smoothie and it was still very gritty and so thick and "oily" tasting I threw out the smoothie without finishing it.  One of these days I will try coconut cream from another company -- maybe it will taste better and won't be so gritty.

review/text: This stuff really tastes great. It made of coconut oil mixed with liquified coconut "meat". In warm weather you just shake it to mix it up and pour it on. But in cold weather the heavier whitish-colored meat will harden underneath  with the clear coconut oil on top of it.<br />I scoop a couple of spoonfuls onto my Ezekiel sprouted-grain pasta with fresh-pressed garlic and also use it on top of my salads.<br /><br />If you love the unique flavor of coconut then you should give this product a try.

review/summary: Don't get the point
review/text: I really wish there were more recipes as to what to do with this product. The coconut tastes like what happens when you open a fresh coconut and eat out the meat. Only it's put in a jar. It's not the milk so you can't really cook food in it or drink it. It's not the processed candy version so beloved of ice cream and sprinkles. Instead its fairly raw and tasteless. The jar seems to indicate that its a spread so am I supposed to put this on toast?<br /><br />I'm sure that there will be a use for this food stuff somehow but as it stands, I'm not sure of the point.

review/summary: wonderful on bread
review/text: Both me and my husband love the manna as a spread on a homemade bread, it is delicious. It smells very much of coconut, and at first you expect it to be sweet, but it is not, well, almost. There is some sweetness to it. It does not leave that greasy feeling in your mouth as if you ate some lard, although it surely does look like it.<br />It was not too easy to spread on soft bread at room temperature (we keep rooms about 72F) and keeping it in hot water didn't work, since the outside melted, but the core was still hard. I simply cut thin slices of it and put on my bread.<br />Kids were brave enough to try it, but didn't really like manna. Probably because it smells so deceiving of being sweet. Only our two-year old asked for the second bite.<br />I didn't try to cook with it yet.<br />I think it is great nutritious alternative to regular butter, though an acquired taste.

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: To me this tastes really, really good.  It was sort of a pain to blend the oil with the solids though..  I tried twice placing the plastic jar in hot water as per the directions but it didn't help.  I ended up transferring the contents to a larger glass container and breaking up the solids and blending by hand.  Once mixed it remained mixed but I assume it would separate again eventually if left undisturbed for a long time, something that will not be happening in my case. If refrigerated it turns rock hard and stays that way for many hours.  I've had mine in the 'fridge the past few days to make it less accessible because it's very tempting and I find myself sampling it with alarming frequency.  The taste is so fresh it took me back to growing up in south Florida in the fifties and having all the coconut we cared to pry out of their thick hulls.  I've used this coconut manna (a very fitting name) spread on cornbread and also on warm roasted vegetables - both extremely tasty.  I also made a small batch of pie crust dough using this product instead of butter, pressed it flat and baked it and that was good too.  I plan to make a Thanksgiving pumpkin pie in a coconut manna crust this year.  That is if I can keep from eating it all up in the next few weeks.  Update - coupla' uses found since I wrote this:  added in when making a batch of nut butter and also went very well in a mug of hot coffee with soy milk added (a splash of brandy makes it eve better).

review/summary: My new most favorite coconut oil
review/text: Wow, when Amazon offered this to me to review in their Vine review program I jumped at the chance since I love coconut oil, and so does my dog.<br />I just received this in the mail and I opened it immediately.  This is now my new favorite, not only is this organic but it is non GMO with zero trans fats. The company donates 1% of its sales to sustainable agriculture, hooray for them.<br />It has a web site that you can go to for recipes and ideas on how to use this product.<br />If you are not familiar with coconut oil here is the scoop basically.  In the cool whether it remains hard, it melts very quickly to a smooth liquid when heated.  In the summer is is always liquid, but if you keep it in the fridge it will solidify.  Just scoop some out for smoothies and sauces and to add a bit of flavor to cookies etc. The best way to use this you must make it liquid so you have to sit it in a bowl of hot water, be sure not to get water into the jar.  Stir it up somewhat to distribute the solids and oil and spoon out an enjoy.<br />This Nutiva product is very smooth and melts in your mouth as it states on the label.  It has a very distinct flavor of coconut, not always present in all oils of this kind.  This is very refreshing to me.<br />Coconut oil is excellent for your pooch but must be introduced very slowly by spoon over a long period as not to upset their stomach.  It helps with allergies and yeast infections. Start with 1/4 tsp. and work up to about 2 tsp. in a few weeks.  I just gave my dog a taste and he went nuts, he was jumping up on me for more, just amazing, this is a huge reaction that I do not get from the other brands.<br />This oil can be blended in smoothies and cereals for added flavor.<br />You get 2 15 oz. jars so the price is right, you get free shipping for over $25.00 which makes this an even better deal with just a small added purchase.<br />I give this a thumbs up.

review/summary: gritty and easy to choke on raw but great for baking, 2nd jar better
review/text: I am a HUGE fan of Nutiva coconut oil, I use it in and on everything from Sambal Shrimp to smoothies, it's amazing. I was very excited to try this spreadable product. When it arrives it is like natural peanut butter only harder to mix. It was like hardening cement in oil. I had to pry it lose with a fork and it was difficult to blend even after soaking the jar in hot water. Finally I used my hand blender stick right in the jar and it whipped up creamy but struggled binding the motor a bit. I first tasted it on a spoon and it plastered itself to the inside of my mouth and tongue to where it was difficult to even swallow, a very disconcerting experience I wasn't expecting. While it blended creamy it is very gritty and choky and really doesn't taste all that great actually the oil tastes much better. If you have any choking issues which I usually don't, this is not for you. OK, so it's not good straight out of the jar, lets try a smoothie. I added this to my usual smoothie using frozen banana and plain whey protein powder and water with a touch of honey. It tasted good that way and blended well but I still found myself really choking on the grit. I like the oil much better even in my smoothie this product just sticks in your throat really bad. I would not buy this but I would highly recommend the oil by this company, it is very fine natural Coconut oil.<br /><br />I later upped my review from 2 stars to 3 stars. I have kept on trying to find a good use for this product and found it is much better when added to something baked. I made my usual sweet cornbread and added a heaping tablespoon of this manna as well as substituting the butter for their coconut oil and the results were truly divine! I still don't like the way you have to constantly keep remixing it and I still don't like this stuff straight out of the jar or in a smoothie but it is wonderful for baking.<br /><br />12/27/11 Update:<br />This product came as two jars packaged together. This week I opened the second jar and was surprised to find it was much different then the first jar. This jar mixed much easier and was much creamier. The first jar was so hardened I had to pry on it with a steak knife. I live in south Florida, cold temperatures are never an issue, my coconut oil is always liquid. I again tried it straight and this time it did not plaster itself to my mouth and was not gritty like the first jar. It tasted better too. Not sure why this jar was such a different experience from the first jar, especially since they were packaged together. Based on the second jar experience I would try this again, I've been finding more and more uses for it. If I had only received the first jar I would not consider trying it again. Strange there are such inconsistencies with this product.<br /><br />2/3/12 Update:<br />I ordered this again because the second jar was really good unlike the first jar. I am happy to report back that jar 3 and 4 were perfect. They were very easy to mix, very smooth and creamy and not easy to choke on like the first jar. In fact it was great right out of the jar this time. So, I'm not sure what was wrong with the first jar, maybe just old but since then every jar has been just fine and really good quality. Based on the last three jars I changed my review from 3 stars to 4. I hope there are no more inconsistency issues in the future because I really like this product. Three out of four jars were great anyway.

review/summary: "We only have one jar left."
review/text: So muttered my sister as I was telling a friend I had two jars of Nutiva's Coconut Manna. Absurdly delicious, this wonderful food is distinctly different from other coconut products and a delightful substitute for butter and/or cream.<br /><br />Made from the entire edible portion of the coconut and not just the oil, coconut manna naturally contains beneficial fiber, minerals, and essential fatty acids. Creamy in texture with just a touch of natural sweetness, it works as a spread on toast and is heavenly mixed with oatmeal. As noted in other reviews, the manna solidifies at room temperature and needs to be softened and mixed before using. If you skip this step, you will end up with the oil separating to the top of the jar and the more fibrous part collecting in the middle. Not exactly a bad thing per se, but it is better completely mixed.<br /><br />The only downside to coconut manna is the high amount of saturated fat. The saturated fat in coconut has a strange structure: the fatty acids are medium chain, instead of long or short chain. What this means in practical terms is that your body has to heat up to burn off the medium chain triglycerides (or MCTs), leading some to claim weight loss benefits. The science on this so far is mixed, but too much saturated fat is never a great thing for anybody. So, everything in moderation, and no eating the whole jar in one sitting. Unless you have to.<br /><br />GRADE: A

review/text: This seems to be about the same as the Tropical Traditions Coconut Cream Concentrate, which I also love.  I think they are equally good.  In the past I've had to wait a long time for TT to have a sale then buy 4 2lb. jars because of the high shipping, so I'm very happy to see this available for less than TT regular price in smaller quantities with no shipping cost if Prime or over $25 order.<br />TT has plenty of recipes on their website. Actually I often just eat it with a spoon!<br />The oil and solids tend to separate so I had to warm the jar and stir it up, then cool it and  it stayed mixed.  FYI the melting point of coconut oil is 76 degrees, the solids seem to need a little warmer than that to mix up.<br />And don't worry, natural saturated fats are actually *good* for you.

review/summary: The New Butter
review/text: I had used product by this manufacturer before.  I used their coconut oil for frying and seasoning foods that I wanted to have a tropical, underlying coconut, island flavor.  It had worked well for me and the numerous benefits of using coconut products are far too extensive to list in this review.  The overlying theme that I found when doing my research was to go "organic" so that no chemicals were used to strip the coconut oil from the inedible shell.  I was so thrilled with the coconut oil that I just had to try the new "manna" product and I am so glad that I did.<br /><br />This is a thick, flavorful spread at room temperature and I found it easy to put on fresh baked bread, corn on the cob, steamed broccoli, chicken breasts.... you name it, the list is endless.  It is wonderful and I do not think that I will be able to be without it in my kitchen.  The flavor is subtle, the texture is easily spreadable and the taste is going to transport your everyday foods to a new level.  I have really enjoyed Coconut Manna.

That's 30 minutes with boiling tap water running into a small bowl where the Coconut Manna was immersed.<br /><br />I'm not sure what use we'll find for this, but I don't see the sense of liquefying it every time I want to spread a little on toast.<br /><br />MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.

review/summary: Read how to use this product. Let me share this valuable info on this product!
review/text: I have been using Tropical Tradition Coconut Oil for years, primarily for saut&eacute;ing and home-made granola. I had never heard of Coconut Manna and was not quite sure what it was, but it sounded interesting to try it out.<br /><br /> MY EXPERIENCE: When I received it I wasn't quite sure what to think. It was very solid and obviously had melted, then re-solidified on its side. In addition, I could see there were 2 layers of different colors that had separated. The dark layer tasted pretty darn good and the lighter layer was oily. I was able to get on Nutiva's web site and get their 800-993-4367 x2 number and they had a very helpful guy on the phone that helped me understand the product. Let me share this with you:<br /><br />ABOUT THE PRODUCT: It is a whole-food product, meaning it is 100% coconut with very little processing. The difference between this and coconut oil is that coconut oil is put through a cold expresser process to get the oil out. Both are fresh-harvest coconuts that are dried, but the Manna is ground into a very fine powder right after drying. Then, they add some of their coconut oil (that's the light colored separate layer I saw when I opened my jar of Manna). In addition, Manna is lower in calories than coconut oil.<br /><br />PLEASE READ FOR CORRECT USE OF THE PRODUCT: According to the Nutiva guy on the phone, you really need to soften the product and mix thoroughly to truly appreciate the full spectrum of this amazing product. When I followed his instructions, I can assure you that this is an absolutely WONDERFUL coconut product!!!! It must be softened by achieving a temperature above 76 degrees and then mixed thoroughly. If you live in a warm climate, you won't have to worry about softening, but for my cool Oregon climate I need to soften before use. There were a couple suggestions the Nutiva guy had to soften the product, plus I've added my own recommendation listed on item #3:<br /><br />1. Run tap water to the very hottest setting, then fill a bowl and put the Manna container in the bowl for 10-15 minutes. After that time mix well before serving. (From my experiment, you need to refill with hot water several times and it takes more like 30-60 minutes to achieve softness.)<br /><br />2. Better way is if you have a gas oven. Place the Manna container in the oven without turning it on. With just the gas pilot, it will warm enough to soften the Manna, and then mix well before serving. You can actually store it in your gas oven, just remember to remove before turning the oven on or you'll have a disaster on your hands.<br /><br />3. If you have a food dehydrator, open the lid of the Manna container and put it in the dehydrator on a very low setting higher than 76 and below 100. After 15 minutes, stir the Manna, and then put back in for another 15 minutes, then mix well before serving.<br /><br />I absolutely love the taste and texture of this product and could eat it right out of the container. It's wonderful on crackers, sweets, or bread and adds a lovely taste to my green smoothies. This will not replace my regular coconut oil for saut&eacute;ing, but is a nice "special treat" that is both healthy and delicious.  I tried saut&eacute;ing in Manna, with mixed results: it tends to turn brown and add a burned flavor.<br /><br />MOST IMPORTANTLY: I would really like it if the product was distributed in glass rather than plastic. In my opinion, heating and eating products in plastic containers is questionable and I believe detrimental to this planet and our health. PLEASE Nutiva, switch over to glass containers!!! I will reuse the glass containers and it is the `right' thing to do for your customers. I have purchased coconut oil for years from Tropical Traditions web site and their pricing is comparable to yours, except they distribute in glass containers.<br /><br />HERE'S MY EVALUTATION ON NUTIVA'S PRICES VS. TROPICAL TRADITION:<br /><br />Tropical Tradition:<br />"Gold Label Virgin Coconut Oil" IN GLASS CONTAINER 16 oz. buy one and get one free on their web site: $19.95 for two. Approx. $10 for shipping = $15 ($1 less than Nutiva's)<br />Uses glass jars!!!<br /><br />Nutiva Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil:<br />15 oz. $16 with free shipping on orders over $30 on Nutiva's web site<br />15 oz. $10 Coconut Manna<br />On Amazon:  $18.80 (retail $22) for 2 with free shipping over $25.

review/summary: Not Happy With This Product
review/text: I absolutely love Nutiva's coconut oil and so I thought I would love their Coconut Manna as well. Unfortunately that is not the case.<br /><br />I followed the directions on the container to soften the product so that I could mix the oil back into the coconut. I ended up using an immersion blender to thoroughly mix it which worked very well.<br /><br />I find it almost inedible. The texture is gritty and very thick. It sticks to the inside of my mouth and leaves an unpleasant dry sensation. It doesn't "melt" in my mouth as described on the container. I don't enjoy the taste either. The pure taste of coconut oil is there, but with another taste mixed in that ruins it and leaves an aftertaste.<br /><br />I'm really disappointed. I'm planning on trying another brand of coconut butter and see if it's a problem with the Nutiva brand or just my own taste/texture preferences. It's not anywhere near the expiration date, it doesn't taste rancid and the container was properly sealed, so I assume that the product is fresh.<br /><br />Update: 2-13-2012 - I purchased some Artisana organic raw coconut butter and compared the two. I have to say that I like the Artisana brand better. It's smoother and the color is lighter. It's also packaged in a glass jar which I prefer. The taste is also somewhat better. I now know that I don't really like coconut butter, it's just not for me. I would recommend that if you buy coconut butter buy the Artisana brand.

review/text: I enjoy Coconut Manna very much.  I  add it to my oatmeal instead of sugar or maple syrup or have a teaspoon of it plain and it satisfies my sweet tooth without any sugar.  And its not really very sweet, but it is very rich with a natural coconut flavor.  The only thing that I dislike about it is the need to soften it by sitting it in hot water (you are not supposed to microwave it - and I don't do that anyway since microwaves are not terribly healthy).  It is also a little bit grainy, instead of being creamy, but that is something that I was easily able to adjust to.  All-in-all, a product that I will try to keep on hand in my kitchen.

review/summary: The manna is quite good, but what a royal pain to use - if you live in cold weather areas, order this in summer
review/text: Does it taste good? Yes. If you like the taste and texture of coconut butter, you will most certainly like this product.<br /><br />Does it spread nicely? Well, that depends on where you live and how patient you are. In cold weather this is a royal pain to use because the oil separates and hardens at temperatures below 76 F. The instructions on the label say to place the container in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes to soften the manna. Well, in my kitchen (room temperature  about 70 F) it took almost a half hour for this thing to melt.<br /><br />I placed the jar inside a stainless steel saucepan filled with hot water that must have been at least 180 F. After 5 minutes the water had cooled quite a bit and yet the oil had not even started to melt. I used a blunt knife to try and break the manna into pieces. Did the same thing two more times. Finally, the fourth water change did the trick and the manna now had acquired a nice consistency, perfect for spreading, but at that point I was not a very happy camper.<br /><br />I wanted to use this as a breakfast spread and that's not going to happen, at least not during the week. I just don't have the time nor the patience. It just takes too long.<br /><br />I buy natural organic peanut butter, which also must be mixed well for the oil to combine, but I only have to do that  once so I don't mind at all. With this manna it's an everyday event.<br /><br />I ordered two jars, one of them will live in my pantry until next summer, and we'll treat coconut manna as a warm weather food, I guess.<br /><br />This is a very nice tasting coconut product, which I would have rated 5 stars otherwise. Certainly worth a try, if you happen to keep your house above 75 F year round.

review/summary: Sinfully rich but oh so delicious!
review/text: Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna is certainly one of the most sinful of foods but, oh my gosh, is it delicious! It is a very rich but very flavorful coconut cream made from certified organic dried coconut meat from the Philippines. (I live in southwest Florida and room temperature here is just perfect for ensuring a very spreadable coconut cream).<br /><br />When I first opened the jar the fresh fragrance of coconut made my mouth water! Just like a kid, I could not resist sticking my finger into the jar and taking a big, generous taste. My taste buds simply exploded when the unique flavor of this decadent coconut cream melted on my tongue like sweet butter! And just like a kid, I know I will be tempted to take those sinful dips into the luscious coconut manna jar.<br /><br />I have noticed other reviewers' comments about the "grittiness" of this product and I just want to point out that coconut meat is a high fiber food and coconut manna is 100% whole coconut, so the texture is much like one should expect in a high fiber spread. Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna contains 12% fiber and 9% protein, whereas coconut oil contains none.<br /><br />Coconut in general is such a versatile food with an extraordinary taste and all manner of health benefits. In Sanskrit, the coconut palm is called "kalpa vriska" meaning "the tree that supplies all that is needed to live." But I must be frank...I do not think Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna or any coconut product should be used as a food therapy for any health purpose. Coconut meat is nearly all fat, 80% of which is saturated. With that said, as difficult as it will probably be, I will be using Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna only sparingly (but with utter enjoyment!)<br /><br />Being a raw vegan foodie and with the holidays quickly approaching, I do look forward to getting creative with Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna and devising culinary applications with it, such as in my raw, vegan spreads, soups, smoothies, sauces, cheeses, and especially in desserts. Of course I will have to consider it a celebration food because of the high saturated fat content. This luscious treat is not the best choice for health or waistline but it is so good to the palate! I will definitely be using Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna for special occasions, for entertaining and for those times of private indulgence when I need to treat myself... and I will do so with wild abandon!

review/text: Like another reviewer, I too use this to make paleo/primal chocolate bark (coconut oil, coconut manna, unsweetened cocoa, vanilla liquid stevia, crushed macadamias).  Before I found this product I was making my chocolate bark in a base of only coconut oil, but the addition of coconut manna completely transformed the recipe.  For me, the chocolate coconut bark went from being merely a tolerable way to ingest massive amounts of coconut oil to a confection that I dream about eating at all hours of the day.  I'm addicted.  And consequently, I'm pretty sure I've discovered the only way to get fat on the paleo diet.  But who cares? It's worth it.

review/summary: Analog to Coconut Cream or Coconut Butter, Wonderful Product
review/text: ****<br />This Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna is actually a type of coconut cream or coconut butter NOT coconut oil. The difference is that the cream or butter is much thicker, has whole coconut in it, and a very strong coconut flavor. You would not use the coconut manna for cooking. It is used more as a spread (which you wouldn't usually do with coconut oil) or can even be eaten by itself or made into a candy (because it is slightly sweet). It can be added to smoothies or used in many other creative ways. Think of it like whole coconut meat in a creamy form.<br /><br />The reason I did not give this coconut manna five stars is because it is packaged in a difficult way. First of all, the container is plastic. In order to use the coconut manna, the container must be heated gradually to a very warm room temperature (say 80 degrees, I'd think) or else put in hot water for 30 minutes, stirred, and left in hot water for 30 more minutes. This is very inconvenient, plus the plastic container is not good for all of the repeated heatings.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great product. It is very slightly sweet and tastes strongly like coconut. The consistency is a bit gritty or grainy due to part of the coconut flesh that is powder and has been reconstituted, but I found that fine, not off-putting at all. It's great all by itself, added to smoothies, or put into the freezer in molds for a whole foods raw candy.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: I like it, but you do have to put some work into it.
review/text: I love coconut.  I buy shredded coconut from Nuts Online all the time (they also stock mediterranean pine nuts (pignolias) if like me you don't want the ones coming from China).  I use finer shredded coconut in omelettes and cakes.  I use larger coconut chips to just eat!  When I need to use oil to cook, I nine out of ten times it will be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QDRJXY">pure, raw pressed coconut oil.</a>  I drink coconut water every single day with dinner!  (I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0R8I">Vita Coco</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CN7BMA">Zico</a>).  Coconut is a super-food!  It had been handed a bad rap over the years due to poor, agenda driven research and even poorer government recommendations, but in recent years coconut has been found to be one of the healthiest foods available.<br /><br />So what is Coconut Manna?  It's the name Nutiva calls this super coconut butter.  As a coconut lover, I never had coconut butter before.  So I still had no idea what to expect until I tried it.<br /><br />Apparently, it's pulverized pure coconut flesh, made into a creamy, buttery coconut spread that smells great and tastes even better!  Like pure coconut oil, Coconut Manna hardens at temperatures below 76 degrees fahrenheit and solidifies below 73 degrees.  However, unlike coconut oil, when the Manna solidifies, it separates into various layers of coconut oil and coconut flesh.  When I first opened it, it was a solid mass which had formed when the jar was on it's side.  In order to eat this properly, you need to heat it to liquify it and then stir it thoroughly to recombine it (kind of like natural peanut butter).  It takes some work, but it's worth it.  Basically you submerge the closed jar into a bowl of super hot tap water for 15 to 20 minutes and that should melt it enough to allow you to stir it.  It will take some work to stir it, but once stirred, spread it on bread or drizzle it on ice cream or just eat it right out of the jar!  If you are a coconut lover, you will almost definitely enjoy Coconut Manna!<br /><br />I like making coconut/cheese omelettes by beating shredded coconut into the eggs (about one tablespoon shredded coconut per egg).  Try it!  Using the Coconut Manna, I made a new dish where I substituted Coconut Manna for the cheese making a sweet/savory all coconut omelette!<br /><br />This is my own recipe - the coconut omelette:<br /><br />3 large eggs<br />3 heaping tablespoons of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YR7A9Q">unsweetened, shredded coconut</a><br />2-3 tablespoons of Coconut Manna (pre-heated and mixed)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UGMH9Y">some coconut palm sugar</a> (about a teaspoon)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QDRJXY">some coconut oil</a> (about a tablespoon)<br /><br />Beat the eggs, add the shredded coconut, then beat the mixture a little more until combined.  I use stainless steel to cook with over gas, so heat about a tablespoon of coconut oil in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005AL5D">a 10" stainless steel fry pan</a> (sized for 3 eggs).  Be sure to coat the pan well.  Get the pan hot, but not hot enough to smoke the oil - better to let it heat slowly over low to medium heat then to kill it on high heat.  Add the eggs/shredded coconut mixture.  Let the eggs slowly cook until the egg "pancake" breaks loose in the pan (don't try to force it).  Let the eggs slowly cook a little more until they start to "gel" a little towards the center.  Don't rush this because you do not want to burn the eggs but don't wait for them to fully cook either!  Now the tricky part, using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ND5CBG">very large spatula,</a> flip the egg "pancake" over.  Make sure the heat is on low at this point.  Spoon the Coconut Manna onto one half of the eggs.  Then sprinkle the coconut palm sugar onto the Manna.  Fold up the plain half of the eggs to create the classic omelette fold.  Plate it, maybe sprinkle a little sea salt on it, maybe sprinkle just a little more coconut palm sugar on top (for visual effect) and enjoy!  I usually have mine with some Trader Joe's Greek Style Honey Yogurt on the side.

review/summary: Yummy, but not sure what to do with it
review/text: Honestly, I haven't searched the Nutiva site for recipes, so I'm not sure what all the possible uses are for Coconut Manna. I will say that all by itself it tastes pretty yummy. I keep finding my 9-yr-ld daughter sneaking spoonfuls of it! So far we've spread it on toast and tried making smoothies with it. The smoothies didn't work too well because it solidified into little chunks that wouldn't blend and then got stuck in the straws. I can imagine it would be good to bake with, though.<br /><br />It's essentially pureed coconut. The consistency is dependent on the room temp, as coconut oil has a rather low melting point. When I first bought this, the weather--and hence our house--was pretty warm, and the consistency was that of oobleck. :D  But as the temp dropped, it became more solid.<br /><br />All in all, it's been good, but not sure I'd buy more only because I don't cook a lot. I thought this would be more something that could replace cream cheese and such for me as I'm allergic to milk, but it's not quite right for that. Still, it does taste good and I'm sure it's loaded with nutrients!

review/summary: Wasn't sure what to expect
review/text: If you have never tried coconut manna, you may be a little shocked. Texture is a bit like 'dry' peanut butter or almond butter. I thought that since coconut oil is very 'wet' (even though it is solid at room temperature) that it would give this that quality but I didn't find that to be the case. I purchased a two pack (very good deal, in my humble opinion) and it will last for quite a while.<br /><br />The flavor of this is good. It smells like coconut but the taste is not sweet per se and reminds me more of a nut butter (but without the 'sweetness'). It is unsweetened and consists only of organic whole coconut. You can find some recipes at nutiva.com but I didn't find them very helpful (unless you also are accustomed to purchasing hempseed and/or other ingredients). I have tried this with oatmeal a few times. Normally I eat oatmeal with only butter. On the jar it has a recipe for "Manna Oatmeal" but again, it includes hempseed -which I excluded. It made the oatmeal very very dry but it did add a pleasant taste to it.<br /><br />As with coconut oil, this is solid at room temperature. The container says it liquefies at above 73*. In our house it is generally in the 60s. I actually put it in the microwave for 30 second intervals until it was soft enough to stir together. Otherwise I use a spoon and scrape out what I need. When using it in my oatmeal, which is already hot, that works fine as it melts into the oatmeal but I wonder how well it'd work to spread it on toast when I wanted.<br /><br />I am interested to see how it can be used for other things (it says it can replace butter, cream cheese and cream in recipes). I wasn't sure to give this a 3 or 4 star rating because I've never tried it before by any other brand. I like it enough to possibly buy more in the future.

review/summary: A strange, but rewarding experience in the end.
review/text: I've had Artisana coconut butter before and it was solid from start to finish. To be fair I had it in the winter so it didn't get a chance to liquefy. It was bright white, had the somewhat gritty consistency of having ground up coconut flesh but as it warmed in my mouth it went smooth. So I ordered Nutiva because it was a better value for the price. It's August. It arrived warm in a tan liquid form with a hard to stir solid on the bottom. It was disgusting. After a little work stirring it all up it started to solidify to a syrup -- it would pour out if I tipped it. It was getting better at that point, though. A night in a cool cabinet and now it has reformed into a single layer light colored solid. It has grittiness to it but that's what the coconut's like. The flavor is good. I think Artisana had a marginally better flavor.

review/summary: Nice taste, satisfying but timely to use.
review/text: While this is an unusual product, it's a healthy substitute for many snacks.  Great on toast or added to a smoothie or just eaten out of the jar.  I would use more of it if it didn't take so long to melt.  You need to sit the container in hot water for about 15 minutes before you can mix and use each time as at room temperature it hardens and separates.  Tastes sort of like a mild coconut, butter, nutty flavor.  Hard to describe, but pleasant and apparently very healthy.

review/summary: Bask in the power of the coconut
review/text: Yeah, that sounds way out there to me too.  This is amazing stuff.  Its basically coconut thats been dried and ground, also known as coconut butter.  Its rich in fiber and protein, plus plenty of saturated coconut fat.  A number of studies suggest that coconut oils, rich in beneficial fatty acids, may actually be a heart healthy fat in low to moderate amounts.  People who eat coconut frequently around the world seem to have lower incidence of heart disease and certain cancers, and the main fats in coconut all have been demonstrated to have healthful effects, improving HDL and creating LDL thats smaller, harder, and less likely to plaque your arteries.  About 2 or 3 tablespoons of this per day and you've picked up a bit of those oils and some protein and fiber as well.  Plus it tastes really good and goes great in baked goods and candies.<br /><br />When you get it, put the jar in some warm water for a few minutes and the manna will liquify.  Stir thoroughly and it will become a solid again at room temperatures below 76 degrees.  When its a solid, you can scoop some out with a sharp spoon or a butter knife.  As a liquid, it pours.<br /><br />My wife found a recipe for a 'truffle' that incorporates this, cocoa powder, dates, chia seeds and hemp seeds, cinnamon and a few other ingredients.  Its like the best tasting energy bar you've ever had, and all of those ingredients are high in good plant fats, protein and fiber.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this stuff, do some research online and read everyones viewpoint.  I'm not sure about the science behind it but I'm sure that it tastes good and a little wont hurt you.  Coconut manna is the best tasting coconut butter I've tried, and the company has a good reputation for quality.  Try the coconut oil as well.  It works out really well in many dishes, having a sweet, slightly coconut aroma and taste.

review/summary: Less an oil than a "peanut butter" type of product -- delicious once softened & mixed!
review/text: If you are looking for a coconut oil product, this is not an oil.  There are differences.  The first review I read did a great job describing them and that reviewer talked to a company rep and provided all the info.  This is similar to "Coconut Butter," which I've purchased before and is available on Amazon(Artisana, Organic Raw Coconut Butter).  In fact, it's exactly the same.  I needed to blend both and the taste and texture were the same.  On that note, I also discovered Artisana Coconut Butter-Cacao Bliss.  Natural raw chocolatey, delicious!  Great spread on bread or just on a spoon!<br /><br />Anyhooooo...back on topic...<br /><br />In a mild CA climate, I found I needed to soften the Manna.  Placing in a deep bowl of hot tap water worked.  I put it in.  About 5 minutes later, I removed it and stirred a bit.  Got new hot water and repeated the wait and mix.  This combined it well and I had no need to heat it up again, as when it cooled, it didn't separate again.  I have used it in raw "baking" and also spread on bread or a cracker.<br /><br />As someone who enjoys the occasional real junk food(had Twix yesterday and a brownie at the in-laws house today), I still found the taste and texture good, just on its own.  It isn't sugary sweet, but as sweet as natural coconut, because that is what it is.<br /><br />It works great in thickening/helping hold together raw desserts.  I've used it in my cashew cream deserts as the creamy filling and also a combination of Manna and coconut oil with ground nuts and dates, for a crust.  As a raw foodie, I only dabble, but, once softened, it's easy to use.

review/summary: yummy addition to plain greek yogurt
review/text: I "melted" mine by putting the jar in a pan of hot water. When it was pourable, I dumped it in a bowl and used a potato masher to get it mixed really well.  I then put it in three widemouth glass jars.  Two jars went into the fridge, one jar is in the cupboard. Since it is winter here, the jar in the cupboard has not yet separated. When I prepare yogurt, I scrape bits of the hardened manna (from the refrigerated jar) into the yogurt, along with other goodies like pecans, lemon zest, honey and ground flax - yum!<br /><br />Next time I am going to try to pour the manna into a lined dish so after it's hardened I can pop it out and use a grater, instead of scoring it with a paring knife and scraping it out of the jar with a spoon.<br /><br />Great way to get flavor, good fat, etc. into plain Greek yogurt!

review/summary: fun to experiment with
review/text: I have never used something like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V7XNRQ">Coconut Manna - 15 oz - Container</a> before, so it's all new to me. I didn't try it on toast or bread or make a smoothie with it. Here's how I used it - I used some of this to replace the face in a  vanilla cake and brownies.<br />It worked well for the cake, gave it a slightly coconut flavor, but not very distinctive. The vanilla cake tasted very rich with the substitution. The brownies, I substituted 1/3 of the fat in the brownie recipe for the equal amount of coconut manna. Again, it worked very well, producing a rich flavored brownie with a slightly different flavor, but it was not a distinctive coconut flavor. I would say I'd probably have to substitute 1/2 the amount of fat with the coconut manna to get a coconut flavor. But that experiment will wait for a little longer.<br />You can also use this product on your skin, if you choose to - it makes skin incredibly smooth. You can use it on your hair. It's not an overwhelming coconut smell, just a good clean smell.<br />I only gave this 4 stars simply because there are no sort of instructions with the package. There's no info on making a smoothie or anything like that. There are no directions on how to use this product in baking or cooking. I did search on the interweb, but really did not find out much information.<br /><br />But, if you are the sort of person who is using this type of product, you definitely should buy it - you probably have dozens of recipes for coconut manna.<br />As for me, I intend to keep experimenting by baking with it. I'm thinking maybe chocolate chop cookies, with the coconut manna taking the place of the fat. Or maybe use it to make a coconut cake or icing. I do enjoy this but unfortunately I don't get a lot of time to experiment with baking, just on the weekend. But the holidays are coming up and I plan to add a little bit of coconut manna goodness to my holiday baking. It should be fun.

review/summary: Coconutty goodness
review/text: I wasn't sure what Coconut Mana was good for, but I like coconut, so I thought it would be fun to try. Once I got it I... still had no idea what to do with it. The jar has a website on it that supposedly has recipes, but good luck finding the ones that specifically use Coconut Mana. I tried searching the web for uses and most people just said they ate it plain. Not for me. Finally I found a person who recommended melting it and adding sugar and cocoa to make a chocolate sauce to eat over ice cream. YES! That is the way to use this stuff! I mixed together Coconut Mana, sweetened condensed milk, and cocoa powder, to make one of the best fudge sauces I had ever tasted.<br /><br />So the only really complaint I have about this stuff is the melting time. The directions say to hold it under hot running water for 5-10 minutes. I stuck it in a bowl with hot water and let it sit. I had to replace the water twice and to took nearly a half hour. If it hadn't tasted so good, I probably would have just tossed it after that. But it ended up being worth the wait :) The slow defrost time just gets it knocked down a star.

review/summary: SMOOTH WHOLE ORGANIC Coconut Cream +++
review/text: As compared to other whole coconut items -- I find this one to be very smooth. It still has a bit of nutty body to it -- being whole coconut -- but is much closer to coconut milk than one may expect. It must be due to the processing process being very complete -- as "Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna" IS WHOLE COCONUT. I am surprised at just how creamy this is -- instead of being more meaty [nutty]. One does have to heat it up [as recommended] to get to the full liquid creamy zone. I put mine -- still in its jar -- into some hot water in a small sink and added some hot [nearly boiling] water from an electric hot water kettle about five minutes later -- and got mostly liquid coconut after about ten minutes. Later, I tried adding boiling water to inside the jar directly -- to quickly heat it up -- to add to some oatmeal -- which worked well. This stuff does taste rich -- for a whole coconut cream +++

review/summary: Coconut Oil is amazing...Manna, a bit disappointing.
review/text: My family and I are slowly making changes to eat a bit healthier and naturally.<br /><br />We love Nutiva's Coconut Oil and use it almost exclusively in our cooking and baking, so we were excited to try Nutiva's Coconut Manna.<br /><br />Initially, after opening the jar, I saw that the Manna had separated and resolidified in an odd shape, as if the jars had been tipped during shipping. This didn't bother me much, as I know coconut oil easily liquifies at 76 degrees.<br /><br />The Manna doesn't seem to liquefy quite so easily (although the jar says 'spreads easily at temperatures above 73*'). You can place it in hot tap water for 5-10 minutes, as the directions suggest, but be prepared for the jar to sit a LOT longer before the manna can be easily stirred. A. LOT. LONGER. I even tried placing the jar on our warm, sunny windowsill (with baseboard heat below) for several hours...that didn't work well either.<br /><br />It's all well and good to finally get the Coconut Manna to a softer state, but, it quickly hardens before the next use. Perhaps the product will stay at a spreadable temperature during the warmer months. During fall and winter, everything needs to be warmed up in upstate NY.<br /><br />The smell and taste of the manna is wonderful. However, as much as I love cooking (and really wanted and expected to love the manna), the hassle of getting the product to a useable point is disappointing and too time consuming for using in a quick recipe or spreading on morning toast. :-(

review/summary: gritty pasty semi-tasty
review/text: NOTE: If you like this product and plan to use it, the quickest way to heat (and then properly store in a glass jar) is to put in the trunk of your car on a warm/hot day for a couple of hours...learned this as a soapmaker who uses lots of coconut oil! I then mixed well and poured it into a sterilized mason jar.<br /><br />I LOVE the smell of the Coconut manna, but then I love the smell of all coconut.  I normally use coconut oil in quite a few recipes and this is a slightly different experience as it includes the actual coconut.  The problem for me is that the ground whole coconut tastes and has the texture of....ground whole coconut.  Adding the coconut oil for creaminess isn't changing the gritty to smooth.  It changes the velvety texture of the oil to gritty, pasty (think really really thick peanut butter).<br /><br />The only way I use it is making fresh peanut butter or almond butter in the VitaMix using just the nuts and a spoonful of Manna.  Said peanut butter on sandwich with banana or used in peanut butter cookies is borderline sinful.  This is the only thing I've found tastes good with this product.  I use coconut oil for everything else.<br /><br />I was adding it to various recipes but have found that the earthy/dirty (hard to describe) taste of the ground coconut just doesn't work with much.  In addition, it doesn't work well in smoothies in the vitamix as the manna never fully dissolves or incorporates in the drink.

review/summary: I Prefer Other Forms of Coconut Over This
review/text: The closest description I can think of for this product is any organic nut butter.  The oil separates & sits on top of the flesh.  Two difference are this needs to be rather warm in order to mix the oil back into the flesh.  Once you accomplish this task, it will re-separate in 24 hours.<br /><br />After leaving this to warm overnight on my electric space heater, I opened it up & prepared to stir it.  This was a messy affair & I tired of it quickly.  I scooped everything out of those horrible plastic containers & plopped it all into a glass mason jar.  I then got out my hand held immersion blender & proceeded to blend.  This took some time & initially the end result was worth it.  It was smooth & creamy dreamy!  I added a bit to my morning oatmeal & the flavor was amazing.  Surprisingly it did not add a coconut flavor, it created a buttery flavor.  I was impressed.<br /><br />I patted myself on the back too soon when by the next (keeping it warm on my space heater so I could use it as it is like a rock cool) the oil already separated from the flesh. I am accustomed to dealing with real food.  You know food - stuff that doesn't have a bunch of crap added to it.  I grow, raise & grind my own.  I buy organic & only organic.  My point?  This stuff was even more work than I wanted to deal with!<br /><br />My next attempt was to make an icing replacing butter with the coconut.  Oh my! Delicious!  All I did was combine organic confectioners sugar with the coconut & mix it with my hand mixer.  It turned out creamy with a light coconut flavor.  I loved it!  I put it in the refrigerator & then worried that it would turn hard as a rock.  Not so, it was simply perfect!<br /><br />My last attempt, I tried to recreate my icing.  I guess my house was too cold.  What a mess.  Eventually the bulb went off in my head to put the mixing bowl on the stove to warm it while using the hand mixer.  This did the job.  The next day I decided to enjoy some more coco-nutty icing & I just hated it.  Not sure why exactly.  It didn't turn out exactly the same as the first amazing batch.  I can't put my finger on what turned me off so badly but that is it for me.<br /><br />I am sticking with coconut butter & coconut oil.  This stuff is simply too much work & I can get the results I desire using either of the just mentioned forms of coconut with a heck of a lot less work.<br /><br />I removed a star for the plastic packaging.  What makes it worse is the need to keep this warm for use.  At the very least, get this stuff out of the plastic & into glass pronto for your healths sake!  If you love this type of whole coconut puree, try Wilderness Family Naturals.  They sell the exact same stuff in glass!  You can find them on Amazon & they have their own website.<br /><br />I removed a second star for the difficulty to use & my sudden dislike.  Excluding the chemicals that leach into the coconut, the only ingredient is whole coconut & it is Organic.  Vegans, this is a great alternative to butter on your toast, veggies & more!  It is way better than the fake stuff marketed as food to Vegans.

I did what it said and melted the product (which wasn't easy - had to set it in a warm oven turned off for ages, stirring every hour or so) which just mixed the dark, grainier parts in. I've tried it on toast, which was strange but not bad. I've put it in my coffee, which tastes pretty good, but for the oil slick on the surface and the dregs at the bottom of the cup. I haven't tried it in a smoothie... not sure how much to add or in what form (melted? solid?) So, while this is a cool product - I mean, this much straight coconut in this form would be impossible to make yourself - I just haven't found the right use for it.

review/summary: Not sold on it, but not giving up on it either
review/text: I have been trying to reduce fat, specifically the bad fats, in my diet lately, and try to find ways to increase fiber without eating things that taste like cardboard, so when I had a chance to try coconut manna, I jumped at it.  The packaging says it is a healthy substitute for butter, and can be used as a spread.  My mouth watered at the idea of a bit of this, some nutella, and a banana wrapped up in a whole grain wrap.  The potential here was exciting for someone who loves coconut like I do.<br /><br />The packaging indicated that the oil separates from the coconut, and you must put the container in hot water for five to ten minutes for everything to soften, so that you can stir it all up to a nice smooth consistency.  Sound pretty easy right?  Wrong.  I found after leaving the container in a bowl of hot water for 10 minutes, it was still too hard to stir.  It took three rounds of hot water bath-vigorous stir cycle to get this to wear I could use it.  I tasted it, and was sad that it did not taste nearly as good as I anticipated.  It also had a weird gritty texture, and overall I was not crazy about it.<br /><br />Since clearly this was not going to work as a spread for me, I instead used while cooking mulligatawny soup.  I had created a low fat version of the soup without butter, cream, or milk, so the coconut manna helped add a bit of richness to it.  However, it is still a bit high in calories to be something I would use daily.  I will probably continue using olive oil for much of my cooking, but I do plan on experimenting with the coconut manna when making smoothies, sauces, desserts, and ethnic dishes.  It did nicely in my soup.<br /><br />I am not completely sold on coconut manna, but I am not ready to give up on it either.

review/summary: Strictly a summertime treat
review/text: Just one ingredient:  super-fine pureed Coconut.<br /><br />I like the idea, but the physical properties of coconut create a severe disadvantage.  It "freezes" at too high a temperature (73 degrees Fahrenheit) and has to be warmed up each time you want to use it.  When the can arrived it had separated, with the coconut fat on top and the solids at the bottom.  I immersed it in hot water for 5 minutes and then spent another ten minutes stabbing, chopping and stirring it with a butterknife to get all the lumps out.  Once liquefied, it behaves quite a bit like sesame tahini.  It's very runny in the jar & on the knife, but on my tongue it felt sticky like peanut butter.  It tastes like coconut and is actually quite pleasant.  It might be really good mixed with honey.<br /><br />The next day when I wanted to have some more, I opened the jar to find it had solidified again like a chunk of candle wax.  So I re-melted it.  After another 10 minutes of chopping and stirring I have to conclude that this snack is not worth the hassle.  I might like it better in the summer when temperatures are high enough for it to stay liquid ... but in cool weather this item is a fail.  Too much work and not enough reward for me.

The 15oz jar is certified organic by Ecocert & QUI and is distributed by Nutiva in Oxnard, CA.<br />My only reservation about the product is that it needs to be softened before using. The instructions recommend the jar be placed in hot tap water for 5-10 minutes. For me it took over 20 minutes for the Coconut Manna to soften around the jar's edges. (It never did liquefy.) Some Coconut Manna chunks also took awhile to melt in boiling hot oats.

review/summary: A lot of work for a slight treat
review/text: First of all, this is not easy to use.  My manna shifted during packaging or shipping, so it was a solid chunk on the side of the jar.  I put it in a hot water bath and stirred and chipped away, but it took about 15 minutes of my husband stirring frantically to get the top liquefied to a spreadable state.  The bottom would not soften for the longest time for some reason.  After that bit of chaos, I was hoping for something really special.<br /><br />I was disappointed.  We tried our manna on pancakes (which is a great fiber filled option for a sweetener, instead of syrup).  The gritty texture and not quite sweet flavor was off-putting to me.  My husband loved it, but agreed it was gritty.<br /><br />I also dipped some chunky granola in it.  I found the texture and flavor easier to eat on the granola.<br /><br />We will continue to use it, but we know to prepare a bit of time to get this ready.

review/text: I don't eat bread or toast, so I can't speak to using it in that fashion, but I know that it's healthy and delicious. I've eaten it out of the jar thus far. You do have to warm it up and then stir it up, before eating it. Because there is dried coconut in the mix it's not completely smooth...but that just adds to the flavor and texture. I also use Nutiva's coconut oil for lots of things, including body oil, but I also mix it with peanut butter as a topping for low carb ice cream because it solidifies when it hits the ice cream forming a peanut buttery shell. I bet this would be excellent in place of the oil and add fiber, as well. I think I'll give it a try.<br /><br />This manna is fragrant, luxurious and delicious. I highly recommend it. As I type this it's on sale til the end of November '11 - so pick some up, you won't be sorry.

I thought I'd try this "manna" and see if we liked it as much as regular coconut oil.<br /><br />Like regular coconut oil, the manna has a very nice coconut fragrance.  Like some of the other reviewers, I was a little surprised to see that it's very hard and solid in the jar.  It reminded me of wax or soap, the way I could scratch off little ribbons with a spoon.  I ate some that way and liked it despite the slight grittiness. I tried some on an english muffin in place of butter - I had to leave scraped chunks on top and melt it in the microwave to get it to spread.  I know the directions say to heat it in a pan of hot water before using it, but who has time to do that every day?<br /><br />The bottom line is that I'll stick with Nutiva coconut oil for daily use.  Even the added fiber and protein in this product doesn't outweigh the fact that this product isn't "ready to use" when you take off the lid.

review/summary: Not exactly a miracle food, but pretty darn nice.
review/text: I've recently started using coconut oil in cooking mostly because I love its flavor and aroma.  I love Nutiva coconut oil, so I thought Nutiva's Manna would be worth a try, and I was correct.  It's something quite different from coconut oil.  I presume that since the only ingredient is "organic whole coconut" that Manna is basically finely ground coconut.  Powdered, actually.  And therein lies my only real objection to this product as a spread that "replaces cream cheese and butter"  It can have a gritty mouth feel.  Oddly, not every taste felt gritty to me, but the grittiness was more marked the warmer the Manna became.<br /><br />And yet, I ate it out of the jar in solid form (The temperature in here hovers around 65 degrees most of the year; much too cool for the Manna to liquefy on its own.) quite happily, so chalk one up for Manna as one of those things you dip into occasionally, like peanut butter or Nutella.  But Manna satisfies more quickly than the other two; a little goes a long way, which is good, I expect.  However I did put some on a piece of bread, and in small amounts, on something that has a lot of texture of its own, what you notice is the flavor, not the texture. Would I eat it with bagels and lox instead of cream cheese?  No.  Would I use it on a sandwich instead of butter?  Well it depends on what the sandwich filling was.  Something that would be complimented by a mild, sweet, coconut flavor would work, I think, maybe a slap-up variation on banh mi.<br /><br />I'm guessing it would be terrific in a smoothie, though unless you're using it for the alleged health benefits, I don't see much point since it would take some time to blend into a cold liquid, and at 100 calories a Tbsp, you'd be consuming a lot of it to get the flavor benefit.<br /><br />No, I'm going to think of it the way I think of peanut butter, a tasty snack for just the right time and place.  I'll use the oil for cooking as I always have.  If I end up lowering my cholesterol or getting any other benefit from Manna other than a lovely flavor, then lucky me.

review/summary: Great for Cravings!
review/text: Coconut manna is definitely an acquired taste.  In my previous review I mentioned that I hate the texture etc.  Since I have gone paleo and am cutting out all sugars etc I still crave and desire something sweet.  So I gave the manna another try.  I am glad I did.  It does have the right amount of sweetness to prevent me from eating something unhealthy and I can add cocoa powder to make something chocolately and somewhat sweet.  I am glad I stuck it out and got used to this.  Now I can't imagine living without it as it saves me from binging on some crap with sugar or corn fructose syrup.

review/summary: Way tastier than just coconut oil for a nutritional supplement
review/text: I've been living the paleo/primal lifestyle for quite sometime now, and coconut oil has become a big part of my calorie intake.  I usually keep a jar with a spoon close by, but after months and months of downing spoonfuls at a time it has started to lose it's appeal.<br /><br />Enter "Nutiva Coconut Manna Good Stuff 16 oz jar."  It's actually a whole food with a whole food flavor.  It tastes like a bite of a fresh coconut - (a little richer due to the fat content) and I love it.  It doesn't have that sickening and dull taste that wore on me like regular cold pressed coconut oil did.<br /><br />If you want something to curb your hunger, make your skin softer (by eating, not topical - you would probably turn into a coconut if you rubbed this stuff on you) and you dig the full coconut flavor, then I highly recommend Coconut Jar Manna Yummy Paste.<br /><br />Heads up -- it's generally separated when you open a new jar. Melt it by holding the closed jar under hot water and stir well.<br /><br />Try this. Your taste buds will thank you.

review/summary: Macaroon on a spoon
review/text: Coconut oil is a saturated fat. At first glance that alone might make dieters and the health conscious recoil in fear.  Haven't we been told that all saturated fats are artery clogging sludge?  As it turns out, coconut oil is emerging as a near miracle food. Pacific Island populations who get 30-60 percent of their total caloric intake from fully saturated coconut oil have all shown nearly non-existent rates of cardiovascular disease.  The multitude of benefits, including strengthening the immune system and regulating metabolism, make fascinating reading readily available in technical journals and web resources.  Unlike many foods considered healthy, coconut flesh is incredibly delicious.  Since most of us, though, don't relish the idea of hacking the nut to pieces with machetes in the kitchen, coconut is being made conveniently available as in this product, Coconut Manna; a combination of ground coconut flesh and associated oil.  I've been incorporating coconut oil into health shakes so was anxious to try this product which incorporated the flesh as well.  Anyone who has used coconut oil knows that it likes to congeal and form a solid at normal room temperatures and inevitably so in cool locations.  Opening this coconut manna container revealed what resembled a wad of lumpfish stuck to the walls packed in oil.  Not very appetizing.  A metal spoon employed to break it up encountered stubborn resistance.  Submerging the plastic container in warm water would have returned it to an easily workable state, but not something you typically want to do if making a quick health shake or spread.  For that it lost one or maybe one and a half points.  But that's just the natural state of the food and Nutra can't be faulted for that.  The product itself once more malleable is absolutely delicious.  It's tempting to just eat it off the spoon before it makes it to whatever vehicle you planned to park it on.  For smoothy/shake makers, the pure oil form is probably easier to use, though it can congeal also, though probably not as readily or as stubbornly as this manna. It is delicious, but only if you want to take the time to render it at a temperature to make it more easily spread and applied.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: Being a big organic coconut oil fan for several years now, I've been really curious about these coconut 'mana' products since I first heard of them so I was delighted to give this one a try.<br /><br />The coconut mana in my container was quite solid when I received it (being cold and in the middle of November in the Pacific Northwest) and the oil had separated from the creme (the former being pure white and the latter being a creamy color) so I let the container sit in hot water for about 30 minutes to soften so I could blend them together. (Nutiva's instructions recommend 5-10 minutes but that may only work if you're in a very warm climate). Afterwards I was able to combine the 2 together pretty easily.<br /><br />It has a pleasant and mildly sweet coconut flavour; but I would hesitate to say it 'melts in your mouth' like Nutiva claims.  It has the consistency of a natural nut butter that has had much of the oil drained out so it's quite dry and stiff and a little 'granular' which may be a problem if you want to spread it on something delicate. Me? I like to eat it straight right out of the container. But I think it would be awesome in recipes, say mixed with dried coconut, almonds or mixed nuts, rolled into balls and dipped in dark chocolate! Yummm!

review/summary: Still Experimenting-- So Far So Good
review/text: "Organic Whole Coconut" sounds simple enough, but I think I have a lot to learn about Coconut Manna.  We've used coconut oil in cooking for years, and shredded coconut in cookies and desserts, and once in awhile we'll bring home a whole coconut to drink the milk and scrape out the meat-- but this is something different.  As other reviewers note, it needs preparation before use: warm the jar in hot water for awhile, otherwise it's solid and chunky.  This may take some time-- really the only drawback to this product.  Once it's achieved a soft consistency, it was good on toast for breakfast, tho I added some powdered sugar to taste. My wife and daughter enjoyed it on their morning oatmeal.  Next experiment: Thai food.  I'm thinking it may work well in the rice cooker as well-- we'll see.<br /><br />First impression: positive.  I look forward to trying it in other permutations.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy whole coconut - pure organic food
review/text: Nutiva adds to its range of organic whole food products with coconut manna, a whole coconut meat product that is organic and nutritious. This is not the same as their coconut oil - this is the full coconut flesh - which does have a high "healthy" fat content. Having been satisfied with other Nutiva products I've used (such as hemp & chia seeds, coconut oil, hemp protein powder mixes, etc.), I expected high quality and wasn't disappointed. This coconut manna tastes great and is easy to use and store. You can put some in any recipe that calls for coconut and this sure beats having to crack open a fresh cocunut and cut out the coconut meat. For quality, organic coconut that doesn't require coconut cracking labor, Nutiva offers an excellent option.

review/text: I didn't really know what to expect from this product because I have never tried anything like it before.  The first thing I found is that it takes a lot longer to warm it up and get it to a point where it is spreadable, so if you're in a hurry for it, you may be frustrated.  The taste was pretty good.  I like the flavor of coconut, but I'm just not sure if this is worth the high fat and calorie content.  In small amounts it's quite tasty, but too much is just not good.  So overall, it is okay.  It tastes pretty good, but I wouldn't want to eat it everyday.

review/summary: Nice flavor, but not entirely user friendly
review/text: Assuming you like the taste of coconut (and I do), Nutiva's organic coconut manna has a lot of potential in the kitchen. Just a spoonful of this coconut butter -- nothing but finely ground up coconut meat including the coconut oil -- will give everything you add it to a creamy coconut richness. I liked the short ingredient list (organic whole coconut) and loved the way it smelled when I opened the jar. It has a much more nutty, creamy fragrance than plain coconut oil.<br /><br />Getting the coconut manna to the point where I could use it was a bit tricky. As per the directions on the package, I put the jar in hot water for 15 minutes and attempted to stir. The top, mostly coconut oil, melted just fine. The bottom did not. Even after putting it back in the hot water for a while, I didn't so much stir as chisel away with the heaviest butter knife I could find.<br /><br />30 minutes later, I finally got it to the texture of creamed honey and tried a little. It definitely does coat your tongue with a sticky, slightly gritty feel (I would not recommend eating it straight out of the jar, on its own), but the taste -- coconut-y, rich, and not too sweet -- was pleasant. I spread it on toast with matamis na bao (coconut caramel) drizzled on top for a little more sweetness and enjoyed it. Due to the high fat content, it is very, very filling.<br /><br />My favorite application so far has been oatmeal. A spoonful stirred in made my regular oatmeal taste like Thai sticky rice! Just a little goes a long way to adding flavor, creaminess, and some stick-to-your-ribs fiber and fat. I haven't been able to find ratios for substituting it in baked goods, but I am more likely to try adding a teaspoon or two for flavor than swapping out all the oil of a recipe. I think the coconut manna will make some amazing tropical flavored smoothies once the weather starts warming up again.<br /><br />I feel a little daunted by the thought of having to stir the jar every time I use it, even though it shouldn't be as bad as the first time. Even in California, it's not exactly spreadable at room temperature. Although I doubt coconut butter will become a pantry staple for me, I find that I am looking forward to incorporating a spoonful here and there in my cooking and baking.

review/summary: Delicious and smooth
review/text: I routinely use some coconut oil in cooking since it is a very healthy fat with zero trans fat. Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna is different than coconut oil in that it is more of a solid, but I absolutely love it! It's almost like spread butter, in fact it would be good to use as a replacement for butter. The flavor is great and would be super to use it in cooking as well. I put a spoonful in green beans and I think it adds a wonderful flavor to them.<br />Nutiva's website has some great recipes for smoothies, brownies, etc. I also got Nutiva's Chia Seeds and it has a recipe for cereal using both products. The product label states that it contains 12% fiber which is great and 9% protein...that is awesome!<br />It's also really convenient to have the pack of 2. I absolutely HATE running out of something I use often and I like having the second one on hand. When I open it...it's time to get more! You don't have to refrigerate it either so that is a plus. Great product!<br /><br />Added review: Nov. 1, 2011<br />My husband took one of the containers to work and said it is great when you use it off the top, but if you heat it up like it recommends the taste and texture changes. He hates both! He tried it as butter on wafers and he said it was not great either. However, he did use it as butter on popcorn and it was delicious. Based on his review, I changed it to a four star.

review/summary: Manna from Nutiva
review/text: I love coconut oil, and Nutiva is one of my favorite brands, so of course I had to try coconut butter/manna. At least as far as I can tell, this coconut "manna" is what you also find referred to as coconut "butter". My boyfriend thought it would be a good substitute for coconut oil in baking - he uses the oil in a lot of things including flour tortillas and deep dish pizza crust (our "secret" ingredient) - but it really is better to use the oil. The tortillas are a little stiffer with the manna and pizza dough a little harder to work with and the end texture not quite as good. Still, the manna/butter does have some great uses - what I mostly use it for is my vegan cheese recipe. Once you refrigerate the nut cheese, the coconut butter is what makes it take on a more solid texture.<br />The reason I didn't give it five stars is just because I think the Nutiva coconut oil is so great with great coconut smell and flavor and the manna is somewhat limited in comparison. If you already have the oil and are coo coo for coconut and looking for more, then maybe you want to try this. Or if you have a recipe that calls for it, it's probably worth it, but anything *I* have used the manna for I could have used the oil for with the same or better results.

review/text: Trying to eat more unprocessed and natural foods, I had been interested in coconut manna although I wasn't quite sure what to expect. It's basically a coconut cream made from organic dried coconut meat that is spreadable like butter (a little more gritty than butter, though).<br /><br />When I received it, I opened the container - the wonderful smell of coconut wafted up, but it had clearly melted and resolidified. I was quite hesitant at that point. Reading some reviews and suggestions on how to eat it, I warmed it in a bowl of warm water, then dipped my finger in for a taste.<br /><br />Wow. It is delish.<br /><br />It is also high in fat, so I will be using it sparingly, but it teaspoon goes well with my chia seeds for a breakfast, and I've used it to saute meat for some Thai dishes. I also added it to a strawberry smoothie - YUM!<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that it's in a plastic tub, especially because it has to be heated to be used. I removed mine from the packaging it came in and placed it in a glass jar (which actually seems to reduce the warm water heat time).

review/text: I love coconut, but when I bought this product, I still wasn't entirely sure what I planned to do with it.  Living in cold, northern climes, smoothies aren't that appealing for many months a year.  Now, I know.  I'm going to eat it out of the jar on a spoon.<br /><br />Like I said, I live in the cold north, and this product was indeed rock solid when I first opened the jar.  I boiled some water for tea, then after the leftover water had cooled down for a few minutes, I pour it into a bowl and set the jar of Coconut Manna in it.  I confess I forgot about it for a little while and it probably sat in the hot water for 10-15 minutes.  After that, it was no harder to stir than a new jar of natural peanut butter.  When I licked the stirring spoon, it was so delicious my head nearly fell off.  I ate a couple spoonfuls and then put the jar away.<br /><br />A few hours later, I opened the jar again out of curiosity.  Though starting to solidify around the edges, it was still mostly soft.  Good to know that after you go through the trouble to process it, it stays usable (eatable) for quite a while.

review/summary: Now my favorite coconut butter!
review/text: I have to admit when I read 'made from dried coconuts...melts in your mouth", I thought this would be freeze-dried coconut bits for snacking. I did not expect the jar of heaven instead........<br /><br />I reviewed Artisana 100% Organic Raw Coconut Butter -- 16 oz, I've used it as my go-to spread for flax seed microwave muffins, and especially love it in yellow curry (or any curry for that matter!). I had not found another brand that I liked better for taste. Until now.<br /><br />I've been a faithful user of Nutiva coconut oil for a long time, buying it by the 5 gallon pail. If you love Nutiva coconut oil, imagine that wonderful coconut smell amplified a thousandfold. Imagine now, the coconut manna, which TASTES like that smell. It's so good, you can actually eat it on a spoon straight out of the jar. It does not have the high particulate content like the Artisana, instead this is very smooth and creamy yet it's substantial in your mouth. It also made my curry recipe FINALLY taste like the one from the Thai restaurant that we gave up for budgetary reasons.<br /><br />If you are searching for THE perfect coconut butter, THIS is your stuff! Don't even bother wasting a cent on any other brand, get this! There are instructions on the jar for tempering in case your product separates, but mine arrived perfectly blended even though the outside temperature was way above its melting point. It was easy to scoop out (and eat right out of the jar). I even put some of this on top of my sunny-side-up eggs right before removing from the skillet, and it made them taste even better!<br />Love this and it will forever be on my reorder list! THANKS NUTIVA for yet another great product!

review/summary: Nice idea, but full of fat.
review/text: If you're sick of using butter and need an alternative, by all means try this product. Unless you're frying eggs and do not wish for them to taste of coconut, this product was designed to replace the fat in your diet with something more healthy. There are recipes too - it's quite nice in oatmeal and enhances smoothies quite well - something I've been trying to find for quite some time. The most aggravating thing, however, is that the product solidifies and you have to let it soak in how water for 5-10 minutes before you can use it EACH time. That can be annoying if you're in a hurry as I usually am most mornings. It isn't sweet so you won't be adding additional sugar to your recipes - just the flavor. A very neat product, but something that you should use very sparingly because of the fat content. Recommend but with the above caution.

review/summary: Depends what you want to use it for
review/text: OK, I am used to using coconut oil bought at grocery store and some stuff I ordered in bulk. The Nutiva is richer. you can feel the richness when you touch it and when you look at it. But for the things I want coconut oil for it doesn't work as good as the cheaper stuff....It isn't good to fry with. It turns quite dark when cooked with. If you just melted it over a double boiler it probably do a lot better.<br /><br />And I use coconut oil in soap making and skin cream making. Because it turns so dark when cooked it doesn't do well for either of these. Plus, it leaves a smell in the skin cream I made -- when the cheaper kinds don't have any odor. It isn't a bad smell but it isn't one you want on skin probably.<br /><br />So, I think it depends what you want to use it for. Melting it slowly and adding it to a spread is an ideal way to use this product. If that is what you use it for then it is probably quite good, better than the cheap stuff.

review/summary: Ok for cooking, but a hassle for "quick" use.
review/text: Following the instructions provided with the Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna, you unfortunately still do not get a smooth, usable product. When I first opened it, I was surprised to see a hard, white surface right beneath the lid, where the product had obviously melted and then resolidified during shipment. I shaved a bit off with a knife to taste, and sure enough, it tasted like natural coconut. That's a good sign. I went ahead and followed the instructions to basically melt/mix the product, placing it under hot running tap water for 5-10 minutes (the directions say two), and that really didn't make much of a dent. After letting it sit for another 10 minutes, it was finally mixable.<br /><br />So mix it I did, only to be greeted with a very unpleasant, gritty texture. That might not be that big a deal if you're cooking with it (using it to replace butter for instance), but it's not exactly a good characteristic for something that Nutiva mentions spreading on bread or crackers. The smoothie recommendation is also suspect because of the grit, especially since it would start to harden again the minute it gets remotely close to a frosty beverage. For this kind of usage, the Coconut Manna is more hassle than it's worth.<br /><br />I'll figure out a way to use this (planning on using it in a Thai-style coconut curry), but this is not the convenient product it's marketed to be. As an ingredient for cooking, I say it works and would be easy enough to use, but as a quick, spreadable addition to your  foods, it's disappointing to me.

review/text: I've been using coconut oil for some years and I selected this in the Vine program because everything else I clicked on was not available.<br />It has an odd flavor, not like regular coconut oil and a gritty texture that I don't like, even when gently softened in warm water.<br />It did not blend smoothly into the cream soups that I have been preparing (with coconut oil) for some years.<br />I can't explain all the details of just why I don't like this product but it certainly does not live up to the hype.<br />I will stick with the regular organic, extra virgin coconut oil from the same producer.  It is a superior product and much more versatile than this "Manna"

review/summary: It's...alright
review/text: Let me begin by saying that I am not a super health nut. I don't shop at Trader Joe's regularly, partially because there isn't one near me and partially because I'm fine with eating regular/typical food from a regular/typical grocery store. I like coconut and I like to try new things, so I requested this from the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />Nutiva brags that there are recipes to try on their website nutiva.com. However, all the recipes I saw required not only coconut manna, but also hemp oil or hemp seed, or other *natural/organic* whatever ingredients that I do not have nor do I want to buy. Anyway, so those recipes were a bust for me.<br /><br />The coconut manna, like it says on the container, needs to be heated by placing the jar in a bowl of hot tap water, and then stirring before it is the *melt in your mouth* consistency. Let me tell you, the first time I tried it, this required a lot of stirring. However, once heated and stirred, it has a runny peanut butter consistency. But, when tasted, there is a gritty kind of after taste.<br /><br />It is simply organic coconut, nothing else. This is not the "sweetened" coconut you get flakes of on cookies. That is fine, but consider yourself warned. I have tried it spread on toast (with butter and a little cinnamon sugar) and that was alright. It made a nice flavor on toast, but I could definitely feel/taste the grittiness of the coconut. I've also put it in plain oatmeal, with a little brown sugar, raisins, and cinnamon. This was better than the toast. I haven't tried baking with it nor with smoothies yet but will soon.<br /><br />I would not call this the "ideal everything spread" as the jar claims, nor would I replace cream, cream cheese or butter with coconut manna. However, I like it and will continue to experiment with different ways of incorporating it into snacks and meals.

review/summary: Inconvenient novelty
review/text: I don't quite understand this product.<br /><br />The product at my kitchen temperature consists of a large and pretty sincerely solid solid on the bottom of the jar and an oil on top.  You may use either substance by itself, but if you want to use the product as designed you should mix the solid and the liquid together so that any cc is the same viscosity and has the same ratio of ingredients and as any other cc.<br /><br />The solid really is, and until it's liquefied you can't use the product.<br /><br />According to the Amazon description page, which is no doubt what many people will rely on in deciding whether to buy this product, "To liquify [sic], place jar in hot water for 2 minutes and stir."  I don't know exactly what the term "hot water" means, but unless it means more than boiling (which is impossible except in a sealed vessel such as a pressure cooker), this won't work.  Not after two minutes and not after twice that again.  Unless they're talking about two minutes on Pluto, whose day is 6 Earth days plus 9 hours, which is 6.375 times longer, which when multiplied by 2 minutes is 12 Earth minutes plus 45 seconds, which would make more sense (except for the Pluto part).<br /><br />The Nutiva Web site says you can melt it by placing it in a hot but not boiling water bath for -- and you'll see I'm quoting here -- "a few moments."  I don't know about you, but to me "a few moments" is significantly less than the two minutes we already know is more than a little bit too little.  And don't forget that to those few moments you have to add the time it takes to gather a heat-proof vessel and water and turn on the stove and then wait for the water to heat up.  Not to mention the expense, however little, of producing that heat and buying that water.  Not to mention having to remember to turn off that heat source.  Not to mention washing however sincerely you want to that heating vessel, after you've waited for it cool down sufficiently, and then drying it and returning it whence it came.<br /><br />Sheeesh.<br /><br />The texture of the properly mixed substance -- a colloid suspension that must eventually separate, if I'm not mistaken -- when eaten plain from a spoon or the superior end of someone's superior natal cleft is not what I expected, being more gritty like wasabi than velvety like the inside part of good caviar.  Still, like wasabi it's not designed to be licked from a spoon like ice cream, so I subtract no stars for this.<br /><br />Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna, 15-Ounce (Pack of 2) seems to me like quite a specialty product, almost a novelty, which is why I said I don't quite understand it.  In order to add it to "smoothies, sauces, and dressings" or to use it in any other way, according to the manufacturer you start by liquefying it in a hot water bath and then mixing it.  This makes it quite different from, say, apple butter, which you just open the jar of and out of from which you dip or pour some.<br /><br />So many other similar foods require less effort and certainly less time, such as margarine and honey.<br /><br />And this product, when used as recommended by the manufacturer, requires at least that you have a heating vessel and water and a source of heat, so you probably won't want to take it on a picnic or to the local swimming hole.  So many other similar foods require no additional parts except maybe a spoon, such as ranch dressing and yogurt and orange marmalade.  And they don't require mixing.<br /><br />For the inconvenience, which makes it less likely I will use the product even if I knew the best way to use it, I subtract two stars.<br /><br />The Amazon description page says, "Coconut Manna will delight people looking for coconut butter, coconut cream, coconut oil butter and coconut body butter."  If by coconut body butter is meant a substance you would slather all over your body for some reason, I will not be reporting on that particular use for this review.  Ever.<br /><br />Those of you who've read a few of my recent reviews will not be surprised to learn that I did experiment with some more off-label uses, and here are the results.<br /><br />-- You should not expect this food to be a good substitute for the butter in Alfredo sauce or for the egg whites in a meringue.<br /><br />-- You should not paint your house with this food unless you really, really like lots more local wildlife than you ever knew existed.  You should use real paint.<br /><br />-- This product is an utter failure as a substitute for parakeet shampoo.  You should use real parakeet shampoo.<br /><br />-- As a shaving cream it sucks hard unless you like many small lacerations on your face.  You should use real shaving cream.<br /><br />-- It makes for a terrible antibiotic ointment for many small lacerations on your face unless you like many pusillanimous and mephitic infections on your face.  Speaking strictly for myself here, as it turns out I do not.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, despite all the failures in the bulleted list just above I subtract no further stars.

review/summary: Gritty texture!
review/text: This does have a true coconut flavor.  However, when I got it, the manna had obviously melted and then solidified again (it had obviously been on its side when it melted, because that's how it was when it came to my doorstep).  I had to soften it.  The directions said to set in hot water for 10 minutes to soften, so I did.  Still hard as a rock.  Tried setting the jar in hot water for another 20 minutes, but it still didn't soften.  So I put it on my kitchen heater vent for an hour.  That did the trick; it was mostly softened, so after stirring the hard part into the soft part, the jar went back on my heater vent for another hour.  The finished doing the job.  So, now, with a very soft product, I got a spoon and tasted it.  It was *so* gritty!  And it stuck to the roof of my mouth worse than peanut butter.<br /><br />I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WV153I">Artisana 100% Organic Raw Coconut Butter -- 16 oz</a>, which is slightly softer and has absolutely no gritty feel -- and the Artisana doesn't stick to the roof of my mouth either.

review/summary: Unexpected uses
review/text: I can't say this "melts in the mouth" but it's good stuff.  As the package says, it tends to separate.  I received two jars through the Vine program.  The first I heated, stirred up and tried to use as directed - as a sort of peanut butter substitute.  It was ok but not something I'd do again.  Then I tried adding it to a lackluster jarred curry sauce and it was fabulous!  It added depth and a nutty warmth.  For the second jar, I used the coconut oil on top as cooking oil and the dried coconut underneath in pastries and candies.  It gave a fantastic coconut flavor without the high moisture content that can make coconut tricky to cook with.  I was dieting at the time and used some of the coconut flesh in place of my ever-so-scrummy morning snack of 18 almonds - it tasted better and seemed to keep me fuller.  I'll probably keep a jar of this around for baking and emergency meals.

review/text: I was bummed to discover Nutiva switched to plastic packaging for this product..which used to come in glass. This is a wonderful product otherwise! Coconut Manna is the equivalent of coconut butter, don't get it confused with coconut oil, this contains coconut flesh.<br />I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this as a body butter!! Yes, if it's cooler than 72 degrees F, it's going to be a solid and not spreadable (as you'll find with any coconut butter). So, before I get in the shower I place the jar in a sink full of hot water and it's perfect when I get out. Really moisturizes dry areas and was a dream on my belly during pregnancy :)<br />Yes, it's also delicious in many recipes and Nutiva's website offers recipe suggestions too. I only wish they would've kept the glass packaging they origianlly had, and others like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WV153I">Artisana 100% Organic Raw Coconut Butter -- 16 oz</a> still use.

It tastes fresh and rich.<br /><br />I did find myself too lazy to put the jar in warm water when it got too firm to work with, so I microwaved the open jar 5-10 seconds at a time. The manufacturer did not suggest this, so be careful!

review/summary: Healthy Coconut
review/text: "Coconut Manna" is very much like coconut oil (it can be used interchangeably). This certainly gets fives stars for being a very healthy product.  Unlike coconut oil however this product is much harder and not completely blended.  At the top is a nice white coconut oil type substance but about an inch down is a darker colored much harder substance.<br /><br />If you are going to use it as a "spread", rather than as an ingredient in your cooking, then you'll need to warm it up.  I'm not really patient enough for the "soak in hot water" approach, but if you scoop/scrape it out and then (in a safe container) put it in a warm oven it melts quickly and easily.<br /><br />This is a great healthy product, but I think I'll stick to using coconut oil and coconut flakes.

review/summary: I wanted to love this product, but my house is not warm enough
review/text: I love the taste of coconut, and I know there are just so many health benefits to it as well.  So I wanted to love this.<br /><br />However, when it arrived and I eagerly opened the jar... there was a very solid white layer on top.  Okay, I know my house isn't above 73 degrees in the winter.  So I followed the instructions, putting the jar in HOT tap water for about 5 minutes (the directions say two minutes)... and opening it again, it was possible to s-c-r-a-p-e some of the white solid away.  That was not pleasant tasting, and as I continued to play with soaking the stuff in hot water over the next FEW hours, I realized the white stuff was oil, with the "solid" coconut being a separate layer below.  That remained ROCK-HARD and impossible to even chip at with a knife.<br /><br />I ended up placing the jar near the heating vent... and after a couple of hours, still with a fair amount of effort on my part, I was able to stir the two layers together.<br /><br />Since then, if I want to use it, I can generally get it to a usable consistency with about a 20 minute soak in HOT water.  That is way more work than I want to put in.<br /><br />Taste?  I love it.  I tried it on squash (mmmm!), on toast, straight from the spoon... and it is good.  But I will be setting the second jar aside and pulling it out next summer.  This is not a fall or winter product for my household.

review/summary: Not Sure Why It's Considered Manna
review/text: Coconut butter and honey sandwiches with friends were my first exposure to Coconut Manna. Better than creamy peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, I decided to try it at home.  I wasn't prepared for the oily layer resting on top of a chip-able rock solid coconut in the new jar. Placing the jar in warm water for two minutes before stirring the oil and coconut solids together makes it more visually pleasing  and on par with it's good taste. Lets just say you won't be eating this from the jar WITHOUT warming it up. Once warm, the coconut butter is great to add into smoothies, puddings, stews, soups, hot cereals or any other item you might add nut butters into.<br /><br />I must admit the jellied coconut oil floating on top gave me the creeps. I know coconut is healthy and all, it just takes some getting used to.  I like it but it's not my idea of manna from heaven. First I'm going on a tropical smoothie binge while remembering the tropical delights of past Hawaiian vacations. Then, I'll venture into more tropical island fusion recipes I enjoy that use coconut butter as an ingredient.

review/summary: Disappointed - should have read more carefully
review/text: I love Yorkshire tea, and usually purchase the 40 count tea BAGS - I purchased these because they were eligible for Amazon Prime shipping (yay), but didn't notice that they are not tea bags, they are "sachets" - the bags have no string (good for sun tea and bulk tea) and more importantly, I believe the bags have MORE TEA in them. One of these "sachets" did not brew up as strong and flavorful a cup of this great tea as I am used to with the bags. Now I have 6 boxes :(. At least the boxes only have 20 bags, er, sachets, but I'm going to have to use two per cup for the same brew. Also, the box is BIGGER, and each "sachet" is INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED (which will keep it fresher, but is very packaging intensive and wasteful and I would much prefer the non-wrapped bags with no string and tab), and each box only has 20 sachets, each of which has less tea than the original bag style. It all adds up to much more bulk and waste and less tea for your money. Do try Yorkshire Tea, but get one of the products with 40 count bags instead of this one.

Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The original flavor reviewed here tastes a lot like Sprite, but Ramune also comes in several other flavors. It uses high fructose corn syrup and/or cane sugar as a sweetener (It lists both on the label, which usually means that it uses whatever is cheapest on the world market at the time of bottling. Listing both also means that they don't have to change their labeling every time they change sweetener.)<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more.<br /><br />Ramune six-packs are easy to find at just about any Asian market at around $7 or $8. If you have to order online, try some of the various Asian food sites out there as the price here is just too high to justify unless you have absolutely no other option.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.

review/summary: Sangaria Ramune 6 pack
review/text: This was the first time we have tried this product and we loved it! It is very popular as a soft drink in Japan-and we were unable to locate it here in the US until now, so we just decided to order it. It is very good and a rather novel was to seal the bottle (with a glass marble)!! We will definately buy it again.

review/summary: Bitter Carob Powder
review/text: I love carob powder and have bought it many times, both toasted and raw. It has a natural sweetness. This is the first time I've tried Bob's Red Mill carob powder.  I usually love their products, but this carob is bitter. Maybe they toasted it too long...? I like to mix carob powder with melted expeller pressed coconut oil to make homemade unsweetened carob bars. My bars are usually sweet enough without any added sweetener - but not with this stuff, unfortunately.
