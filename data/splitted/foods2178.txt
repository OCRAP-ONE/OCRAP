review/summary: Difficult to find item
review/text: Like others, I'm trying to use more whole grains in my cooking. Farro makes a nice addition to the pantry; however, it is difficult to find. I ordered this item on Amazon. The first bag had been packaged poorly by Amazon and it was torn open in the shipping process. I ordered a replacement bag, which was packaged better. I like Farro and I'm glad that I had a chance to try it. I'm not sure if I'll risk ordering through Amazon again. I'm going to search for Italian markets for Farro.

review/text: I am still somewhat new to using Agar Agar, however, am extremely happy with it.  Eden's Agar Agar flakes are excellent and have zero calories.<br /><br />There are many recipes that you can use Eden's Agar Agar with, and I encourage you to do an online search.  Get creative and have fun!  Personally, I have been making my own zero-calorie jello with this - except my zero calorie jello is all vegan and has no chemicals what-so-ever.  I've been taking organic lemon juice (not lemonade... lemon juice), water, and liquid stevia (sometimes I choose orange liquid stevia).  I mix in the agar agar flakes (as described on the back of the package) and my end result is an all-natural, zero-calorie, vegan jello dessert which is quite tasty.<br /><br />There is another brand of Agar Agar flakes on Amazon that has 30 calories per serving (why, I do not know), so be weary of other brands.  Be sure to check out the label. The Eden brand is pure agar agar.  It is fantastic and I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Great alternative to gelatin
review/text: This was my first time using Agar agar which I discovered in a chocolate mousse recipe without eggs. This Agar Agar works perfectly at solidfifying food. It liquifies when brought to a boil for A FEW minutes and solidifies when cold. The first time I was too quick and not all the agar had disolved, leaving some unpleasant crunchy bits. So, just make sure you keep the agar agar boiled long enough so that it completely liquifies. Doing this will produce great solid mousse and jellies. It is a great product because it is really tatsteless. It only does the job of solidifying food but does not alter its taste at all.

review/text: When I got back from Paris I thought I would be able to find some good goat cheese at specialty shops, but all I could find was the tubs of goat cheese that haven't been aged and basically just tasted a little different than cream cheese.<br /><br />This goat cheese really reminded me of the stuff I could get in paris.  Leave it out for 30 minutes and put it on some toasted baguette and it makes a great snack, or even a meal with a salad, tomatoes, and wine.  You can really tell it has been aged by the flavor especially near the white rind.  I got the presidente stuff in paris that was in little log shapes with a white rind, which was really good, but I think this is even better.  Bon appetit!

review/summary: High Mountain Gourmet.  Food of the Gods.
review/text: Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa.<br /><br />The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.<br /><br />In that maiden purchase I also added lavender and clove essential oils to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, and lavender tea.  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here.<br /><br />I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment.<br /><br />If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, "nutrition" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of "yummy.").<br /><br />Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.<br /><br />The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to "gourmet it" accordingly.<br /><br />-- As "rice" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with "noodle heaven"; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).<br /><br />-- As "oatmeal" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, creme, that type of thing.<br /><br />As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:<br /><br />- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid ( water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa.<br /><br />-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12-15 minutes.<br /><br />-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Normally, a microwave cooks 4 times faster than "outside-the-waves" cooking, but, of course that time varies with larger amounts of food.  For example, 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8 -16 minutes.<br /><br />-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (�) cup liquid.<br /><br />I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate "lid"; zap it for another minute or half, then let it "steep" in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)<br /><br />In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.<br /><br />But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate "lid" I can just place it on the table for family style "digging in."<br /><br />I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!<br /><br />In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill, and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with those sellers, when/if the products are available on Amazon).  Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm very confident in ordering any item from them.<br /><br />Recently Berry Farm and Angelinas have been added to my list of healthful, gourmet food purveyors.  The reviews on Angelina's and Quinoa Red were helpful. In addition to the most common golden grain, I've only seen black Quinoa, which is also appealing, and is reportedly the oldest variety. Well, actually all the reviews I've read on Quinoa have offered something of value to the info I've already gathered. (I used to sell Quinoa in my CITY CHEF kitchen store, which is no longer open; I spend all my time writing now, with a little cooking on the side.)<br /><br />Quinoa has an iteresting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain:<br /><br />--  The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment's, like worms or parasites.<br /><br />-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.<br /><br />-- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the "naked" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions.  Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise-old-grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eons-younger food offerings.  I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre-washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available.<br /><br />Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).<br /><br />Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.<br /><br />I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of "health"?<br /><br />Here's an interesting question to ponder:<br /><br />Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had "lived" long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?<br /><br />For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024CW1O">Virgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.oz</a><br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books, including:<br />Molasses Moon

I usually drink very strong tea with sugar, no milk. But this truly rare Assam is a pleasure to drink also w/o sugar added. As I tried many different Assams in the past, I had a negative prejudice to the Assam teas (many of the Assams in the past were Chinese though, I guess). Because of the high price, I decided to take a risk - and was rewarded. I do hope that the next batch will be as good as the current one. My spouse is having a cup of tea every morning (the Revolution English Breakfast), I am confident she will like this rare Assam. The only problem here is its price. I may have hard time to keep on buying the Assam from India on a regular basis. Well, X-mas is coming soon. I might survive with the Special Rare Ceylon.

review/summary: Murky.  Darjeeling or Ceylon a better bet.
review/text: I wasn't very impressed with this tea, though I did manage to finish the tin.  People drink black tea (or 'red tea' as they call it in China) with milk and sugar typically, though I am happy to have some black tea without either prefering to enjoy the natural taste of the tea over the milk and sugar.  This Special Rare Assam from Taylors of Harrogate however, didn't really do it for me (either with milk or without).  It's worth noting that the flavor of a particular region's tea can vary between seasons.  A lot of sun in the fall tends to produce a 'sunnier' flavor with more subtly sweet aftertones, whereas a foggy rainy season before harvest tends to lend the tea a murkier flavor inclining towards bitterness especially when brewed strong.  That was my impression of this tea.  I've actually been to Assam which is only a day's travel from Darjeeling in the eastern Himalaya, and is at a considerably lower altitude.  Darjeeling is considered by most in those regions to be a superior tea, and all personal experience has led me to agree with this.  The only other Assam tea that I've had besides this product was some of the cheap powdered or ground black, which they commonly use to make chai - and which I bought while in Assam.  I found that to be a more refreshing cup even without the milk and spices, than this Taylors Special Rare (which I also drink without milk). Maybe it was just the season, but I honestly couldn't recommend this tea.

review/summary: Strong and flavorful
review/text: I tried this tea because many of my favorite teas have Assam as a main ingredient, in particular Earl Grey.  This tea does remind me of Earl Grey in flavor and aroma, only it has a more intense flavor.  If you like cream and sugar in your tea, this is a good match because it keeps a strong tea flavor without being overpowered (as some weaker black teas are). If you prefer light bodied teas like chamomille without cream or milk, this may not appeal to you.<br /><br />I have never had Taylors of Harrogate before now, but took a chance because I prefer loose tea to tea bags.  My local stores only sell two kinds of Twinings brand of loose tea, English Breakfast and Earl Grey. I prefer more variety.  This was a good buy for the price.  Since the tea is so intense, it doesn't take much to make a good cup.  I don't drink tea every morning, so this should last me a few months.  However, this would go a long way even for daily tea drinkers.<br /><br />I also recommend a one cup coffee maker for brewing loose tea (of course you can NEVER brew coffee in it or it will be ruined for tea).

review/summary: Tea from the Bramahputra Valley.
review/text: With an annual output of more than 1,500,000 lbs., the north-eastern Indian state of Assam - situated across the border from the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan - is the world's single largest tea-producing region. Similar to Darjeeling, Assam tea is picked in a first and second harvest or "flush." While leaves from the first flush produce a full, refreshing aroma, Assam tea is particularly known for its malty second flush, whose cream- or gold-colored tips (or even entire leaves) lessen the tea's natural bitterness, thus giving it a softer, gentler note.<br /><br />Among the best commercially available Assam teas is Taylors' single-estate Special Rare Tippy Assam, which has a rich, powerful aroma, is made exclusively from tips, and is very refreshing both when enjoyed in the morning and in the afternoon.

review/summary: You should try this even though it may not strike your fancy:  It's very good.
review/text: I've come back to tea after drinking coffee almost exclusively since before adulthood.  A huge part of the migration was, initially, due to that malady of modern life, acid reflux.  Caffeine makes me gullet go gaga.  In fact, I'm even reduced to drinking a blend of decaf and regular tea in order to keep the oesophagus happy.<br />A really cool thing about tea is that, unlike coffee, in its varieties there is a complexity of subtle (and not so subtle) flavors that one can easily apprehend.<br />Sure, there are people who will argue there is a whole range of flavor notes that can be found amongst the various coffee beans and while this is, strictly speaking, true, it is also pretty much true that one cup of good coffee smells and tastes pretty much the same as any other cup of good coffee.  Coffee is not the sort of thing one sips to enjoy as one would a glass of wine.  Drinking tea, on the other hand, can very much become a sipping game possibly because a tea leaf is more like an herb or flower than a coffee bean is.<br /><br />This is not to say that one can't find plenty of industrial strength tea with minimal flavor notes (e.g. many of the English/Scottish Breakfast tea blends, but see also Taylors robust yet flavorful S.A. Kwazulu that manages to deliver a mule's kick) and I love that kind of stuff and wish I could drink it because the decaffeinated stuff I've been reduced to is insipid in comparison.<br /><br />If you are just getting into drinking it, you're soon going to be touring the world of tea for different taste sensations, and likely flit from leaf to leaf before you find what makes for you the perfect brew.<br />This is DEFINITELY one of those teas you want to try on that journey for this Special Rare Assam Leaf Tea, Doomur Dulling, Loose Leaf tea is actually pretty special.<br />When you open the sealed bag it comes packed in you will likely first be surprised by the large size of the tips that comprise this tea.  They are so large the contents have the look of a pouch of tobacco (indeed, the stuff is nearly as fragrant as a pouch of newly opened pipe tobacco).  The next thing you'll do is smell them, no doubt, and note the fragrant, not quite heady aroma it exudes.<br />This fragrance and consequent flavor is what makes this tea singular.  After you have brewed it, stir in some sugar and milk, then taste it.  You'll immediately identify this as the so-called 'milk tea' drinks that the Japanese are so fond of and drink as a soft drink in much the same way that Americans in the South drink iced tea.<br />Its flavor is distinctive floral notes and may take you by surprise.  Doubtless, these floral notes and the delicacy of the liquor are what make this tea so desirable And may put off those who prefer the more common industrial strength blends.<br /><br />I find that I quite like this tea, and could possibly make it a daily drinker because it doesn't seem to cause that acid reflux reaction the broth-like teas I enjoy so much do.  Having said that, the pronounced fruit or floral flavor of the brew tells me that it may be something I drink for a can or two before reverting to the hearty (however feeble the decaffeinated version of the hearty is) brews I generally enjoy.<br />Actually, the English Breakfast Tea produced by 'Ahmad Tea' is one I highly recommend as a most delicious, full-floral-note flavored tea that brews up a hearty liquor.  It's the closest thing yet I've found that balances well industrial strength and high fashion flavor.<br />As for this tea, it is all high fashion flavor and, while I can't say that I love it, tastes real good.

review/text: this tea for me was one of my first two teas i tried that were loose. i was amazed at this change in flavor to bag tea. this tea is expensive but i enjoy it every few days. it does have a fruity flavor but it also has a deep heaviness that backs it up... you have to taste it to know it. anyway, i enjoy it greatly and would suggest it unless you like lighter teas.

review/summary: Closest Thing to a Caramel Macchiato In Instant Form
review/text: I love a Starbucks Caramel Macchiato but cannot justify plunking down cold hard cash for one on a regular basis, so I have often sought out new instant drink coffee products when they appear to see if I could find one that replicates the taste.<br /><br />This product comes pretty close...it even froths a bit at the top...it isn't the same as the foam in a Macchiato, but it works okay. If one had a little bit of whipping cream and some caramel to drizzle across this in a cup...I think you could really hit the imitation out of the park.<br /><br />I don't trust myself enough to actually have caramel around the house...so I have not tested it that way.<br /><br />Other fun points:<br /><br />You mix this in a 10 ounce mug instead of a smaller coffee cup which I like. I prefer to drink coffee beverages out of a hearty mug and many of these single serves are based on a restaurant style size coffee cup which leads to weak mugs. This is perfect in my standard promotional style mug.<br /><br />An extra perk is that this is a 100 calorie beverage packet which makes it far less damaging to your daily caloric bank than the "real thing."

review/summary: Decent Instant Coffee Drink
review/text: I got a free sample of the Nescafe Memento Caramel Latte through their Facebook page a while ago, and I finally decided to give it a shot this morning.<br /><br />I love caramel lattes, but it takes some time to make them for real at home and buying them at the coffee shop can get pricey, so I'm always on the lookout of a decent instant mix.  We have a Keurig Brewer at work and I used that for my hot water when making this (emptied packet into my mug and hit brew without putting in a K-cup).  I didn't pay attention to the brew size and ended up making this with 10 oz of water instead of the recommended 8 oz, so my latte was watered down a bit, but it still had a good flavor and was foamy at the top.  The description of this product says "Foam is so thick that a stir stick can stand on its own in the cup!".  While my drink did get foamy, I can't imagine it being that thick and foamy even if I had brewed it with the correct amount of water, but even for my watered down version it had a good amount of foam, so if made correctly it might be somewhat closer to that description, but I don't think it would get all the way there.  This seemed to have less caramel flavor than what I'd get at my local coffee shop.  Obviously a little bit of that is my fault for adding too much water, but it seemed like even if it was made with the correct amount the caramel to coffee flavor would have been a little weaker than a typical caramel latte.  The caramel flavor is definitely there, it just may not be as strong as what you're used to if you usually drink coffee shop lattes.<br /><br />Overall I'd say this is one of the best instant coffee drinks I've tried, but it is instant so you won't get the full coffee shop quality and flavor.  I'll be picking up some of this to keep in my desk at work for when I'm in the mood for a caramel latte instead of running to the coffee shop and paying a lot more.  I'm not sure I'd buy through Amazon though, the current price of $4.60 for a box ($0.57 per packet) seems a little high, I think I could probably find a better deal at my local grocery stores.

Since I was extremely exhausted and my exam was less than 3 hrs away I used my free sample to get a quick pick me up. Suprisingly it not only gave me the boost that I needed but it was delicious as well. Nice caramel flavor with a hint of coffee after taste. Even though I will NEVER be a full on coffee drinker this is something I would definitely buy for a quick pick me up during emergency situations.

I got a sample of this in the mail and was pleasantly surprised at how good this is.  I'm not even a coffee drinker.  And I don't usually like instant flavored coffee beverages of this typel I couldn't taste much if any coffee flavor.  This tasted to me more like hot cocoa mixed with caramel and cream.  I was expecting it to be too sweet for my taste but it wasn't.  Very good, and highly recommended.<br />I am at this moment preparing to buy more of this here on Amazon since I didn't find it at my local store.

review/text: I have just tried a sample of the Nescafe Memento Caramel Latte. I used my 8 oz cups to put about 6oz water in it. It is rich (not like another review said it is watered down)with foam on top.  It tastes just like the rich coffee house coffee. It has the delicious taste of Caramel and also smooth latte.<br />I tried to look for this in different grocery stores including Tom Thumbs (which Nescafe claims that they carry the Memento) none of them carry it.  This is not a good promotion if I can only buy this online! Come on, you expect people to like your product and buy it! I hope Nescafe can do a better job launching this new product so that we can buy some and enjoy it at home.

review/text: I received this as a sample. I'm generally a fan of Nescafe products, so I was expecting a flavorful drink. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />This coffee has a hearty flavor and is a shade better than International Coffees. It does have 100 calories per cup and is a bit expensive--though not as expensive as a daily cup at Starbucks or your favorite coffee shop. Personally, I wouldn't drink this every day but would probably save it for an afternoon when I need a boost.

review/summary: OK, but just a "cup of coffee"
review/text: A cup of store-brewed Starbucks Breakfast Blend has always been my favorite cup of coffee. Even when I brewed (regular brewing) it at home I couldn't get the quite same taste, but I could get close enough. Now that I have a Keurig brewer, I was excited to finally see Starbucks BB k-cups.... but, ouch, the price.<br /><br />For comparison, with my Keurig brewer, right now I like Tully's Extra Bold Breakfast Blend and Tully's Extra Bold Kona Blend, both of which I brew on the 2nd cup size (~7oz).  I've liked some other k-cups in the past, but they haven't been available on Keurig's site for a while.<br /><br />Anyway, I finally gave in and bought the (expensive!) Starbucks Breakfast (and House) Blend k-cups (from Keurig's site). Neither is like getting the same cup at Starbucks. I realize it can't be exactly the same, k-cup vs large brew. The Breakfast Blend k-cup is ok, I guess.  But it just doesn't have any of the complexity you taste in a cup from Starbucks. It's just "a cup of coffee".  I brew it on the 2nd (~7 oz) cup size on my brewer... smaller is too strong/bitter and larger is too watery.  To me, it's definitely not worth spending more on these Starbucks branded k-cups since I don't feel like I am getting anything close to the store brewed cup. Actually, I don't even like it as much as the Tully's BB mentioned above, so wouldn't buy the Starbucks BB even if it was the same price. Bummer.<br /><br />(FYI - For me, the Starbucks House Blend k-cup is undrinkable - it's too bitter (and I've tried brewing 3 different sizes, from smallest to travel mug).  It's just bitter regardless, with no underlying complexity of flavor. )<br /><br />Hope this helps someone, since obviously taste is very subjective!<br />c-

They didn't even bother to redo the packaging, just put in 10 instead of 12. Seriously, don't support this behavior. Shame on Starbucks!

review/text: I've never had Phad Thai in any form other than from my favorite Pacific Northwest restaurants that make it. This was absolutely delicious. It had a bit of a sweeter taste than what I'm used too, but that in no way was a bad thing. This costs about 20% of what I pay for the same dish and it's about half the portion size. When I get it from a restaurant it feeds me twice, so it's basically the perfect serving size for a grown man and it comes at a fraction of the price. I'll be ordering much more of this. You should too.<br /><br />P.S - I've ordered dozens of items off of Amazon. This is the first one I've ever bothered reviewing. It's that damn good.

review/text: As I work at Noodles & Co, I had the Pad Thai we made and loved it. After that, I was on a quest to find other variations or make my own.<br /><br />This brand happened to be the best in the few others I tried. It has a sweet taste to it, and the ground peanuts and baby corn give it a nice texture. The normal dish is actually spicier than this, but it is delicate enough for you to embrace the true taste of all other flavors such as the fish sauce and tamarind.<br /><br />Though, I admit the smell of it coming out of the microwave isn't that appealing, once you love this dish, it really wont matter.

review/text: I saw these on sale. Obtained for less than two-fifty per box.  6 of them.  Just ate the first.<br />Was leery as I smashed the compressed soft noodles and broke them apart with my hands for prep.<br />Cut open the sauce, dumped it on top, did not mix.  Microwaved for 2 minutes on high as instructed.<br />Took it out immediately, stirred it up, let it sit for a couple minutes.  It's good.  It's not pad thai<br />from the above average thai place for [...], but you gotta remember that this is a non-perishable<br />shelf item.  In the same genre as a canned good of sorts.  For that genre, this is an excellent food.<br />No fridge, no freezer needed, just find a microwave and your good.  Not sure of shelf life, but I imagine<br />many months if not years.  I will buy more.  This is something I could eat once a week if need be.  Serving size is good for a normal adult.  Less than 1/2 what I normally get at a thai place for serving, but this meal isn't for times where you are looking to score some quality leftovers.  It's quick, convenient, storage friendly, and quite good when it comes to quality and taste.

review/text: The noodles were super greasy out of the packaging and all in one big clump.  Unlike other brands, these noodles did not unclump after cooking and no amount of stirring broke apart a large chunk of them that tasted like a ball of greasy dough.  The sauce was pretty good but very thick and heavy for pad thai and had an artificially sweet taste (considering this is supposedly an "all natural" product).  It does not look at all like the image on the box.  For over 600 calories and 22 grams of fat I just don't think this brand is worth it when I could either have much healthier options from comparable brands or indulge in and enjoy real Thai food that tastes infinitely better. This wasn't terrible, but I definitely wouldn't spend my money on this product again.

Anybody who makes their own real Basil Pesto knows there are ONLY 4 ingredients in true Genovese Pesto: Pine Nuts, Basil, Olive Oil and Cheese (Parmigiano & Romano).<br /><br />While it sure sounds like a romantic real deal in the hyped description here with the "This natural pesto from coastal Liguria is made in the authentic Genovese style with fresh basil, olive oil, pine nuts and grated cheese".<br /><br />In FACT, the ingredients listed on the actual bottle also includes sunflower oil, sea salt, cashew nuts, garlic, wine vinegar, cornstarch and natural flavors. Oh, how unauthentic here!<br /><br />Buyer Beware! This pesto tastes as close to the real basil pesto as Hobo wine is to Grand Cru.

review/summary: My Favorite Pesto
review/text: Pesto Genovese is, without a doubt, my favorite pesto.  My family and I eat it on capelli d'angeli at least once every week.  We add a salad and a loaf of crusty Italian bread and the meal is simple but delicious beyond compare.<p>This brand of Pesto Genovese is one of my alltime favorites.  So many times, Peste Genovese can be too oily, covering up the taste of the basil and the pine nuts.  Not so with this pesto.  Every ingredient seems to be perfectly balanced so you get the freshest, most flavorful Pesto Genovese available.  The taste of the basil and the pine nuts is delicate, but so exquisite.<p>If you like Pesto Genovese or just want a change from more &quot;traditional&quot; tomato sauces, I urge you to give this pesto a try.  I don't think you can go wrong.

review/summary: good but stale
review/text: these snacks are very spicy and flavorful but the amount of corn oil used to make them leaves them tasting kind of stale. the package boasts freshness as they are made in usa, but they don't really taste that way. however once you open a bag its hard not to eat the whole thing because of they spicy bold flavor that can cover the corn oil flavor in a way. no expiration date printed on packages is annoying also.

review/summary: Great for Crostini
review/text: While Pesto Genovese is my favorite pesto for capelli d'angeli, my family and I love this pesto on crostini.  In fact, it's become a staple in our house and a regular at mealtimes.<p>Sun dried tomatoes tend to have more &quot;tang&quot; than other tomatoes and this pesto will certainly give your crostini added spiciness.  Don't get me wrong, you don't have to use this pesto on crostini alone.  That's just our favorite way of using it.  It would be great on pasta, too.<p>If you love tomatoes, especially sun dried tomatoes, I don't think you can go wrong with this pesto.  I recommend it highly.

review/text: I have purchased many gluten free baking products, but XO products are by far the best.  They have no after taste and really tastes like regular cornbread, cookies, brownies, or whatever mix you are using.  I made the brownies for my grandkids, and they loved them.  Easy to follow baking instructions.  I made the corn bread for company dinner, and they had no idea it was gluten free until I told them.  When is Amazon going to start actually selling this product so I can purchase online instead of going to the store.  Cannot wait for that to happen.

review/text: I served a double batch (2 packages in a 13x9 pan) of this Corn Bread at a family party and put some better on the side.  When I came back out a bit later to restock the table with additional food, it was already half gone and family members began asking for the recipe.<br /><br />I made it one other time and shared some with friends, one of whom had left it in her purse when she went to dinner that night.  They had corn bread at the restaurant, but she said it wasn't nearly as good as what I had given her, so she pulled it out and it right there with her meal.<br /><br />That should tell you something!<br /><br />This corn bread is easy to make and so satisfying to eat.

review/summary: A genuine bargain for a first-tier Italian olive oil
review/text: The fact that you are reading this review indicates that you are interested in olive oils that are a cut above the olive oil you are likely to find at a supermarket or a corner grocery store (unless you live in an Italian neighborhood).  You probably know, then, that olive trees do not tolerate frost well, so European olive oils come from southern Europe, from near the Mediterranean Sea, where frosts are infrequent.  You probably also know that the most highly regarded oils come from just south of the frost line, in the northern parts of that olive-growing region.  Finally, you know that top-level Italian olive oils fall into two distinct classes, the light Ligurian oils from near Genoa and the Italian Riviera, and the stronger peppery-finish oils from near Firenze and Perugia, in Tuscany and Umbria.  Within the latter group, some Umbrian oils are especially highly regarded, and the Italian government has established a D.O.P (protected geographical designation), "DOP Umbria," for Umbrian oils that meet the certification criteria.  All DOP Umbria olive oils are good:  there, I've said it.<br /><br />WITHIN the DOP Umbria designation, however, there are further subregions.  Many of us regard the olive oils from "Colli Assisi-Spoleto" to be the best of the DOP Umbria oils.  As its name suggests, the Colli Assisi-Spoleto subregion comprises olive groves growing along the lower slopes of the Apennines between Assisi in the north and Spoleto in the south, which is a fairly limited area; and the very heart of that area is the even smaller region close to the towns of Trevi and Foligno.  Some of the oldest known still-producing olive trees in the world grow in that area.  In fact, centuries ago, when the area was part of the Papal States, ruled by the Vatican, olive oil from Trevi was destined to go only to the Vatican; the Popes of that time wanted the best oil for themselves.<br /><br />Just as wine grapes have varietals:  cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir, etc., so do olives have cultivars.  In Tuscany and Umbria, most of the great olive oils come from three cultivars in particular:  Frantoio, Leccino, and Moraiolo.  Trampetti groves comprise all three cultivars.  However, as palates worldwide have become more sophisticated, demand has grown for 100% Moraiolo olive oils, and Trampetti makes a superb one:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YO8P6I">Trampetti Umbrian Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 17 oz</a>.  By diverting its Moraiolo olives to 100% Moraiolo extra virgin olive oil, Trampetti can get a higher price for that oil by itself that it can get for the same oil included within a blended cultivar product.<br /><br />But that leaves Trampetti's Frantoio and Lecino olives behind, and the importer of Trampetti olive oils, Ritrovo, has been the beneficiary.  Ritrovo imports a Trampetti oil that is made from Trampetti's Frantoio and Leccino cultivar olives, and that is the oil under review here.  The Trampetti olive groves are located right between Trevi and Foligno, in the very heart of the heart of the DOP Umbria region; but the Trampetti-produced olive oil under review does NOT have the "DOP Umbria" certification on its label; I do not know why.  However, this oil does have all of the taste of a top flight DOP Umbria oil.<br /><br />Now, before you get the idea that a Moraiolo-less oil is shabby, be aware that some of the most highly regarded Tuscan -- and Umbrian, including DOP Umbria-certified -- olive oils are made from Frantoio and Leccino olives.  Frantoio and Leccino olives can be the basis for GREAT olive oils.  These are oils that you dip freshly baked bread into to savor the oil's taste almost by itself.  These are oils that -- even without any other ingredients -- can transform a few leaves of fresh spinach into a wonderful salad.  We have seen friends drink these oils straight from a demitasse; they are that good (but if you try it be prepared for the peppery finish in the back of your nose).<br /><br />Among all of the top tier Italian extra virgin olive oils, the Ritrovo (Trampetti) Frantoio/Leccino extra virgin olive oil may be the best bargain.  For instance, if you compare this Ritrovo oil to the first class and excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QCU9R8">Capezzana Extra Virgin Olive Oil 2010 Harvest 100% Italian 500 ml Bottle</a>, you may find that you actually prefer the Ritrovo to the Capezzana; while it is equally true that you may prefer the Capezzana to the Ritrovo, the two oils very much play in the same league, and your preference either way cannot be sneered at:  degustibus non disputandum est.  But between these two very competitive first-tier olive oils, the Ritrovo is far more economically priced than the Capezzana.<br /><br />But take this as a warning to your pocketbook:  Once you have this Ritrovo olive oil in your kitchen, your consumption of olive oil quite likely will spike; you will start putting this oil on and in everything.  You probably will consume a lot more olive oil with the Ritrovo oil in your kitchen than you ever have done before.  You have been warned!

review/summary: Sesame seeds: organic, raw, = great.
review/text: As others note these are the raw seeds unhulled. So that means toasting them is a must. Do that either in an oven or constantly stirred over medium heat in a dry frypan. Toasted and brown these are delicious, very full flavored and thick in texture enough to stand up in a lentil stew where I often use them. Also in salad dressings again they truly hold their crunch. Seems sesame is the universal flavor- used to love those sweet candies as a kid, now the flavor is expanded to all my dishes. Pair these with this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061XQMS4">Napa Valley Naturals Toasted Sesame Oil Unrefined -- 12.7 fl oz</a> and you have an incredibly rich combo, a dressing made from that is supreme.<br /><br />Sesame seeds contain an extremely valuable compound called sesamol- it has been linked to numerous health benefits including protecting the brain against Alzheimer's. A fact noted amongst many other medicinal uses - protecting against cancer, lowering blood pressure and cholesterol - in the great book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402776632">Healing Spices: How to Use 50 Everyday and Exotic Spices to Boost Health and Beat Disease</a>.

These will give you about 98% of your daily calcium in about 1/4 to 1/3 cup ground. They don't have the bitter taste that you get from tahini that you buy in the store. More people should look to this for calcium especially if you are vegan.

I make my own tihini by grinding up the seeds in the food processor.  The hulled work much better if you like raw tihini.  I don't have to add anything to the seeds.  It is a little thicker than the type you buy already processed but it is exactly like the raw tihini purchased fresh in the health food market. This product works as well but is much thicker and has more fiber.

review/text: I discovered this brand in July 2007.  My two terriers were always prone to digestive problems - gas, vomiting, diahrhea.  They both had asthma, allergies and chronic ear infections.  My vet told me that is just how the breed is and I spent thousands of dollars on vet treatments.  I felt so sad for my dogs, I began exploring health options on my own.  After much research, I found that nutrition can cause and cure many health ailments, including all those my dogs had.<br /><br />I researched a variety of brands, and began buying Wellness Lite - within a few weeks, my dogs were both healthier than ever.  It has now been 10 months and we've had no more health problems whatsoever - my only regret is that I did not find this brand sooner!

review/summary: Seems better for the owner rather than the dog
review/text: We recently adopted an obese pet and were looking for healthy dog food that could help him lose weight. The ingredients seemed great, but this food made our dog vomit daily and have very soft bowel movements 5-7 times per day! The food did little to help with weight reduction (even with all the vomiting), and we eventually had to switch to a veterinarian-prescribed food instead. (Note: Our dog does not have a hypothyroid problem.) After we stopped feeding our dog this brand of dog food, his stool has become firmer and less frequent, and he is no longer vomiting on a daily basis.<br /><br />As I stated above, the ingredients seemed very healthy and nutritious, but I would not feed this to my dog or recommend it to anyone else.

review/text: So glad I could find this on Amazon. Saved more than $10.00 off of regular retail price at all of my local pet stores. My dog has been sick, in part due to regular name-brand dry foods. Too many additives and by-products hidden behind a "healthy" label. Wellness allows me to feed my dog food that will not make her sick. I can pronounce the ingredients and she loves the Healthy Weight Recipe, despite it being a "diet" formula. As a dog living with colitis, limiting fat and increasing fiber intake is vital to her IT health. This food makes it easy and she still regards it as a treat six months after starting to eat it in her bowl. She is a finicky eater, and I have spent hundreds of dollars on various "diet" foods from the vet and pet boutiques. This was the first formula she liked right out of the bag. What a relief! Five star product!

review/text: Our 7�-year-old and 2-year-old dogs have been on Wellness Super5Mix Healthy Weight Recipe Dog Food for almost 3 weeks at the time of this review. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the bag for the first time -- I was not greeted by that all-too-familiar and cringe-worthy dry food smell that you get from other brands. The kibbles are little triangles and pale yellow in color. I love that the 26-lb bag is also resealable.<br /><br />Because this food was designed to fill doggy bellies the right way, I learned quickly that I didn't need to adhere to typical portion sizes for our dogs. The 7�-year-old is a 92-lb Rott/Shep. Given her size, the recommendation is 4 cups a day. This serving size is not needed in our case with this food. She eats 2� cups at dinnertime and is very happy. She doesn't poke around the food bag or tip her bowl over as a request for more. Our 2-year-old is a 40-lb Chow mix that is as skinny as her breed comes. She eats 1� cups (sometimes less) and walks away when she's done, occasionally leaving a few kibbles for her sister to finish up.<br /><br />Both dogs have also not skipped any meals the way they used to when they were on a different brand of food. They now eat every evening without fail, and I've not had to throw out uneaten kibbles. I also recently noticed that their breaths actually smell cleaner.<br /><br />Thank you, Wellness, for making excellent products for our furry kids!

review/summary: Best low-fat dog food!
review/text: My dog had gotten Pancreatitis (no reason why) but had already been eating the regular whitefish Wellness bag so we switched to this low-fat blend b/c Pancreatitis can be caused by too much fat in a dogs diet (make sure you look at the fat content in any brand you buy) and it's working out great!  It's a great blend and brand for the price!

review/text: Excellent food with first ingredient being deboned chicken.  My border collie loves it and is doing well on it.  It was delivered quickly and Amazon's price was better than anywhere I had ever purchased from.  I also didn't have to put it in a cart, push it to my car, transfer it from the car to the kitchen.  Came right to my front door.  Thanks Amazon for such great service.

review/summary: Truely healthy dog food
review/text: If you have never investigated what is in your dogs food, and you think it is all about the same...READ THIS !<br />All dry dog food is NOT good for your loved pet, and it is NOT the same.  MANY major brands of dog food, including most that are sold at local grocery stores are not good for your pet.  Yes...they will survive on them...and yes...they might like the taste, but investigate !  Useless calories, fillers of cereal husks, and other trash are typical ingredients....and....the PRIMARY incredients.  Wellness...and some other brands....all of which will cost you more than the cheap brands, are made with chicken, lamb, or other animal products as their MAIN incredient, which will be the FIRST one listed on the label, by law.  With added antioxidents, vitamins, and joint compounds, these premium foods will extend the life of your pet.  Feeding them the cheap food is like feed your child McDolnald's bugers 3 times a day, with all the desserts they can eat.  They will live, but you are killing them slowly.  Our dig loves her Wellness food, and I feel better knowing I am doing the best I can for her.  Does you dog deserve any less?

review/summary: Sadie Loves It
review/text: We started Sadie on Wellness White Fish and Sweet Potato formula, which she loved.  But it gave her gas and she had 'fish breath' after she ate.  So we switched to the Healthy Weight formula and she transitioned very well.  And it cured the gas and breath problems too.  Although she is at a good weight, we will continue with this formula because she really likes it and since I use individual kibble as a treat for good behavior, I don't worry that she is getting over fed.  I would highly recommend this formula, regardless of whether your dog has a weight problem or not.

review/text: Pugs are NOT finicky eaters - still mine gobbles this up and loves it as much as any food I've tried on him. He weighed 18 lbs. when I first started him on this and reminded me of a fat little sausage. He has almost finished one 26 lb. bag and has lost 3 lbs. and is holding at a steady 15 lbs. now. I feed him 1/4 c. in the morning and 1/3 c. in the evening. And....2 - 3 times a week I give him a "treat". The food does what is supposed to. Vet says he couldn't be healthier!

review/summary: Perfect for both overweight and healthy weight dogs
review/text: Our puggle's weight had ballooned to almost 40 pounds--at least 10 pounds too heavy--and we weren't willing to feed her a low-quality food full of by-products and weird stuff after making the switch to holistic foods a few years ago. Just three months after starting on Wellness Healthy Weight, she has shed several pounds and is well on her way to being at her ideal weight again. Our other, healthy-weight dog has also been eating this food without any noticeable weight gain or loss and without having any food allergy flare-ups. The best part is that both dogs love the food, and they are both picky, picky eaters. If you're looking for a high-quality, no-filler holistic food to help your lazy, treat-filled pooch lose some of those extra pounds, give this one a try.

review/summary: Made my dog sick
review/text: I was feeding my dog the Complete Wellness but decided that she needed to watch her weight so I started feeding her this weight one. She started vomiting daily. I figured it  was probably the food since it started happening right around the time we got her on the new one. I took her to the vet just in case and the vet agreed that I should stop feeding her this food and put her on a bland diet for 5 days. Once she stopped eating this food, she was fine. I'm going to be switching her to a new brand because I'm hearing some sketchy things about Wellness.

review/summary: Dog says not tasty
review/text: I recently ran low on Castor & Pollux Organix Adult Less Active Canine Formula Dry Dog Food and it was unavailable with Prime shipping at the time, so I ordered this brand.  I've been mixing the two together to increase my dog's acceptance, but she now has not eaten for three days straight.  I suppose that is an alternate strategy for weight reduction, but neither of us is happy, and the food was really expensive.  My dog does not recommend this dog food. She preferred the Organix.

review/text: This is not the water-down stuff sold as honey in the US.  It is THICK and incredibly flavorful.  When I visited Australia about ten years ago, I went so crazy for it that I brought back a suitcase full!  Just a small amount is all you need to flavor your tea or put on bread.  A bit of this with some peanut butter will put you in foodie heaven.  It's good even with butter for breakfast.  Honestly, just try a jar.  You'll be hiding it from the rest of your family!

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: Wow! This really hurts me to do this, but I have to give this syrup the lowest review it has gotten yet. This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.<br /><br />I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat. Perhaps it'll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if you're going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, there's a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon.

Time to search again... &lt;grin><br />Forgor to mention -- definitely grade "A" Fancy -- not grade "B" (the cooking grade).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HI556E">Hidden Springs Maple Vermont Maple Syrup, 1 Quart - Fancy Grade - Light Amber</a>

review/text: Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup is excellent!  There isn't anything on the label that states that this is from anywhere else but Vermont...(some syrups that claim to be pure maple syrup also have labels that state that they may be a product of Canada or Vermont).  The price per oz. is about 81 cents and as I use at least one ounce on my waffles, this bottle will last for about 16 servings.  I will be buying this one again!

review/text: Living on Guam can at times leave much to be desired. We were sitting here talking about when we visited our family in Wisconsin and had some home made ice cream at an Amish farm. I remembered how good it tasted and I remembered I had some Maple syrup ice cream while there, sooooo. I got on line and found this 1/2 gallon, price wasn't bad  (here at a local store a pint of REAL Maple syrup will cost $12.00) and it had free shipping. I had it in a few days, and made the ice cream right away. By the way I also made pancakes and sausage for dinner, and this here Maple syrup was as good if not better than what I had 8 years ago. VERY well packaged, and really fast shipping. Nice bouqet, great light amber color, great job to the cooker. Oh yea, by the way, the ice cream came out wonderfully.
