review/text: I was looking for a good powdered eggnog mix like the one Kroger used to sell a few years ago.  It was very creamy rich with an excellent egg and rum flavor.  This McSteven's Holiday Blend Eggnog is pale and watery with a strong nutmeg taste.

review/summary: Egg nog year round!
review/text: I love egg nog! I would put it in my cereal ... if it made sense. lol Anyway, this stuff is not like real egg nog - which tastes more like melted ice cream and is probably much less healthy. But McSteven's Holiday Blend is good - especially if I add a little coffee creamer to it. I do mix it with boiling water, although you could mix it with hot milk or cream if you are so inclined. I guess you could even add eggs and sugar, but then ...<br /><br />Nah, it's egg nog. And I like it. And it won't go bad on you, even in the middle of summer. YUM!

review/summary: Please be aware that this is an eggnog powder/mix and not a ready-to-drink eggnog
review/text: I saw the tin and quickly bought it, thinking it was a ready-to-drink eggnog.  IT IS NOT.  Also, a cursory review of the product description did not lead me to believe it was a powder/mix.  I think the company may have meant to use the description "blend" (and other references to "Cocktail Mixers" on the same page as the product) to let the customer know it was a powder/mix.  However, the description "blend" does not necessarily mean a powder/mix to everyone.  Also, other references to "Cocktail Mixers" may have been on the page with the product (for example, at the bottom of the "Product Details" section it shows the product is listed under "Cocktail Mixers"), however a "Cocktail Mixer" reference does not necessarily mean the product is a powder/mix (and some cocktail mixers I have previously bought could be consumed as a ready-to-drink mixer with the option to be used for a cocktail).  Regardless, before I purchased the product, I did not--and other customers may not--see such a "Cocktail Mixer" reference.  I would have wanted to know that this product is an eggnog powder/mix (and NOT a ready-to-drink eggnog) before I purchased it.  Maybe if the company were to add a "Product Description" section and clearly state this is a powder or mix (and not a ready-to-drink eggnog), it would keep other customers from misunderstanding.

review/summary: Very Good Sliced Ripe Olives, and A Lot Of Them.
review/text: I enjoy shopping at Costco and I can't seem to resist certain impulse items. This week I picked up a 33-ounce plastic bag of Lindsay Sliced California Ripe Olives. Now, what am I ever going to do with all these sliced olives? Well, they taste quite good so that will help. They can be used with a lot of other things or eaten as a snack. They'll keep for a long time in the fridge. I'll get good use of them, I'm sure.<br /><br />The olive slices come tightly sealed in a tough plastic bag. About 3/4 of the contents of the bag are the olive slices and the rest is a packing liquid just as you'd find in a jar. Be careful when you open the bag. You also might find a sealable container to put the contents in after you open the bag. Keeping them in the bag doesn't work too well. In any case, they're very good ripe olives and there's a lot of them. Enjoy!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: It's been a while
review/text: I was born in the early 90's and i used to buy one of these everyday after elementary school on my way home. they used to be smaller back then. A 6 piece 5 cents, 12 10cents, and a very long one about 25cents(i believe it's the one in this package). I bought this as a way to remember my childhood and just enjoy a good candy.<br /><br />If you remember eating these when you were younger i would definitely recommend this, but (there's always a but) I do feel the price for Shipping and handling is too high. I payed double the price that it came out to be ($9 plus $8 for S&H). it is because of that I gave it 4/5 if the S&H was atleast cut in 1/2 5/5 on the dot.<br /><br />**Warning- if you do get this don't eat too many too soon. It will actually give you a sugar rush, and sugar (burn??) on your throat. These are meant to be a small snack once in a while, not an actual meal >_&lt; learned this the hard way...<br /><br />Pros- great candy snack, brings back memories<br />Cons- Shipping and Handling might kill your wallet :(, and if eaten too many (5 or more) might make you sick.

review/summary: Pretty Lame Chewing Gum
review/text: Eclipse is a rather lame sugarless gum and has a rather rubbery consistency.  I have chewed through several packs of different Eclipse flavors and this gum just doesn't do it for me.  The pieces are kind of small so I chew two at a time and the flavor lasts all of  five seconds leaving you with just this rubbery, not very fun to chew gum in your mouth.<br /><br />If you like Spearmint the very short lived flavor is pretty good but it disappears too fast to enjoy it.<br /><br />I probably will try other brands of sugarless gum.  Eclipse just doesn't do it for me.

review/text: As far as chewing gum goes, it's hard to beat Eclipse.  The only problem when ordering it in bulk like this is the temptation to see just how many pieces you can chew at once.  If you don't have a spouse or significant other who can act as a voice of reason, I recommend that you stick with purchasing single packs.  If you do have someone that will prevent you from chewing it all at once and suffering from an embarrassing emergency room visit, then by all means purchase away!

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: I got off the chewing gum kick many years ago.  The reason?  Putting something in my mouth for several minutes that contained sugar.  I'm as fond of my teeth as the next guy, so I ditched the chewing gum to protect them--but I missed the chewing habit.<br /><br />Then one night following some adult beverages a friend of mine introduced me to ECLIPSE SUGAR-FREE GUM, and I've been smacking and popping ever since.  I especially like the Spearmint flavor; it's delicious, and you would never know by the taste this product is sugar-free!  Another reviewer mentioned the flavor doesn't last long, and while that is true, as I only chew for a few minutes anyway it works out perfectly for moi.<br /><br />I normally chew gum following lunch before returning to work, so chewing ECLIPSE SPEARMINT SUGAR-FREE GUM immediately freshens my breath and makes the onions or garlic or salad dressing I just had a distant memory.  Plus my teeth are happy, too!  Now if this gum would just whiten teeth it would indeed be a perfect world.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

review/summary: Little Packets of Fruit Chewies. Quite Good.
review/text: On the "Specials" shelf at my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market, I found a box (net wt. 8 ounces) of Ocean Spray Fruit Snacks. The box contained 10 smaller packets (0.8 ounces) of snacks made with real fruit juices and natural flavors and colors. Each of the packets contains about 8 pieces of  things that resemble Gummy Bears, but are softer and easier to chew. The flavors (Strawberry, Grape, Cherry and Mixed berry) are quite good. I guess one packet amounts to 80 calories and provides 100% of the daily vitamin C. Well, that's interesting. I thought they might be used as treats for my little boy (about 4-years old), and I think they'll do splendidly.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: A taste worth acquiring
review/text: I've always loved dark chocolate, so when I saw this I had to try it. It took a little getting used to-I don't cook with it, I just eat it, but once I got used to it, it was the most intense chocolate I had ever had. Dark chocolate is in the news these days-it has a lot of antioxidants and fiber and other compounds that are very beneficial. Chocolate is a plant food-it's just one that gets loaded up with sugar and milk and fat, so the health benefits are only to be found in the really dark stuff, like more than 70% cocoa. And what health benefits-preliminary studies are showing that dark chocolate can lower cholesterol and blood pressure and even increase insulin sensitivity, which can benefit diabetes and help a person lose weight. I was eating a little of this chocolate every day for my daily fix-it only has 70 calories a square, but now that it's not just an indulgence I get to feel good about eating it. And if you don't want to eat it, it's really good for baking-it's very smooth and melts and blends easily into whatever you're preparing.

review/text: Let me start out by saying I am no tea expert, my only comparisons are the usual major tea brands and restaurant bought tea.  So, from my experience, this is one of the best teas you can buy.  The sweetness does not taste like it came from a sugar pack, rather, it tastes like it is straight from a fruit and is not overwhelming.  The tea has a strong presence, but not bitter and bland.  It is like drinking something with many layers.  Although this is much better than soda, here is a comparison; the fizz of the soda is much like the tea (giving it some strength), while the sugar in the soda is much like the natural sweetness.  The fact that it is all natural and has many beneficial ingredients is simply icing on the cake.  This is a drink you can brag about to your friends.

review/text: I have always liked Special K.  Nowadays, it is all about brand extension.  So, they add some things to the basic cereal so you don't have to add your own banana or berries.  While I enjoyed the taste of the sample I was given, my advice is to go with the basic cereal and add your own fresh fruit.  The fruit here, and the box shows pictures of berries, is really made of apple pieces that are colored and artificially flavored to taste like some kind of vague berry taste.<br /><br />If you find adding your own fruit too troublesome, well, this is a good and tasty choice.

Frankly, I think it would taste better without them or with something else.  The yogurt pieces didn't seem to merge well with the cereal IMHO.  But then, that's why there's chocolate & vanilla.

review/text: I loved this great purchase at less than ten bucks, and they're M&Ms!  What's to say about them?  If you haven't had them, go out and buy a pack, they're a fantastic candy!  I prefer the ones with almonds best, but considering how cheap the milk chocolate version was, I wasn't going to pass up a great deal like that!  Thanks Amazon, I will keep coming back!

review/summary: Good Cold Shipping by Amazon
review/text: No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.

review/summary: I received my M&Ms just fine.
review/text: I ordered the 4 large bags. I received them in a timely manner and appreciated that they were shipped in a minimal amount of packaging. The four bags were simply shrink wrapped together and put in the box with my other items. I have only opened one bag so far but the M&M's were in great condition. Great price, delicious product, excellent service.<br /><br />Edit (10/01/10)- The price for these is now $35 more than when I bought them the first time. I can buy these for less than $10 a bag at the store. So the price is now closer to ridiculous then great.

I took these as a gift for a friend in Italy who hadn't been able to find them there.  I had to pull one out of my suitcase to get it back under the weight requirements and put it in my carryon, no problems with either.  My friend was delighted when they arrived and began snacking happily away immediately.

review/summary: **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************
review/text: First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats

review/summary: Pure Treat-making Chocolate withOUT hydrogenation
review/text: I am constantly on the lookout for "hydrogenated" (partially or otherwise) oils in my foods, and when I started making holiday candies for family last winter, finding baking chocolate was no different.<br /><br />I searched cheap brands like Nestle (whom I have humanitarian rights issues with anyhow) to the nicer brands like Ghiradelli, as well as the large blocks of chocolate bark in grocers' shelves.  Every single product except for this brand had hydrogenated oils, particularly in their white chocolate.<br /><br />So in addition to the reviewer who takes consideration to peanut processing, I like that this is hydrogenation-free.  It's the choice I make come the holidays.<br /><br />Best of luck in whatever chocolate you choose!

review/summary: Baker's is my Old Reliable
review/text: I always have a few boxes of Baker's chocolates in my cupboard. They give me reliable results, time after time; I have never had any of the issues I have (admittedly very rarely!) encountered with other brands, such as half of one block being missing, large air bubbles making the "one ounce" block more of a "3/4 ounce" one, and so forth.<br /><br />It breaks cleaningly and has nice 'crumble' in mid-processing, melts beautifully, and has good "plain old chocolate" flavor - no fancy 'with rosemary essence' or 'let's try adding five pounds of vanilla flavoring and charge double for it!' going on...fancier baking chocolates have their place too, and I do use them on occasion, but Baker's is my Old Reliable, always in the pantry, always ready to become a big old tray of brownies, a creamy chocolate pie, or a plate of "Mommy's Candy Store" candies for Easter.

review/summary: Great for the cats, a little messy for you.
review/text: I have a cat that thinks these things hung the moon, while the other one, well, he's just too good for them!  The bites are quite small so if you have a smaller cat like a Persian, they'll do just fine with these.  Persians have such tiny mouths that it can be difficult to find something they can eat but these fit the bill entirely.  However, my main complaint regarding these pouches is how infinitely messy they are to open and to serve.  Golly, I hate that gravy goo all over my hands!  No matter how hard I try, I always wind up with some of that smelly stuff on my hands and well, it takes quite a few washings to get rid of that nasty smell.  Other than that, they are a little pricey here - I pay about three dollars less at my local store that begins and ends with a t.  Not overly nutritious, however, so be sure to supplement these with something else. Great food, highly recommend!

review/summary: Convenient delivery, bad product
review/text: IT was wonderfully convenient to have cat food delivered to my home.  Unfortunately, there was something very wrong with this food.  I didn't even get through one box of it.  It made all three of my cats vomit repeatedly (and one of them, violently).  I thought maybe mine were too used to higher quality food, so I gave it to a friend who feeds a colony of feral cats.  So, get this, she called me the next day and said she put it out for the feral cats, who wouldn't touch it.  They all sniffed it, looked at her with disappointed expressions.. and walked away.  She thought maybe they weren't hungry just then.  She went inside and watched through the window.  They still didn't eat it.  She put it out near where a family of raccoons eat later in the evening.  And THEY wouldn't eat it, either.  She finally brought it in and threw it out.  There must have been something wrong with the food.  We threw out the rest of the boxes without checking the expiration date.  Hope that wasn't why it was so much cheaper than buying it at the store!

For years he's had repeated urinary issues and after dousing him with meds constantly, my vet and I came to the conclusion that he should not have ANY dry food whatsoever.  She also said to not give him any wet cat foods with fish.<br />I selected this brand because of all the extra liquid it has. I buy the poultry variety pack.  He loves it and since I started feeding it to him about a year ago, he hasn't had 1 single urinary issue.<br />It may not be grain free and all that, but sometimes you have to do whatever works....and this works.<br />Oscar is a happy camper and so am I!<br />;)

review/text: I purchased these to replace the one or two cans of cat food I feed my two very old cats to supplement their crunchy food.  They LOVE the Whiskas poultry combo flavors and seem to have an easy time eating it, but there are always one or two morsels stuck in the bottom of the pouch, and I sometimes get the gravy on my hands when squeezing the food out of the package.  I know there's not an easy way to empty these pouches, but when I'm on my way out the door to work, the last thing I want to do is wash stinky cat food off my hands.  Higher quality food than most canned, but more difficult to dispense than a can...

I ordered an 8 oz package, which is nearly done, so I must order more, and I experimented with it. I have it at work, where I like to sip some on cold days (7 degrees west of Boston this morning).  The best, most convenient way I have found is using a coffee press.  I put a (roughly) measured amount of leaves in the press, fill it with hot water, let it steep about four minutes, and pour it out into a Bodum double wall glass.  Stays warm longer and looks beautiful through the glass.  After writing this description, I think I'll go make another glass.  Live long and prosper...

review/summary: Chiles primo
review/text: These fire-roasted green chiles are exceptional. They have no discernible 'can' taste and the fire-roast flavor comes right through. I bought them here about a month ago for about a buck a pop...they're now going for twice that. I'm a bit surprised, but, maybe I got them on special. Nevertheless, try throwing these over some Santa Fe refries <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI701Y">Santa Fe Bean Co., Instant Southwestern Style Refried Beans, 7.25-Ounce Pack (Pack of 8)</a> and topping-off the lot with a dab or two of low fat sour cream and/or shredded sharp cheddar. You won't be sorry!

review/summary: Ooo, I hate to be a spoiler but......
review/text: ...these muffins are a big disappointment.  See that lovely BROWNED muffin top on box picture?  Welllll, I've tried several boxes of these, using different oven temperatures, making them plain, with fruit, with nuts, with everything I could think of except chocolate (hmmm, maybe I'll try that!)  The tops stay a pale, pasty WHITE!  Sooo unappetizing.  And false advertising, IMHO.<br /><br />Now for the taste.  Another disappointment.  They are bland bland bland, blah, blah, blah!  You MUST add additional ingredients or they are just plain, uh, RICEY tasting - and if you're an older celiac, you know what I mean.  Those first corporate attempts at making GF mixes were hideous!  These are no better.  Yuck!<br /><br />Now for the size.  I'm a pretty doggone accomplished baker if I do say so myself, both prior to my diagnosis in 1985 with non-GF ingredients, and since, using mixes and baking from scratch.  These just don't RISE!  See the photo with that lovely dome muffin shape?  Nuh-uh.  Perhaps they use old, REALLY old leavening?  Dunno.  But they puff up only about 1/16" of a centimeter.  Maybe.  But I doubt it.<br /><br />Now for the boxed ingredients.  Cheesh, you have to add all of the EXPENSIVE stuff to make these work.  Butter, milk, eggs, and fruit/nuts/whatever.  Fer cryin' out loud, it's truly no more trouble, and a WHOLE lot cheaper to make muffins from scratch.<br /><br />I desperately wanted to love these and give a great review.  But I just cannot.  Make your own muffins and save your hard-earned money for some of the Gluten-free Pantry's other mixes - I rate the following 5 stars without hesitation:<br /><br />Country French Bread mix - absolutely delicious!!  We use our bread machine and they come out PERFECT every time!  And when we've used regular oven, in our french bread loaf pans, we add some toasted sesame seeds, and they are incredible.<br /><br />Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix - OMG - completely addictive!!  Gotta watch out for these if you're on a diet.  You'll want to gobble up the whole batch!<br /><br />Beth's All Purpose Flour - quick & easy to use for all your baking (including those homemade muffins).<br /><br />Spice Cake and Gingerbread Mix - delicious - and sooooo easy - I can prepare it faster than it takes my oven to heat up.  (Isn't that one of the BEST reason for buying a mix?)  I add additional cinammon, nutmeg, ginger - we like it that way.<br /><br />Coffee Cake Mix - fantastic - and EASY - the crumble topping is included.  Wonderful for a breakfast treat and NOT just for Celiacs.<br /><br />So that's about it.  Try it - you may like it. Hey - that's what makes horse racing! But don't buy a whole case in the event that you don't.<br /><br />Regards to all you brave Celiacs out there.  Let's hope that someday science can find a solution for us to make our lives a little easier.  In the meantime, heaven bless these fabulous companies for providing us with these products.

review/summary: Yes, they do brown on top!
review/text: Having read the comments about these not browning, I cooked my first batch with the oven rack raised (2nd-to-top rack), and after waiting and watching, eventually found the perfect browned/done effect after about 25-28** minutes at 350 degrees. I use a jumbo-sized muffin aluminum pan, which makes 6 large muffins.  My muffins are beautiful and they taste as good as they look, but not too sweet. I follow the instructions to the letter (including stirring, not mixing, the milk and muffin mix at the end), with one exception: I add 1/4 tsp. more vanilla than instructed (3/4 tsp. vanilla instead of 1/2 tsp. vanilla).  Then I've added 3/4 c. fresh blueberries to a few batches and 2 mashed ripe bananas to other batches.<br /><br />All of my batches have come out of the oven picture-perfectly raised to a gentle peak and golden-brown, not too dry on the bottom.  They are light and fluffy on the inside, buttery and slightly crispy on top.  Mine actually look better than the box (in my opinion, see photo); they rise a little higher than shown on the box.<br /><br />These muffins do tend to stick to the muffin paper unless you let them cool, initially.  When re-heating, I microwave them for 30 seconds and then remove the paper; I don't know why, but with this method the paper comes off very cleanly.  When either fresh out of the oven or chilled, the paper sticks; they need to be slightly warm to avoid the paper sticking too much.  Sometimes after microwaving and removing the paper, I will lightly toast it in the toaster oven to give the top a little crispiness.<br /><br />This mix seems to be very accommodating to alterations, as others have mentioned.  I am thrilled with this product and will buy it again.<br /><br />**I found I need to bake them a few minutes longer, up to 30 minutes, when using frozen berries rather than fresh berries, and 25 min. is sufficient when making these plain.  I have continued using the second-to-top rack because that works beautifully.

review/summary: My son's favorite muffins!
review/text: These are my absolute favorite go-to GFCF muffins! At first I was put off by having to add the flavoring myself (having previously used Jiffy mixes), but now I like the ability to personalize the flavoring without having to stock dozens of different mixes. However, since my 9-y-o ASD son has texture issues, dried fruits are NOT an option for us (he just drops the fruit, or the rest of the muffin, when he comes to it), so I just measure 3/4 cup of all-fruit spread. Easy and versatile! I've also used fresh mashed banana and canned pumpkin. Even made it one time with just OJ instead of milk and no mix-ins (we were at my folks' and had already started mixing when we realized there was no GFCF milk); they were delicious that way, too!<br /><br />One tip I would like to share with everyone: Instead of mixing the whole package of dry ingredients and the whole cup of milk at once, mix like an old-fashioned cake recipe and alternate the dry & the milk. It makes the batter lighter and you get more muffins. (I average 22!)

review/summary: Best gluten-free baking mix out there
review/text: This is the best gluten-free baking mix out there.  The scones are an every-weekend treat for me.  Switch out different chopped nuts and dried fruits (orange-flavored dried cranberries make for an incredible scone) for unlimited variety.  A box makes 12.  I like to mix up the whole batch, make three (or four when I'm feeling extra piggy), and refridgerate the batter for later baking.  I prefer to shape the unused dough into a thick log, so I can cut off a few scones and bake over the next few days.  (I've never tried to extend it for longer than that.)<br /><br />This is one of those products that makes the wheatless life not bad at all.

review/summary: Fab mix for yummy GF scones & pancakes...
review/text: Please know that I've been GF for >10 years so my history is mostly making GF bakery items from scratch. That said, I was skeptical about this mix and bypassed it many times before giving it a try. Holy cows! am I gald I did try it. Yes, one must add a couple ingredients to complete the task - what's the problem with that? I like adding my own fresh ingredients and the idea that I can be as creative as I want with this 'box of scratch'.<br /><br />For me, I like using the mix for cranberry scones best of all. I prepare/bake the entire batch, eat what I want whilst warm and freeze the rest as they will dry out quickly. The scones that will be frozen I allow to cool and then wrap each one individually with foil and place in a ziplock bag. When I want a scone I just pull one out and remove the foil, wrap in a napkin and pop in the microwave for 20 or 30 seconds, or just allow to thaw in the foil to eat later.<br /><br />I have made beautiful chocolate chip muffins with the mix but prefer the scones much more. Although I never was a of lover pancakes or waffles (I guess because they made me sick) but I decided to try the pancake recipe on the box...who knew orange juice would be a good addition to a pancake recipe...I love the pancakes and make them often. This mix is very easy to work with and I'm happy getting it through the subscribe & save program because it is very economical and easy.

review/summary: So glad we found this
review/text: This is the best gluten free muffin mix I have been able to find.  My whole family is impressed, even the ones who aren't GF.  The mix also makes the best pancakes, gluten free mix or not.  We were all very suprised, and I've already bumped up our subscription to get more.<br /><br />I read a review that said the muffins didn't rise and didn't look like what was on the box.  I don't know if maybe they've changed the recipe since that was written, but our muffins have all turned out great, both the taste and the look.<br /><br />You do need to let them cool completely. If you just can't wait, you'll be scraping the muffin off of the cupcake liner.  I've made banana nut and blueberry.  The mix does say to add dried fruit, and I have used fresh or frozen fruit instead.  I don't know if that made a difference.  I haven't tried the scone recipe yet, but am looking forward to it.<br /><br />Of course, the cost is higher than mixes that are not gluten free, and you do have to add butter, eggs, vanilla, and milk, but I'm just thankful to have found something so good.

review/text: This mix makes nice chocolate chip muffins; they are a bit bland without the chocolate chips. I double the vanilla. For those customers with the browning issues: try lowering your oven rack, and baking a bit longer than recommended. With some experimentation, I now get nice golden brown muffins.<br /><br />These aren't super-easy for a mix - you need to add a fair number of ingredients. But they are tasty, and relatively simple to make. My kids like them a lot. They also freeze well.

review/text: I'm writing this, as much as anything, to point out what's on the back of the box.  There are recipes for muffins, scones, AND pancakes on the back of the box.<br /><br />Also, as much as you might love Gluten-free Pantry Mixes, if you have celiac and you're lactose intolerant as well (50% of us are)--this is one of the only mixes that you can buy.  (Avoid the bread mix or the quick mix--they have buttermilk and whey powder.)<br /><br />However, this doesn't have milk, buttermilk or whey in it, and you can even make pancakes with it.  Nice job.

review/text: I made these today for breakfast.  OMG they were so good!  I followed the directions on the package & used buttermilk.<br /><br />I added 1 cup fresh blueberries. To keep them from sinking I tossed them in 1/4 cup of the dry mix prior to adding.  I mixed them in last.  Also made a "crumbly topping" for them by mixing some GF Pantry flour, oats, chopped pecans, cinnamon & brown sugar.  Cut in enough butter to have the topping hold together when squished into a ball.<br /><br />Add this topping to the top of the muffin batter.<br /><br />I used the extra large muffin tin and got 6 muffins.  They browned nicely and had a nice crumb feel to them.  Very easy to make.<br /><br />The muffins rose nicely and tasted divine.  I will definitely keep this mix around.<br /><br />Can't wait to try the scone recipe.

review/summary: Brown lovely when you bake them just a little longer - Delicious!
review/text: We now have another gluten-free hit! We don't have to avoid gluten, but I'm trying to cut down on gluten for myself and my family.  We're big fans of Gluten Free Pantry's cornbread mix (which I usually make as muffins, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVE3Y4">The Gluten-Free Pantry Yankee Cornbread Mix, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>), and I just tried this muffin & scone mix.<br /><br />I have guests coming for the weekend, so the first time I used this mix, I made a double batch (2 boxes at once), for a total of 24 regular sized muffins. This mix is perfect for adding your own fruits or nuts. I added the recommended 3/4 cup per batch of fruit (dried cranberries) and a dash of lemon oil extract. Boy did these muffins turn out great!<br /><br />The directions say to "bake 16 minutes or until cake tester comes out clean". After 16 minutes, the muffins looked done, but they weren't browned on the top at all. I put them in another 3 minutes, tested one (by eating it) at its new slightly-browned-top stage (yum); then put the rest in for another 2 minutes for a nicely mostly-browned top. After the extra 5 minutes of cooking, the muffins are not dried out or overdone. They are delicious. Everybody's oven is different, but if you try this mix and they aren't browned after the recommended baking time, you may be able, like me, to leave them in longer without any negative effect on taste or texture.<br /><br />We have a diabetic in the house, so counting carbs is important. If you make 12 muffins from one box of mix, and use whole milk, one muffin has 30.9 carbs.<br /><br />The box also has directions for making scones and pancakes from this mix.<br /><br />So far I've tried two Gluten Free Pantry products, and I am very happy with both of them.

review/summary: my new favorite muffin mix
review/text: I love this product.  I always substitute applesauce for the melted butter, initially because I didnt have 6Tbs of butter on hand, from then on because it worked fine and seemed a bit healthier.  I also always add a generous sprinkling of flax meal in the mix (half cup or so?).  My muffins always come out with nice rounded, golden brown tops and a decent texture.  I have found that I do have to cook them longer than the recommended time (usually around 25 min).  I have made many delicious variations- apple with butterscotch chips, chocolate chip with orange and cinnamon, blueberry with lemon peel, apricot with almonds.  This mix provides a quick and easy base for all these variations.  I will definitely buy it again and recommend it to anyone, gluten free or not.

Used Greek yogurt instead, in the same amount, but added a tablespoon of orange juice to thin it. Before baking, I added a little more OJ to the leftover yogurt to spread on the tops, then sprinkled each with a tiny bit of organic sugar. I also made them larger than recommended and got eight nice sized scones. Like all scones, they were just a bit crumbly, but these were not dry like many scones I've had.<br /><br />They were a hit with my family, so I'll definitely be making them again. And I'll try adding other ingredients. Orange zest and sliced almonds, or blueberries, or shredded sharp cheddar, or crumbled feta cheese and chopped olives...

review/summary: As close to the real thing as you'll get going gluten-free
review/text: This is a fantastic mix.  Many of the GF Pantry mixes are excellent, and this one is in my top five, along with their Brown Rice Pancake and Waffle Mix.  During the summer when it's too hot to bake, I make these 3-at-a-time in my toaster oven and they come out just as good as if I used the large oven.  These are the best tasting scones I've ever made that are gluten-free. They are very, very close to the real British scones you'll get at the tea shop or in your local bakery.  Unlike other gf mixes, I find that these have staying power beyond the first 24 hours.  If you refrigerate in an air tight container, just pop them into the toaster oven for a quick warm up before serving and they are just as good as when you baked them. I buy them by the case now and have never been disappointed.  I also like to add a tsp. of lemon or almond oil purchased from King Arthur Flour baking company. If you are a scone fan and have been diagnosed with celiac or with a grain intolerance, feel deprived no more! This is well worth the purchase. Happy Baking!

review/summary: Best Scones Ever-Gluten Free
review/text: I've never been a scone person, but when I found out I had an allergy to wheat, I was on the hunt to fulfill my need for bread products.  I decided to try the Gluten-Free Pantry's Muffin & Scone mix, and I'm so glad I took the chance.  Although overpriced, the scones have a fluffy and crunchy texture.  I add cranberries and pecans.  The box says it makes more than it really does. I get about 7-8 hand sized scones from the mix.  They don't last long, however.  Neighbors, family, friends scoop them up.  They're buttery, and delicious, and great with jam.  Enjoy!

review/summary: great muffins
review/text: These muffins are very easy to make dairy free.  Substituting oil for butter and orange juice or rice milk or soy milk for milk works great.  I add chocolate chips or blueberries.  Excellent.  Everyone loves these - even my friends and family that do not follow a gluten-free diet.

review/summary: Great Muffins!
review/text: I just made these muffins for the first time. I used chopped dates and pecans. Now I need to make another batch because everybody else in the house ate them-and they are not even celiac!

review/summary: Great muffin mix
review/text: This is the best gluten free muffin mix I have tried.  You can add anything to the mix and it holds up well.  One of my fav's is adding diced apples, raisins and cinnamon.  Of course blueberries are great too.  They are not gritty at all and are good even after a few days if kept in a sealed container or bag in the refrigerator. Just pop them in the micro for 20 seconds and they are great! They freeze very well too.

review/summary: The Kids Love These
review/text: These are incredibly delicious. If you think that you can't have a Gluten Free muffin and have it taste delicious, you are wrong. The GF Pantry mix is great. Not only is it incredibly easy to make it bakes well and consistently. We have made the muffins plain and with add-ins (Blueberries, peanut butter) and every time they tasted great!<br /><br />This is a must for those on the Gluten Free Diet

review/summary: FANTASTIC!
review/text: This is truly a great versatile mix.  Substituting oil for butter and rice milk for regular milk works out perfect.  Using orange juice for the milk makes great pancakes and muffins as well.  The options are endless for muffins- our favorite is adding a bit of cinnamon and GFCF chocolate chips.  I also sneak in small amounts of light colored pureed veggies (baby food).

review/text: I really have no idea how this product has so many positive reviews.  It tastes like cardboard.  I've tried fruit, nuts, poppyseeds and even chocolate.  Nothing makes these taste better.  I've very thankful that I got these on the clearnace rack at the grocery store (although now I know why they were on clearance!)

review/summary: Real food (not mush)
review/text: I love feeding Tiki Cat to my little pet because it looks like real food.<br /><br />This stuff is real shredded chicken, not the paste you get in Wellness and all those other brands. It just makes me feel better (though Kit is pretty easygoing on this front, and eats anything I give her).<br /><br />Two thumbs up from me.

review/summary: Appears to be good food, but cats didn't like it.
review/text: I have 4 somewhat finicky cats.  They really liked a few of the Tiki Cat flavors (Waimea Luau - Tuna on Rice with prawns, Honolulu Luau - Tuna on rice w/ Crab Surimi), but this was not one of them.  It kind of surprised me since in other brands of cat food, Chicken is usually one of their favorite flavors.  The chicken itself looks like just plain shredded cooked Chicken instead of the nasty loaf stuff that is in most cat foods.  I like the fact that this food has no "meat by-products" and the ingredients are simple.  However, I was surprised that the food is a product of Thailand - not sure if that is necessarily bad, but just something to be aware of.  Their website has more information on the safety precautions they take -> [...].  I also like the fact that they have the IATTC Dolphin Safe Certification.  So, if their claims are true, then this should be a pretty safe and high quality food. The trick is to get your cats to eat it.  For me, I will not get this particular flavor again, but will probably continue to get some of the others that my cats seemed to like.  There is a Tiki Cat sampler pack available on Amazon -> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1Y150">Tiki Cat King Kamehameha Luau Variety Pack Canned Cat Food</a> if you'd like to try out the different flavors to see what your cat likes before buying in bulk.  Unfortunately, the sampler pack did not include many of the flavors, so I ordered an 8-pack of the Napili and Puka Puka Luau flavors, which my cats won't seem to eat.  I am very curious to try some of the other flavors, but probably won't do so unless they come out with some more sampler packs, as I don't want to buy the food in bulk and then have to give it away when my cats won't eat it....

review/text: My cats are obsessed with Tiki Cat!  They beg for it several times throughout the day.  It has a great ingredient listing.  I believe that it has to be one of the most natural canned cat food available.

review/summary: My cats love it!
review/text: I was thrilled to discover Tiki Cat, as I was looking for healthier food for my cats. They don't like many of the "healthy" brands, but they LOVE Tiki Cat! The chicken is one cat's absolute favorite, and he has started insisting I give it to him regularly. He likes any of the Tiki Cat brands with chicken in it, but prefers the Succulent Chicken. My other cat prefers their seafood, but enjoys the chicken too. I feel good feeding them this brand. Chicken and chicken broth are the first two ingredients. This is human grade food, made from all natural ingredients (with added vitamins and minerals). If you are new to Tiki Cat, try the sampler packs. Or some stores will sell individual cans. The Natural Pet Market in Wheaton, IL sells cans individually, and you can call them to make up a sampler for you with flavors you request.(They ship.) I hope this food makes your cats as happy and healthy as it makes mine!

review/text: I like this item very much. I am hoping it has the same nutritional value as the canned....yes I did say canned as opposed to fresh as advised in Dr. Budwig diet of drinking a few tablespoons of asparagus juice daily to keep cancer away.  I love asparagus and this is just a fine replacement.  I have found I can even add some to egg salad without overpowering it. I can also sneak it into salad dressing as an emulsifier instead of mustard.  It has a myriad of uses ...soups, stews...anywhere anything!  Not a very strong asparagus taste...the more you use the more pronounced the flavor.  I've bought the Kaiser shake n spice shaker to sprinkle it  on my food ...handier than the bag it comes in.  The Kaiser brand has a cap which is why I bought it but any shaker will do.  And it mixes well with flax seed oil.  I had a salad with this yesterday eve and all night and this morning my mouth has been in  heaven and my stomach happy.

review/summary: Foundation for fusion dishes
review/text: This rice is wonderful, and I love using it out of the container instead of rice that comes in a bag or a box. This rice is different from any other rice I have cooked with. The obvious comparison is Indian basmati rice -- long grain, fragrant, tasty -- but Texmati is not quite basmati. That means that Texmati is not perfect for Indian food, but it also means that it is really good. Actually, this Texmati is more flexible than classic basmati rice. You can use it with Chinese or Korean dishes. It works great in your favorite rice casseroles. I like to cook it in our ricemaker, then flavor it by adding a few fresh or frozen peas, a shake of our favorite herbs (dried basil, dried New Mexico oregano), and a swirl of olive oil mixed with Hungarian paprika. Or stir in a little finely chopped cilantro and parsley. I like to finish my serving with a sprinkle of ground red chile flakes. Now we're talkin' fusion. Texmati is a great foundation for fusion dishes based on rice. You will not regret trying this rice.

review/summary: My preferred rice
review/text: I grew up in Texas and live in Houston.  Texmati is *the* rice.  We have been buying it since the late 80s.  It is very hard to cook wrong, does well sitting out or refrigerated, and is sturdy enough to mix with most any combination of spices.  It is not overly starchy, so is poor for sticky rice uses, but is wonderful otherwise.  Very recommended.<br /><br />Also, I have never gotten a bad batch, or one with stones, sticks, or unidentified dark bits in it (which sometimes happens with bulk rice).  Quality control is excellent.

review/summary: Worth It
review/text: My mom was a great cook, but rice was never something I liked as a kid.  So, as  an adult who loves to cook, I tried several brands/types of rice and had difficulty cooking it, not to mention it was never tasty.  And then I ponied up and spent some money on Texmati.  It's the ONLY rice I will cook, and comes out perfect and yummy every time:  in a microwave rice-cooker, stovetop or (now) a rice cooker.  It is worth the price!  My family has been in the food service industry, and they always ask about the rice... Texmati or any rice Select is the only rice I will buy.

review/summary: Nice tasting rice, just a little $$
review/text: American rice... very nice taste and cooks well in a rice cooker.  Supports the American economy and the price reflects it... but I try to buy American when I can.  Lots of plastic, for not so much rice, but you can reuse/recycle the containers.
