review/summary: Not Just for Adults --- A Toddler's Favorite!
review/text: A few years back, I was looking for a good tasting, high fiber cereal and found this to be absolutely delicious.  Our toddler, who began eating these at 14 months old, will now only eat Cracklin' Oat Bran for breakfast.  She LOVES this cereal!  It makes the perfect snack too.  This provides the fiber she needs, since she's a picky eater (6g, or 24% fiber per serving).  She's now 2 yrs old and all her toddler friends eat Oat Bran too!

review/summary: Great tasting Cerel. Like cookies! But cost too much!
review/text: Crackling Oats Bran is very habit forming so I don't get it often :) It's very delicious and crunchy like cookies. High in fiber too.<br /><br />The cost for me to get this was very high. After S/H I paid over $10 per box - way too high. I won't likely buy it again from this source because of that. However, I did get it in a timely manner and the vendor was very enthusiastic and personable. If only they could lower the cost it I would be a regular.

review/summary: Very Impressed (Edited 2011-05-07)
review/text: Since I started a gluten free diet a few months ago because of Celiacs, I am often tempted by unsafe foods, hamburgers especially. Finding many GF products to be hit or miss, but mostly miss, I gave these buns a chance based off of reviews. When they arrived I immediately opened the box and a bag and was welcomed by a familiar smell. I was impressed by that and took it as a good indicator for it's taste. The buns texture was just right as well. Per the suggestion of other reviewers I toasted the bun and upon eating it found it to be very tasty, matching my fresh memories of wheat buns. After that first bite proved its taste and texture were both spot on, I knew I found a bun I will be eating regularly.<br /><br />The only criticisms I can voice of the Buns is that they are a bit small and need to be sliced. The latter is a non-issue, and being a little small isn't enough of a bother for me to not still love these things. After all, I can eat a tasty burger again.<br /><br />After writing this I find myself wanting to go and make another right now...<br /><br />EDIT: I formerly gave this product a 5-star review, but after purchasing this product several more times over the last year a problem has emerged. One of the packages typically grows mold before I touch it, often only weeks after purchase. I store them in a cool & dry pantry and this problem occurred regularly throughout the year over various batches. This also occurs months before its expiration date. Hopefully this single problem will be fixed, until then I can't give it anything better than 3-stars. Perished food is unacceptable, even if it is a small portion.

review/summary: wow, couldnt believe how much this tasted like a wheat based bun!
review/text: I have tried so many gluten free bread that I had almost given up hope.  I know that we have to deal with this intolerance, but I need some form of bread to allow me to enjoy some of my favorite homemade spreads that just dont taste the same with anything else, like rice cake. [you learn to make your own spreads like hummus, whitefish so that you know what you are putting in it; so worth the effort]<br /><br />So much to my surprise, I lightly toasted the bun (you have to split the bun yourself -no big deal) and had it with almond butter spread: heaven.  The texture was moist and consistent with an 'arnold wholewheat bun' but without the gluten or fructose ingredients!  just loving it.  Finally, at last,being gluten intolerant does not mean no more bread.  I must admit, I did put off trying the bun for about a week as I was dreading that I had chosen a dud: thankfully, I was totally surprised.  Well worth the money.  The only thing is that the bread does need a little toasting (warming up) before eating. As a sandwich for work,it worked just as well as long as I gave it a light toasting before hand.  But that is just me!

I warmed it and toasted it a bit and boy am I Glad I gave it a try. It was the best tasting hamburger I've had in a while . I will be ordering again! Oh yeah I love the added bonus of 8 grams of fiber per bun. No its not the same texture as a bun made with traditional wheat flour but for me and my partner . WE LOVED THEM!

review/summary: Good taste very yeasty and molded way before expiration date
review/text: We were very excited to try out these buns because of the exceptional reviews.  What a joy for my daughter to be able to eat a hamburger  just like everyone else using a "right out of the bag" bun.  She toasted it, and ate the whole thing with a smile.  However, I was just a little concerned about the overwhelming yeast smell opening the package.  Then even more concerned when I read the storage instructions:  Keep in a cool dry place, does not need freezing, refrigerate after opening.  Expires 4 20 11.  So this tells me the buns are loaded with some type of preservative(s).  This can't be good for you.  The daughter stopped liking them so much because she too began complaining about the "yeast" or maybe it was mold taste.  Now out of six packages we have four left.  All the buns in the sealed packages are molded.  We purchased them July 7, 2010 and received a week or so later.  Today is August 25 2010 remember the expiration date is spring 2011!  We have since found out she can't have yeast on top of gluten, casein, and egg yolks.  So we couldn't buy them again anyway.  I just don't think I could recommend them even we could buy them.  Too expensive for them to go to waste like this, and I am very leery of preservatives that would allow these to last so long without freezing or refrigeration.

review/summary: Now I don't have to make my own gluten free hamburger buns
review/text: I have made my own gluten free hamburger buns.  That was really too much like work and the buns were just OK. Now, I can enjoy burgers and other sanwiches without all the fuss!  Ener-G Foods Seattle Hamburger Buns are just what I needed.  Like others have said, they need to be toasted for the best flavor and texture.  I take Toast-it bags to work to prevent cross contamination when using the toasters in our caf&eacute;. Like all gluten free foods, they are a bit pricey, but what are you going to do? I'd rather pay than bake my own... Six packs of four buns seems to be too much for one person.  The rest of my family is not gluten free.  There is a January 2011 expiration date on them (six months from now) but I don't trust it.  So, I froze three packs and refrigerated three for use over the next few weeks(I hope). BTW if you are a Weight Watcher, each bun is 3 points.

review/summary: A travel staple; a bit bland
review/text: I purchased these lemon pepper tuna kits after having purchased many of the spicy thai chili tuna kits.  They provide the same convenience as other flavors in this line (small single-portion tuna can with packet of crackers, spread, and packaged crackers, all in a plastic crush-resistant box). This tuna does not have any corn syrup or artificial flavors or colors but does have modified food starch, which I usually prefer to avoid because it's one of those things that it's not clear what it is or how it was made.  The thing I noticed when eating this tuna was that it didn't have much flavor.  To me, a big point of these kits is that the tuna is seasoned.  I didn't detect much seasoning.  I have since added different things to add more flavor including black pepper, Simply Organic All Purpose Seasoning, garlic, crushed kale chips, and Crispy Red Peppers.  They are convenient and for me, provide variety, but are by no means my favorite.

We highly recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to coffee as a relaxing drink and is also very good if you have a cold or flu!

review/summary: Tastes Really Good
review/text: These are excellent.  Since they have cheese in them which adds a lot of taste, I've found if you don't have milk that they taste quite good just made with straight water instead of the water/milk mix called for on the side of the box.  Also, since the cheese sauce is rich enough, you can cook up some fresh potatoes and add them to stretch the number of servings and not compromise the flavour of the dish much.  Kind of depends if you are looking for something to cook really fast for supper or if you want more servings and are willing to spend a little more time doing it and save some money per serving. You can do both with this product and get good results either way.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed with these, in any case.  Excellent as a stock up item for the pantry.

review/summary: ONE OF OUR OLD STAND-BYS.  We enjoy this coffee and have many uses for the empty containers.
review/text: I like coffee and my wife likes coffee.  Despite the fact that we were warned, starting at a very early age, that coffee would "stunt our growth" and do all kinds of horrible things to our growing little bodies, both of us starting drinking coffee at a very early age.  No, it did not stunt our growth or have any of the other horrid side effects on us in later life.  It did, when I was a wee one, make me rather hyper but I suspect I would have been that way anyway. I have always been in a state hovering between that of giant tree sloth and a crazed ferret...depending on what day of the week it is seemingly.<br /><br />Anyway, as things stand now we still drink quite a lot of coffee with two large pots being consumed daily.  To be quite honest, over the years we have been more inclined to purchase what ever brand was on sale at the time although our two old stand-bys have always been Folgers and Maxwell House.  Of the two, this Folgers French grind (Dark or Medium Dark) probably has the edge over the rest...when we can get it.  Both of us simply like the flavor better.<br /><br />Now that being said and truth be told, the breaking point as to whether or not you like a certain brand of coffee greatly depends upon what you get use to.  I know full well that many swear by the process of buying their own beans, grinding their coffee to suit their taste and proceeding from there.  I do not doubt for a second that this is good coffee...I have had coffee prepared this way many times and it is indeed good.  For us though, the process of going through this, the extra cost of having a quality coffee grinder, the time involved and the extra cost of the truly fresh coffee beans, simply is not worth the trouble...that is just us though and our particular life style.<br /><br />No, we will stick to this stuff and the Maxwell House.  It is what we are use to; it is what we enjoy.  We will switch from on to the other, depending which is on sale at the time.  I must say, the cost of this coffee here on Amazon, if you belong to one of the free shipping programs, is quite attractive and quite competitive.<br /><br />I also like the empty plastic containers and have dozens of uses for them around the house.<br /><br />And no, we did not let our children or grandchildren start drinking coffee at an early age...we feared that it would stunt their growth and do horrid things to their growing bodies.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great product and meets our needs perfectly.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

I know this requires a grinder, and some just do not need this extra step, but I think it is worth it. However, 55 ounces of coffee for $33 is a great buy.

It's a flavorful breakfast and I as a bonus I get over my daily supply of vitamin C. Plus there is no high fructose corn syrup and there's green tea blended into the smoothie mix.

review/text: This is a VERY strong roast and a great morning coffee if you need your eyeballs popped open in a hurry!  I would strongly suggest using the largest cup size when brewing this kcup.  I used quite a bit of sweetener and threw in some cocoa powder which really enhanced the flavor and actually made the coffee much smoother.  Next time, I will use even more milk to further dilute the flavor.  This coffee would be a great base for cappucino, frappucino, etc etc.  I picked this up at Bed/Bath/Beyond for $11.99 with 20% off coupon.  It's also available at Target and Safeway.

review/summary: Just too expensive.
review/text: The Starbuck's French Roast is a good, bold coffee. But, at almost double the price of other comparable brands (Green Mountain Double Black Diamond for one) I just can't justify  the unrealistically high cost.  I'll stick to the Double Black Diamond.  In my opinion it is equally as bold with just a little more flavor.  Since taste is so subjective, you will have to decide for yourself.

review/summary: Starbucks comes to Keurig at last!
review/text: Partisans of Starbucks coffee have been waiting a long time for it to be released in the K-cup delivery system.  Coffee drinkers who like the Starbucks approach to dark roasting will not be disappointed.  The brew is strong but not bitter, slightly smokey but not excessively so, and with a pleasant flavor palette that, to me, seems dominated by chocolate.<br /><br />I've been a coffee fanatic all my life.  Many coffee fanatics take delight in denouncing Starbucks for a variety of reasons, some valid, some mere pretense.  I'm the first to say that Starbucks is not the best coffee in the world and that the Keurig brewing system does not produce the finest cup.  However--and this is a significant however--when one considers the time saved, the hassle avoided, and the waste eliminated, I find this a very satisfactory way to produce a fresh cup when I don't have time to fire up my grinder and brew the in the conventional way.<br /><br />I won't give up my freshly roasted beans, my dripper pot, or my grinder but I will certainly drink--and enjoy--Starbucks K-cups when the time is just not right for a meticulously hand-crafted pot.

review/summary: Nice strong Cup
review/text: This produces a nice strong cup of coffee. I prefer strong coffee..most K-cups usually result in weaker brews. The usual problem with Starbucks is they are pretty expensive. But this deal for around 50c a cup is a very good deal, usually starbucks brand k-cups sell for about 1$ a cup.<br /><br />Update: on the ones sold by warehouse deals: the best before on those is aug 2012, so all those hoarders start drinking!

review/summary: Great K-Cup Coffee
review/text: First off, for those of you crying about the price of this coffee......... you probably shouldn't have this coffee maker in the first place. This is the best k-cup I have tried yet. You can use the "larger cup" button on these k-cups and get a great tasting, aromatic, strong cup of coffee. I can even see a little bit of foam around the rim of my cup when the brewing is complete. If you do not like strong coffee (as the French Roast always is) then don't buy this coffee. I will be trying the Pikes Place k-cup next.<br /><br />P.S.  As for the Dunkin' Donuts K-cups, do not waste your time. They are the same price as Starbucks, and you can only get them at the stores. I had my wife send me some of the original blend and it tastes nothing like their coffee.

review/text: I have tried all the Coffee People flavors (Jet Fuel, Tiger, Wake up Call,) as well as most of the Green Mountain flavors. I have found that the Sumatra by SB is the best tasting one of them all. It makes me happy to get out of bed and have my Sumatra coffee. When you brew this coffee, it has a "head" on it when it comes out of the Keurig spout, it is just like the smell at the SB store, and also has that very fresh taste. I have found that most of the KCups are either crazy weak, or just too acidic for my taste...I swear, thank goodness SB finally got in the KCup game. No, I do not work for SB.

review/text: This Starbucks French Roast K-Cup is indeed a very delicious and bold coffee that tastes every bit as good as the in-store brew. We typically drink the much more affordable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Donut Shop K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, but occasionally like to try other types. There is no doubt that this Starbucks coffee is better tasting but it is a too expensive when drinking 4-5 cups a day.<br /><br />Recommended for the flavor (5 stars) but not at the retail price (3 stars).<br /><br />CFH

review/text: Simply the best K-cup I've sampled so far (and I've sampled many).  If you like bold, rich coffee than you should definitely try this one. When it comes right down to it, it's still cheaper than buying a cup of coffee outside of the home (even at a donut store) so I don't see the price as that exorbitant. Sometimes quality comes at a price.

review/summary: Just so gross....
review/text: This coffee tastes like chocolate that's gone bad.  It's overpriced and just not very good.  Starbucks has always over-roasted their beans.  I guess if you like that then you might like this coffee.  To my tastebuds however, it was just bitter and gross with a weird off-taste that left me making faces long after the cup was gone.<br /><br />Also, to all the reviewers who are saying that this was finally a strong k-cup, I say bah.  There are many other brands that make a cup just as strong but much better tasting.  This was just swill.  Bitter gross swill.<br /><br />If Coffee People still made their french roast I wouldn't have even bothered putting this in the brewer.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA70">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 36-Count</a> is my current favorite for my Keurig.  It's so much cheaper than a Starbucks k-cup.  But even if it weren't, it's still a better cup of coffee.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.  Overpriced and over-roasted equals bad coffee.

review/summary: Italian? Hmmm, not so much..
review/text: I was very disappointed in this coffee, as I really wanted a good organic Italian coffee to replace my favorite yet non-organic staple. Although it may be a little darker in color than traditional medium roasted coffee, the flavor was very "green" tasting. It lacks the robust flavor of a true Italian roast, compared to an unknown brand I had at the home of a very traditional NY Italian family, and the non-organic Italian roasted beans which I normally get at a well-known coffee chain. I ordered ground by mistake, then whole bean, but plan to give away all of what I have left, as the taste simply falls flat.

I placed an order from another seller at the same time who had run out of the product, bought replacement product and had it shipped before this seller even sent the order confirmation. If you are placing an order 6 months ahead of time then I would recommend this seller.

review/text: The deer in my area (private land in the south western part of virginia) really like this product. I poured it out once in front of a trail camera and the deer activity remained fairly constant at the location for 2 weeks. They scraped the first 2-3 inches of soil off trying to get to it. I poured it out again when the acorns started falling and there was probably 50% less activity at the site but, they were still visiting the site. Because these are not farm country deer and reside mostly deep in the mountains, I will continue to use the product to provide the deer with minerals they would otherwise have a difficult time locating naturally and because they apparantly like the taste/smell because they usually find it the same day I put it out. Not to mention, it's much easier to carry up the mountain than a 50lb sack of corn.

review/text: These bars should be listed as candy rather than a snack bar. The fact that they have a tiny bit of oats in them didn't make up for all the gooey caramel and the overly sweet taste of the sugar substitute. If you want a snack bar that's low in sugar, I recommend Glucerna's chocalate crisp bars or one of their other flavors.
