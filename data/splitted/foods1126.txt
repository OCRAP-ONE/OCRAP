review/summary: Expresso...beats heck out of 5hour energy in the afternoon!
review/text: Originally purchased the product for convenience, my machine takes loose or pod, but loose takes forever to satisfy our little circle at work with cleanup between each cup.The pods I found (same brand we pay $5 cup across the street at the Italian restaurant uses)for about 30 cents, its not only convenient, its excellent, each cup is individually wrapped so its grinder fresh, easy cleanup, and a great price (especially with free shipping over $25 from Amazon!)If your an espresso or capachino aficionado I can't recommend this enough.

review/summary: OK, but not robust enough for me
review/text: I wanted so much to like this coffee.  The price was great, especially after signing up for the subscription and the special Lavazza discount that Amazon had for the month of October.  Have a Cusinart EM100, which works well with espresso pods.  But I like strong coffee, and the Lavazza is just too mild for my taste. Think I will stick with the Intenso Gusto Forte, a robust espresso pod which I originally got from Amazon.

review/summary: 50/50 choice
review/text: First of all it is loosely packed. When I first used the product, water came out first before I could see any coffee and that is entirely on the packing. To me the chocolate like taste is not for me. It tempers with the way I like my coffee to taste. Bottom-line it is not  nearly as good as Starbucks. Had I rated this product the first week I tried it, I would have given it one star.  But now since it has been a while I am a little more forgiving. It is cheaper than most pods to begin with. Pressing on the pod helps the loose packing problem. Since I drink at least 3 cups a day, I have chosen to make one Starbucks and then do the rest with this to save some. But if you ask me to entirely switch to this product, I wouldn't even think about it. However I would suggest the before you get 150 pack, first try the lesser package. At first I felt trapped with 150 pods that I hated until I compromised and coped. If you're not looking to save, look away. But if you want to save, after a while it is not too bad.

review/summary: Great Lavazza Coffee
review/text: Lavazza is one of the better espresso coffees from Italy. It's consistently high quality, with a smooth taste, and a nice crema. I've purchased other coffee from this seller, and the shipping is quick and very secure. You can't beat the price at around 30 cents per pod. I highly recommend this coffee and the seller on Ebay who offers it for such a reasonable price.

review/summary: Okay espresso, super convenient
review/text: When I first bought my new espresso machine, I thought I'd get ESE pods to make the espresso-making a bit easier and less messy.<br /><br />That's exactly what I got: the pods are easy to use, and make a decent shot of espresso.<br /><br />Then I started using Lavazza and Illy pre-ground coffees, and grinding my own. The resultant espresso is a solid amount better because you can much more finely adjust the dose and tamp - how much coffee goes into the portafilter, and  how hard you smush the coffee into the portafilter. Pre-ground or whole bean espresso is also a fair bit cheaper than the pods.<br /><br />So, if you want a *decent* shot of espresso, with no mess or fuss, go with the pods. If you are willing to put in a bit of effort, though, you can get better espresso at a lower price.<br /><br />As far as the pods go, the Gran Crema are the best I've tried.

review/summary: WORKS WELL IN DELONGHi EC155
review/text: Bought these Lavazza Gran Crema Espresso Pods after purchasing a Delonghi EC155 Espresso Machine. This was my first dabble in homemade Espresso and I figured the pods would be easier to start with. I mainly drink Lattes/Cappuccinos so I don't know how the pure Espresso is supposed to taste, but it has a good crema. After I put the pod in the holder I give it a little tamp with the tamper that came with the machine and it works great every time. I purchased the 150-count box and actually received 172 in the box...Bonus!

review/text: I use the Lavazza Espresso Gran Crema in a Delonghi espresso machine and it tastes wonderful.  The Crema is great and rich.  These did not work in my older Gaggia machine.  My Delonghi has a special O ring on the inside of the holder that prevents the water from going to the side and by passing the pod.  Basically any pod would do great in this machine.  I recommend using only filtered water in all machines. The setiment in water can cause alot of headaches even with regular cleaning.  I just signed up for a subscribtion of and save 15%, a great deal for 150 pods.  The taste compares well with our local coffee shops.<br /><br />Kim

review/summary: Good coffee
review/text: I own an espresso machine and love coffee. However the machine is a pain to use when I'm in a rush to work in the morning, which is most mornings.  I was thinking about getting a Keurig pod machine to make my mornings easier, however I didn't want to have yet another appliance sitting on my counter.  Then I remembered that my espresso maker came with an ESE (easy serve espresso) pod adapter so I decided to give these pods a try based on the good reviews.<br /><br />Although clean up is a lot easier, the coffee pods are a bit weak in flavor.  I make Americanos in the morning, and one pod in 8oz of water is not quite strong enough for me.  Two pods is perfect.  I will no doubt need to use 4 pods for my travel mug to get the bold flavor that I desire.  Overall, the coffee is good and cleanup is easy.

There is a mark on the back of each individual package in the lower left corner.<br />That said, the coffee produced is slightly more watery than the Illy pods we are used to drinking. Even though the Lavazza is slightly watery (and you can fix that by running the shot for less time) the taste is actually pretty decent. And for a fast fix, with this price per pod, you can't go wrong.<br />Remember: Fresh roasted at home is best!

These pods even brew for about as long other ESE pods using my Saeco Espresso Classico machine. I don't know whether it's the grind that Lavazza uses, but the Lavazza pods don't seem to be as tightly packed as other ESE pods, and the resulting espresso is slightly less strong than the espresso made by the other ESE pods. That being said, the espresso is perfectly acceptable, particularly when you take into account the price that you pay when you go on Amazon's subscription plan.

review/text: I've received several orders of the 150 pod packs this year with the subscription service. The taste is usually pretty good. Not as great as the Espressione 100% Arabica (which is my favorite) but this is cheaper and does the morning caffeine trick. The last package received last week is just awful. They are not expired and yet smell and taste like wet dirty shoes or what I would imagine wet dirty shoes taste like - since I have no real experience with that :). Anyway I called Amazon today to complain and see if I could get my money back. I wasn't expecting much since there is a no return policy on grocery items.<br /><br />AMAZON WAS SO HELPFUL! I was only on hold for a few minutes. I spoke with a great woman who is shipping a replacement package to me overnight. I don't even have to mess with shipping back the bad pods. I can just dispose of them. I'm totally happy with the great customer service.<br /><br />I hope the next shipment tastes as expected.

review/summary: Absolutely horrible quality
review/text: I recently switched to the Lavazza pods after trying the Starbucks pods for a month. The difference is like night and day: the Lavazza pods are disgusting! Compared to the espresso I can get from a Starbucks pod, and also compared to the espresso I can get in any coffee shop in town, the shots produced by the Lavazza pods are watery and tasteless. They're not simply 'marginally' worse than the Starbucks pods. The espresso produced by the Lavazza pods has a hideously bland taste, to the extent that it pains both me and my wife to drink them (which is surprising, because neither she nor I have particularly demanding taste buds).<br /><br />The first problem with the Lavazza pods is that they include a LOT of excess filter material around the pod, which prevents the espresso machine from making a good, water-tight seal and results in water dripping out of the brewing chamber.  We experimented at great length with trimming away the excess material on these pods to try to get a better espresso.  With some finesse (by trimming excess filter and carefully positioning the ESE pod in just-the-right spot), it is possible to get a good seal.  Once my wife and I accomplished this, the quality of our Lavazza espressos improved dramatically...but was still light-years behind what we expected.  No matter how hard we've tried, we can't get a good shot of espresso from these pods (and we've tried manually tamping them, trimming excess filter material, making sacrifices to various caffeine-related deities, and even performing special brewing dances to appease the coffee gods).<br /><br />Our advice:  AVOID LAVAZZA ESE PODS AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!  You can find incredibly better alternatives at a 10-20% higher price point!

review/text: I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this. These pods do not work correctly in my ESE pod machine (DeLonghi). The Baronet brand pods work perfectly. Didn't realize that not all ESE pods are made to the same standards. The Lavazza pods are not big enough or something because at best you get a dish-water weak coffee. Since I have about 130 of these pods left, I've started pulling the pods apart and using it a loose coffee, a complete waste of money and pod material.

review/summary: Makes colored water in my new Ariete Espresso Machine
review/text: Regretfully, these pods don't work in my brand new Ariete Cafe Prestige espresso machine.  All I get is colored water.  Yuk!!<br /><br />I know the pods are the problem because the machine makes wonderful espresso using the coffee beans I roast at home.  I had hoped to use the Lavazza pods to avoid the mess of using loose coffee grounds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I made the mistake of buying 150 of them from Amazon and now I can't return them.  I tried using them to make American coffee but the results were just as bad.  I also tried cutting the pods open and using the ground coffee inside to make espresso.  That didn't work either.<br /><br />What a dissappointment.

review/summary: Cats like it but it's not really a "diet" food
review/text: I decided to try this food for my two slightly overweight cats. They have generally resisted dry food changes before, so I was pleasantly surprised when they took to the Healthy Weight formula right away and were willing to eat it by itself within a week. Personally I didn't find the pellets' strange gray-ish color to be very appetizing, but I wasn't the one eating them so I guess it doesn't matter!<br /><br />Something to note here is that while this food may be low-calorie compared to other Wellness formulas, at 450 kcal/cup the caloric content of this food is the same or higher than many similar brands' normal formulas, such as:<br />-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X2A60">Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul Dry Cat Food for Adult Cat, Chicken Flavor, 18 Pound Bag</a> -- 367 kcal/cup<br />-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAFJ16">AvoDerm Natural Indoor Hairball Care Chicken & Herring Meal Adult Dry Cat Food</a> -- 388 kcal/cup<br />-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00494LRTQ">Nutro Natural Choice Active Health Indoor Formula Adult Dry Cat Food</a> -- 384 kcal/cup<br />-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O81FZY">Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Cats, 5.5-Pound Bag</a> -- 379 kcal/cup<br /><br />I'm not pointing this out to necessarily dissuade people from buying Wellness Healthy Weight - it's still a high-quality product and I was pleased by how well my cats liked it. That said, I know that many people choose "healthy weight" formula foods specifically because they want to slim down their cats without having to reduce portions. With this particular product, you may actually have to feed your cat a smaller amount than you did of their old food if you want them to lose weight or even to maintain their current weight. Just something to be aware of!

review/summary: Excellent product for indoor cats
review/text: My Cat loves this food, and I love it too because since she has been eating it, she has lost a bit of weight, has plenty of energy, and her COAT looks amazing! It is much thicker and shinier than before and she seems very happy. I don't think it is too expensive - one bag lasts our cat almost 3 months! That means you are spending less than $15 per month on food, and honestly what good Cat-Parent wouldn't spend only $0.50 per day to make sure his/her little one is getting excellent nutrition?

review/summary: Pricey but both cats lost weight
review/text: I have two overweight cats that I had been feeding EVO and Newman's Own. What I didn't realize is how many calories these brands have, especially EVO which is packed with dense protein. I tried scaling back on portions and got mewed at constantly until I caved in. I decided to try this brand since it's not filled with fillers and claimed it could help lose weight.<br /><br />At first they picked at it but within a month they ate the entire meal without complaint. They have been losing weight (now around 2 lbs each) over the past 4 months.<br /><br />Like with humans, there's no magic bullet with weight loss. We all need more excercise and better portion control. This helps me prevent overfeeding since there are less calories but more bulk. I also introduced new play toys to get them active again. The drawback is that this brand is expensive and it smells oddly of dried fruit.<br /><br />I say if you don't mind the price, give the small bag a try.

review/text: My cat isn't overly picky and deals with food changes pretty easily, but after three days with this stuff, he's barely eaten 1/3 of a cup! Plus, what he has eaten didn't stay down for long. I'm not happy, but luckily I can take it back for a refund of switch it. $22 for 5lbs of cat food that my cat won't eat... thank goodness I can exchange it! I'm just so disappointed. I wanted something healthy and grain free for my chubby kitty, but it looks like I'm be going back to my old brand...

review/text: ...I had gotten the food since one of my cats is getting really big. I figured it was a good idea to put them on this food since they really like the Wellness CORE. However, my big cat seems to have gotten bigger. It's hard for me to keep her from eating out of both cats bowls, so I'm at a bit of a loss. I may have to look into a different diet food, but my concern is that she will just eat the other cat's food (the one who doesn't need to be on a diet). Otherwise, they love the Wellness foods!

review/text: This is truly amazing salt... if you're a salt-a-holic like me, you'll appreciate it's amazing saltiness, but also it's delicate infusion of flavor-enhancing, depth-increasing grace... I've never imagined a "graceful" salt, but this is it!  The smoked flavored salt is delightful... although it's very subtle, and I like a more intense flavor of smoke, so I'd take a Salish over this this, but it's a great combo for salt tasters... Worth the price - cheeper than your corner gourmet store, if they had it, which they won't, so don't feel bad about not supporting your local businesses because they most likely won't carry this!

review/text: I bought this piece after seeing a similar item in Chinatown while I was in San Francisco. I immediately fell in love with the idea. I am a fan of Chinese/Japanese art and this item was right up my alley. When the piece arrives, it will require a little bit of maintenance.. This mostly comes in the form of reshaping the little pink flowers. They become a bit smashed during packaging. This only takes 10 or so minutes and after that the item looks great!<br /><br />Oh, and it's easier to maintain than a traditional Bonsai tree ;)

review/text: Well, it's kind of hard to review dog food. My dog doesn't seem to like this flavor much. He seems to prefer the lamb and rice version much better. This is a very high quality product, it seems, compared to other dog foods. It is not watery and doesn't stink to high heaven. We're vegetarians, so low quality meat makes me nauseated, but this product is okay in that regard. It's just not my dog's favorite. We only buy the lamb Pet Guard now.

review/text: OK, so I never thought I'd be ordering groceries on Amazon, but this is the thing that got me.  When my local Asian grocery stopped carrying these noodles, I knew I had to find somewhere that did.  My family loves these made with a bit of coconut milk with the water, chipped up scallions, and a bit of meat if there's some around (try chicken thigh for really good flavor).  I went searching for them on Amazon almost for whimsy, but when I found them, they were *cheaper* than the local store used to have them, and with my Amazon Prime the shipping was free.  We'll go through 60 pretty fast.<br /><br />Nom nom! :)

review/summary: Great for potty training!!
review/text: I adopted a 1 year old Yorkie rescue pup who is only semi potty trained. I was having some troubles getting him to potty outside today (like most days). Then these awesome treats arrived! I ordered the Zukes mini naturals roasted chicken treats last night and they were already here this morning with Prime. I gave him one to taste test and he gobbled it up and instantly wanted another. I then grabbed two of them, went outside with him knowing I had the treats in hand and I asked him to go potty. He went instantly! I think tasty treats really do make a big difference. These are also nice and small so giving them a few isn't going to pile on the pounds. We are feeding our pups a grain free dog food so it only makes sense to get grain free treats too. I will be back for more of these for sure both of my pups LOVE these!!!

review/text: Our dog loves these.  We started her on it when she was 7 weeks old (and had about 4 teeth), and she loved it.  She was still too young to eat milk bones or even beggin' strips, but she could eat these.  I also don't feel bad about giving these to her because they are only 3.5 calories each. There is a rapid change in behavior when she hears me open up the treat bag... she sits, stops chewing, and starts randomly performing tricks, hoping to get one... it's pretty funny. We have repurchased these and will continue to do so.

review/summary: Good size for training
review/text: My dog loves these and they're my training treats of choice.  I've only tried the chicken flavor.<br /><br />They're semi-moist, not messy, and pretty small.  They're not scored, but can still be halved or quartered with a sharp knife or a long fingernail.  Each piece has 3 calories.  For med-small dogs, you can cut them down into really tiny bits and still make a dog happy.  If you quarter them, you could give 20 rewards during training and only be adding 15 calories.<br /><br />The bag has a reclosable seal, and you'll need it because they dry out and get hard and crumbly if left exposed.  If I take some with me away from the house, I put precut treats in a snack-sized zip bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />They also come in a larger sized bag which is more economical.

review/text: We have tried a lot of different treats (Milo's kitchen meatballs, Train-Me treats, etc), all of which were great, but I have settled on Zuke's because they are already the right size for a small dog and seem to be made with not too many fillers.  I have a 2 1/2 year old rescue who had a lot of 'tude for 11 lbs.  We adopted her a year ago supposedly already house- and crate trained, but she was absolutely neither. Apart from great advice on aspca.org, it takes a TON of treats to start training an adult dog from scratch.  Of course we used plenty of things around the house (cut up string cheese, hard boiled eggs, stuffed frozen peanut butter in Kongs), but sometimes you don't have anything prepared and you have to crate the dog and get to work. She loves these treats and has proved a quick study.  Happy treating!

review/text: My dogs love these treats - especially the Chicken flavor. They are small, but I find them to be perfect for training.  They are small, low in calories and of high quality so I don't feel bad about giving quite a few out when the dogs are working on learning new things or reinforcing good behavior.  The price on Amazon is much better than my local vendor and delivery is always fast.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Perfect Training Treat
review/text: A trainer suggested these treats over a year ago and once I bought them I never when back to hotdogs.  They are really easy to use and my dogs love them.  When I trained our smaller dog, they were easy to break apart.  Ever since I used them the first time I became a loyal Zuke's convert!

review/summary: Perfect for training
review/text: My husband and I are vegetarians and we were looking for a treat we could use for our puppy's training sessions that wouldn't gross us out. We typically make our own peanut butter dog treats for our dogs, but they're too big and too crunchy to work for training. These moist mini peanut butter flavor treats are perfect! They don't gross us out and both our dogs (the puppy and our 2 year old dog) LOVE them and are highly motivated during training sessions.

review/summary: I think they're bland, but my puppy loves them
review/text: The aroma of these treats is fantastic--there's a tantalizing meaty, smokey smell that wafts from the bag. And the texture of the treats are pleasingly soft and moist. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed when I tried them. I think they are rather bland, and because they are coarsely ground there are hard bits of stuff in them, one of which got caught between my teeth. I think they could have used a little bit more salt. Also, they're a little small so it takes a lot to fill me up.<br /><br />On the other hand, my puppy loves these things and they have been great motivators for teaching her tricks, so I guess they have that going for them.

review/text: These are definitely "MINI".  I guess I wasn't really paying attention when I ordered them, bc it looks like hamster food.  My dog still loves it.  I usually grab a small handful and throw them in her bowl.  She never complains.  that being said, here is my review from another order from this dog treat line.  It still applies to this product!<br />I try to stick to all natural products in my household.  That goes double for my dog.  she is a super mutt with a strong stomach, but that doesn't mean I want to take any chances.  these seem like quality treats and she really enjoys them. I have purchased several flavors and she loves them all.  will definitely buy them again.

review/text: These are sooo great for training. I just stick a few in my back pocket, usually even break them into halves or thirds and use as treats. My dog loves them, and while she isn't the pickiest, she certainly doesn't like some treats. The real reason they are great though is because she likes them enough so that she will do her tricks for only a third of the treat! (This is an extremely tiny portion, which shows how flavorful they are.) And if they estimate correctly that's only one calorie of her diet! Can't go wrong, I've had chicken and salmon and both are great.

review/text: These treats are a great choice. There all natural. My pom mix has a very sensitive tummy and this treat does not bother him. As soon as I grab the bag my dogs try to do there tricks as fast as they can to get one of these. There soft in texture and the size is great for my 3 month old chi mix who is only 4 lbs. The only reason I gave this treat 4 stars is because they smell horrible other than that if you can deal with the smell. I recommend these! especially to anyone how has a small dog or a dog with a sensitive tummy!

review/summary: Perfect size, but goes quickly
review/text: Like everyone else, I bought these because they are all natural with no byproducts and they're the perfect size for training. I have a Pomeranian puppy and since he was 7 weeks old, I've had him on Blue Buffalo Wilderness Puppy formula which has worked wonders for him and he cannot get enough of. He's now 7 months old and he's as perfect as can be. Prior to trying Zuke's, I used to feed him Pup-Peroni since he loved them, considering that he has a sensitive stomach, it worked for him. After my last batch was almost done, I figured I would buy a couple packs of Zuke's.<br /><br />Of course, his stomach has to get used to the product but his bowels has been watery and not as dense and hard as when he was on Pup-Peroni. He's been on Zuke's for a week and a half and he's still getting used to it. Also, the product goes really quickly as I only have a couple ounces left. So I'd say that 16oz lasts two weeks whereas 16oz of the Pup-Peroni lasted a lot longer.<br /><br />I'm thinking about switching over to the Pup-Peroni if his stools remains watery and soft as it's been 1.5 weeks since he's been getting Zuke's. I still have another pound of the Peanut Butter, so we'll see. All-in-all, my little man loves this stuff even if his stomach isn't digesting it normally.

review/summary: Great Training Treats
review/text: These treats are perfect for training.  They do not crumble and a dog can eat them quickly and easily.  A dog will not lose focus since he won't have to stop and eat.  I actually cut them in quarters for agility class.<br /><br />As far as flavors, my dogs will eat anything.  From the owner's perspective, the salmon smell so much better than the chicken.  The chicken has a typical dog food meat smell, but the salmon does not smell like dog food at all.

review/text: I have been buying these treats both on amazon and at my local pet stores for almost 2 years now.  They are the perfect size for a training treat, they fit nicely into some treat dispensing toys (like the artichoke one that Planet Dog makes), and my dog loves the taste! They are moist, but they have a tendency to get dried out if you don't reseal the bag after opening. They are made in the U.S. and don't have any wheat or corn products in them.  They're also only 3 calories each, and perfect for training since they don't completely fill my dog up!

I have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKTG">Ourpets DT-10504 Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball , 5 Inches , Colors may vary</a>and these treats are the perfect size for it. They roll out easily but not TOO easily so it keeps him busy for at least an hour. I got the chicken flavor and my dog thinks they're great. I love them because they are healthier for him than the other treats we'd been giving him and they are great to train with. I'm glad it comes in the 16 ounce bag because we go through them pretty quick!

review/summary: Good til the last treat
review/text: Usually I don't write reviews, but who really does unless the product is either outstanding or absolutely horrible. Thankfully this review is not the latter. When I initially got my puppy she was not house-trained, didn't know any tricks and was not food motivated. However, with these treats she was potty-trained and knows quite a few tricks. It was effort on my part, but those treats were definitely a good motivator. Also, looking around at other treats and their prices these are a really great value. If you want something that your dog will enjoy and a great value for the amount and type of treat this is what you want to look for. You and your dog won't be disappointed. I know mine isn't.

review/summary: Great For Service Dogs!
review/text: My greyhound service dog loves these treats! I use them for training or reinforcing good behavior while out. They aren't too stinky, aren't too big, and are really healthy. An additional plus for service dogs is that these treats are soft, so there's no loud crunching sound when you use them in the library or in that quiet waiting room at the doctor's office. The small, round design means you'll fit a lot of these into a typical training pouch, so you won't run out. One note I would add is that, if you don't use them all on a particular outing, be sure to dump the unused treats back in the resealable bag or they may get hard. Other than that, these really are the perfect training/reinforcement treat for service dogs! Great stuff!

review/summary: Did they change the recipe for these??? Rosemary and cherries?
review/text: I have ordered these just a few times for our new puppy and recieved exactly the picture shown (the chicken flavor) but I just re-ordered a new bag and thought I was getting exactly what I had ordered previously but this one is slightly differt.  They have added 'anti-oxidents' to the recipe so it has cherry, rosmary and some other things added.  They are still the small round training treats and are still great (a little more calories at 3.5 per treat instead of 2) but I found it interesting that it wasn't as advertised by amazon.  Do they still sell the old ones or has Zuke's just changed their items?  FYI, I chose the '1 pound' option in the drop-down when I ordered.<br />I still give this 5 stars because I think they are the best treats out there for training, they are small, moist, stinky (that's good for dogs) and made with healthy quality ingredients.  Just not sure if Zuke's changed them or if I was sent something slightly different by accient.  I guess I will find out next time I try to order them!

review/summary: Nuts for these!!!
review/text: We adopted a 10 month mix breed and needed to tap into his hunting breed's tendencies and these treats are the only reason our guy gets excited about training and hunting for treats.<br /><br />We ordered a Kong Wobbler too and these treats are the perfect size and shape to put inside and keep him entertained for awhile.  They're great for having on hand just as treats or as rewards while working on training.  You can carry alot and it not be awkward.<br /><br />He loves the chicken flavor and can't seem to get enough.  I love the price for the size of the bag you get and they last a good while as long as you ration.  Even though they are definitely "mini", each one has such a strong (not overwhelming) aroma and taste that just that little morsel is enough for our big guy.  His nose knows.<br /><br />I'm ordering more today and will continue to order as long as they're available.  Just wish they were on auto delivery.  We'd never want to run out.  Any other treat just won't do.  I highly recommend you at least try them.  You and your pooch will be glad you did.

I found these mini treats, and the bag had awesome reviews from a good amount of people. The treats weren't pricey at all, and I went ahead and bought them. My dog absolutely loves these. They're moist, small, and perfect for training. She listens so well when I bring these out, and she hasn't gotten tired of them at all. She's perfected two new tricks on top of repeating her old ones in just a matter of one day! The only negative I would say is that they do have a particular smell since they are very moist and natural. Overall, these treats are a huge success!

review/summary: Zuke's Salmon, Chicken, and Rabbit work well for my picky dog!
review/text: I've been using Zuke's Mini's for training since I first brought my girl home and she (surprisingly, for she's quite picky) still tolerates them and *sometimes* even seems to want to work for them. (Not having a food motivated dog SUCKS for training - I could literally be walking around with big macs in my pockets and it just wouldn't matter) They are low calorie and reasonably cheap (I can actually find them at some local stores cheaper than I can on Amazon, sometimes) as the bags tend to last a while. (I actually use kibble mixed with the treats when working with her, becuase I'm sneaky like that and she doesn't notice the difference once we get going)<br /><br />Of course not all dogs work with all treats - and it SHOULD be noted that although these treats do not have a lot of the "bad" ingredients in them they still do have grains. (NO grain treats have a much different texture, either from being pure meat or using various ingredients as the "binder" necessary for treats like this)<br /><br />This is the only type of treat we feed that has grains in it; almost everything else she eats is pure meat in various fashions. (lamb lung, water buffalo, venison, rabbit, etc)<br /><br />If you have a dog with allergies you may want to try some of the grain-free options for training treats, like the mini lamb lungs or mini beef jerkies, etc. For our needs, though, these are perfect. \<br /><br />I was SO psyched when I saw that they came out with the "rabbit" variety! I try to keep the variety going in her diet and she doesn't like the peanut butter kind so it was always down to alternating between chicken or salmon, both of which are very common proteins. I can't tell if she likes this kind more or not, but she's definitely eating them which is a good sign! They tend to be more expensive than the other variety so I don't buy them as often, but love including it in the mix!<br /><br />One last thing I wanted to mention, my Mom has small dogs (tiny chihuahuas) and they can eat this size training treat with ease. However, I recently purchased the SMALL training treats for her (they are usually about 1/2 cal per treat) and she said that they are PERFECT for her sized dogs that she is constantly trying to diet. I don't believe they are made in that size by Zuke's but there are several brands out there that also use similar ingredients (no bad preservatives, no corn, by products, etc) that may work better for very small dogs.

review/text: My dog LOVES these treats. They tend to have a very strong fish oil smell. So if you are afraid of the fishy smell, don't get it. But I think my dog likes it because of the smell. These treats are really small in size. They are great for training. You can give your dog several of these without worrying about him over eating. Amazon's price was much more reasonable than any other retailer. You can buy a 1 pound bag on Amazon for almost the same price as a 6 ounce bag at other retailers. It's definitely worth it to buy a big bag if your dog eats them a lot.

review/summary: Smells Aweful, but Jimmy Loves It
review/text: I can't stand the smell of this treat.  They are very bite-sized (tiny little beads).  I wouldn't mind them so much if they smelled a little better.  As it stands I can't be near the opened bag without getting naseous.  My daughter feeds him treats now.

review/summary: Yummy doggy dots
review/text: I didn't realize when i bought these that they were going to be so small, so as a treat for anything larger than a yorkie you might have to use a small handful of these. Great for my dog outside of the size because they are grain free and have no fillers which my dog is allergic to. They must taste good because the dog cant wait to get a treat after he walk outside.

review/summary: Great yummy treat for my little ones
review/text: I got a border collie puppy recently and have been working on training her. She's so smart so it's nice but she's tiny so most treats are kind of big for her. I didn't want her training treats to take her a bit to chew on. So these are great and trust me she goes BONKERS over them. I wash my hands after the training sessions because she goes crazy over the lingering smell too. I also have 2 cats and they both show up when the bag opens. They have PLENTY of their own treats but they love these yummy morsels. I'll be buying them the Zukes cat treats so they can enjoy them just as much

review/summary: Zukes Mini Naturals - Healthy Treats
review/text: Our toy poodle loves these treats!  We use them for training and for maintaining bathroom breaks outside.  We use these smaller treated for "pee" rewards and larger ones of another brand for "poo" rewards.  At first I thought this would be excessive, but when we tried to stop and she had a set back of accidents in the house we felt the rewards were a far better price to pay than messes in the house and punishing our dog.  So this way everyone is happy.  Since we give rewards several times daily we felt having all natural treats was a far better choice.  We have trained our dog to lay down while we are eating so no more begging; to roll over; sit; and stay using these treats.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces
review/text: My dog loves Zukes Mini Natural Treats! treats.  He expects them before he goes to sleep for the evening, and often looks for them when we just tell him he is as good boy.  When we run out of them he actually pouts because now he expects them every day.  What I like about these treats for our dog is that they are natural, no chemicals, and just the right size for our dog to chew (he is 28 lbs.).  Also, some of the proceeds go toward Cancer Research for animals, which I am all for since we lost a Jack Russell to cancer at the age of 5 (Lymphoma).  Very sad to see an animal suffer with Cancer, as with a human, and also to lose them, which is especially emotionally stressful.  We will purchase Zukes as long as our dog loves them - and we know this will be for his life.
