review/summary: Awarded Best Taste 2004 by American Culinary Institute
review/text: This product is the best lemon juice I have ever tasted, what gets me it taste better, than fresh lemon juice, I think why  that is,they add to the lemon juice  the oil of the lemon from the skin of the lemon. This product comes from Italy, but should be able to find in the produce section, if not Amazon has it, which is great, it would be nice if they sold it in case lots.<br /><br />If you want GREAT Lemonade, buy the small unsweeten packet of Kool-aid Lemonade, about 29 cents,however Amazon has it about 20 cents a packet in bulk, believe it or not the contents has small lemon pieces in it.  I add a extra 1/4 cup of sugar to the recipe, and one or two squirts of sicilia Lemon juice for a little added tartness.  I just can't drink enough of this lemonade, and all my friends now make their own, as it only cost them about 39 cents for a 2 liter bottle, instead of the store boughten stuff, which is anywhere fron 1.39 to 1.89. I think you will find this is the best lemonade you ever drank.  If you like pink lemonade, just add a squirt of strawberry syrup.  ENJOY

review/summary: The best bottled lemon juice
review/text: I have tried other lemon juice brands and Sicilia is the ONLY bottled lemon juice I have ever found that actually tastes like real lemons, and that includes Real Lemon lemon juice, which in my opinion does NOT taste like lemons. I can use this on fish as if it were an actual lemon and not tell the difference.

They say refrigerate after opening, but I keep all but the current bottle in the freezer.  I see they also have an organic lemon juice, I'll try it as soon as I can get it.

review/text: I was happy to see this product available for subscription. The price is very good compare to buying from Asian food grocery. Growing up in Japan, I tried MANY these instant curry sauce and these products are very popular in Japan. Compare to other products, these are okay, better than nothing. I don't know what makes me feel bad after eating this, but my guess is the fat in this product. Good thing is it's very convenient to make a quick meal with steamed rice by boiling the pouch in hot water for few minutes. There are better ones out there (try S&B Golden Curry, for example), but they are more expensive.

review/summary: My least favorite SodaStream flavor
review/text: My wife and I have had a SodaStream for about a year now. It hasn't changed our lives, but we like it.<br /><br />Some flavors are excellent, most are passable (think generic soda), and a few aren't so good.<br /><br />But this Cherry Cola flavor, oh my goodness, it is AWFUL.<br /><br />If I had to describe it, it's kind of a mediciney black licorice. Just terrible. They need to abandon this flavor, because if this were the first flavor I'd sampled, I'd immediately walk away from the SodaStream display.

review/text: While I do love the SodaStream system, I've found that some of the flavors are a bit overpowering if using SodaStreams reccomended amount of syrups.  I for one, find that most of the flavors are way too sweet for my taste so I use a LOT less syrup.<br /><br />Really, soda flavor IS a personal preference and you do need to make the soda YOUR way.  I remember growing up in the 50's and LOVING the cola that came in the small 6 1/4 ounce bottles while never really enjoying its competitor... the other cola that came in 12 oz bottles.  No brand names needed here although I'm sure most folks over the age of 40 know just what I'm talking about.<br /><br />So, go for the SodaStream system and feel free to 'have it your way'!

review/summary: Awful and disgusting
review/text: I recently purchased a SodaStream machine which included a 12 pack assortment of flavors. This was not one that was included, so I decided to give it a try and purchased it separately. What a bad decision. The Cola taste is very artificial, like the liquid form of a Cola Popsicle. However what really kills this flavor is the the "cherry" taste. It is like children's medicine, complete with a gross chemical aftertaste. I made two liters of this, using a bit less of the mix the second time. However this second batch was just as disgusting, so the rest of the mix went down the drain.<br /><br />Trust the reviews. However the Dr. Pepper equivalent(Dr. Pete) is actually quite good, so opt for that one instead.

review/summary: The Flavors
review/text: Okay this is my review on several flavors I tried.<br /><br />Cherry Cola - My gosh this one was horrid. I cannot believe I spent $4.99 on it. I love Cherry Coke but this is like a flat RC cola version of Cherry Cola. I will never get this one again. No way. There was this very bad aftertaste that lingered. Oh gosh no stars. No stars.<br /><br />Orange - Um, hmm. It is interesting. I cannot lay my finger on it but it is not my favorite. It isn't bad either. It didn't have an after taste to me. 2.5 stars for the orange.<br /><br />Diet Orange - Tried this one on April 1st. My gosh it has this odd after taste. To be honest I prefer the regular Orange one better. It is tolerable, but once this syrup is finished I will not get this one again.<br /><br />Diet Lemon Lime - Love loved it. It reminded me of 7 up. It is a bit strong but it is a great flavor to me. I know sodastream compared it to Sprite but I taste a strong 7-UP. 4 stars on this one.<br /><br />Energy one - Redbull all over that. I am not a redbull fan but this one screamed it. Not bad if you are a redbull fan. No stars from me on this one.<br /><br />Diet Rootbeer - This is a favorite of mine. This one reminds me of A&W rootbeer. No aftertaste and I dislike a drink with an aftertaste. 5 stars for this syrup.<br /><br />Dr. Pete - Aftertaste. Not that great. 1 star.<br /><br />Diet Dr Pete - Oh wow much better than the regular. Sort of reminds me of a knock of version of Dr. Pepper. 4 stars.

review/summary: One of my favorite flavors
review/text: We've had the Soda Stream for about 3 months now and sampled several flavors by now.  This Cherry Cola is one of my favorites.  It tastes like what you'd get ordering a cherry cola at a restaurant that ends up making it with XYZ brand cola and adding maraschino cherry juice, which I happen to like very much.  I prefer this flavor of "cherry" versus the big name brand cherry cola's.<br /><br />As a previous person shared, some of the flavors can be quite strong, so adding the "recommended" amount per instructions on the bottle might be too strong for you.  If that's the case, just mix in whatever you like.  That's the great part about this machine.  All the machine does is add carbonation, and you add whatever flavors you want, and in whatever "strength" you prefer!

I am HIGHLY allergic to ASPERTAME and while this is NOT listed as a "diet" soda, obviously it is or someone somewhere does not understand that aspertame contains quite a number of neurotoxins that are not healthy for the human body to ingest.  I believe that any product which uses aspertame as an ingredient should be required by law to indicate this is LARGE PRINT on the front of the container.  Sugar is a great deal safer.

review/summary: My family is obsessed with these pretzels!  If you like chocolate, caramel and pretzels - this is your holy grail!
review/text: I bought these on a whim because they were on sale on Amazon one day and I am SO glad that I did.  My family and I love chocolate, caramel and pretzels and this is the perfect mix of those flavors in a crunchy, salty-sweet treat.  Both canisters were properly sealed and the pretzels were fresh.  After being open for about a week they started to get a little stale but they were so popular with my kids that they didn't make it much past a week before they were devoured.  I can't say enough good things about these pretzels.  Also, we ordered them in the fall and even though we live in Florida, they weren't melted.  Good packaging Amazon!

When I saw them on Amazon's Manager's Special for approx. half the retail price I decided to give them a try.  They are fantastic!  The combination of caramel and the 3 chocolates make for a most unusual snack.  They are not overwhelmingly sweet either, just a nice balance of the thick pretzels and the candies  -- great with coffee or a latte.  Hope to see the peanut butter FunkyChunkys on Amazon soon!

For the pink, I will be sticking to buying white fondant and coloring it myself.<br />Colors aside, I found this fondant (both colors) easy to work with (once heated in the microwave) and maybe a little too soft and sticky as compared to other fondants, but still good for what I needed (some cut-outs and basic shapes, I had not covered a cake with this fondant).

review/summary: Great Coconut Milk
review/text: I have not purchased Thai Kitchen from Amazon however I will be needing some soon and probably will. With that being said I want to say I have been consuming Thai kitchen coconut milk on a daily basis. It is rich thick and delicious. Ingredients are coconut milk, water, and guar gum(thickener). It is comparable to native forest brand. Which I also enjoy, their serving sizes are diffeernt but after doing out the math I think the Native Forest has a slightly higher by 1% total fat per can. Doing a taste test to compare the two I don't notice a difference. So in the future I will buy whichever is cheaper. I live in Texas and this summer when I would open a can that had been in my pantry I didn't notice any chunks or anything but I could clearly see the oil, and it looked very rich (as well as tasted). Now that the temperature has cooled off outside to about 80 I notice a big difference. When I open the can it is very thick with many chunks. I am writing this because I read reviews where someone complained about this. IT'S A GOOD THING TO SEE!!!! It's the oil in the milk. As far as someone talking about the BPA in the cans, maybe they have since changed this. It is my understanding that you can see whan a can has a coating hence the cans that are white on the inside. These cans are not white they are just the plain old tin cans. If I am incorrect and there is a new way they are doing this, then I apologize. But my cans DO NOT appear to have any type of BPA lining.<br /><br />UPDATE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE ORGANIC BRAND WHICH MY LOCAL SPROUTS EVERY 3-4 MONTHS HAS ON SALE 2 CANS FOR 3 DOLLARS.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/9/2011:<br />I purchased a few cans of the Native Forest classic on sale & I have found myself reaching for it before the Thai Kitchen. I find it to be a bit smoother with a little bit of a milder flavor. It's cold right now so I open the cans from the bottom so the liquid (oil & water) are on top. I poured the liquid from each into measuring cups. The Native forest had exactly 8oz of liquid with the rest being solid cream. The Thai Kitchen had just over 5oz of liquid with the rest being solid cream.<br />With this being said, it all comes down to personal preference. If the price on Native Forest was comparable to Thai Kitchen I would buy Native. Otherwise I will buy the Thai Kitchen because the price is much more affordable and there's not enough of a difference in tase to make me want to spend more.

review/summary: Was Great but lately....
review/text: I ordered my first case of Organic coconut milk from Amazon after purchasing cans in a local Whole Foods - the first case was mostly great. A few dented cans, but overall - all the product was thick, creamy and full flavor.  The second case (purchased July 2011) has had mostly runny, watery and thin product. I can shake the rest of the cans and tell all of them are going to be runny. I am really bummed! I have contacted Thai Kitchen Headquarters with my complaints via their online form.  I suggest everyone with inferior product do the same, so that we can let them know we are NOT going to buy this inferior product anymore. Maybe (to cut costs/increase profit) they have added more water to the product? NOT ACCEPTABLE. Go to their website: w w w thaikitchen dot com  OR - write to them:<br /><br />Simply Asia Foods, LLC  P.O.

My complaint is about quality control in the packing plant.  6 of the 12 cans I received were dented, and the box they were packed in showed no damage to explain the dents, which means that they willfully put damaged cans in the box.  I am not able to return this item for a refund either, as it's not eligible under Amazon's refund policy, so I have no recourse.

review/text: I have been getting this brand for months now and have been very pleased. I can tell it's good quality coconut milk. If you want the cream to be the texture of whipped cream, do not put the can in the fridge until you're ready to open it. After it goes in the fridge, the cream will become harder due to the temperature.

review/text: I always liked the Russian Red Caviar, and I have decided finally to buy one online. The package came in time and was well packed. The caviar tasted good and fresh. The only necessary drawback was that, in order to preserve the freshness of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00424QGVC">Russian Red Caviar 20oz/560g Salmon Keta Roe</a>, I'm guessing, it was sent out frozen (there were some drops of water on the top of the cans), which eventually affects the the texture of the caviar. But overall the product was very good and I enjoyed the very last scoop of it. I would strongly recommend this dealer and product.

review/summary: Excellent, But I Prefer The Very Dark.
review/text: Not too long ago I discovered LU Petit Ecolier (Little Schoolboy) biscuits covered with a chocolate wafer. They came in three kinds: milk chocolate, dark chocolate and very-dark (70% cocoa) chocolate. Personally, I prefer the dark chocolate so I opted for a box of the very-dark chocolate variety. Oh, these were just sensationally good! I told my wife about them and had her try one. She liked it, but said she greatly preferred milk chocolate to the real dark stuff. Okay, it's a matter of taste. This time I bought a box of the milk chocolate ones to see if it would please her. It did. She preferred them and thought they were very good. Well, I'm sorry folks. I think the real dark ones are clearly superior and that's that! Actually, they're both excellent and it's just a matter of what you want (and who's rating it).<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: The Best Microwave Popcorn Available!
review/text: Most microwave popcorn tastes great when you eat it hot, but tastes greasy and bad when it is cool, because the hydrogenated oils used in the popcorn solidify once the popcorn cools.  However, this is not the case with Newman's Popcorn.  This popcorn tastes great, hot or cold because of the oils used.  Highly reccomended!

In fact, it's the same date code as the box sold from Amazon Warehouse Deals, and that sells for nine dollars less.  I should have gone with that, instead.<br /><br />Now I understand date codes are usually just a suggestion and the product is still good for a reasonable time after that date, but it does provide a pretty good indication of when the product was "made" and packed.  I feel like Amazon should be shipping fresher product for this premium price over their own Warehouse Deals - which seems to come from the same crate in their warehouse.

review/summary: Best I've Ever Had
review/text: I have eaten all kinds of popcorn for many years.  Many years ago, we made popcorn the old fashioned way; in a pot on the stove.  I remember it being crisp and crunchy.  Then, along came microwave popcorn.  I tried many different brands and none of them had the same crisp, and sometimes they were just plain mushy. I thought this was just a common attribute among microwavable popcorn products until several years ago when I tried making it the old fashioned way with the same results.<br /><br />What I have come to realize is, it's not how you prepare the popcorn, it's whether or not it's "organic."  The first time I tried "Newman's Own," it had that crisp and crunchy texture that I remembered from so many years ago.  Perfect!

review/text: In terms of microwave popcorn, I've been eating Newman's Own popcorn for nearly 25 years now. I've tried numerous other brands(Orville, ACT, Trader Joe's, Pop Secret etc) whenever I couldn't find it available and honestly none of them compare in terms of how well most all the kernels in an entire bag pop as well as not being too salty like most other brands out there. Unfortunately I'm only able to find it available at Whole Foods and the price difference per box after tax is about $.75 more compared to AMZN so it's probably better to buy per box for freshness sake as opposed to getting an entire case.

review/text: This popcorn has a distinctly different smell from the non-organic popcorn I'm used to.  It also tastes different, but not better.  Plus, I find more kernels unpopped over regular brands.  Update--I was going to try another brand.  I tried the Orville Redenbacher organic.  It was awful.  So in comparison, this Newman's Own brand in much better.  I'm buying it again, and now think that my previous order of this from Amazon may have been exposed to a lot of heat.  Hopefully, this time around I'll get a fresher batch.  If I could revise the stars above, I'd give it a 4.

I was told that they might be sold at 'Starbucks', but I quickly found that to be misinformation after searching them out at many of our local Starbucks (this is how much I wanted to find them!). I even searched various 'Whole Foods Markets'.  Unfortunately, they seem to only be found at Border Books (for now) and a few places on line.  They are Gluten-Free and are LOADED with wonderfulness (oats, honey, currents, dried cherries, goji berries, cocoa nibs, coconut, pumpkin seeds, cinnamon, etc.) These little treats are not only very hearty and delicious, but extremely satisfying. A perfect little snack between meals...I LOVE Kuko Bites!

review/summary: Ideal for making candy marzipan
review/text: This product contains more sugar than almonds, so it is sweet. It has four ingredients: sugar, almonds, invert sugar syrup, and natural flavor. Because of its sweetness and stickiness, it is ideal for making marzipan fruit candies or for cakes. Product arrived sealed in a fresh pack pop top can. It was moist and soft and consistently smooth throughout. Product is eligible for free shipping, and was shipped next day express. For better quality marzipan that is mostly almonds, I suggest Niederegger Weissbrot marzipan, if you want something you can eat as a snack as is. Products that have higher almond content and less sugar are always more expensive.

However, over the last year or so I have noticed that they are softer than they used to be, making them less suitable for helping to keep her teeth. I have expressed this concern to the manufacturer, but so far have not seen any improvement. I do wonder if the extra water is to add weight to the product.<br />This supplier got them to me quickly and at a better price than at the nearest store (25 minutes away) that stocks them, so I think UPS delivery is a greener option than driving to get them.

review/summary: Perfect Tea For Every Season
review/text: I first found this tea at an independent grocery store in the Fall.  I love pumpkin-flavored coffee and food so I figured this would be good.  It is fantastic IF you like a pumpkin spice flavor.  A cup of this satisfies my sweet tooth and I don't need dessert.  I finished the box a few months later and then couldn't find the flavor again.  I waited until Fall and still couldn't find it so finally got it on Amazon.  It was worth having to buy 6 packages; I gave a couple of gifts and just today (middle of May) I had a cup of it and loved it. It's a full-bodied tea and doesn't taste artificial.

And, although, I'm NOT an avid coffee drinker, I'd recommend this blend to individuals who aren't familiar with non-commercially, monopolizing brands.  This gives Folgers a run for its money and, quite frankly, ****'s all over Community. Lastly, I'd buy this blend again and again, if only to satiate the cravings that I get from it, that no other blends could provide. Thanks Kilambe!!

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: I am a big coffee drinker, and have traveled throughout Central and Latin America. All the countries I visit I try their coffee, some are good and some not so good, however when I visited Nicaragua I traveled to the mountain city of Matagalpa and tried Kilamb&eacute;, WOW! It was one of the best coffees I have ever tried, strong, very aromatic, and a very nice full bodied flavor. I liked it so much I brought 10 lb on the plane back to New Orleans with me and all my friends love it too, better then New Orleans chicory coffee. So I was so glad to see that it is finally being sold after a long wait in the United States.<br /><br />These beans are great and oily, any good Batista will know that a good roast will have the natural oils in coffee reveal themselves giving it a beautiful shine, and this is the only coffee I've found in the market that has the natural oils.<br /><br />These beans are great if you have a machine to grind them with, I prefer a fine grind for my espressos, but also do a coarser grind for my regular coffee and every time i grind the house fills up with the smell of coffee, I love it! I've made cappuccinos, macchiato, espresso, even coffee deserts lol. If you don't have a grinder they also have a ground coffee that their selling here that's just as good. I highly recommend this to any aficionados out there, its just delicious.

review/text: I have been using this product for about 6 months now. I am fighting Gall Bladder cancer, and was told not to drink coffee. The Dandelion Root Tea is a great alternative to coffee, for many reasons. No caffeine, it stimulates your liver, it really tastes a lot like coffee as well. I even have my boss hooked on it! He had to give up coffee for some health issues, and I let him try a bag, and now he drinks it daily! You have to brew it for 15 minutes to get all the flavor and benefits from it. I highly recommend it, it's good for you, and tastes enough like coffee to satisy your coffee craving.

review/summary: Great herbal tea!
review/text: Good for your liver. My past couple blood tests for my physicals were showing borderline elevated levels of liver enzymes and CRP, so I was in search for some natural cleansing remedies. I believe this tea helped me. I have not yet recieved another blood test to confirm, but I do feel more energy at work. Whether or not its psychological, it works in my favor. As for CRP levels, it was a sign of inflammation in the body and I knew exactly where the pain was (my hands and feet). I have also been drinking Moringa tea (also recommended) but as far as I know the painful inflammation is almost gone. Before the tea, I was using prescription anti-inflammatory painkillers but now have put a hold on the medicine since I am feeling better. Was it the tea? Maybe, but the good part is that I'm not relying on meds. Only time will tell, but for those in doubt, this is a tea very well worth the investment if you are looking for a natural remedy of sorts.<br /><br />The taste and aroma is best described as nutty, kind of like roasted peanut brittle with hints of tahini or sesame. What I like about this tea is that the longer you let it brew the more robust the flavor and nutrients extracted. This way, I can just leave the tea bag in the kettle as I boil the water and also in my tea pot, unlike other teas like green tea which gets real bitter if you steep it too long.<br /><br />UPDATE 3.29.2012 ***********<br />Since my first purchase, I have tried another brand, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7QY88">Alvita Tea Bags, Dandelion Root (Roasted), Caffeine Free, 30 tea bags (Pack of 3)</a> and have found Traditional Medicinals better to my liking. It provides a more richer flavor and a smoother aftertaste in my experience. Plus, each tea bag is individually wrapped for freshness and includes the draw string.<br /><br />I find the best time to enjoy this tea is early in the day. The bold, robust flavor of this tea seems to trick my body into thinking its coffee. I can drink to my heart's desire (or perhaps liver) and not have to worry about caffeine. It's a greay way to get that invigorating fresh brew without the jitters.

review/summary: Relief for edema, arthritis, cramps and more?
review/text: Amazon and its reviewers saved me again.  With my doctor on vacation and no refills on my diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) I was desperate for something. I am in my 30s but have terrible osteoarthritis in my knees - thank you soccer!  I could no longer see the bones or tendons in my feet because of fluid draining off of my knees and felt sluggish and miserable.  Heard about the tea and was very skeptical until I read reviews here from users.  I purchased immediately from a local store for about $7/box, tried one sachet and was not impressed.  The taste and smell are indeed coffee like and though I'm not a big coffee fan it grew on me.  It didn't work for me until a couple of days of continued drinking and using 2 sachets per 8 oz cup.  With one packet of splenda this tastes like an entirely different drink, kinda buttery and smoky.  I was skeptical about dandelion roots but apparently God put them here for a reason. :-)  I will not be going back on my diuretic, which is thrilling, and may be able to cut back on the prescription anti-inflammatories as well.<br /><br />Also, it could be coincidence but I seem to be experiencing relief with my arthritis and premenstrual cramps.  It's miracle tea!  I will be back to Amazon for my next purchase of this item due to the much better price.  My fiance heard it could have some benefits for diabetes and has started drinking it as well.  We both look forward to our tea time and will report back on any noticed befits with his blood sugar.

Then I started to buy it from my local Safeway, but they also stopped carrying it. Local health stores want $2 more than what Walmart and Safeway were charging. I did a search on Amazon and I was happy. The taste is nutty. Took a bit to get used to, but I am very glad I stuck with it. It has really helped me. I did all kinds of research on this product to gain insight (pros and cons) and to me the pros outweigh the cons. It has helped me lose weight by increasing bile production. Eased my osteoarthritis pain. Helps relieve my edema that I have in my left leg. I am a believer in this tea.<br /><br />*If you do try this tea, make sure you follow the directions on the box*

review/summary: It immediately stopped my desire for coffee !
review/text: I tryed this tea several months ago and it is excellent.  I have only one cup in the morning each day to get things flowing.  It is really good at that since it is a diuretic.  The box instructs you to use for 4 to 6 weeks and stop for a month.  I have followed these instruction and have no problems to report either good or bad.<br /><br />The big suprise was that after the second day of use my desire to have coffee completely stopped.  I can't explain this but a friend of mine also told me that he had the same results.  This just might be me alone but I have not had a cup of coffee for two months and do not desire to have coffee any more.  If you want to quit coffee you might want to try this tea to see if it has the same effect on you as well.

review/summary: Great tea!
review/text: I chose to try this tea as a help with water retention and other reviews suggested dandelion helps!  Although a different taste, I enjoyed the kind of roasted taste and often added another type of tea to the brew for added flavor (green tea, peppermint, ginger, and lemon all compliment well).  I followed the suggestion of using two tea bags per cup as I enjoy a stronger tasting tea and you could water it down if it was too strong.  I have not really paid attention to any benefits, but at the same time have not had any side affects (have noticed less water retention; ankles mainly).  I enjoy this tea hot or cold.

review/summary: Was surprised how much I like the taste!!
review/text: I have recently been reading about many of the benefits of dandelion tea - yes, including what Dr. Oz had to say about it as part of a weight loss regimen!!  Thus, I decided to give it a try...and it's good!  I think people say it has a coffee llike taste due to the roasted flavor that comes through.  To me it definitely still tastes like a tea, albeit a roasted one.  I say I was surprised how much I like the taste because, based on the smell of both the teabag and the brewed product, I thought it would be terrible.  The smell is not good but the taste really is.  I have had it both with 1 packet of Truvia and with a packet of truvia + a small amount of creamer and both variations are great!
