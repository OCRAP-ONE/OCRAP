review/text: Do NOT order this stuff.  I have ordered the VANILLA BEAN POWDER twice now and gotta VANILLA SMOOTHIE MIX both times!  The 2nd order was supposed to be the replacement for the incorrect 1st shipment.  NOPE, they sent the same stupid incorrect item.  Definitely getting a refund.  I didn't want Smoothie Mix, I wanted Vanilla Bean Powder!

review/summary: My Secret Ingredient!
review/text: I won't bore you with my (literally) award-winning chili recipe, but McCormick's Mexican Style Chili Powder is the most important part. There is NO substitute.  I have never had or made better chili, and - no kidding - I have won chili cook-offs.  If you think you might like it, try it.

review/summary: Use Review
review/text: I have used the product previously. I ordered this spice from Amazon. It is excellent for stews and chili.  The flavor is outstanding.  It is easily incorporated into the dish, enhancing the flavor.  It gives chili a spicy flavor without being a firey-hot sensation to the palate. It is especially an excellent season for meatless dishes, giving the dish a special flavor that enables those who usually eat meat to enjoy the dish without it.  I would highly recommend the product.

review/summary: Great new quencher
review/text: I will start by saying I can't drink anything else made by Crystal Light since artificial sweeteners disagree with me. So I was hesitant to try this, but with the disclaimers I decided to go for it.<br /><br />I must say that this is a very satisfying drink and solved my quest to get away from the more expensive drinks and sodas. Crystal light sure has scored a hit with a new, tasty drink with this one.<br /><br />My picky kids like it also, and that says a lot.

review/summary: Induced Nausea Side Effect
review/text: I'm trying to cut out soda and aspartame and so tried this as a substitute. Yesterday was my first day. I had 16 oz in the morning, and plain water for lunch. In the afternoon I made another 16oz bottle.<br /><br />By 2pm I was starting to get a headache. This was probably from caffeine withdrawal. I made another 16oz around 2:30 and could only drink half of it. I started to grow incredibly nauseous and had the flavor in my mouth like I get when I have too much diet soda. The headache intensified as well.<br /><br />I'm having the headache today as well so I blame the headache on the caffeine withdrawal, but the nausea and the overdosed soda flavor I blame on the Crystal Light Pure. I'm not feeling nauseous today and I've had no Crystal Light Pure.<br /><br />Drink this in moderation. Don't be like me and drink it all day. The flavor was excellent, if it weren't for the nausea I'd rate it 5 stars. But the awful feeling I got killed it.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/28/2012<br />I decided to give it another shot with the Lemonade flavor, unrelated to any caffeine ceasing. I added the packet to a 24oz bottle of water and I drank probably 6oz and started to feel nauseous. A quick google search reveals that vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea are common side effects of truvia/stevia based sweeteners. It's likely an allergy, where it will be fine for some people, but troublesome for others. WiseGeek has a particularly helpful article detailing the side effects. Give this guy a shot, but monitor your symptoms. I really wish Crystal Light would just product a low sugar version - I don't need it to be so sweet, just a touch of sweetener to add interest.

review/summary: Thoroughly enjoyable fitness drink at a reasonable price!
review/text: I don't usually like to spend money on fitness drinks, but I've really enjoyed Crystal Light Pure Fitness.  The grape flavor is refreshing, and the mix of electrolytes really do help you bounce back and rehydrate after a workout.  It's also a good subsitute for soda if you're trying to wean your family off sugary drinks!  Plus, the individual packaging is really sturdy, so you can toss a packet in your purse, briefcase, or bookbag, and not worry about spilling powder all over your belongings.  I would definitely recommend Crystal Light Pure Fitness to others -- my family's hooked!

I don't mind consuming artificial sweeteners, but I don't want my 2 year old daughter to have them. So, this is a great alternative to plain water. She loves it too! We live in Arizona and the added electrolytes is definitely a plus. There's only 3 grams of sugar per serving, which is much lower than the other fitness drinks out there.

review/summary: FINALLY!! A sports drink without corn syrup or artificial sweeteners!
review/text: Positives:<br />* Doesn't use artificial sweeteners or corn syrup<br />* Affordable - this costs so much less than buying Gatorade or Powerade!<br />* Better for you! Lower in calories than the more popular sports drinks.<br />* Tastes good as far as I'm concerned. I like it better than the other sports drinks I've tried. Tastes like regular Crystal Light from what I remember.<br />* Doesn't require you to purchase plastic bottle after plastic bottle of product, thus reducing your carbon footprint! BONUS!<br />* Not much packaging and it's really convenient to carry in your purse if you're a female.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Yes it does use sugar which kind of sucks, but I find that it does cut the Stevia which can have a bitter taste sometimes. And the amount of sugar used really isn't that high.<br /><br />Tips:<br />* Make sure to read the instructions as I didn't and put the entire packet in a 16.9oz bottle my 1st time. It's very strong when you do this. The packet's intended for 2 servings.<br />* I've gotten used to drinking nothing but water over the years so you could play with this a bit and use more water than they recommend. I use a 33.8oz bottle per packet typically but intend on buying some BPA-free reusable bottles and just keeping them premade in the fridge for a moments notice.

review/summary: Grape?  Really?
review/text: Didn't taste like grape to me, it tasted more like purple lemonade.  It has a very very faint artificial  'grape' taste, but seriously, if the drink didn't have a slightly purple tint to it and it wasn't labelled as such, you'd probably never suspect it was grape at all.  Now in all fairness, the flavor's not especially bad, but if it's lemonade you're after, why not just buy the Lemon Lime flavored 'Pure Fitness' powder - it's really quite good and as others have also mentioned, it doesn't cause the headaches that aspartame does.

review/text: As a former avid soda drinker, I love this stuff.  I really just can't stand plain water.  I'm off soda, and onto low sugar 30 calories per little pack.  I also won't do artificial sweetners, so all but the crytal light "PURE" products are out.  Stevia is an all natural sweetner.<br /><br />Better yet, rather than mix this with 16 oz as suggested, I mix one packet in a whopping 40oz klean kanteen, and I would say it tastes like a light kool aid.  It's enough to keep me hydrated all day, it's cheaper than soda, its better for me than soda. 10 lbs down with this being pretty much the only change to my daily routine- who can complain about that?

review/summary: If you're diabetic or on a low-sugar diet (like South Beach), don't buy this!!
review/text: For whatever reason, the sugar in this product isn't mentioned in the advertising.  If you check the ingredients, the 1st one listed is evaporated cane juice, which is sugar, although a natural form of it, and sugar (the regular kind) is also listed a few ingredients later.  I was excited about buying this product because I believed it was a Truvia-only sweetened product (which i prefer to artificial sweeteners).<br />However, I definitely won't be purchasing it because it contains sugar and Truvia.  A 70 gram container (a whole box) contains 210 calories - all from sugar.  To some people this may not seem like much, but to others who consume lots of drinks sweetened with Truvia or artificial sweeteners, it can be a problem not knowing about it.<br />If you're diabetic or on a low-glycemic diet, you'd be better off buying unsweetened Kool-aid and adding Truvia to it.  Why the company decided to do this is beyond me - Truvia tastes fine on it's own.<br /><br />Here is the nutrition information for this product from their website:<br />crystal light - fitness drink mix - grape pure fitness on the go 0.31 oz<br /><br />Ingredients: EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, CITRIC ACID, MALIC ACID, MALTODEXTRIN, CALCIUM LACTATE, SUGAR, CONTAINS LESS THAN 2% OF NATURAL FLAVOR, REBIANA (TRUVIA BRAND SWEETENER), POTASSIUM CITRATE, MAGNESIUM OXIDE, SODIUM CITRATE, SALT, DRIED PURPLE CARROT EXTRACT AND DRIED HIBISCUS FLOWER EXTRACT (FOR COLOR).<br /><br />[...]

review/text: This Grape has a tart flavor on purpose, and at first I thought this had too much tart flavor for my liking; however, after drinking it for awhile, I became to really think this is a refreshing drink.  I like this "Pure Fitness" new line of drinks from Crystal Light; it is a welcome product line that has no artificial sweeteners.  Instead it has a little sugar and natural Stevia plant sweetener (this is better than regular soda for Diabetics, but there is still a little sugar).  I like the Strawberry Kiwi and Lemon-Lime flavors as well.  Since these debuted, this is the only Crystal Light I have been purchasing from now on.

I really hate being ripped off and that's exactly what I was.<br /><br />I like Amazon and whenever I need something, this is the first place I check out, then Ebay.<br /><br />I will be very aware and sure of what I'm paying in the future.

Just the right balance of saltiness, very crunchy of course, and just overall good taste. Fantastic with medium to strong cheeses. I love how this good taste is found in something that is whole grain and baked.<br /><br />The only downsides I can find is that they are so easy to snack on, I keep having to go back and purchase more.

review/summary: The best crackers I have EVER eaten
review/text: These crackers are AMAZING.  I tried them as a free sample, topped with a small piece of brie cheese, at a Sam's Club store.  I expected them to taste like any other multigrain cracker, but was blown away by how good the sample was.  I immediately bought a box, and literally crave and look forward to eating them, which is not something I thought I would ever say about a cracker.<br /><br />Saying that they taste like corn nuts, as the previous reviewer did, might turn some people off.  They're not really like corn nuts, but they have a pleasant savory non-wheat grain/seed flavor, as do corn nuts.  The base is brown rice meal, which is mixed with a variety of seeds (sesame, quinoa, amaranth, flax) and tamari soy sauce powder.  The soy sauce is almost imperceptible and complements the other flavors well - it gives the cracker just a slight savory flavor, not a noticeable "soy sauce" flavor.  Other multigrain crackers, even high quality crackers, lose their flavor as they are chewed, and end up tasting bland or even doughy.  These keep their flavor - a deep grainy, savory flavor.  I am pretty sure they would appeal to both cracker lovers and those who like to snack on chips.<br /><br />These crackers are excellent topped with brie cheese, dipped in salsa, or eaten plain.  The brown rice meal base means that the crackers are crunchy and hold up to liquids better than wheat crackers do.  They're low sodium, gluten-free, and low calorie - you can eat 15 for 140 calories, and 15 of these makes a satisfying snack.  What's not to love?  I do not make a point to eat gluten-free items, but these are absolutely delicious for anyone.<br /><br />Just a snack idea - for 240 calories, you can eat 1 ounce of brie, and 15 crackers.  Believe it or not, 1 ounce of brie can be divided among 15 crackers and each bite is satisfying.<br /><br />By the way, I only paid $7 or $8 for this size box at Sam's Club.  I love these crackers so much and find them to be so unusual in flavor that I plan to buy boxes for several family members.  They make a wonderful "go to" healthy snack for anyone who is trying to lose weight, gluten-free diet or not.<br /><br />Note - these are FULFILLED by Amazon, NOT SOLD by Amazon.  The beef about the price should be taken up with the actual seller.

review/text: As a picky Celiac also avoiding oats, my nutritionist recommended these crackers. I bought them hoping they would be more chip-like, to eat with salsa or bruschetta, but they are truly crackers. They're best with cheese or hummus. Crunchmasters' certainly has the crunch factor down, a feature impressing even non-Celiacs! One box contains two bags of crackers, enough to last you awhile. These are definitely a great option for Celiacs looking for a different, satisfying cracker that has some nutritional value (quinoa and sesame contribute some fiber and protein!).

review/summary: Fabulous crackers but what's up with the price, Amazon?
review/text: This are fabulous tasting crackers. I eat them all the time. But I would NOT pay $14 for them. What's up with Amazon? Sam's Club charges about $7.50 for the same product. I'm shocked by this outrageous price when Amazon prides itself on offering good value. Buy these crackers...just don't buy them from Amazon until they adjust the price by about half.

review/summary: I'm addicted to these!
review/text: As other reviewers have noted they are less than half the price at either costco or sam's club. They are so tasty that I eat them when I have an urge for a crunchy salty snack like potato chips or pop-corn or really for no reason. For me they easily take the place of any wheat based cracker that I would use in soups or for tuna salad or cheese. The real hard part is not finishing off almost one of the bags once opened. You consume 2G of dietary fiber and 3G of protein per 15 crackers which is a serving size for 140 calories. Noteworthy they are made in the USA. I'll count the next time I snack, but in all honesty I think I eat about 30 as one snack usually w/ some form of Cabot's cheese. I enjoy trying different types of food items, but if you are a staunch saltine or Ritz cracker fan, these may not be for you. They are very thin, crunchy, have a salty nutty like flavor and I can faintly taste the soy sauce. Since there is no expiration date on the box (odd I know) I will stock up while I can get them locally at such a low price. The only packaging part I don't like is the 2 cellophane bags are not resealable. The cardboard box is very sturdy and does not crush easily so they are well protected if you are considering ordering online.

review/text: A lot of gluten free crackers can be kind of soft, like Club or Townhouse crackers. I really wanted some CRUNCH, so I figured what better to try than a brand called "Crunchmaster." Glad I did - they're super crunchy and salty and don't fall apart if you spread them with cheese or peanut butter. They're a little nutty and seedy, but I really enjoyed the flavor. Comes with two individually wrapped bags

review/text: These crackers are very tasty!  Lots of rich, nutty flavor, and they are "sturdy" meaning they stand up to salsa, cream cheese, etc.  I dip them in everything!  They ARE less expensive at Sams Club and Costco, but for people who don't live close to one of those stores, I'd highly suggest buying them on Amazon.  I've been Gluten-Free since 2007 and these crackers are in my top 5.  Glutino tastes bland and dry to me, and while we have a local GF bakery that makes DIVINE crackers, Crunchmaster is always a staple in our household.

review/text: which can be a bad thing!  :-)  this review is for anyone who has tried San-J sesame brown rice crackers but not these and you're wondering if you'll like them.  i tried to do a taste test but when i ate the crunchmaster i liked it best then when i ate the san-j i liked it best.  :-)<br /><br />the san-j has a somewhat more intense flavor (tastes like more soy sauce or stronger soy sauce to me) and definitely has a denser texture<br /><br />crunchmasters are light, airy, and crispier...also very satisfying (and also yummy)<br /><br />i like the purity of san-j ingredients better (only sesame, brown rice, rice flour, san-j tamari soy sauce, sweet potato starch) but crunchmaster has some good seeds/grains and the latter has more fiber.  (wish it didn't have safflower oil and maltodextrin, tho.)<br /><br />i have only found san-j in the 3.7 oz size for about $4 so they are much more expensive.<br /><br />and yes you really can get crunchmaster for half the amazon price at costco but if, like me, you live in the middle of the city with no car, amazon is the place!  buy 2 boxes and free shipping so that beats driving and spending money on gas anyway!

review/text: We had these for the first time at a friends house and thought they tasted great, we didnt know that they were gluten free nor was that a concern for either of us, but it is an added plus since we can serve them to any guests who need to be on a gluten free diet. They go great with all types of cheese and my husband eats them straight out of the bag as a healthy alternative to chips. My only complaint is that they are a bit pricey when you factor in the shipping cost.

I put them out for the squirrels and they wouldn't touch them either!(it's January in Mich.)

My favorite for spread and cheeses is the Glutino Cheese which has just hint of cheese flavor.

review/summary: Taste better than most gluten-free BUT grossly over-priced
review/text: Like many people who are gluten-intolerant, I have many other food sensitivities that are not related directly to gluten.  These crackers have dehydrated tamari sauce in them. The tamari is what gives the crackers a great taste; I suspect this is what some reviewers decide is 'burnt grain'. However in my case tamari is a trigger for interstitial cystitis pain.  I would normally deduct only two stars for this, since my food sensitivities are not the fault of this maker; HOWEVER, the price is absolutely absurd.  I have no clue why anyone would pay this much for a $6-$7 box of crackers.  Check your local health food store.  Such stores are notorious for price-gouging, but even so they will be radically cheaper than here.

Amazon price is higher, but I have a 7 week olf and a 3 year old, so it will be handy to have these delivered to my door rather than drive an hour each way to Costco.  They are wheat free and dairy free.  They are very crunchy but are not too hard (my 3 year old can bite and chew easily).  They go great with all manner of toppings.  I use them for breakfast with Earths Balance and some marmalade.  I love them with olive tapendade.  But honestly, I often find myself standing at the kitchen counter just eating them right out of the bag.  They even kill my popcorn cravings.  Great product...in fact, I think I will go get some right now....

I am an avid Amazon shopper have had prime memebership for shipping since it came out. I buy 2 - 3 times a week.  I was shocked to see the high price for these on Amazon when I bought the box with the twin packs in Sams for much much less.  If Amazon wants to carry these fantastic crackers and expects people to buy them, they need to lower their price.

Both are VERY strong (needed any kind of cheese or meat to help dilute the flavor -- and I'm the person that quadruples the amount of garlic in recipes), but the texture is nice, and since the multigrain doesn't have such overpowering spices, I'm guessing it's pretty good.

review/summary: best gluten-free crackers on the market
review/text: Yes! Yes! Yes! to the product.<br /><br />No! No! No! to the price here. The club price is less than half of this. Obviously this company is buying them and then reselling. Just a few boxes pays for your yearly membership.<br /><br />There are two varieties, regular and five seed, which we like better. So good.

review/summary: Best cracker every made
review/text: This is not the best gluten-free cracker, its the best cracker period.  I'm not even sure what gluten is, and its absence is not why I'm recommending these things.  Why are they good?  First, they are very crunchy, almost like a tortilla chip.  Second, the flavor is unique- its a great cornut/toasted sesame seed flavor that is appealing even without a dip, and perfectly straddles being bland and being over-powering.  Its also has just a slightly salty taste that becomes addictive.  Third, regardless of if you are needing a gluten-free product, this is a healthy snack.  No sugar, low sodium, no trans-fats.  It does have 5g of fat, but thats better than most stuff you will find.<br /><br />I was at Sams and they were providing samples of these crackers, and a line 5 deep had formed they were so popular.  And yes, they are much cheaper at Sams.  Wherever you order them, buy multiple bags, because you will go through them fast.

review/text: Don't let the little whiff of Tamari soy sauce put you off when you first open the package. These crackers are good, crunchy and when you miss things because of the gluten you don't have to miss crunchy crackers anymore - these are wheat and gluten free! I often use them with mustard and Swiss cheese for little cracker snacks. They have become a staple in my kitchen that I use frequently.

review/summary: Taste AMAZING!!! BEST gluten-free crackers I've found!
review/text: I am so excited to find a gluten free item that tastes completely 'normal.' No sacrifice of texture, taste or quality here! These crackers should receive an award.<br />After trying Mary's Gone Crackers several times, which are tasty, I literally chipped a tooth on one of the grains (I think it was the quinoa) that are spread throughout those crackers and have the consistency of dried up rice (hard as tiny evil rocks).<br />Anyway, I knew there had to be something better out there, than trying to munch petrified grain.<br />I dabbled with the Sesmark brand of gluten free crackers (also tasty) and these were satisfying, and NOT painful to eat (thank goodness). And you can get those even at Target, which makes them a convenient choice in a pinch. But they still lacked a little something, and were a little too salty.<br />But ... I have found my favorite cracker! Crunchmaster Multigrains are the winner! Holy smoke not only are they delicious, not only do they taste like totally normal completely delicious crackers, they also appear to possibly even be good for you (I am wary to label anything not homemade these days 'nutritious').<br />I can't wait to feed these to my family, because only Crunchmaster and I will know they're gluten free. Don't hesitate to buy if you're longing for some gluten-free cracker goodness!<br />They remind me somewhat of the crackers Sociables, which are super tasty but not gluten free. They don't look anything like Sociables, but they have a loosely similar flavor.<br />Even if you're not restricted to eat only gluten free, I still highly recommend these crackers. They are sooo good, and say they're low in sodium and have omega fatty acids.<br />Amazon's price IS literally twice as high as you can find them in a warehouse store (Sams, Costco etc) but I would imagine it's from the shipping cost, since most who order these probably take advantage of the free super saver shipping by combining them with other items from Amazon, and it probably would cost about 5 to 7 bucks to ship these anywhere. The crackers themselves come in a big sturdy box. Still, even at $14, it's not an absolutely horrible price ... you do get a lot of crackers. If the price were to be reduced to $11, I think that would be a good deal on here. But, just my 2 cents.<br />If they lower the price by a buck or two, I may still order them from Amazon in the future, for the times I can't bear to drag myself to Costco. Nothing better than food I didn't have to actually "shop" for.

review/text: These crackers are crisp, flavorful and are great alone or with other foods. They have their own distinct flavor so they don't go with everything that might sit on a cracker.  I like them but would like to find a more plain gluten-free cracker as well.  These cost more than if bought at Sam's Club, but if you, like I, don't live near a Sam's Club the price difference is less than gas for a trip. G. Collins

These crunchy crackers are extraordinary.  I just wish they were more readily available in grocery stores.

review/summary: Not for My Taste Buds
review/text: I have only found a few gluten free crackers I like, this IS NOT one of them. I purchased these at Sam's Club, much cheaper. These crackers were hard, not crunchy, almost seemed stale. The first bite didn't taste too bad but they left an awful, odd after-taste, similar to burned grain. The texture wasn't too bad, not the usual prepackaged gluten-free grainy texture. My husband went Gluten-Free when I had to, he almost almost anything and he doesn't like them either. We tried them plain, with cream cheese, with cream cheese/olives, in salad, with cheddar cheese, nacho cheese but nothing would conceal the after-taste, in my opinion they were Horrible! I would say it is just my taste buds but...I not 1 of my 5 kids, 4 of which will eat pretty much anything, liked these. We offered them to friends, family, and neighbors but after trying them no one would take them. It could be possible that we purchased a bad batch, there were 2 packages in the box, but I don't think we want to chance buying and wasting another box. After reading some of the other reviews it appears many people love them, I guess you never know unless you try them. We hated to toss them in the trash so we occasionally used them as dog treats, the dogs did like them.

review/summary: CRUNCHY, TASTY, AND GOES WITH EVERYTHING
review/text: I first discovered these crackers at a friend's house; her son had bought them in Tennessee. She served them with 3 kinds of cheeses and they were the hit of the Mahjong game! Since then, I have been looking all over for these crackers and LUCKILY FOUND THEM FROM THIS SELLER! Other sellers (well, 1 actually), took the order through Amazon and weeks later emailed me to say they couldn't sell me the product because the state of Virginia has strict rules on shipping food. BULL you know what! This seller had no problems getting the product to me. They were quick to ship, the crackers are strong enough to withstand shipping and 99% of the product arrives as a full cracker. Although I have no problems with wheat products, my guests were very impressed and happy to have a GLUTEN FREE product that tasted so good! These crackers are also great as a midnight snack. My husband is always getting up in the middle of the night looking for something healthy to snack on...these crackers are always available. So THANK YOU to this seller for providing a high quality and very good tasting product. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER!!!

review/summary: Inconsistent quality of bully sticks...somewhat disappointed
review/text: I find your picture of the bully stick product misleading, for what we had received was inconsistent bully stick product. Your photo shows sticks of somewhat similar thickness and length, and we got all sorts of sizes in our packs (Five one pound packages bought---our dogs love to chew).  Some were skinny and stringy, and while others were on the hollow side.  Furthermore, some were very stubby and short.  I have dogs of medium size, and I feel I cannot give them some of the product due to size, skinniness, and quality.  Yes, it is still a pound of bully sticks, but I believe Cadet should be a little choosier about what they are throwing off to a customer. I have bought one pound packages at Costco of Cadet Bully Sticks and they were of much higher quality and somewhat consistent in size, and rarely did we find hollowish ones in the packs sold there.  I feel misled that Cadet Bull Stick one pound packages sold at Amazon would be of like quality.  No comparison.  The ones sold at Costco were far superior to the shoddier product I just bought.

review/summary: wrong quantity
review/text: The package did not contain what they promised.  It is hard to speak to a live person.  Everything is done via email.  I feel as though I am a victim of false advertising.

review/summary: Large bully sticks.
review/text: My dogs love these.  There are about 14 per package.  Me female Boxer can chew through one in 5-10 minutes.  My male Boxer can chew through one in 10-20 minutes.  They do not last long at all.  These are cheaper than the ones I have found around town.  I hope to find an alternative to rawhide that last just as long as rawhide.
