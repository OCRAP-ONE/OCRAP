review/summary: Vegetarian fast food, needs better package
review/text: This product is packaged in a tin that has a "paperish" pull off top. Why he maker doesn't use microwavable containers is a mystery. The couscous is tasty and has a nice mix of seasoning, but heating it really improves the flavor a great deal. The metal containers also make the weight much greater, a consideration when packing for travel.<br /><br />Still, it's a nice convenience food for those wanting wholesome vegetarian food in a hurry or on the road. I take it out of the tin and put it in a microwavable safe bowl and zap it for about a minute to bring out the better taste. Serving suggestions to make it even better: mix in 1 to 2 tablespoons of your favorite raw nuts or seeds before heating. My favorites to complement the couscous are cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, Spanish peanuts or sesame seeds. Also try tossing the warmed couscous with 1/4 to 1/2 cup of chopped fresh spring onions, arugala or parsley.<br /><br />For better packaged on-the-go grains look at "Annie's Rice Express" products (my favorite is the sprouted brown rice) and "Go Go Rice". These each have a variety of fast vegi-food with light weight microwavable containers and have organic grains available. The St. Dalfour foods are worth buying, especially if you enjoy couscous for a nice change from rice.

review/summary: Filling and nutritious
review/text: I purchased this item as one of several to take on a train trip, and ordered extra so that I could try it at home to check it out in advance.<br /><br />The Couscous is shelf-safe and can be eaten either at room temperature (which is how I tried it) or heated.<br /><br />The flavor is strong and I chose to eat this meal with soda crackers on the side which helped offset the somewhat overpowering flavor. I also added an ounce of cheddar cheese to supplement the meal, and a cinnamon cookie to finish it off. Together, they made a nice combination and meal at home.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the salad at home, and would enjoy it either as a lunch or dinner, I have some concern about eating it on the train ... I am concerned that the powerful flavor would be a bit much while "in motion." So I will be keeping this particular salad for a quick meal at home or in my office.<br /><br />But I do recommend it, whether you make your choice as a vegetarian or simply to try a new side dish for your meat. It does work nicely as a side to chicken.<br /><br />195 calories per serving - two servings in a package.

review/summary: Surpassed my expectations.
review/text: So I think we've all had our share of canned food nightmares.  I once lived in the barracks at Ft Hood TX, on separate rations, and for many situations was forced to live on cold canned food.  So hearing "gourmet" and other claims always is taken with a grain of salt.<br /><br />I just tried this product for the first time today, and am very pleasantly surprised.  The honey is quite a nice touch, the fact that there's just enough space in the can to mix and fluff the product, and the flavor is as good as anything I've had on the fresh side of things.  The small fork like utensil that comes with each can is just the right size for easy consumption and fits back into the can for disposal.  Portion size is just right for me, consuming both "servings".<br /><br />If i were hard pressed to improve this, i'd throw a few dried cranberries (not many) and some pistachio nuts in, however that in no way says this is lacking in any way.<br /><br />Great stuff, especially for ~$2 a can compared to fast food options or other convenience food.  And a LOT better than the chemicalized canned options out there.

review/summary: Gourmet to Love!
review/text: I first discovered Gourmet on the Go at my local "Giant Eagle" grocery store and took a chance on it. I wanted to find something that I could grab in the morning to take to work and still be a healthy alternative. I must admit that I have not been disappointed. I looked online for it and found that Amazon has the best prices for it along with a variety to select from. I bought Cous Cous, Three Bean and Salmon varieties. I really like the Salmon the best, but they are all very good. Just like the name says, Gourmet on the Go... you really can take this anywhere - work, hiking/camping, afternoon snack. I really like the convenience of a meal such as this. I eat it at room temperature right out of the can. I like the packaging. It comes with a spork (spoon/folk combo) and salt/pepper, and a seasoning packet.

review/text: Even if it came in a plastic container, I'd remove the food to microwave it. So I'm fine with the can: it can be recycled. The spork that it comes with is completely irrelevant; I can't imagine using it to successfully put food in my mouth.<br /><br />The food itself is excellent. I had one serving at room temp over raw spinach, which was great, and another for breakfast, heated, with the honey that it comes with, and I'm sold. The flavors and textures are great.<br /><br />To the reviewer that didn't care for the product, you can send yours to me!

review/summary: Yuck.  Just yuck.
review/text: This is the third flavor of St. Dalfour's gourmet on the go I have tried.  The first two were fairly decent.  I wouldn't say that they are my favorite meals ever, but they are reasonably tasty, convenient, and healthy.<br /><br />Therefore, I was expecting the same when I ordered the Couscous flavor.  The first time I tried to eat it, I took two bites and threw the rest of the can away.  The second time around, I only tried it because I could not believe it could possibly be as disgusting as I remembered.  It was.  That can and the rest of the cans ordered (cause, hey, this is a pack of 6) were thrown away immediately.  I couldn't even put the cans away for emergency food in case of apocolypse because I'm pretty sure I would rather starve to death than eat this nasty stuff again.

review/text: *****<br /><br />Temple of Heaven Gunpowder Green Tea is a premium Numi tea. It is a low-caffeine green tea, is certified organic, and is kosher.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "Our whole leaf Temple of Heaven - Gunpowder Green Tea is gently steamed within hours of being plucked, then skillfully hand rolled into small tight pearls. This process preserves its delicate flavor and aroma far longer than other green teas. Steeped in hot water, the leaves unfurl, releasing a well-rounded, full-bodied flavor. Rich in fluoride, calcium, and anti-oxidants - and with very little caffeine - this is a perfect choice to greet the evening."<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love green tea, or want a green tea that you can drink in the evening, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.<br /><br />*****

First 3 of my rocks are a bright turquoise color not a brown, gray or earthy color.  I also only got 11 rocks.  Stating only the ounces on this listing is ridiculous when the picture looks like "pebbles"  I knew I was only getting a couple of ounces but at the pebble size it would have been enough for my project.  Instead I have eleven rocks.  I have small hands and I can fit all of them in one hand.  It's definatly not enough for most projects.  The candy rocks do look realistic though.

This is the old, trusted brand my grandmothers always used, and eventually my local grocery stores stopped carrying it, so I had to seek it online.

In addition, I also put a few stalks of lemongrass to boost the flavor.  Overall, the flavor is great.  So much better than the Quoc Viet Soup base.

review/summary: Not white chocolate, but tasty and lower in fat/calories
review/text: Ghirardelli doesn't include "chocolate" in this white sauce's name for a reason:<br /><br />Unlike white chocolate which consists of cocoa butter, condensed milk, and sugar, Ghirardelli "Classic White Flavored Sauce" consists of high fructose corn syrup, sugar, food starch, and carrageenan (which makes the sauce thick and creamy). The sauce contains no cocoa butter, and its unspecified dairy flavors are way down the list of ingredients.<br /><br />in short, this sauce gives my coffee drinks, hot chocolate, and desserts a sweet and creamy consistency with a flavor similar to vanilla or, more accurately, doughnut or pastry frosting.<br /><br />The good news: Unlike real white chocolate, this is fat-free, it's marginally lower in calories, and it pours easily.<br /><br />For a more authentic white-chocolate sauce -- including the saturated fat and additional calories -- try Fontana White Chocolate Mocha Sauce. It contains all the key ingredients of real white chocolate; it's Starbucks' choice for the coffee chain's white-chocolate drinks; and (contrary to the sauce's name) it does NOT contain "mocha" (coffee).<br /><br />If you buy Ghirardelli's sauce in the 64-ounce bottle, be sure to pay less than $20 for it. Some vendors grossly overcharge.

review/summary: Best sauce for white mochas I have found
review/text: I've tried just about every sauce out there, trying to duplicate the "Starbucks" style iced white chocolate mochas. The Torani sauce is close, but I tried the Ghirardelli sauce, and it's by far my favorite and the one I will stick with from now on. It doesnt like Starbuck's white mochas, but exactly like the other coffee shop's that I frequent, which I prefer. So if your looking for Starbucks equivilent look elsewhere, but this is definitely worth trying.<br /><br />Like others have said it has a taste of its own, which I happen to like better than any other sauce I've tasted. It was the last one I tried, because it seemed to have the worst, or at least mixed "love it or hate it" types of reviews. I happen to love it, but taste is simply a matter of opinion so you will have to see for yourself.<br /><br />This does come with a pump so don't waste your money like I did and pay two (it should say this in the description, at this time it does not).<br /><br />I had some problems with pumps not holding their prime at first, but finally got one that works perfectly. If you have any problems, Ghirardelli customer service is great and quick to help you.

review/text: This is the syrup they use to make white chocolate hot chocolate and various drinks at Cinnabon.  Since moving to AZ, I have not been able to find a Cinnabon location that sells anything with "white" chocolate--so I started searching on my own for it!  Shipping was very fast, and when I purchased the bottle, I did NOT have to buy a separate pump--it came with one.  Pump is well constructed.  I have had zero problems with it sticking or not pumping the proper amount of syrup.  I have also had several friends over to enjoy and they just raved. Yum!

review/summary: Disappointing results
review/text: I found this sauce to be underwhelming in flavor, all sweetness with a less than lovely aftertaste.  I tried smaller and smaller amounts in my espresso and could never get a comparable result to using the ghiradelli chips.  Also, the companion pump didn't keep it's prime and had to be pumped several times to be reprimed every day and so the amount released was inconsistent which made it difficult to "measure" easily.  (1 pump, 1/2 pump, etc)<br />One ounce in an espresso was VERY strong and not pleasant, and a half ounce is just sweet without a white mocha flavor.

review/summary: Just like Starbucks, in my opinion
review/text: I find very little difference at all between this and Starbucks. Perhaps it's because I gave up Starbucks when I gained the ability to make these at home and the comparison isn't there for me anymore? not sure, but really, I found this to be highly comparable with Starbucks.  It's not too sweet either.<br /><br />I've ordered a few of the 64 oz bottles and something I don't like is that when they arrive, the bottoms are bowed out and they don't sit squarely on the table.  I was weary at first because sometimes when products go bad, the packaging becomes misshaped but I went ahead and used it and all 3 containers had perfectly fine/safe contents.

review/summary: COST OF PUMP IS MORE ?
review/text: Chocolate is great for my morning mochas, but seriously to charge extra for the pump is obsurd, luckily i live near Ghiradelli so go buy it directly from the sorce an everytime they include free pump, i mean seriously how else are you supposed to use it ?  though have washed pump an placed in each new bottle.  An price is cheaper directly from the source so if you live in or are visitng San Francisco go visit Ghiradelli but if not just remember take the pump apart an wash it so you don't have to buy new ones each time you buy the syrup.

My poor Nonna Lucia could not keep a wedge in her humble Bronx home without my sister and I devouring it piece by piece until only a tiny chip was left sitting in the fridge -- much to everyone's dismay when it was time to put the cheese on the table to go with Nonna's homemeade spaghetti (LOL.I can laugh now....).<br /><br />Nonna eventually took to hiding the Parmigiano until The Right Culinary Moment came.<br /><br />This cheese has a wonderful grainy texture, a VERY good "Mouth" feel to it, and is bursting with sparks of intensity. Why wait for the grater? Take out the Chianti or the Merlot, cut a hunk or two from the wedge, and enjoy this cheese -- now!!

review/summary: A great decaf version of my favorite K-Cup coffee
review/text: After trying dozens of bold coffees for my Keurig I settled on the caffeinated version of this coffee as my standard morning beverage.  I brew it in the 7 oz. size and have 3 or 4 cups as I start my day.  However, there are times when the caffeine is not welcomed, especially anytime after 5 or 6 PM.  That's when this coffee comes into play.  I enjoy the aroma, the body and the flavor, although it is not as deep or rich as the regular one.  Still, a very good decaf.

It tastes old, like it's been sitting for hours after brewing.  Not sure what Tully's did differently but now I'm stuck with 6 boxes of undrinkable k-cups because Amazon doesn't take returns on food.  Ugh!!  The "sell by" date on my boxes is March 2012.

review/summary: The Best Keurig K-Cup Coffee I've Found So Far
review/text: Tully's French Roast K-Cups make the best coffee I've so far tasted from a Keurig Coffee Maker.  There are many good coffees out there, but to my taste the French Roast has the kick I need.  Because of an attenuated sense of taste (autoimmune problems) I need coffee that has more than the average kick so that I can actually taste the coffee, and Tully's does the job.  My wife, who possesses normal, or beyond a normal sense of taste, agrees with me that this is excellent coffee.  No, it's not for those who like a mild tasting coffee, but unlike a comment I read in another review, it doesn't taste at all like an ashtray smells....not at all!  This is seriously good coffee, and if you like strong tasting coffee, give this a try.  I doubt that you'll be disappointed.*****UPDATE***** It's been about 2 years since I started using Tully"s French Roast K-Cups, and I thought I might add to my original comments.  Having tried at least 3 other brands of French Roast coffee, from San Francisco Bay, to Starbucks, and one other brand, the name of which escapes me at the moment, and I can say that Tully's makes the best of the four.  San Francisco Bay is a close number 2, but Tully's beats it out.  It is hard for me to believe that Starbucks would come in number 3 in a taste test, but it did.  If you like French Roast, by all means try the others if you like to experiment, but if not, take my recommendation and go with Tully's French Roast.  You won't go wrong.  It is a perfect cup of coffee every time!

review/summary: Strong and Bold, But Still Certainly Bitter
review/text: While the French Roast tastes nice with cream and sugar (as does almost any coffee,) the Tully's brand of French Roast served black is almost flavorless aside from its bitter aftertaste. Nearly every K-Cup tastes good served with cream and sugar; French Roast tastes poor when served black. I suggest another flavor.

review/summary: Just OK: Strong Coffee, Bitter Aftertaste
review/text: I prefer strong coffee with a smooth taste.  Tully's French Roast is strong but has a bitter aftertaste that only goes away if you use half-and-half (the bad coffee transformer).  It's just bad for your cholesterol and waistline if you use it every day, just to finish the batch of coffee I bought.<br /><br />My favorite was Coffee People Organic K-Cups but it's no longer available.  The second best is Coffee People Donut Shop K-Cups, but they're more expensive then Tully's French Roast (at Costco).

review/text: I love Tully's coffee, I have tried several different blends & find then exceptional. The Italian & French blends have a wonderful flavor.  The Breakfast & House blends are not as bold but have a wonderful flavor as well. I have not tried the Tully's labeled "Kona" coffee, but I am sure it is great as well. I highly recommend this coffee. (VLS)

review/summary: YES! FINALLY A GOOD K-CUP!
review/text: I had almost given up on my Keurig when I stumbled upon this one in the variety pack that came with the machine. Finally, something that tasted like REAL coffee! Bold, rich, balanced, delicious. If you like bold coffee this is a must try. I was pretty disappointed in the other K-cups I sampled. They all seemed somewhat watery and lacking in any texture or body. Tully's French Roast is the first I've tried that approximates a freshly ground cup of strong coffee. It's smoky and intense and overall very satisfying. Love it!

review/summary: Tully's French Roast K cups
review/text: I have had my Keurig coffee maker for over 2 years, in fact I replaced my original on its two year anniversary due to our water's mineral content but that is another story.  Over the past two years I have tried many of the different coffees.  My initial favorite was Donut Shop which tasted very much like Dunkin Donuts coffee.  I was diagnosed with high cholesterol in early 2011 so I started drinking my coffee black and I found the Donut shop K cups to be very bland.  I started trying a number of different K Cups and found Tully's French Roast.  This is now my favorite coffee, it is very dark and has an intense rich set of flavors.  I am not a professional taster so I won't try and describe the different flavors but suffice it to say it has a rich depth of flavors that I look forward to each morning.  It reminds me of a good red wine like a Cabernet, where there are a number of different subtle flavors that linger in your mouth long after you swallow.  I enjoy it, I hope you do as well.<br />Paul Speese<br />Regular Coffee Drinker

review/text: I only drink strong, bold coffee and this was strong but there was something slightly off about it.  Another reviewer said it had an almost bitter, fishy taste to it and that's the best description I could come up with also.  I expect some bitterness because of the type of coffee I like but the fishy, past it's prime taste was unexpected.  It wasn't the coffee maker because my daughter chose another flavor and it was spot on.  As I said in another review for this coffee...the sell by date was 15 more days out so maybe it was past its prime.

review/summary: Great Brew, just what a French Roast Should be.
review/text: Tully's French Roast is described by the maker as being intense and powerful with a bitter end. Traditionally a French Roast should be light smokey-burnt and maybe a little sweet with light to medium body with intense flavor. Tully's French Roast fulfills the above description very well. It's surprisingly smooth and balanced with no harsh or unexpected bitterness. Th Aroma wasn't as strong as I would expect, but did have burnt undertones which is a hallmark of a French Roast. However, the aroma isn't one that will catch your attention the way others will.<br /><br />Aroma: 3<br /><br />Sweetness: 3<br /><br />Acidity: 5<br /><br />Body: 4<br /><br />Bitterness: 5<br /><br />Aftertaste: 4<br /><br />Total: 90<br /><br />Scoring Summary:<br />(90-99) Very Awesome Coffee<br />(85-89) Very Good Coffee<br />(78-84) Just Average Coffee<br />(50-77) Just Poor Coffee

review/summary: Comparing Tully's and Green Mountain French Roast
review/text: In order to figure out which brand I should buy in the future I compared Tully's French Roast and Green Mountain French Roast k-cups side-by-side.  Results: Tully's has a more full bodied flavor, whereas Green Mountain has a thinner flavor (I can almost describe it as "more watery" but that wouldn't be the right word, but it is missing something).  I'm going to get Tully's from now on.  This k-cup tastes like a finely brewed French Roast with the full thickness and spectrum of texture and flavor.

review/text: Tully's french roast is a great bold cup of coffee with a slight bitter undertone. Bitter, used here by me, is meant in a good way, sort of the bitter undertone of semi-sweet chocolate instead of the light sweet tones of milk chocolate. It's a smooth but robust cup of coffee, a terrific way to kick start the morning.
