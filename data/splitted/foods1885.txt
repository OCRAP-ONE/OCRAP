review/summary: The best cookie for dark chocolate lovers
review/text: These are simply the best dark chocolate cookies I've ever tasted.  This is one product where the hype equals the reality.  Extremely intense dark chocolate flavor with high quality dark chocolate chunks.  Every month I buy Ghirardelli double chocolate cocoa and these cookies to satisfy my chocolate craving and both are so much better than the waxy, overly sweet, bland chocolate you find at a grocery store.  I discovered these when buying Christmas gifts for my mom who switched to gluten free, and I've been hooked ever since.  If you love intense dark chocolate, these are your cookies. Keep them in the fridge in the summer since they are so packed with chocolate that they'll melt otherwise.

review/text: These cookies are delicious and gluten-free. I bought them as a gift for my daughter who has Celiac disease. But I eat them, too, just because of the taste and texture! The sale price was great, and they are wrapped individually for convenience. Great for packing lunches or just a snack on the go!

review/summary: A 2-inch circle of chocolate perfection
review/text: I recently discovered I am gluten and dairy intolerant. Even before that, though, we were already buying these cookies at our local health food store. I have never been a cookie fan (yeah, crazy, right?) but these are perfect - there's no other way to put it. They are amazing either by themselves or dipped in coffee or dark red wine. The only difficulty is trying not to eat a whole box in a sitting, especially when my chocaholic husband is at home. We try to stick to the portion size listed in the box (2 cookies, 170 calories) just right enough to take care of the occasional sweet tooth.

review/text: These cookies are a chocolate lover's dream.  They do not taste like packaged cookies at all- and I can't even tell they are gluten free.  I will warn that you will think of these cookies all the time once you try them, so be careful when buying them in large quantities.  I have to hide these from my hubby and dole them out one package at a time every few days/day or so.  The two cookies per package makes these the perfect serving size to share, or not...

review/text: These babies are MUCH too good for my own good.  The chocolate chunks are large & made of very good chocolate, and the texture is chewy & firm.  To me, they actually taste just like a really good brownie mix-- as if somebody took unbaked brownie mix & turned it into a cookie.  I told myself I was going to try just one for dessert, & ended up eating the whole frigging box, only very reluctantly giving one to my friend.

review/text: If you like sweet and like chocolate, then you should like the taste of these. The main ingredient is sugar, so these are very sweet. They are also very crumbly, and only 9 cookies in each box, so they are expensive (and a box is only 5.29 oz). But because they are so tasty and 89% organic I'm giving them an overall 4 star rating.

review/summary: How can dark chocolate disappoint?
review/text: I was really disappointed with these cookies. I love anything dark chocolate, and the fact that they're organic was a big plus when I was contemplating the purchase.  However, some of the previous reviewers were right - they are over the top sweet (and I've never felt this way about any other cookies, especially dark chocolate ones). I've never tried gluten free cookies before, so maybe that's why they don't taste as good as I expected. Usually chocolate cookies go very fast at our house, but I still have most of the box sitting around.

Yes, it's more expensive then the stuff in the round cardboard, but how much salt do you really use?  We have replaced our old salt for this for all cooking purposes that call for fine salt. Really, it's that good!!!

review/summary: Not as healthy as plain raisin bran, but sure tastes good!
review/text: A quick glance at the nutrition panel will show that this has less fiber but more sugar than regular raisin bran. But, the taste makes it worth it - very crunchy, plump raisins, a real treat! My only criticism is that it is a bit too sweet. To balance the sweetness, I mix it with regular raisin bran (or other bran-heavy cereals). Makes for that comfortable middle ground.<br /><br />Great price when it goes on sale on Amazon. The regular price is far more than what you'd pay in a grocery store. I keep it in my cart and purchase only when the price dips way down.

review/summary: Sometimes, simple is best...
review/text: Raisin Bran is one of those cereals that, as a child, you are weary of.  You see your parents and your grandparents downing it because, well, they need to `fiber' and you think "that stuff tastes like cardboard" and so when they pour you a bowl you cringe a little.  In my adulthood I've become very fond of cereal and so I often peruse the cereal aisle at Walmart for different kinds to indulge in.  The other day, on a whim, I grabbed some Raisin Bran Crunch because I felt the urge to try it after all those years of fearing it so much.  This stuff is amazing.  It is a sweetened version of the original Raisin Bran, with plumper raisins and that crunch which gives the cereal texture that it needed (the soggy flakes that defined the original cereal are replaced by a firmer base).  Yes, Raisin Bran Crunch is a great part of my morning breakfast!

Best deal in terms of price. This Raisin Bran with crunch is the best in taste and one of the most healthily breakfast out there. I loved the original Raisin Bran and then this mix with the Crunch real gives it a kick. Just loved this cereal.

review/text: Yeah yeah I know it's high in sugar compared to all of those healthy cardboard tasting cereals, but it is so sweet and delicious AND filled with fiber. I was a fan of plain old raisin bran, but I find that those crunch little clusters really add another element. I've also tried the Raisin Bran Extra in the yellow box with the cranberries and other jazz and that was just a little too much excitement in the morning for me. You really can't go wrong with the price on Amazon and you'll have enough fiber to give you plenty of time to catch up on your reading in the bathroom during your morning break at work!

review/text: Last time I had this cereal was a decade ago. Liked it back then and like it now. In my opinion the regular Raisin Bran is a bit boring. This however, is not. It has plenty of taste. My only problem is that it's a bit sweet, as I believe some other review mentioned.

I typically buy the generic raisin bran cereal on wholesale and don't purchase the actual brand but the deal was cheaper so I picked this one. Man, it is yummy!

review/summary: Possibly the best cereal ever
review/text: I was never been a fan of Raisen Bran, and really had no intention of trying the Crunch version.  I was at a friends house, and that was all he had avialable, so I decided to give it a try.  Wow.  Keeps a crunch, nicely sweetened, and the raisens are a great counterpoint to the flakes.<br /><br />That was about a year ago.  Now RBC is my main breakfast cereal, with very little straying.  I turned my Dad onto it, and he is the same way.  We use the Amazon Subscribe and Save as it makes it about $2.50 a box vs. the $4.00 a box it is in the local grocery.  I have 4 boxes comes in about every 2 months, and have no issues going through it.

review/summary: raison bran crunch cereal
review/text: This is one of my favorite "healthy" cereals. It's high in protein and fiber and also fills me up for most of the morning. And, most importantly, it actually tastes good! It's also great in yogurt. My only complaint is that some of the clusters in the cereal are really large, so much so that I have to break them up before eating. A minor complaint, really. Overall, I highly recommend Raison Bran Crunch Creal!

review/text: Tasty, crunchy.. I like Rasin Bran Crunch .. it's not (in my opinion) too sweet as some reviewers seem to think BUT if you're looking for a cereal that tastes like regular Raisin Bran, this is not it. This is a similar cereal but with a slightly different taste experience. So, at the sale price ($7.29 for a 4 pk) it was a good buy but I still would prefer regular Raisin Bran to Raisin Bran Crunch.

review/text: Well this ceral sure does taste pretty good but it is as good for you as the regular (as someone else posted). I will say that this ceral is rather sugary tasting, so if your not in to the sweets, you may not want to buy it. As for me even regular kellogs rasin brand seems to have too much sugar and although it may sound strange, I think regular has too many rasins. I'm going to stick with post rasin brand!

review/summary: Great product; terrible price
review/text: I thought Raisin Bran Crunch was new when I first tried it, but it turns out someone had been keeping it a secret from me for a while. Though it's definitely not as healthy as the original, non-sugary-crunch incarnation, it's still probably better than eating marshmallows for breakfast? Not everyone will love it, especially if they've had and loved the original, but I always found it lacking a bit in flavor and added sugar and other bits to it myself.<br /><br />Enjoy it so much that I'd love to buy through Amazon, but that's not an option at this time, and the sellers are charging a pretty hefty price (I can get way cheaper even in the middle of New York City - that's saying something!).

review/summary: Pleasant Taste but Light on Raisins
review/text: I really love raisins and always keep a large box in the pantry; this probably explains my disappointment with Kellogg's Raisin Bran Crunch Cereal, it doesn't have enough raisins to suit me. I have found other brands of crunchy raisin bran cereal that have a lot more raisins. Kellogg's advantage is its wide availability; you can find it at most stores.<br /><br />The obvious solution is to add some raisins out of my raisin box to the cereal which is exactly what I do. I'm always a little disappointed when I have to do that.<br /><br />I have found the sweetness to be just right for me and enjoy the cereal right down to the bottom of the bowl. I also enjoy adding almonds to the cereal or even a banana. This is a favorite of my mine for supper and I enjoy it several times a week.

review/summary: Delicious cereal, horrible price
review/text: I love this cereal.  Essentially, if you like Raisin Bran but don't always love the fact that it surrenders to milk easily then this is your solution.  The honey in the granola clusters makes it especially great.<br /><br />What I have a problem with here is the price.  Amazon has this listed at $20.29 for 4 boxes.  That works out to just over $5 per box ($5.07 exactly).  Considering that I can go to Wal Mart and get the 25 oz. box for about $3.50 or even go to the one of the more expensive grocery stores in the area and pay $4.20 for these 18 oz. boxes, that seems like a horrible deal.  After all, you would hope that since you're buying in bulk here that you'd get some kind of discount.  Or at the very least I think it's reasonable to expect that you wouldn't be charged a premium for the privilege of buying 4 boxes at once.<br /><br />Delicious cereal, but not worth more than $5 per box as it is listed currently.

review/summary: Product of Mexico ???
review/text: Right on the box it says product of Mexico... nothing against any race or country but I prefer to have my food products made in the u.s.a .. This is basically raisin bran with some sweetened granola stuff added.. which could have been a nice twist to it.. EXCEPT .. it is WAY TOO SWEET . I finished the box but wont bother again.. This is a product I eat for both health reasons and enjoyment and this is a MAJOR FAIL . This much sugar turns it in just another sugar sweetened cereal..so common in america  these days it seems are unhealthy products disguised by bogus product labeling touting health benefits.To put this in perspective.. this cereal has 19 grams of sugar per cup.. Count Chocula has 15.6 grams per cup, so an unhealthy kids cereal has less sugar than this product. The #2 ingredient is... SUGAR !!! ... and if that wasnt enough.. there is also brown sugar, corn syrup and molasses added too. Forget about the 4 grams of fiber per cup.. with all that sugar its a " moot " point.I wouldnt be so hard on this product if the box wasn't plastered all over with how " wonderful and healthy " this makes your morning breakfast. This is a stupid amount of sugar. If your not a label reader than I advise you become one because "ignorance is not bliss " when it comes to the foods you eat and it seems there is no end to what companies will do to sabotage our health to make a buck. I'll look elsewhere .. Major Fail Kelloggs. I guess american plants and workers are no longer good enough for " all american " Kelloggs. Shame on you.

It is too sweet for breakfast, the only way to cut it is to add bran cereal, I do that with frosted flakes to cut the sugar.  Also the flakes seem to be a bit more "woody" than I remember.  I like the old one better.

review/text: I bought a 3 box pack of this cereal and really liked it at first. However, by the time I finished the third box I didn't find it it tasty anymore. I can't place my finger on it, but maybe it had something to do with the excessive sugars and other carbohydrates. I would get a 'sickly' feeling after consuming a bowl. I'm not much of a cereal eater in the first place, so maybe my body isn't used to this type of processed food.<br /><br />I certainly wouldn't dissuade anybody else from eating this stuff, but I don't think I'll be buying another box (or 3) anytime soon.

review/text: This cereal taste great, and I feel no one will be disappointed with the flavor or texture. Keep in mind that this item is even less healthy than normal Raisin Bran. Both are loaded with sugar, and actually light on the bran. This product has 80 calories of pure sugar. Combined that with the empty carbs of the processed rice and wheat with some milk and you are looking at around 200 empty calories. Should have just enjoyed a muffin, a cold coke or something else instead. It does however have some of the most fibrous part of a wheat grain, the bran, which most other gran products leave out. It also taste amazing if I haven't already mentioned. I will have this on occasion as sort of a desert for the day early in the morning, but would never consider making something like this part of a daily routine.

review/summary: High SUGARS !!!!!!
review/text: If I had review this by taste then I'd rate it a 4 star. From the nutrition facts I noticed that it has a considerable amount of sugars per serving which is like 20g. I'd rather prefer a different variety than this .

review/summary: Cereal boxes crushed
review/text: I ordered A case of dog food and these 4 boxes of cereal. I joined Amazon prime. 2 day free shipping. Awful packaging. Items got to me quickly that is about it. The cereal was wrapped in some kind of wrap and was crushed thanks to the Joes that packaged it. A simpleton knows that you don't put cereal in the same box as a case of dog food. Half of the boxes are mostly crumbs. Shop elsewhere for cereal

review/text: The price was great and the description seemed just what we like, Raisin Bran and more. But I found the cereal too sugary, and the killer: HFCS, which we try to avoid where possible. We used it up, but I won't be buying again.

review/summary: Too Sweet
review/text: I am surprised at all the positive reviews on here for such a sugary cereal. I remembered this cereal from my childhood and sought it out for a healthier alternative. My first bite, I couldn't believe how sweet it was. I looked at the box and was astounded. 20 grams of sugar per serving! That's more than kiddie sugary cereals! I now mix it with a cup of yogurt to cut the sweet taste...

review/summary: Mindblowingly Good
review/text: It wasn't until I bought a bag of these when I finally learned what good potato chips taste like. It's sort of like the epiphany you have when you think American cheese is the best cheese you've ever had until you actually try smoked gouda. I know that sounds like an overstatement, but that's how good Herr's Heinz-flavored ketchup chips are. Once you try these, all of your previous favorites will start to pale in comparison.<br /><br />"What's so darned great about them?" you are probably wondering. What's gotten everyone in such a tizzy? Why the rave reviews and the almost cult-like devotion to these chips? It's not just because they taste good. It's because Herr's is one of the few snack makers that bucks that shady practice so many of them engage in now, especially Pringles. You know what I mean-- that cute, little trick of advertising their chips as literally bursting with flavor, when in reality the chips are so lightly dusted that there's barely any flavor to them. Herr's philosophy in terms of chip-to-flavor ratio couldn't be more different. Open any one of their snacks-- especially this one-- and the chips are so covered in powder that it's impossible to not have it cake up on your finger tips without constantly cleaning them. These Heinz ketchup flavored chips are so heavily dusted, in fact, that you'll wind up with red-stained fingers for a few hours after gorging on them. It makes for a messy experience but in the end, getting a moutful of flavor with each bite makes the hassle of cleaning up all worthwhile!<br /><br />Sure, this excessive powder doesn't exactly make Herr's the healthiest of snack choices, but what snack is? It's all gonna kill us, anyway, so really-- all this really comes down to is choosing our poison. My poison happens to be these chips, and will most likely be yours once you taste them and subsequently become hopelessly addicted like me.

review/summary: Great flavor, Ketchup Chips
review/text: First time trying Herr's brand Ketchup potato chips, really love them. Its just as good as other brand catsup chips that I've tried in Canada. Glad these chips are available here in the U.S. and uses great flavoring with Heinz brand ketchup. Many think it may seem odd to have ketchup on chips, its similar to eating normally fries and ketchup. It doesn't have that strong of a overwhelming ketchup flavor on the chips, which is great, reason many of my friends like them<br /><br />If really want a stronger ketchup flavored taste, I personally recommend get a bottle of Heinz ketchup and dip your ketchup flavored chips into some actual ketchup, like you would with fries.

review/summary: what a flavor!
review/text: When these Herr's ketchup-flavored chips first hit the market, I remember I was taking some assembly in high school and a worker from Herr's was trying to convince the class to take a free bag of chips.  Everyone was either disinterested or disgusted by the thought of ketchup chips, and I regret following suit and leaving with the classmates while ignoring the free miniature bag samples in the box.  I strongly regret it in fact.  These chips are *awesome!*  I highly recommend them.  Don't just ignore them because the thought of ketchup on a potato chip sounds unappealing- they're actually really good.

review/summary: Good, but pricey.
review/text: The product is amazingly addictive, but the price quoted here is way beyond bad.  At my local Save-A-Lot, I can buy a 3.75 ounce bag for $1.00, no tax.  If this is 42 1-ounce bags, then that would total 11.2 regular bags, or $11.20 ($12 rounded to a full bag).  The official site is just as bad wanting to sell a box of 15 normal bags for $25 before shipping.<br /><br />My local store is running out, but I don't want to be paying this much for wholesale.

review/text: I'm not familiar with this band. I picked up Herr's BBQ chips at a snack stand in a medical plaza. They were tastier that I thought they would be. Crispy, sweet, and salty. However, I still prefer Lays BBQ chips as my number one choice though.  I paid only 99 cents for a one ounce bag. Worth it.

review/summary: Ketchup chips are great, but these aren't them
review/text: There is currently a problem with this item entry in Amazon.  The description that comes up in a search, before you get to this page, is "Herr's Potato Chips, Heinz Ketchup Flavored, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 42)."<br /><br />I ordered this and got a 42-bag variety pack of various other chips like BBQ and regular, not any ketchup-flavored ones.  Upon closer examination, the description that is on this page just lists "Herr's Potato Chips," in contrast to the other description.<br /><br />I was able to return the item, but was informed that there are no Herr's Ketchup-Flavored Chips available.  (And I really don't get that.  If the ketchup-flavored chips are so popular and in such demand, you'd think that Herr's would do something about ramping up their production accordingly, and maybe ramping down some of the other flavors, because these chips are pretty much NEVER available.  But apparently I'm talking crazy talk.)<br /><br />Oh well.

review/summary: Addictive
review/text: A couple of years ago, my Wal-Mart carried large bags of these for a short time and I was instantly hooked but when they stopped, I couldn't get them without ordering directly from Herr's site which was a bit of a hassle. Now that I can get them from Amazon, feeding my addiction is easier and more convenient.<br /><br />Although I generally like BBQ and spicy foods, most BBQ flavored chips and jalepeno/salsa/hot flavored chips taste somewhat bland and very artificial to me. It's not that I can't taste the flavors; it's just that they don't seem to resemble the actual taste of BBQ or peppers or salsa, etc. But with these chips, it really tastes like eating crisp french fries smothered in ketchup, and licking my bright red fingertips clean is half the fun!<br /><br />Packaging was a little excessive. Looks like Herr's ships their standard store-delivery box (already well padded) to Amazon which puts the entire Herr's box into an Amazon box for shipment to you. Net result is that you get a huge box with a whole lot of tape, plastic, and cardboard between you and the chips.

review/text: I  gave this a try just to get Amazon's prime shipping when I  was trying to fill up a order. I  must admit that I'm glad I brought these even though when you add up the weight of each bag and price you can get about six big bags at Walmart , had just reorder some more because  I like the individual bags they was fresh and not smashed up in the box. Will probably order some more later.If up to me they should have equal amount of each variety will be worth it.

review/text: Honestly, was expecting more. Although, how else would one feel if something new and never-before-seen came to sight? Well, I sure expected greatness. Eventhough, I'm no fan of ketchup, but I am a fan of chips. Ketchup is old-school and out-dated. Away with ketchup! (not really) So anyways, turns out, these chips had great taste to it. Has more tomatoe taste than I think it should have. Nevertheless, experience the crisp crunchiness of potatoe chips, in the flavor of french-fries dipped in ketchup! Perpare your face for a smile! (sound like i need to get payed for this; agree?)
