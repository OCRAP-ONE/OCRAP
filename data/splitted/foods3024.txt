review/text: AWESOME BREAD ! ! !<br />Also is awesome that I can purchase the mix from Amazon. It is so convenient to just order a case of 6. Our local Raley's store has a good "gluten free" section but this particular mix is often not in stock. Thank you Amazon.

review/summary: This is worth trying
review/text: This product is a lifesaver!  Many gluten free product are of poor taste and texture....this product is not.  My child is gluten free and we use this mix mostly to make pizza crust but also rolls and occasionally a loaf of bread.  It is better than most other products we have tried and we have tried a lot!  I usually make a batch of individual-size pizza crusts and keep them in the freezer for easy use.

review/summary: Good pizza crust, works without eggs
review/text: I can't use eggs, so I had to use egg substitute, and it worked quite well.  The dough was "knead-able", though I may have used less liquid than you would with eggs.  For pizza crust I used olive oil for the butter/oil, and a bit extra salt.  It makes a decent loaf of bread as well... it is denser than gluten bread but great when fresh from the oven.  The color is much whiter than the gluten counterparts (with no eggs used), but the flavor and texture are good.

review/summary: Best  gluten-free bread ever!
review/text: I wanted to make a french bread apple bake. I made it in my pre-gf days and have missed it terribly. Not anymore! This mix was easy to follow with few ingredients to add to the mix. I made mine in a regular bread pan and baked it in the oven. Made 2 loaves because I thought I would need that much for the Apple Bake. Did not need both so froze the other. This bread was golden and crisp on the outside and soft and chewy inside! It is the best gf bread I have found in the past 20 yrs! I have tried other brands that baked up ok but had an after taste (it might be the bean flour) or was like a brick.  THANKS SO MUCH TO GLUTEN FREE PANTRY FOR A WONDERFUL BREAD MIX!

review/summary: Gluten Free French Bread
review/text: This bread is very good for gluten free bread.  I used it in my turkey stuffing, and it received excellent comments from those who had also eaten the same dressing made with gluten sourdough bread.  The only negative (which I think is true of virtually all gluten free breads) is that it is a little on the crumbly side.  This bread was actually better than most in that regard, however.

review/text: My 8-yr old son loves this bread. He can't have wheat or dairy, so finding a bread for him is not easy. I've tried several different mixes and recipes, and this one has worked the best for us. It turns out every time, it doesn't break the bank, it freezes well, and, most importantly, the texture and flavor are as close to "real" bread as we've found. We make a loaf, slice it right away, and store it in the freezer, 2 slices per ziploc bag, so we can get out just a slice or two at a time. It's great.

review/text: About once a week I make two long 2-1/2" wide by about 15" long bread "pans" out of foil and spray with Pam.  I spoon the dough into them, smooth it with wet hands and let rise until it's doubled, then bake for about 25 minutes.  This makes two nice sized baguettes. If I'm in a hurry, I'll just make it in the breadmaker.  The kids like for me to make soft baked pretzels with this, and you can find the recipe (and many more) on the gluten free pantry website.

review/text: I've been dying to have pizza again since I recently went gluten free, so I picked this up at a local store to give it a shot.<br />Wow, was it amazing!! This mix made the heaviest deep dish pizza I've ever seen! I haven't even been able to make a pizza crust like this with regular flour. We loaded the dough with cheese, sauce, and pepperoni, and we're still trying to finish the pizza, days later. It doesn't take exactly like "regular" pizza crust, but I almost can't remember the taste of "regular" pizza crust after eating this, it was so good!<br /><br />Thank you, Gluten-Free Pantry, for giving us such a great pizza crust!

review/text: Ok, so we are brand new to the gluten free lifestyle and this is actually the first attempt at bread that I have made. I mixed the dough up as instructed and realized that french bread is not shaped like a brick, so I attempted to make it at least look like a loaf of bread. Umm.. that didn't work out, this stuff had the texture of frosting. I ended up making rolls. As for flavor, I kept thinking something was missing (ie; flavor of any kind), even homemade jam only helped a little. Great texture and moisture levels though.

review/summary: This is bread?
review/text: I have made this bread 3 times now and feel that I can, finally, write a review.  This mix is certainly not as advertised.  The first time I thought it was me...that I had done something incorrectly.  But after 2 more baking sessions, I know it is not me.  I made it in a bread machine....one that I had used for non-wheat free bread mixes.  I followed directions to the letter.  The regular breads were great...so it's not me or the machine.  This "bread" is really dense and very, very dry.  I cannot eat it without sloshing down plenty of liquids.  It's like eating baked cardboard.  I went to their website to see if I could get some recipes for this mix (other than "french bread" and "pizza crust") and came up with nothing.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this product.  I have been using Pamela's baking mixes for a long time....not the bread mix...but this does not compare favorably with Pamela's products.  Even their products are a little dense and dry, needing some serious cups of tea to get down.  So far, I do not find that the gluten free mixes are that great.  The one exception might be a brownie mix I got at Trader Joe's.

review/text: That word sums it up, but I'll add two more:  bland and bricklike. The nicest thing I can say about this bread is that it has a decent crust when it first comes out of the oven.  But seriously, people -- this is not even remotely like true French bread.  It's heavy and virtually flavorless.  You can do much better.  Then again, I have yet to enjoy a gluten-free bread that comes from a mix.  I find it nearly as easy and far more satisfying to make my own.

review/text: I looked forward to trying this for pizza crust, as it advertises.  First of all, the directions for preparation use WAY too much liquid.  Even by cutting the liquid down, I could never get my dough to look like anything other than paste.  I'd end up adding a bunch of gluten-free flours to get it to doughy consistency for pizza (or so it, at least, wouldn't stick to my fingers and not the pan.)  It had NO flavor either.  Disgusting pizza crust.  And so I tried it for bread and I couldn't even get my kids to eat it when I disguised it with garlic and cheese and butter.  (Kind of defeats the purpose of eating healthy, doesn't it?)  I would never buy this product again.

review/summary: Great food and awesome price
review/text: As an owner of a young American Mastiff pup, we had to switch to this due to some protein concerns. The more popular brands like Blue Buffalo and other brands are actually 25% higher in protein. The Holistic Select in my area can only be found in two specialty stores. Not only are they out of my way, they are about a buck higher in cost. I was hesitant about ordering from Amazon at first being a food product. I can assure you the service is outstanding. Each bag has always come inside a box and the food was protected. The shelf-life remaining on the food has always been greater than six months remaining. Plus, I save the gas money having to go get as it is left at my front door. I hope Amazon keeps this in their inventory and would be neat to see it added to their auto delivery program. Giant Breed dogs tend to do better on lamb based lower protein foods. If you are on the fence about Amazon handling this, let me reassure you that you will not find better pricing and consider the service of delivery to your door!!!

Now that he is older he is on a higher protein diet that is not suitable for the new pup. Most of the large breed specific puppy foods I've food contain higher levels of protein and calcium that are not suitable for giant breed pups, and with my older one I did a lot of research and had him on adult diets from the start. The breeder of the new pup recommended this line and after researching the product I started our new pup on this. They have done extremely well on this diet and I am pleased with the high quality ingredients used in this product.

Our 13 week puppy lost ten pounds and spent time in the vet hospital, just to get her digestive system back on. We will not be buying this anymore. We know for certain that it was the food.

review/text: There isn't too much one can say about this, other than it is great and a constant companion in my kitchen. It is basically minced garlic in a tube, and that's about it.  The consistency and flavor is roughly identical to garlic that has been through a garlic press.<br /><br />However, anyone who does a lot of cooking with garlic knows what a pain it is to peel and crush the stinking rose, and just grabbing this little tube saves you a lot of time and energy.  It substitutes just fine for any recipe requiring minced or crushed garlic.  Obviously, if you want big chunks then you still have to do it the old fashioned way, but this is one of those short cuts that actually work. In fact, it works so good it is surprising that this is an imported Japanese product, and not a regular US food item found in any grocery store.

review/summary: Very good brand of macaroni.
review/text: This is the first time ordering Anna's pasta products.<br /><br />It's made in Italy.  It's pure Semolina.  This shape is wonderful.  It's close to a pappardelle, not quite as wide, with wavy edges, a lot less money, too.  I love the shape.  It's substantial with a meaty Bolognase.  It does make it fun to eat as you use your fork to try to get the long, wide noodle into your mouth...it's not slurp-able.<br /><br />I used the Fasta Pasta maker, cooked for about 14 minutes on high.  This is a one pound package so I used half for just a few of us. We all really liked this shape and this brand.  I will order this shape again.

review/summary: Vanilla-great, chocolate too sweet for me
review/text: Vanilla - Tastes great over cereal or in your coffee.  I mix it a bit thicker than the directions for cereal, and put it directly into strong coffee, sometimes with some chocolate for a rich mocha.  Tried the chocolate, but it was too sweet for me.<br /><br />I was tired of soy milk turning into really soft tofu when I didn't finish the carton soon enough.  Since I'm the only one who drinks soy milk, it's hard to get through even a liter quick enough.  Better Than Milk lets me mix what I just what I need for a couple days.

review/summary: Simply Amazing!
review/text: I bought this kit because I am a college student and a Pre-Med Biology Major, and needed to do a multidisciplinary project on bacteria plus I had been very interested in cheese making before, but never had a real excuse to get into it. Let me tell you, this kit is AMAZING! Essentially this kit comes with everything but the stock pot, and while you are on amazon you can pick up one of these for rather cheap also!<br /><br />This kit includes everything you will need to begin your journey into cheese making, it also provides a book that will not only guide you through the process of cheese making, but will also, help you to learn new and exciting recipes. I recommend doing some basic home cheese making research before you buy this kit so you can get the other things you will need to start (Basically just the pot and a few other small inexpensive items).<br /><br />Other wise, I love this product and am considering buying them for others in my family who want to start cheese making after my example! This is a great product I highly recommend it!

review/summary: This product does not exist.
review/text: I am writing this to inform you, and save you the headache. Like the others, I saw this 25-pack of snozzles at a price too good to be true, and naively purchased them immediately for my dogs. They were listed and sold by PetCo. When they came, I got one huge box, containing a lot of stuffing paper, and a single tiny snozzle....joke was on me it seems.<br /><br />After this, PetCo emailed me a generic message saying there was a discrepancy with the item listing, and they sent me the wrong amount. I emailed PetCo and never received a response. I checked their seller profile, and found a gigantic archive of negative seller ratings, many of them specifically related to the same issue I was experiencing. I then emailed them a few more times. I'm not surprised they never answered a single one of them. Probably too backed up with hundreds of other emails like mine.<br /><br />I never did get my other 24 snozzles, although they refunded me, probably because I kept emailing them. I gave my dog the single snozzle we got, and they did not even want it. I examined it, and it has a chemical smell to it, and looks old. It is quite unfair how someone does this, and can just get away with it, and one does not even get a personal apology.<br /><br />I have decided to join a few others in going to the Better Business Bureau about this. Hope you decide to join in too.

review/summary: Merrick Snozzles are the Schiz-nit!
review/text: We initially purchased some Merrick Snozzles at our local pet superstore at the recommendation of one of their personnel who said they were better for puppies than the rawhide chews. Rawhide used to really tear up our last dog's stomach, so we didn't feed them to him for long. Our Airedale Terrier loves them. Now that he's a year old, one will only last him about 20 minutes vs. lasting a couple of days when he was younger, but they have never upset his stomach. Buying them in bulk on Amazon is also a lot cheaper than buying them individually at the pet store.

review/text: Bought this to replace Prescription Diet Feline K/D that my one of my cats had to eat after a renal dysfunction diagnosis. He  ate it  but din't particularly loved it. He clearly prefers Royal Canin over PD. Maybe it's the softer texture (not much teeth left, bad dentition case). Even the other cats prefer this food to theirs (so I guess the taste is better too). I have to supervise the meal times now. And about the efficiency of the food (mixed with K/D caned food and renal powder): my 14 year old big lazy cat is like almost a kitty again. He runs all around, he regain his personality, he plays and purrs all the time.

review/text: This seems much less chemically, and is fresher tasting, than other canned or foil-pouch packed poultry products I've tried.<br /><br />I'm old enough to remember when cans were packed full of the actual product on the label, so it's really annoying that most cans I buy now are about half full of product, with the rest of the can being filled with liquid.<br /><br />However, these cans are much fuller than other brands I've tried.  The liquid is broth, and it seems to keep the chicken meat flavorful and in good condition.  The chunks are of a generally nice, useful size.  The meat doesn't tend to disintegrate or mush, like other canned chicken brands I've tried.  The meat also was not stringy, dry or of a bad texture.  It really was a very noticeable improvement over the other brands.<br /><br />I will keep this product on hand as a staple in my pantry.

review/summary: A good sweetener for many things
review/text: I like Diabetisweet for many reasons.<br />First of all, it's not the same as the others, it's not aspartame, or saccharine or sucrolose, so I can have additional options for sweetening.<br /><br />Another thing I discovered by mistake is that Diabetisweet browns better than other sweeteners. Because it has some calories/sugar it can actually turn brown and become crunchy.  I baked a cheesecake and while we  prefer they not brown I was surprised to see it did.  I use it to make faux cinnabuns by melting butter in a skillet, then sprinkling a Tablespoon of Diabetisweet and a layer of cinnamon powder, and waiting till it bubbles then I place some bread down in the pan and swirl it about wiping up the syrup onto the surface and let it cool. it tastes like the top of cinnamon buns.<br /><br />It has a nice "sugar granule" texture to it for when you want that. I use it as part of a sweetener blend of 1/3 splenda, and 2T each Diabetisweet, Xylitol and Erythritol to equal one cup of sugar.<br /><br />Lastly, the price for this product beats the walmart price to death with a big stick. I was paying almost $10 per box and often had to special order it cause it is not a regular shelf item.  Now I have found a great price and with the subscription service I will never run out again unless I want to.<br /><br />ETA March 10, 2011<br />I've found It also makes a good faux caramel for caramel popcorn.  if you take a quarter cup of it and a couple capfuls of caramel Sugar Free syrup for flavor, and heat it in a small non-stick skillet/sauce pan, till it bubbles and turns tan, then add a tablespoon of butter and stir it in, then drizzle it over a serving (one personal sized bag) of cooked popcorn, it's lighter in flavor but makes a great lower sugar caramel corn treat.  It could be a great treat for someone who doesn't want to diet but still wants less sugar and it's fun and easy.<br /><br />ETA January 16, 2012<br />While my previous review still stand, I have noted that the price of this subscribe and ship item has been climbing rapidly. Fairly soon it will not be a good of a deal as other sellers except for the free shipping.  Right now it is only 30-40 cheaper per box than buying it singly.

Place in a water bath and bake until set around the edges, but still loose in the center, about 50 to 60 minutes. Remove from oven and leave in the water bath until cooled. Remove cups from water bath and chill for at least 2 hours, or up to 2 days. When ready to serve, sprinkle about 2 teaspoons of sugar over each custard. For best results, use a small, hand-held torch to melt sugar. If you don't have a torch, place under the broiler until sugar melts. Re-chill custards for a few minutes before serving.

review/text: It claims to be great for baking and it is--and it is the only sugar substitute that I have found that absolutely performs as well as sugar.  I like to bake various breads and  sugar imparts a quality essential to those loaves that call for it and so does this.  Hallelujah!  And a Huzzah too!  Oh, and as to cooking--same great results.

review/summary: Not good for cooking at all
review/text: Prepared 2 cookie recipes - one with DiabetiSweet and one with Splenda.  DiabetiSweet basically melted all over the cookie sheet while the cookies made with Splenda kept their shape.  Not good.<br />Next I actually ate the cookies.  The DiabetiSweet cause severe cramps and multiple bathroom trips.  Splenda had no effect.<br />What's alarming is there is no warning on the package.  If you purchase items made with malitol you get a warning.  Isomalt must be malitol.  I'd look it up, but why bother.  I'm done with DiabetiSweet and if I can warn someone else away from this horrid product then so much the better.

review/text: When my brother was diagnosed with diabetes, my wife asked me to cut back on my sugar intake.  I agreed as long as she could find something that tasted like sugar.  After trying about a dozen substitutes that I couldn't stand, she found DiabetiSweet.  It's expensive compared to most, but it's so worth it!  I can enjoy it in coffee or tea, and I've used it in every recipe where I would use sugar.  It tastes more like sugar than any other sub I've tried.  And my wife is happy from the health standpoint.

I heard that the other artificial sweeteners mess with your kidney eventually, and this product does not.  There is no aftertaste and it improves the taste of coffee.  I drink it also, and prefer it to sugar.

This can be a hassel when we all get together.<br /><br />Last year I decided to find a brand of syrups that had enough flavor options and the quality I belive my family deserves.<br /><br />Amoretti Delivers. I have gone through several brands of syrups in different flavors to find the one I liked the best. Thier customer service is also wonderful to deal with. I have placed several very large orders with them and on ocassion I find a special surprize in with the order which is nice.<br /><br />As for this particular flavor it is my boyfriend and mother's favorite. I bought my parents a bottle for Christmas that is now empty and now I am back to buy 2 bottles because I need one at my house now too.

Since I wanted to stop wasting my money at those certain coffee shops, I "opened" my own shop in my house.  I asked her what flavored coffee syrups she would like and of course, Blueberry was her pick.  This is a true blueberry flavor without the artificial taste.  It is thick, sweet and a little goes a long way.  In my opinion, Amoretti makes the BEST syrups money can buy!

I'm keeping it since I still like the taffy (and so does my husband) but it's not what I wanted.

review/text: I LOVE Morton's seasoning, have not found any product blend that comes close.  My only caveat is the sodium content.  The bottle is about 70% salt and blended herbs and spices make up the difference.  If salt isn't a problem in your diet, enjoy!  If so, you may want to consider their lower sodium version (personally, I have yet to try it).<br /><br />I use my Showtime Rotisserie at least once a week and Morton's Seasoning Blend is the BEST product I have ever used in prepping my chickens or cornish game hens.

review/summary: Great for Home-Made Chicken Nuggets
review/text: My family used this seasoning in chicken nuggets when I was a child, and now I use it. Delicious! Whenever I make it for friends, they ask for the recipe. It's simple:<br />-4-6 chicken breasts (thaw if frozen)<br />-2 cups flour<br />-4 tablespoons Nature's Seasons, or to taste (my mom uses 1 T per cup of flour)<br />-oil to fill your fryer appropriately<br />-milk (4 cups?)<br /><br />Cut up the chicken breasts to make nuggets. An inch wide and two inches long is about right, but you don't need to be exact. Put the chicken in a bowl and fill it with milk (until just covering the chicken). Let it sit in the refrigerator until you're ready to cook it. In another bowl, mix the flour and seasoning together. Heat the oil to 340 degrees. Coat each piece of chicken in the flour mixture and fry two minutes and forty-five seconds or until light golden in color. They will darken a bit after they are out of the oil.<br /><br />Mmmm. It's good with Paula Deen's corn casserole.

review/summary: Dissapointed
review/text: I have bought hot pepper oil in Italy and brought it home. That oil had great flavor as well as heat and was ridiculously expensive (about 3 euros for 1oz). This oil unfortunately has very little flavor and is mostly heat. Furthermore it does not taste fresh at all. It has that stale, old, olive oil taste. Possible that it was not stored properly It also has a bit of a chemical taste as well that I think is coming from the rubber seal on the stopper.<br /><br />I will not be using the oil on pizzas or other food because the staleness of the flavor will be too pronounced. I plan on mostly using this to mix with dipping spices and balsamic to dip bread with as that will mask the stale flavor. All in all, It's not awful but I'm pretty disappointed because I had high hopes for it.

review/text: We fell in love with the spicy pizza oil they used to serve at Buca de Beppo's but it was eventually pulled when the bean counters took over (and they removed the spicy pizza itself). This oil is very similar. The only thing I didn't care for is the bottle design because it is impossible to pour without it getting some product on the outside of the bottle, leaving a sticky mess. I would prefer a bigger, plain bottle. But the oil is yummy!

review/summary: Great food for bullies, the the large bag is problematic
review/text: As any bully owner knows, Royal Canin is best because the shape of the kibble is designed for a bulldog.  With other foods, bulldogs can eat in such a way that the food can aspirate in their lungs, cause pneumonia, and even be fatal.  The wave shape and the size of the kibble from Royal Canin's Bulldog formula works with the design of the bulldog's mouth and palate to reduce this risk.<br />We also noticed a drastic reduction in the farting.  Again, every bully owner knows that this is a serious plus!  :)<br />Our English boy (slightly over a year old now) has been eating it for months (after we tried SO many foods) and this is the only one that reduces the farting, is safe for him to eat, and hasn't caused allergies.  If your bully has a food allergy, the poor thing can be miserable - skin rash, hair falling out, lots of discharge from the eyes, cysts and skin infections, upset tummy, loose stool, etc.  We had none of those problems with this blend.<br />Originally, we bought the smaller bags because they are resealable, but we did the math and it was more economical to simply buy the large bag. (We have Amazon Prime, so shipping cost wasn't an issue).  The large bag isn't resealable though, and it can get tossed about and torn a bit during shipping.  I would recommend buying a large rubbermaid (or whatever brand) container so you can dump this large bag's contents into the container, seal it up, and then toss the bag.  That way, you won't have to worry about bugs or the food getting gross.

review/text: Amazon's subscription service for Irn-Bru is near magical as it actually makes it affordable to regularly enjoy this delicious taste of Scotland.  If it wasn't for the retarded FDA rejection of one of the dyes used in the UK product, I would be drinking the sugar free version, but as the regular Irn-Bru is made with cane sugar instead of corn syrup, I can justify allowing myself one every day or two.<br /><br />The free shipping on the service is what seals the deal.  This makes it less than buying in bulk from Barr's US distributer as you end up spending more in shipping with them than you do on the actual soda.  I no longer have to wait for Scottish Festivals or pay the markup that the British import shops levy on this yummy elixir!<br /><br />For those looking for a taste of the homeland, this is the ONLY way to go!<br /><br />ENJOY!

review/summary: I LOVE IRN BRU!!!
review/text: IRN BRU is, in my opinion, the best thing since sliced bread. I lived in Scotland for a while and for the past 11 years I have been searching for it wherever I go. Actually I have been ordering it online for quite sometime but the AMAZON shipping makes it much much more affordable. Now... if AMAZON could start carrying the sugar-free or diet IRN BRU I would go through a 12 pack+ per week. I love IRN BRU!!!! :)

review/summary: Best soda on planet - and made with girders!
review/text: When I was in Scotland a few years past I fell in love with this soda, and when I saw that it was available on Amazon I stocked up. Thank you Amazon for carrying this excellent product - it is half the sugar (real sugar as mentioned by other reviewers) and has a very complex palate taste which can be found nowhere else. And, as the Scots would always say, "It's made with GIRDERS"

review/summary: SO excited my hair almost fell out!
review/text: I just got my Irn Bru! It doesn't taste like orange at all, it tastes like bubble gum. It's good and my kids love it! It needs to be really cold to enjoy it. Defiantly not Pepsi or Coke like we are used to here in the States. But, it could taste like fresh cut grass juice and we would still love it because it is from SCOTLAND!!! Alba an Aigh!

review/text: So happy to be able to find this here - being a Scot who now lives on "the other side of the pond", I have missed my other "national drink".  Can't wait for the next shipment to arrive!

review/summary: An interesting, unique flavor.
review/text: I recently decided that I wanted to try different sodas that were less common or from around the world. After seeing Irn-Bru on a few occasions, I decided to try it first. It definitely helps too that it isn't outrageously expensive like some are on here.<br /><br />Anyway, I received it this past Friday while at work, so when I got home, it was sitting there, still warm. I was so excited to try it that I went ahead and drank one warm.<br /><br />DO NOT do this. Not because it's bad per se, but it is much, much, MUCH better cold.<br /><br />As far as the flavor goes, it's hard to describe. The label says it is citrus...yeah, so it Sprite. Citrus is as generic a term for soda as "rock" is for music. But the best way I think I can describe it is it is like a mix between citrus (a mix of orange, lime, and lemon) cream and bubble gum.<br /><br />One thing I also noticed, aside from the fact that it is extremely sweet, it is a very heavy drink. Whenever I would drink it, it would make me feel full pretty quickly.<br /><br />Overall, I definitely would have it again, but only as an occasional thing. I do recommend trying it if you're looking for something different.

review/summary: Taste of Caledonia
review/text: People argue about what Irn-Bru tastes like...I am just thankful that it has caffiene in it and when I am sipping it I can at least imagine that my dreams to fly to Glasgow have come true.
