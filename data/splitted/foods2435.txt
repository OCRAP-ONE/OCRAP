review/summary: This is the one gluten free product I use the most
review/text: I use this product all the time. It's wonderful! I use the bisquik impossible pie recipes and just replace this for bisquik, the french apple pie recipe is my favorite, the impossile taco pie is a easy dinner and nobody can tell the difference. I,ve also used it to make muffins and cookies the pancakes are'nt bad either.Being on a gluten free diet can be costly and boring,but this one product has made it so much more bearable.

review/summary: Tasty (when cooked) mix.
review/text: Recently my husband and I decided to live Gluten-free for health reasons. The mix is a bit expensive considering how much a bag of flour costs, but I'm surprisingly happy with the results so far. Chocolate cookies are great with this. We can't even tell the difference. Just don't eat the batter.

review/text: I really like the sandwich bread mix and the chocolate cake mix made by Bob's Red Mill so I was really excited to try making biscuits. Unfortunately, this mix is really salty and did not rise well. Could not even swallow the first bite. Maybe, I did something wrong but it was so bad that I haven't had the urge to try it again.

review/summary: Good Substitute for Principe Biscuits
review/text: I have been desperately searching for Principe Biscuits ever since my parents brought some back from their trip to Spain. However, it does not seem to be a product that is imported to the U.S. The only ones I could find to buy were from a British online store and it cost more to ship them than to purchase the cookies themselves! I just couldn't justify spending $100 on cookies, so I tried to forget about them. Until, one day I came across these Hit Biscuits at the grocery store. They looked similar, so I thought that I would give them a shot. I'm so glad I did. These are suckers are great, especially dipped in milk! They are almost the exact same thing as the Principe Biscuits, although, the cookie parts of Principe Biscuits are slightly less dense and a tiny bit flakier than the Hit Biscuits. So the Principe Cookies are still #1, but Hit Biscuits are a very close 2nd and are great if you can't get a hold of any Principes.

review/text: I was wandering by the cookies and crackers section in my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and spotted this small package (5.3 ounces) of Bahlsen Hit chocolate-filled cookies. They're imported from Germany and I've had other products made by Bahlsen that were quite good. These cookies are excellent. The biscuit part is nice and fresh. The chocolate creme center part is dark and tasty. They go real well with coffee, I might add. Probably tea too. Enjoy!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Love them!
review/text: I used to eat these noodles in high school in the UK and absolutely loved them. The girls from Hong Kong sold them. Yes, they are big in Hong Kong, but the maker themselves, Nissin is Japanese.<br /><br />Other reviewers are right, it is a knock off of the famous Ramen noodles. However, for me, these noodles taste differently than Ramen.<br /><br />When I buy Ramen in the US, I absolutely do not like it. These ones, I do like. To me it is an alternative and better version of Ramen. The only complaint I have is that the soup base powder is slightly too salty. But that can be fixed by reducing the quantity added.<br /><br />To add that spice, it goes well with Chinese chilli oil

review/summary: Inferior quality made in Hong Kong
review/text: I ordered these based upon the claim that these were imported from Japan. False! This product is licensed to be produced in Hong Kong and sold in cheaper markets, including the US. It would never be imported into Japan and therefore, never exported from there.<br /><br />How do they taste? If these were supposed to be Pringles, they taste as if they were called Prangels. They are close but not as good and disappointingly less satisfying than expected from the original.<br /><br />Food is only as good as it's ingredients. Local resources goes into producing this ramen in Hong Kong and differ in taste and quality from the original. If this cheaper version was identical to the Japan produced Nissin noodles, the version sold in Japan would be imported from Hong Kong instead of being still made in Japan. People in Japan will know the difference and are wary of the quality, as am I.<br /><br />A Mercedes Benz made in Germany is different in quality from one made in another country. I expect honesty in the origin of a product. These noodles are misrepresented. While the noodles are edible, the untruth is unforgivable. If you want the Hong Kong version, then you can enjoy the noodles sold here but I could buy the HK version locally for much less. I'm willing to pay more for real Japanese ramen but, not this.<br /><br />I know I can return this ramen but, that would not change how I feel and someone else will be fooled so, this review would remain the same. I want real instant Nissin Demae Iccho ramen that is made in Japan. This is not it.

However, though the flavor is good, it is much weaker than the others.  There are shipping charges with the Yama and Kirtland teas, but I'll probably stick with them in the future (esp. the Yama brand for it's pricing and paper bags, as opposed to Kirtland's nylon bags).

review/summary: Better left indoors, but overall a great plant!
review/text: I received my plant promptly and when I did it was already covered in buds so I knew it was going to be a pretty bloom! My buds opened up into beautiful jasmine flowers within a week and a half, and if it wasn't for the Texas heat they wouldn't have shriveled up and fell off the plant. That being said, if you live in a very hot or a very cold climate, keep this inside by a sunny window and there it will thrive. Mine sure looks great on my desk at the office :) *But if you keep in in the air conditioning, remember to put a tray of water under it to keep the air around the plant humid! Otherwise it may dry out and start to look poor.* I remember reading somewhere to keep these plants in temperatures ranging from 70-90 degrees, so that may be some good guidelines on whether you put the plant indoors or outdoors. The only complaint I have with the actual seller is that they shipped the plant wrapped in plastic. My plant was not damaged or suffocated when I received it, but that still just seems odd to me...

review/text: I've had this plant for about eight months now. I ordered it in the middle of winter, when I was, strangely enough, just getting into plants. Plants fill my windowsills now, but this bonsai was one of my very first plants.<br /><br />It came very carefully packed with packing peanuts, if I recall correctly, and it had dark green, glossy leaves and a beautiful pot; shipping did not appear to have impacted it at all, and it came with a sheet of paper instructing me how to care for it. (This can also be found on the bonsaiboy website.) It didn't grow in the winter, obviously, but when spring and summer rolled around this year, I saw two bursts of growth and a single flower. The single flower is my fault; because I love this bonsai so much, I'm too afraid to put it outside!<br /><br />It's one of my hardiest plants, and has never given me any trouble but a bout with spider mites that I understand is probably due to my not washing the leaves often enough. The only plant I have more trouble free is probably my phal!

A very nice lady at Amazon apologized and promised to send me what I'd actually ordered. Within two days, another box arrived, and I had received 6 more jars of Saucy Mamma onions. Now let me just say that they are equally delicious. Briny, not overly salty, crisp, and quite a perky addition to a gin beverage. It didn't seem worth complaining again because I could easily and happily live with the mistake. But I never did get those Tanquerey onions. Alas.

review/summary: Best peanut butter replacement.
review/text: I tried the unsweetened soybutter about 3 years ago.  I gagged!  Then a year after that, my young son was diagnosed with peanut allergy.  So, we have lots of this in our house.  I just bought the unsweetened version for myself, everyone else in the family likes the sweet ones.  I put about a tablespoon with jam on bread and you have the perfect peanut butter replacement.  I do not notice the lack of sugar.  I also have the Clown Gysin soy butter too.  It has a good flavor as well.  I think they put more oil in theirs since that version has more fat in it than the IM Healthy.  That is what makes the Clown Gysin version more peanut buttery sweetened than the IM Healthy.  Right now this is my favorite.

review/text: It's  not too sweet so it tastes great.  I don't like any nut butter that is sweetened with sugar.  Plus, this has more fiber than peanut butter so it's a great alternative for you Carb counters out there.  I use it in place of peanut butter for everything.  Just try it and you will see what I am talking about.

review/summary: soy butter
review/text: Im Healthy soy butter is wonderful.  My husband is alergic to peanuts but can eat soy butter.  It tastes just like peanut butter.  It is not like almomd butter where the oil separates and you have to keep it in the refrigerator.  It does not have to be stirred all the time and does not have to be refrigerated.  It is great.<br />I was so happy to find this on AMAZON.COM.  I used to buy it at Sprouts but they stopped carrying it and Trader Joe's did not have it either.  Amazon.com was great.  I had tried to order direct from the company but was unable to so this was the only way I could get the soy butter.

review/text: Soynut butter does not taste like peanut butter but is pretty good in its own right. We are a peanut free home due to allergies,and soy nut butter is a good alternative. This brand is high quality. No added sugars and great crunch. Tastes great on apples. Also one gets the great properties that soy contains.

review/text: I just received my order and love it. I did research and tried to find a sweetner that I could use with no aftertaste or chemical taste. This liquid sweetner to me is better than splenda because splenda leaves an after taste and I just don't like it at all. I do have to use a few more drops than in the directions but I am very pleased with this product. This will be my new sweetner because it's the closest thing to real sugar and I am a very happy camper!

review/text: This is a product my husband and I have searched for for some time.  We wanted sucralose without the addition of sugar that is used to make the powder form.  In small quantities the sugar is negligible, but my husband likes fresh lemonade in the summertime and used a large amount of Splenda in the past.  The EZ-Sweetz seems smoother than Splenda without any foam or aftertaste and no sugar.

I bought the 3 pack so that i could keep one in my purse, at work and give one to a friend who is also watching their carb intake. All it takes is two little drops in my medium coffee and it is the perfect amount of sweetness! I used to use 1 and 1/2 packs of splenda and it would get powder all over the place but not with this. i was super skeptical when i ordered it but not anymore. Buy them, you wont regret it!

When it arrived, all of the little packs are marked 30 cents!  Now I have to stock my entire concession stand with nickels and dimes and all of a sudden the flunkies I have working for me are going to have to count out real change and do real math to sell the merchandise when I had everything in multiples of a quarter.  I had actually planned to sell these for 50 cents, because people expect a certain markup, but they ARE very small.  They are good, and my ballplayers literally demand them, but I can't wait until they sell out.  Personally, I think if you sell pre-priced merchandise, you should so indicate.

review/summary: A Perfectly Decent Tea
review/text: A bit of background: I had a mind-blowing, amazing, world-changing earl grey green by "The Teaman" on Etsy. SO. GOOD. The Bigelow Earl Grey Green was good, but The Teaman's stuff was a portal to another world.*<br /><br />I more or less vibrated because I couldn't stop drinking all the caffeinated deliciousness, so the hunt to find a decaf version began.<br /><br />This tea isn't bad, but I think you get the idea that I'm stacking it against a rather compelling competitor. I didn't mind the mint, as another reviewer did, and felt it blended well with the other flavors present. The trouble for me was that this tastes like run-of-the-mill black tea, albeit with some additional flavors and complexity. Big kudos for harmony: all the flavors work well together. They just really, really aren't my thing.<br /><br />The main flavor seems to be the Breakfast Tea flavor. Yeah, they took Earl Grey Green and flavored it with black tea extract. I have no idea why. Black tea is a dime a dozen if you're into that kind of thing, and I'm not. I think my mother would adore this tea: she eschews most flavored tea and sticks to your basic blacks, though she does like Earl Grey.<br /><br />I will continue my hunt for an excellent decaf earl grey green. I suspect this one is for black tea lovers who want the health benefits of a green tea.<br /><br />*lest you think I'm a shill, I didn't care for the majority of his teas, but the earl grey green! Oh, heaven!!

review/summary: WOW! Like corn chips, smartfood, and popcorn all rolled into one!
review/text: Wow, are these good! They are crispy and crunchy, light and flaky, and still have a bit of texture and depth to them. Sometimes with "healthier" chips I feel like they are almost too light, but these feel like a REAL snack food.<br /><br />Their taste reminds me of SmartFood (which turned out not to be so smart) with a mixture of whole grain chips- there's a nice tang to the crunch.<br /><br />I'm a big corn chips fan- Fritos, tortilla chips, etc. I also love anything cheddar (Smartfood, Pirate's Booty, Cheez-It) so these were a GREAT find for me.<br /><br />The only downfall is 6 grams of fat per small snack-size bag. But at 140 calories, and the amount of flavor, it's well worth it. My entire family LOVES these chips and they are our new obsession.<br /><br />A NOTE ON SHIPPING FROM AMAZON: Almost every time I ordered these they said 3-5 weeks until shipment and wound up shipping just a few days after my order. So I think there's a glitch in the inventory system with this. Just a heads up so you don't order for more from another vendor.

review/text: I, too, think they taste a little strange-kind of sour-ish. They have a very unpleasant smell when a bag is first opened, but I think this is from the bleu cheese powder. After a few chips, the taste sort of grows on you, if you can ignore the almost-like-dirty-socks-smell. I probably will not order this brand again. I think Popchips taste much better, but I tried these because Popchips were more expensive. Sometimes you do get what you pay for. Not terrible, not great-just so-so.

I love how they have the crunch of a chip, but the air popped taste of popcorn. I like how they are healthier for you than your average potato chip and I am delighted that these are gluten free. I wish that every store near me sold them, but only BJ's Warehouse Stores do, and only in the Sea Salt flavor. So far my favorites are the White Cheddar and the Sea Salt. White Cheddar is a great alternative to smart food!

The taste is just like the title: corny with a light cheddar taste. These were so good I would be inclined to try the Sea Salt flavor because I liked the taste of the corn chips. For 140 calories you get something like 14 chips, a small amount of saturated fat and not a lot of sodium compared to other snacks. The only problem I found was when I got done with one bag I wanted to open another!

Also, the sea salt are very good,the popcorn flavor is good, but a little too salty for me. As you can tell I am a fan of these and have purchased lots of them. I wish Amazon would offer a subscribe and save on them.

review/text: Ok, my kid is VERY finicky. Things have to be made a certain way, etc. She also has food allergies, which in turn exacerbate her eczema, as well as seriously limiting what she can eat, even healthy stuff. Flax is good for eczema, but she doesn't like it added to cereal, won't do the oil, even when mixed w/maple syrup, etc. Enter these WONDERFUL crackers. Dehydrated at low temps to preserve the oil (& thus all the nutritional benefits), with no artificial colors or flavors, no gluten or other common allergens, etc., so it's the best flax cracker on the market (my opinion). We got some from a local health food store & gave 'em a try. She LOVES them!!! The only thing I don't like is the price, which is why I buy in bulk here @ Amazon. They keep for a long time! We plan to try all the flavors. She doesn't like the Onion n Garlic one (no one does but me - they say too spicy/hot), but I'm betting the Maple Cinnamon will be a hit. Ditto for the 'regular' flavor. Thanks, Amazon, for the great price!

review/text: This is my first Foods Alive product. I like them, but don't like them a lot. My biggest problem is that if you eat more then two or three crackers they coat your teeth and you spend the next half hour trying to get it off with your tongue! I will buy more and will try different flavors and varities. They are better with some kind of dip or cheese then just plain in my opinion.

review/text: I am experimenting with raw food.  This is o.k.  we don't like the slippery "seed" texture of it.  It just sort of melts back into seeds in your mouth.  If your real hard core raw vegan, then try it.  Other wise,  I would pass.

review/summary: Been a reliable cracker substitute
review/text: I like these because they deliver good protein, good fat and not a lot of carbs.  Subtract the fiber from the carbs and you got a negligible amount of carbs.  Theres no junk in these like other flax crackers, that often have some type of grain flour added.  These are pretty much as flaxy as you can get without making them yourself.  The italian zest is my 2nd favorite flavor of this product line, right behind the mexican harvest.

There are plenty of the regular kind though, but that is not what I want.

review/summary: Delicate flavour and smell
review/text: Delightfully fragrant after infusing in hot water. Delicate taste -- somewhat sweet and fruity, but the hint of ginger lingers (pleasantly) after the cup of tea is consumed.<br /><br />I first tried this particular flavour in a Tea Forte sampler gift, and I'm glad I got the loose leaf tea in this form. I won't say that this is great value for 50 servings, but the uniqueness of this blend redeems this purchase.

review/text: At first I have to say that I love tea, but especially black teas so I'm no expert in white teas. This one is definitely of good quality, but I don't like the taste at all. Too sweet for my understanding, and although I like fruity drinks, this tea seems to be close to pear juice, but still it is not.<br />It is worth a try if you're really into pear (I actually miss the strong ginger taste).

review/text: I am not a fan of coffee.  Sure, I'll admit that it tastes great.  Unfortunately, the way I feel afterwards isn't worth that flavor.  Coffee leaves me feeling anxious; my stomach feels like it's in knots.  My solution?  Tea.  This product, in particular, is a wonderful mid-day pick-me-up.  It leaves me feeling refreshed and energized without any funky side effects.  I'm not interested in most flavored teas, as they are usually sickly sweet.  This unsweetened tea has a wonderfully robust taste that you will find yourself craving.

review/summary: Excellent Coffee
review/text: I have been drinking French Roast coffee for over 20 years.  I was a little unsure about ordering 5lbs of coffee without trying it.  I was concerned about people who commented that it was not a true French Roast - well it is!<br />Occasionally I drink Vienna roast which is the lightest of the dark roasts - not as dark as French.  I don't like the burnt smokey taste of Italian roast.  So it's French roast for me.<br />I knew this coffee was good just by the slight aroma without even opening the bag.  The beans are the right color for a French Roast and slightly oily, as should be.<br />I boil the water and use a filter cone to make the coffee.  This coffee is rich just like a French Roast should be.  This is the French Roast for me from now on.<br /><br />May 2012(Follow-up review.  My third bag was a lighter roast - more like a Vienna roast - but still very good quality.

review/text: I'm a fairly awful and dedicated coffee snob but I go through so much coffee I thought it was worth giving a product that doesn't start with an "S" a try just to give my wallet a little relief (granted, if I'm going to unnecessarily spend money on anything, it will be good coffee).  I do have a strong preference for thick and smokey French roast flavors in the morning that linger with me and I grind the whole beans like I'm making Expresso.  Anyway, short story is that I'm on my fourth five pound bag.  For me, that's an very favorable review.

review/text: This is decent coffee but not what I'd call a true French Roast.  I've tried the Italian Roast as well and neither has that dark, rich, smokey flavor that I associate with a quality dark roasted coffee.  The beans are irregular in size and not uniform insofar as the surface oil is concerned.  Of course it is inexpensive so I suppose you get what you pay for...

review/summary: Great Coffee! - A LOT of it!
review/text: I almost didn't order this coffee because of some of the reviews that said it was not a true French Roast, but I am happy that they were wrong.  I have been using a French Roast from a local high end roaster that charges a premium price of their product.  This product is just as good as theirs, at half the cost.  My only concern is that since it is a five pound bag which is about a two months supply for me.  After researching the net, I found that if you can't use it up in 10 days to 2 weeks, that you should freeze it (once).  So I divided it up into ten day portions and am experimenting on the best method for freezing it.  Any recommendations?

review/summary: yummy, but I would not call it a french roast
review/text: While I think this coffee is delicious and rich tasting, I would not call it a french roast.  I know many places that would not even call it a full-city roast.  The beans are medium brown, with a little bit of oil.  I would have expected much darker, oilier beans from a french roast.  There is no smoky or burnt flavor to it at all.  I really do like it, but I would have called it a breakfast blend, not a french roast.

review/summary: Not really a French Roast.
review/text: This is good value for the $, but doesn't really qualify as a true French Roast, in my opinion. It has a nice flavor (though a bit too "winey" for my liking) and delivers a decent Espresso, but just doesn't quite hit the mark. Some have compared it to Starbucks French Roast, regarding it as comparable, but I disagree; the Starbucks, which has been my dark roast of choice for the past 2 years, is superior. It depends how choosy you are about your coffee, really. I'm sure many people will find this more than satisfactory. Just don't expect this to be a really DARK roast; its not.

review/text: We're just finishing the French Roast 5lb bag up.  This is our second 5lb bag from Coffee Bean Direct.  The first was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWMD2I">Dark Brazilian Santos, Whole Bean Coffee, 5 Pound Bag</a> which was good with a nice nuttiness and pretty full body. We like our coffee dark, bold and full bodied. I found this French Roast to not quite meet my expectation as a dark and full bodied coffee. That being said, it is fine coffee that has been my daily cup at home and been served to a multitude of house guests.<br /><br />So, I'm about to order another 5lb bag.  I'm probably going to give the Italian roast a try or may return to the Dark Brazilian Santos. Either way, we've weened ourself off $18 / lb specialty coffee roasters and have found a solid source of good coffee at a very reasonable price.

review/summary: I was hopeful, but disappointed.
review/text: I tried this product based on the majority of the recommendations being positive, and that some people even thought it was a rich coffee.  Another reason I tried it was a purchase of a different brand of French Roast coffee elsewhere which was plenty strong for my brewing method.  However, after receiving and drinking the coffee made from these beans, I can only agree with those who felt the coffee was weak in flavor; therefore I'll not be purchasing this coffee in the future.  A three star rating indicates, "It's OK", and I'll give it that much, but no more for my taste, and peoples' tastes vary widely.  One important factor is the preparation method, which undoubtedly varies between people offering reviews of this product.  I'm basing this on my preferred method of making coffee in a Keurig type coffee brewer using a My K-Cup insert.  Using that combination and various amounts of water with a grind size that has been good with other coffees I was unable to make a cup of coffee that satisfied me.  Staying in theme of the coffee's name, I may give my "French" press a try next.  I hope this helps you in making your decision.  Thanks for reading.

review/text: I was worried about ordering such a large bag without ever having tried this brand before.  It turned out I worried for nothing.  It's a tasty coffee at a fantastic price, and I'm happy to recommend it!  If you're a true coffee snob this might fall slightly short, but it ranks up there with the rest of the whole bean coffees available at my grocery store.  The only time I've tasted better was at one of those high end coffee shops with artisan beans.
