review/summary: Great for my dogs' digestion!
review/text: I have tried several brands of canned pumpkin for my dogs (and cat).  My veterinarian recommended it to help them naturally express their anal glands, which saves them a lot of pain and discomfort at the groomers.  (And helps the cat move hair through his system).  Using pumpkin has helped them a lot.  I like this brand because it is not as pricey as those that are sold specifically for pets, and it is a solid consistency (not as loaded with water as some other brands), and it is organic (just makes me feel a bit better), and it is reasonably priced (especially with the 15% discount for setting it up as a subscription item).  And there you have it!

review/summary: Recommendation depends on usage...
review/text: I have purchased this pumpkin from Amazon to help my cat lose weight and for baking.  The consistency is, well, for lack of better word, inconsistent.<br /><br />Sometimes we received firm canned pumpkin like the kind I grew up baking with, and other times we received a runny, really messy sort I would call puree.  I contacted the company and they said something about having an extraordinarily wet season.  Never did figure out what that had to do with the processing of the pumpkin...<br /><br />I do not know how other organic pumpkins fare or even if there is competition in the line of product.  Some cans were badly damaged in shipping which was a surprise and quite unfortunate.  Amazon's Customer Service was stellar as always and replaced what was damaged.<br /><br />As far as the consistencies go, if I still have the photos I took of the runny stuff, I will post them.  It's quite different from the firmer canned pumpkin!  I would recommend this for buying a lot of (for cats and dogs when it's a really good price), but honestly I don't use this for baking anymore because I never really know what I'll get.

review/summary: Organic Pumpkin at Bargain Price! No dented cans.
review/text: I have received two separate shipments of this product -- one in December, one in Janaury (2011) and not a single can was dented (some reviewers complained about dented cans so I'm assuming the issue has been resolved). The product is high quality. It is part of the diet I feed to my dogs (home prepared food only mostly raw meat) but I've eaten this pumpkin myself and it is a fine product.

review/text: I ordered two cases, which arrived in the same box this morning.  Packaging was in perfect condition.  One case of twelve was also in perfect condition, without a single dent.  However, the other case had 8 out of 12 cans dented, some badly. Since the packaging is clearly not damaged, I would take this to mean that the cans were already dented when they were packed.

review/summary: Delicious, no dented/damaged cans
review/text: I usually eat Libby's canned pumpkin; pumpkin isn't on the Dirty Dozen list [...] so buying organic wasn't a priority for me. But I eat pumpkin year-round and the stores around me were low on canned pumpkin, so I decided to order it.<br /><br />I hadn't actually tasted this particular product before ordering it from Amazon. I was a bit nervous that it would taste bad and I would be stuck with 12 cans.  Luckily, this canned pumpkin is delicious and I think it tastes better than Libby's. I usually eat it mixed with oatmeal or yogurt or in pumpkin smoothies.  Sometimes, I just eat it with some pumpkin pie spice and sweetener.<br /><br />All the cans arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />I ordered this  item on December 17, 2010.

review/summary: Great Pumpkin, All But Two Cans Dented
review/text: When I ordered this organic pumpkin product, there was a problem with customers receiving dented cans. Amazon/Farmer's Market Foods was assessing the situation to resolve this problem, and the pumpkin was not being sold. When, I assumed, they had finally resolved the dented cans situation, I was able to order.<br /><br />I received the case of pumpkin puree and the box seemed really well packaged, so I was surprised to find all but 2 of the 12 cans DENTED. I'm almost certain the problem is occurring at the manufacturing plant, because the cans in the middle of the case were all dented. Be informed the problem is not resolved, yet.<br /><br />I went ahead and used the pumpkin from a dented can as there was no indication the product was tainted (Push on the top and bottom of the can. If the top or bottom of the can moves in any way or makes a popping sound, the can's seal has been broken and air has made its way inside). The pumpkin tasted fresh and had a very succulent, moist consistency and it is organic. I would definitely recommend this brand of pumpkin IF they resolve their dented can problem, especially since you can't find pumpkin in the grocery stores at this time (due to the destroyed pumpkin crop in the Fall of 2009).

review/summary: Who Knew? Pumpkin Shortage!!?
review/text: I actually feed my cats pumpkin to maintain a healthy digestive system and they love it! Unfortunately there has been a pumpkin shortage in the stores. The only canned pumpkin available was the organic at Amazon. I have never used this before. Although the cats eat it, I was disappointed because it is very "watery". I just wonder if this will impact pumpkin pies at Thanksgiving if we still have a shortage!

review/summary: Pumpkin for Dogs diet shortage - Saved by this product!
review/text: This pumpkin product arrived in good condition and is all that was available after the almost year-long shortage due to Libby pumpkin running out during the 2009 holiday season. My dogs get pumpkin with each meal to help with their digestive system working properly and it works great. Thanks to Farmer's Brand for having enough product to fill our needs. It is more expensive to order online, naturally, but between my 'stop gap' measures of baking squash to serve to my dogs, and alternating between meals with Farmers Brand pumpkin, we will be able to make it through to the next harvest season, where I feel we should purchase our own warehouse full of pumpkin in case the shortage hits us again next year. Thank you Farmers brand and Amazon for helping us through your being prepared to offer your products to us on line. My dogs thank you too... woof!;- )

review/summary: A workable alternative to Libby's pumpkin during their shortage.
review/text: Like a number of other reviewers, we use canned pumpkin as a dietary supplement for our dogs. As a result, we go through a lot of it. We usually use the Libby's brand which is readily available in our grocery store, but due to flooding of last year's crop it has been out of stock for a few months. Luckily the organic growers did not have the same problem. I find this product to be more finely pureed than the Libby's so it seems a bit runnier. However, my dogs love it. The only minor disadvantage is the cost. It is more expensive than the Libby's, plus I'm paying to have it shipped now vs. picking it up at the store.<br /><br />A number of other Amazon customers have complained about receiving badly dented cans. Mine arrived 100% intact. This may be a result of the unconventional courier used. It appeared to be some sort of private delivery service though I paid for the standard service. A man hand delivered the item to my house using what appeared to be his ordinary Chrysler Pacifica minivan. I've never seen an item delivered this way by Amazon or anybody before.

review/summary: Dented Cans!
review/text: I ordered a few days ago and some of my cans arrived dented. Multiple cans were on the outside edge of the box, but only one row (3 cans total with 2 severely dented) was dented. So, I guess packaging could have been a small factor. BUT these cans are amazingly malleable. Simply squeezing the can in my hand caused it to yield. The small area containing air space is very weak. Libby's canned pumpkin, the brand I've used my entire life, does not have this issue.<br /><br />I already cooked with one of the non-dented cans. The color is different than what I'm used to, it's more of a dirty orange-sepia color, and the texture seems a bit thicker, but it tastes fine.<br /><br />My order also had a long expiration date, 2013.<br /><br />(FYI The packaging consisted of a large box containing a smaller box of cans with bags of air to keep it from rattling. There was no damage or excessive wear on the box. )

review/text: We're huge pumpkin lovers in this house, but it's one of the few things I prefer canned versus fresh. This brand is excellent. There is a huge difference between this brand versus Libby's, or any store brand for that matter. Farmer's Market is thicker and has a much stronger pumpkin taste. And to top it off, it's not only organic but now the label says "BPA free lining" (I don't remember seeing that in the past, so maybe it's a new thing for the company?) which is a huge plus.

I was pleased with the way they handled my concern, and the replacement arrived very quickly. The pumpkin tastes wonderful and we have used it in several recipes. Organic canned pumpkin at my local grocery store is outrageously priced compared to purchasing this off Amazon. Even better, the shelf life on the cans I received was very generous. Overall we're very pleased with this product and will order more for our pantry when our stock runs low.

review/summary: Great Pumpkin Feast
review/text: I ordered this recently when it when I noticed the price dropped to $1.23 a can on Subscribe and Save.  I'd hesitated ordering in the past because of the issues with dented cans in some earlier reviews but couldn't resist trying it at that price.  I was pleasantly surprised to get a case of perfect cans that were packed in a reinforced box. The expiration date is 2014 which makes them fresh. I wish I'd ordered more!<br /><br />The consistency of the pumpkin itself has also been good, not watery.  I've purchased this brand at my local market and never had an issue.  This is not a Puree like Libby's Pure Pumpkin, it's more dense, a firmer molded pumpkin.  It has about 10 more calories per serving than Libby's and has higher nutritional stats in vitamin content.  I happen to like both consistencies but prefer organic given I use it almost daily in one form or another. It works as a healthy replacement (along with unsweetened applesauce) in baking muffins, scones, cakes, pancakes, etc. I freeze it into 4 oz sized cubes and use it for Pumpkin Spice smoothies (delicious!). It's great in soups and some chili recipes too. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Great price!
review/text: I love to make pumpkin muffins and bread. I first ordered this product over a year ago when pumpkin was hard to find in the store. Although I like to use natural/organic products, pumpkin is not necessarily one of those things that you need to have organic (due to the thick rind). However, the price of this is impossible to pass up - with S&S, the per can price is cheaper than the local store generic! I didn't think there was much of a difference in taste, until recently I made my muffins with another "name brand" pumpkin-my muffins were just OK, certainly not as yummy as usual. The pumpkin was the only difference. So here I am ordering more! Unless the price shoots up dramatically, I won't use anything else.<br /><br />I didn't realize the dented can thing was a widespread issue. If I remember correctly, I do think some of my cans in my first order were dented, but not badly enough to make them unusable (obviously - we've eaten them all with delicious results and no ill effects LOL!)<br /><br />UPDATE: This latest order arrived in perfect shape in a well reinforced box - no dents or dings anywhere!

I am rethinking Amazon's subscription service for food items.  There is no savings if the product is virtually unusable.  Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the actual product because of the condition the cans arrived in.

review/text: I have bought "Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin(100%)" for years from coops, health/natural groceries, but now Amazon Subscribe and Save is my supplier for cost and free shipping.  Pumpkin is a great source of Vit.A(380%), Fiber(16%), Iron(10%), Phytocytes, etc per 50cal/serving, but this brand TASTES good, as well as, provides nutrition.  I generally eat it right from the can for an evening snack; the product is that good.

review/text: Farmer's Market pumpkin tastes great. I add it to all kinds of desserts, dishes and breads and it always performs wonderfully. Even my dogs like to have a bite of the plain pumpkin now and then. My only complaint about this pumpkin is that it is not available in larger cans!

review/summary: My 3 dogs love it!
review/text: I home cook for my dogs, including plenty of fiber-containing veggies, brown rice, barley, etc., but one little guy has "poop issues" and literally cries out in pain.  Just breaks my heart.  So I started adding pumpkin to their doggie stew to make things a little softer and easier to pass (was that too much information), and that really helps.  Unfortunately, canned pumpkin is only available in my area around Thanksgiving and Christmas.  What?  Don't people eat pumpkin other times?  Not really expecting to find it, I decided to check Amazon and was delighted to find this product available and on "autoship" no less! A little worried about getting a bunch of crumpled cans, but really needed it, so placed an order, and thankfully only one can had a tiny dent; I've seen worse on the store shelves.  Not a pumpkin fan myself, but I did take a taste, and the flavor and texture is much better than what I usually get in the store (so maybe I'll become a fan after all), and the furkids love, love, love it! Whew, what a relief!

review/text: Good product, nicer than the big name brand we had been buying. Better flavor and texture than Libby's. The price is great; I set up the subscribe and save option for delivery every couple of months so I can have pumpkin year round. Why do I use so much pumpkin? In addition to making delicious soup and baked goods, it is a great food suppliment for my dog. It helps keep his system moving right along, if you get my drift. It also works for cats. Most dogs and cat love pumpkin almost as much as I do.

review/summary: Fair Chocolate Taste
review/text: Pre-maid pudding seems to come in a couple of varieties.  The really good kind that makes you glad the cups are small, and the not-so-good kind that makes you long for the kind your mother used to make.  This pudding falls in the second category.  This pudding is okay on an occasional basis, but the chocolate flavor seems a little off.  It is difficult to describe what I mean, but the flavor just does not quite have the power of home-made chocolate pudding.<br /><br />I have tasted a number of other pre-made puddings, and several of them are very good.  The vanilla and the tapioca are generally very good to excellent.  The lemon is also very good.  However, the chocolate seems to fall short in tast quality, and while I will eat it occasionally, if you have a choice between home-made and this one, choose the home made.

review/summary: Remember the Best Days of Childhood with Strawberry Jam
review/text: Some eat jam because they are hungry. Some eat jam to forget. I eat strawberry jam to remember.<br /><br />How many years has it been since I was six, and Nancy was six, and we both sat in the lunchroom nervously confused that first week of first grade?<br /><br />How long has it been since I opened my brown bag in despair, seeing I had only half of a great sandwich? The half missing was the jam. I had two slices of white bread surrounding a couple swooshes of peanut butter.<br /><br />What all has passed since Nancy, my neighbor from three doors down to the south, smiled (as she always would)and gave me half of her cleanly sliced PBJ?<br /><br />Her grace and friendship then was not forgotten, and every year, every autumn, I find myself with some jam, a spoon and a smile, wondering if she remembers too.<br /><br />Grade A, and fancy, and as tasty as any jam outside of your mom's recipe, Smucker's is my regular choice. I hope it helps remind you of good days when you were six.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/summary: Shake Hands With The Devil
review/text: I've tried a lot of energy drinks and for some reason this one, in this particular flavor, lights up the receptors in my brain like Christmas Eve on State Street.<br /><br />Red Bull, RockStar, Amp, SoBe and all the rest don't compare in my opinion. This is the stuff.  The Big Green Monster.<br /><br />As I write this I'm listening to DJ Splash and I'm about to start my second 16oz. can.  There was a time when I hated trance/dance music and didn't drink "soda,"  but now the two seem like a marriage consecrated in the holiest of heavens.  By the way, it's only noon.<br /><br />My path to Monster Enlightenment was born out of my video game addiction.  Playing until 4am and getting to work by 7am was turning into a bit of a hassle.  Coffee can only do so much, and that's when I started to drink rocket fuel like a meth addict.  One can a day used to do the trick -- and best of all -- it satisfied my appetite too.  Who needs nourishment when you can get by on sugar and caffeine and a few vitamins sprinkled on top for fun?  I wasn't a tub before by any means, but I'm about 15 pounds lighter than last summer.<br /><br />But the days of single cans are in the past. I'm currently trying to ween myself of satan's nectar.  A 16oz can is around $2.35 at most stores, so if I have two a day it's pretty similar to if I had a moderate smoking habit.<br /><br />The withdrawl is pretty unpleasant, too. I'm not sure of the addictiveness of Taurine, but Caffeine isn't something to be scoffed at. Your body adapts to Monster's boost pretty quickly, and before too long your body expects it, longs for it.  It becomes harder to get through the day without it.  I have been known to drink it warm and/or flat.<br /><br />So why the five star rating?  Because this stuff is awesome and I love it.  I love it even though I'm probably going to end up with intestinal cancer because of it.  I also like the flavor the best out of all the energy drinks.<br /><br />Just be wary, drink it when you need it, not as a substitute for your regular drink. This is - by no means - a health drink.<br /><br />[...]

review/text: My one complaint is the package clearly indicates the pasta cooks quickly...in 8-9 minutes. Well, I've prepared it twice now and both times took a minimum of 20 minutes to get the middle to soften up. Keep that in mind when making dinner because it definitely is not going to cook nearly as fast as the bag indicates.<br /><br />On a positive note, the product tastes fairly good. It also works well as a cold pasta for salads and, of course, the fact that it is gluten-free is a healthy choice for those with gluten intolerance.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars because it's a middle-of-the-road review for me. Good points and bad...so it's about average.

It would not work well for a pasta salad.  I have used this pasta for mac & cheese and it was only slightly firmer the next day.  I have put the day old pasta in boiling water for a minute to soften it up and it works, only problem is that it makes the pasta fall apart easier.  Anyhow, if you're willing to put up with a few differences from standard wheat pasta, it is really an excellent product.

However, I find I can always adjust a mix to suit me. All the spices I've ordered from this company have been great and I've used them for years.

review/summary: Effective and easy to drink
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by this tea... I'm in good health generally and I don't take any medications.  I ordered this because the other reviews intrigued me, and I knew I wanted to gently support my liver & kidneys.  I'm not an expert on elimination or anything, but I feel like this makes those processes more effective.  Since last summer I've been on a mission to lose about 25 pounds, so I changed my diet and exercise habits, and lost 20 lbs by November; that seemed to be my limit and I was OK with it.  I started drinking this tea right after Christmas and after 2 weeks, I lost 3 lbs!  I know I probably shouldn't attribute this to the tea but it's the only change that I made to my routine... I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a weight loss product but I mention it because it was an unexpected side benefit to me.  I think it does just make it so my body can get rid of waste more completely, on a consistent basis.<br /><br />It tastes good to me, earthy and mild... I like that it doesn't have as strong a licorice flavor like a lot of the Yogi Teas seem to, though it does contain licorice root.  I drink it plain, hot and strong, usually 2 teabags in a 20-oz mug or 1 bag in a smaller mug.  I like to drink it in the morning, and again in the late afternoon when I'm at work.  Since it doesn't contain tea, I like steeping it for even longer than 5 minutes to get the most out of it.  I usually take green tea in the morning, so I've been combining that with the Detox Tea but am going to try the Skin Detox Tea instead, to make it easier.  Also I feel the green tea detracts from the flavor of the Detox Tea somewhat although I still find it perfectly palatable.  Hope this helps!

review/summary: Yogi Detox Tea
review/text: I was recommended to drink this by a former American medic who had done a tour in Iraq. I'm not sure if I can even discern the level of effectiveness, but I seem to feel like I have flushed out some toxins, based on the lessening of some ill feeling I was experiencing before taking the month-long experiment of using it three times a day. All my study on the ingredients leads me to believe that I chose the best of the versions of a detoxifying drink. The price was right, too.

review/summary: Yummy tea!
review/text: This tea was very smooth and comforting. I usually don't go for anything licorice flavored, but found that this tea is a nice combo of chai flavors with some anise undertones. I think it would be more than tolerable to someone who hates black licorice like I do! I'm not sure if it actually detoxes, but after drinking it (with food) for about 3 days I started getting rid of water weight and felt more alert without being caffenated which is definitely a plus. I had a little more energy and my mood calmed a bit. I think it needs to be consumed for a longer period of time maybe 2 weeks or more in order to really feel results, but that's the basic principle when it comes to detoxing with any tea or diet foods. I only had 3 bags of it so obviously it would have benefitted me had I a few boxes of this stuff. Good tea!

review/summary: One of the best teas....
review/text: I've been drinking this tea now for 3 weeks straight. The first weeks I was only drinking in the morning after my workouts and it really helped boost my energy in the morning and was a great part of my morning breakfast. I also notice that my skin cleared up really nicely. I've never had problem skin but it is smoother now than ever before so I believe the detoxing benefits are kicking in. This last week, I've been drinking it after I get home from work, before dinner and I just can't seem to go a day without it. Very soothing and the taste isn't bad at all.  Would recommend it to everyone. I'm not a big tea drinking but I will buy this tea in bulk because it really makes a difference.

review/text: I wasn't sure about this tea at first because I had tried several other teas that contained licorice that were just too sweet for me. However, I'm pleasantly surprized by the light, tangy flavor of this tea. The sweetness is there, but it's not overwhelming. I'm not certain that it's done much for me in relation to "detox," but I certainly like the taste, especially after lunch. It seems to settle my stomach and help me digest.

review/text: I wanted this tea for the detoxification properties but was wary of what the taste would be like. I really despise licorice and was concerned that this may be overly strong due to all the herbs. This is a very sweet, very balanced and smooth tea. I'm not crazy about the taste but I can drink it every day with ease. The licorice is more of a sweetness than it is a flavor. It starts out a little peppery and is backed by strong sweetness and light floral notes. It tastes better warm than cold.

I just recently got in touch with preventative herbal ideology and decided to get cloves, dandelion and ginger. Then I found this tea, and knew I had to order it. I'm not a picky eater, so I'm not the best person to ask about the taste, I say most things taste good. But I can testify to the efficacy of many of the ingredients listed here. If you like some of the other Yogi teas, you'll probably like this one to. It does have a kick to it (have you ever had fresh ginger?), but I like it, and I will continue to order it because it helps me relax and feel good.

review/text: I picked this box accidentally at the grocery store instead of Yogi Skin DeTox. Quality-wise, Yogi makes fine herbal tea in my opinion. I mostly drink plain black tea but when I want it decaf and I'm too lazy for loose tea, I go for Yogi :)<br />As for this particular combination, I found its taste pleasant but not everyone agreed with me on this. It has a strong-ish black-pepper-mixed-with-cinnamon taste and a bit of (lemony?) ginger. I'd say if you are looking for some herbal tea only for the taste of it, this may not be it. Yet, just looking at the ingredients list makes me want to drink this tea.. it just looks so healthy. So I'll keep a box around and alternate it with Skin Detox maybe, which has a much milder, rosy flavor to it.

review/text: I had to choke down the first cup of this tea. It burned the back of my throat and made my tummy rumble a lot. But once I got used to the taste and how to drink it (not super hot and sipping slowly) I love it. It is definitely dehydrating and will make you pee alot, so be sure to drink lots of water, too.<br /><br />Drinking this daily at bedtime has been really beneficial to me. Even if it's just a placebo, I love it. In combination with lots of vitamins, exercise, and good nutrition, I'm seeing the weight come off a lot faster than before. I know it's probably water but hey, you gotta start somewhere!<br /><br />Highly recommend. Spicy, sweet without adding anything, like chai with a bit more licorice scent. Yummy.

review/summary: Hate the smell but love the taste :)
review/text: The fact that this tea is 'detoxifying' really intrigued me and so I picked it up at my local grocery store. :) So far I've been drinking it for a few days and I'm liking the way it makes me feel, although for any real health benefits I'm sure I'll have to drink it for longer.<br /><br />When I first opened the box to use it I have to say I was disappointed. For me the smell is kind of off-putting and I was sure I wasn't going to like the taste. But I'd already bought it so I decided to brew a cup anyway just to see how it turned out.<br /><br />I love adding fresh lemon slices or small 'cutie' mandarin oranges to my tea for sweetner (because I don't use sugar), and so for this tea I added the juice of one mandarine orange (along with the actual little orange pieces, love having them and seeing them in my tea!) And it turns out as much as I hate the smell (still do...) I love the taste! With the fresh mandarine oranges it really gives it a taste reminiscent of apple cider (weird, but true, and really good). Also, I absolutely hate black licorice, but I really like this tea, so I'm thinking it won't be a problem for others who dislike licorice as well...<br /><br />It's a very strong tea with bold flavors and is a really good replacement for coffee, at least for me. :) Don't be afraid to try it. :)

review/text: I JUST bought this tea today after reading all about it. It started with reading about Jillian Michaels water mixture that had dandelion root tea in it and I came across the yogi tea. I figured I'd give it a go from the good reviews. Although I can't say anything about the detoxing effects as I haven't used it long enough...I can say the taste is just fine. I am not typically a herbal or licorice liking person. I usually hate the taste. This tea isn't bad at all. I brewed it in a small amount of hot water then made it into iced tea (it's still hot out!) Didn't add sugar or anything which I typically do and I think it's bearable for sure. I'll come back when I've drank it a few weeks and with hope I feel as fabulous as the other commenter's here :)

review/summary: Cured my Pneumonia
review/text: A year ago I found out I had Pneumonia, I panicked because I have never been that sick before in my life. I was given antibiotics to cure it. Well a week and a half after taking and finishing the antibiotics, my symptoms returned. I realized there would be no need to go back to the doctors because they obviously can't do anything for me. Because I am in to herbs anyways,  I decided take Beta Glucan capsules. It was working but not fast enough for me. So I decided to drink this Herbal detox tea along with the herbal capsules. It got rid of my symptoms in two day. I completed the whole box of teas and bottle of herbs capsules. I did not have anymore problems or pneumonia after that. I would highly recommend this tea to anyone who might have the same illness, or coming down with a flu. Or someone who just wants a good detox.

review/summary: YUCK
review/text: I ordered because of the great price....BUT yuck the stock is stale .<br />Tastes like old iced ted left in the fridge toooo long.<br />Not my first yogi tea flavor and not my first box of detox , so know it is not supposed to taste like this. Worst part that is the one I ordered the most of :} Others seem fine so far :}

review/summary: I hate this tea
review/text: It does cause you to have more bowel movements.<br />But causes stomach cramps after 7 days and blood in stool.<br />Do not recommend you drink this more than few days.<br /><br />Anybody want to buy some sealed boxes, only used the first one?

review/summary: Well, it works....
review/text: There is no doubt that this tea does it's job, but the smell of it is awful. I normally don't have any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things, but I have such an aversion to the smell of this tea. It has a top note of moldy, dank earth with a base note of acrid peppers gone bad. The box says that it contains "delicious sasparilla". I don't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer in it at all. If you can bear the smell and aftertaste then go for it.

review/summary: From great to gross...
review/text: This product used to be excellent.  Recently its quality has gone way down and they changed the box...it makes no sense why they'd change their best tea like that.

review/summary: tastes awful
review/text: I took 3 sips of these tea, and I nearly gagged.  I think it tastes spicy, like nutmeg.  I can't stand the taste or smell of nutmeg, so I can't drink this tea. Just my two cents.

review/summary: Poison Tea
review/text: I don't recommend drinking this tea quickly, or while on medication. I was on antibiotics and a decongestant and was starting to feel better.  Then, when I drank this tea (one cup in 30 minutes), I felt worse and nauseated.  I don't know if it's the tea itself, or a reaction with the other things in my body, but I'm going to steer clear of this tea.
