review/summary: Best Almonds Hands Down
review/text: After trying every kind of almond out there over the years, I will take these flavorful Blue Diamond almonds any day.  They are fresh, salted just right and not greasy/oily.  I try to eat a handful a day, usually as a mid-afternoon snack for optimum health benefits. The handy container is easy to use and even indicates portion size.  Unfortunately, this type of almonds is getting more and more difficult to find in my local stores, so I was happy to be able to order a 6-pack from Amazon to have in my pantry.

review/summary: Our favorite
review/text: These are our absolute favorite almonds and love that there isn't any fake sugars in them.  I'll take more calories with real sweeteners any day over sucralose in the other brands. And this flavor is DELICIOUS.  YUM!

review/summary: Yummy in my Tummy :)
review/text: I ordered these lovely almonds a few weeks ago, as I often find myself jonesing for junk food, and I thought that if I had something that was good for me around, I would be less likely to grab something terrible.  These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.  I love these and I eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins :)

review/text: These are incredible!  Eating these makes me not want to eat candy.  I love these!  The price isn't that great though.  I think Blue Diamond should save money by packaging them in something cheaper than plastic.  I did notice it on Amazon in a box, but the price looks odd - over $50?  Too bad Amazon doesn't stock this, so no Free Shipping.

review/text: I've tried several of the Blue Diamond jar almonds and the Butter Toffee almonds are the best.  They would probably be my favorite almond, but they're high-carb. I guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time....  We can all do that, right?  :-)<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars -- my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt -- but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception.

review/text: I must say, these almonds have made me a lover of nuts!!!  I have always been a cashew girl and never cared that much for almonds. Well, being on a low carb diet made cashews a no no.  Almonds roasted only with sea salt are soooo good. Blue Diamond makes the best tasting and these are hard to find in stores.  I love the 1 lb bag of these, but can't seem to find them. Buying these in bulk was the best deal out there and I will have to purchase again.  Thanks, Blue Diamond for a superior nut!

review/text: So the hottest-hot-off-the-press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away.... and for good reason.  They're full of B (and other) vitamins, fiber, --not-cholesterol, not-sodium, not-empty calories, and not tasteless wallpaper paste....<br /><br />But these --- these new Blue Diamond almonds (I've so far tried both the Brown Sugar Cinnamon and the Vanilla -- are soooooo good that it's hard to stop at an ounce.  This has become my after-dinner treat.<br /><br />To help fight the sodium bugaboo, they've instead coated them with a velvet dairy whey based powder (take note, lactose-intolerant folks) that is loaded with flavor.  They're not sweet -- except the sweetness of the lactose.  And they're not the least bit salty.  They taste like a great dessert in both flavor and texture.<br /><br />Thumbs way up -- licking my fingers kind of up.

review/summary: NOT as good as the ones in the tins
review/text: Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that "oven roasted" + "honey" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.

review/text: My mother and my father had ordered this as an Easter gift for me. They bought in "the online candy shop" trough Amazon on April 9th and payed $25.00 for EXPEDITED delivery. They told me I should receive it by the 12th at the latest, because as stated in the store's shipping policy, expedited to US address takes 1-3 business days. Not only I just received it late afternoon on 04/16, when I opened the box all I could find was melted chocolate all around. I was very very upset and even more when I came to Amazon to leave a neg review and found out it was supposed to be shipped with a gift wrap and nice bow. That's what my parents had payed for (and obviously to send me edible chocolate!). And i was amazed to see that in the shop's shipping policies I found the information: "Expedited orders will be packed with reusable ice packs and insulation at no additional charge. The Online Candy Shop is not responsible for damage of meltable items during shipping, unless an expedited shipping method is chosen."<br />In my case, the expedited shipping didn't come with ice packs and insulation, and neither the nice gift wrap that's in the product description page. Not to mention is IS NOT 1 pound of chocolate. it's written on the box, it's 14 ounces. NEVER BUY FROM THIS STORE. I never had even a slight problem with amazon marketplace purchases before.

Getting the foil off each coin was a production. It took a few minutes to scrape off all the little bits of foil to get to a piece of gum the size of a quarter.

The pastry is light and crispy, with a nice flavor, and the icing is a little drizzle, not completely covering the pastry. One pack (25g) has two little crisps for 100 calories, 80mg of sodium, and 7g of sugar (one whole grain cinnamon Pop Tart (50g serving size) is: 200, 160, 12). On its own, it is not very filling.

review/summary: Light, Crisp and Good--Just a Little Too Sweet
review/text: I'm not a sweets eater, preferring starchy salty things for snacks, but I crave a little something sweet every now and then. The little 100-calorie packs of other sweets are a good choice for me, because they are just small, low-calorie packs of sweet things to eat. Here recently, I've gone to eating gluten-free and all-natural, so I don't really eat this type of food any more. I preface my review with that, so everyone is clear that this isn't my normal type of food when I am judging a rating on it, and my rating might be affected by the fact I usually don't eat processed foods. My daughter bought two boxes of these the other day--and cinnamon and brown sugar are two flavors I really love for the limited sweets I do eat--so she let me have one.<br /><br />They are very sweet. For me, they are too sweet... way too sweet. But for someone who likes sweets, I would imagine they are just the perfect amount of sweetness. What I really liked about them was the crispy, flakiness. They have this nice softish outer shell of pastry, but this nice, crisp, brittleness that makes them crunchy too. In flavor, they are like a thin, crispy pop tart. It's like all the good stuff of a pop tart without all the 'excess' pastry that pop tarts have that I don't like. I love the crispness.<br /><br />My BFF tried the chocolate ones and said it was very good and didn't have any powder 'fake' chocolate taste that some chocolate products have. She liked the crispiness of it too.<br /><br />So if you're a sweets eater, these small little pop-tart-like treats are probably going to be the perfect little snack item and if you can bring yourself to eat only one package of them (there are two small 'sticks' or 'bars' in each interior package), then it's only 100-calories and might fit in well with a low-calorie and/or low-fat diet plans too. They are not, however, good for low-carbing or Paleo or all-natural diets. For older kids and teenagers, they are probably a great slightly healthier substitution for pop tarts too.

review/summary: Read the ingredients list BEFORE you buy this...
review/text: Well, I wanted to get these for our cats. I am always looking for things without a lot<br />of grain in them, since we have one cat who gets hot spots if he eats corn or wheat products.<br />As you can imagine, that limits things a lot.<br /><br />I thought this was interesting, because it had rabbit in it. Now, the listing here offers VERY little<br />information, being really vague about the ingredients, etc etc. I wasn't sure if they actually had<br />rabbit in them, or was another reference. So, did some research and wanted to share the list.<br /><br />Here's what is in these "healthy" treats:<br /><br />Rabbit, Rice Flour, Barley Flour, Whole Ground Potato, Maple Syrup, Chicken Meal, Natural Flavor, Tapioca Starch, Glycerine, Cane Molasses, Brewer's Yeast, Canola Oil, Salt, Phosphoric Acid, Sorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Mixed Tocopherols, Rosemary Extract.<br /><br />CALORIE CONTENT (calculated):<br />This treat contains 2,800 kcal/kg or<br />1 kcal/piece ME (metabolized energy)<br />on an as fed basis (calculated).<br /><br />You know, I just don't see cats needing maple syrup or cane molasses. It has to be bad for their teeth.<br />There's also a LOT of starch/carbohydrates in these treats, and cats don't really need a lot of carbs<br />in their diet either - they are MEAT eaters. For something that touts itself as uber healthy, these don't<br />seem to meet the mark. I'm not sure if they call themselves "healthier" because there isn't any corn meal<br />in them, or what yardstick they really used.<br /><br />Decide for yourselves, but be very cautious. We changed our minds about letting<br />the cats have them after reading the ingredients.

The ingredients are very healthy and rabbit is a very lean meat, so I feel good knowing their treats are also good for them.  The little shape of them seems to be appealing to my cats as well, making them fun to chew.

review/summary: Natural Balance Perfect Bites are great!!
review/text: My kitty Leila is soooo picky.  She saw me giving treats to my dogs, and so I wanted to reward her as well, but obviously can't give her dog treats.  I tried some other natural cat treats on the market but she turned her nose up at them.  I bought these Natural Balance Perfect Bites cat treats at the store last week and she LOVED THEM!  Now I can reward both my cat and my dogs!

review/summary: Ignored first few weeks but slowly gave into these treats...
review/text: My cat didn't like these too much... they unwillingly gave in as I did not want these to go to waste (had to delay a dinner for them for maybe an hour). That did the trick and now they are eating it. It does seem like it's one of the healthier treats out there, though.

review/summary: VERY HOT and Salty
review/text: By itself this product is a Super-Hot, salty, Tomato/Potato gruel with some other vegetables and spices.  By itself this product's heat, salt and mushy texture doesn't appeal to my palate, though the Pav Bhaji makes for a decent chip dip.  I may buy 'Truly Indian Bombay Pav Bhaji' again if the price is right, however, because it gives a lot of fire, depth and flavor to other soups, stews, chili, etc.  I especially love mixing it with 'La Preferida Refried Beans Rancheros - Zesty Salsa'.  Beware of the Pav Bhaji's high salt content of 510mg per 1/2 cup serving (21% of daily allowance).  3.25 Stars.

review/summary: Good Quality -- Beware Gluten Contamination
review/text: I debated between these dried beans and the BPA-free canned variety from the same company  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZU7QQ">Eden Organic Garbanzo Beans, No Salt Added, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.  Both were highly reviewed, but with a little calculation I saw that one box of the dried variety would yield the equivalent of 5 cans of cooked beans (about 7-1/2 cups), which made the price per serving of the dried about 40% of the price of the canned. Dried beans are not hard to cook, and 60% savings seemed worth the effort.<br /><br />So I ordered a case of dried beans along with a case of sesame seeds  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LPKEMU">Bob's Red Mill White Sesame Seeds, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> to try my hand at making homemade hummus.  Both arrived fairly quickly (ordered August 30, arrived September 3; it seems that amazon's shipping just isn't as quick as it used to be), and I got started right away making the hummus.<br /><br />I noticed that the beans were really clean, so little rinsing was necessary.  I also saw that there were no malformed or defective beans.  I followed the perfectly simple "quick soak" and cooking instructions on the box, rinsing the beans between steps.  After first soaking for 90 minutes, the beans cooked beautifully in a little under 90 minutes more and were so soft that I was able to mash them in my Kitchenaid mixer; no food processor necessary!  We used the hummus recipe on the back of Bob's Sesame Seeds bag, minus half of the garlic, and it's definitely in the same league as any storebought I've ever tried.<br /><br />The disappointing part is that midway through the cooking process I noticed a little disclaimer near the bottom of the box in small, non-bold font: "Packed on equipment that handles wheat."  My family eats gluten free due to our child's Celiac Disease, and the risk of cross contamination in this naturally gluten free product, offered by a company that produces many fabulous g free items, was a surprise to me.  I had ordered a case, for crying out loud, and neither amazon nor Eden Organic made any statement on their websites regarding the possibility of cross contamination.  (Mind you, the canned variety is advertised as gluten free.  Apparently it isn't packaged on the same production line.)  Because only one of our family members has a medical reason to eat g free, the rest of us were able to eat (and really enjoy) the hummus, but I was pretty disappointed that the snack I'd planned for us all was off-limits to our celiac child.<br /><br />Bottom line for this product: great quality bean that I intend to use.  However, I won't purchase it again due to risk of gluten contamination.  (Amazon & Eden Organic, please post the disclaimer on your websites in the product descriptions for those of us gluten free customers that need to know this information!)

review/summary: Dried Garbanzo Beans
review/text: I used these beans to make hummus and they worked wonderfully.<br /><br />I used the overnight soaking method (on package). I also added a stick of kombu (which Eden also sells) to the water.<br /><br />The beans in the package were clean with no extraneous debris.<br /><br />Before deciding to buy this product I visited the Eden web site as amazon.com is very lacking in the information and support they provide for the food stuffs they sell.<br /><br />One concern I have is the expiration date on the package. It's 120C28. I assume this code is made deliberately so that I will not be able to tell whether I'm getting a product that is at the end of its shelf life. With six boxes that is a concern.

review/summary: yummy organic chickpeas
review/text: These are the only chickpeas I buy. They are fresh, a quick overnight soak makes them nice and plump and I cook them in about 1 hr, salting 15 mins before they are completely cooked. Chickpeas you cook yourself taste almost sweet and Eden's are great. The company does a great job of cleaning these little guys, I rarely, if ever, find stones or similar things after opening the box. Great value on Amazon.

The spices are all there and nothing could be easier....I use with ground turkey now and you can't tell the difference. Best thing, you can always depend on the taste....mine before would one time be good and the next time maybe be horrible.  Try it...you'll like it!!!!

However, the cost of shipping does add tothe individual price of the product and then it becomes a challenge whether to purchase in the store or on line.<br /><br />I would suggest checking retail pricing on your products and advertise your pricing below retail pricing.

review/summary: Amazing colors, aroma and taste
review/text: I'm a big fan of green tea and I just recently discovered Harney & Sons, Chinese Flower Green Tea.  The smell of the tea sachet (and the tin) is outstanding.  Then when you pour the water over the bag, beautiful colors in the sachet make the experience even more enjoyable.  I'm not usually very effusive about tea, but I feel like drinking this tea is an 'experience' rather than a hot beverage.  The tea tastes as smooth and wonderful as it smells and now I'm not sure I can ever go back to the ho hum stuff I was drinking before! This is the type of tea you make to warm up your body, but then as you drink it you wind up just looking out the window and getting lost in your thoughts.  It's great stuff!

review/summary: Good for teeth AND stress
review/text: CET Chews for Medium Dogs (30 Chews)<br />My dog loves all sizes of these CET Chews. She is a 15 pound Bichon Frise who loves to chew, but only bones, rawhide, or similar chewables. I've heard mixed reviews on rawhide in general, but in the last few years rawhide chews started giving her terribly smelly gas, enough to clear the room! We have discovered, however, that the CET chews do not have that effect, and they help to relieve her stress as well as clean her teeth. We recently switched to the smaller chews because even though she manages the larger chews just fine, we decided it was better to give her smaller ones more often than a big one just occasionally, and that it's probably easier on her small digestive system. Anyway, we love these and would recommend anyone whose dog enjoys chewing to give these a try. Do keep in mind that whenever your pet is chewing something like this that they should be monitored, though we have never had a minute's trouble with these. Thanks!

review/summary: Choking Hazard
review/text: Please be careful with this product. My pug almost died today choking on one of the dog chews. I assume that the larger and smaller ones are fine, but my pug who weighs about 16 lbs (within the 11-25 lb suggestion) could not swallow the chew and got it stuck in her throat (after she chewed it until the point when it got wet and pliable). Thank god that my wife and I were in the living room to witness the accident. My dog fell over in convulsions while choking and my wife physically yanked the chew out of the dog's mouth. I think that this sized chew is very dangerous and you should think twice before purchasing it. If you do have a similar dog and want to buy this product, please supervise him/her!

We have been buying them at the Vet clinic where we take our dog and the price seems to have escalated over the past couple of years. By buying this product on-line we saved almost 50% on the purchase price. Obviously you have to find a seller with free shipping to realize the price advantage.

review/summary: It can be bad
review/text: My dog was on a bland diet (boiled chicken & rice) so his poop was usually solid but a few days after eating 1 it a day, his poop became more liquid-y and green. Not sure if It was actually the cause until I goggled and read on various dog forums about how It have affected other dogs. Stopped giving out my dog It and have thrown them away. Beware; it can be bad, so watch your dog after giving them out.

review/summary: Does this product have an expiration date?
review/text: I have purchased this product from my Vet, however,the vet is a long drive to purchase this item.  The first time I purchased this product from amazon it looked, smelled and felt like the product I had purchased from my vet.  However, this time they smell different, they look and feel different from the product I purchased the first time.  Either they have changed something in the process or these have expired.  My dog still likes them, she has not gotten sick.  So they must be ok.

review/summary: Not what I expected.
review/text: My Vet gave me a little "goodie bad" full of "Vet recommended treats" on our first puppy visit.  A list on the outside of the bag stated the name of each item in the bag and how many of that item.  These "C.E.T. Oral Hygiene Chews" are not the same as the one's in the goodie bag.  Maybe there are different flavors and this are just regular???

review/summary: Opted for a more cost effective route
review/text: I have a 20lb pug and had bought a similar product for medium size dogs. He chewed them up in about 2 min, not very useful for cleaning his teeth. Many people had said that the dog bites off big chunks at a time. SO what i did was bought the bag for Large dogs (same price or may have been a few cents less actually) and i cut them in half. They are a bit thicker so it takes him a long time to chew them up and this way you get TWICE as many. He LOVES them and they don't upset his tummy which is great because almost anything does.

review/summary: Works Well
review/text: I have a 4 year old Westie who weighs about 17 pounds and is a very picky eater.  She will chew these treats a couple of times a week with no complaints and I do believe it has reduced the plaque on her teeth.  I combine these treats with a product called "Triple Pet Plaque Off and Fresh Breath" which is a clear liquid that you add to the water bowl.  In 3 months, she has gone from the vet recommending getting her teeth professionally cleaned to saying that they look great.  It has surely been worth the $20 investment to avoid a costly cleaning and anesthesia. Worth a try!

review/summary: BEWARE, NEVER GIVE TO DOG UNLESS ATTENDED.
review/text: My four legged furry kids love these and they DO help the tartar buildup on their teeth and DO help their bad breath smell better, But both of my dogs also get in a hurry and do not chew into tiny pieces.  They try to hurry up and swallow what is left when the other dog finishes his first, and more than I can count on both hands, the remnants have to be pulled out by a human.  Please do not ever give theses to your dog and leave them unattended.

review/summary: Choking Hazard
review/text: Please be careful with this product. My pug almost died today choking on one of the dog chews. I assume that the larger and smaller ones are fine, but my pug who weighs about 16 lbs (within the 11-25 lb suggestion) could not swallow the chew and got it stuck in her throat (after she chewed it until the point when it got wet and pliable). Thank god that my wife and I were in the living room to witness the accident. My dog fell over in convulsions while choking and my wife physically yanked the chew out of the dog's mouth. I think that this sized chew is very dangerous and you should think twice before purchasing it. If you do have a similar dog and want to buy this product, please supervise him/her!

review/summary: My vet recommended, can't find them cheaper anywhere else.
review/text: About five years ago, we adopted a 6 year old chihauhau/pug/pekinese/guinea pig (just kidding) mix that had terrible teeth.  After having them cleaned by the vet under anesthesia (sp??), the vet recommended we give him this brand of chewies to help keep those expensively-cleaned choppers shiney.<br /><br />I am not sure exactly what is different about these than other brands, but they sure seem to do the trick.  We have had dogs in the past that used cheaper brands of various chewies, and I don't think they actually did much as far as really keeping the teeth clean.  Five years later, this dog's teeth are still nice and tidy and he has not had to have them re-cleaned by the vet.  (And if I remember right, it was almost 300 bucks to have him do it!)<br /><br />Though the dog mentioned could possibly use the smaller chews, we have 2 other dogs (a border terrier mix and a Walker coonhound/retriever mix), and when I get this size, it seems they can all share one bag and do okay.<br /><br />I recommend these if you have a dog with tartar problems specifically, but really, these seem to do a nice job keeping any dogs teeth free of ick!<br /><br />(Side note-- the chihauhau mix that I spoke of used to have seizures now and then-- maybe 5 or 6 a year-- that the vet could not find a cause for.  Since having his teeth cleaned, he has had only 3 seizures in the last 5 years.  I can't say for sure that his dental hygiene played a part in this, but it does seem a strange coincidence!)

review/summary: These work!
review/text: My dog loves these chews.  They work...her teeth are noticeably cleaner.  Unfortunately, my dog is right handed==she only likes to chew on the right side of her mouth--so the teeth on her left side don't look nearly as clean.  I guess this is proof positive that the product is effective.

review/summary: Beef from Mexico, USA, or Canada
review/text: I am always careful to ensure that my dogs don't get treats from China, and since these didn't state the country of origin, I called the company.  I was pleased to hear that they are not from China.<br /><br /> I just ordered them, so I'll update once I get them.  I like the fact that they are healthy for the dogs, not just chew toys.<br /><br />I like their toothbrush and poultry flavored toothpaste very much, and it was recommended by my vet, so these became an obvious choice for me.

review/text: I purchased these chews from my vet and paid $9.00 for 15 chews and these were 30 chews for about $4.00 more. I was told by my vet to only give 1 chew a week and it has helped clean my dog's teeth really good. I'd say that was a great deal!!

review/summary: different dog, same choking problem
review/text: Our pug (different dog than the one in the other review) has been having trouble gagging and vomiting after having these chews, and so I tried soaking one overnight to see if it got soft after ingestion, and it wasn't soft after 12 hours. Which might explain why our small dog has been having so much trouble. No more of these chews in our house.

review/summary: Awesome product. My Dogs LOVE these things
review/text: I used to buy my rawhide a PetSmart. They ran out this time so I looked online and saw this. I bought a bag of this to try out because it has great reviews and the price is reasonable.<br />I got the bag fairly quickly.<br />MOST important thing: my 2 dogs LOVEEEEEE the rawhides. I have a 7pound chihuahua and a 8pound baby beagle. They both LOVE these and prefer these over the PetSmart brand bag I got them.<br />These rawhides don't go as fast too, it takes about 2-3 days for my dogs to finish them so that's good.<br />I bought the Medium size. :)

review/summary: Three Steps to Healthier Teeth
review/text: The C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Dog Chews is one of three steps that have worked well at removing tartar from my dog's teeth. I give her two a day, one in the morning, one at night, and her teeth look better and whiter than before.<br /><br />But remember, these are not a substitute for brushing and rinsing your dog's teeth. Make sure you continue to brush and/or rinse your dog's mouth and teeth after giving your dog a hygiene chew.<br /><br />Other customers have complained that their dogs choke or have a difficult time swallowing the remains of the chew after it has softened. I've experienced this a few times, but my medium-sized dog seems to gain control of the chew after a few wears on it. For the most part, the medium-sized chews are large enough for dogs that weigh between 11 and 25 pounds.<br /><br />Following the three steps to better hygiene (chew, rinse, brush), your dog's teeth will look cleaner, whiter and a whole lot healthier in the weeks and months that follow.<br /><br />T.B. Grant<br />7.8.12
