review/summary: PLEASE, NEVER CHANGE!!
review/text: I've bought Sugar Daddys a number of times over the past years, each time being so  disappointed with the consistency and flavor. When I've called the Tootsie Roll company Customer Service, they've told me there's been no change in the recipe and that they're made the same as always.  Unfortunately, that representative never suggested it might be an issue of FRESHNESS! I ordered a box of 24 suckers in late June 2010 through DAB Nutrition on Amazon, and have been blissfully happy since they arrived.  It is the same rich caramel flavor I remembered.  So, be sure your sucker is fresh or else you'll have a crumbly, poor quality experience!  Arrived quickly as requested. No problems. Thank you!

review/summary: Good for a lonnnnng treat
review/text: I just lost around 50 pounds and was looking for something I could cheat with that wouldn't just vanish in a few bites and satisfy my desire for something sweet and caramely. These weren't as soft as the ones I purchased from my favorite fish camp which were so soft I could eat them like caramel chews but were fresh just the same.  I love the taste and just when I think I will have to indulge in a second one (knowing that would be soooo wrong) I finish it and feel completely satisfied and relieved to be so.  The shipping is not super fast but fast enough.  I'm 60 so these bring back the good ole days when we ate sugar daddy's, sugar babies, black cow, taffy and of course baby ruths.

review/summary: Asta the Westie says, "Five Barks!"
review/text: The Three Muske-Terriers, a male Westie, a male Cesky and the Empress-of-All-She-Surveys, a female Scotty are always on the lookout for tasty, healthy treats, (well, as for healthy, that's really more mom and dad's concern). This can be tricky. The Empress and the Cesky will eat almost anything - but the Empress is also allergic to wheat, corn and soy, (not an uncommon canine problem). As for the Westie, the word "finicky" was coined with Asta in mind. So....<br /><br />The "small breed" version of Natural Balance's Healthy Bones With Turkey, Oatmeal and Cranberry satisfies all three of our terriers. No wheat, corn or soy - instead you get ground oats, barley and rye, turkey and turkey meal, and cranberries, baked with canola oil and preserved with "mixed tocopherols," (this sort'a scary sounding word is just vitamin E sourced from various vegetables). The bones are small, about 3/4's of an inch long. They are all natural - but they're not organic, (if you are interested in organic treats, the Three Muske-Terriers recommend those made by Wagatha or Robbie Dawg).<br /><br />OK, the bones are healthy - how do they taste? Well, without going into why I know this, I think they taste like crunchy "turkey bits" - and the Three Muske-Terriers love 'em. As I said, the Empress and the Cesky are "unreliable" critics, but Asta is a true gourmet - and he gives 'em five barks - I mean stars.

review/text: I was very disappointed in these peanuts.  It almost looks like these were factory seconds where almost every bag had a peanut smashed into the plastic seal.  In some cases this actually ruined the integrity of the packaging. We are planning on using these as wedding favors and aren't sure we can even use them given how disgusting a crushed, salty, soggy nut is when sandwiched in a plastic seal.

review/summary: Duck treats
review/text: When my dog started on allergy shots, I bought a package of duck jerky so that I could give him a treat every time he had a shot (the vet recommended this so my dog would be OK with having his shot).  He seemed to like the jerky but I was running out and saw this brand and decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did - these look like pieces of dried duck and my dog immediately noticed the difference (the other one has uniform pieces of what look like compressed meat).  Very pleased with this product and will order this brand again.

review/text: I eat one of these twice a week before I play ice hockey.  I specifically buy this flavor because it contains caffeine, though I don't perceive any "boost".

It would be nice if the package made a specific recommendation about how long before a workout to eat the Clif Bar.<br /><br />I find the size of a Clif bar a bit disappointing, especially considering the "store" price of $1.50.  At $11 a case and with free shipping when spending $25 or more, I've not found a better price than Amazon's on Clif bars.

review/summary: Not like the old days...
review/text: When I was growing up, every year just after Thanks Giving, our home would be filled with multitudes of boxes from the Swiss Colony. From cheese spreads, meat logs, candies, and most importantly, the petit's fours! I remember Swiss Colony Petit's Fours being much larger, tastier and not dry as stale cake that has been sitting around for months before shipping. I was very disappointed in the flavor and quality of these little cakes and they are not at all the quality I remember growing up. It has been about 14 years since I had anything from the Swiss Colony and I have to say, it will be the last time I order anything from them. There are so many companies out there now that make them bigger, better and fresher (I know, I picked up a box from a famous brand at a local mall kiosk) than what I had when I purchased these. Granted, the price was cheaper...but I guess I got what I paid for. Very disappointed Swiss Colony!

And we always serve The Q's BBQ Sauce - and our friends are always raving about it.  As a matter of fact, this last Christmas I must have given away a couple dozen bottles to friends because they are always asking where they can buy it?  Being available primarily at their BBQ competitions, it can be difficult to find - but not anymore...  There is ONE HUGE factor with this sauce...  It's made with ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS. There are NO artificial ingredients - and there is NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP and NO CORN SYRUP!  They use REAL SUGAR and that's huge.  This shipping is kind of expensive for just one bottle - so buy more than one - you'll be happy you did because you WILL use this stuff on everything...  Other than BBQ it goes great on chicken pizza's and in salads.  Do Not Pass This Up!

review/text: When I went on a weight-loss diet a year ago I cast about for things to eat that wouldn't break the bank calorie-wise. It turns out that the Special K protein meal bar is one of the best for that. A bar contains 180 calories, 10 grams of protein, 5 grams of dietary fiber, no cholesterol, 6 grams total fat with no trans fat. It also contains 20% of your daily requirement for calcium and for iron (based on a 2000 calorie daily diet). Plus it tastes sinfully good. I like this flavor best, but I also like the honey almond protein bar.<br /><br />This is not the only protein meal bar I eat, but it is probably the one I use most often.<br /><br />Scott Morrison

The chocolate peanut butter meal replacement bars are, in my opinion the most satisfying of the 180 calorie bars Special K makes. They are chewy enough that you can enjoy it slowly, and I really feel full after eating one.  I have tried a couple other varieties of the same brand, and although they taste good by diet bar standards, they do not fill me up as well and are not quite as chewy.

review/summary: Love These Special K Bars
review/text: By far, these are the best tasting of the Special K Protein Meal Bars. The chocolate peanut butter bars don't have that weird protein aftertaste and it is almost like eating a candybar. I usually have one for breakfast and it seems to curb the appetite until lunchtime. Great product and great price when using Subscribe and Save.

review/summary: My favorite protein bar
review/text: I've tried many, many protein bars and I have to say, these are my favorite! They are such a yummy little treat and pretty healthy too. I'm slightly disappointed in the number of times I see "Hydrogenated" in the ingredients list, but also acknowledge that it's difficult to make something taste this great with a decent amount of protein (10g) and Fiber (5g). I know it's better to eat some lean meat and good carbs, but that's not always an option, so these are great and convenient. I look forward to eating these after a workout. I've tried bars at the gym, but they are way more expensive and have roughly the same nutrition facts. These a just the right mixture of peanut buttery, chocolaty and crunchy. Consistency is a big thing for me and I don't like bars that taste chewy or chalky, so these are perfect! Good price on Amazon too, I'll be buying these online from now on!

review/summary: Protein Bar for Picky Eaters
review/text: I started purchasing these bars for my young adult son who is a very picky eater. He likes the bars and eats them regularly which means he includes some protein in his diet. Purchasing the bars through the Amazon program ensures that the bars are delivered on a regular basis and at a better price than I can buy them at the grocery store.

review/summary: tasty, satisfying, perfect meal replacement
review/text: I'll admit it--I want it all. I am enough of a foodie to want to eat only good things. And when my schedule or circumstances do not permit a delightful meal or freshly prepared snack--but I need something to keep me going with my kids or work--this is my go-to product. The chocolate tastes like chocolate, the protein does NOT taste or act like some kind of terrible cardboard or sawdust, and the peanut butter is mild and helps carry through a feeling of "I kinda just had a candy bar, but my tum-tum feels like I just ate a big ol' bowl of pasta." For price and convenience, you can't beat the Subscribe and Save price and delivery to your home or office.

review/summary: Great Product, Price OK
review/text: I love Splenda.  I started using it when I began Weight Watchers because it was a simple way to cut points out of my morning cup of tea.  The packets are great, and I love that you can buy them in bulk like this.  However, I only gave this item 4 stars because I took one away for the price.  While it is still cheaper than the price of the small boxes at local grocery stores, if you have a sam's club membership, a box of 1000 packets is only 18.99 plus tax.  If you order it on the website, they will pull the item for you and you can pick it up at the courtesy desk at your local store the next day, no need to go searching.  it may be worth it to check out the other bulk stores as well.

review/summary: Splenda is great
review/text: This is a nice economical pack of Splenda, which is a great sweetener because it tastes just like sugar and since it is made from sugar, it is as close to sugar as you can get without your body metabolizing it (getting calories from it). I purchased it when it was on a Friday Sale. Just be aware that if you are going to cook with it, that it is more potent than sugar (add a lot less than the amount of sugar called for in recipes).

review/summary: Tastes great, less filling, life's good
review/text: I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the after-taste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.<br /><br />My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from. Buy in bulk and save :). 1000-count and 2000-count boxes are available.<br /><br />I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story. I am reaching for the little yellow packets. A box of these lasts me for a long, long time.

review/summary: The Only Sugar Substitute Without The Scary Health Warnings
review/text: I am used to see either the pink (saccharin) or the blue (aspartame) envelope. One warns about cancer while the other one warns about brain damage. Splenda does not have any of those. Now, the pink and the blue are gone from our work office. First approved for use in Canada in 1991 and later on in the US in 1998.<br /><br />Splenda is multiple times sweeter than the previous sugar substitutes. Unlike saccharin, Splenda does not have a metallic aftertaste.<br /><br />Another advantage is that Splenda is stable under heat and can be used for baking.

review/text: I have used this splenda products for the last few years without knowing any side affect.  After reading a few health and diet book, I decided to quit this usage and I threw them away.  Now, I used Stevita Stevia and organic raw blue algave products, they are natural products and good for your health.  They taste great too and highly recommended.  Don't take my word, just google splenda and you will find it out.  I gave this product 2 stars because the taste is fine, but not for your own health.  Give yourself a better health with the above products that I recommended.  Life's too precious!

review/summary: Been using them for years!
review/text: This is one of those products that should be a staple in everyone's closet.  Right beside the Ritz and the Nabisco Premium Saltines.  I LOVE the buttery taste of these crackers and have been using them for about 35 years.  My parents before that always had them in the house. The one thing that can be a challenge is that I don't recommend that you put them in a bowl of canned soup.  The canned soup is usually overly salty anyway and these, well, they're a bit heavy on the salt as well.  If so, be sure to have steady access to water because you'll feel like you just consumed the Dead Sea!  Anyway, these crackers are best served with dips and made into appetizers.  They are quite buttery so if you think that might not work for you, try the Ritz.  They have a bit less butter and have a bit richer flavor.<br /><br />Great product, highly recommend!

review/text: These crackers have a nice texture - crisp and just a little flaky. They are a bit on the salty side and are good paired with creamier cheeses that will cut a little of the salt.<br /><br />The butter taste is a more akin to a margarine flavor which is where this cracker looses points with me. Kind of like if you tried to make a croissant with oil - just not quite what's called for. These would be much better with an authentic butter taste.

review/text: First, let me point out that you should get 2 bottles of this oil and it is NOT "light" olive oil.  It is extra virgin and organic.  The taste is smooth with a bit of peppery finish.  It is certainly a bit pricey so I am not using it as a general cooking oil.  I use it for salads, drizzling on tomatoes and broiling, and if I ate bread, I'd mix this with garlic and herbs and black pepper--YUM!  Hope you enjoy it :)<br />By the way, when I got my order, it only had one bottle and as I bought it thinking it was "light", I was really disappointed.  But the customer service from Baker's Box was excellent.  They let me keep the bottle and refunded my money, since it is not the product as advertised.

review/summary: Purified Water w/ Electrolytes added
review/text: This Arizona bottled water is good tasting purified water.  It also has Electrolytes added to it.  Each bottle is 1 quart in size.  It is promoted as "Vapor Distilled Water" which means it was filtered in a lab to make pure.  The Arizona company is based out of New York, but not sure where they actually get the water from or bottle it.  If the water is from New York, I kind of wonder if the purification really takes out all of the bad things in the water considering the recent news about pharmaceuticals found in tap water.  I guess it all depends on if they filter the water good enough or not.  Perhaps Spring Water is a better alternative depending on the location it comes from.<br /><br />From eHow:<br />Although we know water as having the chemical composition H2O, in reality the water we drink and swim in has a much more complex chemical composition. With plenty of particulates and molecules found in water sources we encounter everyday, pure H2O is quite scarce. Vapor distilled water is created in a lab that filters out all the excess material and is much purer than the water typically found in nature.

review/summary: Quite good for commercial grade, but the price is insane
review/text: I've raised many a healthy kitten on Purina's Kitten Chow (pre-Nesley acquisition) and same applies to the Complete version of their dry food. The price with shipping is so high, I'm wondering if this is some horrible hallucination. I guess whatever a person like myself could have saved on gasoline is more than offset by the price you're asking.<br /><br />Ah, well. It's like this: y'all put the prices into the Ionosphere and I'll just get sensible and make my own dry cat food. The advantages are more than monetary as I don't have to sweat recalls and such. Nestle, being associated with chocolate, well.. it's a bit toxic for cats and dogs, isn't it.<br /><br />Nice of you to carry this, though and charge six bucks for shipping so people with busloads of money to burn can acquire it at their convenience.

review/text: This tea is just OK. It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't taste any better than Luzianne or Lipton. And, unlike Luzianne, it's cloudy which I really don't like to see in a clear pitcher and glass. I would be embarrassed to serve this to guests. I've made it according to the enclosed "moon brewing" directions and also in my iced tea maker. It's cloudy both ways. Also, these tea bags make a gallon of tea each so unless you like really strong tea, they're too big for a 3-quart iced tea maker unless you dilute it after you brew. I'm disappointed and won't order this flavor or this brand again.

review/text: My family and I use this dry mix to make dressing for salads, chicken tenders and a host of other dishes.  Around where I live, a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing is about 1.50, sometimes more depending on what store you go in and how desperately you need it.  This is the best deal I have found to buy this product in bulk.  This mix is good for a host of things, including fresh roasted potatoes.  Just wash and cut potatoes any way you like, put in a bag with a little vegetable or olive oil and as much of the dry mix for flavor as you like, toss, put into a glass dish or on a pan.  Put into 350-375 degree oven and cook until done. You have a simple side to go with dinner.  Onions are also a good addition to this dish.<br /><br />I will continue to buy this product from Amazon.com as long as they offer it.  Now, if I could only find my favorite chili mix...

review/text: I purchased a three-pack of this seasoning from Amazon, thinking that I could recreate the taste of the commercial bags of white cheddar popcorn I buy at the super market. Unfortunately, this product tastes nothing like the white cheddar seasoning I was looking for. There is very little cheese flavor evident. The taste is more like a seasoned salt (Lawry's or McCormick, for example). I could taste a hint of celery salt and paprika, but not cheddar cheese. So I am stuck with three jars of seasoned salt. Maybe I will try it on a salad. I don't know why they formulated this stuff the way they did, but to me it is not worth the substantial sodium intake.

review/text: I love the Dinty Moore Potatoes and Ham and I hope that they continue to offer it. I've tried to find it locally but I can only find it at some local drugstores who only get small quantities at a time.  I guess it isn't a best seller so that might be why it's so hard to find but I love potatoes and I had to try it. I like the potatoes and ham more than any of the other Dinty Moore bowl products.  I order a case all the time from Amazon.  I've made this from scratch but everything always taste better homemade. The small bowls are just rIght for me if I want just a little something late at night and don't want a whole sandwich and don't want to cook something.  I just microwave and stir. I had to start ordering the larger size too since my husband likes the potato and ham and he's a picky eater and doesn't like food from a can. I have to admit It didn't look appealing to him but once he tried a spoonful of mine I can't keep it in the house.

review/summary: Started off fine, made me nauseous afterwards
review/text: While I like Dinty Moore's beef stew, it seems that this is just one product of theirs that I just don't like.<br /><br />The food isn't that appealing- the food was all pale & pasty looking, but looks can be deceiving when it comes to food, so I went ahead & got it anyway. C'mon... ham & potatoes! How can that be ruined?<br /><br />I unfortunately got my answer- you ruin it by loading it up with tons & tons of grease. The first few bites of this weren't bad & I think that if I only had a small portion of it, it wouldn't be such a terrible thing. (Hence the 2 stars rather than 1 star.) I managed to struggle through the bowl (I hate wasting food & had nothing else to eat), but shortly afterwards I just felt sick to my stomach.<br /><br />If you have either a cast iron stomach or you REALLY like food like this, then you'll probably like it. Me? This is just one DM product I'll never be buying again!!
