review/summary: It tastes like watered down fruit punch... no thanks. Not my thing.
review/text: I'm not one of those guys that likes fresh lemon in my ice water, to me it tastes like watered down lemonade but many people I know like the slight hint of lemon. This fruit punch is a bit stronger then the watered down lemon taste, but it's not that much stronger. It does turn your drink red, it does have a bit of a taste but frankly it's not enough of a taste for me to go for it. I would rather drink plain water then this flavoring.<br /><br />Other reasons why I don't like it, the bottle is pretty large, and once you open it you need to keep it refrigerated. This means I can't leave it in my desk at work and pop it in my water bottles as I open a new one. That eliminates the convenience factor. If I am going to refrigerate it I might as well make a full pitcher of a drink.<br /><br />The flavor, size of this and lack of portability due to the need to refrigerate this means I won't be using it anymore. There are a number of other products that don't require the refrigeration, are smaller and have a stronger taste and I'll stick with those.

review/summary: Okay Flavoring, Didn't Feel any Energy Boost
review/text: For me this wasn't the best flavoring, but it doesn't taste bad.  It didn't really taste like Fruit Punch to me, though.  I really like the Crystal Light fruit punch, or even the store brand versions of it, and this had a really "off" taste.  It says one squirt, and at first I used a pretty generous squirt to my bottled water, but I had to add to it two more times after that to get the flavor right.  I don't know if its because it's "healthy" or "sugar-free", because Crystal Light isn't too bad for you either, and again, tastes great to me; but the flavor on this was just way off for me.  Maybe if I tried Cherry as someone else recommended, that might be better.  I like Cherry so I might like that more.  There isn't a bad after-taste or anything like that, so I would definitly be willing to try that.  In the meantime, with this flavor, however, it doesn't appeal to me and I have a feeling my 6 and 13 year olds will be finishing it off.  Not that I'd want them having "energy" drinks, but I didn't get any kind of boost out of this and it does seem pretty healthy.  We don't buy koolaid or let them have pop except special occassions, pizza nights, stuff like that anyways, so this seems like a decent alternative to koolaid and they really like crystal light too.  I don't think they will mind the taste as much as I do, I am definitly a bit pickier and spoiled in my 32 years!  It was okay though and wouldn't mind trying another flavor but wouldn't really recommend the fruit punch.  There's better stuff out there tastewise for cheaper and again, there's not really an energy kick to this.

review/summary: Just okay....
review/text: I generally like the taste of fruit punch, but this tastes watered down, even if I add an extra squeeze of it to my drinking glass.  The product concept is good, and I like the added caffeine and vitamins.  But the taste of the drink needs to be a little stronger.  Of course, I can add an extra squeeze of the product, but them I am also getting extra caffeine which is not always a good thing.<br /><br />I was surprised at the size of the bottle, because I was expecting a very small bottle like the similar Mio product uses.  This is definitely too large to carry around in my purse.  At any rate, it is recommended to refrigerate it after opening, so I will continue to carry Crystal Light packets in my purse.

review/summary: Not a Fan
review/text: After drinking this, I was torn on what i thought about it but the kicker was the taste. I've never been a huge fan of fruit Punch and this reminds me of any drink that has that title. It tastes exactly the same as everything else. To make me want to squeeze something into my water and go that extra mile, I want to have something beautiful at the end of the rainbow. Fruit Punch - not exactly a pot of gold.<br /><br />As for claims of being good for you, the label does say its so but my testing kit was at the cleaners so I'm not really sure. I suppose it is like anything else; you can take the bottle at value and hope for the best but, in the end, like the way it tastes as well.<br /><br />One last thing on this is the amount you should pore. When it says to add a squeeze, i'm not exactly sure what that is. I added, sipped, added, sipped some more, trying to get my amount. Personally, I would have liked a spoon comparison or something. I thought this was perhaps odd, and then someone else at my home asked me the same thing on it - and said they liked the Fruit Punch, did I get it from an infomercial.<br /><br />Go figure.

review/summary: It's useful for helping you transition to pure water
review/text: If you want to be super healthy, you should only drink pure water. (Some doctors say a bit of green tea and one glass of red wine per day is also good.) All other beverages are less healthy than water.<br /><br />If you're used to drinking sweet drinks, then this product can help you transition to drinking pure water. Start by adding the recommended serving size (one full squeeze), then slowly wean yourself off of it by doing half squeezes or less. Eventually, you won't need it all.<br /><br />The taste is OK. It has that typical artificial sweetener taste. Still, at least it's more healthy than most sweet drinks.<br /><br />Try it and then slowly move to plain water.

review/summary: The kids love it but still prefer Mio
review/text: My sons (11 +7) hate drinking water no matter how much I insist that they do. I've given them all the excuses I could come up some true and others made up just to get them to drink it. Of course their excuse was "water has no flavor" or "it doesn't taste good", so when Mio first came on the market I thought that might be something to try, something to enhance the flavor and get them drinking. Unfortunately when I'm not around Mio tends to become the "new juice mix". Although I don't mind the enhancement of water to encourage kids to drink I'd still prefer them to drink regular plain water.<br /><br />When Vine offered this product for review, the first thing that caught my eye was "Vitamin". Well why not give this a try. I was impressed. Since this one required just one squeeze I emphasized that my 11yr old would be the one doing the squeeze and that's all they were going to get. Well after their first squeeze the kids declared that it actually tasted good. Not as great a Mio but good enough.<br /><br />My issues with this is that I would have much preferred to have them tell me 1tsp/1tbsp etc instead of a squeeze. Not everyone squeeze the same. The other issue is that it does require refrigeration and because of its size it's not portable unlike Mio which I can stick in my purse and take to the park.<br /><br />I haven't checked out the other flavors but will stick with Mio because of the ultra portability and the ability to get a vast assortment of flavors without having to buy a pack of 4 from Amazon of this product.

review/summary: Instant energy drink
review/text: There are already tons of products that are called water enhancers.  Most of them is just flavoring, sort of a Kool-Aid squirt potion bottles.  This one added vitamins, caffeine and taurine, which converts your plain water into  an instant energy drink.<br /><br />For comparison, you would need approximately three squeezes to match the amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee.<br /><br />If only they can improve the taste to match the most popular soft drink mixes in the market.  There is also a slight metallic aftertaste.

review/summary: Seemed like a great idea...but...
review/text: This sounded like a great idea, especially for people who like expensive vitamin water that comes pre-bottled. This is a greener way to get the same flavor and vitamin benefit with a reusable bottle. This would be great, except I didn't like it all that much. It was just okay.<br /><br />It was hard to measure "a squeeze". The bottle has markings, but since it's gray, you can't see how much you've used. Plus, every time you squeeze, it's a little different. The first cup I tried, I squeezed some in without measuring. It seemed a little weak. Then, I measured 8 oz. water and 1 tablespoon (the .5 oz serving listed on the bottle) of the Energy drink. This produced a stronger tasting and much sweeter tasting outcome. But, that was a little strong on the vitamin taste.<br /><br />The fruit punch flavor isn't horrible, but the sugar substitute and the vitamins leave an after taste. It reminds me a little of chewable children's aspirin or cold tablets. Not really what I was hoping for.<br /><br />I know there are some people who will like this because they like other vitamin waters. It really isn't all that different from the bottled vitamin water. I just don't happen to like that all that much either.

review/summary: Serving size  = 1 tbsp.; Shake well before use; 0 calories
review/text: When I get bored with ice tea and coffee, I will usually opt for a fruit flavored powdered mix packet that I add to ice water. Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink Fruit Punch isn't overly sweet & is similar in flavor to the powdered drinks, but  also contains added vitamins, minerals & caffeine.  However, I have a hard time getting the correct amount without measuring it.  The serving/squeeze  equals one tbsp  or 3 tsp  for 8oz of water.<br /><br />Each serving of Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink provides vitamins C, B3, B5, B6, B12, Chromium, Zinc, Taurine, Electrolytes & 40 mg of caffeine. I felt a slight energy boost when I drank a couple servings during my midday slump.<br /><br />For best quality refrigerate & use within 30 days after opening. Shake well before each use.

review/text: Great option of being able to simply add it to water. You can adjust it to your taste weather you want a stronger or weaker taste. The taste is good if you like fruit punch, it doesn't have a very overwelming taste. I usually like a stronger tast and even adding a little more, it was not to sweet or overwhelmingly strong. I like the fact that as you make it a bit stronger, you don't have to worry about it getting really sweet.

review/summary: Tastes a bit like Kool-Aid
review/text: This is a vitamin-containing flavor enhancer for water.  You squeeze this into your water (one squeeze for 8 oz of water).  This gives you some flavor, a bunch of vitamins, and some caffeine.  The flavor of this was reminiscent of Kool-Aid.  For a drink that is supposed to be full of health benefits, this contained an awful lot of artificial colors.  I found this a bit too sweet and a bit too artificial.

review/summary: It's good, not great
review/text: The flavor of this drink is good when you mix it with water. It pretty much has that typical fruit punch flavor. The only thing is that I didn't know how much I should really add. At first I just squirted it once or twice into about 17 ounces of water, and the flavor was too light. Then I just kept squirting more and I ended up having to add more water because it was so sweet and had an strange aftertaste. Once you get the combo right it tastes pretty good, and if you mix it into cold water then the aftertaste is not nearly as obvious.

review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink - Fruit Punch comes in a convenient 12 oz squeeze bottle so that you can take it wherever you go and give your water and extra kick of flavor and vitamins. I absolutely love this product. It's a great alternative for juice lovers, and flavored water lovers who don't want to sacrifice flavor for extra calories. Also children love it as well, my daughter drinks 5x more water now since I've got the Fruit Punch flavor.<br /><br />The Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink - Fruit Punch measure as one squeeze per every 8 oz of water, however no matter how much you squeeze into your glass (if you prefer the flavor to be slightly stronger) it will always be ZERO calories and full of vitamin C, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, calcium, potassium,  vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B6 & vitamin B12.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to everyone who loves juice, flavored water, or just wants a Zero calorie drink with lots of flavor.

review/text: Although fruit punch isn't my favorite flavor, I like the idea of adding some flavor, vitamins and little caffeine to make plain water or seltzer more interesting. It adds enough sweetness without being to sweet and you can adjust the intensity of the flavor by how many squeezes you add. Everyone else I let try this liked it as well. I will probably get it again, just a different flavor.

review/summary: Good idea, but ingredients differ from what the Amazon web page says
review/text: This appeared to me to be an ideal product--providing a little bit of fruit flavor and also vitamin C to water--a variant on my habit of adding a little juice to drinking water (which does encourage more drinking, a good thing particularly in the summertime).  Unfortunately, the ingredients on the bottle I received differ from what's listed on the Amazon web page, and include taurine, which is animal-derived.<br />If you are not a vegetarian you still may wish to try this, based on the other reviews.  You may wish to measure the product since, as others observe, a "squeeze" can be more or less generous.

review/summary: An Odd Flavor -- Different Everytime, Too
review/text: There's this neat looking scale on the side of the bottle that looks like it is your way of telling how much to put in each drink, but there are three problems:<br /><br />1) The bottle is irregularly shaped, so each unit is a different size depending on how wide the bottle is at that point,<br />2) When you squeeze the bottle, you distort it so the level rises instead of falls upon dispensing, and (most importantly)<br />3) The label is opaque, so you can't see the fluid level anyway!<br /><br />So I have no idea how much a "squeeze" is supposed to be. My squeeze is probably different from your squeeze. Heck, my morning squeeze is different from my afternoon squeeze. So each time I use this, I get a different, indeterminate amount. Who knows how much of the vitamins I'm getting!<br /><br />And what's worse is the flavor is a little different every time. Sometimes it tastes exactly like Pepto-Bismol, and other times it tastes like a flat fruit drink box. But it always leaves me with cotton-mouth from its over-use of chemical sweeteners.<br /><br />But despite all that I still gave it two stars because it is more tolerable than some other similar products that I've tried.<br /><br />This is a fad product at best. I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't even available in a year or two.

review/summary: I like the taste, but it feels heavy on caffeine
review/text: I think the flavor of this product is close to Kool-Aid, which depending on your point of view may be good or bad.  I actually liked the fruit punch flavor- definitely old school after all the new flavor combinations companies come up with these days.  I drank it both watery and strong, and when drinking it strong, it feels like it has a lot of caffeine.  Initially, I felt a little jittery, but it passed quickly.  I don't know if it's necessarily high in caffeine (since it's hard to judge how much actually goes into a glass of water), but I definitely felt it.  It may be the combination of the caffeine and Vitamin C.  To me, it falls somewhere between drinking a Red Bull (not too strong) to Monster (very strong).  Still, it's a decent product and I would buy it again.

review/summary: Interesting but flawed energy drink concept.
review/text: Energy drinks are a multi-billion dollar industry.  More and more companies are trying to cash in on this growing consumer market.  Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is worth a try.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>Each serving of 1/2oz concentrate is mixed with 8oz of water to provide 120% of Recommended Daily Value (RDV) of Vitamin C (plus various Vitamin B complexes, taurine (10mg), electrolytes: Zinc, Magnesium, and Chromium in lower % RDV).<br />>Fairly easy to use with snap open cap.<br />>0g Fat and sodium<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />>Bulky 12oz bottle not suitable for carrying around throughout the day to add to drinks.<br />>Relies on 40mg of "natural caffeine" without any carbs and proteins to provide energy.<br />>Not particularly tasty even though it has "all natural flavors". Taste is highly subjective.<br />>Not suitable as a sports drink due to lack of carbs and proteins for muscles.<br />>Artificial Red 40 food coloring.<br />>Inconsistent squeezes means not always 1/2oz (15ml) of concentrate dispensed each time.<br />>$5.98 for each 12oz. bottle that provides 24 ($.25) servings when mixed with 8oz. of water.  Not cost effective.<br />>Not an essential drink for those who already take daily vitamin supplements or prefer other energy drinks not based on caffeine.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Nondescript and indistinct beverage concentrate that may not compete strongly in any particular Energy Drink niche: Not enough caffeine to compete with heavy hitters such as Monster Energy or Red Bull; No carbs and proteins to compete with top Sports drinks such as Gatorade and Powerade.  My family still prefers the classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LTIKUW">Calpico Concentrated Drink Mix, 16.9-Ounce</a> which tastes much better as a casual beverage.

review/summary: Lots of color but taste was a little disappointing
review/text: This Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is supposed to taste like fruit punch, but I didn't taste any fruit that I could recognize.  It's kind of a nondescript blend that has what I would describe as a "generic" flavor.  With so many good flavors available today I would have liked to see a product that had fruit flavors that I could actually pick out in the blend, like home made punch.  It didn't have an aftertaste, which is a positive. I like that there are 0 calories per serving.  A serving is 1/2 ounce according to their label and there are 24 servings to the container.  It's hard to say what a "squeeze" is or how much you're going to squeeze out each time.  It varies for me.  Sometimes the drink would be too weak, other times, just right. I added it to water in a sports drink bottle and it was convenient to drink it that way.  Adding ice improves the taste.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed as: Water, citric acid, vitamin C, natural flavor, sucralose, natural caffeine, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, magnesium lactate, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, calcium lactate, potassium phosphate, vitamin A, palmitate, vitamin E, vitamin B6, vitamin B12.  I'm not sure if it's the caffeine or the added vitamins that give me the energy after drinking it, but I do feel a little bit energized after a couple glasses. (I guess it could also be the power of suggestion.) The color is a bright pinkish red.  It looks like the color would stain my hands or the counter top if spilled, but so far it hasn't.  I plan on finishing the bottle but I probably will not purchase again.

As for the vitamins its infused with, I guess they can't hurt, but don't confuse Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink as something healthy. It's a zero calorie, zero carb beverage, that is sweetened with Sucralose. They also added some caffeine and vitamins, but it's probably more for marketing than anything else. If you're a fan of diet soft drinks, you'll probably like Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink. If you don't like sugar free soft drinks, then definitely look elsewhere.

However, I have not noticed the promised energy burst after finishing my vitamin drink.<br /><br />If you typically use products that you add to water, Vitamin Squeeze is a product to try.  The fruit punch flavor tastes fruity but does have a hint of sucralose.  I prefer Vitamin Squeeze over the MIO products.

review/summary: YES! --Finally a drink additive that I actually like + vitamins!!
review/text: I HATE plain water... But of course ..."It is good for you and yada yada yada.." and yeah you do get tired of soda, beer etc..<br />So I have tried a lot of things, like the preloaded powders, flavored water, and now new ones like this one that are liquid and you squirt in. To be honest, this is the FIRST one that I liked! I had a plain old filtered water.. not spring.. just plain old filtered water, filled a 16 oz bottle, and put 2 squirts into it, shook and .. yeah I was like "FINALLY this is pretty good"!<br /><br />On the side it says "1 squeeze for 8oz of water, each squeeze into water adds more flavor and nutrition.<br />Super Concentrated Always Dilute... makes 24 servings"<br />It also recommends:<br />"For best quality to store in fridge, and use within 30 days after opening. Shake Well before each use"<br /><br />So I am totally happy.. it taste good, but what is even better is actually has some vitamins in it, Caffeine, Taurine and electrolytes.. oh... 0 calories, 0 Sugar and 0 Carbs!!<br /><br />Ok.. the breakdown .. from the label:<br />One serving is 1/2 fl. oz (15ml) = about 24 per container.<br />Amounts per serving:<br />0 calories, 0 Sugar and 0 Carbs 0 Sodium, 0 Protein<br />Vitamins:<br />C 140%<br />B3, B5, B6 and B12 40% each<br />Zinc 10%<br />Chromium 10%<br />"Not a significant source of Saturated Fat, trans fat, cholesterol, potassium,<br />dietary fiber, calcium, iron, phosphorous and magnesium"<br />Percent Daily Values based on a 2,000 calorie diet.<br /><br />In case you are wondering, I believe the sweetener is Sucralose, it is on the label fifth after Water, Citric Acid,<br />Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) and Natural Flavor. If you need more of the ingredients just let me know, I will get my magnifying glass out :)<br /><br />ANYWAY.. I like it! no more plain water!<br />Jim

review/summary: Is this a health drink or a kids drink?
review/text: If people bought "energy" drinks solely on the basis of taste, the market for these products would shrink pretty quickly because most of these drinks have no definable taste profile and mostly taste like diluted Kook-aid. Fortunately for companies like the aptly named Vitamin Squeeze, buyers have been so conditioned by the giant beverage companies (e.g., Gatorade, Coke, Pepsi, etc.) to accept gawdawful concoctions falsely marketed as "flavors" that what the product actually tastes like is of little or no concern when the purchase decision is made.<br /><br />It's hard to tell what the makers of "Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink" want you to think of their product. The product description suggests this is an energy/vitamin drink that will enhance your health. The packaging and flavor descriptions (e.g., "fruit punch") suggest this stuff is a kids' drink along the lines of Kool-aid injected with a jolt of caffiene.<br /><br />I tried to ignore the marketing buzzwords completely and focus on the taste and the convenience factor. In terms of taste, if you ignore the flavor listed on the label, you'll have a tough time describing what this product actually tastes like. It's definitely not fruit, and it doesn't taste like any punch I'd consume. I'd say it tastes kind of sweet and mostly artificial. It's drinkable, as long as your expectations are very low and you're OK with a drink that is red and sweet and not much more.<br /><br />The packaging is pretty cool, though, and portioning is easy - which is why a product like this exists. Just fill an empty bottle with water, squeeze in a little concentrate, shake, and you've got a cheap energy drink in seconds.<br /><br />If Vitamin Squeeze can produce a drink that tastes like something grown, not manufactured, I'd have this stuff stacked to the ceiling in my pantry. Until then, I'll pass.

review/summary: For active adults, better choice than Mio
review/text: This was my first time to try "Vitamin Squeeze" brand water enhancer, although I am very familiar with the similar Mio brand that's been on the market for quite a while.  Even though I knew that this container would be 12-ounces, I was still amazed when I opened the box to discover how truly large this bottle was compared to Mio water enhancer.  The Vitamin Squeeze bottle is about three times larger than a Mio bottle, although it actually holds 12-ounces as opposed to Mio's 1.6-ounce.  But please note that they actually offer the exact same number of servings (24).  Mio is concentrated, while Vitamin Squeeze is not -- as was clearly stated on the package.  As far as taste, quality, and appearance was concerned, I don't think the lack of concentration made any difference.  It's also worth noting that Vitamin Squeeze should be kept in the fridge, unlike Mio which I store in my pantry.  This might be a serious issue for those interested in carrying a bottle around in a purse or gym bag, in addition to its unwieldy size.<br /><br />I received one bottle of the Fruit Punch flavor to try out, and I decided to compare it directly with the Mio version of Fruit Punch to provide a more accurate review.  Mio's punch is a bright, rich -- almost unnatural -- red, like Kool Aid, and it tastes like it too.  Vitamin Squeeze delivers a more subtle pink-orange colored beverage, and the taste is very different.  It is not overly sweet, like Mio.  In fact, my first impression was that it tasted more like the fruit punch flavor of Gatorade I drank years ago when I was in high school.  I tried the Vitamin Squeeze at different times of the day.  It was not a very pleasant drink first thing in the morning, though it was actually quite refreshing -- more so than the sticky sweetness of Mio -- after a morning workout.  I tried to drink it with a meal but quickly gave up.  I'd rather enjoy water or soda.  This "fruit punch" stands on its own and didn't see to go well with food of any kind.  Finally, I let my four-year-old daughter try it for the ultimate test.  She's a big fan of Mio, which she calls "magic fruit punch," and often uses it at dinner to flavor her water.  She disliked Vitamin Squeeze and would only drink one sip, which she dismissed as unsweet and yucky.<br /><br />My conclusion is that, while Mio's Kool Aid-type punch is great for kids, Vitamin Squeeze is probably a better choice for active adults, especially since it does provide a few vitamins (nothing much beyond your typical 100% Vitamin C) and tastes great and not too sweet after a workout.  The 12-ounce bottle is a bit clunky, needs to be stored in the frige, and you really have to squeeze a couple of generous full-bottle squirts into your water bottle to get a real taste of the product.  I have my doubts that my bottle will make it all the way to a full 24 servings, and I stopped keeping track after about six or so.  Given the choice, I think I would choose Vitamin Squeeze over Mio.

review/summary: Tastes good and works also with milk...I'm sold on it
review/text: For once, we reviewers get enough of a food product to really test it and write up a fair review.  It works great with water, but I tried it with milk and it truly enhances that product also...it even blends well with chocolate milk and produces a good flavor.  I also tried it with coffee...the result was interesting, but I'll stick with using it with water and milk.<br /><br />It also seems to me that my energy level is a bit higher during the week that I've been using this.  I'm 79 and am tired more often than I should be...the past week, I've noticed that I've been noticeably less tired, so I am sold on this product.<br /><br />The one criticism is that a "squeeze" is an indeterminate amount and I don't always get quite the right amount.  I still recommend this.

review/summary: Yuck!!! Qustionable benefits and tough to dispense
review/text: I did not like this product for three reasons:<br /><br />1) Taste - putting everything else aside, this stuff tastes terrible.  It is fruit punch flavored, and I generally don't mind fruit punch.  But, this is really very fruity and reminded me of those horrible sugar drinks we used to drink as a kid.  I really found the taste hard to get past.<br /><br />2) Dispenser - the product makes a big deal about the one squeeze per 8oz of water (a standard side water bottle).  It didn't work because there is no indication how big a squeeze to give.  I was expecting something like is found on Act mouthwash.  One squeeze could be a couple of drops or most of the bottle.  There is also no way to see how much is left in the bottle because of the opaque wrapper.<br /><br />3) Questionable benefits - The label says this stuff adds vitamins C, B3, B5, B6 and B12, caffeine, taurine and electrolytes.  It gives odd measures of each benefit - sometimes as a % (presumably of RDA) and sometimes as mg.  For electrolytes it says it has two lightningbolts worth.  Most of this stuff you can get easily elsewhere from a normal diet.  Taurine has been proven to be of no established benfit.  Caffeine? Well, I can't really comment on why you would want that in an energy drink.  Many of these "benefits" are also not clearly placed in an energy drink or a recovery drink.  I have absolutely no idea how many electrolytes are contained in two lightningbolts.  It is not a measure I am familiar with.<br /><br />Two stars, not one, because it did not make me sick or anything.

review/summary: It's got electrolytes
review/text: Or so the bottle wrapping claims and there's more: Vitamins C, B3, B5, B6, B12 plus 'natural' caffeine and... Taurine. I didn't know what 'Taurine' was so I looked it up. Well, whatever it is, according to Wikipedia, "a review published in 2008 found no documented reports of negative or positive health effects associated with the amount of taurine used in energy drinks" so it probably doesn't hurt to have some.<br /><br />The end product, after squeezing the concentrate into a glass of water is that the water color changes to orangy-red and it acquires a vaguely fruity synthetic smell and flavor and, according to the wrapping, it gets 120% of your daily Vitamin C needs.<br /><br />To answer the question: 'after my first glass, would I have another one?' I must admit that I wasn't able to actually finish my first glass. I wouldn't call it 'bad tasting' but I'd rather have my drinking water clean and maybe some fruit on the side or some mostly natural fruit juice to fulfill may daily requirements of Taurine, Vitamin C, Sodium Benzoate and the ever-essential electrolytes.

review/summary: Tasty...vitamins aside, it's making me drink more water
review/text: Very glad I read the label...when I selected it from Amazon I thought it was an energy drink...it's actually an additive you put in your water to make your water an energy drink!<br /><br />Actually very tasty...very reminiscent of Kool-Aid Fruit Punch flavor.  One long squeeze is good for me in a 1/2 liter bottle of water.  I do like that you can make it stronger or weaker to taste based on how much you add.<br /><br />Needs to be refrigerated after opening...one more thing to take up space in my fridge, but oh well.<br /><br />I notice I'm drinking more water later thanks to this, so that's good!<br /><br />And if I'm getting more vitamins, well hey, that's cool too.  0 calories...has caffeine.

You may want to take a good look at the nutrition label (carbs and sat fat), but I like that there are no fake flavors in it. Sodum Bicarbonate is the only chemical. A few (small handful) is plenty to meet those carb cravings, and the dark chocolate is a nice addition. Did not get the usual reactions my body makes to chocolate, which is a good thing.

review/text: This is pretty good stuff, especially if you enjoy chocolate covered raisins, nuts, and such. I, myself, am not a fan of raisins because of their texture, and I find that this product is similar in taste to raisins with none of that gooey chewiness that I dislike. I suppose that's because it's made with fruit juices (blueberry, a�ai, raspberry, cranberry, elderberry, and more!) rather than dried pieces of fruit, and a tasty chocolate coating.

review/text: I first bought this product about 6 years ago when I just started to get interested in Thai cooking.  I thought that it would be easier than making it from scratch (which is what I prefer to do now) and it is.  Very authentic flavor but the Jasmine rice tastes more like regular long grain rice to me.  The spices are fairly mild but can be adjusted.  Here is how I make it:<br /><br />*  I substitute <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CN7BMA">Coconut Water</a> for the water -- it still gives a nice flavor but the rice stays a nice, fluffy consistency compared to using coconut milk.<br /><br />*  I add a few diced, red Serrano peppers before I boil the coconut water.<br /><br />*  I added minced red and yellow bell peppers to the mix before boiling.<br /><br />*  I finish off with some chopped Thai basil as a garnish.<br /><br />Again, it is a nice mix which can become even nicer if you mess around with it a little.

review/summary: A+++Dog Food/Shipping Quality C-
review/text: Although Blue Buffalo dog food is a wonderful product and our almost ten year-old gal loves it, I hesitate to make another purchase from Amazon due to the number of dented cans that were in this shipment, and in a previous order. I contacted Blue Buffalo directly this time because the case product was shrink wrapped and then packed in a carton for shipment. I thought this meant the dented cans were most likely packaged by Blue Buffalo. However, their customer service assured me they have strict quality control on their products before they leave the factory, and no dented products would be allowed through. They suggested the damage happened somewhere else in the distribution line, and they did not offer any restitution other than a coupon for three cans. I probably should have contacted Amazon again (I had complained about a prior shipment and received a partial refund.), but foolishly did not -- my loss. These experiences, however, have made me wary of ordering canned dog food despite the luxury of free shipping and door delivery.

review/summary: Balance of Sweet, Tart and a Hint of Spice
review/text: Alpine Spiced Cider is a great instant cider blend. Many quick, powdered drinks are one-note, but this one isn't. It manages to be both sweet and tart like real apple cider, and has just a hint of cinnamon and mulled spice in the background. During long, cold winters, it's so nice to have a fast treat like this cider to help warm you up inside.<br /><br />Because these have a good amount of Vitamin C, they are also excellent for the inevitable winter colds. On those horrible days when even opening and heating a can of chicken soup seems too hard, all you have to do is switch your electric kettle to on, dump the packet into a cup and you're good to go. Maybe a cup of apple cider a day can even keep the doctor away, who knows?<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the Alpine Spiced Cider Drink Mixes as a quick and easy way to enjoy a hot beverage. It won't be as authentic as homemade cider, but it won't be a hassle to prepare either.<br /><br />Note: You can find these at national chain warehouse stores for a reasonable price, but because they're usually considered a seasonal item, you'll have the best luck (and find the best deals) during fall and winter.

I always find myself going back to Alpine's cider packets. My whole family loves them. My husband, who usually sticks with coffee, drinks a cup every night before bed, and my 4 year old would drink this all day if I let him. If you like cider and have never tried this stuff, then I absolutely recommend it. I'm so glad I can purchase such a large quantity here at Amazon.

review/summary: Tasty Japanese candies
review/text: I picked up this tiny 5-pack candy sampler during a layover in Hong Kong a couple months ago. I had my doubts, since candy I've tried in other countries has often disappointed me for lack of flavor or quality. But it was cheap, and I was curious!<br /><br />Well, these little candies did not disappoint me at all. Four of the five candies were very unique to me, unlike any I've tried at home or in other countries. From left to right, here is a description of each:<br /><br />1. These hard candy-coated discs are like a cross between M&Ms and Skittles, and the inside is strawberry flavored. They taste fruity, somewhat like a Skittle, but are not chewy.<br />2. These coffee-flavored candies are shaped like a coffee bean but do not have a coffee bean inside. They taste like sweetened coffee with no bad aftertaste. I liked these a lot.<br />3. You wouldn't think these tiny chocolate pellets would be so flavorful, but they really are quite chocolaty. The texture is firm like a chocolate bar but not crunchy. Some have a pale yellow star painted on the end.<br />4. Shaped a little like a pyramid, these candies taste like a strawberry milkshake and are chocolate dipped on one end. Very smooth flavor. My husband thought these were terrific.<br />5. These reminded me of M&Ms or Canada's Smarties. They are hard candy-coated discs with chocolate inside. Very good, though not original...<br /><br />If you feel like spending the money to try them, they won't disappoint you. However, if you have a chance to buy them in Japan, they're less than a dollar a package!

review/summary: The Real Deal on Flavacol
review/text: First let me say, this stuff is the secret behind movie theatre popcorn. It is SO good. It's mostly salt, but some flavorings and colors.<br /><br />To get movie theatre style popcorn, you must pop in hot coconut oil with this mixed in. Then use a buttery topping and sprinkle a little more of this one top. That's literally the 'recipe" & it is delicious.<br /><br />Coconut oil is ideal, but sometimes I use canola oil, because it's cheaper and I have it on hand.<br /><br />Another cheat I use is turning this into "microwave" popcorn... since I don't want to clean a stove top popper. Mix your oil and flavorings in a small bowl, stir in unpopped kernels around a couple tablespoons. Place a brown paper lunch sack on a plate and dump in the kernel mixture. Roll the top over on itself a bit. Microwave on the plate. Obviously times will vary, but mine takes about 90 seconds. Viola.<br /><br />It seems a little pricey by the time you pay for shipping, but bear in mind each of these containers has 992 servings in it. Imagine a milk carton full of salt--- that's more or less what this is. One of these will last a long time, but I will order this again, it's tasty stuff!

review/summary: It's salt... nothing special.
review/text: I kept waiting to write this review, making batch after batch of popcorn, making excuses in my head for the salt (and oil) seeming to be nothing special.<br /><br />I got a $50 Amazon gift card for my birthday, and I like to use gift money to buy things I usually wouldn't. I bought coconut oil, this salt, and special popcorn kernels, coming to a total of nearly $50.<br /><br />Yes, I like popcorn that much.<br /><br />The oil and kernels arrived before the salt, so I made one batch that way (with plain salt). The next day, after this salt arrived, I made a second batch.<br /><br />I could not tell a difference in flavor.<br /><br />I can't complain about the amount you get for the price (think a container the size of a quart of milk), I'll never use it all up. But the problem is, it seems like I might as well use plain salt (which would be even cheaper).<br /><br />I'd recommend not wasting your money on this, but I can't rate it less than three stars, since it is salt. They offered salt, it is salt... it's just nothing more than that.

review/summary: A LOT of product for your $$$
review/text: You know those quart milk cartons?  That's what this is; a LOT of salt, enough to last thru literally hundreds of pounds of popcorn.  Well worth the few bucks, so don't overthink it.  More than enough salt to share with friends or family if you don't want to keep it around for years, as you will likely not use it all before the date printed on the package.<br /><br />I'm using coconut oil and Flavacol as many posters have suggested.  This combo makes GREAT popcorn!  On the stovetop, I'm heating the oil, adding the Flavorcol, then the kernels. It's popping up fluffy and yellow.  Great smell and great taste.  Then I bought a West Bend Stir Crazy, adding the salt to the oil as some reviewiers suggested.  Absolutely love the convenience of the Stir Crazy over the stovestop, but too much salt remains on the popper, so I just shake it on immediately after popping, while still hot.<br /><br />Right now, I'm not using fancy or gourmet popcorn, just the regular store stuff.  It is still great.<br /><br />Couple of tips:<br /><br />1) The package lists recommended amount of product for the amount of popcorn you're making.  Remember, this product is basically salt with artificial flavor and color added, so preferences will vary. Start with the recommended amount on the package and experiment. Just remember, you can always add more if not salty enough, but your batch is ruined if you use too much.<br /><br />2) I use a dredge (shaker) for easier dispensing.  The carton is not convenient for regular usage.<br /><br />So if you're a popcorn lover and want to take your popcorn to the next level, this is a good start.

review/text: This is the 'flavor' of movie house popcorn. You will also want to use the oil too. I have tried several different oils from grocery. And when I took to the web to find oil to help give it that real Movie house taste, I knew already they normally use coconut oil. So was thrilled to find you can find the coconut oil for popcorn on here (AMAZON). And knowing the benefits of Coconut oil, even though popcorn oil is not virgin coconut oil, I feel far better just using this. While the oil is necessary. You have to have the FLAVACOL for the movie house flavor of their butter and salt.

review/text: I enjoy popcorn in a variety of forms.  Cooked on the stove, in the microwave, made into caramel corn, etc.  My favorite, though, has to be that yellow, salty variety you get at the local movie or bar.  I could eat that stuff until.. well... I'm stuffed.<br /><br />I've tried to reproduce that theater flavor at home, but failed miserably until I bought Flavacol.  Sprinkle some of this on microwave popcorn, and it's a close approximation of the movie theater variety.<br /><br />But pop the corn in coconut oil and season it with this (or better yet, put this in with the oil), and what you've got will taste just like you bought it at your local movie house.<br /><br />The best thing about Flavacol, though, is that a little goes a long way.  You'll be able to pop huge amounts of corn before you use up this container.

review/summary: Flavacol Popcorn salt
review/text: Gold Medal Flavacol was shipped quickly.  It is more than just a box of salt with coloring. When the product is mixed with coconut oil it delicately enhances the natural flavor of the popcorn. This is as close to original movie popcorn as I have found.

review/text: The taste of this reminds me a little more like popcorn from a carnival or the kind they sell at Target up front, not movie popcorn, which is why I bought it.<br />That said, it's not *bad* just average.

review/text: This is great for adding that buttery/salt flavor to your freshly popped popcorn... One word of caution you don't need to add a lot, just a light sprinkle will do.  Do not over do it because if you do, your popcorn will be insanely salty!!

review/summary: Very good butter-flavored salt
review/text: This is one of the best! Most butter-flavor salt you buy at grocery stores are overwhelmed by the fake flavoring they use. They don't make your popcorn taste salted. Believe me, I've tried them all! I used to buy mine from Mille de Lac, but they quit producing it so I had to search someplace else. After rying all the others, I went to Amazon to see what they had to offer. I was hesitant to spend that much on something I hadn't tried but it was well worth it. There's enough popcorn salt in it to last for years. You'll truly enjoy your popcorn with this salt.

review/text: This salt is artificially colored and artificially flavored; the only real food ingredient in it is salt!  This won't matter at all to some people, but will to others.  I wish I had seen an ingredients list before buying it!  So it is going straight to Freecycle.

review/summary: Movie theater taste without the price!
review/text: I have long been searching for the secret ingredient to movie theater popcorn. Those ingredients are flavacol and coconut oil. Put those two together with good popping corn and you will be in popcorn heaven! Be sure to buy virgin coconut oil to avoid the super unhealthy fat. While virgin coconut oil does have lots of saturated fat, it is good saturated fat. True movie theater popcorn has the bad stuff, unfortunately. Flavacol is definitely what gave my popcorn that signature salty/buttery taste. Coconut oil provides the last nuance of flavor. Have fun!

review/summary: Don't forget to buy this salt for your popcorn!
review/text: It is a very fine orange salt I add to my whirlipop along with popcorn coconut oil. My husband, previously known as the  popcorn hater, now tries to eat the entire batch. It really does make all the difference. I add around 1 tsp to the mix in the beginning. I just recently purchased this, a whirlipop and a wabash valley popping oil for a christmas gift for my father-in-law who is also a popcorn enthusiast. He keeps talking about that popcorn I made last time they came to visit. This recipe is also great for those lactose intolerant people and then the rest of the family doesn't have to suffer with yogurt butter or something horrible like that dribbled on top.

review/summary: I wont' lie...sodium content is through the roof.  But this is the real deal.
review/text: I worked for three years at a movie theatre, and this is the exact product we used when popping in our kettle.  This, combined with a popcorn-specific oil will give you the exact movie theatre-style popcorn you're looking for.  I recently purchased this product along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RC6R">West Bend 82306 Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YLI9E2">Paragon Coconut Popcorn Popping Oil (Gallon)</a>, and now I have the exact taste I was looking for.  Perfect!  Just use sparingly!  1 teaspoon of this stuff is 114% of your daily recommended sodium intake.

review/summary: It's the best you can buy!
review/text: This popcorn seasoning salt is so much better tasting than just plain salt. Also it stays on the popcorn much better than salt because is is not as coarse as salt and thus gets distributed more evenly over all the popcorn. Large size container will last a long time too. I cannot find this product in stores so thanks Amazon for making it available.

review/summary: Nummy on Air Popped corn
review/text: We enjoy hot air popped corn to cut the oil but it also cuts flavor so what we have come up with is to spray butter flavored cooking spray on the frshly popped corn the sprinkle on some Flavacol, toss in the bowl and repeat until you get the right flavor. Be aware that a LITTLE Flavacol goes a long way so don't over do it!!!

This came in a quart contaniner which is enough for me for about 2 years but I store it in a vacuum sealed bag, which should keep it fresh. Love it!

review/summary: Amazing Flavor
review/text: I really thought this would just be like the stuff you buy at the grocery store for seasoning popcorn while it pops.  I only bought it because of numerous reviews that said Flavacol and coconut oil were the secrets to great-tasting popcorn.  I used about 1/3 tsp in my Whirly-pop popper with 3 tablespoons oil and 1/3 cup popcorn.  I added the Flavacol to the oil in the pan and swirled it around to distribute it evenly before adding the popcorn.  The taste was amazing.  A surprising amount of the Flavacol actually got on the popped kernels instead of sitting in the bottom of the popper.  Of course some of that may have been due to the wonderful Wirly-pop popper which you crank to stir during the entire popping process.  The popcorn was buttery and had just the right amount of salty flavor.  This is NOT like the stuff you buy at the grocery store or that comes inside some bags of grocery store popcorn.  I have enough for at least 5 years.  I only wish they sold it in smaller packages.
