review/summary: Great attempt, but a failed product.
review/text: These seemed like a great idea. I would be able to load up 50 k-cups with any type of coffee I chose, and still maintain the speed of using the store bought cups in my rush to get ready every morning. After waiting a month for this product to reach me (20 days before they even shipped it!) I finally found it on my doorstep.<br /><br />Upon opening the box my hopes lifted even higher; these are solid little cups of a much higher quality than I expected. I filled one and snapped the lid down. I ensured it was sealed all the way around, placed it in my Kuerig, and hit the brew button. At first it seemed to be working splendidly then coffee began pouring out of places it isn't supposed to. By the time it was over I had quite a mess to clean up. Upon opening the Kuerig I found the DisposaKup completely in tact and the lid still secured properly. However the bit of overhanging filter was soaked, dripping, and HOT! I had discovered the source of the leak. I have tried again several times with the same reoccurring problem. I guess I should have bought the EcoBrew cup after all.<br /><br />If you like the appearance of convenience, and the reality of spending more time cleaning up a mess this is the product for you.<br /><br />(I went ahead and gave it two stars because I like the idea of the product so much.)

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: I have been using the DisposaKups for about 2 weeks.  They are easy to put together and fill.  Caps fit snug.  I sometimes get overfill, but my Cuisinart does that with regular K-Cups.  I put regular coffee in it, Maxwell House, Community Coffee, sometimes I grind my own.  Coffee always taste just like in drip coffee maker.  Great replacement for K-Cups cause they have literally doubled in price in just 6 months.

review/summary: Good concept, but....
review/text: Nice idea...to create self-filling cups for those who own Keurig Brewers but want to use their own bagged coffee, or those who do not want to incur the high cost of purchasing pre-made brewing cups.  The idea is, one takes a plastic cup, puts in the pre-molded filter, adds one's own coffee grounds, closes the cup with the lid and then pops the cup into the brewer, disposing of it at the end.  However...the plastic on the cups is a bit flimsy, such that if one pushes too hard down on the lid, the entire cup collapses, accordion style...another drawback is that the lids do not fit snugly without careful maneuvering, so that it can take longer than one might expect to close the cups...these two problems defeating the purpose of "fast" which is basically the primary advantage of Keurig brewers in the first place.  Another advantage of the brewer is the lack of a mess, which these cups also do not address well....there is always coffee left to either drip down or on top of the lid following brewing which requires cleanup of the cup holder...granted it is not major clean-up, but nevertheless...  And finally, the potential advantage of cost savings...the cups appear to be relatively inexpensive, but add in the cost of shipping and handling, which is some $6 on top of the featured price (about 50% more), and the per cup price increases...try purchasing multiple packages to reduce shipping cost...no go, the company just doubles the cost of shipping one package; ergo, if you were to say order 100 cups, you would pay more than 30 dollars and a third would be shipping and handling.  In addition to the other problems with the design, it more or less defeats the purpose.  Large packages of the pre-made pods can be purchased for nearly the same per-pod cost.  Would not recommend these, until the company lowers shipping costs, improves design, or both.  You're better off just using the mesh filter pod that comes with your brewer, and simply rinsing it out...same time involved, less cost and lower environmental impact.

review/text: I purchased the cups, lids and filters.  They work exactly how I expected them to work.  Perfectly!  The lids and cups can be used more than once.  The filters unfortunately cannot.  I am going to be looking in the future for cups that have the filters attached like in the regular prefilled k-kups.  Very good product though!

I found that true at first until I just used one finger and pressed them on in the center.  I heard a click and they were ready to go.  I will order a larger amount next time to save on shipping.  The hot chocolate K-cups prefilled are terrible, but these filled with your own chocolate mix are very good.

review/summary: Great for using your own coffee!
review/text: I recently went to Hawaii and bought tons of coffee. It was such a pain to use the My K-Cup attachment on the Keurig machine because I'd have to dump it out and wash it after every use. DisposaKups are a great alternative and work wonderfully with my machine! It's now super easy for me to use my own coffee! The only drawbacks I have found is that you really have to fill the filter all the way up to get good flavor. It leaks a little bit so the outside of the cup is a bit wet after using. Lastly, water moves through it a bit slower than normal K-cups so brewing a cup takes a bit longer than normal. I would still highly recommend this to anyone who wants to use their own coffee with their Keurig machine!

review/summary: Great product! Great value!
review/text: These cups work great! We have had a Keurig for about a year and use a refillable filter cup. Its so tedious to refill every time you want a cup of coffee. Especially at 4am before work! These cups are so easy to use and perfect for mornings when you just want a quick cup of coffee. The lids are a little tough to get on sometimes and they get stuck in the top of the machines occasionally, but still much less work than the filter cup we were using before. We get a basketful ready at the beginning of the week and they are ready to go each morning. It's GREAT! So much more affordable than the name brand cups. Great product, great value!

review/summary: These work great!
review/text: For those reviews that say the coffee wasn't strong enough or the cup leaked, they simply don't know what they're doing.  First of all, use the right kind of coffee.  The first time I used it, I put in a medium roast that wasn't ground very fine.  And yes, the coffee was weak.  So I switched to a VERY FINELY ground dark roast and it was perfect.  And yes, they will leak and leave grounds in your Keurig if you don't let some of the filter hang over the edge and seal it correctly.  I had no problem with sealing the cup...so far so good.  Makes as good a cup of coffee as the more expensive ready-made k-cups and have yet to find any grounds in my coffee or in the Keurig.  Really a good deal, plus I had them three days after ordering.  Very quick shipping.

review/text: I decided to give these a try.  The lids are VERY difficult to put on and I often ended up bending the cup while trying to affix the lid.  They do not seal perfectly and I often found unexpected puddles, but they do the job.  Since I have a Keurig permanant filter I thought of just buying the paper filters to save on cleanup.  For almost $11 from this vendor, you can get 50 (fifty) paper filters.....I would just assume use paper towels.  That works out to be just under 25 cents for a small piece of paper....DisposaKups, please re-evaluate your pricing!

review/text: Over a year ago I purchased a Breville K-Cups brewer and immediately found the the available selection and choices to exceed what I had expected. I loved using it and brewing what I wanted, 1 cup at a time. I found that I was paying about 40cents/cup and that was also great.<br />Now the prices have soared to nearly or over $1/cup and that has made me slow down my purchase rate and my enjoyment of my single cup brewer.<br /><br />Enter the DisposaKups and suddenly the price is reasonable again and I can grind my own or purchase Ekobrew and use their coffees. These are so simple, convenient and easy that I really enjoy that my world of coffee is wide open again.<br /><br />Thanks for such a great product!<br /><br />Ted

Doing so, you get just the fine coffee you want and are not trapped by the standard selections. But there's no saving money: $14/lb coffee works out to 25 cents per cup plus the 25 cents per DisposaKup gives 50 cents per cup, about the price of regular k-cups. Darn! Hoped I'd save money but I do get my choice.

Easy to use no mess, what's not to like.  If you have coffee maker that uses k-cups you have to try these, it puts you back in control of drinking the kind of coffee you like.

review/text: When I used the k-cup filter that came w/keurig, I didn't like the taste of any coffee I used so I stopped using it altogether.  However, when I saw DisposaKups on Amazon, I had my doubts but took a chance...They worked great.  Plan to keep them in stock.

review/summary: EXACTLY what I've been looking for to brew bagged coffee!
review/text: I am so grateful that DisposKups exist--and are now in use in my home!<br /><br />No other type of device for brewing bagged coffee in my Keurig (k-cup)or any other way to recycle K-cups has worked well for me. The standard device made by Keurig is so difficult to clean each time, that I just choose to never use it.<br /><br />DisposaKups are the perfect item for brewing my favorite coffees that are not available in K-cup form.  The pieces fit together perfectly, and with a "snap" -- I'm able to brew a cup of coffee and still have the disposable feature of regular k-cups (and no clean up!) Plus, you can assemble however many custom K-cups ahead of time with disposaKups, so they are very helpful to have for holiday gatherings and parties.<br /><br />Thank you thank you!  I will be purchasing a big supply soon, so I will be well-stocked for the holidays!

review/summary: Quick, easy and cheap K-Cups
review/text: The DisposaKups work as advertised.  They are easy to use, just put your favorite coffee in the cup, pop the cap on and brew.  This allows me to save quite a bit of money while using my favorite coffee.  I filled about 25 of them at one time so there is always one standing by when I am desperate for a cup.  There is no need to wash out a filter, just toss it in the trash like the store bought K-cups.  They also make a good backup system if you run out of the store bought k-kups.<br />I would be interested to know if the company uses, or plans to use, recycled plastic or plastic alternatives in the manufacturing of these.

review/summary: Disposable K-Cups for Keurig Brewers
review/text: I was very excited to see a product such as this being offered on line, as I loved the coffee I was drinking before I got a Keurig.  (My previous coffee is not offered in a K-cup version.)  Very promptly I placed an order and couldn't wait for it to arrive. I placed my fresh beans into my grinder and ground them a little courser than I would have if I was using my Bunn coffee pot.  I then proceeded to place the filter into the disposable K-cup, add my freshly ground beans and placed the cap on tightly.  Great!! Ready to brew my first cup of my favorite coffee.  The whole procedure worked well until the cycle was almost finished and then it happened.  Scalding hot water started squirting out of my Keurig machine from all sides.  I was trying to move my cup to catch the water, but it was coming out too fast and very hot.  I was disappointed with the performance of this product.  The coffee was good, although not a full cup and I had a mess to clean. I have tried grinding the beans finer and courser, also tried to fill the cups at different levels, but the results are still the same.  I will continue experimenting with the disposable K-cups and if I find the right combination, I will let you know.

review/summary: I love DisposaKups!
review/text: This product works just as described!  You simply place a filter in the disposable cup, add your own coffee, snap on the lid, and make the cup of coffee as you would with a regular K Cup.  The coffee is just as good as any prepackaged K Cups, and you can use the brand of your choice at a fraction of the cost (and no washing out those pesky mesh reusable filters!) As some other reviewers have noted, sometimes the cup gets stuck on the handle that raises as you are trying to remove the used cup.  But you simply pull it out and I've never had a lid fall of, so there is still no mess.  I will definitely continue to use this product!

review/summary: Very good alternative to premade
review/text: I have ordered three boxes of these so far.  They work very well.  Shipping was fast.  Their claim to fame is the ability to pre-fill these little cups and store them for later.  I just store them in the freezer.  The problem with most refillable/disposable filter k-cups, is that they are prepared on a per-cup basis.  To me this defeats the whole usefulness of the k-cup system.  Instead with these, I can sit at the table, and quickly throw together all 50 and store them.  Convienience is maintained and the cost effectiveness goes up as these are so much cheaper than buying the prepared ones.

review/summary: Great Concept- Iffy Execution
review/text: I recently purchased DisposaKups from this seller! Not only did I receive great customer service and fast shipping, but my product came packaged perfectly. I absolutely love the idea of the DisposaKups. However, after using a few, they just don't live up to my expectations. The lid often gets stuck in the keurig when its done brewing, sometimes the holes don't poke properly, and every time i am left with water spewing out in all directions while it brews. Definitely not a replacement for MyK or Solofill.

review/summary: Not what I hoped for...
review/text: I purchased this product for a couple of reasons.  First, with the cost of k-cups, this offered a lower price option.  Second, this allows me to used the coffee of my choice (decaf, organic, water-processed).<br /><br />The first couple of times I used these, the coffee was very weak.  I opened a regular k-cup that I had to see if there was a difference in grind size from what I was using; there was not.  Then I poured the contents of the k-cup into my disposable k-cup and it would not fit.  Apparently, the disposable cups hold less coffee, which could account for the weakness.  I also noticed that the disposable cups leak around the rim, and I often get grounds in my cup.<br /><br />I started packing as much coffee as I could into the cups, to where I could barely get the top on.  This made a much better cup of coffee.  However, they still leaked, there were still grounds in my coffee, and it make my Keurig run MUCH slower.  Not to mention the cleanup...<br /><br />My business uses a Keurig so that all of us can brew the coffee of our choice, and we also have a couple of tea and hot chocolate drinkers.  Everytime I use the disposable cups, I have to wipe down the machine, drip tray & my cup.  I also have to clean out the interior of the cup recepticle so that the next person doesn't have to put up with my leftovers.  All in all, these were a nice idea, but the amount of work they require makes paying a little exta for the convenience of regular k-cups more attractive.  I will probably use up what I have and then go back to the regular k-cups or find a more landfill friendly solution.

review/summary: Liking things that make sense and work
review/text: I will start by being kind, It is a good idea to save money with an item or concept like this. It makes good sense to use your own coffee beans and avoid the cost of the pre-filled commercial K-cups you buy at the store.<br /><br />Now, I received my DisposaKups over a month after ordering them and put them to use.  I was immediately disappointed, filters did not hold very much coffee, It was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup.  The coffee was very weak.<br /><br />This product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made K-cups. The body and lids are plastic.  Normal K-cups do not have a plastic lid.  Notice they say 100% disposable....So put them in the trash. They are not recyclable = landfill.<br /><br />They are not convenient, they are a bit messy, a pain to put together and still expensive.  Not worth it! There are better alternatives out there that will save you money, make better coffee and not go into a landfill.<br /><br />Sorry, I wish I had better news, I think I will return these.

I tried one right away...  the coffee started running down the front of my Kreuig.

I have subsequently tried more of the orrigional 10 that I filled, after carefully checking that they were properly put together, and all melted in the same way.  I have since thrown the rest away because I was tired of the mess they created!  Don't buy these... they do not stand up to hot water.

review/text: Looking at all the disposable/reusable K-Cup designs I think I will forgo purchasing any at this time and continue to use my tried and true *free* method.<br />*Free after the cost of an original K-Cup.<br /><br />After using your K-Cup filled with coffee that you've purchased:<br /><br />Take off the aluminum lid that seals the top.<br />Empty grounds into the trash or compost.<br />Rinse out the inside.  You will see there is already a filter inside.<br />Fill with your own coffee.<br />Place a small square of aluminum foil on top and be sure to make it tight and sealed around the top edges of the cup.<br /><br />Now reuse your cup a few times or many, it's up to you as long as the filter holds up.  Just re-do all the steps for each cup you make.

review/summary: Save money but use with care
review/text: There is known design flaw having to do with the gasket on the upper needle. You can hear the screams about that by reading the reviews for the 'My Cup'. The gasket moves too much and as a result is does not seal correctly. Green Mountain seems to not want to fix it since it means selling less over-priced coffee, which is what these machines are designed to do.<br /><br />1. No matter what method I use, I have learned to carefully reach in and pull the little washer/gasket down as far as I can on the upper needle. This will ensure a better seal and avoid overflow.<br /><br />2. Just as importantly when I put the DisposaKup in, I press it down to make sure the lower needle has pierced the cup completely. This will make sure you have a flow of water that streams through the cup.<br /><br />3. Fill it up and then tap the cup on the counter to settle the coffee grinds into the cup, do not press the coffee down or pack it in.<br /><br />The key is take a couple extra seconds and these will work perfectly and you will save money. I love mine and will be ordering more once they are available again.

review/summary: How to stop the leaking!
review/text: After a lot of trial and error (with just water!) I figured out how to make these handy self-fill coffee pods NOT leak all over the place. The secret is to shove the filter all the way into the pod and NOT snap the lid over the edge of the filter. Make sure the filter is ALL INSIDE. It's rigid enough and stays upright and fine when you brew. You really need to create a seal with the lid. Leaving the filter hanging out breaks the seal and allows liquid to seep out.

review/summary: Almost; but not quite
review/text: We use the K-caps so that we can re-use our K-cups by refilling them with the coffee we like.  We have lost or given away several of the caps over the 2 years that we've been using them; so I thought I would buy some more K-caps.  It turns out, the prices for them have increased substantially; so I went in search of another alternative that would be less expensive.  I found these and thought I had found the answer; but they don't quite work as well as the original K-cups.  They actually caused the Keurig to spew water in directions other than the intended direction and then allowed enough coffee grounds to escape that the holder for the cups became clogged and had to be disassembled and thoroughly cleaned before it could be used again.  Good idea - but not quite right.

review/text: This comment refers to ALL OF THE DO IT YOURSELF K-CUPS.<br />My K-Cup by Keurig<br />Ekobrew<br />EZ Cup.<br /><br />They products above ALL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.<br />You have to get the correct grind on the whole coffee bean.<br />And it's NOT what you think if you are familiar with grinding espresso.<br /><br />If water is coming out the top, (of the products listed above) the grind is too small and/or too much volume.<br />The coffee is too weak and you jump to the conclusion it's because the grind is too coarse or you do NOT have enough coffee.<br />Wrong, it's because the water went over the top and NOT THRU THE GROUNDS is the reason it is weak.<br />Start off with about 1-3/4 tablespoons (do not exceed 2 tablespoons)<br />The grind will probably be MORE COARSE than what you typically use for BUNN type drip.<br /><br />Once I got the right combination of grind setting and amount of coffee, ALL OF THESE FILTERS worked.<br /><br />I have the capresso infinity conical burr grinder.<br />For Duncan Donut Whole Bean I use the<br />MEDIUM #4 position.<br />I use two tablespoons.<br /><br />There are 16 grind settings<br />Extra Fine 1-4<br />Fine 1-4<br />Meduim 1-4<br />Coarse 1-4<br /><br />Note that for Bunn drip coffee I use Medium #2<br /><br />For espresso I used from fine #3 to other settings ... (adapted to get a 25 second draw)<br /><br />Once you get the right RECIPE they all work.<br /><br />But .....<br />Where this product comes in handy is NOT IN BREWING coffee, but in storing your recipe in an AIR TIGHT CONTAINER.<br /><br />Grind a weeks worth of coffee and store it in these cups with the lid on and no holes in the bottom.<br /><br />Then during the week, grab one of these already premeasured cups,<br />remove the lid<br />and pour into the My Keuring K-Cup<br /><br />I found that if the grind is toward the fine side, all these will leak. The My K-cup was the best of the lot for not leaking,<br />But like I said above if the get the grind more toward the coarse side they ALL WILL WORK.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />This product is great for storing pre-measured amounts that you have ground earlier in weekly batches.<br />Make your measuring and grinding mess ONCE and then fill up 14 or so of these cups with your own recipe.<br /><br />If you want to get more accurate, instead of using tablespoons get a good digital scale for weighing.<br /><br />Note that if you are in a hurry then go ahead and DO USE THIS PRODUCT as advertised here.<br />I just thought that these were too expensive also and that you had to keep reordering them.<br />But yes go ahead and use them if you want to do that.

review/text: These do work nicely, but some of them for some reason seem to "stick" on the upper "needle".  I have yet to figure out why they stick on that needle, but when they do it is a real "pain" to remove it!  This is a minor, and only a sometimes glitch, so that is why 4 stars in stead of 5.<br />My machine in a brand new one, so the needle being "dirty" isn't the problem.  When these don't stick, they work very nicely and as stated.<br />I wish the little cups that hold the filters were biodegradable as that would be a real plus..., but these do save money since the k-cups are so expensive.  I will continue to use these, and spend the savings on really great coffee!!  LOL!

review/text: I have never enjoyed my Keureg more!  They couldn't be easier to use and I'm so happy to be using my favorite coffee and making it to my own specifications.  Love these things!!<br /><br />Additional comment:  In reading the reviews I see some complaints about leakage, etc... one trick I have come to rely on is NOT to fill the kup all the way to the top with the coffee.  You need to leave some room at t the top so that the lid isn't touching the coffee inside (maybe a little less than 1/2cm from the top rim).  When I follow this protocol, I get a perfect cup every time.  When I fill it too high, I end up with leakage.  The only problem is that I usually need a cup of coffee int he morning before I can follow my own instructions.

review/text: I tried these disposaKups several times, and each time the filter came loose at the top resulting in coffee and grounds everywhere.  The kup and lid are both made from flimsy plastic that softens at the brewing temperature.  The result is a loose fit at the top during brewing, distortion of kup at the bottom (because filter is forced down) and coffee and grounds everywhere.  The lids work one time with OEM Keurig kups (cleaned and refilled), but the second time they are loose and result in overflow.  An email to the company for a refund was not answered.  Do not buy these!

review/summary: Neat concept
review/text: Neat concept. Other contraptions to use your own coffee have prepunched holes and are designed much differently than the K-Cup. This is like a do it yourself K-Cup. However, because this consists of a disposable cup, filter, and a cap and is punched by the brewer, I would not be surprised if this mechanism infringed on Keurig's patents. Oh, and the video review submitted by the other reviewer looks suspiciously like the video on the manufacturers website :)

review/summary: Why Didn't Someone Think Of This Sooner?
review/text: Empty K-Cups, miniature filters and lids allow you to use your own favorite ground coffee.  If you buy roasted beans and grind your own, this is the solution for you.  One scoop in the K-Cup, put on the lid and pop it into your Kuerig.<br /><br />I shied away from buying a Kuerig because I love my Kenya-AA from Talk 'n Coffee in Deptford, NJ.  They roast it dark, grind it almost to percolator coarseness for me (sigh) and ship it to me here in Florida.  I had tried mesh filters but even with my custom percolator grind, I'd get grinds in the brew.  The special cup holders looked like a labor-intensive solution too so I stuck with my Mr. Coffee.  When I saw the disposable cups on Amazon, I ordered them along with the Keurig.<br /><br />This works great!  A single fresh hot cup of Kenyaa AA dark roast whenever the spirit moves me and no worries about having to make a partial pot for only one cup.  I'll have Talk 'n Coffee grind the beans a little finer for the Kuerig on my next order.  I re-ground my percolator grind a little finer and the portion strength is now perfect for the travel mug size.<br /><br />Kathy buys loose tea and uses the disposable K-Cup for a mug whenever it suits her fancy.  It's a lot easier than the little metal thingie with the chain and waiting for a kettle to boil.<br /><br />One benefit I hadn't counted on is that clean-up is easy and fast - pluck the used disposable K-Cup from the Kuerig and toss it in the trash.  No more having to service the coffee pot!<br /><br />To save time in the morning, I used to set up Mr. Coffee the night before but now I just make up the disposable K-Cups a dozen at a time and we fresh-brew by the cup in the morning for several days running. We actually use less coffee after evaporation and "who doesn't want the last cup" considerations.  I think the savings on coffee and Mr. Coffee filters is probably break-even with the cost of the disposable K-Cups so net-net, they seem free.<br /><br />Only one con from me.  It's hard for these arthritic old hands to fit the lid on due to the filter overlapping the top of the K-Cup.  Folding or cutting away the overlap causes grinds in the brew and a clogged lower needle.  I don't think there is a cure without the downside being greater than the problem.  I have found patience and not over loading the K-Cup to be the best solution.

review/summary: 1st time using disposakups
review/text: Great product.  I was looking for a way to use my coffee in my krueig machine (by cuisinart) with out having to use the supplied filter.  Let's face it, the whole point is to make a cup of coffee using the k-cup and not have to fill the little filter, then clean it afterwards.  Kinda defeats the purpose.  I was looking for this type of item and hoping that I could pre-package my brand of coffee. I was skeptical at first, but thought for the price, I'd give it a try AND the product works GREAT.  I fill up the 50 cups with the filter, lid and store it in an old K-cup box.  The lids fit tight and it works just like the more expensive k-cups. The only issue is that on my 12 cup setting, there is a little spill over, but there are no problems with the 10 cup setting.  Once in a while when you open the top to put in another cup, it will stick to the top of the machine where the hole punctures the cup, but that's in once in a while.  In fact I am about to purchase again.  I only wish the shipping wasn't as much as the product.  It arrived earlier than scheduled I believe. All in all, I will be using these on a regular basis.

review/text: I thought these would be the perfect answer. Sadly, I guess the pressure with which my Keurig machine shoots the water through the k-cup is too much for the disposa cup, because every single time I tried it, coffee grounds were spewed up through the tiny hole in the lid of the disposa cup all over the inside of where the k-cup sits in my keurig. And yes, I used them properly.<br /><br />So the issue, at least in my Keurig machine, seems to be with the lids. Some have suggested its a design flaw with the Keurig machine. In either case, these disposa cups were NOT the answer for me.<br /><br />Biggest waste of money ever. I cannot recommend.

Most important, and this IS IMPORTANT, IT IS MADE IN CHINA, so you just can't be sure that it is free of chemicals that are released during the brewing process.  Other products clearly state that they are Chemical free.  I can't remember if it BTh or BHT, but take that into consideration.  BUY SOMETHING ELSE.  PLEASE.

I didn't want them to go to waste, so I bought this figuring I could make her k-cups with her own coffee. The cups are flimsy, first of all (most of them buckle too easily while getting the top on). It *looks* like a good seal (and yes, I made sure there were no coffee grounds on the edge, which I know can screw up the seal), but they still leak. Get one of the reusable cups. It'll be better for you and your Keurig.

review/summary: Did not work well - clogged my machine
review/text: I was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original K-Cups, but was very disappointed in the product.  Though the cups came with no instructions, it was apparent that you just put the filter in, add coffee, then pop the lid on.  Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups.  So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid.  After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working.  I cleaned out with vinegar and tried again, but same result.  I ended up throwing these away as it didn't seem worth the effort to return them.  NOT a good product!

review/summary: Great product
review/text: The pods worked as described.  I did not have overflows. I found the best way to secure the top is to press the raised area in the center of the top. Wish they were sold in larger quantities

review/summary: Good try ...but
review/text: I was really hoping that your product would solve my discontent with the Keurig coffe maker that I received for Xmas.  I am a coffee and chicory drinker so of course I wanted to have the same great coffee thru the Keurig machine.  The mesh filter that I bought first left a slimed residue in the brew....so I believed that the paper filter you created would do the job....well it does it's work properly but it is a little large for the Keurig device....so water and grinds sort of go everywhere.......I dont think your product isnt good ...the whole Keurig experience is a great disappointment!

review/summary: Very helpful. I can use my own coffee
review/text: I had been looking for something to use with my own coffee. I know the Keurig has its own My K-cup but I wasn't satisfied with the results. There were also suggestions on making personal k-cups by saving the used k-cups and rinsing them out and refilling them with coffee and then covering them with foil or plastic wrap. What a pain that was.<br /><br />After looking at several different disposable k-cups for the keurig I came across this one and felt it did what I wanted. Much less mess involved and works great.

review/summary: Disposable is great!
review/text: These DisposaKups work great.  I simply fill up a dozen or more with my favorite flavored coffee, and I'm good to go.  It's a great alternative to buying the expensive pre-filled K-cups; not only were the pre-filled K-cups expensive, but they don't offer my favorite coffee blends.  I was using the reusable K-cup filters which are quite expensive to purchase, so I only had 2 & they leaked while brewing & were messy to empty and wash to re-use.  The DisposaKups work much better--just as well as the pre-filled K-cups, no leaks, no mess!  And I can re-use them again if I want by throwing out the filter, rinsing, & using a fresh filter (just have to line up the holes).  Great product! I highly recommend it.  I love my coffee machine again.

review/summary: Like but not perfect
review/text: I recieved my DiposaKups and was a little disappointed.  First, they took quite awhile to arrive in the mail, however when I was tracking the product, it did say that it would take some time to deliver.  I have the Keurig Cuisinart, and the cups work ok, but they don't allow the machine to finish the brewing process.  It doesn't allow the hinge to completely close, which won't let the machine complete the brewing.  I have to take the cup out in order for it to finish.  HOWEVER, it is very convenient and makes it much more cost effective, but I don't know that I would buy them again because I'm worried I may ruin my machine.

review/text: Awesome idea!  I couldn't find my husband's favorite coffee in the k-cups, so I bought these to make my own.  Works great with loose leaf teas too.

review/summary: Good product - expensive shipping
review/text: I purchased this product to be able to use my own coffee and tea in the Keurig. The product does what it says. The only drawback that I can tell exists is the expensive shipping. I'd also like to have some suggested measurements for coffee and tea to fill the cup. Perhaps a section on their website where people can just start recording their experiences with different amounts of product... Just my 2 cents.
