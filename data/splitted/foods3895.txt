review/text: My wife and I have fallen in love with these dark chocolate crepes. We order boxes from Amazon every so often and we go through them fairly quickly. We enjoy the light, crispy texture, and the chocolate is a good chocolate...although is there really a bad chocolate!

review/summary: try to eat only one
review/text: i have been looking for these cookies since i ate them in France  40 years ago.  found them at Fairway in NY and brought a box  back to Hawaii where i live.  (one box?  what was i thinking???) so i went to my favorite website (Amazon) and of course found them there.  the rest is history.  they are addictive, fabulous, and heavenly.  they are not inexpensive but worth every penny. i dare you to  try to eat only one!!!  i love the dark chocolate ones (because i adore dark chocolate and it is so healthy ! ;)  but the plain ones are great too with ice cream.  not a fan of milk chocolate.  i bought six boxes of the dark chocolate  and try to limit my eating of them.  i will be keeping them on hand forever.

And that's saying a lot, as we live in Minnesota and have a place in Wisconsin, the world capitals of the friday night Fish Fry. It is very easy to prepare (just add beer or water, I chose beer).

review/summary: Sopraffino! Or, Super!
review/text: Don't remember exactly how I cam across Saba but I did and the more I read about it, the more I wanted to try some. So, saved pennies, researched providers and Leonardi Saba seemed to be one of the few left who produce genuine Saba (here, Leonardi do themselves no favors. They should drop the phrase "balsamic vinegar" as it is inapplicable. Only by persistent searching did I find out that the "lesser producers" may sell you something resembling BV, Leonardi does NOT. If you care to know, The Saba or Sapa is one of the products of the tradition of Emilia Romagna, grape must comes made to bubble for hours  and filtering it in order to obtain a type of syrup that comes used in order to flavor various dishes. ) Tried this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001I9XR2">Acetaia  Leonardi Saba Balsamic Vinegar, 16.9 - Ounce</a> over the wife's homemade ice cream (from grapes) and WOW! Yes, it's expensive but a little goes a long way. Other uses? Per another supplier who is currently out of stock, "As a drink when diluted with water (sparkling water is delicious!), over shaved ice (granita), over ice cream, to sweeten breads and cookies, as a condiment on beans or polenta, or added to ricotta or yogurt. Add it to your tomato sauce instead of sugar to create an exceptional sauce. Try Saba in salad dressings and marinades for extra sweetness and flavor. When fresh fruits are in season, serve sliced with a little Saba drizzled on top. Make your own traditional "zuppa inglese" by pouring over pound cake." Look out tomato sauce, you're next!

review/text: This is the only vegetable type soup I can find that doesn't have any celery.<br />I read that cooked celery is bad for you. Raw celery is good.<br />This soup tastes good with bread and mayonnaise.<br />It only has 135mg sodium per serving. Compare that to 890mg in Campbell's vegetable soup.<br /> It also has broccoli and tomatoes in it. That combination has been recently discovered to shrink prostate tumors. But more than a cup of each is recommended.

review/summary: You don't know what good lime juice is...
review/text: ... until you've had *this* lime juice.<br /><br />I absolutely love everything lime; but I had no idea that the lime juice carried in typical grocery stores, and the sad limes in the produce aisles, really weren't living up to their potential. It sounds silly, but it's true.<br /><br />I had this for the first time in a Gin & Tonic at a friend's house. It had an amazing, lightly floral, aroma & flavor that I absolutely loved. I couldn't find it anywhere local, so I came to Amazon.<br /><br />Try it. I strongly suspect it's unlike anything you've had before; it was for me. For an even more incredible experience, try it with Hendrick's Gin; it's a wonderful synergy.<br /><br />Regarding the use of Sulfur Dioxide: it's a widely used preservative, especially in wine. It's a non-issue here.

review/summary: This Stuff is Terrific
review/text: This stuff is s-o-o-o-o much better than any other product I've tried. Indeed, the quality of this product can exceed the taste of fresh-squeezed lime juice if you aren't careful about choosing your limes. I've ordered six or seven over the last year or so and only one had a taste that was just a bit off. Again, I don't do better with lemons.<br /><br />I have amended this review owing to an angry - perhaps understandably so - comment indicating that some people may have a severe allergic reaction to the preservative in this product. I did some research and found that while such reactions are quite rare, they can be very serious. As such I will add to my review a very serious caveat that people allergic to sulpher dioxide should avoid this product. I don't know whether the amounts of that substance in this product are sufficient to trigger such a reaction, but, certainly it is better to act with caution.<br /><br />What I absolutely can vouch for is the quality of the taste of this product which is nearly impossible to distinguish from freshly squeezed limes.

review/summary: "Big" Dog?... Really?
review/text: The description for this product is misleading. These biscuits are not for big dogs - unless you consider 20 lbs, "big."  They are the same size as "small" or "puppy" biscuits from other brands.  In addition, my 6 month old pup is not a fan.  At first, she sniffed when I offered her one and she would turn and walk away.  Now, when she sees me pick up the box, she RUNS in the opposite direction. Like, "oh, hell no.."  It's actually quite comical.  Taste being a personal thing, my rating is really around the false advertising.  I was hoping for a larger biscuit that would keep her occupied for more than 20 seconds.  Big dog biscuits these are not.

review/text: I have been always careful about cat food. I recently moved to the US so I studied what was the best option for my cats here. As canned alternatives, I tried this product and Organix. I was happy with both of them, but super happy with this one, so I am considering also the 'Subscribe & Save' option. I have two adult cats that are free to get in & out from the loft. They share one 6-ounce can per day (in the morning), and eat dry food in the evening. They look healthy and active. Even if I had a single cat I would opt for the 6-ounce cans for best value (as compared to the 3-ounces cans).

Now all of a sudden he has Thyroid Problems, the vet said that it may have been because of the lining these cans have to preserve the food inside of them. That may have caused the Thyroid problems. I will never give my babies canned food. I have switched them to the pouched food, or the frozen food in plastic they sell at Whole Foods. Here is the website I found information on Thyroid Problems for Cats. [...]<br />Simon is an old man, almost 20, so I understand it was inevidable, but not something that was caused by me.

review/summary: The best for my cat
review/text: My cat can not eat seafood or gluten without disastrous consequences (such as me having to change my bed sheets at 3 a.m. because she jumped into bed with me after a litter box episode).  I have tried many expensive canned foods for her before finding this one that not only doesn't negatively impact her system but that she seems to really like.  Some are too stiff and sticky and some are too runny or contain peas and such in their whole form which the princess does not like.  This cat food is the perfect consistency and even though it contains vegetables they are blended into the formula.  I don't think the vegetables are necessary for cats but I suppose they aren't harming her, at least I hope not.  They are after all carbohydrates and I thought carbs were not good for cats.  But this food is working for us so I am not going to try changing it.  I'm thrilled that Amazon has made it available under the Prime umbrella recently and hopeful they will continue to do so.  My cat is a smallish fluffball, about 7 pounds I'd say, 100% indoor, and she eats less than one 6 oz can of this food each day.  I open a new can every morning and dole it out to her throughout the day whenever she wants, and there is almost always an ounce or more un-eaten and discarded by days end.

I feed the two girls each a half a can in the morning and another in the evening, my 15lb boy I feed 3/4 can twice a day. I also leave them a bowl of Blue Buffalo kibble out to snack on, which honestly they eat very little of and I am thinking of removing it from their diet. They can't wait to dig into the Natural Balance and once the bowl is down they inhale every last bit in less than 5 minutes. Their coats are super soft and shiny and their eyes are bright and shiny as well and they have crazy amounts of energy, annoyingly so at times as they sound like they're going to tear the house down with all the running, jumping and wrestling they do...even my 12 year old calico has developed much more energy and has been participating in the mayhem.

review/text: I switched to Natural Balance canned cat food last year when my vet said the cats should get more meat and as little grain as possible.  So I wanted a higher quality canned food than the grocery store stuff.  I have a two-year old male who will eat anything and a 17-year female who is very fussy.  Both love this flavor, also the turkey flavor.  I have tried the fish -- too smelly for the human who is feeding the cats!  The shrimp one is okay, but the female gets tired of it after a while.  The poultry flavors can be served day after day.  With free shipping on a case, it has become an easy routine.

review/summary: Good product, BPA fears no longer an issue
review/text: ****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn't seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6LVS">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM395E">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>, (and so I posted my review there as well).  I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />****UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least.

review/summary: Loyal Earths Best Customer
review/text: I absolutely love Earths Best foods. They have the largest variety of organic foods at the best prices. The 'gourmet' flavors are slightly more expensive at my grocery store, so I thought I would give Amazon a try. The order was perfect. My son (8 months) absolutely loves the gourmet flavors.  I also like the consistency of these flavors. It is 'mid-range': not too watery (like Earths Best Chicken & Rice flavor) but not too thick.

review/text: My son (9 months) seemed to enjoy these meals.  With the exception of the risotto dish though, I found them to be quite runny.  It was more difficult to feed him without making a mess.  The risotto though had a nice consistency.  The flavor combinations sounded good to me but I have to admit I don't usually taste them myself.

review/summary: Love the product but cheaper at BRU
review/text: I love these variety packs.  My only complaint is that you can get them cheaper at BRU (I found them for $9.99 for a 12 pack, regular price). That's the only reason I gave them 3 stars. But as far as the actual baby food goes, I don't feel like I could be buying anything better for my baby.  I make all of his fruit and vegetable baby food myself but I was a little overwhelmed at trying to do the meat ones.  I wanted to buy all organic but I live in a very small town and didn't want to mess with trying to find the closest place to get organic/hormone free/antibiotic free meat.  Not to mention the price and all the work to make it.  The ingredients in this baby food are all real, whole, organic foods.  No preservatives, nothing extra.  So easy!

review/summary: Favorite baby food set!
review/text: So far this has been my favorite baby food to serve my 10 month old.  We do a lot of homemade baby food, but being a busy mom of 2 I also buy a lot of jars now.  Will only do organic brands, and really like Earths Best brand because of their good combos and I like that they come in a glass jar.  I really like the gourmet meals pack, my baby liked all of the ones in this pack right from the start, even though he didn't love some of the plainer vegetable or meat dinners.  So I've been willing to pay slightly more to get the gourmet meals set.  Good way to get good protein sources into babies too.

Some absorbic acid. I highly recommend the product.<br /><br />I do not, however, recommend buying it here. The "regular" price that is crossed out is absolutely absurd. I have not seen this product over $10 in any store. Perhaps that's the price in NYC.

review/text: Our primary reason for buying this product is that it came in a variety pack.  We make most of our own baby food, but we were going on vacation and that was going to be difficult.  Since packing space was limited, we had this shipped to our destination.  It was the only brand we could find to order in a variety pack.  The kids liked all the flavors and the consistency seemed good.

review/text: My 9 month old has been happily eating fruit and whole grain combo as well as veggie and meat foods from Earth's Best.  These "gourmet" flavors sounded fun but she spat out and flatly refused to eat any of the four flavors in this multi pack.  I tasted them myself and they were pretty gross.  Somewhat annoying since I now have the remainder of this multipack sitting around.  That'll teach me to buy a whole pack untested!

review/text: I just received a box of these and almost half of them were either frozen and thawed, or packaged wrong. They weren't a creamy consistency at all, but chunky and watery. I have used Earth's Best for quite a while and never had any like this. We did just have a snow storm and it might have come through some icy conditions, but I had to throw half of them out. The other half looked fine. All the lids popped open, so the seals were fine. I have no idea what was wrong, but I won't be ordering these again.

review/text: Purchased for my 6-month-old & as you know babies tend to fluctuate in their interest for what they're eating. My baby enjoys this gourmet food however he does not like the Tender Beef Spinach . . . no matter what I've tried in changing the flavor (such as adding a fruit as a side dish), he still won't eat it. It's strange because he loves spinach, go figure. I've tasted all 4 flavors & they taste great to me. I rated 4-stars for this product only because my baby did not like nor would he eat the Tender Beef Spinach (even though I enjoyed the taste).

It can be difficult to find baby food with iron-rich beef that our baby actually likes, so we're happy with this one.

review/text: I chose this brand of baby food as I dont have enough time to prepare my own. Organic and nice it seemed. It states from 6 months and up. My son is 7 months. All of a sudden he started drinking large amounts of water which lead me to look closer at the label. There is up to 20 mg of sodium in these things!! A baby under 1 year has no kidney function and cannot eat salt! THen all of a sudden he had break outs in his face. Happened twice. I looked at what he had eaten those two times. SPINACH! A baby under one year should NOT have spinach! I am absolutely puzzled how a company producing food for babies, have no idea about the most general of knowledge concerning babies. I have taken my son off this food and am making my own and can only hope I have not damaged his little body by these two weeks of eating "Earths Best Organic"!

review/summary: improper seal = botulism risk!
review/text: I ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.  We were lucky because I just happened to check that one.  Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times.  I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it.  I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer.  Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!<br /><br />These are 2nd foods but please note that they're much more watery than Gerber or Beech-Nut 2nd foods.  I think the watered texture frustrates my son and I spill it everywhere when I feed him.  He likes the flavors fine except for the Chicken Mango Risotto (hates it).

review/summary: Lipton Sweetened Instant Tea Mix, Lemon,
review/text: Been getting this{on Amazon's Shop and Save Program} for 2 or 3 years now. The tea is very good for an instant tea. It is NOT like making tea from tea bags -- that, of course, is the BEST way to get the best tasting tea! But that takes time{and to make enough in quantity} takes even more time! If you don't want to go through all that, then this is a good tea to get. Some have said that it is tart or that it tastes like lemon-aid. THAT IS NOT TRUE! This tea does not taste like lemon-aid! It is tart -- but it tastes good too! It has a good mix of taste AND tartness. As far instant teas go, this is the best I've tasted{and I've been buying this for several years now]. Other instant teas just don't taste as good. If you're looking for a good-tasting instant tea, I know of none better!<br />  Just wanted to add something to my original review.I mentioned I get this tea through Amazon's Shop and Save Program.The good thing about this program is that you never have to be concerned about running out of tea.Before I joined this program,you never knew if the store would be out,or didn't order enough or maybe the warehouse forgot to order some.In fact,I always had to keep a 'back-up' tea{another brand that didn't taste as good} just in case the store didn't have the Lipton tea.With Amazon's Shop and Save Program,you never have to worry about this -- they ship it right to your door! No more keeping a 'back-up' tea anymore!And if you're thinking the store's tea is cheaper -- it's not! I priced Amazon's tea and the store's tea{same size here},and Amazon's price was actually lower! Plus too,under this program,the shipping is FREE! You can't afford NOT to get this tea through Amazon! To sum it up,this is a good-tasting instant tea and combining it with Amazon's Shop and Save Program is a can't miss deal!

review/text: I like my tea strong, and to taste like tea. I drink unsweetened tea when I'm super thirsty, but if I mix tea for work, or drinking at home in my recliner, I use the following blend:<br />1 Gallon size Lipton iced tea bag, (Luzianne works too.)<br />2 quarts water (I have a 3 quart tea maker.)<br />1 cup of this mix.<br />Lots of ice.<br />Strong, sweet, dark, and cold.<br />This is the best combination I've found for sweet, strong, dark iced tea.<br />Warning: This will stain your teeth and give you kidney stones if you drink more than a gallon a day, for an extended period of time.<br /><br />Also, this mix is good, but you can get it for less than 1/2 the price at Sam's club, if you can pick it up locally. I have it shipped to me when I run out of mix, since the nearest sam's club is quite a drive for me.<br />The mango flavor isn't bad, either.<br />**************************************************************************<br />For real tea taste, use real tea, and flavor it with sweetened mix, when you want more sweetness.<br />**************************************************************************<br />Tea is a very personal thing, and isn't for everybody, but this is very popular. You will probably make a sour face the first time you taste it.<br />After you finish a few glasses of this, you might not like bottled tea any more.

review/summary: The official drink of the Navy Seals
review/text: Flying over the rugged terrain of Pakistan, a team of Navy Seals, thirsty hungry and tired, were hot on the trail of a war criminal.  Their mission - bring him to justice.<br /><br />After weeks of searching in the hot Pakistani desert, they had finally located his mansion.  Inside, lay 20 or 30 guards.  The Navy Seal team approached but their dry throats kept them from being able to talk to each other.  That's when Navy Seal Team Commander Jacob Michaels commandeered an old barely functioning pump.  The sludge water was deadly toxic to people even to Bear Grylls and his pee drinking self.  Desperate, they opened their 10 quart tea mix, poured some in - and out came rainbows and goodness that the world has never seen before.  The seal team drank their magic tea elixir and continued on their mission.<br /><br />As they approached the house one of the Pakistani guards noticed the team, and called an alert.  20 bearded men started shooting randomly at the exposed seal team.  But by the grace of Lipton, the commander tossed his can into the middle of them, which exploded into a cloud of choking biohazardous gas.  8 of the Pakistanis died instantly, and the dust cloud made it easy for the Seal team to get inside.  Shouting FIRE IN THE HOLE three more canisters were tossed into the compound, blinding and choking most any living thing in the area.<br /><br />When breaking into Bin Laden's room, the Seals, now down to the last of their 6 cans, decided to hold back their can to help provide cover in case of a fire fight.  Breaking down the door, the commander - firearm in one hand, tea mix in the other, screamed DEATH TO BIN LADEN! and started firing.  Bin Laden fired back, shooting the can, which exploded into awesome particles of win, which surrounded him and suffocated him.  On his dying breath, the tea mix kicked him in the groin and shouted "USA BITCH!"<br /><br />The tea mix residue on the Navy Seal uniforms sped up the growth rate of their manly chest hair and beards, making them easy to spot - the handsome rugged bearded men of Seal Team Six.<br /><br />After being flown out of the area, all the hot British chick soldiers were so turned on by the smell of tea around the Navy Seals that they all started stripping which led to a massive orgy.<br /><br />This is why Lipton tea is the best tea anywhere and why buying anything less than a 6 pack makes you a pansy.

review/text: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046LCK5M">Roland Curry Sesame Seeds, 3.53-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> are yummy!  As a lover of curry, I was unsure as to how flavorful these would be and I was thrilled to discover that they are delicious and very fresh.  After checking the production code, I've discovered that the first batch I received was manufactured exactly one year ago, so they are good for some time.  Each bottle is sealed in plastic and a freshness seal is under the screw top.<br /><br />The ingredient list is:  sesame seeds, natural curry powder, salt, seasonings, sugar, spices.  The flavor is not a hot curry, but a sweeter version, so I tend to add garlic and pepper to mine.  For milder curry loving individuals, this might be perfect with no further addition.  I use it on rices, pastas, vegetables, in dips, combined with yogurt and lemon juice as a coating for searing fish, and on POPCORN!!  The smaller size bottle is ideal so that I do not get heavy handed and the two part screw off cap is great for shaking, pouring or scooping out with a measuring spoon.  (I typically only remove the top section for pouring.)  I actually use the curry sesame seeds instead of salt much of the time and have ground them into a delicious paste.  I must try other varieties some day, but for now, I'm satisfied with this flavor and recommend them to curry lovers.

review/text: Hint Waters are totally worth every penny you pay for them.  It's a premium over other beverages, yes, but the quality of water is outstanding.  The flavors are crisp, yet subtle (hence, Hint), and unlike anything else out there on the market.  No sugar at all, just well chosen natural flavors.  Even my picky daughter has switched over from drinking sugary fruit juices and now enjoys the blackberry flavor (and she was never into plain old water, too boring for her... and with too much sugar in conventional juice I was glad to find a viable alternative!).<br /><br />If you're on the fence about trying Hint waters, please do.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised on how uniquely refreshing they are.

review/text: I truly wanted this bottled, flavored water to taste great.........BUT IT DOES NOT!  The aroma is delicious but the flavor is just plain water.  To try to make up for the poor quality of the product and the money I wasted buying it, I tried filling the bottles for reuse with my own filtered water but it just tasted musty, like it was going bad...really bad.  So I ended up just recycling the nice bottles.  As far as flavor goes....there is not any flavor, none at all.  It turns out to be just an expensive way to drink bottled water.  Not worth it by any means.  I don't know how the other reviewers could come to different conclusions but in my opinion....this bottled water is a big waste of money and I will never be buying it again.

It has a great balance of protein, fats, and sugars that makes for a great snack before a workout or a great snack after a workout.<br /><br />P.S. Rise did not change the bar. I used to eat these all the time before Rise took over for Boomi. They have always had the whey protein, which is what drew me to the bar in the first place. Just wish they sold the cashew and honey protein + bar as well, I miss that.

review/summary: almost perfect
review/text: Rise got it right- almost.  First of all, only 3 ingredients- whey protein, almonds, and honey- is fantastic.  And they taste good- except they are just a little too sweet.  There's no need for 13grams of sugar.  They could have cut it in half quite easily in my opinion.  For this reason, I never eat a whole bar.  I usually use 1/2 a bar as a '2nd breakfast' after my morning workouts.  Because of the high sugar content, I can't justify the entire bar at once, so I take along some grilled chicken to round out the meal.  I feel the same way about all of Rise's bars.  They are delicious, clean, and convenient... but they overdo it on the sugar in every single one of their bars.  If you are as careful as I am about sugar (I stay at no more than 15-20grams/day) buy these with caution b/c a full bar will be your full day of sugar.  If you are not cautious about sugar, consider becoming so.

review/summary: Good bar. Too sweet for me.
review/text: This is one of the most nutritious bars out there.  Of course for anyone with health issues, I don't recommend bars at all, since they, by design, have too much sweetener in them.  American society can't seem to purchase anything that isn't sweetened, or is it that American food industry won't make anything that isn't sweetened.  The challenge even with the rise bar is that it is sweetened with Agave (and a bit too much).  Depending on the source of agave (specifically how much the provider has processed it), agave "nector" could have been turned into High Fructose syrup.  And, the rise bar doesn't need that much sweetener.  I think they are trying to make it taste like a sni***** candy bar (to sweet).  The rice already provides soe sweetness and perhaps some stevia or luo han guo extract would do well to give a nice taste.  And, since such a minimal amount would be required, it might even make the manufacturing cheaper once they modified the lines.  Who knows.  I just wish that companies like this would lead nutrition trends a bit more aggressively.  All the ingredients are nutritious, except the Agave (likely), by themselves, so start buying into the sweet-tooth brain-washing! The audience buying these bars are health-nuts - we don't want things to be crazy sweet.  With a little modification, I'd buy it again.  It was one of the only Carob bars on the market that I could find.

review/summary: That little bit of chocolate
review/text: My boyfriend put me on to Rise bars; particularly the protein because I'm a gym rat, and has earned himself the "best boyfriend ever" title for it.  I love chocolate and the carob chip fulfills that one vice whilst including the benefit of making sure I reach my protein requirement each day.  On days when I'm running late, extremely busy or don't want a meal before the gym, I will have one of these which kills of the hunger pangs and gives me that little boost for a 2 hour workout session without being heavy on my stomach.  Plus, I love that it's free of soy #phytoestrogens# and peanuts.  Although this bar is not all the way paleo, it's mostly there.  For the paleo's among us, try the Rise Almond and Honey <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VP1WA6">Rise Bar Protein Bar Almond Honey 2.1 oz. #Pack of 12#</a>

First I thought they were great, then they had some production issues and I thought they were inedible, now they seemed to have fixed the issues and they're really great again.<br /><br />These are the "cleanest" protein and 40/30/30 bar you're going to find.  Taste is pleasant--they're not too sweet for me (just nice hint of honey) and you can tell they're now using a high quality Whey Protein Isolate for the protein (FWIW, there's a "flavor" in there that's similar to Jay Robb unflavored Whey Protein Isolate--clean milky taste).<br /><br />In any case, I'm happy these are back and I'd think anyone who eats healthily in general would be able to feel the positive effects of this bar.

It is an easy way to get fiber into your diet without using one of the "cardboard" tasting cereals.<br /><br />3. Because this is high in fiber and protein, it is much more filling than other breakfast cereals.<br /><br />4. I like the crunchy taste, and the cereal does not get soggy in milk.<br /><br />5. This also works well as an in between meal snack without milk instead of eating candy, chips, etc.<br /><br />Shop for price. A 51 oz. box at my local Costco costs much less than the current price of eighteen dollars and fifty cents on Amazon, and an even lower price is available when Costco puts this on sale.

review/text: This is a lot smaller than I expected... The picture made it seem like there was going to be more substance.  It was okay, but I ended having to get another present for my Dad to go along with this. I wasn't pleased.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: Jelly Belly must have a real life Willy Wonka. These jelly beans taste exactly like their stated flavor, and not in the "Oh, banana? I guess this could be banana," kind of way. You can tell what flavor a bean is without checking the flavor chart that comes with it. All this without being sickly sweet. Amazing.<br /><br />The packaging was neat and clean and the jelly beans were fresh. (When they get old they get hard, that's how you know the difference.)

review/summary: Lake & Lodge K-cups
review/text: I was hooked from my first sip.<br /><br />Liking my coffee strong, I tend towards the dark-roasted or bold K-cups. Having tried many different brands, I've come to appreciate Green Mountain the most. I had previously been consuming their Dark Magic K-cups, but Lake & Lodge is my new favorite. It has a nice, nutty flavor with being acidic or bitter and it is incredibly aromatic when it's brewing.

review/summary: for fretting felines and canines
review/text: This 100% natural product for cats and dogs going through stressful times includes the same active ingredients as those for the relief of tension in some natural human formulas, like valerian and chamomile, and also apparently has a good taste, as a dropper full of the liquid in food is devoured with relish; it also includes passion flower and fructose, which is probably why it has a sweet aroma, and adds to the palatability. Other ingredients are hops, scull cap, and inert ingredients include deionized water and sodium benzoate.<br /><br />I've found it very useful on two occasions, once when trying to catch a young feral kitty, and secondly, to relieve the anxiety of my devoted eight year old Liddy when introducing the young cat into the household. Also good for pets that are nervous travelers, and those few animals that get upset when being groomed.<br /><br />Richard's Organics Pet Calm claims that it "Treats short-term stress", and in my situations, it has worked beautifully. Depending on the size of the dog or cat (1 dropper = 1 ml. / Up to 40 lbs., 1-4 ml. / Over 40 lbs., 3-6 ml.), there are a lot of doses in this 2 oz. bottle, and I think it's an excellent value.<br /><br />Liddy, Maggie and I are very satisfied customers of this product, which has made our lives easier and more peaceful.

review/summary: It's the 4th of July, I live behind a park, and dog is sleeping
review/text: Hopefully, my title says it all.  I have a very high-strung 2.5 year old herding breed dog.  Last year he was fine with thunder and fireworks.  This year, he's a mess.<br /><br />Yesterday, when I left his new bottle of Pet Calm at home and went with him to my mom's, he was trying to dig through the drywall, climb into my t-shirt, was panting, drooling, wide-eyed, and I could feel his muscles bunching and clenching.  His whole body was shaking.  The 3rd of July fireworks were driving him crazy.<br /><br />Today, on the 4th, I gave him Pet Calm (3 droppers and he's 50 lbs.) and wrapped him in an Ace Wrap (google search TTouch Ace Wrap dog instructions).  The fireworks are going off in the park right behind my condo.  My dog is calm, laying in the middle of the floor, looking not too concerned.  He does get up and move when there's a strong boom, but otherwise, he looks very calm.  He does not look dopey or drugged.<br /><br />I was about to go to the vet's and get Acepromazine or Xanax for him, but I don't think it will be necessary.<br /><br />I used the Pet Calm late last night without the Ace Wrap, and had the same resulting calmness and he slept in his own bed instead of under mine.<br /><br />Great product!  I'm stocking up!<br /><br />Side note: I do not think this product will work to calm a generally hyper dog.  If you have a young herding or other active dog breed, you'll still have to walk him, to the tune of him running sometimes over 20 miles a day (that's what my dog needs). Sorry.  This product just won't change a dog's overall energy level or behavior problems relating to it! :0)

review/summary: Side Effects?
review/text: I have a 25lb beagle that is a little over a year old. I had previously given 3 drops of the calming treatment but had seen no effect. Recently, a good friend of mine moved into my apartment and caused a bit of anxiety in my dog. I gave her 4 drops and she was fine for the rest of the night. The following day however, she was very lethargic and not very responsive to play and yawned an unusually large amount. As with the other review on this product, my dog also had muscle spasms or tremors. It was not really clear what they were. If purchasing this product, i would definitely be very careful with the amounts and see how dogs react. Honestly, i have been using pet naturals calming treats instead and they work just as well and have no side safest i have seen of.

review/summary: Pet Calm, Best thing out there.
review/text: This is one item I game across that has been a life saver ever since our Cavalier lost his hearing. At night time he would pant all night long, we tried bentadril, vet wrote an RX for anti anxiety medication and that didn't even work as well as this.<br />It is hard to find so I am very pleased to see it here. I have noticed that since we have been using it from the pet store they can't keep it in stock. This is a wonder drug without side effects and he loves it.

review/summary: Sodium Benzoate as a preservative in Pet Calm is a "no-no" and should be eliminated to reduce cancer risk to pets as in humans.
review/text: Product is great idea if the sodium benzoate could be eliminated and a safer substance like citric acid used instead. The risk of sodium benzoate serving as a perfect substrate for cancer to develop and grow is an unacceptable risk for pets and humans alike!

review/summary: Caution! ?
review/text: Here's my experience... We have an 80# Golden Retriever who gets overly excited when we have guests.  This doesn't exactly fit the "stress" problem that the product is designed for but we thought it might help calm him down a bit particularly when we have guests that aren't dog people and don't care for his enthusiasm. The dosage calls for 1-6 ml depending on weight with the max dose of 6ml for anything over 40#.  The first time we tried it we gave 5ml and saw no results.  Last night we tried again with 7ml (slightly over recommended dose).  Again there was no visible calming.  This morning the dog went with me for our usual jog and then back at the house he had some kind of seizure or tremors that lasted about 5 minutes with shaking and very limited, wobbly control of his back legs.  By late morning he was his usual self.<br /><br />So, admittedly we did not use exactly for the intended purpose and did slightly over-dose him although according to directions he could have had another dose after 6 hours and we only gave one.  I don't really know that the episode was caused by the product but we've never seen the problem before so it's very suspicious.  That's our experience... draw your own conclusions.

review/summary: Blue Angels & Cat
review/text: In San Francisco every October, the Blue Angels jets terrorize us by flying directly over our City.  My cat (15 yrs old) has always freaked out, hidden, & stopped eating.<br />I bought Pet Calm about 6 years ago & it works!  I add about 3 drops to his food, usually hours before the jets fly.  I make him a little "fort" to hide in.  This year, he actually went to sleep while the jets flew!  The only warning I'd give is to start with small doses, & use more if needed. I wouldn't want any pet to overdose, as Valerian root is a strong herb.<br />This is a GOOD PRODUCT!

review/summary: This is a great product!!
review/text: I live in an EXTREMELY NOISY neighborhood in Los Angeles and my little English Toy is terrified by helicopter noise (and these things buzz overhead 24/7, 365 around here) and just about every other form of loud noise (trash trucks, gardeners, street sweepers, tree trimmers, etc.)  I find that when he gets particularly stressed and I give him a dropper full of this stuff (which he laps up - it must taste very good but I have no interest in trying it), within about 25 minutes he's fairly chill (and usually ultimately falls asleep), and if I take him outside, his anxiety level is significantly reduced and he will even sometimes tolerate (ignore?!) the helicopters.  Really effective, safe, wonderful product.

review/summary: This is a good product if you don't want to dope up your dog.
review/text: Unfortunately i have a Great Dane so the dosage for what is considered a large breed always means I need to give a little more. But I am use to this dilemma as I'm sure any Dane or extra large dog breed owner is. other than that I find this product doesn't seem to make her dopey or drowsy rather just calmer, which is what i was looking for. In addition to increasing excersize this is great for separation anxiety treatment. I will be very happy to use this product regularly.
