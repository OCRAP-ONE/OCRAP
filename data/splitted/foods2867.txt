review/summary: Vermont maple syrup.
review/text: Well people these are a real welcome treat and taste very good indeed. The tuufiddy ml glass bottle was a bit bigger than i thought :-) (16,5 cm tall) None of my four time glass bottle`s had that cool paper card on the neck of the bottle, just the gold foil. There is a soft seal & cap on the inside of every white plastic cap wich may be used to keep it well, sealed! This white "short skirt" plastic cap looks good on the bottle once the gold foil is removed. Most have a golden sticker on the top of the cap with the grade type. Mine came packed with a good amount of big bubble wrap around them. As you may have noticed all these style bottle`s hold the medium amber type (second out of of the 4 grades/blends) The taste is vey rich and sugary with a very nice presence of aroma from what i would suspect is the maple tree! Also, you may want to get a 36 oz. "refill" tin of your own choice. At room temperature this stuff has about the same viscosity as fish oil, maybe a tad thicker..and it can even be freezed without it becoming "solid" just thick. Shelf life is very good. Uses: to be taken  internally ;-) at presence i just drink the stuff as i have yet to incorporate it into my waffles/pancakes and what have you...Recommended!

review/summary: Best Tasting and No Partially Hydrogenated Oils
review/text: The most delicious ice cream cones I've ever had (besides freshly made waffle cones). They actually have a real flavor to them which is opposed to most ice cream cup cones. I prefer ice cream cup style cones to sugar cones and these are my favorite. They also are the only brand I've seen that do not have any partially hydrogenated oils in the ingredients. Unfortunately, Amazon won't ship these to Alaska and they stopped selling these in the stores up here so I am thinking about buying a waffle cone maker.

review/text: This is a smoking deal for price compared to my local markets.  You must be sure you can eat them all though.  We had a few boxes go stale before we cold eat them.  These are safe for people with peanut allergies.  Most other cones are not.  Most all Let's Do Organic products are safe.  They ahve an amazing website that lists all allergens for all their products.  I am very impressed with the texture and flavor of these cones.  Just like the ones we grew up on that were not so healthy for us.  I may not buy them again just because we tossed a few boxes and that does away with the savings.  But great product!

review/summary: Disappointed in the last case!
review/text: I have been buying Let's Do Organic cones for a couple of years. I used to be able to get them at my local grocery store, but when they quit carrying them I went online to purchase them.  I love the cones, the taste and the fact that there is no partially hydrogenated oils, however...this last case I ordered was very disappointing!  The cones crack and basically just fall apart when you try to put even the softest ice cream in them.  I have already "wasted" probably two entire boxes out of the six I have opened. They don't hold up to any pressure. There were some cones already broken in the wrapper. I don't know if I just got a bad batch or where the problem originates, but these are a little expensive to not be completely happy with them. I really don't like throwing 2 to 3 cones away for every one that I able to delicately fill with ice cream. I guess I will have to look for another brand...I love ice cream cones too much to give up! I probably should have returned the remainder of my case, then maybe Let's Do Organics might have gotten wind of this issue so as to address my concern.  I rated it very low based on this last case I received and the amount of waste

review/text: I ordered these cones because my wife and I are tired of eating cones with hydrogenated oil which has been found (at last)to cause serious health problems.  We do not know why the FDA refuses to ban it altogether, but we have our suspicions.  When I ordered these cones , I wondered if they would taste good, for I knew my wife probably would let them sit if they did not. She is the one who pronounced them delicious, and I agree. We are really happy to have another food that won't result in ill health from eating it.

(A common problem in some fruit wines.)<br /><br />This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).<br /><br />For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid.

review/summary: It's not weak
review/text: I wanted to disagree with another reviewer that claimed this hot chocolate is weak. It is not. As long as you make the default size (about 7 oz.) it is great. I used to make my hot chocolate using nothing but milk and Ghiradelli Double Chocolate Cocoa Mix. This is also a great product, but no where near as convenient as Tassimo/Suchard hot chocolate. The Ghiradelli hot chocolate does taste better, but Suchard is of high enough quality that I now choose it for the convenience. The chocolate "milk" that is frothed up with hot water from the Tassimo does a decent job.<br /><br />Note #1: If you press the button that makes a larger cup it does so by adding more hot water. This will dilute the chocolate "milk" and produce a weaker beverage. (I know, this should be obvious.) Maybe this is what the previous reviewer was doing?<br /><br />Note #2: Check the pricing for a 2 pack versus the 5 pack. The 2 pack is often significantly cheaper.

review/summary: Best Hot Chocolate for Tassimo
review/text: I love this hot chocolate. It has a great taste - something you would expect from a coffee shop. It's not the best cup I've ever had, but it's pretty good. For the reviewers that are saying it's too chocolatey, I agree... sort of. My guess is that the Suchard makes it this way so the customer can add as much extra water as they want. And this is the key, you have to add more water to get a great taste. No, you shouldn't have to do this, but it's still worth it for me. I've tried the milka brand and you have to do the same thing, and I don't think that tastes good at all. I will continue to order this hot chocolate. With "subscribe and save", it's also a little cheaper too.

review/text: I wouldn't say this is the best hot chocolate ever, it's not the cheapest either. But, for anyone purchasing a Tassimo you are probably going for the ability to make a variety of drinks easily and this hot chocolate works in that regard.<br /><br />It is good hot chocolate, but it makes an even better mocha. If you take a Suchard disc and an Espresso disc, it makes a pretty strong mocha like drink. If you take a Suchard disc, a milk disc and 2 espresso discs it makes a pretty credible mocha drink as well.

If you do decide to try it, shake the livin' heck outa the disc for a while before you put it in the machine, it does make it a little stronger that way.  I'm waiting for a stronger version that makes more.

review/summary: Healthy cereal but causes bad gas!
review/text: The "Crunch!" with exclamation point is no exaggeration. This cereal is very crunchy, almost to the point of being too hard. Some people may describe it as eating rocks or cardboard, but I still have all of my teeth and don't mind the texture too much. This cereal will indeed give your jaws a good workout. For those who find it too hard, you can let it soak for a few minutes in milk to soften slightly.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the texture and size of the clusters. This is the one instance I can remember where the actual product looks better than the box art, which is usually enhanced to show texture. There are no blueberries in here, in case you are wondering. It's just an example serving suggestion.<br /><br />The taste is sweet, but not overly so. The taste of puffed rice is most dominant. But this cereal's biggest selling point is how healthy it is. Kashi espouses a philosophy and lifestyle of healthy eating, exercise, and relaxation (explained on the back of the box). It's low in sodium, all natural, and low in fat. Just 1 serving gives you 32% of your daily fiber (8g) and 14% of your protein (9g) with only 3g of fat (25 calories). The downside of all this, though, is that this cereal can give you a bad case of gas if you eat too much.<br /><br />As for the price, there's no point to buying this cereal from the current seller when you can just as easily run down to your local supermarket or drugstore and pick up a box for much less, unless you like wasting money. When it is on sale, I can get a 15 oz box from Rite-Aid for under $3. For those who want a healthy cereal alternative that isn't as hard, you can try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5RLI">Nature's Path Organic</a> cereal.

review/summary: Delicious and super crunchy, but really too sweet
review/text: I find the crunch and texture of this is very satisfying when you want to get your teeth into a granola-like cereal. The flavor is a melange of grains and of sweetness. It's reminiscent of sugar smacks--but richer and more healthful. :)<br /><br />I do wish they'd dial down the sweetness. Kashi has some very nice granola medleys and cereal products, but on some cereals--like this one and the Cocoa Beach granola--its sooooooooooooooooo sweet. Too sweet. I'm assuming most of the consumers of Kashi cereals are grown-ups, not kids. Well, grown-ups just don't need cereal to have this much SUGAR...er...let's call it "evaporated cane juice". (same diff, really)<br /><br />I'll give it five stars the day they ease up on the sweet stuff.<br /><br />But I'll still buy it. I just dilute with a bit of unsweetened wheat puffs or more milk or Almond Breeze.<br /><br />How appropriate that it's being sold by a store with CANDY in its name. (The shipping cost looks insane though;what up with that?)<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: A terrific breakfast cereal
review/text: I have eaten this for years both for breakfast as well as for a snack. This is not super sugary like the junk cereals aimed at children, and for me the sweetness is just right. Contrary to other reviews, this is not like eating rocks; the clusters of cereal are no harder than say almonds, and if you let them soak a minute or two in milk they become very soft. The taste is absolutely delicious.<br /><br />I have read reviews complaining about gas. If your diet is lacking in fiber and you eat any high fiber product, you are likely to have gas. However if like me you already have lots of fiber in your diet from fruit and vegetables, then eating this cereal will not give you gas.<br /><br />I usually have this cereal with some fresh fruit, and unlike low fiber cereals it is very filling.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a great way to start the day with breakfast, or just to have a healthy snack in between meals. It is also a good way to introduce fiber into your diet.<br /><br />Shop for price. I currently buy a 43 ounce size for about nine dollars at my local Costco.

review/text: You will not fart with every step you take if you eat this cereal. Circuit tweaker just needs some Activia. This cereal is amazing. It has a high amount of protein and keeps me full all day. I'll admit that it is pretty hard to chew sometimes, but delicious. I also wish they would cut back on the sugar. It can be too sweet for some.

review/summary: The main ingredient  for a perfect meal
review/text: Ronzoni's Enriched Ziti Rigati pasta makes for an easy dish to cook when you want a hot meal without a lot of fuss. It can also be the main ingredient for a meal that has pasta with sauce as part of a main course dish. The pasta remains quite fresh until any expiration date that is printed on the box; and each box contains enough ziti rigati for eight servings.<br /><br />The pasta is so easy to cook: just boil a pot of water; pour in the amount of the ziti rigati that you need; and stir for about 10 minutes. If you like your pasta a bit firm then cook it for about 8 minutes--watch it and take a taste test of just one piece of pasta if you have any doubts. Some people add a little salt while the pasta cooks; I personally don't add salt. I never noticed any difference between salted and unsalted because the small amount of salt that you're supposed to add makes no big difference.<br /><br />The pasta is very low in fat; and it contains no trans-fats--thank goodness! This pasta contains no cholesterol and no sodium, either. That's very good health news. It does contain carbohydrates as you may have suspected; but a single serving still keeps those carbs low at only 14% of the daily allowance of carbs. Great!<br /><br />Ronzoni states on the front of the box that this macaroni pasta is enriched; I assume they are referring to the Iron, Niacin and Riboflavin in the pasta. The pasta has 7 grams of protein per serving as well. In addition, this product is kosher if that matters to you.<br /><br />There are some caveats, however: this product contains wheat and it is made in a facility that uses eggs. If this is a concern for you please consult your doctor or nutritional expert.<br /><br />Have further questions? No problem. Just call Ronzoni using their toll free number or visit their website. They also provide you with a street address in case you wish to write to them.<br /><br />Overall, this ziti rigati by Ronzoni is the best out there! It's affordable; easy to cook and serve; and it doesn't pose any major health risks to the vast majority of people. I highly recommend this fine pasta.

Consequently,  I picked up a can Castor & Pollux Ultramix Puppy Formula and was delighted to find that it looks and smells like food that I might make to feed our new dog.  Ultramix has chunks of chicken, pieces of rice and other vegetables. The makers have changed my view of processed dog food.  It's a winner.

review/summary: One of a few commercial foods that my puppy will eat
review/text: My 3 months-old Yorkie puppy is a bit spoiled because I feed her ground turkey/beef at least once a day...and then I "attempt" to get her to eat dry dog food (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009YWKUK">Blue Buffalo Chicken and Brown Rice Puppy Food 6 lbs.</a>) for her other meal but she usually just plays with it when she starts getting hungry. It also takes her a good while to eat dry dog food because it looks like it's too hard for her little teeth to chew...<br /><br />I heated up a bit of this today and she happily ate a good amount before falling asleep. All of the ingredients (at least the first half) are natural meats, grains, veges, and fruits. I'm hoping that I can start mixing in some dry food with this to encourage her to eat a more nutritionally balanced diet.<br /><br />** UPDATE **<br />I can't change my rating on this item but I wanted to add that this gave her some serious problems the day after I wrote the review above. When I came home from work during lunch, she was pacing back and forth on my rug. A few minutes later, a stream of clear, mucus-y liquid squirted out from her rear end. It repeated every few seconds and I ended up on my knees, trying to catch her projectile squirts as she kept trying to walk away from me. Needless to say, I had to toss the remaining 80% of the can and she has never had another problem since.

review/summary: Bait and Switch?
review/text: I ordred this holiday assortment of coffee because my husband loves the eggnog version, which is really tasty, but hard to find when it isn't near the holiday season. This product was listed for $6.99 and I ordered it immediately.  My order for the keruig holiday assortment was canceled a few hours ago, and when I came back to see what happened, the same company is offering the product at almost six times the price!  Why was it offered for the lower priced then suddenly jacked up to over $40?!  I feel duped and cheated.  Don't offer a product at a price you have no intention of selling it for.  This is the first and only negative review I have written.  I usually let little things go, and figure there was a glitch or tech issue.  But, the product was listed at that price for multiple days.  Fair advertising is something I expect from Amazon and all its suppliers.  This was clearly misleading, and very frustrating.  I wouldn't be as aggravated, except I found the same product at a local store today for less than half the cost it is listed at now, but I didn't purchase it because I was expecting this order to arrive soon.  I know this isn't necessarily about the product specifically, but I think it is important for people to see the advertising policy this supplier used was misleading.  I will be buying my coffee supplies from other companies both local and online.  This instance has marred my trust with this supplier.

review/summary: Not What Was Advertised
review/text: Ordered this as a gift for someone.  The box was supposed to contain three holiday flavors of coffee: eggnog, gingerbread, and french toast.  There were supposed to be 16 of each flavor.  The box contained 16 of the french toast, and 32 of the gingerbread.  No eggnog in the box.  Unfortunately, the gingerbread flavor is not good.  A couple of folks tried the gingerbread and we found it had an aftertaste that is not enjoyable.  So, a wasted purchase as 2/3 of the box is not going to be used.  Not worth it.

Then the real shocker is the Golden French Toast.... it was the best of the bunch and it was the only one I didn't think I would like, well I was greatly mistaken.  The only Negative I have found is that they all look the same in the box.  My suggestion is that they need to change the tops to different colors so you can easily distinguish between the three.  Other then that this is well worth it!

review/summary: I love the Holiday Blend but its seasonal
review/text: Of the 4 coffee drinkers in our house, one person likes the gingerbread, another likes the french toast (supposed to be a maple syrup and cinnamon flavor), none of us like the egg nog, and ALL OF US LOVE THE HOLIDAY BLEND.  I tried to get it in a bag or just a box of k-cups, but Green Mountain doesn't sell them by themselves, had no bagged Holiday Blend left, and only made the variety box for the holidays for Bed Bath and Beyond, which is where I bought it for $20 minus the $5 coupon, so it was $15.  They need to sell this flavor by itself.  It's too much to buy this box of 48 for only the one flavor, but if it wasn't, I would have stocked up.  It is my favorite coffee of all.  If you prefer regular coffee, and not the flavored kind, this box of 48 would only be good for serving company and drinking the Holiday Blend for yourself.  If you like different coffee flavors, it's worth the try for the money, 48 for so little.

review/summary: Really?
review/text: So I am partly at fault for my poor raring. I had entered in the search for egg nog coffee and this popped up. I figured 48 Egg nog k-cups for 49.999 (which is what I paid here...of course today it is on sale) was kind of high however I was thinking it was just the egg nog, which is my favorite. It arrived (damamged I might add) and it is a combination of 3 flavors...2 of which no one in my house likes. What really is awful is I paid 50 bucks...this exact same box is at my local walmart for 25.99. The price is WAY too high...totally not worth it.

review/summary: Absolutely amazing flavor!
review/text: Green & Black's Organic Orange and Spices Dark Chocolate bar is for serious chocolate lovers only.  It has intense flavor that will make it difficult to go back to "standard" chocolate bars from makers like Dove and Ghiradelli.  G&B's bar tastes like an infusion of orange rind, light spices, and, of course, chocolate!  This bar melts in your mouth like no other and is more than worth the extra cost.<br /><br />A nice bonus is that this bar is Fair Trade certified, so you know that you're buying a chocolate bar that was purchased for a living wage to the farmers that grew the cocao.  I love all of G&B's products, and I think you'll like this one too!<br /><br />Keep in mind that in stores, one of these bars retails for ~$3.99.  At Amazon's current price, they're only $2.79 each.  Quite a deal.

review/summary: Amazing taste, excellent 'green cred'!
review/text: From my first bite, I was in love with Green & Black's Maya Gold! Both the orange & spices, as well as the chocolate are smooth and just intense enough. Nothing chunky, chewy, crunchy, or gummy in here! Just pure, fair trade, vegan goodness! The flavor is so delicious and satisfying that you can really get that 'chocolate relief' from one itty-bitty piece. The bars are so yummy, that you wanna eat more, though! We're always sure to have at least one bar in the house (although it does go quickly!) these 3-bar packs make it easier to share :)<br /><br />Yum!<br /><br />I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner. If you voted this as helpful, I Thank You! :)

review/summary: Cheap-tasting & Unremarkable
review/text: Perhaps my expectations were too high considering it was $4 at my store, and I really wanted to like this-- but it tastes extremely similar to one of those cheap chocolate oranges that come out around Christmas.  Nothing remarkable. The orange flavor was far too pronounced, and I hardly tasted any spices. I was hoping it would taste more chocolatey, with the orange flavor very subtle and nuanced. Unfortunately, it is the opposite. I don't really understand all the positive reviews here- but I think next time (if there's a next time?) I'll try a different variety in hope that I come away more impressed. In the meantime, my favorite bar of chocolate continues to be Lindt's dark chocolate with sea salt. Divine.

review/text: I am an avid dark chocolate lover. Not a lover of this one at all. This bar reminds me of Christmas because of it's intense spice flavor... like when my mom used to throw cinnamon, dried apple and any other spice she could think of in a pot of simmering water to fill the room with a 'holiday scent'. Way too strong to eat! This chocolate bar does not have a good spice flavor.. more like you are eating chocolate-covered potpourri. I don't really taste orange at all.  Just strong spice. Their other bars are much better.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: Although I am not normally a fan of chocolate with orange, I decided to try this bar, because it is both fair trade and organic. In fact, it is the ONLY fair trade item in the Green & Black's chocolate bar line, if that's important to you. I was pleasantly surprised by how well balanced the orange and spice flavors were. Neither one was pungent or overpowering to the chocolate. And, as is typical of Green & Black's products, the chocolate was creamy and had some "mouth melt" to it. One thing to note is that this bar has only 55% cocoa content, so it's sweeter than some of the other varieties. I gave it 4 stars because it's certainly better than average but not "to die for."

I have painstakingly sampled all of the flavors, and I can declare with satisfaction that they are all excellent. I pretend to myself that since it is "organic" and "dark chocolate" it is good for me, which I suppose it would be if I could limit myself to healthy amounts and not gorge myself as is my tendency. The flavors are appealing and varied - and I do particularly like the dark chocolate-orange combination. Try it and see for yourself

My favorite is Green & Black's dark chocolate with cherries, but this one is almost as perfect.

review/summary: Yummy, Addictive and Healthy Snack
review/text: These may be the best pretzels I've ever had. They're tasty AND healthy (bonus: They're organic). Good alone or with salsa, guacamole or a non-fat dips. Or add some apple or pear slices, a dollop of yogurt or some fresh veggies for a quick and healthy at-home or on the go snack.<br /><br />I first came across them in a desperate attempt to wean myself from baked white cheddar chips. Looking for something crunchy yet non-fattening wasn't easy. You get 15 pretzel sticks at only 130 calories and no saturated or trans fats. Works for me!<br /><br />Best of all, there's 4% dietary fiber in a serving. (About 8 servings to an 8-ounce bags, so we're talking about a week's worth of healthy snacks.)<br /><br />The honey wheat flavor is great and best of all, it's a satisfying snack, too.<br /><br />If you buy in bulk, be sure to hide away those other bags and count out portions. Otherwise, it's way too easy to overeat these pretzels.

review/summary: Good pretzel, if slightly sweet.
review/text: The problem with most pretzels is that they are white-flour bombs.  Lots of carbohydrate and not much else (other than a ton of salt).  Consequently, I have been looking for a good whole-grain pretzel.  These are pretty good.  The multiple grains add a variety and depth of flavor not found in plain pretzels, and you sure don't miss the extra salt.  Although they have a crunch, they are not so hard that my wife won't eat them.  They have only three flaws.  First, they are slightly sweet.  Although it is a subtle sweetness (which I suppose some folks like), I could do without it.  Second, white flour remains the number one ingredient, notwithstanding the multiplicity of whole grains.  Third, although they are low fat, they are not fat-free.  I am not sure why the bakers find it necessary to add oil to a pretzel.  Despite these shortcomings, these are a good--and healthier--alternative to standard prtezels, and much, much healthier than most other salty snacks.

It is priced a lot better than in the stores, if you can even find it in a store! It is a good product that myself and husband enjoy. If you like pretzels want organic and are looking for a slightly salty/sweet taste, then this is one you will enjoy too!<br /> This is an edit of my review as my last shippment of this product was not very good... the pretzels in this latest shipment have an odd taste to them...sad as they were so good tasting in prior shipments...I also see that you can not get this organic Pretzel anymore as it show as unavailable, this maybe is due to the problem I am having, perhaps someone else found this odd taste that wasn't there before so<br />I'd change my rating on this product now after the problem w/ this shippment I hope they fix the problem.

review/text: Snyder did it all right. (you used to be able to get these in the big pretzel size in my grocery store, but they are no longer available where I live) The pumpernickel is delish, the onion is very faint, but distinguishible, and the salt is just enough to get you all excited, but not too much to overpower the pumpernickel. The sticks are a fun shape to munch, and if you have company that likes to dip things these are a good size for that (no double dipping). Sticks are about 3 inches long.

review/summary: Yummy and delicious!
review/text: Zots are the best.  I used to purchase just a few to put in favor bags at my kids parties.  I splurged and purchased this big bag, just to have as a treat in our house.  I must say- they are so delicious!  My kids love them, as do my husband and I.  They won't last very long!

review/summary: The quintessential breakfast tea.
review/text: Given this blend's orgin, the name "English" Breakfast is a bit of a misnomer, because it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name "breakfast tea." It proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over Britain, many of which then added the word "English," which has been part of its name ever since.<br /><br />English Breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and China. Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday "work horse," and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee.

review/summary: A straight-ahead pleasure
review/text: This Twinings tea is a simple pleasure that never offends. It is sturdy enough to be enjoyed with milk or sweetener, yet has little harshness when consumed black.<br /><br />Twinings of London was founded in 1706, and is known internationally for marketing teas of consistency and value. Twinings English Breakfast Tea was originally blended to complement the traditional, hearty English Breakfast, from which its name derives. Twinings literature tells us that this is a blend of Kenyan and Assam black teas.<br /><br />This Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses only small particles that infuse more quickly than whole leaves. This blend approaches full strength within just a couple minutes. To avoid excessive particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.<br /><br />This product is a fine introduction to the world of loose tea, and an attractively priced pleasure. Would I rank it as my favorite tea or even my favorite Twinings? No, but I keep some available for when I want the pleasure of plain ol' tea. (As an aside, I would rank Twinings' Earl Grey a bit higher in quality. It is a whole leaf tea with just the right amount of bergamot orange flavoring. I personally don't think of Earl Grey as an everyday tea, but I enjoy it as an occasional pleasure.)
