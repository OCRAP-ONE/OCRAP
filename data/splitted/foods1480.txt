review/summary: Organic Green Puffs
review/text: My son has been taking the Happybaby cereal, and I was thrilled to know that they have started to make the puffs as well.  My son used to take the Gerber puffs but I have switched him to these organic ones.  He is OK with these.  However, I do not like the container as the cap opens too easily.  When my son throws the container or drops it, the cap opens and the puffs spill all over the floor.  We have wasted quite a fair bit of the puffs in this manner.

review/text: I read one of the reviews that says there is soy lecithin in puffs-I double checked the label on the container that lists ingredients. There is NO SOY, NO CORN and NO DAIRY. The puffs are great-USDA organic and the container is BPA-free. Nice choice for my little one:)

review/summary: they taste like styrofoam
review/text: I'm not sure why everyone is so crazy about these. My kid will hardly touch them, and i can't blame him. They taste like styrofoam. Maybe one in five tastes like styrofoam with a slight banana glaze. They do melt nicely in the mouth if you only eat one or two at a time, but if you shove a whole handful into your mouth, they dissolve into some sort of paste-like slag.<br /><br />Everyone's got different taste, and maybe my kid's just a little bit unusual, but these were a total flop. The only use we've gotten at all is using the container like a giant rattle.

I'm curious as to why anyone would pay $5-6 per container PLUS shipping here, when you can get them at Target or Vons for $2.99 or less. It is rare I find something on Amazon being sold for MORE than the competition. Shop elsewhere for these!!!

review/summary: Sweet flavor instead of Greens flavor
review/text: I try to buy organic when I can. These puffs received great reviews, and advertise their low sugar content. The "Greens" flavor made me think that... they will taste like greens! It seemed like a great find.<br /><br />Greens-<br />Well, there might be "greens" in these puffs but you sure can't taste any of it.<br /><br />What do they taste like?<br />They taste sweet- an outer coating of sweetness, followed by a rice puff flavor. I do not agree with another reviewer who says that they are "just like Cheerios".<br /><br />Sugar content-<br />They might have only 0.5g of sugar per serving, but compared with Cheerios this is still double the sugar (those have 1 in 28g). Not that Cheerios are the measure for all baby snacks, and they are certainly not organic, but they are at least not sweet tasting.<br /><br />Packaging-<br />You will receive a box with six plastic dispensers similar to the ones you get for wipes. Each container contains 2.1 oz (60 g) of rice puffs. The containers are so light you could think they are empty. The packaging is complete overkill.<br /><br />No wonder babies may like these- they taste sweet!

It was his 1st official "finger food" so I think it's a combo of, "I can do it myself" plus it tastes good, and dissolves easy in the mouth- which is kind of important when you only have 6 teeth! Only other mom-comment here is that I wish they had a little MORE greens in it, as it's not even close to green in color, like they just waved some greens over the bowl when making it. Someone ought to sell this stuff in a mixed case...we go thru about one container every few days.

The puffs get stale quickly and the lid on the container pops open easily, so I've had them spill all over my diaper bag and the floor.  So I had to tape the lid shut, and eventually transferred them to another container.  But the puffs themselves are great, if she likes them who cares if they taste like nothing to me!

review/summary: Great for this family
review/text: My 7 month old loves this flavor. He's just started really feeding himself last month and I've tried some other brands. Most were too firm to properly "melt" without chewing. I know, because I personally tried them before giving them to him. I looked over the ingredients before purchase. (Apparently, some of the other reviewers on here did not. Their problem, not yours/ours.) It says in red letters on the container for this flavor, just below the ingredient list: "Contains wheat. No dairy. No corn. No soy." It also says that of the flavors, only Strawberry and Sweet Potato are gluten free. If you're concerned about ingredients in the foods you give your child, it's probably a good idea to read the ingredients first.<br /><br />The initial taste is a touch sweet, followed by a mild toasted flavor. Kix is the same way, only many times more intense. I like that if you just put them in your mouth and provide moisture and pressure they dissolve easily. I also like that they have the choline, and are sweetened with juice not sugar. Even if my son hated these, I'd probably snack on them myself. LOL.<br /><br />There you go. Bottom line, we both like them and hope to try the other flavors as well.

review/summary: Not an item to buy in bulk for my little guy!
review/text: My son was eating a good amount of these puffs when he was first exploring finger foods.<br />We loved them because they are a perfect size for him to pick up and put in his mouth as he developed his pincer grasp.  I was able to buy them in bulk one time before this and he ate the entire 6 containers!  Woo hoo!<br /><br />Now, as he nears his 1st birthday and his food options continue to broaden, he refuses these puffs.  I'm going to continue to offer them to him, but it is disappointing that he has dismissed them considering I have 5 more containers waiting for him.<br /><br />Definitely a "teachable moment" for this first-time mom.  Most likely I'll end up giving away the uneaten containers.<br /><br />On a related note, unless your baby eats a lot of these a day, I've noticed they go stale rather quickly too.  When he was really into these puffs it would still take him a week to get through a container, and they'd be stale only a few days into opening them.

review/text: I LOVE these snacks.  Okay, not for me, for my son.  He's now 16 months and has been eating them for at least 6 months.  They are great first snacks when baby has no teeth to chew because they melt in your mouth.  They are light and airy and really easy for baby to eat.  My son recently got some his molars and wouldn't chew anything.  It's was down to yogurt and the puffs.  They worked beautifully.  At this point, he's got enough teeth that I'm upgrading him to a little bit more crunchy food, but these puffs have been great.  We've tried the banana, apple and green and he likes them all.  Only bad thing is that they go stale REALLY QUICKLY!!! Gotta keep them in the container.  If you put them in a snack cup, they will be stale in less than 12 hours. They turn chewy and not so good.

I read the back of the package and it says "for best results eat within a week". There's no way my baby could eat all that in a week, so I ended up either transferring them to a more airtight container or putting them in a ziploc bag.  Hopefully that will keep them fresher longer.

He often seems discomforted by the irritation and pain.<br /><br />That said, crunchiness has often provided some soothing for him.<br /><br />While these aren't terribly crunchy after about half a second, he always seemed happy jamming them into his mouth and biting down.<br /><br />Once regular solid foods were introduced he pretty much gave up on these. I'd say the were good from 7-10mos for him.<br /><br />We went through about a dozen containers during that time.<br /><br />The containers, btw, make great bowling pins and robot arms afterward!

review/summary: Meets baby's approval, hence it met ours
review/text: Simply put, my daughter has decided to stuff as many as possible into her mouth at once, which signifies how much she enjoys the product.  We also now need to teach her patience, slight portion control techniques ("One at a time, sweetie!" works fine, thankfully!), and taking one's time to enjoy their food.  :)  Here are our thoughts:<br />1) Lightly sweetened, when compared to other brands and flavors.  In fact, I'm pretty sensitive to over-sweetened foods, and I likened these to regular Cheerios with a hint of sugar and other flavors.<br />2) I'm able to interpret the toughest of often-unpronouncable ingredients found in many "food" products these days, but that's just me since it has a tie to my current occupation.  So, I was surprised at how simple and straightforward the ingredient list is; I'd encourage purchase of this organic product based upon that alone (assuming that the company is truthful in its advertising).  Although our child appears to eat whatever is placed in front of her (this is her daddy's sense of adventure already poking through), I'm not worried about her getting enough greens into her developing body; however, if your child is fussy about veggies, this could be a nice substitute until you find a more creative way to blend in greens into the child's diet (current articles appear to lean more towards "trickery," "disguising," and "entertaining" the child when it comes to getting them to eat foods which we ordinarily would have had forced down our throats -so to speak- when we were little!).  This product may partially solve that issue.<br />3) Like competitor brands, this product does "melt" into a newly teething baby's mouth within an appropriate amount of time whether it's chewed or sucked upon by the baby, rendering it less of a choking hazard if you're concerned about that as we once were.<br />4) The container itself contains more product per container than do its competitors, which is quite nice.  Depending upon where you purchase a competitor brand, this one may be slightly higher per ounce, but it's worth it.  We don't forsee a need to purchase another case until 1-2 months pass.<br />5) The containers themselves are rather durable.  Unless your child is body-slamming it to the ground or you're stepping on it with all your weight, don't count on it shattering easily at all.  Plus, it's conveniently recyclable, and the opening is not too flimsy and snaps closed well enough.

Not only are they (to my knowledge the only) organic puffs, but they also have a fraction of the sugar compared to other brands.<br /><br />My baby loves the green, banana, and apple flavors. I've tasted them too (I couldn't resist), and they're not too shabby. After all, I would never feed anything to my baby that I couldn't stand to eat myself.<br /><br />As far as the quantity goes, I was at first wary of buying a 6-pack. However, my baby loves these so much, that we'll definitely use them before he outgrows them or they expire.

review/summary: Satisfied.
review/text: I read a review that said some will have almost no flavor and some will have a lot. This hit the nail on the head. Grab a handful and eat them one at a time. Some are bland like a Cheerio and some are almost sour, like jarred banana baby food is. That being said, flavor is not much of an issue. I don't see parents lining up to eat their kid's pureed peas. It's about what is better. I really don't like ANY food going into my baby's system that has a paragraph long list of ingredients that sound more like a science experiment with a recipe, but I feel better about these puffs than the Gerber ones. Also, I bought this at Target instead of from Amazon.

review/summary: The best puffs out there
review/text: I searched and searched for puffs (or any baby/toddler snack item) that didn't have sugar in it and this is one of the only products I have found.  It is sweetened with apple juice.<br /><br />My 9-month-old baby has been eating these for a few months now, she loves them!  In fact, I have to keep myself from eating them by the handful.  Much better than cheerios.

review/text: I care for a baby who absolutely loves these puffs. Perfect for his little hands and growing desire to feed himself. In fact, he loved them so much that I decided to try them myself. They're a satisfying snack, and only 25 calories a serving, so they win in my book for a grown up light snack as well. My only complaint is that they do not seem to have much kale or spinach in them at all. I definitely consider them as more of grain with little to no veggie content.

The veggie puffs do have a slightly sweet taste (similar to the apple), but it still has a hint of veggie flavor. I say it's worth a try to see if your kids like it! (and the value pack seems like a lot at first, but they have lasted a us such a long time!)THESE ARE NOT GLUTEN FREE THERE ARE OATS AND WHEAT IN THEM!

review/summary: Gave them a whirl and they're all right
review/text: I didn't want to buy them in bulk before trying them out. I've been sorry before.<br /><br />I found these newly stocked at my local SW and gave a few to my 8 mo. He totally went for them. He's no where close to being considered picky, and he loves to feed himself.<br /><br />I tried some and they really are bland. They only had sweet potato, so that's what I am reviewing the taste of, but they are for babies. Babies are ok with bland. I wouldn't mind snacking on these. They don't make a mess like his Earth's Best teething crackers so that's a plus with me for sure. And even Cheerios make a wee bit of a messs. These are mess free, unless he gets greedy and shoves a ton in his mouth and spits them out again...a slobbery mess of soggy rice. That's only happened once and that was his older bros fault.<br /><br />I'll stick with Cheerios for at home and have these on hand for in the car to keep him occupied on long trips. Good compromise.

I think I will have to put a peice of masking tape on the next container.  I do wish there was no sugar in them, but it does have much less than other puffs.  I like the organic ingredients of course.  And the price w/ subscribe and save is cheaper than convetional products at the store.

review/summary: Good product, packaging could be better
review/text: We have tried both the apple and greens flavors and my 12 month old son loves both-- has been eating them since 8.5 months. They dissolve quickly, so no real fear of choking or serious gagging (my little guy has a stronger gag reflex than most kids his age). The product itself is okay tasting-- sort of akin to a rice cake with a little sweetness? My son seems to think they're terrific and pursues them with almost the same vigor as he does his yogurt melts (also by Happy Baby).<br /><br />My only real complaint is the package itself-- the top pops open really easily. I had one open in my checked luggage on a trip once (oh that was fun), then another time when I had a container in the diaper bag for the day (two separate containers, so it was not just one faulty package). By that time I learned my lesson. I actually put the puffs into a Tupperware container after I initially open, because the package does not make a very tight seal (as evidenced by repeated opening) and they seem to go stale quickly.

review/summary: Great in theory, not so good in taste
review/text: I bought these because I was looking for an alternative to Gerber puffs for several reasons, including the sugar content and their corporate parent. These had good reviews so I decided to give them a try.  Good:  organic, not made by large corporate company, low sugar and all natural. My complaints are the following: 1) they taste stale right out of the package.  My baby probably doesn't know the difference, but to me the texture is soggy and chewy. 2) They don't taste like anything. Yes, I know I wanted less sugar but I assumed they'd taste like something! I bought the apple variety, so perhaps another flavor would be more interesting but these seriously taste like nothing.  3) the top doesn't stay closed very well.  AS I mentioned earlier, they come out tasting stale from the get-go, but the fact that the top doesn't stay shut very well makes them ridiculously stale within days. Unfortunately I cannot recommend these.

review/summary: Used to be great...until they changed the recipe
review/text: We'd been getting Greens Puffs for a while now for our 12 month old, and he used to love them - in fact, he couldn't get enough of them. However, based on our most recent shipment, the puffs are now smaller and mostly have a much thicker green powder coating than they used to. I gave my son the new puffs, hoping he'd like them just as much, but alas, now he really doesn't like them. He'll take a bite of a few, and then he just starts throwing them on the ground. I tasted one to see what the difference was, and honestly, I don't blame him for not liking them.  They have a sort of citrus flavor, and do have a really odd smell, almost like seaweed or seaweed flavored foods. I used to have a subscription for these, but I've cancelled it and now I have a box of six containers of these puffs that I don't know what to do with. Happy Baby shouldn't have messed with a successful formula. I used to like that he was getting something a little different, but we're just going to stick with Cheerios from now on.

review/summary: HappyBaby Organic Puffs-Banana is GREAT!
review/text: Wow! I had no idea how many different flavors HappyPuffs had!  We came across the 'banana' flavor recently and it is just as good as all of the others, from Apple, Greens, Sweet Potato and I've even seen Strawberry!  Banana though seems to be my little one's favorite right now, she's big into signing and seems to like banana everything! Banana puffs are a huge hit, the "banana, mango, peach" pouch too!  These truly do melt in her mouth which makes me comfortable with giving these to her.  I compared these with cheerios and there are a ton more vitamins and even digestion aids even in puffs which are perfect for a toddler.  With significantly less sugar then other puffs or cereals, being organic and safe to eat, these are a huge hit!  I also appreciate the amount of puffs we get in a container for the price, it's a great deal.  I have been even using the left over plastic containers for storage when we are done!  They are great little containers for crayons too on the go!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NXHY8Y">HAPPYBABY Organic Puffs, Banana Puffs, 2.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Great tasting!
review/text: These Apple Puffs are my son's favorite flavor! And he is 5! We actually all snack on them. The Apple ones taste perfectly sweet to me, perhaps because we consume little to no sugar on a daily basis, so we can tell these are naturally sweetened, nothing artificial. Being organic and half the sugar content of some other Puffs are some of the reasons why we continue to purchase these. The list of ingredients is short and all things I can pronounce and identify!<br />Snacking is a huge part of a toddler and young child's world, so if my son enjoys these then I am happy with that. It's also great to have these around the house for when my friend's with younger kids come over. It's the perfect snack to offer! Give them a try and I don't think you will be disappointed!

Babies do not need added sugar,so this is the perfect on the go snack.  Even my 6 year old likes the product.  Another great option by this company.

review/text: i personally prefer these PUFFS over any other brand because they are organic and have measurably less sugar. i also like the container because it is recyclable, and the lid serves double-duty as a small bowl to serve my tot his PUFFS. my husband and i made the decision when we became parents to always serve our children the most natural, best quality & cleanest foods available to us, even if it meant making/growing our own, or paying a little bit more. these PUFFS fit the bill: completely natural ingredients, no pesticides, no chemical fertilizers, no genetic modifications, and no preservatives. check the labels and see how these PUFFS make every other brand pale in comparison. it makes me happy when my little guy is happy and when he snacks on these PUFFS he is one "happy baby" :) these are a staple in our pantry.

review/summary: Still a Favorite!
review/text: HAPPYBABY Organic Apple Puffs are still a favorite of my daughter's, even after almost two years!  She just can't seem to get enough of them, and I feel great about giving them to her because I know that they are organic and so much healthier than other snacks she could be eating.  They are surprisingly filling, so one container will last us awhile (less so now that she is older, but still a great deal for what we are getting).  I am a big stickler about limiting sugar, so these definitely fit into my personal agenda and I don't know what I would do without them because to me there is nothing else out there that even comes close.  They are perfect for an on the go snack, and my only problem is the fights that often break out between my almost 3 year old and her 6 year old sister who also loves them!!

review/summary: Just can't get enough
review/text: Love...love...love HappyBaby products and these Puffs are no exception.  I never would have thought my little ones would go for the green puffs (spinach and kale), but there is just enough sweetness to keep them going back for more and more.  My husband and I try to eat and keep as much as an organic household as possible, but it is really difficult with baby products.  I feel like with baby food you are either spending tons of money or sacrificing taste.  Happybaby does neither...I think the price is in line with all other baby products (and usually Happybaby gives you more food per container) and the taste is amazing. I will definitely be buying this again along with some other Happybaby products.

review/summary: Great for young toddlers!
review/text: When my toddler was transitioning to table foods, these were a huge hit.  She's always been on the picky side, but she's never had a problem with these.  We tried all the flavors and each one was a hit with her.  They don't have as much sugar as the Gerber Puffs, yet they are still pleasantly sweet.  They dissolve easily and my little one never gagged or choked on these.  I initially wasn't a fan of the price of these puffs - however - the container surprisingly holds a decent amount of these and it lasted quite awhile.  The ingredients and the fact that these are organic is also cool.  I know this is lame, but I'm actually sad I won't be buying these anymore as my 23 month old toddler is outgrowing them.  (They made the "baby shelf" in my pantry look so cheerful.)

They compare in price to the other sugar/sodium-laden puffs and are much healthier for your little one.<br /><br />We have not tried the other flavors.  We did start her on the green flavor (kale, etc.) and to be honest...it really has no flavor, which is good if you're wanting to start them on learning to chew and mash.

review/text: I'm a regular purchaser of a variety of happy baby puffs, and the Banana flavor are usually a safe bet and my son really likes them (Strawberry is still his favorite).  Buyer beware though, this most recent order for the Banana flavor came and it seemed that the sealing process was fowled on 4 of the 6 packages in the box.  Puffs absorb moisture like no other so exposure from a poor seal on the container meant stale puffs.  Will this prevent me from purchasing again?  No.  Usually my puff orders are problem-free so give them a try.  I'm sure your kid (and you!) will love them!

review/summary: My son LOVES these!
review/text: Just amazing! My son actually laughs, smiles and waves his arms and legs around when he sees the container! These are the ONLY thing to give to a baby for their first "hard" food. They dissolve easily, and are very easy for a little one with only a few teeth to practice chewing. They are also good for the dexterity and learning to pick up (pinch) the little bits. I give them to my son to keep him busy while I make his meals. It's like the instant gratification as soon as he hits the high chair. The ones in the supermarket are full of ingredients I would NOT give my baby and these I can feel good about giving them to him. The Green are great, as well as the sweet potato and banana. Buying them on Amazon, I save money AND they come right to my door- the next day no less! They should be called HAPPY MOM!

review/summary: The favorite finger food.
review/text: I will say I prefer the taste of the Green Puffs to the Banana Puffs but they are also well received by my little one.  I think that the mix of banana and apple winds up a net neutral somehow.  As with most things, I would probably pick up a single canister to make sure that your little one is a fan before getting a pack.  They definitely "melt" in baby's mouth so my 8-month-old has no problem chewing them herself.  They are bigger and easier to grab than Cheerios so she is able to (and loves to) feed them to herself.<br /><br />I am soooooo happy that they use apple juice concentrate rather than other sweeteners.  They are the only puffs I've found that sugar or corn syrup or any other sweetener isn't the second ingredient.  They definitely taste like cereal (rice, oats and wheat are the first three ingredients).<br /><br />I have found that the containers I've purchased are always full (within an inch of the top, likely from settling), so I'm not sure where the reviewers that say the containers are too large are coming from - maybe they got a bad batch?<br /><br />Definitely, one of the best finger foods I've found so far.  Easy to grasp, light (3 puffs per calorie), no sugar, no syrups and all organic.

review/summary: Can't say enough!
review/text: I think that the listing has an outdated description as they now use apple juice concentrate rather than cane juice for the sweetener.  Both those I've purchased on Amazon and at the store are sweetened that way.  They are lightly sweet, but they are the only puffs I've found that sugar or corn syrup or any other sweetener isn't the second ingredient.  They definitely taste like cereal (rice, oats and wheat are the first three ingredients) but it's nice that they've blended in a little bit of veggies versus everything else that is either super fruit intensive or cheetos-lite.<br /><br />They are very light, but the canisters are completely full - I'm not sure why some others thought they were too big, maybe they got an off batch?<br /><br />They definitely "melt" in baby's mouth so my 8-month-old has no problem chewing them herself.  And they are bigger and easier to grab than Cheerios so she is able to (and loves to) feed them to herself.  By far the best finger food I've found.<br /><br />With Mommy's occasional snacking here and there (they are really good and there are three puffs to 1 calorie), I found the six pack to be a good amount.  But as with most things, I would probably pick up a single canister to make sure that your little one is a fan before getting a pack.

review/text: We started with the Gerber puffs from our local grocery store when our son was 7 months old.  I prefer organic products but our local grocer did not carry this item so I took the plunge and ordered these after reading the good reviews.  I'm so glad we made the switch!  These containers are larger at 2.1ozs than the Gerber Puffs at 1.48ozs, so not only are you getting a healthier product for your child - you're actually saving money!  If you do a side by side comparison on ingredients and nutrition this product is by far superior.  And they do taste great - even my 7 year old that avoids green vegetables thinks these are yummy.  We're keeping these on our subscribe and save list - thanks Amazon for offering a great product at an incredible price. :)

Zatarains has a different taste, so I actually like them both (and Z's is easier to find)  But the smooth tasty sauce is the key to this product.  I also like Popeye's RB&R, and this has a similar saucy goodness.  It's really good with sausage, particularly some Hillshire Farms Lit'l Smokies mixed in!

review/summary: Worst rice mix I've ever had.
review/text: I'm from the South, and one day my ma cooked some Zatairain's Red beans and rice. Mmmm, delicious. So, a few days ago I got this Mahatma mix. I don't like Mahatma's white rice, but I liked their Long and Wild Rice mix, and have had their yellow rice a few times, although it is sort of bland in large amounts. I wish I had gotten Zatarain's now, because this stuff was edible, but the spices in it are rank. It's almost a bitter taste. I tried a little bit with some hot sauce, and it was awful. I don't think anything can fix this rice. I sometimes mix pintos and basmati together, and that tastes better than this. Although, one time I mixed black beans and basmati, along with some other things and that was worse than this, so this isn't the worst rice I've ever had, but it is the worst mix.<br />I'd recommend going with one of these instead:<br />� Mahatma Long/Wild Rice mix<br />� Lipton mixes(I like Herb/Butter and Long/Wild the best)<br />� Zatarains Red Beans and Rice

review/text: I was nervous after reading some of the reviews about the taste of this and/or quality, but after having been consuming this for a couple days, I really do enjoy it!  Initially I thought it would be gross, but it really wasn't!  It is nice with the fruit in it, and has a kind of "nutty" taste. Great shipping, great quality, amazing nprice, and I def. rec!

review/summary: Best for my Boxers!
review/text: I first found these at a local pet food store, but they are almost $4 there!  So this is a GREAT deal.<br /><br />My boxers love these, they chew on them, play tug with them, bury them, dig them up, toss them in the air and spend hours chewing on them.  By far the best chew I have found for my pups!  {these are LARGE boxers with strong chewing skills!}<br /><br />The ONLY reason this is a 4 star instead of 5 is that they come individually wrapped in plastic... BOO.<br /><br />I also take these and give them as gifts when visiting friends with a new dog!

review/summary: Merrick miss porky chews
review/text: These were a terrific buy at a little over a dollar apiece after I spent over 3 dollar apiece in the store, but my dogs got kind of tired of them, so I really space them out. Usually they would last a week or better before I threw out the stubbies. They are puffed so they sound a little cardboardy when they chew on them. But the price with free shipping was very cheap compared to single purchase locally.

review/summary: Not a good tea!
review/text: I did not enjoy this tea at all.  First of all, I could not taste any tea.  All I could taste was the strong artificial perfume that was heavily infused.  The tea made me sneeze like crazy!  Will not purchase tea from this company again.

review/summary: Great for espresso or AeroPress
review/text: If you enjoy a good, rich, french roast coffee, then this is definitely the coffee for you. I actually have tried this coffee brewed in several different ways. I'll go with the bad news first. The grind on this coffee is quite fine. Therefore, do not purchase this pre-ground coffee if you are going to be using a french coffee press, such as Bodum, unless you want to end up with a lot of sediment at the bottom of your coffee cup.<br /><br />That is the only negative thing I have to say. The flavor of this coffee is excellent. (It tastes a lot like the old Starbucks' coffee used to taste, without the bitterness, before they went with their new, "let's compete with McDonald's blend" - yuk!) Because the grind is fine, it works great as espresso. It also works great in drip coffee makers with a paper filter (if you use a gold metal filter, you may end up with some sediment in your coffee), and because the grind is fine, you may find yourself using less coffee to make a full pot.<br /><br />However, the best way to enjoy this coffee, bar none, is by using it with the AeroPress Coffee and Espresso maker (this is a great, inexpensive gadget you can use to make both coffee and espresso). The flavor is bold, but smooth, with no hint of bitterness at all. Simply awesome.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GXZ2GS">AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a><br /><br />UPDATE 5/24/2011: After just receiving another order of this coffee I can happily report that even over 2 years since my original review, the quality and taste of the coffee is as good as ever. Just delicious, rich, dark and smooth, with no bitter aftertaste. One thing I noticed in this latest shipment is that the grind on the coffee is coarser than it has been in the past. I would say the grind now is a classic, drip grind consistency and texture. Which means my comments about not using it with a French Press Coffee Maker no longer apply. If you would still like to use it for espresso, I would suggest running it through a coffee grinder for a few seconds to make the grind more fine. I, personally, still use and love the AeroPress Coffee maker for this coffee.

review/summary: It's a Gas
review/text: Our little dog really likes this food, she gobbles it up. However...<br /><br />I can't think of a delicate way to say this, so I'm just going to say it. It gave her really bad breath and toxic flatulence.

review/summary: "It's got oatmeal so it must be good for you"
review/text: Well, that's my excuse anyway.  Actually, if one has a weakness for cookies and other sweet foods, these are a good choice.  There are pluses in the oatmeal and in the raisins.  Pair it with an apple or a cup of natural apple sauce and you have a very healthy and satisfying dessert or snack. These are even tastier if they are warmed slightly -- not much, just a wee bit.
