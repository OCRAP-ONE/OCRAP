review/summary: Good Peach Iced Tea
review/text: This is good peach iced tea.  If getting tired of Lipton Diet Peach tea, it is nice that Crystal Light is totally a different Peach Iced Tea taste.  Making it with slightly less than 2 Quarts of water seems to bring out the peach flavor, while if I use exactly or over 2 Quarts water then it just tastes sweet with no peach flavor.  When filling with water, fill to about two inches below the pitcher's spout.  I bought this when it was on sale on Amazon, but it is really expensive when its not on sale.

review/text: I find diet Snapple Peach Tea drink mix a noticeably better tasting product.  The peach and tea flavors are stronger, the drink looks and tastes less watery, and there's no chemical aftertaste.  If price rules out Snapple, consider peach-flavored Lipton diet iced tea mix.  I see that Amazon reviewers rate the taste comparable to Snapple, and it costs less than Crystal Light.

review/summary: not so good
review/text: I ordered a case of this product.  I think it was bad or something.  The outer and inner packaging was discolored, however, the expiration date was fine.  I opened several of the larger containers and chose random smaller containers to open, mix and taste test.  All of them tasted the same; weak/watered down in 'peach tea' flavor.  I was too disappointed with the product to keep it so all the remaining product was pitched.  I am an avid Crystal Light drinker so this experience will not deter me from drinking these products, but I think I'll stick to paying a bit extra and buying this flavor(in pitcher size)from my local store instead. Otherwise, I am usually very satisfied with my bulk orders of Crystal Light(and other products)from Amazon.

review/summary: High Quality Vanilla Chai at a Good Price
review/text: I asked for and received this tea as a Christmas gift.  I wanted a full bodied, loose vanilla chai and this seemed like a good value.  First, as you'll hear all the time, there is no comparison between a loose tea and the kind you get in bags.  This seems especially true in the case of chai.  The Octavia Vanilla Chai uses both black tea and Rooibos for a lower caffeine blend but it doesn't lose anything in terms of flavor.  There are whole spices and pieces of dried vanilla bean which give the tea a rich, bright flavor with just the right amount of spice without being abrasive.  The vanilla aroma is strong but not overpowering and the flavor is not artificial as is the case with other vanilla teas I've tried.  The Octavia tins are easy to open and do a good job of keeping air from degrading the tea.<br /><br />As with all chai, the tea benefits from a dash (or more) of milk.  I like my tea strong and fairly sweet so for this tea I generally brew two thirds of a 16oz. mug using about two teaspoons of tea and top off the mug with milk and a teaspoon of honey.  I use water that has just reached boiling to avoid scorching the tea or boiling too much oxygen out of the water, and I allow the tea to steep for 5 minutes before removing the leaves and adding the milk.  Which tea you enjoy will always be personal preference, but at this price point and quality this vanilla chai is definitely worth a try if you enjoy the flavors.

review/summary: Not good
review/text: I am no tea snob, but have enjoyed lots of Chai's available in the grocery store, and thought I would step up. This was not it. First, I was a little put off by how moist (damp) the product seems. Not sure if it is related, but it leads to a really weak cup of tea. I also so of get a musty aftertaste. Just too much emphasis on the additional flavorings, and not enough on the tea. A real disappointment.

Love being able to buy them in bulk like this as I make a lot of casseroles so not having to run to the store is a real plus.. Amazon has become my second store and I don't have to waste gas driving into the city all the time.. Being in a rural area with only 2 small grocery stores Amazon has really been a great boon to myself and many of my neighbors and friends.. Also, with several of us being seniors it's nice having some things delivered right to the front door.. Now when I need pasta, I know Creamette will be able to supply my needs.. I highly recommend them!

I'll figure out what to use it in, probably salad dressings<br />but definitely not for dipping.<br /><br />For my money, the red tin "Pure" Carbonell has a much better flavor and more<br />utility. Its also half the price if you can find it. 3 Pits

review/text: Unlike the other reviewer, I find this coffee to be simply amazing. I, too, am an American and I have NOT grown up on the coffee. It was a chance finding for me when a friend and I ran out of coffee and this was the only thing available at the store near our apartment. Since that chance finding, all we have wanted to drink is this particular coffee.<br /><br />I have never tasted a coffee so smooth in my life! It really is delicious. And I feel the cardamom adds a wonderful, lingering aftertaste. You really will be hard pressed to find a smoother coffee. I have converted some non-coffee loving friends into having a cup when they come over to my place simply because this coffee tastes amazing.

review/summary: healthful snacks for the kids and no more stale cereal in the house!
review/text: I will definately be ordering these again.  These were a bit hit with my family and with me. These cereals are great for the kids to throw into their backpacks for a mid-morning snack. They also throw them in their sports bags for an after school snack.  When I jump in the car for an appointment, I can grab a couple of these myself. My kids are eating these rather than chips or doritos so its a great, healthy option for them. I never had the Total or Total Raisin Bran before but I tried them and I really like them both.  I am really happy that I don't have boxes and boxes of stale cereal in the cupboard anymore. I used to look at that shelf in the cupboard and think of how much money we wasted buying cereals only for the cereal to go stale. It makes better sense to buy through Amazon for about 50 cents a serving and keep the waste to a minimum.

review/summary: Amazing Quick Healthy Breakfast, and Vegan!
review/text: Original Mix (I prefer this one because there is no added sugars)<br /><br />Taste:<br />In a green smoothie: Changes the texture of the smoothie just a bit, nothing too noticeable or annoying.  Also adds a different flavor to the overall smoothie that helps enhance the taste when combined with the right greens and fruits.<br /><br />With Almond milk: I am not used to eating sugars and processed foods, so this actually tastes pretty great to me. I saw some earlier reviews complaining about taste and I honestly have no problem slowly sipping on this shake as I drive to work in the morning. I have tasted some horrid protein shakes in the past and this one is delicious!<br /><br />Overall Feeling:<br /><br />I feel fantastic after having Amazing Meal in the morning. Completely clear minded and energized for the day. Even without the accompaniment of a multivitamin, this meal powder stands alone in providing a days worth of energy and clear minded thinking.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I found that I needed to get used to the added probiotic that is apart of the meal. I found myself for the first four or five days, starving only 2 hours after drinking one of these shakes. It was like I couldn't get enough food, I had to eat every two to three hours to stop the hunger. I am unsure whether it has to do with the combo of probiotic or the digestive enzyme that is added. Like I said though, after 5 days that feeling of starving all the time went away. It now fulfills me completely.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />This is the best meal shake I have come across thus far in my search for the perfect morning/ after workout shake. I have tried many from whole foods and other various health food stores. The fact that I have decided to actually buy another container of Amazing Meal must mean I really like it! I've been taking it for 2 weeks and, this wasn't my initial intention, but have lost 5 pounds. A nice little added bonus :)<br /><br />Highly reccomened if you are looking for a great protein/vitamin/healthy living shake. Oh and did I mention it is Alkaline based? Perfect!<br /><br />x x

review/summary: My Favorite--I LOVE this stuff
review/text: I have multiple food allergies, which makes a grab-and-go breakfast...well...not possible. I wanted a meal replacement shake because I tend not to eat during the day (way too complicated) and not eating actually helps me gain weight. I also have some other health issues--like Hashimoto's--directly related to my allergies. Food is an issue for me, and so is energy and feeling well.<br /><br />I'm not vegan, but I prefer vegan foods for their cleanliness. I can't have soy, but many vegan products are soy-free anyway. I also like whole, organic, Non-GMO foods, and while I prefer Raw, I don't mind non-raw foods, either.<br /><br />I tried several vegan, gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free shake mixes: Garden of Life, Vega, Inca Meal, RAW, etc. This is, by far, the best tasting, best "feeling" shake I've tried.<br /><br />I've tried all the flavors--Chocolate is my fave, then Pomegranate (sp?) Mango and Vanilla Chai, in that order. I mix mine is a shaker cup with a little mixing ball. I use Vanilla almond milk and a little agave syrup (I hate Stevia, it tastes like saccharine to me) and sometimes I throw a little extra hemp protein in, chia seeds, and flaxseed oil. I haven't bothered with a blender yet. One day, I'll put it into a blender with some fruit.<br /><br />Let's be real: this is a whole food shake with fruits, veggies, grasses, and hemp protein. This is not a mass-market, full-of-stuff-I-can't-pronounce homogenized drink. This is real food, synthesized down to a mixable level. Dunkin Donuts it's not. So?<br /><br />Truthfully, the pure, clean, feel-good energy I get from this, plus the cleansing, tonifying, and gut-health benefits are worth chugging down a slightly earthy drink every morning. Mixed with vanilla almond milk & a little agave, I actually savor the flavor--not too sweet (sweet in the morning makes me gag) chocolatey and, well, nutritious-y.<br /><br />Try a sample packet (you can get them at your local HFS, usually) and see which flavor suits you. I don't ever like this mixed in water--its just too thin. I DO use it on oatmeal, or stirred into yogurt. This is an awesome product. I just saved $12 over what I pay at WF, plus Amazon will deliver it to me every 15 days so I'll never run out...heaven!

review/summary: Amazing Meal ORIGINAL
review/text: The other flavors of Amazing Meal sound rather yummy but they contain "Natural Flavors"  this is the only version that does not.  I even went to their website to make sure.  The addition of natural flavors is the only reason why I chose their Original over the others.<br /><br />I find the flavor is somewhat bland & absolutley is grassy!  Lately I've been mixing it with organic coconut water.  The quality of the coconut water affects just how tasty my "meal" turns out.  Sometimes I will add a few drops of organic liquid Stevia.<br /><br />I'm not sure what it is about this product that keeps me coming back for more.  I use Amazon's Subscribe & Save for it!  I'm not nuts about it, yet here I am drinking another glass!<br /><br />It is a quick & convenient way to get something nourishing into my body.  I find it is very refreshing.  I have never used it in a smoothie but when I do, I think it will be out of this world!  I have also mixed this with organic almond milk, organic rice milk & organic coconut milk.  The rice milk tasted the best probably because it was the sweetest.  The coconut milk was so so.  For now, I plan on sticking with the coconut water because I think it is the healthiest option & it tastes good enough for me.<br /><br />Overall this is a great way to get your greens & more in one quick "meal" though snack would be more appropriate as I don't find it filling for long.  Usually I pour a small amount of my liquid of choice into a glass, add a scoop of this (scoop is included), use a fork to stir it really good.  Then I add the rest of my liquid of choice & do lots more stirring.  I leave the fork in the glass & stir as needed because the fiber bits tend to settle on the bottom rather quickly.  Thankfully the amount that settles is substantially less than other mixes I've had.  I had a Organic Hemp protein shake that I flat out thought was disgusting & nearly all of it would settle on the bottom of the glass so fast I couldn't help but waste it! I'm sticking to Amazing Meal from now on.  Lesson learned!<br /><br />If you want to do something healthy & want to avoid all sugars & artificial sweeteners this mix is the way to go!  All Organic & GMO free!  If you are one of those sugar junkies who gets those "fast food" smoothies thinking it's healthy when it's just a sugar bomb you will surely hate this stuff.  For the rest of you health nuts lets raise a glass in good health!

review/summary: Some of these reviews are ridiculous...  It's great - period
review/text: I'm not a vegan, vegetarian, nutrition freak, hippy, etc.... Yet, somehow, despite some of the reviews I've see, I find this stuff AMAZING.  It tastes great.  I mixed it with milk and loved it...  It doesn't dissolve completely so there is a bit of grainyness to it, but it's mild and didn't bother me in the slightest...<br /><br />Highly recommended...

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised (original flavor amazing meal)
review/text: I ordered this after comparing other natural brands such as Vega as a morning and or after workout shake. Although I am still curious about VEGA, I am very pleased that I chose this product instead. I chose this product because it seemed more simple and had no artificial sweetener (including stevia in that category) --stevia hasn't been well tested and there are other drawbacks to artificial sweetener such as deceiving the body's metabolism. I also read that Vega has a lot of Inulin which is a form of fiber that I have read is Not effective and is more of a filler to make things appear high in fiber.<br />Amazing meal in original flavor--When I got it in the mail I was surprised by the small size of the plastic can, but liked the packaging; It is visually pleasing and hopefully easily recycled. It is nice to see the ingredients are grown in America. The powder itself looks green and finely ground. I smelled it and could not tell if it would be palatable. I tasted a little in water and was pleased by the mild earthy taste. I then shook some in a blender bottle with ice and unsweetened soy milk. I was very relieved to find this expensive powder was not only palatable but tasted GOOD (to me). I am one of those people who are Used to the taste of natural foods. I could see myself adding a little honey to enrich the flavor. There is some granular-ness (not exactly gritty)  to the consistency, it is not all uniform, but this did not bother me. I was expecting a "grassy" taste as cued by other reviewers but I would call it more of a wheat, nutty flavor.  I am very happy with this purchase and will purchase this again if it manages to easily incorporate into my lifestyle. I would like it to be cheaper but I am ok with the quality and price. I bought it on the SUPER SAVER discount for a reduced price for regular shipments. Doing this is easy to cancel if you decide you don't like it.

review/summary: much better ingredients than listed in Amazon's blurb
review/text: This is a review of the pomegranate/mango infusion version.<br /><br />The product ingredients are much better than what appears in Amazon's product blurb.  The blurb makes it sound like it's sugar (cane juice) with pomegranate and mango added.<br /><br />In fact the ingredients are:<br />(1- proteins) Organic rice protein, organic hemp protein: 15,000mg<br />(2- greens) Organic wheat grass, organic kale, organic barley grass, organic alfalfa: 3,100mg<br />(3-antioxidants) Organic acai, organic carrot, organic blueberry, organic goji, Organic rose hips, organic maca, organic banana: 2,800mg<br />(4-other healthy stuff) Organic flax seed powder: 500mg, plus a small amount of probiotics<br />(5-other not-necessarily-healthy stuff) Organic cane juice, organic guar gum, natural flavors<br /><br />This is a good product to try if you want to get some of the benefits of wheat grass, kale, barley grass, etc. but tend to gag on the grass powders.  You won't gag on this.<br /><br />If you want to work up to the wheat grass, just add a little bit of that to a big scoop of this pomegranate/mango infusion and then work your way up.<br /><br />I add this to my dogs' food as a supplement.  They all love this pomegranate/mango taste.  This one lingers on their breath and makes them smell really good for a couple of hours after eating.

review/text: This is the best tasting superfoods product! I love the taste, that it has protein and has all the benefits of eating superfoods. I have tasted other brands but not one is as good as this. I'm not vegan, but I do eat gluten free, and I love that I can get a fair amount of protein (10 grams in 1 serving) from vegan/gluten free sources. I also did the 14 day challenge that Amazing Grass offers. It is less of a "challenge" and more of 14 days of nutritional knowledge. I found it to be interesting and helpful.

review/summary: Very satisfied
review/text: Ordered this item as I am trying to eat more healthy. Was very skeptical at first coz of all  the reviews on the taste but I thought that I would give it a shot. I ordered the Mango Pomegranate Infusion and was not disappointed. It is green alright and looked like swamp water, but it has a good flavor to it ( I mixed it with water to avoid extra calories ). The consistency is not too thick or grainy either. I prefer this more than the other green stuff I had in the past. I think that I will continue drinking it once a day from now on. Hopefully it will do what it claims or your health<br /><br />Update; so today 1/22/12 is my second day drinking this swamp water looking thing and I have to say that I like it even more. It has a flavor, but just a hint..a note of fruit flavor in it which is why I like. It is not heavily sweetened and not over powering. If you are expecting a strong fruit flavor to cover up the green, then look elsewhere. For me, I really like it.<br /><br />One month later,2/20/12, I can feel that I am in a very healthy stage of my life. Not to mention that it makes me not want to drink alcohol (which is good), but I believe that it was the reason why my root canal healed in less than two days after surgery. I had surgery on my front tooth (#25) treating my root canal @ 1pm Monday afternoon. And by Tuesday night, I was off pain Jed's and munching on popcorn! Not to mention that I had no swelling at all. What else can it be if not all the nutrients I am getting in addition if my food onus motion. I have moved on to the chocolate flavor and mix it with almond milk and one banana. It is it so good

The whole process take 1 minute and I'm not hungry again until lunch time!  It tastes great, sort of like gazpacho and It could not be more important to get enough leafy green veggies in anywhere we can! At less than $3.00 a shake, it is also a great price to pay for a quick nutritious no fuss breakfast that leaves you no clean up.

review/text: I tried all 3 flavors of amazing meal. I didn't like the vanilla chai (unless a big squeeze of chocolate syrup was added). I did like the chocolate and the mango one. I mix them with almond/coconut milk in a shaker cup, and take it in the car for an easy breakfast.  It's a little gritty (I've never tried anything other than w/ a simple shaker cup), but it's not chalky. As long as your expectations are in line with what this is (raw, vegan, etc and NOT a chocolate milk shake from the ice cream shop), it's a good meal replacement shake.

review/summary: Unbelievable Product
review/text: This is my first amazon review - I had to write about this product because I cannot believe how great it really is. Initially it was a little odd to take down - it mixes in green to water and has a "different" taste, but no aftertaste like many of these products. I took it for a few days and I cannot believe how I FEEL on this. Its not just energy, its just a good feeling that comes over me the entire day after downing this stuff in the morning. I was just sitting at work wondering why I was feeling so good and what I was doing that was different, and then it came to me. They have single serving packs they sell at whole foods. I bought them all. I dont know what it is about the combination of ingredients in this product, but its truly amazing. It doesnt just elevate your energy, it elevates your mood and your very being. Try it and see. You get used to the taste and ive had MUCH more offensive stuff. 5 stars all the way

review/summary: Good Breakfast Option
review/text: After reading the reviews I was slightly nervous about how this product would taste, but I found that when mixed with fruit and ice in the food processor it wasn't so bad. That being said it isn't delicious either, it's just okay and as tastes will differ you kind of have to try it and see. Also I didn't notice any increase in energy, but if I drink it for breakfast I often feel hungrier throughout the day as if it jump starts my metabolism. Overall, I like this shake as an option for breakfast it provides nutrients without weighing me down and tends to make me want to eat throughout the day, which is good for me because otherwise I wouldn't.

review/summary: New to Nutrition---Uhh Newtrition?
review/text: So basically I realized about 3 weeks ago that I hadn't eaten anything but sandwiches, burgers, or fast food, for as long as I could actually remember. I'm 22 and absolutely have not been eating my vegetables. I'm not overweight, because I don't really eat very much, maybe 2 meals a day, but I wanted to make sure I was healthy and nutritious. I started taking a Multi-V (GNC Men's Energy) but needed to it with food, and I normally do not eat breakfast, so I found Amazing Meal.<br /><br />This certainly, by no means, tastes like pomegranate or mango. Get that thought out of your head now and you'll be much better off. It tastes like hay/magic mushrooms with an undefinable whiff of fruitiness (not sweet).<br /><br />To get this down easiest, I mix a half scoop of the powder with a small amount of water, maybe 1 cup. I stir it up until it is very dark colored but not sludgy. I chug that down followed by some clean water. Not to bad. Then I take a quarter scoop of the powder and make a smoothie (frozen strawberries, frozen cranberries, frozen raspberries, half a banana, almond milk, Greek yogurt, and 2 teaspoons of coconut oil (I'm working slowly up to 2 tablespoons)).<br /><br />That's my breakfast. I also take 1 Alpha Brain each day and 2 ShroomTech Immune every other day. It is completely night and day from when I ate unhealthy and didn't take any nutrients. Just three weeks ago. Pretty nuts.

( which never happens) anyway I opened it and had a serving and was shocked that it tasted pretty good. Now for those who have tried vegan drinks you know that they are not always the best tasting thing but this is definitely one of the better drinks I have had. I will be reordering this and I will now try the other flavors and hope they are as good as this one.

I ran out of my amazing grass for a week or so and did not know at to do with myself, I love the stuff. I use it as a meal replacement and I do believe it makes me feel great! I have to eat on the go alot and this fills me up and keeps my energy levels up so i dont feel hypo-glycemic. Lost a few pounds too! cant argue with that! I mix it with half water(mixes better) and vanilla or chocolate almond milk and its a great healthy alternative to a fast food meal, and I'm begining to think food is over-rated anyway.

review/summary: Easy on the stomach
review/text: Atleast for me it is. I have tried many meal replacements over the years and so far could not find any that were easy to digest. Eating food is even difficult for me with how my health is and after trying chocolate infusuion a year ago I quickly fell in love.<br />I can honestly say that this does NOT taste like grass. It has a very bold and delicious chocolate flavor. Mix it with some lightly sweetened vanilla almond milk and its more than flavorful! I admit if you just shake up or mix it in a cup it will be a little lumpy or grainy but I love the texture. My husband always puts it in a blender which makes the consistency like a thin milkshake, especially if you add blueberries which I highly recommend.I Drink it every morning and it holds me over for 3-4 hours depending if I eat fruit or something along with it. Dont care much for the other flavors but still need to try the chai vanilla.

review/text: I used this in a smoothie and my son and I loved it. It is not just a meal replacement or energy/vitamin drink it is made from whole super foods, which means it is extremely good for you. I wouldn't compare it to something from GNC that isn't superfood based. Buying whole food vitamins is very costly, and this is a good cost for what is delivered, without having to take mounds of large pills to get the same result. We are not completely vegetarian, but we do not eat red meat, and we do not eat fast and junk food. We only eat real food, but even then it is easy to favor certain items over others. I wanted something to balance my diet and hopefully improve my over-all nutrition. Will be buying more, and continuing to improve the health of my family with items like this. Next stop... super mushrooms!

review/text: Pros - Good clean energy that does not make me instantly sleepy or wear out after an hour.<br /><br />Cons - The biggest hurdle with this stuff is getting it blended into anything.  It is very stubborn and likes to form chunks.  The taste is weird and texture is like drinking wet sand.<br /><br />The energy boost was enough to drive me into several weeks of experimentation.  My best advice is to put this into a smoothie or milkshake of some sort.  It will be a gritty smoothie but still better than attempting to drink it in water or milk.  I have also baked it into cookies which worked out really well.  Strangely enough it levels off the initial sugar rush you'd get from the cookies and you don't experience a crash afterwards.<br /><br />It is interesting stuff to experiment with for sure.  I'll definitely keep using it for quick meals.

review/summary: Tasty Way to Get Your Veggies and Vegan Protein
review/text: I usually make my own green smoothies at home.  But for work and travel, need a more easy alternative.  I've tried a LOT of commercial "green" powder and most tasty seriously nasty and a few are tolerable but nothing to write home about.  This is by far my most favorable flavor and product.  I get all my serving of greens and also a great source of protein (better than yogurt and equal to some protein bars).  This is what I have for breakfast every morning.  I leave the can in the office and just mix it with water.  When I travel, I take the individual travel packs with me.  I can actually say this product is tasty, but like all protein powder, it does has that gritty protein powder texture.  But if you're used to protein powders, this should be familiar.  Other than the grittiness, it tastes like a light chocolate shake (if you use soy or almond milk, texture will be thicker). I sometimes do juice but usually just water. I've tried the other flavors and they don't taste as good, at least for me.

I have had many other protein drinks but have not found any to be as good as this. If I could give this ten stars, I would.<br /><br />It is September 16, 2012 and I am amending this review. I am buying this Amazing Grass by the truckload, still love it and I am also adding something called Protein<br />Greens by Orac-Energy. I also add a table spoon of Whole Husk Psyllium purchased here on Amazon which works very well and also thickens the drink. The strong chocolate flavor hides the taste from those two products I add. It all makes for a fantastic breakfast.

review/summary: Best Meal Drink Powder Mix I Have Tried
review/text: I have tried several meal replacement products, and make note that Amazing Grass has this Amazing Meal and also a SuperFood drink powder that looks similar and the same flavors, so I am not sure what the difference actually is, but the word "Meal" in the title meant to me that it was more likely what I was looking for than just a supplement powder. Anyway, the whole family got on a health kick after Mom got cancer and we tried to find the healthiest yet easiest to stick with supplements. After learning of the incredible benefits of wheat grass and the other ingredients in this mix (and yes I know you don't get the full benefit of the wheat grass unless it is freshly cut, juiced and immediately ingested), I decided to give this a try.  Although it doesn't keep me from being hungry for more than a few hours, that is with any typical meal that is intended for small portions anyway, it is very satisfying both with substance and taste. My suggested blending one full scoop of the powder with either 10 ounces of Almond, rice, flax or soy milk (or combination), and then one packet of stevia (I personally use Sweet Leaf) and blend with 1/2 cup or so of ice. Any more ice and the consistency is not liquid enough to drink without letting melt or watering down with more milk. I have found the small bit of stevia removes a lot of the in your face grass taste some others have mentioned, and I truly enjoy drinking this rather than having to slam down something I don't enjoy just to get the benefits.

review/text: Many great reviews already here, not much more to add.  Out of all other flavors of this brand, this is my favorite, I appreciate the extra fruity zing of the pomegranate and sometimes add some raw cocoa powder to it.<br />Makes a great snack just mixed with fruit or yogurt, or excellent base for a smoothie (with fruit, yogurt, rice milk or fruit juice, maybe some lecithin, flax seed oil, almond butter, whatever soothes your taste buds).<br />It's packed with nutrition and a wonderful supplement to any diet.

review/summary: Great meal replacement
review/text: I got the monthly subscription of this product for my Father (who prefers drinking his breakfast rather than eating it). This really is an "Amazing Meal", it has so many good things in it. My father says the flavor isn't too bad. You have to drink it fast though, because if you let it sit the smoothie like texture will turn like pudding. The product says 15 servings, but my Father uses half of the "Suggested Serving Size", and it lasts about 30 servings. Overall, my Father loves this product, and has asked me to keep on buying it for him.

review/text: My doctor recently suggested that I try going Gluten Free to possibly alleviate some of the allergy and sinus issues I have been experiencing the past six months or so. So I've been looking for easier ways to get all the nutrition I need without having to spend a ton of time and money. I found this product and after checking out the ingredients, I decided to give it a try. I know some of the reviews complain about the taste or consistency of the product, but I ordered this knowing that it probably wasn't going to taste like a McDonald's milkshake. I've only been using it for a couple of days now and only with water, but so far I'm enjoying it. Yes, it's a little grainy but I suspect if I mix it with coconut milk or greek yogurt, it wouldn't be as evident. The taste is pretty much what I expected, earthy and wholesome. I've been living without sugar or sweeteners for years so I find it pleasant. I will definitely be reordering this or perhaps one of the other flavors/varieties offered by Amazing Grass.

review/summary: Surprised by how much I enjoyed it!
review/text: I put a serving in the blender with half non homogenized grass-fed organic whole milk and half the same milk but skim, and maybe it's because I love healthy tasting food and greens and have not had chocolate in a long time, but I personally LOVED it. It made me feel good about eating chocolate flavored food. I got a small packet of it to try first. You might want to do the same if you have a whole foods, or mrs greens around you. I will be purchasing this big tub within the week! It's important to me that this is gluten free too because I'm discovering just how sensitive to it I am by avoiding it for the time being and I can share it with my mother and my gluten sensitive friends!

review/text: Yes, this powder is essentially grass and all that good stuff you can't bear to stomach on it's own. But if you know that going into trying it, it's not so bad. I like to blend mine with almond milk and berries. Almond milk alone doesn't quite do it for me, but the berries add another dimension. If you're one this people who tend to gag easily, this may not be for you. For everyone else who is looking for a health supplement, it's a must try .

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: I bought a single serving pouch to try (on sale) and liked it enough to buy a tub.  For whatever reason the single serving (pouch) seemed tastier (and gave me some 'pep') while the stuff in the tub didn't seem quite as 'chocolaty' (and I didn't notice much if any 'pep').  Kinda made me wonder if the single servings aren't made a little different but it's possible for different batches to vary in taste and effect.<br /><br />Regardless, I like it a lot. From both a nutritional and taste perspective I don't think Amazing Meal can be beat.  I don't eat nearly as much fruits and vegetables as I'd like so I really appreciate the punch of nutrients Amazing Meal packs.<br /><br />I think Amazing Grass has done an awesome job of taking a huge amount of healthy ingredients and turning them into something that tastes, if not good, at least not bad (try putting a scoop of dried greens in your breakfast drink and see how that tastes - this is WAY better!).  I don't find the taste of Amazing Meal at all bad as some people have said.  Everybody's different - if your not sure you want to commit to a whole tub go to PCC and pick up a single serving.<br /><br />The stuff in the tub wasn't super chocolaty but you can get more chocolate flavor by using chocolate milk (or chocolate almond milk) or varying quantities of whatever milks you like to adjust the sweetness/chocolate to suit your taste (I use 3/4 regular milk to 1/4 chocolate almond milk).  You could always toss in some of your own cocoa powder for that matter.<br /><br />I came up with a breakfast shake that I like a lot that holds me easily for several hours by using a combination of protein powders (Amazing Meal & Whey), 1/4 c raw oats, 1 tbl wheat germ, 1 tbl omega oil (I'm using walnut oil right now), 1/2 c blueberries and sometimes a heaping spoonful of greek yogurt (sometimes I add almond butter which is REALLY good also!).<br /><br />The point I'm trying to make is that you can play around with the ingredients to come up with whatever suits YOUR taste and 'staying power'.  I couldn't make it through to lunch on the Amazing Meal alone but along with the other ingredients I add it plays a huge part in satisfying my hunger for several hours (Whey alone doesn't work for me).<br /><br />Everybody's tastes and needs are different - play around with different combinations of ingredients that you like until you find what works well for YOU.<br /><br />I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because of the difference in taste/effect between the single serve and the tub.  I'm on my second tub of Amazing Meal but trying the 'Vanilla Chai' this time just to change things up a bit.

review/summary: Price is meh but flavour is decent
review/text: I bought the chocolate infusion. I mixed it with organic whole milk, not using the full 10 ounces, and thought it was pretty drink-able. Not amazingly chocolate-y, but enough that I could chug it without feeling too "healthy". Definitely not something I'd savor though.<br /><br />It did mix up pretty smooth, with little of the clumps that just won't die and had a good texture.<br /><br />All the reviews I read said that they felt energized and full for a long time after they drank it. I drank it at about 2pm and didn't feel particularly full afterwards and now at near 4pm I'm feeling positively hungry. Meal replacement? Perhaps not.<br /><br />Also, I'm still feeling really sleepy so that whole energizing thing? Nah.<br /><br />Noting, a lot of the reviews I read were done around 2009 and were done with free samples. I'm wondering how much of their glowing reviews was based off of psychosomatic happy feelings on getting a relatively good tasting drink to experiment with, how much of it was due to them being people who were already pretty healthy to begin with ( also known as the raw/vegan/scary type who CAN easily subsist off of meal replacement shakes) and how much of it was that Amazing Grass had a better product back then and has since declined in quality.<br /><br />Not to be cynical, but I've noticed that the first year or so of a company putting out a product, they tend to have amazing stuff, and then it usually goes downhill after that. And then there are the others that get bought out and just suck after that. Naked Juice, Burt's Bees, I'm looking straight at you.<br /><br />Meh. I guess I'll finish this container since I already paid for it, but I doubt I'll be back for more.

review/text: I've been drinking Amazing Grass' Chocolate version for months and just ADORE it.  I decided to try the Mango Amazing Meal and was very turned off by the texture and flavor.  I'm sure the texture issue has to do with the dried mango.  I tried it with both almond milk and coconut milk, adding 1/2 frozen banana.  It turned out way too sweet as I didn't realize it already has sweetener in it.  Without the banana, it wasn't any better.  I still have quite a bit left...I will try it with OJ as someone else commented on doing.  Hope that improves the taste!

review/text: We decided to try this soup just as a change of pace (we normally get the canned Campbell's soups). What a pleasant surprise. We also had the lentil and neapolitan bean varieties, but the white bean is our favorite so far. For approximately the same price as the Campbell's big cans you get a MUCH tastier soup and more of it. To me, this tastes as good as restaurant soup. It's so simple to make: just add water. We just discovered this soup several days ago and will probably be eating lots of it from now on. The only thing keeping me from giving this soup five stars is (like most soups) the sodium is a little on the high side. But all things considered, this is wonderful soup you can make easily at home and I highly recommend it.

review/text: I love soup, and this is the best soup I've ever had from a package!  It's my ultimate quick meal...I buy a rotisserie chicken, shred it and add to the soup.  I also add more chicken stock and some more cooked (small) pasta and ta-da...instant delicious meal!  It also goes twice as far with those few added ingredients.

review/summary: Great tasting
review/text: This soup taste great.  Even better if you add the olive oil and grated parm cheese.  Only takes about 15 mins to make.<br /><br />The package arrived quick.  Ordered on Sunday night, had Tuesday morning (used prime, 2 shipping) - a day early.<br /><br />I will probably order a few more boxes very soon.

review/summary: Best soup mix I've found.
review/text: This is, without a doubt, the best dry soup mix I have found. Great for a quick meal when you don't feel like cooking from scratch. My trick is to let it simmer for 15 minutes, then add a can of white beans, undrained, and simmer for another 10 minutes. Top with a good olive oil, fresh Romano and freshly cracked black pepper. Make a mixed salad while it is cooking, and there you are. A nice, healthy dinner in about 30 minutes. Everyone I have made this for loves it. Definitely worth a try.

review/summary: Better living through chemistry
review/text: The local grocery store is going out of business so I picked this up at 25% off. I was happy to find something in the soup aisle that wasn't Campbells or Progresso. Unfortunately the family was less inspired by the end result.<br /><br />Alessi Zuppa Toscana cooks up easily. Once you get past the romanticized marketing verbiage, the instructions wrap by suggesting that you add some olive oil to the final product, followed by topping it with grated cheese. I like these touches but ultimately the servings went largely uneaten. I told one kid no dessert until he'd finished the cup of soup. My wife intervened, saying the soup had an aftertaste and she wasn't keen on its consistency either. These things didn't bother me. I'm not sure what she meant but given that it's a bean soup it's going for "hearty". It wasn't one of those "brimming with subtle flavors" products, but I wasn't expecting that anyway.<br /><br />I should have glanced at the ingredients and nutritional information before loading up the shopping cart with interesting products from the soup aisle. Amazon does a good job of listing the ingredients, so it's up to you if you're okay with MSG and other entries that can serve as euphemisms for "more MSG". As with most processed soups, this is high in sodium - 660mg to a one cup serving. If laboratory concoctions like hydrolized or autolyzed anything are acceptable, this could work well for you as a soup base. As is, the final product results in four one cup servings.

review/text: A.Z.T.T.T.W.B.S. is, or would be, an excellent base for building a nice pot of healthy soup but for the MSG and unneccessarily high sodium content.  A reduced salt version would merit more stars.

review/summary: nice product
review/text: I was using Bob's Red Mill ground flax seed before now and personally do not see any difference since I started using Hodgson Mill, though I just saw a couple of reviews saying Bob's was coarser and tasted better. I have not detected any difference.<br /><br />I like that it comes as a sealed bag in a in a box as it is easier to store (I keep it in my freezer after opening to maintain freshness and avoid it going rancid etc. though the fridge is probably just as good).<br /><br />I add flax seed to my cereal - usually oatmeal, but more recently have been adding a couple of tablespoons to the junky cereals my kids use. I have also added it to applesauce and have added it to bread and pizza dough too.  When I was making waffles once I added some blueberries and some flax seed meal and they were great.

review/summary: Healthy and good way to get omega 3's
review/text: This is a good  way to get my Omega 3 since I dont like fishy fish.  It is also a way to get good fiber.  In order to get the omega benefit of flax it has to be the ground flax and I used to  grind it myself but this is much more convenient. this particular brand of flax seed is my favorite among the ones I have found in the store. I  like it better than Bob's red mill atho get  that if I have to.<br /><br />I buy this with the automatic ordering every 6 months and it saves me money and no shipping if done this way along with the 10% off.  I put several  heaping teaspoons in my cranberry juice in the morning.  some people put it in baked goods or on cereal.  I have also added to rice mixtures, casseroles, hot chocolate etc - whatever strikes my fancy.

It's so convenient to have items shipped automatically plus you receive an additional discount on the price along with free shipping.  I mix flax seed with milk, yogart, cereal, etc.  You can also bake with it.  A good way to get Omega 3!

review/text: We love Hodgson Mills products!  Their Gingerbread is great and they have whole wheat bread machine mixes which I have trouble finding here in the frozen north!  It's nice to get these products via Amazon.  The price is better per case from Hodgson Mills directly but with 2 day free shipping I get with Amazon it evens out and ordering is so easy with Amazon. Nice addition!  K

review/summary: Flax Seed for Fiber
review/text: I use this wonderful product daily by mixing 3 or 4 tablespoons with orange juice or Sunny D for fiber.  After years of purchasing flax seed at the health food stores at a much higher price, I decided to try this product.  This has become my product of choice in an ongoing battle with constipation.  In addition, my cholesterol numbers have been great and I attribute that to the omega 3 in the flax seed I take daily.  I split each shipment with a girlfriend and she has noticed an improvement in her cholesterol numbers also. No more need for laxatives or stool softeners, which are more expensive.  Must be drank immediately after mixing, or it will thicken.  Great taste, easy going down.  One day, I'll try baking something with this product.

review/summary: Hodgson Mill Flax Seed
review/text: We have been purchased Hodgson Flax Seed for several years now from Amazon, and find they always have the best price, and free shipping with the right order quantity.  The Flax Seed is sealed inside the box, so it is always fresh when we open it.  We both use it on our cereal in the morning, and usually buy two cases when we purchase it (two boxes of 12). Very happy with the product and we have purchased other Hodgson products with equal success.

review/summary: You really should buy it whole and grind it yourself.
review/text: To get the most benefits out of your extremely shelf-unstable flax seeds, you really should buy them whole and grind them yourself (I have a coffee mill for only this purpose). However, that is not always convenient, so buying already milled seeds is an option. For milled seeds, this isn't the tastiest or the freshest I've had--Bob's Red Mill pre-milled flax seeds taste much fresher, and the seeds aren't milled to a near powder. You can still see some texture and shape. These seeds are okay, but don't really add any flavor or depth. Go with Bob's or mill your own.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: It's flax meal.  Healthy.  Easy to add to an endless variety of foods.  Non-offensive taste.  I haven't had any problems with Hodgson Mill's milled flax seed, and, with Subscribe and Save, it's probably the cheapest of any product I've seen--but only by a fraction of a penny or so since I started shopping at Costco.  And the one at Costco is organic.  And, while the package at Costco is a bulk item, it's not as big as eight 12-oz boxes.  I really hate to say it since it's a great product with no discernable defects and *ALMOST* the best value I can find anywhere, but the organic flax at Costco wins in my opinion.  If you don't have a Costco membership, or your location doesn't sell the organic flax, this is still definitely a great value (and probably the first runner up).

review/text: I use Hodgson products, but most of all the Flax Seed is a must for making my homemade bread, using one tablespoon when making one loaf of bread. The bread is made from half whole wheat and half white flour plus the flax seeds. The bread turns out very moist and tasty. I placed a photo of banana bread made from rye flour, flax seed, sugar, and half white flour plus three banana, spices, and margarine.<br /><br />SPR<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDMM08">Hodgson Mill Organic Whole Wheat Spaghetti with Milled Flax Seed, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001G6V6K">Hodgson Mill, Cereal Hot Oat Bran, 16 OZ</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001G6V7O">Hodgson Mills Unprocessed Wheat Bran -- 14 oz</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IN28BY">Hodgson Mill Gluten Free Cookie Mix, 12-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>
