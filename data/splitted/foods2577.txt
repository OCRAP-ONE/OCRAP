review/summary: Worth the Cost
review/text: I have used the Brooks Chili Beans to make my Chili for over 20 years.  I am not a great cook, but people have always raved about my chili.  When we recently moved to the east coast, I completely panicked when I realized the stores here do not carry my Brooks Beans.  I made my chili with different beans and it was just not the same.  I was so excited to find them through Amazon.  The shipping cost is about the same as the cost of the beans, but the extra cost is well worth it!  You can not beat the taste of the<br />special sauce!

review/summary: Best cup of coffee in a long time
review/text: I like Keurigs and Senseo coffee pots.  Unfortunately, I do not always like the available k-cups and pods.  This particular pod, however, is really really good.  And I think price-wise it came in pretty reaseonable.  I hope they continue to make it and that the name doesn't indicate only a seasonal availability.  Overall, I think I prefer the pods to the k-cups which are generally stronger tasting with possibly more caffeine.  But I fear that some of the more generously packed pods are hard on the Senseo which must properly close down on the pod to prevent overspills.  Nevertheless, this pod will remain on my buying list as long as it is available and I will just be careful with the Senseo.  Incidentally, I do use a Solofill and can use these pods in my Keurig/MrCoffee pot (smaller imprint on limited countertop).  I gave my larger Keurig to son/grandson and bought the MrCoffee/Keurig pot and love that too.  You all have gotten three reviews in one, all positive, MrCoffee/Keurig pot, Solofill for pods used in Keurigs, and best tasting coffee in a long time.

review/summary: Wonderful coffee
review/text: My wife enjoy this wonderful full bodied coffee.  It maintains a great balance and smells so good during the brewing process.  My wife is not a fan of all the grinding, but to me it is worth it (plus the subscribe and save discount).  I am a "straight black coffee" drinker that wants to enjoy the coffee for what it is.  Although, i may need to invest in a turkish coffee pot and try this blend for its namesake........

review/summary: Stopped the Spit-Up!!!  I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS PRODUCT!
review/text: My son began spitting up A LOT around one and a half months.  So I tried other formulas thinking maybe the regular formula didn't sit well with his stomach - none of them worked!  Then I recieved a coupon in the mail for the Enfamil AR - and I went right out and got some.  It worked great!  He didn't really spit up any at first - he does spit up a little more now but I think that is due to him being on his belly alot (he is 5 months now and working on crawling).  But it isn't nearly as bad as it was!  I am greatful for that.  The only problem I have with this formula is that I have a hard time mixing the powder so I use the ready-to-use can.  It is perfectly fine for at home.  I just pour the 32oz. of formula in a plastic bottle/container and keep it in the fridge.  When he is hungry I pour some into a bottle and warm it up.  But when I am going somewhere it is a hassle to take the cold bottles and stuff to warm the formula up.  So I am getting some of the 3oz. nursette bottles that I found at the Enfamil website.  They are stored at room temp so I can just use 2 of the 3oz. and pour them in his bottle and won't have to worry about heating up whenever we are out somewhere.  I hope this helps someone!

review/summary: This is wonderful!!  Stopped the spit up
review/text: My daughter is 7 weeks old and has reflux and this absolutely worked to stop her spit up.  She was spitting up constantly and everyone said "babies spit!"  Thank god my peditirician recommended this formula to me as she had used it for her 4 month old son.  Its great and my daughter is happier and eating way more as well.  I have heard bad things about the powder so I haven't tried it.  I am lucky my daughter likes it cold, so i don't have to worry about heating on the go.  Although I did see several warmers in babies r us for travel.  I just ordered the fridge-to-go cooler that stays cold for 12 hours to travel with.  I haven't received it yet but I am very hopeful this solves my travel with the ready to feed problems.

You can't go wrong with this one.

You are getting four 1.2 Oz cans that each contain 8 packets that make 8 quarts.<br /><br />The packets of the store-bought can make 2 quarts each.  The Amazon-bought can packets make only 1 quart each.  It may take a little math to ensure you are getting a decent value.

review/summary: Good Value, Good Product
review/text: If I'm able, I always like to order items I use in bulk through amazon - good prices, free shipping, and home delivery. Triple win.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of crystal light, with all the caffeine I drink I know I should be drinking more water, but can't get myself to crave the bland taste. Enter Crystal light. There are a ton of good flavors to choose from, but my criteria was as follows:<br /><br />1. A flavor not so extreme that I would get sick of it after a week. A mix of tart and sweet, neither one too strong.<br />2. I could purchase in bulk and not have to think about restocking for a while<br />3. Great price<br /><br />This product fit the bill perfectly. The lemonade is a burst of tart, but the raspberry brings it back down to a more neutral flavor. So whether you want lemonade or juice, the raspberry lemonade can do the trick.<br /><br />As for the packaging, the shipment came with 4 canisters that hold 8 extra-large packets. The packets are exactly double the size of the standard crystal light packets - so you're essentially getting 16 packets per canister. The directions advise 1 quart water per packet and since I tend to use CL in cups, water bottles, and glasses, I am able to use about half the packet each time I use (1 regular packet).<br /><br />Overall, this is a great buy and I will be purchasing again through Amazon.<br /><br />NOTE: It looks like Amazon increased the price of this product significantly. I see it now at $19.99. I purchased for $6.62. Obviously Amazon prices change constantly, so I would keep a look out for a deal before purchasing. I would personally just buy the cheapest one since they all essentially do the same thing anyway, and I have yet to come across an awful crystal light.

review/text: Crystal Light replaces soda in my dieting efforts, which is a big help.  Just like another reviewer said, each canister has eight packets, each of which only makes one quart instead of the two quarts you expect when purchasing from major grocers.  I didn't notice this until after it arrived.  I'm okay with it since I have a jumbo Bubba mug that holds approximately a quart, but the buyer should be aware of what they're getting, especially if you're trying to calculate your savings versus store pricing.

review/summary: Best quality, from a company with conscience
review/text: I cannot drink coffee, and I use herbal teas for beverages, wellness elixirs, and home remedies for illness.  Chamomile is one of the best, most gentle, most versatile herbs--it helps with sleeplessness, digestive upset, nerves, grumpiness, cold/flu symptoms, etc.  I drink it every day along with other teas because I love it so much.  Traditional Medicinals is a great company.  You know the herbs you're getting from them are certified organic, the company uses high post-consumer recycled content in their packaging, they use pharmacoepial strength herbs, and their plant runs on wind power.  It's a win-win-win...good for you, good for the planet, good for the company, when you buy their teas.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: suppose it works...
review/text: I drink this w/another tea for easing digestion and the combo is working. Sometimes I have the Chamomile by itself, so can say the taste is very mild, really close to bland, but it is soothing...well, I haven't blown a cork while drinking anyway.<br />The tea bag floats, which may not bother other people; but, I do prefer my tea bags to sink into the water...so I know I'm getting maximum brew.

review/text: Chamomile and organic, what more is there to say.  This Camomile does the job without having other additives in the tea bag, only the flower.  It calms wonderfully, relaxes in a few minutes.  Also can be used as an eye flush if you have allergies or other eye irritants.  Tradition Medicinals is a good brand and I recommend it to anyone looking for a great tea.  Add some honey or lemon to make it even better.

review/summary: Our Favorite Celestial Seasonings Tea
review/text: Since our family has discovered Red Safari Spice it became an instant favourite!<br />It's a great "comfort drink". With it's gentle mixture of spices it is relaxing and caffeine free. There is a soft flavour which blends wonderfully with the spices and lingers on the tongue. We were surprised to discover that this was created with a touch of banana - softening the spices without giving it a fruity flavour.  Our family enjoys this tea with a bit of sugar and milk. It is a drink that can be enjoyed by all ages. The obvious aroma in the kitchen of the spices of the steeping tea is an added bonus. The health benefits of Rooibos Tea has been a blessing to my husband especially. For years he has suffered from stomach cramps, etc., if he eats dinner too late - which happened frequently due to the length of his commute home. One of the several benefits of Rooibos Tea is it's ability to soothe stomach cramps. My husband has not experienced this once since we have been drinking this tea. I try to welcome him home with a cup of Red Safari Spice or serve it to him with supper. Try it, and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as we do!

review/text: When I first saw the list of flavors in Dr Pepper Jazz, I said, "That's way too many flavors. Dr Pepper already has 23..." Which is about the same reaction I had when I tried this tea. I don't want to bag on Celestial Seasonings (that's a little tea pun), because they make a quality product, but I only bought Red Safari Spice because my local store was out of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LQU">Celestial Seasonings Madagascar Vanilla Red</a>. I'm not a fan. It reminds me of mulling spices, and I'm not a fan of mulled cider. So it's not a "bad" tea; just not my cup of it.

review/summary: A little too busy!
review/text: I love Celestial Seasonings rooibos based teas--in particular their Madagascar Vanilla Red, and Moroccan Pomegranate.  Red Safari Spice tries to do too many things and creates a busy blend that did not grab me. The combination of fruit and spice was just not tasty--and I am not a fan of banana flavoring in tea.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box: "In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous."  Aristotle.

review/text: Bought these to make gluten free eggrolls for my granddaughter and they worked great.  Tried to fry them but the rice wrapper gets bubbles in it and they absorb a lot of oil.  Since everything inside the eggroll is already cooked it is better to just roll the eggroll in a shallow dish of water(to make the wrapper a little softer)just before eating.  I personally think they taste better when they are not fried.  Dip them in some sweet and sour sauce and enjoy. yum! yum!

review/text: I tried making eggrolls with these, and they just totally don't work if you're going to fry them. The rice paper sticks to the papertowels, and to the other eggrolls, and they fall apart when you try to remove them. When they're first wet and wrapped, they're really flimsy as well. They easily fall apart. Not good for real eggrolls. I'm dumping these things, as I have no use for them.

review/summary: Americans beware, curious labeling
review/text: the product is listed as a 150g 6-pack.<br />Traditionally, when US companies do a bundle-pack they list the size of the individuals...so a 6 pack of canned soda would be a 12oz 6-pack, we would never see that listed as a 72oz 6-pack<br /><br />I foolishly assumed I was getting a real bargain, 6 150g bags, for about $8!<br />Oh so wrong. It's a 6-pack of 25g bags, 150g TOTAL<br /><br />So you're getting about the equivalent of one bag of chips for your money. Still, not a terrible deal for something a little exotic.<br /><br />The chips themselves were good, though! I only took stars off for the somewhat deceptive descriotion and the fact it took a couple of weeks for them to arrive.

review/text: My 9 year old cat can be a bit of a picky eater. I wanted to try some different treats that didn't have the loaded by-product most anything made for pets seems to have. The thing I like most about these is they're not just treats, they can be used to supplement or even replace your cat food. A little pricey to replace considering my cat gets 1/2 cup of food a day, but not a bad thing to have around when the stores run out of your grain-free food.

review/summary: Brilliant bulk buy
review/text: I fell in love with Stash chocolate mint tea two years ago.  I am thrilled to be able to buy it now in an economical and environmentally friendly way.  This is used for my private use and I've felt uncomfortable with all the many boxes I've gone through in order to have my six bag a day tea fix.  If you are a tea junkie and care about our landfill situation then go for broke and purchase this way and save yourself a couple of hundred bucks.

review/summary: A ginormous box of 1,000 tea bags
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile. I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you really, truly like chamomile tea, or own a restaurant, this ginormous box of 1,000 single-serving tea bags is a good choice.

review/summary: Why pay for organic soup that has BPA in it?
review/text: My daughter loved this soup, but I was disappointed to discover that Earth's Best uses a resin liner on their canned foods that contains BPA - a toxic chemical for children.  While the company says the levels are low and within acceptale government standards, BPA is known to leech even more into acidic products like diced tomatoes, or tomato soup.  So, until Earth's Best moves to glass jars, we'll have to refrain from eating this yummy soup.

review/text: The overall flavor in this soup is not bad, however it's extremely difficult to chew.<br />When my daughter tried to chew it, she seemed to be having problems so then she kept<br />trying to swallow it, and continued to choke each time. I had a few bites myself, and<br />I found that even I had difficulty chewing the beans--they were SO HARD! For a toddler<br />to eat this was next to impossible. I definitely wont ever buy this again and wouldn't<br />recommend it for a child or an adult.

I like the soup it is  shame the cans are not a good quality. I wonder how safe the soup is to eat if the can is so easily dented and smashed. I reported this same concern to the company. I will never buy soup via mail again. I found that the cans do the same thing if bought from the local store so I will not be purchasing this product in the future.

Ahmad tea cardamon flavor is exactly the same as the tea they served in Iraq and since this is the only place I can get it I think it's a great deal as well as being some of the best Chai tea I have ever had. I would recomend it to anyone that is looking for a great Chai tea.

review/summary: Top of the samples line
review/text: This coffee came with the "starter pack" for our Keurig coffeemaker and was near the last of the pack to be sampled.  It rated 5/5 and #2 of 25 by Dad and #3 by Mom.<br /><br />Brewed/reviewed using the largest (automobile tumbler) water size.  As stated, a "bold" taste with a heady toasted coffee aroma.  This is a medium-body coffee, despite the implication on the packaging that it is a dark coffee (it is not a dark or french roast).  Finishes clean with little or no aftertaste and no metallic taste whatsoever.  (People's coffee all had metallic finish for us.)  This is our winner for "anytime" coffee.<br /><br />The big winner was Van Houtte single-source coffees.  Absolutely perfect, but alas, not carried by Amazon, and twice the price of blended beans.<br /><br />Timothy's Morning blend was our winner for a lightly toasted coffee.  Gentle, smooth, and goes well with afternoon snacks or light lunch.<br /><br />All of the teas were perfect, but at the price we'll stick with teabags.

OK, not the same as a fresh cup from my local Caribou Coffee, but it's bold and dark, full of flavor, and not burnt tasting at all.  I have found most of the K-cups I tried to produce dishwater, just not enough coffee in them to make a full-flavor cup.  I have been drinking Timothy's Midnight Magic Extra Bold, also very nice--just ran out, and picked up the Newman's at Costco (no time for shipping).  It's a very worthy competitor, very very nice.

However, though the Newman's own pods are not indicated as being flavored, they alas are.  I've once in a while gotten same aroma and taste at truck stops and restaurants, but don't know what the flavoring is.  Hate the aroma, hate the flavor; what I want is UNADULTERATED PURE COFFEE.

review/text: I have been accused of going over-board on some things and my K-Cup obsession has been no different. I have tried almost every bold K-Cup on the market (really, my kitchen is full of those little boxes). Many of them are very good, and some (like Timothy's Rainforest Espresso) are excellent. Still, for day to day drinking I always go back to this blend. I find it to be smooth and satisfying. I use the second to smallest setting on my Keurig B70 (7 1/4 oz.) and I usually enjoy three to four cups in the morning (I never reuse a K-Cup, but if it works for some people, fine). If I want more or a cup later in the day I switch to the decaf version, also very good.<br /><br />I miss my Newman's Own so much when I travel that I have started packing a Keurig B30 with me so I can enjoy this coffee on the road. I now also drink Coffee People's Organic blend, as a matter of fact I have grown to prefer it but that does not take away from how good of a coffee this is.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]

review/text: I bought the 80 count Newmans Own because it is the best coffee I have tried in the k cup. Period.<br />Plus, it is supposed to be organic, and I tust this brand because it is the Newman name and hope his daughter is running a tight ship on her parents behalf.<br />However, I was in a hurry when I ordered and did not cross check price or shipping cost (DUH! as my kids would say).<br />I paid twelve dollars more for this item than I would have at Costco and then the seller (Potential Dynamix LLC)gouged me with a $[...] shipping charge. Never again. We cannot assume because we are buying something on AMAZON that we are getting great prices.<br />Heck, I knew that.<br />Guess I just need to re learn stuff now.
