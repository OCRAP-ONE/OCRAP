review/summary: Tastes exactly like the real thing
review/text: I've tried all the other coconut waters out there and I have a problem with two things. First....the coconut water itself always tastes musky and sour. Second, the packaging is completely unrecyclable. The whole point of drinking fresh natural coconut water is because it's also sustainable. But to package the water in these useless vacuum packs just adds more waste to the landfills<br />Amy and Brian's products, first and foremost taste EXACTLY like a fresh young coconut. There is no sour musky taste that is often associated with the vacuum packed waters. Also, ta da...the can is recyclable...a huge plus in my book.<br />I can't say enough about this product. It's delicious, healthy, refreshing, low-calorie.

review/summary: BEST Coconut Juice!
review/text: In the last couple of months, I have been on this adventure searching for the BEST and Natural coconut juice.  I have tasted many brands such as Vitacoco, O.N.E, and many other Asian brand.  Hands down Amy and Brian has the best taste out of all.  I was a firm believer Vitacoco was the best until I tried Amy & Brian.

review/summary: No additives, good size, good price
review/text: I've tried quite a few coconut waters - all of the major brands found on Amazon in addition to imports and the like. Most canned, "affordable" coconut waters (generally, what you find at the Asian and Indian supermarkets) have a preservative in it which really affects the taste. No chemicals here, and yet they still manage to keep the price competitive versus the average $2.79 for 11-12 oz at the grocery!<br /><br />Judging by past personal experiences, I don't think you'll find a consistent taste in a coconut water unless the supplier mixes it all together in a giant vat or something. It's a natural product, so slight variations are to be expected. That said, I've never had a coconut water from this brand which tasted "bad". Just different.<br /><br />The green can has pulp, which I prefer. One reviewer who gave this a low star rating cited the inconsistency in the pulp texture - some was soft, some was harder, chewier. If you've ever cracked open a young coconut after drinking the juice to scrape the pulp out, you'll have experienced the same variations. The pulp layer within is very thin and both textures are to be expected. I don't mind it that way - it seems like more of something to expect than something to be shocked by. Don't order it expecting the pulp to be like that of oranges! Coconut pulp is its own thing.<br /><br />Great for doing yard work, sports, and as a substitute for pedialyte/gatorade when someone's ill (though this does have some natural sugar content).

review/summary: FANtastic coconut water!
review/text: Most of us are dehydrated & don't even realize it. The effects on our organs, therefore, is usually not seen until there's a major problem, and of course we'd like to eliminate that possibility if we can. Enter coconut water.<br /><br />With all the potassium contained in a single serving (I drink the whole can in two sittings per day!), and electrolytes to replenish after structured exercise, sauna sessions or anything which causes you to sweat, this is the perfect solution from nature to correct the imbalance.<br /><br />I anxiously awaited my order and it arrived yesterday. I immediately popped open a can (it was slightly dented but juice was clear & delicious!) & enjoyed the delicious thirst quencher. I'm going to drink it daily for health food, whether or not I get my sweat on!!<br /><br />PULP: Others have noted dry bits of pulp & that they found this undesirable. I purposely crunched down on many of the tiny bits of coconut meat and found it juicy & tender - perfect consistency, and I enjoyed that it's included in this coconut water.<br /><br />PACKAGING: The case of cans was packed VERY well with many layers of bubble wrap, then the case with cardboard base was shrink-wrapped, but there was still a dent on at least one can thus far, so it must have happened at the packing facility, which is NOT Amazon's fault. No matter. I drank it immediately & it was perfectly delicious. I've got two chilling now, and put the can back in the fridge yesterday after pouring half in the first glass, and it's delicious either way. Room temp or cold - both amazing!

review/summary: Only decent with notable drawbacks
review/text: This coconut water was pretty good, although i wouldn't say it's remarkably better than Zico and certainly not better than VitaCoco.  The coconut chunks varied quite a bit with quality, ranging from tender and delicious to a little too thick and tough.<br /><br />Also, almost all of my dozen 17.5 oz cans were dented in some way, with one can being a little too compromised for me to consider consumption.  After reasonably extensive storage in my refrigerator, all of the remaining coconut waters acquired a distinct, unpleasant metallic taste.  Maybe this should be expected with a tin storage container, but I certainly don't get unpleasant tastes with tetrapaks and plastic bottles after extended refrigeration.<br /><br />Despite the overall pleasant drinking experience, I doubt I will be ordering again.

review/summary: Yummy & refreshing taste, healthful, a little expensive!
review/text: UPDATE (10/9/12):<br /><br />I asked the company on Facebook about how much magnesium and potassium are in each can, since it is not listed even though the can advertises having lots of both (?). Their reply was "about 676 mg Potassium and 29.12 mg Magnesium."<br /><br />---<br /><br />It seems that coconut water is one of those love-or-hate flavors that exist in the world (kind of like avocado).  There doesn't seem to be a middle ground, either you really dislike it, or really like it.<br /><br />I'm definitely in the really-like camp. And I had to get to this brand to discover that. I had tried both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0R8I">Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UUWECC">O.N.E. Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12)</a>, and found both of them insipid tasting.  But I find this brand refreshing and full of body.<br /><br />I compare the difference between "good" and "bad" coconut water to the difference between apple juice from concentrate and not from concentrate.  The former has a watery taste, like it's not the real thing, whereas the latter is more like drinking an apple.<br /><br />This brand seems more like drinking a coconut (although that's something I've never done). But it doesn't have the icky blandness to it that the above brands have.<br /><br />I also really enjoy the bits of coconut pulp, they had to the experience and taste.<br /><br />This makes a great base for powder mixes, especially flavored ones like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SG4NDI">Vega Whole Food Shake & Go Smoothie - Tropical Tango - 300g - Powder</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SFTJD8">Sequel Naturals Vega Shake and Go Smoothie Bodacious Berry -- 10.6 oz</a>, and even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HI1LSI">Garden of Life Perfect Food Raw Organic Powder Nutritional Supplement, 240 Grams</a>.<br /><br />It's also great to drink as-is, straight from the can, as both a pre- and post-hydrator.  I often drink half the can before a work-out and the other half after I'm done. If you research, it is best to pre-hydrate so your body has the extra fluids/minerals readily available as they are being depleted, rather than only hydrating after you are exhausted and dehydrated.<br /><br />This 12-pack will last you a long time, especially considering each can is two servings (~2 cups).

review/text: Amy and Brian and Taste Nirvana are the only two brands of coconut water I like. Both taste much sweeter and have a stronger coconut flavor/aroma than the rest I have tried. As to the drink being unnaturally sweet I frequently purchase young Thai coconuts at my grocery and the water tastes just as sweet. The price on Amazon is a little higher than locally available to me ($2 per can). The pulp pieces can be a little harder, but I enjoy chewing on them and feel like getting a meal.<br /><br />I like the way coconut water makes me feel and frequently drink one in the morning instead of coffee. It may be a sugar rush, but I definitely feel refreshed after that and the feeling lasts quite a while. Overall good product and tastes just as good as water you just got from a coconut.

review/text: I love the Amy and Brian Coconut Juice as an after workout refresher.  I do CrossFit which is a high intensity workout program.  This juice is great for rehydrating and it has tons of potassium to help with muscle recovery.  What sets this coconut juice apart from most other coconut juices you find in the grocery store is that it doesn't have any added sugar.  I'm very into eating natural foods and this juice is just 100% coconut juice, nothing added whatsoever.  There are other brands out there which are similar that I haven't tried so I can't compare this to others but I can say this brand has a great taste.  I also like the pulp but other people who have tried it say they prefer the non-pulp cans, it's just a matter of personal preference I guess.  Enjoy!

review/summary: The REAL Coconut Juice, the Healthier Alternative to Coconut Juice BLENDS with Sugar added.
review/text: If you have never drank coconut juice fresh from the coconut, you are missing one of Natures most refreshing drinks.  If your only experience is drinks served at Asian restaurants, you need to know - this is NOT the same thing.  Most places sell the cheaper - with sugar and water added - version of this drink.  I am so happy that AMY & BRIAN have stuck with the more expensive PURE coconut juice.<br /><br />It is definitely less sweet.  It will quench your thirst better.  You won't have to worry about the extra calories.  It's the real thing.  You will not want to share the can, so be sure to count all of the 2 servings of calories.<br /><br />I used to buy this by the case on Amazon, but sadly the price went way up (from $18) and I got cases with dented and leaking cans.  So $$ was not worth it.  I can not find it locally, and so am suffering with the sugary stuff again.  I wish the price would come down and shipping did not kill the cans.

review/summary: Sweet, delicious, and wonderful!
review/text: We have sampled a good number of different coconut juices from different companies and these Amy & Brian juices are the best, hands down. A number of the other brands had a bitter taste and/or after taste, or seemed watered down (lacked flavor). Amy & Brian's juice is sweet through and through, no nasty after taste, and reasonably priced.<br /><br />The only thing I think they could do better is to package the juice in a better container. It is somewhat annoying to drink the juice from the can due to the "tinny" taste and because the pulp pieces zip through the small opening, which is disconcerting. I just pour it out into a glass and enjoy it fully that way. Another brand we tried had a glass, wide-mouth container which was easy to drink from and cool because you can see the pulp pieces suspended in the drink. If Amy & Brian adopted packaging like that, it would improve the product by a lot!<br /><br />Still though, despite the packaging, this is THE BEST coconut juice out there that we have tried.

review/summary: So delicious!  Best tasting coconut juice I've tried (other than directly from coconuts)
review/text: I've tried a handful of coconut juices and -- in comparison with Amy and Brian's coconut juice -- they've ranged from meh to eh?!  For instance, the vitacoco juice has a slightly acidic/bitter tinge to it.<br /><br />But this Amy and Brian's coconut juice just tastes awesome!  And I love the little pieces of coconut.  Some may find it a bit awkward to "chew their juice" in a way, but I like the texture.  And the juice is sweet without being cloyingly so, with no odd aftertaste.<br /><br />I do wish this stuff was cheaper.  I could easily go through two cans a day, and that's a lotta moolah a month :\. So for now, I'm saving it for after or before boot camp workouts.<br /><br />But, despite the cost, I'll likely order this again.  Wonderfully refreshing!<br /><br />(CAVEAT:  Do keep in mind that this isn't exactly a "diet" beverage.  The 17.5 ounce can (which contains two servings) does contain 152 calories, which is about 9 calories per ounce.  But compare that against, say, Coke, which not only has a ton more (non-naturally-occurring) sugar and pretty much no nutritive value at all, but also packs 33% more calories per ounce.  Or orange juice, which has *66%* more calories per ounce :-o.

The water was great as usual, but the pulp was HORRIBLE the pieces of coconut were very soft and mealy. They didn't really taste bad, it was just the texture, yuk!

If you are thinking of buying this product I would find someplace to buy a single can and try it first, wish I had.

review/summary: Excellent coconut juice
review/text: I'm an avid coconut water drinker - I've tried most brands sold by Whole Foods and Trader Joe's and this brand is always consistent (flavor/color/freshness). If you enjoy coconut water you need to give this brand a try ...you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Always tastes good
review/text: This coconut water tastes good and is well priced. The best thing about it is that the taste is consistent. Many company's coconut water does not taste good on a consistent basis. I have tried many different coconut waters and this is my favorite. I also really like the little pieces of coconut meat in it. For anyone new to coconut water make sure whichever one you get that there is no added sugar. There is a lot of coconut water out there that has added sugar, aside from it being unhealthy coconut water does not need it. Natural coconut water has a slightly sweet pleasant taste.

review/summary: Dented, but Delicious
review/text: Some of the cans did show up a little dented, but that didn't compromise the product in the slightest. Amy & Brian is the best Coconut Juice on the market. By purchasing a subscription instead of going to my local CoOp, I'm saving a $1.20 per can. After my 2 cases ran out I bought some VitaCoco to hold me off until my next shipment and it paled in comparison.<br /><br />I just upped my shipment to 3 cases at a time and will probably push it to 4 cases next month.

review/summary: Good qualities overshadowed by odd taste
review/text: I pitted this against another leading brand of coconut water, but I'm not sure I would order it again. While there were undoubtedly some positive tasting qualities, likely owing to good practices and Thai sourced coconuts, these were considerably overshadowed by a metallic taste. I could only say I've known this taste before in... SpaghettiO's. Texture wise the pulp was also mushier, which has the benefit of a higher ratio of the rich, buttery bits, but I'm left wanting a hint of crunch somewhere. That's to be expected from young coconuts though, sought for their fruit rather than the mature nut. I favor a mix, which I at least believe I've found in two other brands. Another problem I found was these arrived in quite bad shape, the cans were variously dinged and punched in. The other guys' cans were too, except those were pressurized and so held up better. The real drawback for me was these practically require refrigeration. Now I'm well aware most people don't like room temperature coconut water, but I actually prefer it and regret to say I found Amy & Brian's too unpalatable to enjoy naturally.

review/summary: Addicting!
review/text: This is the best tasting coconut juice around.  It is so addicting that I cannot just drink one can; I have to drink at least 2.  It provides potassium and magnesium which are both necessary for our bodies.  I must be low on those nutrients because as soon as I take a sip of the juice, my body just craves and craves more.  Its not even the same craving as for sweets or junk food.  Its like my body is saying this is just what I needed and just sucks it down!  Yumm.  I enjoy the coconut juice with pulp because the one without pulp seems to taste odd to me. But try it out, you won't regret it.  Your body will thank you for the magnesium and potassium!

review/summary: Tastes Good to me
review/text: I am a relative new comer to the world of coconut water, and as such have not had a lot of experience with the variety of waters available. In fact, it was rather overwhelming when looking at all the varieties available.<br />Given the price of a case of water, it would be prohibitive to buy a case of everything and find the one I liked.<br />So I went to the local  health food store and bought single cans of everything they had.<br />Out of all of them, Amy and Brians with the pulp tasted the best to me.<br />I have never had the water directly out of a fresh young coconut, so I cannot vouch for its "Authentic" taste or anything like that.<br />It didn't taste overly sweet to me (the can even states that its unsweetened)<br />It tasted like coconut flavored water w/ pulp and that's what I was hoping for.<br /><br />As for some of the packaging issues mentioned in other reviews, someone must have been listening, because my case came superbly packaged with nary a dent.<br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Does NOT taste like milk from a bowl that had corn flakes!
review/text: Try all of the coconut juice beverages out there, and more and more, they are becoming to taste like the milk that is left over from your bowl that had corn flakes in it.<br /><br />This is the best tasting to date. Not artifically sweet tasting, but actually quite good. Slightly sweet, naturally, but not artifically with sugar.<br /><br />Get the type with pulp.<br /><br />Only negative I could say is that nearly every single can is dented. Some are dented so badly, that they are sqaure (4 sides are flat) when they are supposed to be round like a coke can. None were opened because of the damage but they were all dented.<br /><br />I am in the process of ordering more... Due the math. Other vendors like the Zico brand, give you less product (some are 9 oz and others are 12 oz, for 2.99 in the store), for more money. In other words, with most brands, you are getting less juice (which tastes like corn flake milk), which costs more. With amy and brian, you are getting more juice (which tastes like young sweet coconuts), with pulp, FOR CHEAPER. I know it sounds wierd but punch the numbers!<br /><br />:)<br /><br />Oops, almost forgot to order another case!

review/text: I recently got into drinking coconut juice.  I tend to be health conscious so I started using coconut juice in the smoothies that I make.  It adds such a light, refreshing and delicious zing to my smoothies.  Since discovering Amy & Brian's coconut juice, I love to drink it straight as well.  My favorite are the ones with the pulp.  They are a great alternative to sports drinks because of the amount of potassium inside and don't have any artificial sweeteners or colors.  I drink them after exercising and they help me from getting sore afterward.  I recommend this drink to everyone I know and they're surprised how good it tastes.  It's become as good as gold in my home lately.  Next time you're in the grocery store and see one of these, put it in your cart and remember that your body thanks you.

I went abroad and since I was enrolled in the auto delivery I received the second batch while I was away. I figured maybe the first batch was just a bad batch but once I opened the first can of the second batch, I still had that taste. I tried to do an exchange but I was not within the time frame.<br />My daughter says it could be because they're packaged in cans and she adviced I just switch to Vita Coco. I did order the Vita Coco 17oz and am very happy with it. Unfortunately it doesn't have the auto delivery that Amy and Brian has so I just have to put in an order every time.

review/text: I gave this one a shot when it was on sale and while I definitely couldn't complain about the price the taste was a little too sweet for my liking. I did like the pulp in the can, but when trying to down one of these a day I just couldn't do it. By the time I got through the entire 12 pack I could no longer bear the thought of having to drink the rest of them. This isn't to say that the product wasn't decent and I might be inclined to want to drink it again, once in a blue moon, i.e., very rarely; it just didn't have the same light refreshing properties that I have perviously found in other brands.<br /><br />As a once a month treat I could find myself enjoying this, but the overly sweet taste makes me refrain from wanting to consume anymore.

review/text: I found the pulp to be uncomfortably large chunks, that settled on the bottom. I also found this to be unnaturally sweet. (I have tried many different coconut waters; both packaged and fresh from the coconut.) The product lists far more carbs than any other packaged coconut water I have tried. Given these two things, I'm thinking it's likely this product is boiled, or otherwise condensed.  This may be good for those weaning off sugary beverages, but if you are looking for a coconut water that tastes like fresh from the coconut, this is not it.

It seems they must have filtered out the coconut fat at some point in the process, because there's no fat content.<br /><br />Definitely a good buy when it's on sale.  I think I'll try one of the pulp-free versions next time (maybe the one with lime).  I do like pulp, but the little cubes were too heavy to float as well as orange pulp--I had to give it a quick stir or shake to set the cubes in motion before drinking.<br /><br />I placed these in my fridge and always looked forward to having a tall, cool glass of coconut juice!

review/text: Juice by itself is delicious - the best coconut water out of the brands I have tasted (Zico, O.N.E., and VitaCoco).  Very pulp-y, which would be fine if the pieces were not so thick.  Took off another star for the severely dented cans. 9 of the 12 cans were dented, 7 were dented so much at the seam that I have chosen to discard them rather than risk drinking.  Would like to try pulp-free version, but nervous about the dented cans. Will stick with VitaCoco until can issue is resolved.

review/summary: Great cereal!
review/text: Wheat Chex<br /><br />I never imagined that our cereal would some day be delivered via UPS.  But, since Amazon's free-shipping price is lower than our local Safeway's nearly five dollars per box, that's where we get it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- It tastes great, even with the non-fat milk we've been using forever.<br /><br />- Dry cereals made from wheat are much more filling than those made from corn, rice, or oats.  I have to eat twice as much to be full, if the cereal is made from those grains.<br /><br />- It stays reasonably crunchy the entire meal, and I have a big bowl every morning.<br /><br />- It stays fresh in an opened box; although at the rate it's consumed around here, that's usually not very long.<br /><br />- It stays fresh in an unopened box for many months.<br /><br />- Good daily dose of fiber, although that's not the reason I eat it.<br /><br />- If you are a regular Wheat Chex customer, save 15% through Amazon's "Subscribe & Save" offer; prominently displayed on the product page.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- The inner bags used to be easy to open by hand, but the geniuses at General Mills now seal the plastic liner so completely, you'll need to cut it open.<br /><br />- Three decent-sized bowls of cereal is all that's in a box.  The smaller the package, the higher the cost per ounce of cereal.  I.e., if the box was 50% bigger, even though the box would cost slightly more, the cost per ounce of product should be less.  Apparently, General Mills is afraid sales would lag if a "box" of Wheat Chex cost any more.<br /><br />I've been eating this stuff for 50 years.  When I travel to a foreign country, one of the things I miss is this cereal.

review/text: You can eat this cereal out of the box or part of chex mix. But ever since I had been a little kid, I have also simply loved eating it with a big bowl of cold milk.<br /><br />Most cereals loose their flavor when soggy. Not this one! It actually goes the extra mile--picking up extra body. Eating it makes you feel full, but you obtain all of the essential vitamins. It is one of life's simple pleasures.<br /><br />And the 'store versions' of this product have never been able to successfully replicate the product unique taste, so don't even think about switching in this case. You'll just be cheating yourself!

review/summary: Best-tasting "major brand" cereal, but too little per box
review/text: I could eat this cereal every day, and sometimes I do. In the morning with raisins, at night with sugar sprinkled on top... it has been consistently excellent for years. This is simply the best-tasting cereal produced by a major brand. (The only better-tasting cereal in my opinion is "Heritage Flakes" by Nature's Path, which every Wheat Chex lover should try.)<br /><br />My only complaint -- which keeps it from being 5 stars -- is that General Mills reduced the amount of cereal per box a few years ago, in a shameless attempt to squeeze more money from consumers (which apparently worked). Today's box holds barely two bowls of cereal (if you eat a big bowl like me).  Shame on GM!  Your greed produces more boxes, more plastic bags, and more waste.<br /><br />Love the cereal, hate the company greed.

review/text: When I visit a Japanese restaurant, one of the things I always like is a small bowl of miso soup. Well, I was looking through the international food section in my local grocery store and I found these three-packet bags of Marukome Miso Soup Mix. All you needed to do was take one of the small packets and add a cup of hot water, stir and enjoy. So easy. Well, I was disappointed. It just didn't mark up. Well, what did I expect? It's just a little packet and hot water. There's no way it could mark up to a couple Japanese places I go. Actually, it's not really bad at all. The sodium content is much too high, of course, and the tofu just doesn't come through very well.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: I like it, but flavor may be polarizing
review/text: I can imagine that this cola flavor will have ratings all over the place, because it does not taste like most colas available. It doesnt even taste like the other Sodastream colas available (diet or regular). Most other colas will taste very similar to Coke or Pepsi, depending on which flavor profile the generic is modeling itself after.  This cola, however, tastes nothing like either and seems to have a unique flavor profile relative to the ones I've tried.  Its hard for me to pinpoint exactly what the differences are, but I believe that there is a less emphasis on the citrus flavors and more on the vanilla and cinnamon flavors.  I also notice a slight caramel flavor which is not typical of commonly available colas.  I don't think there is a shortcut way to find out if you'll like this... you'll just have to try it out.

review/text: I've tried all of Sodastream's regular sodamix flavors, and they're made with artificial sweeteners so I don't think they taste very good.<br /><br />This flavor (natural cola) is quite good. It doesn't have any artificial sweetener taste, and it has a nice cola flavor. Now, it definitely doesn't taste like Coke or Pepsi. I'd describe it as a fruitier Coke, provided that you use slightly less than the recommended portion to make the drink. And I think that's something worth mentioning: you can vary the level of sweetness by slightly altering how much of the mix you pour in to the bottle of carbonated water.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this flavor, I would definitely buy it again.

review/summary: Grossest cola ever
review/text: I've had the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T0GXNC">SodaStream SodaMix - Cola</a> before, and it was fine. It tasted like someone mixed a diet soda with a regular one with the slight aftertaste of sucralose, but it wasn't that bad, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T0NXK8">SodaStream SodaMix - Caffeine Free Root Beer</a> was one of the best root beers I've ever had even WITH that aftertaste. I gambled on the Natural Cola, hoping it would taste like the regular one but without that aftertaste, but boy was I wrong. It tastes like you took some apple juice and mixed it with cola.<br /><br />(The natural rootbeer, incidentally, is freaking awesome - it IS the  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T0NXK8">SodaStream SodaMix - Caffeine Free Root Beer</a> without the aftertaste.

review/summary: It can taste really good!! But you need the right recipe!!
review/text: This cola is really good! Yep, I gave it five stars!<br /><br />There's really only one thing to consider here, and that is cost. I'll get to that in a minute.<br /><br />So why do I think the reviews are all over the place? For one, everyone has different tastes. If we gave "real" Coke or Pepsi to 10 people, you will get many people who hate it. I like Pepsi Throwback myself, but to each his own. So yes, some people will hate this syrup. I'm not going to disagree with someone else's taste buds!<br /><br />But let me try to help those who have tried this and thought it wasn't very good. I can relate. Because that's what I thought at first too! Why? The answer is simple. The recipe on the bottle is really not very good.<br /><br />The recipe calls for 1 cap full of syrup and 6 "buzzes" of carbonation. I highly recommend you try 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cap fulls of syrup to 6 buzzes or even 7 buzzes. I like 7, but 6 was okay as well. Coke and Pepsi are VERY sweet. I thought about this, and added the extra syrup. The difference is like night and day. The additional syrup makes this taste much better to me, and much closer to what Coke tastes like.<br /><br />Now, one selling point Sodastream tries to make is cost. "25 cents per 2 liter!". Well this syrup, with the Natural Can Sugar, is twice the cost at major retailers of the standard Cola (the one that has Sucralose and Sugar). When you add in the extra syrup with my recommended recipe, you really aren't getting that much soda. I think I can get 6 liters of soda out of this with the new recipe. For $10 cost on the syrup alone, that's some expensive soda!<br /><br />But really, Sodastream for us is not about saving money. It's about kids and family having fun making their own soda. The novelty might wear off, sure, but we have given up worrying about the saving money part and are just enjoying the unit for the fun of creating our own sodas.<br /><br />PROS: Tastes great. Made only with natural sugars.<br /><br />CONS: Recipe needs to be altered to taste. If you use more syrup like I do, you aren't saving money versus buying Coke or Pepsi.<br /><br />Bottom line: this syrup tastes good if you alter the recipe and make your soda sweeter than called for on the bottle. If you aren't concerned with saving money on your soda and just with having fun with your creations, this is still a good buy.

review/summary: It's a caramel colored pop.
review/text: When you're out for dinner at a casual restaurant where you'll likely order a burger and a Coke and your server asks "is Pepsi okay?" What do you respond with?  If your answer is "Sure, Pepsi will do," or something along those lines, then you'll find this SodaStream Natural Cola syrup to be just fine.  It is not a Coca-Cola substitute.  It is along the lines of Pepsi in the glass bottle from Mexico which is made with cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup.  It's not as good as Pepsi hecho en Mexico, but it's not gross and disgusting like others make it out to be.<br /><br />I enjoy craft pop like most people enjoy craft beer.  Some of it is awesome, like Coke from Mexico and many of the Boylan and Goose Island flavors, and a lot of it isn't too good, like the under-mixed, under-flavored store brands that are only marginally less expensive than the national brands.  Being that this is my first experience with home-mixed pop, I'm delighted that it was much better than a store-brand.<br /><br />Mixing pop at home is not more economical than buying a case of Coke when it's on sale, but it certainly is a lot more fun, it's "greener," and you get to try a ton more flavors than you're used to.  It is about the same price as pop from the specialty items section, however, so if you're the explorer type, then you'll enjoy trying new syrups.

review/text: The flavor of this cola is a bit more herbal, kind of reminds me of Boylan's Cane Sugar Soda. If you are looking for something syrupy sweet you probably won't enjoy this. It is definitely more expensive than Soda Stream's usual reduced-sugar mix offerings, and also requires double the amount of carbonation to your water (5-6 buzzes). But definitely high quality and well-worth the money.

review/summary: Coca Cola clone, yeah it's that close.
review/text: The fact that this is made with cane sugar actually has very little to do with how good it tastes, or how much it tastes like Coca Cola. If you find it is a touch sweet, you can a. try using a little less syrup! And honestly, I suggest that you try this anyway because the cap this bottle comes with is huge. Or, b. try using more CO2 when you are carbonating your water. If neither of these suit you then c. doing both should help a lot.<br /><br />I like this flavour a lot. If you really want the closest thing to Coca Cola, this is as close as you will get without spending more for a huge cannister of actual Coca Cola syrup, the kind sold to stores and restaurants. For the price, I think most people will find this more suitable.<br /><br />As a final note I will say that although I love this flavour, I tend to prefer the other Cola syrup, the one that comes in a white bottle--even if only for its lower price. The breakdown to take away from these two types of soda (because I know this is why you are here), this Cola syrup tastes like Coca Cola, and the white (cheaper) bottle tastes almost exactly like RC Cola.

I think it's because I want it to be exactly the same and it's just not. My husband thinks it's great and he only drank DP occasionally. It could be that it's the same with this, if you drink one of the two leading brands almost exclusively you might not like it. I think you should give it a shot anyway.

review/text: This is 'my' opinion of this product.  I'm going off of what 'my' taste buds is telling me.  I won a Sodastream soda maker off of eBay and was excited.  Give me corn syrup and corn fructose.  I never liked that fake sweetener taste like aspartame and sucralose.  Those are some of the most unpleasant tasting sweeteners I've ever had.  I'm a huge Pepsi drinker and the price of Pepsi keeps skyrocketing so I decided I can make my own pop at home.  I wanted something that taste like Pepsi.  Until I can afford to buy Pepsi syrup this natural cola mix will have to do.  If anybody is looking to make their own pop and like the Coca Cola taste this will suffice you.

As for the seller, delivery was prompt and price was reasonable.  I definitely appreciate the seller's part of this, but I must say, the product is so-so.  It has a different taste to it; and is not an authentic cola taste.  For some reason, the taste seems to almost rob the cola of its carbonation.  That said, it is not super sweet, which is nice; and, it has no awful after-taste.  I don't think I would buy this product again; it depends what other naturally flavored colas I find out there.

review/summary: Curiosity Cola
review/text: This reminds me of Fentimin's Curiosity Cola which has a botanical undertone. I actually like it very much but if you are expecting Coke then you will be disappointed. Try it with an open mind.

review/summary: This is very bad!
review/text: I love SodaStream Zero and I love Pepsi Throwbacks (with pure cane sugar, when you can find them).  So I excited when I heard SodaStream was coming out with this flavor sweetened with cane sugar).<br /><br />This was the nastiest tasting flavor that I have had.  I hope SodaStream redoes this flavor.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: This is really good.  But as noted in some of the other reviews, it does not taste like Coke or Pepsi.<br /><br />I have to hand it to Sodastream for setting themselves apart by creating a cola with a unique flavor rather than simply trying to replicate one of the top cola brands.<br /><br />So far I really like all of the Sparkling Naturals flavors I've tried.  They're all unique in their own way and they really do taste like they're made from natural stuff.<br /><br />My only complaints are that they are not nearly as concentrated and only make half as much soda as the regular flavors, while being more expensive.<br /><br />And finally, Amazon needs to come down from the $14.99 price.  Bed Bath & Beyond has this in their brick and mortar stores for $9.99, which is still pretty expensive in comparison to the standard flavors.

review/summary: Not your usual cola.
review/text: If you're used to that cola from Atlanta or in the red white and blue can from New York, you're probably going to be disappointed with the taste.<br /><br />But is it an acceptable cola as colas go? Yes. I'd even say as a mixer, it'd be fine. There is a heavy aftertaste of carmelized sugar, and that does impact the taste of the cola itself but it is drinkable even if the folks used to Atlanta's finest despise it. Muddy it up with something like flavored syrup (cherry, vanilla, etc) or Rum and it isn't as noticeable.<br /><br />Also remember that with cola and other "dark" syrups, you have to increase the level of carbonation. I typically do 4-5 buzzes for the right amount of fizz.<br /><br />I'd put it above the tea taste of the Natural root beer as it's drinkable but still below the lemon/lime and Ginger Ale Natural flavors.

review/summary: tasty!
review/text: These are so tasty! I love banana with chocolate with anything. It is a very small bag of treat. I thought I can finish the whole bag when I bought one from Whole Foods Market. But, it was very filling and a few of those was satisfying enough. Maybe 3 to 4 servings in a bag. So, it is not so bad the price wise. However, at Whole Foods, it is $4.69 a bag. Here at Amazon, a bag is $5.54. It looks like a deal with pack of 3, it is not at all a deal. It is too bad the price is not even the same as at Whole Foods. This means it is super expensive at Amanzon!! I never thought of that. It is good to compare the prices...

review/summary: Very finely ground. Strong blueberry color and strong taste
review/text: Like all other products from Bob's Red Mill that I have tried, the quality of this flour is excellent. Very finely ground, no lumps at all, very fresh and always come in perfect packaging.<br /><br />The color of it seems almost white when the flour is raw but as you cook it, for some reason it becomes a whole lot darker. Even a tiny bit of it gives to any dish a strong blueberry-like color. That can sometimes look a bit unattractive if you are cooking for others. I made for instance a broccoli soup with broccoli, potatoes, chicken broth and I used this flour to thicken it. I only added a very tiny bit of flour, for a big pot of soup, but the whole thing turned dark purple. Now I guess a dark purple soup does not exactly match what most people would expect a broccoli - potato soup to look like lol. But fortunately I just cooked it for myself and I'm not really picky about how the food looks.<br /><br />It also holds a very strong, somewhat bitter taste. A little bit of this flour will not only be very visible in any dish but also you will be able to clearly taste the black beans. I was using Bob's Red Mill garbanzo flour before this, and that one, instead, had a very mild flavor and a very pale color.<br /><br />Personally, I will not buy this flour again because the color and especially the flavor are a bit too much for me (I will probably go back to the garbanzo flour or the white beans flour), but I still give 5 stars because I think it is the best you can realistically expect from a black bean flour.

review/summary: A little crunchy
review/text: While the packaging says that this is creamy, there is an unpleasant texture to it.  Almost like I'm eating peanut butter with ground egg shells in it.  I've had 'natural' nut butters before and have never experienced something like that.  The roasted flavor is a little overpowering.  Adding some agave and/or stevia helps with the roasted taste.

review/summary: Love the Natural Taste
review/text: I love the taste and texture of this nut butter.  It is not a creamy butter, but more crunchy with very small pieces of cashew.  It has a very cashewy taste!  Awesome on toast in the morning.  Only 2g of sugar in 2 Tbsp.

review/summary: Tasty popcorn that doesn't get stuck between your teeth!
review/text: Okay, maybe the heading exagerates just a tad... Red Popcorn has a MUCH more tender husk than regular popcorn does and when it pops, it explodes the kernel so well that the husks basically disappear.  When it pops, it looks pretty much like any other popcorn, except that the popped kernels are slightly smaller than usual.  The meet is white, but you can see the little bits of red kernel in them.  You would never know that the pretty, white popcorn you were eating started out red-colored if you hadn't seen it before popping.<br /><br />The flavor is great!  It smelled "toastier" as it was popping than other popcorns we've tried.  We tried it all different ways, with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good.<br /><br />We also liked the fact that it is grown by Amish people and are happy to support their efforts to raise their crops the "old way."  They believe in sustainable farming and a clean, wholesome way of life.  No ConAgra multi-national conglomerates here, just real, individual farmers making a living off their land.<br /><br />Great products raised and produced by real farmers.  What better reasons do you need to buy some of this really tasty popcorn!?

review/text: This is some "excellent" popcorn. It pops up very nicely and is "far and away" better than the "Orville" that you've been popping. Very fine, almost non-existent "hulls" when it pops. Easy on the teeth and a very "clean" taste.<br />Like "Mikey" says, "Try it, you'll like it".

review/summary: Not actually Amish popcorn...
review/text: I just want to point out that this is not actually "Amish" popcorn.  Look at the company's website-this is "Amish country" popcorn, meaning I guess that Amish live in the vincinity.  Note the lack of any mention of organic popcorn on it.  This is good popcorn, but don't fool yourself into thinking you're getting an organic/chemical free product, or one raised in small batches by Amish folk.  Clever wording strikes again!

review/summary: Best Popcorn on the Planet
review/text: This, and all the other Amish popcorn, could very well be the best popcorn on the planet (I especially like the red) I could never go back to the bland popcorn I used to buy at the market. Everyone should at least try this great snack!
