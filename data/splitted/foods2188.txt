review/summary: Wellness canned food has been a lifesaver for our cat!
review/text: Our cat, Isabel, has struggled with UTI and weight issues for years. After our vet recommended a wet food only diet, we experimented with a variety of brands (included Rx), but could never find a wet food that made Isabel feel full, and not spend the rest of the day begging us for more food.<br /><br />Then we tried Wellness canned food.<br /><br />Isabel loves it (but she loves anything that resembles food, so that's not a huge hurdle), but what is great about Wellness is it fills her up! And not only has she stopped constantly begging for food, she started to lose weight! Her dandruff is going away, she is no longer lethargic and has started to play again, and she generally seems like a happier cat.<br /><br />Now that her chronic UTI has finally cleared up, we give her mostly Wellness canned food with a little bit of dry food mixed in. This is still her primary source of food, and she is just as happy now as when we first made the switch.

review/summary: Great, but mind the smell
review/text: My cat loves this food, but this particular flavor, beef and salmon, is a bit strong when it comes to the smell. I had to wash my hands more than once to get the smell entirely off. Now the problem is that my cat reeks of fish, she smells like a walking tuna sandwich. If you're okay with that, by all means get it, but I'm going to avoid this one in the future because I can't stand her smelling like this all the time.

review/summary: Excellent product just when I needed it
review/text: We needed a high quality wet cat food to help our sick kitty get his appetite back, put on some weight, and get him into recovery. He had turned up his nose at a great many foods, including the expensive Rx stuff from the vet we were told no cat could resist. Well, Sylvester gave it a definite 4 paws down.  Then we discovered Wellness Chicken Formula Grain Free wet cat food. Sylvester loves this food. He is looking healthier, his coat is shiny, he is friskier and more playful, and all around seems a much happier cat. He meows for his food and races to his bowl when it is feeding time. I have ordered another 2 cases to stock my kitty pantry with this great food.

review/summary: Cats love the food, but no pull-tab top, and dented cans.
review/text: I appreciate being able to buy this larger, more economical size from Amazon.  However, I didn't examine the picture closely enough, because I was surprised to see that the cans were not pull-tab and I had to dig out a can opener.  Inconvenient, especially since I feed my cats in the laundry room in the basement, not in our tiny kitchen.  Five or six of the cans were dented (I ordered a total of 24), a couple pretty severely.  I'm not sure what the box went through with the shippers, but even the cans need better padding!

review/summary: The only Welleness food my cat refuses to eat.
review/text: This is the only variety of Wellness food that my cat refuses to eat.  It is also the only variety that smells horrid.  Most of the varieties actually smell good, especially the chicken or turkey flavors.  This one is nauseating.  In fact, the first can I opened smelled so bad that I thought the product was spoiled and opened a second.  Now, either both were spoiled or neither were and it just smells horrific.  Too bad, as the product isn't inexpensive (though this Amazon sale is, perhaps because it doesn't sell well??).

review/summary: Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health
review/text: The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

review/summary: High quality food
review/text: I did A LOT of research on cat food before adopting my cat. I decided to feed him only canned food, with occasional crunchy treats. At first he only ate Avoderm and Blue Wilderness (also very high quality) but after introducing Wellness, he will not eat anything else. He loves it. He is vibrant, healthy, energetic and happy!  Do yourself and your cat a favor, and feed him high quality food.  Avoid the typical grocery store brands.  Wellness is of course more expensive, but well worth it.  Your cat will live a long, healthy life.

review/text: We've been ordering Wellness for one of our cats who was diagnosed as insulin-dependent diabetic a few months ago.  After reading many reviews on the internet, we chose Wellness chicken and Wellness turkey canned products.  This has gone well enough.  We though we'd give him a change of taste, so ordered a case of the beef & chicken canned food.  He projectile vomited it all over the kitchen.  Maybe it's the beef, but the remainder goes to the local pound where it will hopefully be appreciated.

review/summary: The Best Money can Buy for your Cat, Next to Homemade - Revised for Turkey
review/text: I like to provide variety for the cats, however, I like to stick with single protein sources.  So in addition to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>, I also get this one to add on with a higher protein diet.<br /><br />I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.<br /><br />Edit to Add: I have revised my feeding schedule to reflect the recent Wellness Recalls.  Wellness is still a part of my rotation, but I feed different varieties of canned food during the foreseeable future.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a> (I had used it in 2007, and decided it wouldn't hurt them in a rotation.  Its the only wet food that contains some fish).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />PS - some have preferred to add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOR6">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Turkey & Giblets Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> to rotation, to keep the cost low in more multiple cat households.  It has no glutens, but does use meat by products.

review/summary: Feline health is feline wealth
review/text: My cat had been diagnosed as diabetic. After freaking out and learning how to home test blood glucose levels, a vet recommended that I switch his diet to all wet food and if possible a grain free (low carb) one. Most over the counter food has lots of starchy fillers and grains, particularly dry food. I decided on Wellness. A month and a half later, my cat is off insulin. He loves this stuff. His coat is like silk and he has the agility and mood of a cat much younger than his 13 years. He's gained back 2.25 of the pounds he lost at the height of his diabetes and is doing well. It's pricier than I'd like, but the health of my furry friend is worth it.

review/summary: Best canned wet food out there!  My cat loves it!
review/text: My cat is a very finicky eater, and so finding a good quality food that he likes was challenging.  Wellness turkey is literally the ONLY wet food he will eat!  He has been on it for about 4 years now.  In comparison to other wet foods out there (besides making it fresh at home) I doubt you'll find better quality in ingredients, and low ash content, which all of us cat parents know is important for urinary health. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price.  It is a more expensive food and I do wish they would lower the price a little.  I will continue to buy this from Amazon since it saves me a few dollars versus buying it here in town.  Regardless of price, I would never switch to a cheaper food with cheaper ingredients that would threaten the health and well being of my cat and probably just cost me more money in the long run in vet bills.  So really you can justify the cost of this food and once again you can't beat the quality!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  CAT APPROVED!

review/summary: Diarrhea 2 for 2
review/text: Gone through only four cans and it looks like I'm going to have to trash the remaining 20.  Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction.  One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything, this food not only gives him diarrhea but seems to reduce his appetite for his hard food which he usually munches on throughout the day.  I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.  But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it.  Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress. From now on I'll be buying individual cans at the pet store first before I jump the gun and buy a whole case online.

It's grade A food, that is actually MADE IN THE USA!!!  You'd be surprised how hard this is to find (e.g. Weruva is made in Thailand).  I only wish they didn't use BPA in their cans.  My cats loved the turkey flavor for a very long time.  However, as with all foods, they got sick of it eventually.  So now I rotate between Turkey & Salmon, Chicken & Herring, and Chicken and Beef.

After getting reminder notices to reorder I decided to give it another try a few months later.  The quality was excellent and the food was really moist and fresh - perfect, my cats loved it!  After receiving about four good quality product shipments, the fifth one that I currently received is back to being dry and chunky instead of moist and creamy and my cats won't eat it.  How can the product be that inconsistent???  Very disappointed.

review/text: All of my cats LOVE the Wellness canned foods ... and I love the ingredients and quality.  The turkey flavor is in my cats' top 3 favorite canned foods.  When Amazon offered Super Saver Shipping on Wellness, it was practically the only thing I would buy because the price made it a no-brainer.  I've had to branch out some since it has become more difficult to find online (and I can't buy it locally in my remote location), but I still get it whenever I can.

review/summary: Wellness Turkey canned cat food
review/text: Wellness cat food has a great reputation. I have 5 cats and it's hard to please all of them, but I find all of them eat this food.  I know it's a tad more expensive, but I feel good knowing that they are getting a good food - good tasting and good for them, too.  AND I do feel it makes a difference with their coat and skin. The delivery was shockingly fast - and reason cost.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Not to my cat's taste- but adding warm water helped
review/text: I purchased this cat food after reading glowing recommendations from two or three different cat nutrition websites. One site did offer the caveat that while the quality of this brand was excellent it would not help the cat's diet if he refused to eat it and the reviewer's experience was that some cats would love it and others wouldn't touch it. My cat was somewhere in the middle - he didn't love it, but he would sometimes leave it half-eaten and the rest would dry up.<br /><br />My 8 year old cat is new to canned food - he has been fed a diet of 99.5 percent dry food since we adopted him as a half-grown kitten. (The other .5 percent he obtained himself from ferns and the occasional mouse. After reading an article about the nutritional needs of cats, I discovered that our rotund feline was getting too many carbohydrates and not enough protein, and I began adding canned cat food along side his daily bowl of dry food. I have tried a few different brands to find something that suits him.<br /><br />The Wellness canned cat food (I purchased the chicken and herring formula)has a pate-texture and I think this was my pet's primary objection to it. After trying several different canned foods, I find that he prefers more of a filet in gravy style preparation.<br /><br />When I first gave this to my cat I simply plopped the chunk of food into his bowl - leaving it largely in a solid can-shaped blob. Later, I began to add a half-can of warm water to the bowl and mix it up to make a thinner mush. Using this method, he seems to do fine with it, so I may or may not purchase it again.

review/summary: Completely worth the price.
review/text: Is Wellness relatively expensive? Yes. Is it worth every penny? ABSOLUTELY, yes.<br /><br />As new cat owners, my husband and I wanted to make sure our two newly adopted cats would get the best care possible. After spending hours researching pet foods on the internet, I was completely shocked (and disgusted!) to find out how terrible the cheap grocery store brands of food really are. It didn't take long for us to settle on Wellness because of its premium ingredients and stellar reputation.<br /><br />Thankfully, our cats LOVE this food. They're happy, and we're happy because it's so good for them! We gladly spend the extra money to ensure the health and well being of our two furry children. They love the turkey, chicken, and turkey/salmon varieties, which are all grain free. Turkey is their favorite, which is why I'm posting the review here. :)<br /><br />If you want your cats to eat great food, try Wellness. We are SO glad we did!

review/summary: Pricey, but well worth it
review/text: There is a feline diabetes epidemic out there.  My cat was self-feeding dry food (Purina Urinary Tract Health) which has a huge proportion of cereal carbs.  When she developed diabetes the vet advised adding Science Prescription Diet DM wet canned foot to augment the dry.  She needed less and less insulin and finally we were told she didn't need it at all. Still letting her self-feed the Purina dry foot while feeding her the wet canned, she had a relapse.  I decided to toss the Purina and just feed her the wet food and she's been fine for almost a year now.  I'm hoping she'll remain diabetes-free for the rest of her life.<br /><br />The Wellness food, labeled "Core," is very low carb and both my cats love it!  It contains a lot of water ("no more than 78%" is what the label says -- kinda expensive way to keep your cats in water ;)<br /><br />I justify the expense by accepting that my cat would be needing $100 vials of insulin, plus frequent vet checks of her blood. Instead I'm spending the money on food.<br /><br />As a side note, our other cat without diabetes loves this food, too.  She had urologic problems, was always licking herself, and used to smell really, really bad. She's doing super now and I attribute it to the wet, cereal-free food.<br /><br />I highly recommend working with your vet to wean your cat off dry cereal foods, especially if they're diabetic.  The Wellness canned food is fantastic and might save your kitty's life!

review/text: I feed several Savannah Cats, all of which can be very picky eaters. Everyone wants something different and if I change anything about their diet they get upset stomachs.<br /><br />I bought Wellness food trying to get them all to eat the same thing. I was simply amazed. As I gave it to them one by one they loved it. Even my 2 biggest picky eaters ate it right up. I watched closely for any upset stomachs and nothing. They all accepted the food with no issues.<br /><br />I was a little worried at first as to how much they ate as it could be expensive, but within a few days they leveled themselves out. I am just thrilled with the food and their reactions. I will promote this food to all my new homes. The food smells good enough to eat. Hum, wonder how my husband would like to try a new dish tonight :)

review/summary: Great Option For Diabetic Cats!
review/text: My 14 year-old cat was diagnosed with Diabetes and Chronic Renal Failure earlier this year; it was devastating. I had to administer insulin shots to him twice a day and twice he had hypo-glycemia due to the enormous challenge of balancing insulin levels. Worse, he was miserable and wary of me.<br /><br />At 16 lbs, he was overweight even for a large frame cat so I promptly began an intensive internet research (agree with the earlier poster who cautions against the foods prescribed by vets and sold in grocery stores) and after narrowing the field of high-protein pet foods, decided to try wet food. I was nervous because I had been guilty of feeding my baby delicious, awful-for-him dry foods (I was clueless) so I had no idea how long the transition to Wellness wet would take.<br /><br />There was no transition: He loved the food immediately and the switch was painless. Best, he lost 4 lbs in about 6 months, his blood sugar has stabilized and he's off insulin, hopefully permanently.<br /><br />Wellness isn't cheap, but when compared with the cost of losing a beloved furry member of the family too soon, the price is well-justified!<br /><br />ps. Maximillian's favorites are the chicken and the turkey. Vary for best results!

review/summary: Wellness Grain-Free canned cat food
review/text: When my female cat came down w/pancreatitis a few years ago (to the tune of $1000), I started researching what her diet should include.  My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.  Also, I noticed on the can that corn was an ingredient.  I asked her about this, considering corn is a sugary veggie and she also wanted Gracie to lose about 3-4 lbs.  She told me that the main idea was to have her eat a canned food that was 8% or less in carbohydrates IN A DRY STATE.  That means, they take the food, dry it out and get the true percentages of carbs, etc.<br />When I did some research on the web about pancreatitus in cats, I found that GRAIN in cat food can bring on and/or aggravate the condition. I read many articles that explained that cats DON'T NEED grain in their diet.  Pet food manufacturers put it in there because it sounds good to us, the pet owners, when we read that the food contains brown rice, etc.  But what's good for us, as we all know, isn't always good for them.<br /><br />I looked at many companies that made Grain-Free food and was very impressed w/Wellness.  They have many varieties that are grain-free.  When I called them to get the percentage of carbs in a dry matter basis, they were prepared and quick to answer w/out having to transfer me 10 times.<br />The food is not inexpensive, but my cat REALLY likes it.  This bout w/pancreatitis occured about 4 years ago. She has been on Wellness ever since and is in excellent health. She is now 14 yrs old.<br /><br />I highly endorse this product.  If I get another cat someday, I will feed her grain-free food from kittenhood.<br />BTW, they also make grain-free dry food, but I haven't tried it.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />Allie

review/summary: Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health
review/text: The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

review/summary: Awesome Cat Food
review/text: Being new to raising kittens, I have tried a variety of canned foods in recent months.  Although my kittens readily took to the Fancy Feast brand, it is not the most healthy of foods - my biggest concern being the by-product content.  I thought I would never get them off of that kitty krack!  However, MUCH to my surprise, they absolutely love this food and ate it readily the first time.  And the best part is that it is a very healthy food - no grains, no by-products.  There is a little gravy in the bottom of the can so I put a little bit of water in, give it a swirl, put it on top of the food - and whalah - instant broth and MORE water for my babies to lap up which is so vital for avoiding UTI's.<br /><br />I just can't say enough - good - about this product.  Thank you, Wellness.  My kittens are happy and that's all that matters!!!

When even my non-picky cat wouldn't touch any of it, I knew something was not right with this food. They refused to eat any of it. I like the premise behind the food, all natural and grain-free, but I am going to have to go back to the prior food my cats like. Hopefully my local animal shelter can make use of the food for their cats, if they even eat it.

review/summary: Great food, but...
review/text: ...lousy packaging/storage.  While the food itself is wonderful and the cat loves it, Amazon really made a mess of my order.  When the cans were opened, the contents had separated into solid and liquid.  We tried to mix it together again, but the cat refused it.  I email the company and sent a picture along and they said it had been subjected to extreme heat and had cooked in the can.  It wasn't hot locally, so I believe it happened while in Amazon's hands.  Additionally, Amazon has been less then helpful in processing the return.<br /><br />So, buy the food for your cat if it likes it, but just not from Amazon.  Get it from a company that handles food products regularly; they probably know a lot more about keeping products edible.

review/summary: My cats now love it!
review/text: I have two cats, one under 1 year old and the other is 4 years old. After researching about proper cat diets, I realized that they needed a good grain-free meaty canned food. Wellness fit the bill. The younger cat ate up the chicken flavor instantly and loved it! The older cat however, refused to eat it at first. She was used to eating dry kibbles and occasionally canned fancy feast. She kept refusing to eat the Wellness and I caved in and let her finish the bag of kibbles. Only when we didn't have any other food than the canned wellness did she approach it. So once she was good and hungry, and the younger cat was in another room, she crept out and started eating it!! Now she loves it and eats the chicken flavor with no problem. I haven't tried out the other flavors, but since I had such a hard time getting her to come around to eating it in the first place, I've been feeding them both the chicken flavor exclusively. If your cat won't eat Wellness, be patient and get rid of their previous food so when they get hungry they only have one choice. Mixing the old food with the new one wasn't as successful as just waiting it out. Their coats are super shiny and they are both at a healthy weight on a wellness diet.

She seemed pretty healthy before as well, but there was a noticeable difference after I switched her food.  Her coat is shinier and softer, she's more energetic, and has been maintaining a good weight.  I wish it wasn't so expensive, but I think its worth the price and I will keep buying it.

review/text: I ordered the Wellness Turkey to create a rotation for our kitten with Felidae grain-free formula. Until tonight he had only eaten Felidae, but when I opened a can of Wellness he went crazy for it! This will definitely be a part of our food rotation. Very high-quality food, mostly protein from excellent meat sources.

review/summary: Better than most canned food but still BAD
review/text: I have a cat who had serious intestinal issues. I needed a canned food that was grain free and also I need a protein that was not chicken - I had to start my cat on a novel protein. I bought this on the recommendation of a veterinarian (L. Pierson) on her web site, for so called "acceptable" canned food, because it is grain free. However if you read the ingredients list, it contains other ingredients that the same veterinarian says are allergenic to cats (e.g. carageenan). Also, even though its name claims it is "Turkey", (the turkey was supposed to be the novel protein for me) the ingredients list lists chicken and chicken parts as its 2nd, 3rd and 4th ingredients. It also has the same type of thickeners, fillers, and "flavoring" that all the other run of the mill canned pet food has.<br /><br />I originally gave this a 3 star rating (because it doesn't contain grains), but as I typed my review I was reminded of the deception and it made me change it to a 2 star.

review/summary: Positive for Wellness
review/text: My background is 50 years of dog/cat owner and college degree in chemistry so I'm not completely ignorant about pet nutrition. After a few days of Google research and reading pet food negatives and positives, I decided on a mix of Wellness both wet and the dry exclusively for my two rescue/shelter kitties based on reviews and availability. Price was not a deciding factor. After 1-1/2 years, they still gobble it down and I'm pleased to report both kitties mental and physical health to be outstanding with shiney, smooth coats, regular bowel movements, and healthy, energetic activity. I contribute this good fortune mostly to their diet of Wellness and a loving home environment although my billfold wouldn't mind if it were a bit cheaper. In my experience, Wellness has been outstanding.

review/summary: None of our cats would touch it
review/text: We have been transitioning our 4 cats over from the crap Purina makes to Wellness, and for most of the flavors, they love it. They like it much better than Friskies. Yesterday was the first time we tried the Salmon and Trout flavor, and absolutely none of them would touch it. They left it in their dishes all day and went hungry.<br /><br />I'll still give it 3 stars, because overall Wellness is better than anything else out there. Just be sure to test out the different flavors on your cats before committing to any bulk orders.

review/summary: Fresh and delicious
review/text: My two cats will eat anything. So why do I even care what they eat? I care because it's about their health and it's a important responsibility I accepted when I adopted them. This Wellness Canned food is very fresh and (according to the experts) has all the healthy nutrition cats need. I've tried a few different brands and this one gives my cats the best soft, full coat and even makes their poop smell less (super bonus!). It's pricier, but give it a shot.

review/summary: Interesting.  I"m still trying it out.
review/text: 24 cans come in a case.  I am caffeine sensitive, so it has been interesting getting used to it.  There is no added caffeine, just the caffeine from the chocolate.  The first day I took it, it made me feel a little sick, but I had tons of energy.  I gradually have learned that just 1/2 can a day works best, but by the end of the week, the effect wears off.  So I stop drinking it on weekends.  This, however, leaves me feeling very tired and groggy with a slight head ache.  But on Monday I drink 1/2 can and have all that energy and focus again. I'm still undecided if this is what I will continue.  I don't know yet if it has addictive properties.  I don't like taking anything I'd get addicted to and have withdrawals getting off it.

review/summary: Once Again Sunflower Seed Butter is the absolute BEST!!!
review/text: I love this stuff!!!  It is so much better than any other brand we have tried.  Probably because it is roasted and has sugar in it, while the other brands are mostly raw.  I'm sure the raw versions are healthier, but in this case, I consider it an indulgence!  Another reason that we prefer this over any other "sun-butter" is that it comes in a glass jar, while all the other sun-butters seem to come in plastic jars. I like the flavor of this even better than almond or cashew butter.  When I could find the Once Again Sunflower Seed butter locally, I would stir in coconut oil and that made it even yummier!<br /><br />Unfortunately my local grocery store stopped carrying it a while ago, and the shipping is rather expensive to order it direct from Once Again.  I wish Amazon would start carrying it (not just through a sub-seller).

review/summary: great smooth clean matcha tea but what will the Amazon price be?
review/text: This morning I reviewed 2 ORGANIC matcha teas, side by side:<br /><br />1.  The first one was: "2nd harvest Organic Domatcha" tea that I purchased at a local farmer's market, and I paid $37.99 for this 2.82 oz tin. Result = 4.5 stars (greatest taste and foam, organic, very expensive)<br /><br />2,  The second one was "SerendipiTea matcha culinary grade organic green tea" which I ordered on amazon.com, paying only $17.99 for a whopping 4 oz. bag. (twice as much for half the price).  Result = 5 stars (great taste, good foam, organic, terrific cost)<br /><br />**NOTE: see another review of SerendipiTea by me, beside 2 other brands.  It won in that review as well.<br /><br />I made the 2 cups identically, using soymilk and water 50/50, using the Blaney method (described below):<br /><br />"Blaney" Method for making Green Tea Latte:<br />You need 2 small sauce pans on a gas stovetop, latte foamer device, bamboo whisk, soymilk, water, teaspoon measure, � cup measuare, and matcha powder.  (many prefer sweetener and I suggest Agave syrup but I did not use it in this test since I enjoy the pure unsweetened tea flavor.  Cheaper teas may require the sweetener to mask any fishy tastes, but not these two high quality brands.)<br /><br />1. Using the latte foamer device, please foam 1/2 cup (cold or tepid) soymilk, then heat it gently while stirring (this personal "Blaney" method of mine makes the best foam)<br />2. heat 1/2 cup water (in separate pan) til boiling<br />3. add 1 level tsp matcha to 1/2 c. heated water and wisk with bamboo wisk about 30 seconds in zig zag motion  until matcha powder is dissolved<br />4. add the heated, foamed soymilk to the matcha/water blend<br />5. pour this mix into latte device, pump 20 or so times, then pour entire foamed mixture into large mug.<br /><br />For this test I made the two teas simultaneously so the `foamed' structure would be nearly identical (one is supposed to drink the latte immediately before the foam dissipates). I did, however, rinse the items with filtered water before pumping the second tea, so as to not to contaminate #2 with #1.<br /><br />For photo of the 2 teas and boxes, see:  [...]<br />Result:<br /><br />>>>Taste and texture:<br />DoMatcha won for a (very slightly, barely noticeable)  cleaner taste, and better 'foam'. However, the SerendipiTea was still very yummy.  I have the most sensitive taste buds on earth (other than my son) and I detected a very mild "ocean" taste with the Serindipitea, but I attribute that to the fact that my SerindipiTea had been opened a week prior.  The DoMatcha had only been opened the day before.  Newly opened teas always taste best. I would love to repeat this test in the future with two newly opened teas so that oxygen exposure won't be a variable as it was here.<br />&lt;&lt;&lt;Price:<br />Well, the DoMatcha 2nd harvest organic costs 4 times more, and is only ever-so-slightly better, and if I re-test with two new, unopened packages, who knows? Maybe they will be the same.<br /><br /> I am giving the SerendipiTea organic  5 stars for being such a cost bargain, being organic, and tasting so great...  and I am giving  the DoMatcha 4.5 stars for also being organic and tasting great, even fantastic, but being such a high cost.<br /><br />Carol Blaney, Ph.D.

review/summary: My Winning Matcha!
review/text: I've tried quite a few different types of Matcha in the last few months and this one is my favorite! I wouldn't call myself a connoisseur or anything but to me this one has the best flavor and price combination. I tried the SerendipiTea Matcha and I just couldn't get past the bitter taste... no matter how cheap it was. True this one is pricier but its cheaper than the DoMatcha first harvest (taking into account that this is a 2.82 ounce tin and the first harvest comes in a 1.08 ounce tin) and tastes just as good. Basically it has all the elements I'm looking for: smooth taste, organic, and at least a little cheaper than some of the other options.

review/summary: Brilliant green!  Worthy substitute for more expensive 1 ounce tins...
review/text: I felt like I was taking a leap of faith when I decided to try this. I have been a long time buyer of Eden Organic Matcha, but it was just getting too expensive for me to drink daily using 1/2 to 1 tsp per day.  The first replacement I tried out was a "culinary" grade tea by SerendipiTea.  I wasn't sure what to expect from it, but figured I would at least be able to put it into smoothies if I totally hated it.  I totally hated it.  The Eden Matcha was a beautiful, vibrant green while the SerendipiTea was almost brown.  Blech.  And the flavor....I couldn't even handle it in a smoothie, it tasted like dirt and made everything I put the tea in taste like dirt.  I was a little gun shy after that because Matcha is just so expensive and very difficult to find organically grown.  The DoMatcha seemed to be my only other option.  I am glad I finally took the plunge because it is a good substitute for the Eden brand.  I get almost three ounces for a similar price as 1 ounce of Eden.  I was happy as soon as I opened the bag inside the tin....the powder is a gorgeous emerald color.  It doesn't taste quite as good as the Eden (a bit more pungent and grassy), but it is good and I feel the same sense of vitality and cleansing I got from the Eden tea. I am a happy camper.<br /><br />NOTE:  I do not prepare and drink this Matcha in a traditional way. While I love green tea (and tea of all kinds), I drink Matcha specifically for the health benefits of consuming the whole tea leaf and don't muck around with water of a specific temperature and bamboo whisks. I add 1/2 tsp to cool water first thing in the morning in a shaker cup and shake vigorously. To me it is a lovely, frothy way to start my day.  I also put a bit in my smoothies.

review/summary: Gives Me More Energy, Mental Clarity and Stamina
review/text: The very first time I drank Matcha tea, it made such a huge transformation in how I felt that I haven't let myself be without it since.  That's been about a year ago.<br /><br />I've tried one other brand--from Colorado, a gift from my sister--also the 1st Harvest Organic and 2nd Harvest non-organic in this DoMatcha brand, through Amazon. I like the DoMatcha brand best, with the flavor and effect of the 1st Harvest Organic being my favorite.  It's the Ceremonial grade made from younger leaves. It's the most expensive, though, and costs too much for regular use in my case.<br /><br />The flavor is secondary for me. The main reason I drink Matcha is that it has helped greatly with the mental fog, extreme lack of energy, and difficulty functioning and handling stress that I was experiencing.<br /><br />This 2nd Harvest Organic does the trick pretty well, and is an acceptable balance between expense, flavor, and beneficial effects. I look forward to having a cup after breakfast every morning and enjoy the flavor, but truthfully, I wouldn't care what it tastes like. ;D

Out of all the powder green teas I have tried during allergy season this brand has the best allergy suppressing affects of all which means it has the highest egcg content of them all. egcg is the primary anti allergen in green tea.

There is not one hint of bitterness and it mixes up like a dream.  I actually wake up want my DoMatcha rather than coffee!  I feel great and have noticed a difference in my skin.

review/summary: 2nd Harvest organic variety - tastes just like the regular organic matcha
review/text: Started drinking the DoMatcha organic variety around 2008. I thought the DoMatcha organic 2nd Harvest variety would be bitter or inferior/flat tasting since you get more for your money ounce for ounce.  Finally tried the 2nd Harvest variety a few months ago and I cannot tell the difference; it is just as smooth and flavorful as the more expensive (ounce for ounce) regular DoMatcha organic matcha.

review/text: My friend turned me onto matcha last year and since then it has been a regular part of my healthy lifestyle.  It can be quite expensive.  By ordering this organic 2nd harvest 2.82 size and having it sent automatically each month (let's me save 15%) I feel I am getting an excellent value, especially since this is organic tea.  I whisk with hot water to enjoy in the traditional way, or I add it too my smoothies.  Also makes great green tea latte and can be added to an eggnog for the more adventurous.  Even mixed into plain Greek yogurt w/ a bit of sweetener like molasses is nice.

I've used the organic green tea for a year now, it's better than any other cheaper powder...you get what you pay for!

review/summary: I love this matcha
review/text: I have always been a matcha fan, but this one in particular is one of my obsessions. The other reviews do a great job of going into detail about the flavor profile of this stuff. All I have to say is it gives me clarity and clean energy that blows a coffee buzz out of the water. It makes me feel healthy and alert at the same time. I use the traditional whisk and add in a little agave if I want it sweeter. Also, sometimes if I want a creamy treat, I'll heat up some soy milk and use the whisk to make it foamy and creamy and pour it on top for a latte. The fact that its organic is a big bonus too!!! I'm not a big fan of the packaging because I feel like the canister doesn't create an ideal seal. And I'm afraid to dump the bag out into the canister since I know I'll make a huge mess and waste precious matcha. I basically wake up excited knowing a hot cup of matcha is in my near future! lol...

review/text: Do not know a lot about this type of tea, so couldn't compare it to other brands. I can say the product is rather strong tasting, but not unpleasantly so. Since a portion is pretty small, that is not much of a problem anyway. I purchased it after reading about its many health benefits. It does open my eyes in the morning, so the caffeine in it is really nice. As recommended by others, I keep it in the refrigerator inside the tin, in its original package, and it's kept fresh-tasting for a couple of weeks now. The color is very bright green, and it does taste healthy--hopefully, it is.

I believe I am already receiving all the benefits I could possibly see from this tea from my vegan diet, hence why I didn't feel much change. But my coworker tried some and absolutely loved it, and seen all the added benefits immediately.<br /><br />I of course will continue to enjoy this tea because I bought it and SHIESK! Its quite pricey! But I don't believe I will be splurging on this as much in the future, based off my current eating habits.<br /><br />ALSO!!! Here's a great tip to all those who do purchase this. I expected the tea to be inside the tin case. When I opened it there was a bag inside. LEAVE THE TEA INSIDE THE BAG!!!! I poured the bag into the tin for easier access but it made a huge mess and I winded up wasting quite a bit. And this stuff is extremely messy to clean up. It stained my fingers and desk green.<br /><br />Also, the can is not air tight, so it will come pouring out even with the lid closed.<br /><br />Yea yea, ....ha ha, ....everyone point and laugh at me.<br /><br />I hope you can all learn from my mistake.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: Of the options available, I purchased these sticks from this seller because reviews said they arrived intact.  Not so in my case.  The box did seem to be well packed and was surrounded in bubble wrap, and the top layer of sticks were unbroken.  However, as I went through the box i discovered that 28 of the 80 were broken.  I needed them for a holiday project and am now short almost 30 sticks.  Candy Crate says they will refund me 30% of the item price, but that's not going to cover the $10 I paid for shipping on the theory that it would save me from having to go all over town to find peppermint sticks - I have to do that anyway now, and have a very short time to do it.  Disappointing.

review/text: The product tasted good but 2 boxes worth arrived broken.  Since this was to be given as a reward, it was disappointing to have so many broken.  There was not time for returning them.  They were to encourage students to do well on their end of grade exams. I paid a fortune for nine boxes with so many broken.

review/summary: it is tough to chew
review/text: I got Teriyaki pack which is an ok flavor, I feel it is on the salty side. The main problem is the shape and texture of the meat. I dont get it why it is made it into the same size strips? that seems unnatural. The only possible answer I can think of is they try to cover up the low quality and different part of meat they mix together, so the texture is somewhat disgusting as the result. Every piece of the jerky is hard to chew, they should have trimed the meat and removed the membrane, but they did not, so you can taste that and chew on that forever. I had to spit it out eventually.

review/summary: Not real jerky and high in sugar
review/text: First of all, this isn't real jerky - it is reconstituted beef sticks (similar to the products labeled as "beef steak" by the national jerky brands). Second of all, it is high in sugar - 7g per 1oz for Original. I was extremely disappointed with this "jerky" - both for its deceptive labeling and for its lackluster taste.

review/summary: Delicious, fine texture.
review/text: I've never been a beef jerky fan.  But suddenly, in college, I found myself craving beef jerky!  Because I didn't have my dehydrator, I had to buy some from the store.  One of my roommates said that Hi-Country tasted great and was priced the best - and he was right!  Now I can't get enough of this stuff!<br /><br />It's made from strips of beef steak, as opposed to ground or super tenderized beef.  So it is a little tough after a few days, but it's really not that tough.  You can bite right through it in one direction, or you can chew on it for a while the other direction.<br /><br />The seasonings and marinades are just right and super tasty.  You can't go wrong with the original recipe, or you can go for an extra kick with the peppered.  I'm not a fan of Teriyaki, so I can't comment on it.<br /><br />Now for my only complaint: sometimes you get a hunk of fat that you just can't chew through.  It happens maybe once or twice per 1 lb. bag, but it's still there.  Otherwise, the jerky is just right.<br /><br />Give this beef jerky a fair shot.  Chances are you'll like it and you won't be going back to your old brand any time soon.

review/text: The High Country Jerky is very good, not overly spiced, not overly dry, and tastes great. Most jerkies today are made with so much salt and soy that you can't taste the meat for the spice; not so with the HC Original. If you like real beef jerky where you can taste the beef, HC Original may be your ticket.

review/summary: taste the chemicals, not the beef
review/text: I should have the read the label more carefully, but the packaging and talk of Montana took me in. Made in the USA means that beef was turned into jerky in the USA, not the cattle were necessarily raised in the USA, though they might have been. But the real complaint is the flavor, which seems to be the taste of preservative and MSG with some hard-to-identify spice and unconvincing hickory flavor. This is a relatively dry jerky which you have to chew -- but that's a good thing in my view since that's how "real" jerky is. But "real" jerky isn't overcome with preservatives and enhancers.

review/text: I just received this product and was surprised to see that the bags were not hermetically sealed, just plastic-lined paper bags folded over at the top. Here are some tests I used: Aroma  upon opening the bag - not so much smell at all; Aroma after grinding - not too much smell at all; Packs firmly in the espresso machine - NOPE; Crema after brewing - fair; First sip - YUCH!!! I admit I am somewhat of a coffee snob as I prefer the taste and aroma of FRESH coffee. I recommend you stay away from this stuff unless you believe instant coffee tastes good. This IS better than instant coffee but that's as far as I can go. I'm disappointed.

review/text: This might be a good coffee if purchaced fresh, but due to poor packaging I was unable to properly judge that assumption.<br /><br />This coffee is packaged in unsealed (not airtight) bags.  By the time I received it, all aromatics had evaporated off, yeilding an aromaless (and subsequently, flavorless) cup of medium-bodied hot water.<br /><br />Until Camano Island can come up with airtight packaging, it should be avoided.

review/text: I just received this and it is literally just coffee beans in a plastic lined paper bag with no seal. There is hardly any aroma and I can only imagine that it will taste just the same, flavourless, when I make a cup of coffee. This probably explains the really good deal on this product seeing as its 3 pounds for $23 through amazon warehouse deals. How often do you see organic coffee for that price? You should be ashamed of yourselves Amazon for selling such a poor product.

review/summary: Well Done--with one slight glitch
review/text: Tastes fine, cooks up well. Only improvement would be to fix what may be a machinery glitch that produces extra tiny pieces after cooking. Don't see them when I pour the uncooked pasta into the water, but once boiled it looks as if someone has sprinkled in some short lengths of vermicelli, which I guess are some end or side shavings of the corkscrew pasta. Tastes no different, but they are a little added inconvenience, because some can end up out of the colander, accumulating down at the bottom of the sink, etc. So if someone can just adjust the pasta cutter, extruder, or whatever it is called, or fix what is causing the problem, this one small glitch in an otherwise fine product will be solved.

review/summary: Great dog food. My pug is doing awesome.
review/text: I tried to feed my dog EVO red meat small bites because I wanted the best for him, but after a month it just had too much protein in it. He was gassy a lot and had soft stools. Sometimes even diarrhea. So I switched to this because Royal Canin also makes a special dog food for pugs. So in a couple of months when he's old enough I will switch him over to Pug 25. There are a couple of ingredients that I don't agree with like corn meal and beet pulp, the rest of the ingredients seem okay. After the switch to Royal Canin he is doing great. His stools firmed up and the gas was gone. He's happy and healthy and I'm happy with the food switch.

review/text: Contrary to popular belief, these are not just for baking. Not only are Oregon Blueberries loaded with antioxidants, they are delicious right out of the can.  I buy them in bulk from Amazon.Com. I add two or three tablespoons over my Total cereal every morning, along with a heaping spoonful of crushed, honey-roasted almonds and some Splenda. Float the heavenly mixture in skim milk or light soy milk. Add in a glass of orange juice and a banana and you're in for a treat.  Eating healthy can be fun.  This comes from one who was raised on a daily breakfast of bacon, saugage, eggs, whole milk, grits or hashbrowns and biscuits all dripping with homemade butter.  Granted, this was wonderful at the time, but it's a miracle that anyone survives past 50 on such a diet.  However, no health food is any good if you sit on your butt all day and do nothing.
