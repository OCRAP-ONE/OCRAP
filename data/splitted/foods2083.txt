review/summary: Beef Jerky Goes Bad?
review/text: What a rip off.  We opened the bag and a day later there was wispy white mold on it.  The whole bag had to be thrown out.  It even smelled a little "off".  You're better off buying it at the store.

review/summary: lost one bag of my "jack link's" beef jerky
review/text: I am a regular subscriber of this "Jack Link's" beef jerky terriyaki. This morning, I opened the new box from Amazon and found that there are only 9 bags in the box while it supposed to be 10. I used to trust Amazon and this is the first time that I check the quantity in the box. Since the inside box is open, so someone might have taken one during the packing process because s/he loves it so much but I hate to lose one bag of my Jack Links beef jerky!!

review/summary: Great snack....even during battle!!
review/text: I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Amazon). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it.<br />For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product.<br />If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it!

review/summary: bad beef
review/text: I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you.

review/summary: Cheaper at Walmart
review/text: Good stuff....but.  I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag).  I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Amazon (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors.  I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there.  (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.  I will give kudos to Amazon for their customer service policies, though.  I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free.

review/summary: Delicious jerky
review/text: This is probably the best mass-produced beef jerky on the market.  It isn't too tough or dry like cheaper brands, isn't too sweet or spicy either.  Only problem is that as a snack I feel it isn't overly healthy.  (It has MSG, sodium nitrite and a lot of sodium).  However it is a low-fat, high-protein food, and very tasty.

review/summary: Great
review/text: I bought this flavor for the first time at the store, when they were out of my favorite (Sweet N Hot). My kids (ages 4 and 2) were begging me for some when we got back to the car. I told them they could try it, but that it would be spicy. They agreed, took the small bites I gave them and continued to ask for more until the entire package was gone! The flavor is exactly as the title describes. It's sweet and spicy, and reminds me of a dish I would order at a Thai restaurant. It's not as Spicy as the Sweet N Hot, but it still has quite a kick. It's not my favorite flavor, but I still give it 5 stars for the great texture and good flavor (and the fact that my kids devoured it). I bought this package with my kids in mind. I am all for natural products that they enjoy!

I first had a good experience and what seemed like a quality jerky and continued to keep it ordered on my subscribe and save account. The next 2 bags were awful. There were tiny bits and they were extra hard and grisly. I thought maybe it was just a bad run and let the next order come through. They were terrible also. It was like there was one or two decent strips of meat, and the rest was inedible. I'm not sure how this keeps happening. I had meant to cancel this subscription but remembered after I was shipped another pack of two. Maybe they'll be better but I haven't been eager to to open them. Roll of the dice, I guess.

review/text: I love this beef jerky and so I looked everywhere for it, and had trouble finding it readily. So when I found this product on subscription on Amazon, I was more than thrilled to subscribe. That was two months ago. I've now cancelled my subscription. Why you ask? The unopened packages of the beef jerky were hard as a rock and were tasteless as a result. I don't know what Amazon does to receive the jerkys so cheap thereby giving the customers the 15% discount, but I'd rather pay more and get them off retail and enjoy every piece.. I am very disappointed at the result and won't re-subscribe again.

It says on the package the jerky will be good until 2013. I guess the company is wrong.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon CS. After 5 minute they decides to give me refund. This is probably all that Amazon can do, but I will not buy any kind of food/snacks on Amazon anymore. And I will not buy any Jack Links product on line or in store. Their quality control is really doubtable.<br /><br />MOLD ON JERKY!! Be aware!

review/summary: Best ever
review/text: I buy a lot of stuff online and only write a review if something was very good or very bad.<br /><br />I honestly have to say that Jack Link's Jerky is the best jerky I have ever eaten (I've even bought some from a meat market before).  I have tried several of their flavors and all have been good.  The Sweet & Hot could be a little hotter, IMO, but it is still awesome and my favorite of theirs.  Besides the different flavors being good, what really sets Jack Link's apart from every other jerky I've tried is the quality of the meat itself.  The meat has the perfect amount of moisture, making it able to actually bite a piece in half without having to gnaw on it for 20 minutes.  While other brands aren't very consistent, particularly Pemmican, which I used to think was the best available, Jack Link's is very consistent with the quality of each piece.  Most brands usually have a mix of perfect pieces, dry pieces, and way too thick pieces.  Not Jack Link's, I've yet to get a dry piece, or one that was way too thick.<br /><br />The several people that I have "turned on to" Jack Link's would fully agree with me about this review.  We've actually spoke about how amazed we are with it.<br /><br />Walmart is the place that I first found it, and they are always out of stock of it.  So I turned to Amazon and was able to find it for roughly the same price when you factor in shipping.<br /><br />BTW, the package of ten 1.5 ounce bags is nice if you are like me and tend to just keep eating until it is gone.  :)  Also, each 1.5 ounce bag has about 25 grams of protein.  So if you are on a workout program, it makes a nice way to get extra 25 grams of protein with very little fat into your diet.

review/summary: By Far The Best Jack Links!
review/text: I love beef jerky, its perfect for work, packs tons of protein, easy to eat and store.  I have to say though the price of the stuff locally is insane, the 3oz bags go for up to 7 bucks a piece.<br /><br />This is the best deal I've found by far, select delivery 1 time a month for 16 bucks and sit back and wait for your jerky!<br /><br />Now on to the flavor, I usually buy the peppered Jack Links for the touch of spice.  Recently I found the A1 steak jerky, and its fantastic!  It seems like its more dry, like the homemade jerky I remember from my grandparents.  I find the most of the flavors to be to moist, and salty.<br /><br />If your a fan of jerky, and the taste of A1 sauce, you will enjoy this product, use amazons subscription option and save another 15%, excellent deal when compared to store purchasing.

It came in a 2-pack, and the 2nd pack looks fine but has the same date stamp on it, so I'm not sure I dare eat it.  They expire in December of 2013...14 months away.  I'm not sure what happened to it, just that I wasted $10, and I'm still nauseous just thinking about the sight and smell of it.  Is jerky even supposed to spoil at all?

They must have  shipped just in time for the outgoing flight from Miami to El Salvador.<br /><br />Of course the beef jerky is delicious.  I don't understand why there are beef jerkies in this damn country.

review/summary: Perfect Protein
review/text: I am on a high protein, low calorie diet.  Jerky is perfect because it has 15gm of protein per serving and only 80 calories.  It is immensely portable and doesn't have to be refrigerated, so I take it with me everywhere.  It is a lifesaver.  I have it on subscribe n save so I always have it available at a price much more reasonable than at the grocery stores. And I love the taste!

review/summary: Taste good but not quite Thai Spicy
review/text: I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links.

review/summary: Pretty Damn Good Jerky
review/text: I've been trying different jerkys because my Dukan Diet allows it... Some have way too much sugar content. Thanks, Jack Links, for doing it up right! (3 grams sugar compared to 7+ in other brands.) The peppered flavor is spicy enough to let me know I ate something, but it's not so sweet it comes across like candy. I buy pound bags and divide it into five baggies, or I'd eat the whole bag at once. The meat is pretty clean, compared to other jerky I've had where every other mouthful is unfit for chewing. Best price I've found was through eBay buying in quantity, then dividing the bags myself. That last crumbly handful left in the bottom of the one pound bag is a real eye-opener, as that seems to be where all the pepper seeds congregate. Good Times! P.S. Lost 40 pounds on Dukan Diet in about three months and am very content with the foods I get to eat, jerky being one of them.

review/text: Love Jack Links, so I was thrilled to see these easy to grab individually wrapped packages on Amazon with the Subscribe and Save option.  I have a son in college so I have them sent to him. It is pricier than going to a warehouse store and buying in bulk but you are paying for the convenience of the 100 calorie packs.  I have them in my pantry at home also, and my 2 adult daughters use them for their lunches also. I would have given 5 stars if the price was a bit lower.

review/summary: The Best of Jack Links brands in the 'hot factor category'
review/text: The Peppered brand is my favorite of the 'hot' options from Jack Links beef jerky.  It is on the pricey side, but I subscribe to it anyways currently.  I've tried the Jalepeno brand but, it is not as 'hot' as the Peppered brand -but I still make room for both.<br /><br />Again back to the price... it's on the high side.  Which compels me to eventually research more about making my own beef jerky and then make it closer to what I'm looking for - scorching hot!  Something that includes cayenne, habaneros and the like for a taste to remember!

review/text: I know its not the healthiest snack, but there's nothing as satisfying as a nice quality piece of jerky.  It keeps the hunger away longer than all the various candy, chips and other carb snacks.<br /><br />I have order this double package in both Original and Teriyaki, and is the best price I have found when you figure it down to a per oz price.  It's even cheaper if you add it as a "subscription" to be shipped every 1, 2, 3, or 6 months...which you can cancel at any time.<br /><br />One other use I have for this is an extra special treat for my dog.<br /><br />Anyway, this is always high quality jerky.  Only negative is these large backs end up with a bunch of small crumbled shavings in the bottom--guess what then gets poured onto a plate for my dog!!!

The small bags are nice for day trips, but it would nice to be able to buy in larger bags for additional discounts.

review/text: I live in China, and I am unable to find anything made by Jack Link's here. I am able to buy different beef jerky products here, but they just don't taste the same. Fortunately my mother-in-law and wife gift me with Jack Link's beef jerky on a regular basis. Jack Link's uses premium cuts of meat that are seasoned and smoked in a way that you will find to be delicious. Once you open the bag, be sure to put it in the fridge unless you want your beef jerky to grow some white fuzz. An opened bag of beef jerky that is refrigerated can last for months. I also recommend Jack Link's teriyaki, peppered, sweet & hot, hickory smoked, and steakhouse recipes.

Some of them are pretty good (especially Golden Valley products) but overall none are better than Jack Links. Reliably you get tender, tasty and fresh jerky. I like their original flavor the best. It's not too salty, too sweet, or too hard. It's 'just right' in my opinion.

This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.  I wanted sweet and HOT beef jerky.  3 stars because at least it is edible.  But it will probably be a gift to my friend, with a BIG disclaimer about the HOT.

review/summary: Cheaper else where
review/text: I had ordered 3 packages of these back in June.  No problems! ! !<br />Now all of a sudden, they went from less than $12 a package to almost $18 a package.  A bit too steep of an increase for my blood.  I stopped by Wally world earlier on the weekend and they still have them for about half price.  So I grabbed a case for what they want for three envelopes.<br />Guess if your hardup and no way to get to town, go for it - however, if your looking to save a buck and heading out to wally world, wait for it!

review/text: My grandson is a beef jerky addict. We don't have much to choose from here so I ordered this. He absolutely loves it!!! He says it's not hard and has such a good taste. It's not too hot which would okay with him if it was.  He'd like more but he eats it so fast that it's going to be a sometime treat for him. The first day he ate 3 bags.

review/summary: Best mass marketed dried meat product ON EARTH
review/text: I'm normally rather "meh" about beef jerky and similar products (e.g. slim jims and their ilk), but Jack Links are always good, and the sweet and hot variety, for whatever reason, is AMAZING.  So many other varieties of beef jerky are like dry, stale wood chips that you can break your teeth on.  These have an incredible texture, with many huge cuts of meat that are still tender and moist in the center.  They still have the jaw workout that sort of defines beef jerky, but unlike so many other brands they're still recognizable as meat, and good meat at that.  The flavor is much as advertised, which may be a bit too spicy for some, but I love it.  It's heat that very slowly builds, so if you ate a couple of pieces you might not feel it, but after downing a full package you'll be reaching for a vanilla frappe.  The unfortunate thing is that they're hard to find where I live (Cape Cod/Rhode Island), the only place that routinely stocks is Cumberland Farms, and sad to say they seem to have been disappearing even from there.  It will be a real shame if they're discontinued, as in a mass produced snack world full of mediocre, predictable, unsatisfying fodder, Jack Links sweet and hot is the sort of thing you can make a satisfying meal of.

review/summary: Hidden Ingredients - disappointing
review/text: Amy's always has delicious organic and vegetarian food options, which is a wonderful thing, but unfortunately on some of their products they choose to hide ingredients. Amy's Southwestern chili is one of these items - it apparently contains "spices," but Amy's does not respect consumers enough to reveal exactly what those spices are. If you tell Amy's customer service what you cannot have, they will tell you if that particular ingredient is in the mix, but the problem with this of course is that many people have multiple food sensitivities, with varying responses (for instance, the same person may go into anaphylaxis from nuts, get slight hives from citrus, and get the shakes from caffeine or chocolate), and they need to know exactly what is in the food they eat so that if and when they do have an allergic reaction they can figure out what specific ingredient was the culprit and avoid it in the future. If you invite a friend with allergies over to your house and they ask what you put in their food, who in their right mind would make that person play a guessing game to figure out whether they will be poisoned by the food or not?<br /><br />It's a matter of respect, and on this count Amy's has fallen flat on its face. I urge you to avoid all of Amy's products that list vague ingredients, like "spices" or "natural flavors." Hopefully they will eventually get the hint.

review/summary: My Favorite Chili
review/text: I discovered this chili about a year ago and I've become addicted to it. I have it at least once every two weeks. I usually split it into two servings and serve with sour cream, shredded cheese, and tortilla chips and eat it almost like a dip. I'm on the subscription plan for this!<br /><br />If you like beans, you'll love this chili. Plus, it has very little heat to the taste (even though it says "Medium"), but will open up your sinuses if you have allergies or a cold that has you stuffed up.

review/summary: Hard to recover a meal from this canned product
review/text: I'm usually a fan of Amy's Organics - they provide a reliable gluten-free product that I can easily adapt to my needs. In my kitchen, canned foods are never an end product, but a stepping stone toward a lovingly crafted meal. However, in this case, the can might be beyond my skills of adaptation.<br /><br />CUMIN. Did we have a cumin spill in Amyland? My dear sweet unnamable gods in heaven! One bite of this chili has the most cumin I've ever had in one bite, probably in one meal, maybe one lifetime. This is the cuminiest of cuminy chilis; all other flavors cower in dread of the sheer cumininess of Amy's Organic Southwestern Black Bean Chili.<br /><br />CUMIIIIIIIIIN.<br /><br />It might have beans: I don't know; they could be giant lumps of cumin, for all I can tell. It's probably free of pesticides: However, my kitchen's organic-produce-borne fruitflies are afraid to near my bowl of this; if it hasn't got pesticides, it's certainly an effective pest repellant, and I'm considering rubbing it all over my chili starved body before I go out to the mosquito clouded Weber to grill up some real food. It's touted as vegan, which isn't really a selling point for me: After the first taste of this chili has passed my tongue, the remainder of the can will never brave the touch of flesh again.<br /><br />Back to the kitchen, Amy. Check the smudged details of your recipe real close. Try a milliliter (mL) instead of a barrel (BBL), and I'll try this one again.

review/summary: Not What You Might Expect in Terms of "Quick Cooking"
review/text: At its weight, the huge bag of Nishiki Quick Cooking Brown Rice (10 pounds) isn't worth the hassle of returning. No way does this have a retail value of more than $60, by the way, but I bought it for just over $20, because I thought I could make brown and white seasoned rice blends whereby the rice would cook in the same amount of time. Brown rice takes much longer to steam or cook up than long grain white rice, and my family isn't fond of the flavor of brown rice by itself. I can get regular brown rice for much less cost at the grocery store than this package from Amazon, and when it arrived (very quickly - 5 stars for delivery) I read the package to discover the rice must be soaked for 20 minutes in water before cooking for an additional 25 minutes! Yikes! Nothing quick about a 45 minute process for rice. While I hadn't expected Minute Rice, I did expect a label stating "Quick Cooking" meant it actually cooks up quickly.<br /><br />For those who might not have cooked plain, brown rice, it steams or cooks up in the same 45 minutes or less that this "Quick Cooking" rice requires. I didn't even open the bag and will pass it on to someone who cooks brown rice on a regular basis. IF YOU LIKE BROWN RICE and you don't have many local grocery stores, it might be worth buying from Amazon, but don't expect this brand/type to save time in the kitchen.

So basically, this is a butter biscuit (cookies) that is not too hard or soft, nor is it too sweet or lacking in flavour in it's own right; that is then covered in some of the best chocolate I've ever eaten (and I've eaten plenty ;} ). The chocolate is sweet, creamy, melt-in-your-mouth perfect. Sure, this bar is criticized for it's calorie content - but every now and then you've gotta live!

As I'm sure most people agree they can eat this in one sitting much like any other candy bar out there and maybe most can it eat more than once a day.  What's deceptive is the nutrition for it!  What should be one serving is considered THREE servings.  Each serving is 200 calories and 15g of fat.  That means the whole package is 600 calories and 45g of fat!  An average build person should only eat 60g of fat a day!  So the amazingly great taste comes at a massive price and it's not worth it.

That's like trying to  buy a book without knowing the author, or a computer without knowing how much RAM, hard disk space, or video memory it has.<br /><br />Yes, sometimes that nutritional information is wrong. WE GET IT. So put on your warning, and move on. Pulling the information because some twits out there are, apparently, outfitting their Himalayan mountain expeditions based solely on the nutritional data you list, and then, I suppose, eating some of their porters when your calorie counts are off, isn't fair to the everyday Joes who just want something to munch on.<br /><br />For the rest of us, we'd just like to have some small inkling of what food is in the food we're about to buy. Pretty please. Because shopping from Amazon shouldn't mean I have to spend half my time Googling each product to find out what the heck it actually is.

review/summary: Nutritious and Delicious
review/text: Since becoming a diabetic, I have studied foods in an attempt to better control my blood sugar.  Some foods (like ones with lots of sugar) spike my blood sugar.  If a meal is not carefully balanced my blood sugar and my energy drops too much.  So, I am always looking for healthy foods, especially snack foods.  What I usually find are great tasting snacks that are too high in sugar, low in protein, and low in fiber. They are good for normal people, camping or taking long hikes, but not for my daily health snacks.<br /><br />ExtendBar Mixed Berry Delight meets my requirements. This snack has 12 g of protein, 0 sugar (4 g of "sugar alcohol"), and 0 cholesterol. "ExtendBar's" 20 g of carbohydrates is uncooked cornstarch, which is designed to be slowly processed in digestion.<br /><br />Reviews written in 2007 and 2008 mentioned that the taste was unpleasant and the color of the bar was pink.  They must have improved the product because, to me, the taste is pleasant, one of the best snack bars I have ever eaten, and the color is now an off white.  It is not sweet, nor tart. It reminds me of a mix of strawberries and blueberries. The bar's taste is almost as good as the actual strawberries and blueberries I eat regularly.  As with all snacks, I  always consume it with a fluid which helps avoid any dryness.<br /><br />The Extendbar Mixed Berry Delight is valuable. This is one of the best items for overall health that I have seen on the market. It is low in sodium and sugar (no high fructose corn syrup), and gluten free. On the other hand, high in protein (12g), good fiber (6 g), and sustained energy level. All this good nutrition and only 150 calories. .<br /><br />The advertised sustained energy level is real. I have tried this for awhile without blood sugar spikes and without low blood sugar (amazing how they do it, but they do). I highly recommend this product.

review/text: We received this order in just a few days as promised.  We, my husband and I, like these bars because they keep our blood sugar even as advertised.  We are very satisfied with this product.
