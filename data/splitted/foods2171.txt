review/summary: A GOOD WAY TO AVOID CAFFEINE?
review/text: For some people, excessive coffee consumption can pose health problems or it might just make it hard to sleep at night or give them the jitters. ENTER "Postum Caffeine Free Original, Instant Hot Beverage", which has been around since the end of the 19th century.<br /><br />With Postum, the usual mistake is simply to start drinking it in place of coffee. The sharp contrast in taste and lack of caffeine often makes this a solution doomed to failure. A better method is to add some Postum to your coffee or to have the "Postum" at night if you can take the caffeine during the day and simply let your body tell you how much caffeine you are okay about replacing in this manner.<br /><br />Of course, you could apply the same approach with decaffeinated coffee, so it is a matter of taste. By itself, however, I find "Postum" very bland and unsatisfying. Nevertheless, I attempt to replace some of my coffee consumption in this manner every five years or so.

review/summary: I'm an Official Addict
review/text: Let me  begin by saying, I am not particularly adventurous in the candy aisle. I don't pick sweets up to try on a whim, because, let's face it - whether or not I like it, it's probably been sitting either in a box or on a shelf since the Stone Age. But when my roommate bought some at the 99 Cent Store (yes, we poor people do shop there) and offered me one, I took a bite to be polite, and ended up eating the entire thing and a second one to boot.<br /><br />These sesame bars are crunchy, sweet, and full of delicious sesame flavor. As someone who likes to catch and eat all the runaway toasted sesame seeds from her bagel, I could not get enough of these. The next time I passed the store, I ran in and used pocket change to buy six more, and have been stashing them like a squirrel.<br /><br />I'm a little disappointed at the cost of this product (really? a pack of 36 is $27?) but maybe I'm just being silly and am disappointed I can't stock more for my twice weekly indulgence without going all the way to the store. Phooey.

review/text: This is a far healthier alternative to Rice Crispies. Organic and without sugar! To boost the flavor add some soy milk (Edensoy is the best brand) or rice milk (Rice Dream is the king). Cow milk kills the delicate flavor of whole grains and is the reason why commercial cereal manufacturers add so much suggar to their products.

I kept taking more and more out of the bag and snapping them in half and they were all full if hair. Thick black whisker like hair, thin white hair, even orange hair (I've certainly never seen an orange lamb). I called my local pet store about the discusting product, they were nice enough to refund me my $12.00 for the hairy cookies and pulled all the products from their shelf. I emailed a complaint letter to the company and as well placed a phone call. I never heard back from my email and the lady I spoke with on the phone basically told me it was ok that the cookies were full of hair. I will never buy any of their products ever again.

review/summary: Best Turkey Ever
review/text: Never had a brined turkey before, decided to try this product based on being on sale at Amazon and the Apple Sage appeal.  Only had a 12 pound turkey so I only used half of the product.  Didn't add the sugar or apple cider the box recipe included, instead opted for just filtered water so as not to add calories.  Turkey set overnight in the brine, (about 12 hours total), prepared the turkey on a smoker.  Couldn't believe the flavor and moistness of the turkey, incredible.  I'll be trying other fire and flavor brines for pork also.  As a cautionary note, given that most store bought frozen turkeys are injected with a somewhat salty liquid I'm glad I only used half of the box.  The turkey was seasoned perfectly, any more salt would have been excessive.

review/text: I'm new to baking with bean flours, but I decided to purchase this flour because I read that it has a mild flavor after baking and it's great for gluten free baking. I'm an avid baker, and using Garfava flour makes my yeast breads turn out great, just like a wheat bread. The protein in this flour helps with the texture of gluten free breads. I like to couple this flour with a sweeter flour like millet, corn, or sorghum for even better flavor, but this flour is great for all your baking needs. High quality and fresh.

review/summary: New Braunfels Smokehouse Sweet Fire Pickles
review/text: I went through New Braunfels not long ago, and I bought a jar of New Braunfels Smokehouse's Sweet Fire Pickles. All I can say is they are nothing short of amazing. Spicy and sweet, they are the perfect accompaniment for a barbecue, as a condiment in place of a relish, all by themselves - I think it's a surprisingly versatile food. Imagine candied jalapenos and bread-and-butter pickles together, and that's like what we have in this jar. If you're averse to spicy, this probably isn't for you - it's spicy. But the sweetness brings in an additional dimension, an added richness, and I always find myself wanting to have another taste. The sweetness doesn't diminish the spiciness, nor does the spiciness diminish the sweetness; but they both work together to make for a really robust combination of sensations and flavors. I can't help but think that a little bit of this on top of some cream cheese on a cracker would be all the better... the spiciness and sweetness of these pickles, the creaminess of the cream cheese, and the saltiness of the cracker would make for a real treat. Hmmmm... All we'd really need to add is a little bit of New Braunfels Smokehouse's bacon or maybe sausage or ham.<br /><br />Quite simply, this is my favorite pickle. And I'm almost all out of them...

review/summary: Generic chicken breasts
review/text: Nothing makes these chicken breasts special whatsoever. They are standard generic tasting chicken breasts, tiny ones at that. They are tender and juicy when grilled, I will say that...but you'll be through eating one in less than 2 minutes. There's no difference between Omahas chicken breasts and regular chicken breasts I can buy in any grocery store Save a lot/Aldi included....for well over 1/2 the price of what they charge for these and for nearly quadruple the amount. So, why charge so much for these? I can get behind their steaks, even though they're overpriced too, and a few other Omaha products like the hot dogs and stuffed baked potatoes, but can't really get behind these chicken breasts. It's not like these are organic chicken breasts that have a decent size to them, which is what the price Omaha charges for them would suggest. These are as generic as generic gets. Would of been fine if 1 of their chicken breasts was the size of 2 of their chicken breasts. Instead it's like they got 1 large chicken breast and cut it it up to make 4 out of it. Luckily, I received these in a comped sampler. There's no reason whatsoever for anyone to buy just these chicken breasts through Omaha Steaks as Omaha gives you no reason to. Omaha really needs to make their portions bigger. People would be fine paying their prices if the portions were bigger...but half the things they sell the price to size ratio leaves you feeling ripped off. Not that I paid for these as like I said they were comped, but if I did no doubt I'd feel pretty ripped off. Change your mentality Omaha. Instead of less is more, think MORE is MORE. Get with the times.

review/text: This coffee is for people like me who like a light-roasted (therefore presumably high caffeine), mild, smooth coffee. Those who like dark roasts propabably will not like this because a light flavor accompanies a light roast.<br /><br />Related issue for those who are concerned with "Fair Trade": I misread the extensive writeup of this coffee and so I did not notice that the words "Fair Trade" are neither in the description nor on the package. So, if that is the case, then it might be that this coffee is great for reducing the carbon footprint, but might not conform to fair trading standards for the peasant growers.

I did not mix it with any regular coffee whatsoever, but instead decided to just try a cup of the product alone.  I must say, it is very DELICIOUS.  I am looking forward to trying some of the other flavors.  What I like even more about it, is that it is made with herbs and nuts; you can hardly go wrong with that!

If you really have to have a sweetener of some kind, try a hazelnut creamer, as it helps make it palatable to those who need a little sweet with their coffee.

review/summary: Good stuff as coffee replacement
review/text: I have tried Teeccino Hazelnut and , while it does not taste much like coffee, it is a great morning hot beverage. I use 2 tablespoons and make on mug of the brew and use some maple syrup sweetner. Yum.<br />Many develop allergy to coffee and not just to caffeine but to some of the 300 other compounds in regular coffee. Beware of this.

review/text: While it didn't taste like hazelnut at all to me, I like this product. I just mixed it in with the regular unflavored. I find that I use a little over half the recommended amount per cup, and it suits me fine.

review/summary: Don't buy this product
review/text: I read the good reviews on Teeccino java herbal coffee so I went to my local Whole Foods to purchase it.  They only had Teeccino original light roast herbal coffee.  I thought I'd try it anyway.  I wasn't expecting it to taste like coffee.  I was just looking for a hot beverage without caffeine, that tasted good.  I can't find the words to describe the awful flavor.  I made my daughter try it too to help describe the flavor.  She said "it smells like plastic".  I wasted my money buying this product!!

review/summary: perfect for lunchboxes!
review/text: I have a 6yo in 1st grade. I introduced these to her by telling her it was like "applesauce in a Capr* S*n pouch" :) She was convinced to try it and now she requests them in her lunchbox on school days. That makes me a very happy mommy to know that she is getting omega 3s, protein, vitamins, and antioxidants in a yummy applesauce-like "snack." She is a fan of the other flavors, too. Sometimes if we are in a hurry I give her a pouch for breakfast on the go. If your child is used to sugary applesauces the flavor of this might take some getting used to, but it's worth it because these are so much healthier. I'm glad Amazon has them in these 16-packs because we go thru them fast! :)

review/summary: Not that good
review/text: I purchased these for my 18 month old son because he loves the other pouches that happybaby makes and I thought he would like these too. He will eat almost anything but he would not eat these. The other pouches they make have a screw on lid and a plastic spout and he can eat those all by himself with out making a mess. The first time he tried one of the Super Cinnamon ones it got everywhere and he only got half way through it before he refused to eat anymore. He wouldn't even try it the second time I offered it to him which made me curious so I tasted it. It tasted like cinnamon barf. I will have to throwaway the rest of the two boxes. I guess we will just stick with the Happy tot pouches like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VJ70K">HAPPYBABY Happy Tot - Stage 4: Green Beans, Pears and Peas, 4.22  Ounce Pouch (Pack of 16)</a> which I can not say enough good things about.

review/summary: Happymorning Super Cinnamon
review/text: Baby loves this flavor, however, my baby (and I would assume most) would have issues with this one... My 15 month old has been sleeping through the night perfect for months now, until I started feeding her this(1 pouch a day) every other day or so. I'd give her the super banana flavor on other days. All of a sudden she started waking up during the night, multiple times, crying and just a plain wreck. After a couple nights like this my wife mentioned how the baby seemed to have a lot of gas lately. A few days more of this I was going crazy. I started looking at all the things we changed recently and came back to the happymorning foods I just recently bought. Started looking at the ingredients and nothing appeared out of the normal for the super banana flavor. Started looking this one over (super cinnamon) and the 2nd ingredient is PRUNES! My baby doesn't handle prunes well and she has been going through a very tough time lately because of this food. I stopped feeding her this flavor and all went back to normal. So again, just a warning for all.

review/summary: Great product - poor packaging
review/text: We have bought Earth's Best organic baby food in a department store previously. After discovering our baby liked it, we went to amazon to compare prices and larger quantities.<br /><br />The baby food is great, no complaints at all. The packaging was sub par. The first thing we noticed was the exterior box wasnt taped or sealed ( It was a clamshell type box that folds over and you insert part of the box back into itself - anyone could have opened the package and closed it again). The jars are shrink wrapped with a cardboard base. The exterior packaging appears undamaged.<br /><br />Inside there were broken jars of food - and grocery items are not returnable. We have contacted Amazon's customer service and am waiting a response.

review/summary: Great Price for Quality food for baby
review/text: When I was pregnant I was sure I'd be one of those Moms who has both the time and inclination to make all her own baby food. And I did go that route for a while, until I realized how much money I was spending and how much food (once made) I was having to throw out. A friend had suggested Amazon Moms to me and we had already started getting our diapers via 'subscribe and save'. I decided to try this food and she loves it, I get other varieties than just the fruit and veggies, but my daughter enjoys all of them. I have even tasted most of them myself and they are fairly tasty.<br />Plus the company is a heavy contributor to Sesame Street...so when you buy their products, you are helping out PBS as well. Win Win.

We'd been purchasing them in the stores for over $1 a jar so this is a huge bargain for us.  As for those who say your baby doesn't need organic foods, yes it's true that a baby has a liver, but why tax it any more than it already will be through the years?

review/summary: Good sampler at an economical price
review/text: Our family (especially our nine-month-old daughter) is a fan of Earth's Best fruits and vegetables.  Having sampled a bit of each food in this sampler pack, I think it's worth noting that this brand tastes like the actual foods listed on the label, which cannot be said of some other brands we've tried, although they may be cheaper (the old adage is true - you really do get what you pay for sometimes).  In addition to the quality, this sampler offers a great variety of the fruits and vegetables, meaning you aren't stuck with a large quantity of any one item that baby might decide he or she doesn't like.  (And as parents, we've learned that baby can be exceptionally fickle.)  Although admittedly each child will have his or her own preferences, our daughter has enjoyed each of the fruit and vegetable types in this pack.  I would also highly recommend taking advantage of the Amazon subscribe & save pricing, as it makes the price much more economical than you'll likely find in a store (subscribe & save = approx. $0.81/jar, while stores in our area price the same size of jar at approx. $1 each).

review/summary: Bad batch
review/text: I have ordered the Maple Almond Butter multiple times, and two times, I received a bad batch.  The first time (jars), Amazon (excellent customer service) refunded my money.  The second time (squeeze packs) I decided to contact Justin's directly via Facebook.  Justin's told me that a batch of plain almond butter had been packaged as maple almond butter and that I should send "Todd" an email and they would replace it.  I sent the email, but never got a response.  When you get a good batch, it is wonderful, but for this amount of money, I'd expect the quality control to be a lot better.  I think they may be growing too quickly and they can't maintain the quality with the faster pace of sales.  It's very disappointing because I like the product when I get a good, properly labeled batch.

The only reason I only gave it 4 stars versus 5 was because it takes a whole lot of kneading of the packet to get it all out.  There are many times that I knead and knead the packet and still can't get the whole thing softened up.  All in all, I do like it though!  And the fact that it's portion controlled is a real plus!

I went on a limb with this one and so glad that I did.  Such a rich flavor and you cant even taste the maple at all, there is just some sweet to it, but it is not a maple sweet at all.  So if you expect to taste maple, you wont be overwhelmed at all, cant even tell but it does add something that I have not been able to detect.  YUM YUM YUM, you wont regret buying this and love the individual sized packets, makes for portion control so you know how much you are getting and just the right amount.  Can take anywhere with you and I like to eat it just out of a pack.  You wont regret getting this product.

review/text: First, Justin's is the best almond butter ever. It's a joy to eat on anything.<br /><br />I wanted something for snacks/meals at work, and these are perfect. First you never need to worry about the oil separating out in the jar, since you squish each packet to combine before opening. Next you don't need a knife - the corner of the packet tears open easily and you can just squeeze it on to what ever you'd like. And if you only open one, it's automatic portion control.<br /><br />Last but not least, they make great mini-gifts for coworkers who've given you that coffee packet when you really needed it, or that paper plate when your lunch was leaking. Even better, you may get someone else hooked so you can split the order next time.

review/summary: Almondy goodness but where's the maple?
review/text: Usually I buy a tub of freshly ground, unsweetened, unsalted almond butter from the health food store. But when I need almond butter on-the-go, these single serve packs are great. As a diabetic, I love to spread it on wasa crackers for a healthy snack. Justin's maple almond butter is delicious, bursting with the taste of freshly roasted almonds. However, I detect no maple whatsoever. Almond is a strong flavor, so whatever maple is in there is overshadowed by it. Nonetheless, it is yummy. Hope they expand to include a crunchy version. This would get a 5 star rating from me if it had more of a maple flavor and a tad less salt. It tastes a bit too salty for me, but then I tend to eat unsalted nut butters.

review/summary: YUMMIEST WITH MANUKA HONEY!
review/text: I can't imagine anything being not good that involves maple. This just proves that to be true. The packets are fine to carry, but I finally discovered that there are indeed larger JARS with a lot more 'stuff' than in the packets for the money...also on a subscribe-and-save deal. NOW...if you would like this to be sweet(er) because it truly is not what I would call sweet, I would suggest that you might want to buy some of the Airborne Manuka and Wildflower Honey that is offered on Amazon. I left a review for that product as well. Combining two heaping spoonfuls of the manuka honey <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5IM8G">New Zealand Manuka with Wildflower Blend Honey 500g / 18oz</a> with the organic maple almond butter and mixing well forms these two great products into something that is ridiculously (sinfully even) good! I like this mix with whole grain bread. It's a minor miracle to find a combination of super healthy (and organic) things that are this good.<br />  I've been eating this honey for years and am delighted to find the protein-packed organic maple almond butter to go with it. Thanks, Amazon, for offering great organic foods that are still affordable!

review/summary: Different and Delicious
review/text: Before this I have never had any nut butter besides peanut butter. This is a whole different experience! This Maple Almond Butter has a slightly heartier texture to it with a naturally sweet taste. In addition, the squeeze packs are perfect, providing a perfect serving to put in a sandwich, or a nice little snack to grab on the way out the door. Two thumbs up!!

review/summary: Gluten Free & Delicious
review/text: If you're gluten intolerant like I am, these little packets of deliciousness are the answer to eating outside the home kitchen, when restaurant food seems just too 'iffy'.<br /><br />The taste is wonderful! I've tried the plain, the maple, and the chocolate, and the ease of carrying and eating them can't be beat!<br /><br />I carry a Justin's packet and gluten free crackers with me when we travel, and now I don't have to worry about being 'glutenized' when the waiter at the restaurant has clearly never ever heard the word 'gluten' before in his life, and the plain hamburger that I ordered (after I explained gluten to the waiter) comes on a big seedy bun - and all this when I've ordered from the "Gluten Free Menu" !!!!!!!!<br /><br />So - Thank You to Justin's Nut Butters  - I'll be ordering more of these ... YUM!YUM!

review/summary: Try it once and you're hooked!
review/text: A friend of mine in Boulder told me about delicious Justin's nut butters were, so I ordered some online. I was planning on just buying peanut butter, but when I saw that they had almond butter (which quite frankly I didn't know existed beforehand), I decided to try it out. Good bye peanut butter, almond butter is all I eat now. The honey almond butter is very good, but the maple almond butter is incredible. The squeeze packs are great for bringing along on-the-go. Can't wait for ski season - I'll be packing my jacket full of squeeze packs!

review/summary: Great snacks for anywhere, anytime!
review/text: I've always loved almonds, but this is just so convenient for on-the-go snacking. Not only can I eat it while I'm hiking or camping, but it's also great for anywhere where I don't have to carry around a knife and jar (which is most places :) ).<br />The taste is wonderful; one thing I've always disliked about nut butters was that they contained too much sugar. Justin's Almond butter has has only 4g of sugar, but it still tastes very sweet without going overboard. The palm fruit oil they use is also way more healthy than the palm kernel oil that most food products use, so that's great. I can put it on anything (like fruits) and it'll taste great, but I love putting it on bagels the most!<br />Once you try this, you will NOT want to go back to any other types of almond nut butters!

review/text: I love all the Justin Nut Butters and this one and the peanut butter with honey are my favorites at the moment.  No waste, no mess, always fresh.<br /><br />This is such a brilliant idea, to have perfect portions in individual packets.  I have to watch every calorie and this keeps me from overdoing it.  The Maple Almond has a rich almond flavor with a not-overpowering but luscious hint of maple.  Your local health food grocery store probably has some Justin's packets.  Try a few and find your favorites.  I think then you'll be making sure you don't run out!  The jars are more economical but only if you really can keep yourself from overdoing it!  I think Justin's packets are the best healthy treats around.

review/text: Thank goodness for portion packets! One taste and you won't be able to put it down. I squeeze every last bit out of every packet. Almond butter is okay....but the not too sweet slight maple flavor of the maple almond butter is sublime. You will not be disappointed.<br />I start most mornings with half a banana and half of a packet of almond butter before heading to the gym. It is a satisfying hold over until I come home from working out.

The cookies are delicious and look great, and  Beautiful Sweets has a whole variety of themes for year-round occasions.<br />One very minor issue, I wish the product page had specific information about shipping times. It took Beautiful Sweets about a week to ship my order; there's nothing wrong with that, but it would just be nice to know, especially when you're used to Amazon shipping everything so quickly.<br />On the positive side, they emailed with tracking number as soon as the package shipped.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering more from Beautiful Sweets in the future. Sister In Law doesn't know it yet, but she's getting the Halloween special!

Now strawberry-fidelity aside, these bonbons are still pretty good.

review/summary: Good For Cooking - Extremely Salty & Very Firm
review/text: I had never cared much for green olives, that is until I went to Spain, and had Spanish olives. Wow! I did a 180 with their rich, delicious flavor, so I only buy green olives from Spain (and olive oil too!).<br /><br />I was looking forward to trying these, but sadly, I found them to be extremely salty - and not as flavorful as others I've had.They would be good for tapenade, as the previous reviewer stated, or in a pasta sauce, or any "dish", as they will add flavor & salt (so you can adjust the final taste), and hold up well, however, I wouldn't recommend them as a superior "stand alone" to eat by themselves, which was the primary reason I bought them. I got them on sale, so at least the price was reasonable.<br /><br />I took off one point each for flavor, and too much salt<br /><br />Bottom Line: Suitable for recipes, don't recommend as a stand-alone olive for appetizer/snack.

I am a fan of many Now products, and this offering through Amazon is no exception. I highly recommend this product. The larger size bags of seeds with free shipping make this deal complete for me.
