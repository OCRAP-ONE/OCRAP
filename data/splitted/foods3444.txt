review/summary: Miracle rice
review/text: This ZERO calorie rice substitute is the answer to every no-carb dieters prayer. The liquid they are packed in has a distinct fermented odour and they recommend rinsing them well. This doesn't really get rid of the smell but, after some experimentation, I found that drizzling vinegar over them and letting them sit for a minute, then rinsing again, removes all trace. After they are rinsed, fry them with a bit of cooking spray to dry them, this gives a better texture, then add your favorite sauce or just stirfry veggies, noodles and soy for an almost no-cal snack anytime. They do have more of a gel texture than a grain texture but hey! for zero calories, it's a great meal stretcher or afternoon snack for dieters.

review/summary: No carb diet great substitute
review/text: If one has a palate for rice, this is not a the substitute. It is a way of filling a void when there are few foods which have no carbs and yet can serve the purpose of rice in certain dishes with sauces. No, good for sushi, rice pudding, although haven't tried rice pudding. I made stuffed cabbage with it and they were delicious. If you know how to mix spices you can use this as a substitute for barley or rice. It is filling without the calories or carbs.

review/summary: Wonderfully addicting espresso
review/text: This is a warning: A love for good espresso is an expensive habit!!!<br /><br />I've been making my own espresso at home for 20 years. Every morning I would grind the beans, measure and tamp them into the filter, add water, steam my milk, and then wash the entire machine and repeat. I have to wake up early because this is a time consuming process. I've tried other pod machines, and they just don't make a good cup of espresso.<br /><br />I recently began using the illy Francis Francis Y1 with iperEspresso capsules, and the result is better than my manual method, and takes a little over a minute a cup.<br /><br />Generally, I take my cappuccino cup and heat an ounce of milk in the microwave for 30 seconds, use a hand frother for just a few seconds, press the button on the Y1, and in about 20 seconds it brews a 1 or 2 ounce shot of perfect espresso (you have to depress the button when you think it is finished - there is no auto shutoff). Wham, bam, done!<br /><br />As far as I know, the iperEspresso system is the only "pod" that comes close to a real cup of espresso with crema. And this crema is really a thing of beauty. If you don't know what I'm talking about, try it once and you'll understand. As someone who likes strong coffee, the dark roast is almost not strong enough, but the flavor is so well balanced. It's the perfect blend of bitter and sweet with a body worth savoring.<br /><br />This isn't cheap, and it's more wasteful than grinding your own beans. So take that into consideration. But, I've only had espresso this good in Italy. Constant trips to Italy would be very wasteful and expensive, so that's my barely rational justification.<br /><br />I'd also like to share that the Y1 seems to be the most affordable offering in illy's line of iperEspresso systems. It retails for $295, but illy offers a promotion where you can buy the Y1 for $125 when you order a minimum of 2 canisters (21 count) through illy's website (illyusa.com). There are no other requirements to fulfill. So the machine and the coffee adds up to less than the cost of the machine itself. I took advantage of this deal and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />This coffee will put a new spin on your day. Not to sound too cheesy, but I can't wait to wake up each morning and enjoy my first cup.

review/summary: The BEST espresso I've had from a simple machine
review/text: I've always equated cost and complexity with espresso - the more complicated and overpriced the machine, the better the taste. No longer. While the individual capsules aren't cheap (about .70 cents each), the machine is well priced at $400. We go through at least 3 cans a month. Each and every cup is perfect!!! The crema is rich and long lasting. No bitterness. Smooth, rich, and delicious...

review/summary: Good for the convenience
review/text: I use the dark roast iperEspresso pods every workday morning and anytime I don't have time to make real espresso.  By "real" I mean beans that I selected myself, ground right before brewing, and brewed in my manual La Pavoni.  I have time to make "real" espresso only on weekends.  If you like espresso and want a somewhat decent shot really fast w/o _any_ mess whatsoever, iperEspresso is for you.  I give these 4 stars for two reasons -- a) even the dark roast is not strong enough for me (a blessing in disguise, actually), and b) I hate waisting all this plastic -- the pods are not recycleable.  However, I haven't found a faster, more convenient way to make somewhat decent espresso w/o the need to wash absolutely anything (great crema too, btw!).

review/text: I have been an Illy drinker for 8 years or so.  Previously I was making their drip and espresso in regular makers.  After purchasing one of the Illy capsule machines last year, I have been hooked.  There is no better way to make espresso in my opinion.  Each pod produces the same flavor and crema (cream)on top of the shot.  The dark roast is a nice dark, even roast and I have never had any burnt taste from any of their pods.  Recommended for sure now that the Amazon price on the dark roast is starting to come down.

review/summary: Excellent flavor, but you pay for it.
review/text: Everyone complaining about the price should really take a walk to a coffee store or caffe. Coffee has risen in price the past couple years. Add to that the euro and you'll know why these capsules are more money.<br /><br />BTW, currently Amazon has a 6 pack of canes for 89.99. That's free shipping and comes out to $14.99 which is what the cans costed when they initially rolled out the iperEspresso system.<br /><br />I have been using the black can for some time now. Do not even consider buying the red, medium, roast. This dark roast is exactly what espresso should be like, dark and bold and delicious.  The crema produced from this coffee is very very good.  sugar will sometimes just sit on the top, as a proper espresso should.<br /><br />My review is for the black top can, which is my favorite one.<br /><br />I have also tried the red, blue and green.  I've already given my impression on the red, it's so-so.  The blue top can is for luongo(long) shots. These are excellent for making an Americano.  Use two of these pods plus very hot water(6-8ozs) and you'll have an absolutely delicious Americano coffee.<br /><br />The green top cans are decaf and I am not a big fan of decaf but they are decent. I always have a can around for when guests like to have a decaf espresso.<br /><br />So each espresso will cost you 95 cents.  While that is a pretty hefty price, you are getting caffe quality espresso, which would run you about $2 in any coffee shop.  It's a lifestyle choice, you could always get a stove top macchinetta from Bialetti and make espresso that way but you will never ever achieve the quality and crema like these illy capsules produce.<br /><br />Enjoy your coffee everyone!

review/summary: Illy iperespresso
review/text: I would give the iperEspresso Capsules a 3 for quality and convenience and for those preferring single shots over lattes it would be a reasonable choice if budget is no object. One capsule per cup is not satisfying and I find myself routinely using two capsules which starts becoming expensive. Switching between steam and coffee functions is a many step process similar to a manual machine. Now I will use my iperEspresso machine only when I travel or if I am serving company since it is faster than a manual machine.<br />Overall my old illy Francis Francis X5 (if reviewed I would give it 5 stars) is much more to my liking since I can select from any coffees that interest me, grind the beans myself, and use the double shot filter for each cup. Also it accepts the illy E.S.E pods as an option. Further I like the sturdy metal construction over the plastic iperEspresso machine I choose.<br /><br />Illy iperEspresso is a good system but turned out not being appropriate for me.

review/summary: Flawless espresso, flawed delivery
review/text: The iperEspresso system is the best yet in terms of automating and simplifying espresso. No surprise, welcome to Illy. They created a perfect method of getting the exact amount of espresso coffee into a machine, with a minimum amount of mess, that consistently produces an excellent pull. The only control that the operator has is the one that they would want, that is the amount of espresso produced.<br /><br />The problem stems from the way the capsules are packaged and delivered. For some reason, Illy chose a cheap-ass can that is pressurized with an inert gas. That causes the lid not to fit right until after the inner seal is pulled. Once you do that, the same lid loosely fits over the now air-exposed capsules. This makes absolutely no sense give that other capsule manufacturers go to great lengths to keep individual capsules sealed until ready for use. Why Illy did not consult with Lavazza on how to accomplish this relatively simple task is beyond me. Then you have the bulky can to dispose of when the capsules are gone.<br /><br />Why the '1'? Just to draw attention to this review. Anyone who has had a cup of espresso made with an iperEspresso machine will be shocked because it is indeed the best espresso possible, a barista can do no better with a $10,000 Gaggia. Maybe Illy will listen and fix the problem.

You simply cannot beat this cracker for mouth feel if you like plenty of snap, and the pecan flavor of this cracker is amazing. They are wonderful with dips, but they are so delicious, I actually prefer to eat them plain.<br /><br />At only 8 calories per cracker, they compare favorably to my mini pretzels, which are 5 calories each.<br /><br />Blue Diamond is known for nuts and products made with nuts, and they have two other nut flavors for these crackers besides pecan: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H154US">almond</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HP5FV2">hazelnut</a>.

I buy 5 of these at a time - they are one of my standard go-to's!

It doesn't swell up much, but makes an adequate sized loaf.<br /><br />There's no kneading involved. Just mix the cup of hot water with the sugar and yeast they provide. After 3 minutes, stir in the flour mixture and stir with a spoon. The dough is stiff and you place it on a greased cookie sheet. Shape it around the edges to be a round loaf or an elongated one.<br /><br />It goes in the 400 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes. So allow one hour from start to finish.<br /><br />It's great with soup. This one had a tasty Italian herb flavor.

review/text: I bought one single for my Lab. Yep, he did! He ate it in a matter of minutes. When I say, "it", I mean the whole thing! That includes a buncha one-inch bones. I had no idea there were so many in this thing! I would never knowingly give a large dog any bone so small. How do I know there were little bones in it? He's regurgitating them---and painfully I might add. Yep, I am now very worried for him. Yes, he was watched. Labs aren't animals that like to "drop it" when they have something in their mouths that they intend on eating. We did manage to toss about 5 bones, he's tossed another 4, so I am wondering how many more there are. YIKES! He did enjoy it however. :-/

review/summary: Good for smaller dogs
review/text: I purchased one of these hoofers at my local PetCo and my small 16lb mixed breed loves it. The "Hoofer" is the whole hoof of a bovine, the toes with the bones and meat and skin all there. It is dried and not cured, which I am really pleased with. Because it is the whole foot I wouldn't recommend this for dogs that like to swallow large pieces off of their chews. For my small dog it is great, even though it is as big as his head, he loves it!<br /><br />It doesn't smell bad like sometimes just the clipped hoof can, and infact even when my dog has been chewing on it for a long session I don't notice it being smelly. I've had rawhides after being chewed smell pretty bad (from the curing chemicals I guess?) but this hoofer doesn't smell gross. Even though it has more stuff in it than just a rawhide it doesn't get super stinky, a big plus for our apartment since we can't leave chews outside.<br /><br />Over all I recommend this hoofer as a good alternative to rawhides. If you have a big dog you may want to monitor them since it does have the toe bones inside and they are small.

review/summary: Does not dry overnight; thick gel hard to apply evenly
review/text: Wilton's Black Sparkle Gel icing looks and tastes good, but the thick gel is difficult to apply evenly.  I used it on sugar cookies to make "ladybug spots and antennae," which worked out fine, but the applicator and thickness of the icing made drawing fine lines (e.g., for piping ladybug "heads") very difficult.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is that this icing does not dry quickly (I left my cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight, at which point the icing was still wet.  After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.  I would not recommend this for decorating cookies; after 2 to 3 days for drying, your baked goods will have lost much of their freshness.

review/text: I love the cinnamon taste and I just love this, in general. If you like really sweet cereals and sugary cereals then I'd buy this. It does taste like cinnamon toast in the same sense that a toaster strudel tastes like an actual strudel or the way Cookie Crisp tastes like cookies. Cereal lovers will understand.<br /><br />I'm an adult, though. I wouldn't want my kid to eat this every day because of the sugar content but a box (or 1.5 lb bag in this case) a week would be reasonable, I think, between a couple of kids.<br /><br />As an adult, I get maybe 6-8 giant bowlfuls per 3lb box of this. Each 3 lb box has two large bags of cereal and each bag makes me 3-4 adult sized bowls.<br /><br />For a child, I would imagine this would last a couple weeks. It's about the same price as stores and possibly 50 cents to a dollar cheaper at the local grocery store.<br /><br />For most cases, it saves me time and gas money to order online. Too bad Amazon can't send me a gallon of milk in a pinch.

review/summary: Almost the best
review/text: I start my day with a big mug of Twinings Early Grey with a bit of sugar added.  There are no American brand Earl Grey teas that match it.  Safeway carries a brand called "The Orginal Ceylon Tea Company" that comes close, but none of the others (Tazo, Bigelow, etc.) have teas that I find worth drinking.<br />In England, Harrods Earl Grey No. 42 is my favorite and is actually much better than Twinings, but it is unavailable in the US.  Their tea is blended by Williamson (formerly Williamson & Magor), and Williamson has their own Earl Grey which is as good if not better than Harrods.  It is a more complex flavor than Twinings.  It is available over the Internet.<br />The catering bag (as it is usually called) of 100 teabags usually is the best price, but difficult to find in the store.<br />Twinings still has their original tea shop in London, located on the Strand, and well worth a visit if you are in London.  It has been there since the 1720's.

review/summary: Among the best Earl Grey tea available
review/text: I enjoy a good cup of tea and my absolute favorite is Earl Grey. Twinings Early Grey is among the best on the market, alongside Rishi loose leaf. A traditional English tea, Earl Grey is a black tea whose principle flavor is from the rind of bergamot oranges. Although there are various accounts of its origin, it is most likely was an Indian recipe (China is also a commonly attributed with creating the recipe) which made its way to England in the early 1800s. Named after Lord Grey, the tea is a flavorful black tea that is best served nearly boiling hot with or without lemon. It is NOT served with cream.<br /><br />Twinings is one of the oldest conveyors of Earl Grey and still use the same recipe as they have for well over a hundred years (soon to be two-hundred). Their tea is also endorsed by the 6th Earl Grey and his signature appears on their packaging. Not that this means the tea is superior because of any endorsement; in this case the tea speaks for itself.<br /><br />While I do prefer loose leaf teas, these tea bags provide nearly the same flavor profile as the loose variety and will not disappoint the Earl Grey enthusiast. If you've never tried Twinings, you owe it to yourself to do so. Enjoy!

review/summary: terrific product, terrific price!
review/text: For many years I used dried minced garlic in many dishes, much preferring it to the powdered, often salted type.  We used to be able to get it at a local big box store, which unfortunately stopped carrying it.  I like not only the convenience, but the taste.  This does not have any additives like most of the blends, and most significantly does not have salt (which many companies add because it is a preservative and adds cheap bulk!  I like being able to control what I add to recipes, which means adding salt when I want it, and not when I do not!  I use a lot of garlic in my cooking and usually have fresh on hand.  There are times when I actually prefer the dried.  It is a more concentrated flavor, so if you are adding it to a sauce where it will absorb some of the liquid you can get a more intense flavor than you can with the fresh.<br />Then, there is the obvious advantage that it does not spoil as fast.  In fact, I have never had it spoil (and I live in a humid environment where things go off rather quickly).<br />When this disappeared from my local store in bulk I had to buy it in small spice jars *for vastly more than this costs* something on the order of 10- 20x the price!  What you get from Amazon is an enormous amount (given that it is typically sold in 1 oz spice jars) which I suspect would last most people a long long time.  I transferred one of the bags to a quart jar and after a month (in the tropics) it is still dry & fresh. This is something I like well enough that having used it I do not want to be without it, and yes, did pay over 10x as much in the supermarket before I found it at Amazon.  I hope this is something they continue to stock, an item which I now consider a staple.

review/summary: Frontier Minced Garlic
review/text: Frontier products are awesome. They arrived in a sealed Mylar type bags. Since most of us usually use shaker type containers for spices, I simply empty the contents into a container that is running low, and/or I use tomato sauce jars, which have been cleaned out, to store my bulk spices. I do a lot of food storage, so the one pound bags are cheaper than purchasing smaller containers of minced onions, and are about the same cost when compared to dehydrating my own onions. Highly recommended. Frontier offers organic products as well. Just search amazon to find the best price. Highly recommended.

review/text: Scharffen Berger makes one of the best semisweet baking chocolates around. If you are looking to bake with higher-quality ingredients, consider this product.  I use a brownie recipe that others use, and I am constantly asked why my brownies taste so much better.  My answer?  Don't over-stir, and use quality ingredients, most importantly, the chocolate.  Don't be surprised to see that it is much darker than the regular store-bought baking chocolates, as the concentration of cacao is much higher than those.  If you are a true chocolate aficionado - and I'm not talking about sweet milk chocolates - then you will love this semisweet option.  Try the bittersweet, too!

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: What I had wanted was lavender water for baking, but thought I would try this syrup instead. While I have not yet used it in baking, I am loving it in my iced tea! I drink hibiscus tea on a regular basis, and have begun adding a splash of lavender syrup to each glass. It is refreshing and so delicious, and is also very good in lemonade. I am a trained aromatherapist and as such, am very familiar with the health benefits associated with lavender. I have included some of them below:<br /><br />Lavender is an excellent nerve tonic that may help treat migraines, headaches, anxiety and nervous tension. It is often used for insomnia in smaller amounts; in larger amounts has been used to increase mental activity. Lavender has been used extensively to treat burns and pain associated with sore muscles and joints. It helps restore hormonal balance and may reduce associated menstrual cramping. Lavender is widely used for respiratory ailments, colds, flu and sinus congestion. Added to a beverage, lavender is soothing for sore throats and laryngitis. Lavender stimulates the production of gastric juices and bile and thus aiding in treatment of indigestion, stomach pain, colic, flatulence, vomiting and diarrhea. Regular use of lavender essential oil is said to provide resistance to disease.<br /><br />UPDATE: Bebop Trading Co. is the absolute WORST vendor I have ever dealt with on Amazon. I placed a re-order with them and was very unhappy. They are playing a little game on here by offering the product at $5 and then charging $10 for the shipping. My advice to them is that if you can't play with the 'big dogs' stay out of the game! Seriously, you could get the product faster by Pony Express. Buy from a reputable company.

review/summary: GORGEOUS & FLORAL
review/text: I must admit that I love all floral flavors (Violet, Rose, Lavender & Jasmine)so this syrup did not disappoint me.  I have used it mainly in Italian Soda's, because it is so refreshing in the summer, but it's also lovely in tea. It has a beautiful color (it does have a little food color in it) and flavor when used just with soda/seltzer water, or as an unusual ice cream topping for a plain vanilla.  I am going to experiment with it some more in my dessert recipes(& I am also going to buy the rose & violet flavors as well). I feel the aroma is sufficiently lavender and while the flavor is sweet (because of added sugar), it is clearly marked a SYRUP, not just an essence, so be careful when ordering if you require the flavor for a certain recipe.

review/text: This is a great product. I love lavender white mochas, but the cafe I go to that used to make them quit carrying the syrup. All I have to do now is add a couple pumps of this syrup to a plain white mocha, and I get exactly what I want. Best of all, I can adjust the amount of lavender flavor I want.  I also plan to use this in some cakes during this upcoming holiday season.<br /><br />Some more details: It is about the same consistency as other syrups you can buy to add to coffee. It is definitely on the thin side--don't expect it to be like pancake syrup; the consistency is more like real maple syrup. I bought the pump to go along with it since I knew I would want it eventually, and the shipping was cheaper if I went ahead and got the pump with the syrup. I don't know if other pumps would fit on the bottle, but the Monin brand one fits perfectly. It will make the height of the bottle much taller; I keep mine on my wine bar, which doesn't have a top. It wouldn't fit easily inside a standard cabinet. But if you like lavender, it's worth finding a place for it in your kitchen!

It tasted so wonderful that I decided to make it for myself.  After three attempts at brewing, I was ready to give up; process was tedious, results were wildly variable, and it took a fair amount of time. Decided to Google for an actual standardized recipe and came across this syrup. Put simply, a great idea! Time saving, uniform sweet flavor, and much less fuss. So far I've tried this in iced black, green, and white teas, all the aformentioned as hot tea, lemonade, and over lemon sherbert in a tuile as a dessert at a dinner party (everybody loved it).

I don't need soy-flavored mouth wash and I can't think of anything else to do with it.  Down the drain they go.  Don't confuse with Kikkoman Marudaizu soy, which is extraordinary.

review/summary: it matters not to me that this is corn and gluten-free...It's simply my favorite tasting chip!
review/text: For me, these are addictive.I HATE rice chips so don't think for a minute they have that taste or texture. These are made of only good stuff, nothing artificial, and are so light and crispy...just barely a hint of bean but full of fiber and protein and things you never get in a chip. They are cooked in a healthy oil full of monounsaturated fat and sprinkled with sea salt.<br /><br />The flavor is so light it doesn't matter what you pair them with.  But, unlike regular tortilla chips, I love these straight up plain with no dipping sauce. The taste is that good to me.  They don't taste like a healthy or alternative chip yet you get quite a bit for little calories, a great amount of protein and fiber and the healthy fat.<br /><br />they are also high in potassium and cholesterol free.  Better yet since, unlike most chips, these are high in protein, it's a snack that fills you up and keeps you there<br /><br />They are low glycemic so there is no sugar or carb crash and blood sugar spike with hunger soon after eating, they are corn free for those with corn allergies and gluten-free for those with wheat allergies as well.<br /><br />rock on, Beanitos.

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.
review/text: Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.  I highly recommend that you try them.

review/summary: Beanitos is the answer for a corn free chip!
review/text: Just tried (and finished) my 1st bag of Beanitos Black Bean and Flax chips and they are really FAB!!!  So glad to have a good tasting, nutritional chip to have with salsa; I am to avoid all corn products and that can really be difficult!  A great find:)

review/summary: Delicious and Nutritious!
review/text: We love the black bean beanitos!  They taste great, and also have fiber in them.  If you like black beans, you will soon become addicted to these!  (We didn't like the pinto bean ones as they had too much omega in them and tasted like fish oil)
