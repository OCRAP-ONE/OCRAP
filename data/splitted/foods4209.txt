review/summary: Thrifty buy
review/text: If you are looking for a nice GF flour, sorghum is one of our favorites.  We don't use it alone, but mix it in with quinoa that we grind ourselves to make a tasty flour for things like donuts, cakes, etc.  Amazon has the best price that I have found, making this a great thrifty buy for the GF baker.

review/summary: Great tasting
review/text: I have never tasted sorghum before, so I was pleasantly surprised by how nice this tastes. I use it for gluten-free baking since most of the books I have, recommended it or called for it in a recipe. This is so MUCH better than any of the other fava/garbanzo mixes by far. I could not get those flavors to work for me, somehow they were too beany/metallic or something. I made a cornbread with this, tapioca and potato starch and my family loved it. I think some people find this flour hard to get, but if possible, get it. It will give your baked goods a lot more texture, flavor and feel compared to rice flour.

review/summary: Great product & value
review/text: Sorghum flour is pretty much a staple for gluten free baking - I use it for pancakes, bread, cakes, cookies etc and go through quite a bit of it.  Unfortunately, it's not always that easy to find in the store and I always end up having to check a few places.<br /><br />The pack of 4 from amazon ships in a Bob's Red Mill box which is placed inside a larger Amazon box so the bags arrive in perfect condition.  I find that the price on here is better than what you typically find in the store.  If you plan on doing a decent amount of baking I highly recommend ordering this product, but if you're not sure how much you'll go through or have never baked with sorghum flour before I would recommend buying it at the store and trying it out before buying it in such a large quantity.

It's good flour, and the bag's a good size for baking for a small family - also a good shape that will stand up on the counter while you scoop flour out of it.

review/summary: GF flour good taste & texture
review/text: I have only been cooking a GF diet for 18 months so I am still learning, but I have found the sweet white sorghum flour to be among my favorites for cookies & breads.  The cost to buy in local stores is so expensive that I searched for less costly ways to make my own foods without the high costs and get variety of gf flours.  Amazon had good prices when bought in bulk and since the gf flour bags are so small anyway, it works out well for me.  I have found gf flours keep well so far, so this is also helpful.  It's a good product.

review/summary: Not as Good as Regular Bar
review/text: I agree with another reviewer in that this bar is not as good as the regular Fiber One bars. Those come in around 140 calories per bar and are much more filling then this 90 calorie variety. I find that I am still hungry after eating this kind and tend to reach for something else - which pushes me up past the 140 calories anyway.<br /><br />The flavor and texture also reminds me of stale or old popcorn. Or maybe packing foam. Not good.<br /><br />Go ahead and buy the regular fiber bars and add a another five to ten minutes to your workout routine to offset the calories. You'll be glad you did.

review/summary: Great testing, Very little Sugar
review/text: First the price...not really that bad. Cheaper then Walmart, but can be found at Odd Lots on occasion 1 dollar less. Sams also has the higher counts less also, but this price is less then the general food stores. As I said, sometimes they don't have them..here they do.<br /><br />This is a sweet tasting wholesome snack. Being on a low sugar diet, this fits the bill very well. At 90 calories, much more fulfilling then lets say a cheese snack (that can have over 120 calories plus the fat issues unless you get 2%) and are much smaller. Quaker oats makes a version of it, but they are too sweet for my tastes. This fits the bill for me, it's taste is great, and gives me that boost I need. Good Fiber content.<br /><br />With all this stuff on obesity, it seems to be getting harder to find good diet foods that are relatively healthly. They make claims on fancy packages, (I bought "low calorie yogurt" once, and the only reason was they made the size smaller, much like Lean Cusine does at times) but these ar every bit as large as their 150 calories counterparts and just plain tastes better.

They are high fiber(20% DV), 4 g protein, low in sodium and saturated fat.  They also have omega 3 with the flax seed.  They have a crispy crunch and are corn and gluten free.  10 chips are about 140 calories.  If you're having a southwest party, these might be fun to put out for appetizers along with tortilla chips and salsa.  They have an original taste which I like.

review/summary: Sweet Tree Organic Coconut Palm Sugar Blonde
review/text: Sweet Tree Organic Palm Sugar Blonde is the very best tasting of all the palm sugars.  It is easy to mix into warm or cold foods and tastes like a light brown sugar when baked or broiled.  It is no more expensive than any other palm sugars -- and it is organic.  Hopefully, Sweet Tree will make this available to us in larger quantities.  I bake, roast, broil and boil using the Sweet Tree palm sugar every week. Although palm sugar may not be for everyone, I was a border line diabetic, but after using many other artificial sweeteners with no success, palm sugar has helped to bring my AIC sugar level readings under diabetic levels. (Every individual reacts differently to sugar and artifical sweeteners. If you are diabetic it is very important when making a change to your diet to check your sugar levels at the appropriate time after consuming any unfamiliar sugar or sweetener products.)

review/summary: Perhaps the tastiest of the tobascos
review/text: Living in Tejas, we love  our spicy southwest foods. A bottle of hot sauce is never far from hand at meal time. One of my favorites is the Chipotle tobasco sauce.<br /><br />Only slightly ironically, I first sampled Chipotle tobasco at a Chipotle's restaurant several years ago. I was instantly hooked. Regular tobasco adds a lot of heat to any meal, but relatively little enjoyable flavor. Not so with this little bottle.<br /><br />The chipotle tobasco is all about the wonderful smoky flavor, with only a relatively small level of heat and unpleasantness. My sons (both under 10) even enjoy its flavor, not finding it too harsh or pungent.<br /><br />If all you're interested in is showing off your manliness by eating outrageous sauces, then pass this bottle by. If you're interested in making simple meals a little more exciting, then this is the condiment for you!

The first thing I do when I open or refill a bottle of Tabasco Chipotle sauce, is add 1-2 teaspoons of a much hotter hot sauce, like Mad Dog 357 Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce (has a BBQ-like flavor), Dave's Ultimate Insanity Hot Sauce, or Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce, then I shake up the bottle and I have a great tasting hot sauce that's adequately hot, but not too hot that it has to be diluted.

Regular Tabasco is, as the name suggests, made with ground tabasco chilis soaked in vinegar and the result is a very simple but lousy sauce: salty and with a strong, instant, biting burn and no flavor to speak of other than vinegar. It can be used to add necessary heat to heavily flavored dishes when nothing else is available, but the flavor sucks and I'd sooner eat my pizza plain than ruin it with that crap.<br /><br />Tabasco Chipotle is made with smoked jalapenos (chipotles) and is a lot thicker than regular Tabasco. It has an excellent smoky flavor and not a lot of heat, but just enough to let you know it's there. An important point is that the burn isn't progressive and never overwhelms your mouth; regular Tabasco has a cumulative burn and a definite point at which the intensity of the burn completely negates your ability or desire to eat more. That never happens with Tabasco Chipotle, so it's great for pouring and dipping when you're actually looking for flavor. I eat probably a bottle of this stuff a week and it's good to eat on just about everything and also makes an awesome meat marinade. Mix it with mayonnaise, you've got chipotle mayo.<br /><br />A better comparison in terms of heat might be between this and the cayenne-based red pepper sauces (Frank's Red Hot, Crystal, Texas Pete, etc.) This isn't a nose-hair scorcher and it respects your taste buds and tries to work with your food instead of taking over and dominating. A lot of people seem to think that hot sauce is about pushing your pain threshold to the limit, but in my experience you're either in it primarily for the flavor or primarily for the pain. This sauce definitely falls on the more flavorful side of hot sauces, and I strongly recommend you try it if you've never tried chipotle sauces before.

review/summary: tasty but not strong enough
review/text: Sporting the curse of the Chilehead, I find Tabasco Chipotle lively, but leaving me not only wanting - but needing - more smokiness, more richness and more burn; essentially, more Chiptole. Before you buy this again at the supermarket, I invite you to search out El Yucateco Salsa Chipotle (5 oz). This hot sauce ratchets things up a bit and is truer in taste to Chipotle proper. Even better, just pickup a small can of Chipoltes in Adobo (Spanish foods aisle or store), blend in a food processor, thinning with distilled white or cider vinegar to desired consistency and cut with some brown sugar to balance it out. It might take a little tweaking, but jar that puppy up and you're good to go - with the real deal.

review/text: Tabasco brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce is a vinegar based hot sauce made with chipotle peppers (smoked jalapeno peppers), and spices such as garlic and onion, and is absolutely delicious!! It has a smooth, rich, smokey, complex, hot flavor that's awesome on chili, tacos, fajitas, popcorn, any Tex-Mex style food, or to really kick up a salsa... by far, my favorite Tabasco product!

review/text: I just returned from spending the holidays in Houston, TX.  Stopped by a place called "Willy's", where they had this sauce on each table.  It blew my mind!  I think it is the TASTIEST of all the hot sauces.  It has heat, but the flavor of the chipotle shines through.  I am a true convert.  I can see me having a long and wonderful relationship with this Tabasco brand product!  Try it, you will like it!

review/summary: Tabasco's Best.  I'm not generally a fan of Tabasco products but their Chipotle is superior
review/text: This Chipotle Sauce offers some gentle heat along with the rich taste of a smoked Chipotle pepper. It makes a great Bloody/Virgin Mary and will add some interesting flavors to any dish that needs some heat. As another reviewer said -- this is probably the best tasting product within Tabasco's ever expanding lineup.<br /><br />I've taste tested 7 different Chipotle hot sauces and the Tabasco Chipotle is one of my favorites. The taste is very rich, smokey, semi-sweet and, for once, there is not too much vinegar! Yet make no mistake - there is a good dose of vinegar yet it is not over powering. It is quite simply one of the best Chipotle sauces I have taste tested.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this sauce is relatively mild when compared to the other Tabasco products.  In this particular sauce, the heat is far more subdued and not what I would have  expected from a Tabasco product. This sauce needs to viewed as a completely different product.  This is the best tasting Tabasco sauce I've ever tasted and beyond that -- near the best tasting Chipotle I have found.<br /><br />I paid $3.29 for it at my local supermarket. I doubt you'll have any trouble finding it locally and since tastes differ - I'd recommend you first buy a single bottle close to home. Then purchase a half gallon on-line.<br /><br />What sets this chipotle apart is the richness of its flavor. It is concentrated in the best possible sense. Rich, with some sweetness, smokey, some vinegar and a bit of gentle heat.<br /><br />I have repeatedly taste tested the following Chipotle:  Tabasco, La Victoria, El Pato, Cholula, Goya, Bufalo and El Yucateco.<br /><br />The El Yucateco Chipotle is also superb and the only worthy competitor to this sauce. Both are rich - the Tabasco has more vinegar and the El Yucateco has a bit more sugar and a hint of tomato.

review/summary: A great Tex-Mex sauce from...Louisiana(?!)
review/text: Yep, it's one of the truly great chipotle sauces around.  It's probably my favorite chipotle sauce although there are a few others that are in still in the running.  It really tastes nothing like the original Tabasco, another favorite hot sauce of mine.  I probably use the chipotle sauce more than the original Tabasco.  One of my favorite ways to use it is in spicing up ranch-style dressings for use in salads and dips.  It works wonders in barbeque sauce and to spice up bastes to use on the smoker.  Great smokey flavor.

A 'Scoville Unit' is actually a measure of capsaicin (the chemical in hot peppers that is responsible for their heat).<br /><br />Scoville's test was a comparative taste test that is considered subjective by today's standards. A more sophisticated method is in use today, but in honor of Wilbur Scoville, the unit of measure is still called the Scoville.<br /><br />The capsaicin level in peppers can vary from plant to plant due to local environmental conditions. This means that a pepper's rating is an average measure.<br /><br />The hottest pepper on record is the Bhut Jolokia with a pungency of over 1 million Scoville Heat Units (1,001,304, to be exact). By contrast, the Bell Pepper comes in at less than 100 Scoville Heat Units."

review/text: For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tabasco Brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce has set itself apart from the others.  Tabasco Brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce is hotter than most hot sauces that I like, but I do not consider it to be an overpowering heat.  It is a good, nice-tasting hot sauce to have around, and I recommend it.

There are however, two very minor drawbacks, but not serious enough to keep me from buying this producct again.  There is no way to adjust the grind for fine, or coarse.  Lastly, it is very difficult to turn the grinder because it's small, and I can't get a good grip on it.

review/summary: Sometimes simple is better
review/text: I love freshly ground pepper and especially love a little kick that having red peppercorns in a mix provide, so I normally use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019S5444">Alessi Whole Mix Peppercorns, 1.12-Ounce Grinder (Pack of 6)</a>. There are times, however, when all I want is freshly ground black pepper, like when I am having vine-ripened tomatoes, insalada Caprese, and the such. That's where this product comes in.<br /><br />The peppercorns are high quality and give off a nice aroma when ground. Like its more colorful sibling, the grinding mechanism tends to produce very coarse pepper, so if you prefer yours to be finer, a dedicated grinder may better suit your needs.  I have had no problems with the grinding mechanism - I use a clockwise-counterclockwise motion and it works well. Too well if I am not careful because it will grind a lot of pepper with minimal motion. It does not clog like some dedicated grinders, which is another plus.<br /><br />This is a convenient way to enjoy fresh ground pepper, and - in my opinion - is priced low considering that the grinder is disposable and I get nearly nine months of use from a package of six of these.<br /><br />I always have one on my table (in the kitchen I use a dedicated grinder that allows me to adjust the grind.)

review/summary: Better than many choices out there
review/text: While this isn't my very top choice of cat foods available, it has worked very well as a transition food for the six months that we need an all-stages food until our kitten gets older.  When she was very small, we were able to give her her own kitten food by setting up her feeding station in a box that our adult cat couldn't get into.  Now that they are the same size, we can't keep them from stealing each other's food, so we needed something they could both eat.  We tried a couple of holistic all-stages foods, and this one has been the best, by far.  Both cats prefer the little "T" shape kibble over round kibble, they seem to enjoy the taste, and it keeps them and their digestive systems happy ... and that keeps ME happy.  ;-)  My older cat does better on a grain-free food, and has gotten a case of the itchies on this food, but it is not nearly as bad as with most grain-inclusive foods we've tried.  Once kitten is old enough, they will both be back on a grain-free diet.  In the meantime, this has really fit our needs.

review/summary: Put good in, get good out
review/text: CLIFFS: 100% Recommended from a paranoid, research crazy owner who wanted nothing but the best for my kitten.<br /><br />FULL REVIEW: My kitten loves this food. As with all kitten/cats you learn they have personalities, specific tastes and favorites.<br /><br />I spent a lot of time researching cat food and discovered so much BAD food out there.<br /><br />THE KEY TO KEEPING YOUR CAT HEALTHY IS GOOD FOOD AND EXERCISE, READ THE INGREDIANTS, THE FIRST 5 ITEMS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT AND ARE THE LARGEST PORTIONS OF THE FOOD.<br /><br />Research indicates this is one of the best all around foods you can feed your cat/kitten. We started with K****nchow, which in the word of cat food is about a 5 outa 10 in quality, its got the #'s but not the wholesome natural ingredients from which they derive. Think about taking a vitamin vs. eating veggies.<br /><br />This brand doesn't pack the most protein (which is crucial to cat development) but its well over the recommended amount, and quiet frankly, I'm not comfortable with a heavy protein diet, I believe there can be too much of a good thing.<br /><br />This grain free food also has lots of actual vegetables and items you can identify in the food itself.<br /><br />This food smells almost fit for human consumption, you can pick up the flavors just by the scent, doesn't smell like typical big brand crap.<br /><br />Many reviews claim softer and shinier coat and I have to agree. I've had a few cats the past 20yrs and hers by far is the softest coat I've ever felt.<br /><br />What I find great is she ignored the K****nchow when wet was out, but now will often choose this to snack on when the wet food has been out a hour or 2.<br /><br />This is good on her stomach and stools are not overly smelly like they were on other brand food we started initially. The food itself doesn't overly smell either.<br /><br />Provides plenty of lasting energy too.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased and could not recommend it more. Pricier? Of course. But its absolutely worth it at the rate she eats this. A bag this size lasts our kitten at least 4 months. For 30 bucks?! Why not?!

Sure enough, they became more excited about eating. Since it is a bit pricey for our cat food budget, we mix it half and half with the less expensive food. They always pick this out to eat first. We'll be buying more for them.

review/summary: Preferred Choice to Supplement a Canned Food Diet.
review/text: I tried a few dry food brands after the pet food recall of 2007.  I tried some grain free, and noticed some problems from the cats.  I tried going all wet - but apparently - my 17 yo needs some of the grains in dry food,  Their main food of choice (I'm not much of one for switching - had trouble with Turkey and Salmon flavors) is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>.<br /><br />I started with this Dry when it was Eagle Pack Holistic Select.  The formula was EU certified (which has a higher degree of ingredient integrity than US pet foods).  Since then, this company merged with the new owners of Wellness - so the 2 brands can compliment each other.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />EDIT: 3/24/2011<br />I've switched some things up since the Wellness problems (and still waiting for Wellness Chicken Recipe to Return).<br /><br />I have started rotation feeding wet food, and have found that I use less dry food than before - here is my general shopping list:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  Will be giving the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70V0">Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> a try.<br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a> (Its not grain free, but I personally don't like the mix for the regular, and neither do my cats)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a> (Also not grain free, and Multi protein source. It does contain Herring. However, cats have reacted positively to this food).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />This is why I prefer the smaller bag.  Except for the removal of additional Vitamin K (google on that one), the ingredients haven't changed much since I started in 2008 (when it was EU certified).  For saving Vet Bills - it pays to have kitties on a high quality diet.<br /><br />PS - the bag comes with its own zip lock closure, I've never had a problem with spoilage nor a-toxins.<br />PPS - some have found this a good rotation ONLY, it eases the budget: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOR6">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Turkey & Giblets Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.

The chicken is $2 less than the anchovy & sardine one, but both our cats seem to like the anchovy & sardine better. Overall I will stick with Holistic Select because I believe it to be a high quality cat food, and worth the premium. One of our cats will not eat moist food if his life depended on it so we went with this brand which seems to be one of the best dry foods on the market. I just placed an order for the duck meal Holistic Select so we shall see if that one is a hit too.

review/text: We have 5 cats and when we fed them other dry cat foods (several brands) that contained corn or corn products (genetically modified, I'm sure) and wheat or wheat glutin), we would find one or more throw-ups on the floor just about every morning.  We eventually figured out it was the dry cat food.  We started feeding them Holistic Select which is corn and wheat free. Now we seldom find throw-up and if we do, it's because of hair balls.  What a difference!  We have been sold on Holistic Select Adult and Kitten Health food for the past year and we will continue to use it even though it is a bit costly compared to the other dry foods we were using.  My son and daughter have also switched and experienced the same results.

review/summary: A food that works for both new kitten and fussy adult cat
review/text: My 8 year old cat is one of the fussiest eaters on the planet. She will not even touch a food if she sniffs it and decides she doesn't like the smell of it. I have tried the tactic of just leaving it out and not giving her any other options for food and she just ends up starving. She has been eating a cheap brand of dry cat food with ingredients that I now know are just horrific for cats her whole life. The first five ingredients were brewer's rice, chicken by-product meal, corn meal, chicken fat and soybean meal. As you can probably see, this is a food I was desperate to get her off of. She has also been a very skittish cat and would often have anxiety attacks about seemingly nothing. Like, at the very slightest noise she would literally jump 4 feet in the air from fear and if you were near her or touching her when it happened she would unintentionally scratch you to ribbons in her mad dash to get away. I was sad when this happened because normally she is such a gentle cat and has never bit me in her life, there is no way she would scratch unless she was terrified and completely out of her mind. I had an inkling that the junk food might be exacerbating this problem, much like how gluten and dairy could exacerbate the problems of autistic children.<br /><br />All of my attempts up until now have ended up in failed attempts and money wasted on food she wouldn't eat. This happened again and again and I almost thought it was a lost cause until Holistic Select chicken meal formula. We recently rescued a kitten off the streets and I knew I didn't want to start feeding her the same junk that my older cat had been eating for years. I was looking up some grain-free formulas and decided to go with one of those brands since cats shouldn't really be eating grains. To make a long story short, both the kitten and cat didn't like it. The kitten will nibble on it if there are no other options (she's easier to please, thank goodness), so I've kept it around and leave it out so there's something out when their other food is gone, but all in all, not a success by any means. I had a sample packet of Holistic Select chicken meal lying around that I received probably about a year ago and never got around to giving to my cat and the kitten got at it and bit away at the packaging to get the food inside. I looked at the ingredient list and hey, not too bad! I hoped beyond hope and offered some to my older cat and she eagerly ate it! Hallelujah!<br /><br />So I quickly bought a bag from Amazon and prayed that she would continue eating it. Well, I am now down to a quarter of the bag and I recently had to reorder. Both of the cats eat it with no problems and my older cat actually has far less anxiety attacks. She seems much more calm and is now willing to let my husband come up to her without running away in fear. He can even pet her a little. This is a miraculous change than just a few months ago when the mere sight of him had her diving under the bed. I have recently been eating healthier and I know what a difference it makes for me and there is no difference with our pets. What we feed them has a drastic affect on their well-being and behavior. This is not the absolute best food out there, but it's pretty darn good. I have recently ordered some wet food cans from Holistic Select since I know little kitten will go crazy over that and it's good to supplement the diet with some wet.

review/summary: Only food my cat can eat
review/text: My cat has irritable bowel syndrome which we battled for months when we first got him from the shelter. I must have tried 5 different brands before I finally found Holistic Select. It is the only food that gives him perfectly normal bowel movements. (Yes, even tried blue buffalo and a few other expensive products). I recommend this food to everyone for their animals with delicate stomachs. Plus, it doesn't hurt that he absolutely loves it and the unique shape makes him chew it rather than swallow it whole which means it's good for his teeth too!

review/summary: Premium puppy food at a very good price!
review/text: My apologies in advance for what is a lengthy review.  However, if I can help anyone save a little time compared to what I spent trying to choose a good puppy food, that's my goal.  So I wrote this not only to review the Castor & Pollux product, but also to provide some information on other types of dry dog food.<br /><br />It is no secret that you can buy some very cheap and some very expensive dog/puppy foods.  Common sense tells you that you can spend very little and get lots of filler and by-products, or spend a good deal more and get wholesome, healthy food.  My personal opinion is that long term, both your dog and you are better off if s/he is fed good food.  The little extra money spent now may offset potential medical bills and heartache later.<br />That being the case, I set out to find a really good dog food for my Golden Retriever puppy, while, of course, trying to keep cost down.  I spent a good deal of time researching foods.  I disregarded low end foods that are largely grains, fillers and meat by-products.  I looked at average to premium foods.<br /><br />I narrowed my choices to several including Castor & Pollux Natural Ultramix.  The others were Blue, Eukanuba, Innova EVO, Merrick, Natural Balance, and Wellness.<br /><br />After that I used a few review websites and ratings tables.  These can be helpful.  I used one that starts each perspective food off with 100 points and then subtracts for poor ingredients (example: -10 points of containing by-products) and then adds points for any really good ingredients - vegetables, etc.  The foods are then rated in grades from A through F.  Of my choices, all but one were in the A or higher range.  From these I eliminated Ekanuba first, which had a B rating.  Although it is what the breeder was feeding my puppy's litter, it appears to be average, at best, with some decent ingredients, but also containing by-products.<br /><br />Once I had established that the remaining contenders all ranked in the same range, I looked at price.  Now all of these will cost more than a store brand, but in the end your dog may end up healthier, which will make both him and you happier.<br /><br />Castor and Pollux ranked in the top 5 or so of the foods I looked at, and in the end it costs about $1.71 a pound using Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" program.  Plus it ends up shipped free to your home - which makes one less 15 pound item you need to lug home from grocery shopping!<br /><br />Now, this price is perhaps double a store brand, Alpo, or Purina, but those brands contain a lot of fillers and meat by-products, and you have no way of knowing what is in by-product.  Manufacturers are very good at fooling our eyes.  We read "Meat By-products" and we see "meat".  Yet at 85 cents a pound, you many no longer consider it a bargain when you realize "meat by-products" can include bones, blood, heads, lungs, intestines, ligaments, feet and feathers.  Not so yummy any more.<br /><br />The present ingredient list (all from the United States, by the way) for Castor & Pollux Natural Ultramix,  is as follows:<br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Turkey Meal, Milo, Ground Whole Oats, Ground Whole Barley, Dried Bananas, Chicken Fat (Naturally preserved with Mixed Tocopherols and Citric Acid), Brown Rice, Dried Peas, Natural Chicken Flavor, Salmon Meal, Tomato Pomace, Brewers Dried Yeast, Ground Whole Flaxseed, Dried Sweet Potatoes, Dried Carrots, Dried Egg Product, Potassium Chloride, Salt, Freeze Dried Peas, Dried Cranberries, Dicalcium Phosphate, Fructooligosaccharide, Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Sulfate, Vitamin E Supplement, Choline Chloride, Ferrous Sulfate, Niacin, Copper Sulfate, Thiamine Mononitrate, Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin A Supplement, Manganous Oxide, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Sodium Selenite, Riboflavin, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Calcium Iodate, Folic Acid, Rosemary Extract.<br /><br />It contains very good protein sources such as poultry and poultry meal, as well as salmon meal, and its grain content comes from oats and barley.  It also includes a good mix of dried vegetables and fruits.  The dried fruits are easily visible.  They are decent size pieces, not microscopic.<br /><br />At first glance, you might think these ingredients aren't all that different than a less expensive brand like Iams.  However, aside from the aforementioned meat by-products, another key thing to look at is whether a food contains corn, especially in the first few ingredients.  Iams and many others will often include corn, which isn't worthwhile to your puppy.  Typically they lack dried vegetables/fruits, which Casto & Pollux contains - so while other brands might seem less expensive (and are per pound) in the long run you are paying for fillers.<br /><br />All in all, I think Natural Ultramix is a high grade dog food, but not at such a high cost as to prohibit using it on a regular basis.  It is smaller size kibble to make it easier for puppies to chew, and it does not have an offensive aroma (either in the bowl or in the air, if you know what I mean).<br /><br />PS - for anyone wondering why I chose this brand over the others, once I was satisfied I had found a few very good brands, it really just came down to the price and shopping availability among them, while still having the ingredients I desired (including vegetables & fruit).  I can tell you I found Dick Van Patten's "Natural Balance" to be a sleeper in the bunch.  I assumed that if the company tied a celebrity name to it, the product probably couldn't stand on its own, but based on ingredients, that looks like a good puppy food as well.

review/summary: Very Good Dogfood
review/text: First my background as a dog owner. I have raised seven dogs. I have tended to more. The breeds include Labrador, Poodle, Schnoodle, Labradoodle, Akita, English Bulldog, Staffordshire Terrier, and Irish Setter. I have used Iams, Sams Club's Premium brand, Science Diet, Blue Mountain or whatever, lots of foods.<br /><br />This is a very good dog food. The dogs love it, the ingredients are top notch, and it's highly digestible which means less poop and hardly any of those soft diarrhea mounds that make my stomach roil when I have to attempt to scoop them up so my two year old doesn't get poop all over her feet.<br /><br />I would recommend this dog food over any other that I have tried. Excellent product.

review/text: I have two Havanese boys and the older one is the pickiest eater you will ever meet. My boys did well on Blue Buffalo but used to pick out the lifesource bits, leave them behind, and make a huge mess. As for Castor & Pollux Ultramix, they don't leave a single drop behind. They even clean up anything they dropped on the floor. I am very pleased with the quality of the food and even happier that they are getting nutritional goodies such as dried fruits. It is especially ideal for my older one who used to suffer allergic reactions and has a very sensitive stomach. Thanks Castor & Pollux!

review/summary: Top-notch dog food...
review/text: I have been researching dog food for our puppy for awhile.  The goal was to find something that was 1.) optimal for her health, most importantly and 2.) not so hard on our wallets.  After trying a few other foods, this one beat out the rest.  She loves it, it is made with top-quality ingredients, and we get a reasonable deal through Amazon with free shipping if you sign-up for a delivery schedule.  This was also the only place we found that sells bags larger than 5 Ibs.  BEST of all... no more horrible puppy gas!  She is part Boston Terrier, which can be known for flatuence... this food has completely done away with this problem.  You can check any dog food review site, Castor & Pollux gets top reviews.  Very pleased.  We will be sticking with this brand for quite some time to come!

review/summary: Excellent Food Source for Puppies
review/text: My small toy puppy loves the small heart shaped bite size.  This food does not have a lot of cheap fillers so her stools don't smell as bad, nor does she poop as often as with the other brands of foods.  She loves the small bite size bananas, raisins and carrots included in the meal.  I feed her one cup twice a day and she's growing fast.  Her coat is shiny and healthy looking too. Normally priced around $14-16 dollars at PETCO, I found it at Big Lots for $5 dollars with a six-month expiration date so the food was still good. I highly recommed it for small puppies.  They also have organic snacks and training treats.  I use them as well to keep her digestive system healthy and organic meal plan consistent.

review/summary: holistic puppy food
review/text: You are what you eat, this also applies to your pets too. If you are a healthy eating individual, do the same for your pet and give them healthy food that are good for their body.<br /><br />There are many choices of dog food out there, and about half of them are as healthy as your local fast food restaurants. Grocery brands (what you find at __mart and supermarkets) are the aforementioned. Castor & Pullux is NOT one of them.<br /><br />C & P makes great dog food that a dog's unique body chemistry needs and will actually be absorbed, not crappy filler ingredients that is just gonna slide through and out the other end. Dogs need protein and water mainly. They have little to no use for corn, starch, rice, or random blended animal parts and the likes. With C & P, you know exactly what your dog is eating. This puppy mix even comes with real fruit bits!<br /><br />Just remember, fillers will only make them full but is not what they need. The more fillers they eat, the more comes out the other end. You get what you pay for.

review/text: Our puppy loves this food and I love knowing we are feeding him wholesome, nutritious food.  We have gone organic for the most part in our own diet and it only makes sense to do this with our dog food.  The cost is reasonable (signed up for the monthly free delivery and saved extra $$!) It comes to our door at no cost.  The bites are small enough for smaller breeds and yet work well for larger breeds.  We have a black lab and his coat is shiny and healthy, he's filling out nicely and he's very well mannered.  I can see a difference in behavior when we feed our dogs healthy, non-gmo food, made from good products that aren't altered, dyed or filled with bad stuff that you find in typical off the shelf dog foods.

review/text: I switched my Cavalier spaniel puppies to Castor & Pollux when they started having allergies.  I had fed my cocker spaniel Iams lamb & rice formula but although she lived to almost 15, she was plagued by ear and digestive problems her entire life.  One of the new puppies had the pink tear staining and a lot of digestive issues and the other had ear problems.  I did a lot of research and wanted a product that contained no bi-products and had pro-biotics.  The pink tear staining went away immediately with C&P and I think it's worth the extra $ for that reason alone!  But even better: no more ear problems!!!  I'll soon be switching to the adult formula because the pups are 8 and 10 mos.  I really think this is a superior food at a reasonable cost thanks to Amazon.  Free shipping and an x-tra %15 off with auto-ship!

review/summary: Pug Loves it
review/text: Our 4 month old pug was having a very loose stool, which led me to start researching puppy food.  After stumbling across this Ultramix we decided to give it a shot.  First off our pug LOVED it, he eats the entire bowl, previously on puppy chow he wouldnt finish his meal.  Secondly, his stool firmed up almost instantly.  We will stay on this food until he is ready for the adult version.  Lastly his coat was getting course on the puppy chow, now it is soft and shiny again.  Very pleased with this product initially.<br /><br />Update 1 month later:<br />Stool went soft again after a few more days on the Ultramix. He also stopped eating as much, he will rarely finish a 1 cup bowl, sometimes leaves it for the next day.  We are now trying Merrick Puppy Plate at the recommendation of our vet.

review/summary: Definitely worth the money.
review/text: I was searching for a quality puppy food for my 10 month old Jack Russell puppy that I just recently accuired from a girl who was rehoming her.  She had her on Purina Puppy Chow.  I am not a fan of low end grocery store dog foods.  I find the money you "save" by buying cheap food, you eventually "spend" at the vet for the various problems that arise from feeding unnatural grain products.  That beind said, I began my search.<br /><br />My parents have three geriatric JRT's who are 16, 14 and 11 years old.  The oldest has severe arthritis and has been put on Blue Buffalo's Wilderness Grain Free Diet and is thriving.  The other two eat it as well.  I thought about trying the puppy version, but there is none.  So I delved a little further via internet reviews and found that this product came highly recommended.  I bought a 15lb bag at my local chain pet store, the price was competitive with other brands in the same quality category.  At first she wouldn't eat it.  Great... but I mixed it with some of the Purina (yuck) puppy chow to ease her into it.  Now she is fully on the Castor and Pollux and licks the bowl clean.  I used to free feed her, but she likes it so much I had to establish a feeding schedule to prevent over eating.  She especially likes the dried bananas and hunts for those first.<br /><br />Her stools are solid, small, predicatble and with little to no odor.  Bonus!  Her coat is shiny and healthy and her breath good.  All major pluses.<br /><br />A fifteen pound bag lasts her about a month and a half.  She is fifteen pounds.  So if you calculate the cost out, it's about .65 a day.  Very economical.  I would suggest a real meat suppliment on ocasion to round out nutrition.  A+++

review/summary: Excellent Food
review/text: I have used Castor and Pollux Organix for a number of years now.  Sometimes I switch, especially if I'm looking for a less expensive alternative, but I always find my way back to this dog food.  It is an excellent source of nutrition, though I also supplement with Standard Process formulas, Springtime garlic, and the Missing Link so that my crew gets all the nutrition they need for optimum immune support.<br /><br />I rescued an 11-week-old Welsh Corgi puppy recently - he came from a backyard breeder that didn't know what they were doing.  He was drastically underweight and his energy was frighteningly low.  Because the rescue person couldn't tell me what food the little guy was use to, I switched directly over to Castor and Pollux.  He also had a bad case of tape worm, which I found out after I brought him home, and adjusted poorly to the food at first.  So, I put him on Science Diet canned I.D.  - basically a pablum for dogs - just to get his system calmed down and then gradually added the Castor and Pollux - just a few pieces at first and working up from there while keeping an eye out for loose stool.  Anytime his stool became too loose, I backed off with the Castor and Pollux.  It's been a month and we're at a 75% to 25% ratio with Castor and Pollux at 75%.  He is MUCH healthier and looks like a completely different dog.<br /><br />Castor and Pollux doesn't contain the same kinds of processed foods - or at least not to the same extent - as other dog foods, even so-called natural dog foods, so it's harder to digest.  This isn't a bad thing - it's a lot like eating take out all the time and then sitting down to home-cooked brown rice and pinto beans! ;-)  Even if introduced slowly, not every dog will adjust well, but that depends more upon food allergies than anything wrong with the food itself.  I have fed at least 8 dogs this brand of food, and one of them just can't tolerate it for long, but she's allergic to chicken, so of course she has digestive issues with the food.  By and large, however, this is an excellent food - just introduce it slowly so your pup eases into it.<br /><br />On a side note - no dry dog food can give your dog everything that he/she needs nutritionally, so it's likely you'll need to supplement with something like The Missing Link or another whole food supplement.

review/summary: Puppy loved it!
review/text: I just got a new red standard poodle puppy yesterday.  He's 10 weeks old.  We named him "Mr. Mojo Risin".  I bought the Castor & Pollux before he arrived and before I found out from the breeder (via the papers attached to the kennel he flew in) that he was eating Eukanuba puppy food.  There was also a small baggie of Eukanuba attached to his kennel.  So, I immediately ordered some Eukanuba from Amazon for overnight delivery, which should be here later today.  (Mr. Mojo ate all of the Eukanuba in 20 hours.)  I knew he was hungry and gave him a little of this food.  He loved it and gobbled it down very fast!  He'd eaten the Eukanuba but not nearly as fast as he ate the Castor & Pollux.  He ate it so fast that he threw up!  So, I've tapered him down and will mix both brands (when the Eukanuba finally arrives) until he's 100% on this new dog food.  Mr. Mojo Risin highly recommends this brand of puppy food!

review/summary: Fussy Puppy!
review/text: This food seems fine.  I only gave it a four star because my puppy didn't want to eat it.  This does not mean in any way it is not a good or tasty food.  I have been through several foods that were highly recommended only to find my puppy wouldn't like them.  I have found a food he likes and so I have mixed the two to finish up this bag.  His new food is Merrick Puppy Plate.  This one comes freeze dried and you are supposed to add water to make a gravy.  I find my pup likes it better without the gravy!  I still would highly recommend Castor & Pollux puppy food.  I later found out that the original owner of my pup was feeding him adult food.  That may be why he had a hard time getting used to puppy food.

review/text: We have a pair of boxers and decided to give these a shot.  While they are 6" - 7" in length, as advertised, they are much skinnier than the chews we get in the pet stores, and not much of a bargain to justify the difference.  So, no false advertising, but caveat emptor.

review/summary: Sugar, lots. Maple, not so much
review/text: The problem with this peanut butter is the use of "evaporated cane juice" which is a coy way of saying "raw sugar". Accent--on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the "cane juice" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.<br /><br />I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes. I gave it two stars--if you are making a confection or cookies, it could be very good, but as eat-alone peanut butter, I found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes.

review/summary: Ok but not great
review/text: These tuna pouches are just the right amount of premade salad for a sandwich, which is very convenient.  Being stable and having a decent shelf-life is also nice.  However, I suggest you check the ingredient list of all the premade tuna salads and make sure you like what is in them.  I personally was not a fan of the water chestnuts in the mix...and there are quite a few of them.  I didn't like the taste, but I can't give them a one star review because they are very handy...I just wish they had a version that was a little simpler and didn't have relish or water chestnuts.

review/summary: This sauce is a bomb, for sure.
review/text: I'm a fan of spice. It's almost a problem, in that I put hot sauce and/or seasoning on almost everything I eat lately. It's not uncommon for me to have a mean sweat going on while I eat. Yeah, some people would probably find that weird or even crazy... but for me, I enjoy it. I love spicy food.<br /><br />Which brings me to the review. I bought this 4 pack of Da Bomb ghost pepper sauce looking for a kick similar to what I experienced with the Dave's Gourmet Ghost Pepper sauce. But it's not. It's nowhere near the intensity as the Dave's sauce. In fact, Da Bomb's sauce is mostly habanero based, according to the ingredients. Habanero usually has a kick, but this sauce is no spicier than the habanero hot sauce I can get for a buck per bottle at my local grocer. I feel like I basically paid a premium for a sauce because they call it "ghost pepper", even though it has ghost pepper listed as the last ingredient in the list. Lame.<br /><br />Taste wise, it's ok. Spice wise, it's mild for me... particularly when compared to competing brands. With Dave's, I'd put a couple of drops on my food and the level of heat was fantastic. With Da Bomb, I'm dumping this stuff on my food and adding some habanero powder on top to give me my fix.<br /><br />Bottom line -- if you're looking for a really tasty, spicy hot sauce, this probably isn't for you. If you're serious about spice, try the Dave's Gourmet sauce. Amazon doesn't always carry it, but it's worth hunting down. Just don't waste your time with this.

review/summary: Don't put too much on
review/text: I thought it'd be a great idea to get this since it's better than paying a bunch for a single bottle online. I also assumed quantity equals quality...<br /><br />GOOD: doesn't override taste of the food you put it in (in moderate amounts), very spicy<br /><br />BAD: smells bad and tastes bad in large quantities (you may like it though, but I "tolerate" it), doesn't give that nice hot-sauce body glow (for me, anyways), more likely to cause a stomachache<br /><br />Overall, try other hot sauces at your local store before this. And don't expect it to taste good if you pile it on.<br /><br />I edited this review from a 3-star to a 4-star because I discovered that this doesn't taste bad or give you a stomachache if you DON'T PUT TOO MUCH ON. Seriously, it's pretty good stuff in moderation.

review/text: The sauce itself is good. Nice and spicy. However, it is UPS that smashed the box up so bad the top of it was starting to come off, the corner was "accordioned", and one of the bottles inside had it's cap cracked. The safety seal kept it together so it didn't leak, which is lucky for the incompetent fool who "handled" the package. But now I'm left with a bottle of extremely hot sauce that once opened, I cannot close.

review/text: Thank you, Dr Oz, for recommending the Lingonberry as a super antioxidant, as well as a diet aide!  I completely get it --  when you eat the lingonberry, your taste buds are immediately blasted into nonexistence by these mini-Sour Bombs, thereby making every other food tasteless and less enjoyable!  Voila... Diet!<br /><br />To describe the flavor, I can only say that when I tossed about 10 of these little babies into my mouth and chewed, I was almost launched through the roof and my face instantly went numb.<br /><br />My daughter, however, thought they were pretty delicious and ate them up.  I was glad that she liked them; they are pretty expensive.  I recommend these to anyone who really likes sour flavors.

review/summary: My dog loves these - they help his teeth stay clean
review/text: I originally started my dog with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WBZ47C">Paragon Hedgehogs</a> - made of the same substance at the toothbrushes, but in a larger form factor - when he was a teething puppy about a year ago.  At that time, he was really slow to finish an entire Hedgehog, but once his adult teeth came in, the thing would be gone in a day and that was way too much dental chew to be ingesting at a time.  Now we give him one toothbrush a day after dinner.  He'll spend half an hour looking for the perfect hiding spot for it and then give in and eat it.  He loves these "toothbrushes" and gets so excited when we give one to him.<br /><br />These treats are made from vegetable starch and have a mild smell like potatoes.  They are currently made in Holland.<br /><br />The "toothbrushes" come in a few sizes. Our pup is 15lbs and we give him the "toothbrushes" from the "small 28ct" bag.<br /><br />The one issue I have with these chews is that they contain titanium dioxide (for coloring) which some studies show is toxic in large quantities.  I'd prefer if they left this ingredient out but unfortunately I've found that nearly every dog chew has something questionable in it.

review/text: Our three dogs love these chews, which we alternate with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CE9I9S">Sam's Yams Big Boyz Sweet Potato Dog Treats, 1-Pound Bag</a>. A daily dose of these chew treats seems to minimize the tartar buildup. We usually feed this medium size to our two 50 pound-ish dogs and the large size to our 65-lb Aussie/Chow mix. We appreciate the all veg, highly digestible ingredients and great chewing action (they're good and chewy, but not hard enough a dog might break a tooth on them), and the fact they're made in Holland, while our dogs seem to appreciate the flavor and gum-massaging action. Be sure to have plenty of fresh water available for your dog, as ours always enjoy a good long drink after finishing their chew treats.<br /><br />This product comes in a variety of sizes, and the sizing information isn't always clear. The "product dimensions" given here describe the size of the PACKAGING, not the product. For clarification, these Paragon medium-sized Star Toothbrushes measure 4" long and 1 1/8th" wide at their widest point (the base of the "handle,") while the large size are 5 1/2" long and 1 1/2" wide at their widest point. I hope that's helpful.

Darker than Millstone's "Breakfast Blend" and FAR more flavorful, it's not so dark that it's bitter (by ANY means).  Rather, it is very smooth and YUMMY.  I know coffee tastes are very much a personal choice but we sure do recommend you give this a try.
