review/text: For some reason the pastel flavoring really yummy with the mints.  I like it especially because the outside is really thick unlike the regular junior mints which only have a thin chocolate layer.  I wish this wasn't seasonal.<br /><br /> And don't buy this for $10.  That is a huge ripoff. I found another site selling these, where I got 5 boxes for $10 - still expensive but not as much.

review/summary: You'll love Mrs. May's Trio bars.  Gluten & dairy free.
review/text: Mrs. May's Trio bars are my favorite snack/energy bars.  I love them.  They come in four flavors.  Cranberry is not my favorite of those flavors, but I still really like it, just not as much as blueberry and strawberry.  Though cranberries are pretty tart, the cranberry bar is not noticeably tarter than the others.  It does seem less sweet to me than the blueberry and strawberry ones, but the carbs and sugars are the same so it may be my imagination.<br /><br />The name comes from the ingredients.  The bars have a trio of trios:  3 nuts, 3 seeds and 3 fruits.  The nuts, seeds and 2 of the fruits are the same in all the flavors.  The nuts are cashews, almonds & pistachios.  The seeds are sesame, pumpkin, & sunflower.  The two fruits that are in all the flavors are dates and raisins, but you don't really see or taste them so I wonder if they are cooked down into the "glue" that holds all the other ingredients together.  The third fruit in the cranberry flavor is dried cranberry.  The only other ingredients are rice malt, natural flavors, cane juice and sea salt.<br /><br />These are great bars for anyone who has issues with wheat or dairy.  The label says they are wheat free, gluten free, dairy free and kosher.  They also have no preservatives.  If you have peanut allergies, the label says they are packaged in a peanut free facility that processes other nuts.<br /><br />Because of the nuts, they have 12 grams of fat per bar, but I've been reading articles that say nuts are a great snack and the fat in nuts is "good" fat.  The label says there is 1.5 grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated.  To round out the rest of the nutrition facts:  calories, 170; total carbs, 14g; dietary fiber, 2g; sugars, 6g; protein, 5g; cholesterol, 0g; trans fat, 0g; and sodium, 45mg.<br /><br />I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don't have the mealy texture that a lot of energy/snack bars have.  They are low sodium but high in taste and they are really satisfying.  I used to get granola bars but these are so much better.

review/summary: Very Good!
review/text: We like these Mrs. May's Trio Natural Bars. These are a little on the chewy, sticky side, so beware, if you have dental problems (chew carefully). Packaged in an almost indestructible cello package. The ingredients are as follows: Cashews, Almonds, Pistachios, Cranberries, Sesame Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds, Dates, Raisins, Rice Malt, Natural Flavors, Cane Juice, Sea Salt. That's it! There are 24 bars in a 28.8 oz or 840 gram box. Each bar is 1.2 oz or 35 grams. The box says: vegan/no trans fat/no additives/no preservatives/no cholesterol/gluten free/diary free/wheat free/non-GMO/kosher and product of China (that worries me more than a little). Calories 170 each, 100 calories from fat, 12 grams total fat, 1.5 grams saturated fat, 0mg cholesterol, 45mg sodium, 14g total carbohydrate, 2g dietary fiber, 6g sugar, 5g protein, 4% calcium, 8% iron, 0% vitamins A & C. Yummy flavor, can taste the nuts and cranberries, not too sweet for most people, certainly a lot less sweet than any other granola/snack/breakfast/protein type bar we've tried. Wish they were bigger, pretty small. Otherwise, very good bars.

review/summary: Not the best quality
review/text: My family drinks a lot of coconut milk (about a can a day) and we have tried almost every brand out there.  This one tastes OK, but contains more preservatives than any other we have tried.  Unfortunately the ingredients are not listed here so I wasn't able to find that out until after my case arrived.<br /><br />For the price this Roland brand isn't a bad deal but I would recommend Chaokoh or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVIEG">Natural Value Coconut Milk, 14-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a> over this one.  Natural Value has no fillers or preservatives and tastes great which means it is perfect for making healthy coconut yogurt with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SUHY">Salton YM9 1-Quart Yogurt Maker</a>.  If you haven't tried making coconut yogurt yet I highly recommend it!<br /><br />A lot of people are still under the impression that Coconut milk is bad for you.  There was some faulty research done years ago on hydrogenated coconut oil which is mostly to blame for this.  If you are one of those people that still think coconut is bad I recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416569502">The Good Fat Cookbook</a> to help set the record straight.

review/summary: In spite of.....
review/text: In spite of the fact that there are some ten syllable words in along with this coconut milk, and in spite of the fact that one can equals 650 calories(!), it is the least expensive way to go for coconut milk, if you have Amazon Prime. The application I plan to use it for mostly is some ice cream. I've only made one batch so far, but I feel like I've died and went to heaven after eating the Strawberry/Vanilla/Coconut ice cream I made with this stuff yesterday, and I probably will die and hopefully go to heaven because there must be at least a million calories per serving, but what do they say about everything in moderation:~) I just substituted the coconut milk for the regular milk called for in the recipe and let me tell you......THIS IS THE RICHEST AND CREAMIEST ICE CREAM I'VE EVER TRIED!, it is sooooo silky, not a trace of ice crystals to be found anywhere, and the coconut flavor does come through. For a once in a while indulgence, use your favorite Vanilla ice cream recipe and use this stuff instead of the regular milk and....... knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door........ I also plan on baking up some Coconut Milk bread here shortly, will get back with comments when I do.<br /><br />P.S. At least half of the 24 cans came dented, so much so, that I dare not even chance using them, but I went to fill out an exchange form and found a link where I could get live  phone help with this problem. I filled in my phone number, I clicked the link, and I swear to god, I got a return call in under 10 seconds!!! And..... they are sending replacement cans by two day UPS, what great service!

review/summary: good product at good price
review/text: I'm a baker and I use this brand of coconut milk all the time.  I like it as much as the more expensive Chaokoh brand.  Coconut milk prices have been rising over the past couple of years, and this is one of the best prices I have found.  My only issue with my experience ordering it from Amazon was that my case of cans seemed to have been sitting around in a warehouse for quite some time--all the milk was completely separated, leaving a thick pasty mass at the bottom of each can and a translucent water.  Shaking the cans was impossible; I had to open up the cans, scrape out the contents and do my best to whisk it all back together (which works for the most part, but it's impossible to get it completely lump-free). I realize coconut milk needs to be shaken before use, but I've never experienced settling to this degree. Looks like Amazon probably doesn't have a huge turnover rate for this product, so the cases sit around too long and the milk separates. For this reason I deduct one star.  Otherwise this is a good product at a decent price.

review/text: Given that I'm allergic to cow's milk, almond milk, rice milk AND soy, I was deliriously happy to find this product at a local warehouse store.  That is when I learned to use it as coffee creamer, to make wonderful mashed potatoes and a divine whipped cream substitute. (Any day now I'm going to make the ice cream.)  When the warehouse store ran out, I had to ration mine until I found that Amazon (amazing me yet again) had it on its subscription plan and I signed up pronto.<br /><br />Yes, lots of additives, but won't break the bank.  One thing at a time... I'm also paying for a pantry full of gluten free baking products (which at Amazon's bulk + subscription prices makes it relatively easy).<br /><br />PS: Amazon sent me the wrong product with my first shipment, I received the low fat version of this item.  I connected with them via Chat, and two days later I received the correct product.  I wish I could do all my grocery shopping this way.

review/summary: My Favorite Tea
review/text: We are a family of huge tea lovers, which is why we always select our teas very carefully. This summer, I walked into a Kusmi store in Montreal and was presented by a small glass of iced tea by the store assistant. The tea tasted heavenly. It was like nothing I'd ever tried before. Of course, I immediately bought a tin of this loose-leafed tea, even though it was quite pricey.<br /><br />I realize that any tea tastes divine when taken iced in a sweltering heat, so I wasn't sure that my initial impression of Kusmi Imperial Label would persist after trying the tea several times. However, we've been now drinking it for several months and we still adore it. The tea has some licorice added to eat, so it has a sweetish taste. There is no need to add any sugar or sweetener to it. The tea's fragrance alone makes it worth buying.<br /><br />I researched several different outlets where this tea could be bought and discovered that, in terms of price and speed of delivery, Amazon is the best place. The only problem with this tea is that it's so good that we go through a 4.4oz tin very fast. This is why Amazon's lower price for this tea is attractive.

review/summary: Great Flavor
review/text: I've resisted bouillon cubes in the past but my repertoire was lacking.  This is the answer.  The flavor of this boullon is amazing and you don't need a lot. Low sodium to boot. It helps out on all the oldies but goodies:  Chicken and dumplings, split pea soup, chicken rice.  It's so much better than organic broth.  Organic broth is so watery, might as well make it myself.  I highly recommend this bouillon.

review/summary: Best Chicken Base....
review/text: Loved Better Than Bouillon Organic Chicken Base - however, needed to use the low sodium version and it is sometimes hard to locate in local stores - so I purchased on line.  I started using the regular version several years ago and with high sodium content I was glad to find the reduced sodium version.  It is an excellent base for anything needing chicken bouillon - especially any type of chicken soup including chicken & noodles.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Outstanding but should be less expensive
review/text: I got my first jar of it for four bucks at the local Price Chopper. Yes, 16 ounces. It is a very superior product. Just had a cup of chicken bouillon made with it - nothing else would do as I am nursing a cold. Ya know, CHICKEN SOUP! I also use it to flavor rice. It says reduced sodium but is still plenty salty, frankly. When I add it to rice cooking water, I don't use additional salt. Learned that the hard way. And I am a salt lover. Can't imagine how salty the regular version must be.<br /><br />The stuff is viscous, gooey even but dissolves fairly readily in water I've preheated in the microwave. Had to stir for a minute, maybe. Absolutely delicious, just what the doctor ordered. *smacks lips, feeling much better*

review/summary: Organic and Delicious!
review/text: When I was being offered a sample cup of this stock @ Costco I was weirded out by how they just offered the cooked stock by itself in a cup but I tried it anyways because of the wonderful aroma it gave off and I was astounded by how good it tasted! So I bought it, of course. When I got home with it I immediately used it for this vegetable soup I had in mind even though I was a bit skeptical about whether it'd go well with my recipe but even if it didn't, it's organic so nothing can beat that right? Turns out the soup tasted GREAT! Everyone loved my soup. Now, I rarely use bouillon/stock because I feel that it's very unhealthy with all the additives in it but having some in stock really helps when you're feeling lazy and don't want to go out to grocery shop just for some stock. Overall, I'm very pleased with this and will buy more in the future!

I use this together with organic chicken broth, organic veggies and organic chicken to make a yummy homemade chicken veggie soup that is really good and much better for me than store brands loaded with MSG preservatives and coloring. Better Than Bouillon (Reduced Sodium) really is Better!

review/text: These Chef Boyardee Mini Raviolis from Amazon are the same price I pay at Wal Mart - about 88 cents a can - and its the kids fave, so having a case on hand is excellent! Each ravioli is bite size and just right for little kids who still like to eat with a SPOON. They are a little bigger than "spoon size" shredded wheat, but still small enough to fit a spoon. Not high in fat or calories, they make a nice hot emergency meal for adults, too! FYI: These contain SOY (TVP) if you need to know that. Enjoy!

I like mini better because it's easier to eat and less meaty for those who don't want too much meat, and the sauce is great for dipping a piece of bread in. Due to its high sodium/processed content, this is not something I eat on a regular basis, but it is fun to treat myself every now and then to this delicious ravioli. Yum!

Either they need to be more discriminant in their product selection, or they need more careful shipping and handling.

review/summary: disappointing truffle
review/text: This is the second brand of canned or bottled truffles. Firstly, what type of gadget gets this can to open? I had to use an old fashioned beer can opener which left me with the problem of fishing out the little truffles through a jagged opening. When I finally succeeded, chopped the truffles, and put my nose close to them, there was hardly any aroma. After adding them to the risotto I was making, there still was not much truffle perfume. This is a better quality truffle than the previous brand I'd bought. You actually could get that almost garlic like undertone to the truffle.<br />I've pretty much decided that for a home cook, truffle infused oil of good quality is the way to go. You don't get the full spectrum of the truffle aroma, but what's there is quite intense.

Very simple and pure ingredients give it a very clean taste with a wonderful texture.<br /><br />I highly recommend it!

Upon ordering these, I had a tin right after I received them.  The price is right - the other varieties I was buying were slightly more expensive and usually there were few in stock at the store - maybe 1-4 cans only.  The Bar Harbor herring is great - no canola oil, tin is easy to open, and the fish is just the right texture and taste - not too smoky, not too overpowering.  These are great and I'll definitely be reordering!

Just as important, these little lifesavers--unlike tuna--are at the bottom of the fishy food chain, meaning that they have much lower mercury levels than well, tuna. I've been eating herring for years and Bar Harbor's taste like they just came out of the sea. Okay, that's not true but they do taste much better than every other canned fish I've tried.

review/text: Lately I have been indulging in canned fish, like the Angelo Parodi skinless and boneless sardines (which I like a lot). I've always like pickled herring, so I decided to give some canned herring a chance. I tried the Bar Harbor wild herring with cracked pepper, which is pretty good and has a slightly smoky flavor. But these natural smoked wild kippers beat the pants off that. They are incredibly satisfying to eat. I like how you don't have to do anything to them. They aren't packed in oil, like someone said, but herring is an oily fish. Maybe if you are used to eating those kippers that look like they are nicotine stained, these kippers will be bland. To me, they have a just-right amount of smoking. Also, they are not mushy but they are not stiff either, like a good sardine. I will be buying a lot more of these in the future, I can tell you that.

review/summary: Mushy, barely smoked and underseasoned
review/text: I love smoked canned fish.<br /><br />I eat kippered snacks and sardines quite regularly. I was pretty excited when I saw these kippers for sale. I promptly ordered a dozen cans because I was attracted to the high quality packaging and the eco friendly lingo on the cover.<br /><br />The interior of the can leaves much to be desired. The fish seams to be over cooked and falling apart. The flavor is pleasant but was greatly aided by a couple of turns of my sea salt mill. The smoke flavor is very mild and not at all what I expect from a kippered snack. The smoke flavor is there but not nearly as strong as I would desire.<br /><br />In all honesty I prefer the $1.00 cans of Brunswick kippered seafood snack I pick up at my local Big Lots. They are firm, smokey and correctly seasoned.  For a truly divine kipper experience I would recommend trying the Appel brand of kippers available here on Amazon.

review/summary: These did not disappoint.
review/text: I first ate sardines as a kid. My Dad had them all the time - snacks while watching football, Friday nights when his friends were over for poker. They were a staple on our family camping trips. I liked them then and I like them now although until recently I didn't eat them as much as I used to. I keep a can or two in the pantry and enjoy them now and then. Recently, I went to a gourmet food store and found Bar Harbor All Natural Smokes Wild Kippers. They were on sale so I bought a couple of cans. UNFREAKING BELIEVABLE! Comparing these to the regular sardines I grew up with is like comparing a 10 year old Kia to a brand new Lexus. The Bar Harbors are absolutely delicious! I just served these as an appetizer to some friends I had over for a BBQ. I opened a few cans and put the fish in the middle of a serving plate and surrounded it with a variety of crackers. My guests thought this was some kind of expensive imported smoked fish, they loved it and it disappeared quickly. If you have ever had sardines and enjoyed them then you will be extremely happy with these. It is hard to get over to that little gourmet grocery all the time, so I am very very very happy that I can order these on Amazon - and at a great price. Yes, Amazon's price is less than I pay at the gourmet store.

review/summary: Mushy like oatmeal!
review/text: After reading all the reviews I was really looking forward to getting these.  The arrived and I excitedly opened a can.  The texture was soft and the fish fell apart at the slightest touch. I could barely pick it up with a fork as it broke into a million little mushy pieces every time I touched it.  I thought it must be a fluke- an odd can that was abnormal.  Every can I have opened is the same.  The flavor is fine but the texture is totally off-putting.  I'll not buy any more.<br /><br />B. G.

review/summary: tasty, but..
review/text: These were truly a joy to eat, extremely tasty, something you actually enjoy eating as opposed to sardines which just aren't so delicious.<br /><br />That said, I didn't notice how much salt is in them until after I finished eating. There are 3.5 servings in the 6.7oz can and 280mg of salt per serving (listed as 10% of daily value, for just one serving... I ate almost the whole can, but I was hungry and they were tasty...) I wouldn't care so much, but it's not sea salt. (and even if it was, that's probably more salt than necessary) It's probably iodized sodium chloride (table salt), heavily processed and chemically stripped of all minerals.<br /><br />I allow canned fish in my diet because it is a good way to get omega 3's, especially while traveling or camping, but I am not so comfortable with the fact that the fish, while in the can, is brought to such high temperatures that it is considered sterile. Omega 3 fats are delicate, better to eat fish high in omega 3's raw, fermented, lightly seared, etc. Also concerned about leaching of the metal can. I only buy in water because I don't want to eat olive oil that has been so highly heated. It would be full of oxidized fat, but then again, maybe so is the fish after being canned. I am not so concerned with getting BPA free cans - They may take the BPA out and put in something just as bad or worse... a different bisphenol. I read someone saying the BPA was actually what kept the metals from leaching into the food. I think it was just their speculation based on tasting a metallic taste in a bpa free canned food, but it seems to me that could be the case.<br /><br />so what's worse, possible metals, bisphenol, and oxidized fats? or do the boost of omega 3 fats and protein, convenience, low cost, and lowest mercury content of any other fish outweigh these issues? (pcbs, dioxins are another matter and their levels depend where the fish come from) You must consider how much bisphenol, leaching metals, and oxidized fats you are getting in your diet already, and decide for yourself. You may want to get rid of all the other possible sources of these things and just allow yourself canned fish every once in a while.<br /><br />Ideally I would like to see on the can where the fish comes from and whether it is sustainably harvested. I also prefer spring water and sea salt or no salt.<br /><br />The wood smoking is another point of contention, because it forms carcinogenic compounds. However, wood smoking was done traditionally in healthy cultures, and is nowhere near as bad as charcoal smoking. Plus, it's really tasty.<br /><br />If you like canned fish for the low cost and also the health benefits, you might also buy a non oily fish head for very cheap and make fish stock which is extremely nourishing.<br /><br />I think I will stick to herring because it is so much more delicious than sardines. I can also buy wood smoked herring packaged in plastic in the refrigerated section for very low cost. It has regular old table salt :(, but I will give that a try too. Since it isn't canned I feel better about it.<br /><br />Didn't mean to give a lecture but there I went. As you can tell I've done a bit of thinking and research on this and maybe someone else can benefit from it.<br /><br />I think Crown Prince makes kipper snacks without salt so I will have to try those next.

review/text: I usually buy Trader Joe's smoked kipper snacks and really like their uber smokiness. These don't have the same density of smoke flavor, but they are packed in water instead of the heavier oil that TJ's uses and it gives them a more delicate demeanor. They are still tough enough to stand up to most people's rigorous "fork test". I am trying a different brand this next purchase, but I wouldn't hesitate to come back to these. Bonus points for a cardboard wrapper. Isn't it about time we ban plastic wrappers for goods that don't require the added freshness??

review/text: I've eaten a lot of fish. I've eaten raw, cooked, smoked, canned, & many other types. I've tried all kinds of herring, canned, & this is one of the best & for the price, it's even better. We do lots of mixed salads with great California Oil/Vinegar w/fresh baked bread w/them. A nice white wine also. Don't forget the wine. One other thing, they won't be around forever. One good thing about canned fish is that they keep well for years if stored right. One in Alaska.

review/summary: greasy, oily and mushy
review/text: I grew up in Britain, where kippers - smoked herrings - were a common breakfast food.  Wishing to make kedgeree, a anglo-indian dish featuring smoked fish, including kippers, I shopped around and, based on the Amazon reviews, bought this product.  The fish that I received may have been smoked but they were then packed in oil to reverse the effect of smoking.  The result is an overly-priced version of sardines in oil.  This product is a travesty of the art of producing smoked fish, particularly kippers. That said, please buy this product if you like relatively tasteless, oily cans of dubious fish.

review/summary: They're fine, but not a quantum leap from what I can get in a supermarket.
review/text: Kippers are really fishy fish that are great if you love fish but can cause others (like wives) to run screaming out of the house.  I purchased these due to the other reviews, and because at the time the price for 12 6.7 oz cans compared very well to the price of 24 3 oz little cans at my local supermarket.<br /><br />However, the overall kipper experience wasn't really much different from the stuff I bought off the store shelves locally.  What I got what just what I expected, a can of soggy fishy tasting fish that gives me a lot of protien and if served with the right bread or cracker and some spreadable chive and onion cheese is quite a healthy snack if I'm hungry enough to want to eat it.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the pull tabs break off really easy on these, so even though you can't wait to dive into these cans of kippers, take it slow when you open them or you'll be digging around for your can opener.

They probably could be better for me, but with such savory flavors, it was easy to eat just a handful and not overdo it. Par-tay in my mouth. The shipping was great and fast as per usual (yay Amazon!), the boxes were new not dated or anywhere near expiring, they was no cracker breakage due to shipping, and it was all that I ever dreamed of in taste.

Now, it's an 'old reliable'. I keep wondering which of these flavors would be best crumbled in the food processor, or blender to be used in meatballs, or meatloaf. Cheez-Its, made into crumbs, would be good on baked, or fried chicken, or fish, or on top of your favorite casserole dish. Really, try these, they're delicious.

review/text: If you're a fan of original, regular ol' zits (Cheez-its) these are not for you.<br /><br />The Parmesan zits are disgusting, coated with a moist, powdery, overwhelming, sour-ish flavor mess. Tastes nothing like cheese - or cheez, for that matter. Look at the picture on the box, there's little green specs of herb, like oregano or something. That's not on the crackers at all but they mixed in some fake oregano flavor with the nasty flavor powder. Original zits have flavor baked inside - not dusted on after the fact. This horrendous flavor also works its way onto the sharp cheddar zits, ruining them.<br /><br />My dog eats anything and she refuses the parmesan zits. I do, too. I'll never make this mistake again. Try 'em - you'll see.<br /><br />Gross!

review/summary: Mixed flavors not terribly appealing
review/text: While both of the flavors (sharp cheddar & parmesan) are individually savory, the combined flavors were not great.  The first box I opened had a great number of broken and crumbled crackers, which resulted in the flavorings melding together.  In addition, the crackers had much more moisture than expected.  This moisture allowed the flavorings to mix further.<br /><br />The other three boxes were better - crisper and not as many broken crackers.  This allowed me to separate the crackers by flavor, which sort of defeated the "Duoz" concept.<br /><br />I had higher expectations and definitely would not have these again.

I received my order mid-December.<br /><br />The ones on the shelves at Vons expire September 2011.  This has nothing to do with Amazon being tricky, I assume the online snack ordering just hasn't quite caught on enough for inventory to clear as quickly as in B&M stores.<br /><br />As for the Duoz product, I'm going to order straight parmesan next time since I every time I get a sharp cheddar I think to myself, "Damn! I wish it were parmesan."<br /><br />But you know what they say...sometimes you need to pair a pretty with an ugly to appreciate the former more.

I am only bothering to post this because I was looking to get a deal by buying online, but I found they are more expensive here. I bought them at B.J.'s wholesalers for, I think, $5.89 a box. The only difference that I can tell is that the ones on line have 20 packs per box, and the ones from B.J.'s only contain 15 packs--but still you can get THREE boxes of 15 for less than $2 more than they are asking here for one box of 20.

review/text: I usually am not a fan of biscotti, it is usually so dry there isn't much taste.  These are fabulous.  Even though they are extremely thin, they do not shatter when you bite into them, and the pistachio flavor is fresh, the other flavorings are subtle but really tasty, and I think there is just the right level of sweetness.  The individual packets make it easy to carry around in a pocket, and with a piece of fruit this is a great midday snack!  Others have mentioned in their reviews that it is cheaper elsewhere, but I don't think it is fair to give this 1 or 2 stars only because of price because if people are searching based on reviews, this comes up very low on the list.  Unless they read the individual reviews they might not realize the rating had nothing to do with taste.  So I agree with the reviewer who still gave high stars and then mentioned the price issue in the review itself.  BTW, on the company website it is only cheaper if you are willing to buy a case, which costs $35, plus shipping.  They are indeed cheaper at COSTCO but I don't have a membership plus would have to drive about 45 min to get to one.  I'd have to start by purchasing a COSTCO membership, so in the end that isn't cheaper for me.  I am really glad I can get this on Amazon (I have Amazon Prime, so there is free shipping) to get an occasional box to tide me over while I wait for friends to pick some up to me on their next COSTCO run.  These really are hard to resist, good that they are packaged in 100 calorie portions but very easy to eat more than one!

I can not comment on this seller, but I am sure it is just as delicious as it is from the grocery store as it holds up very well.

review/summary: Really nice mild snacking cheese
review/text: This is a nice, mild but still flavorful cheese.  It's not a hard cheese but not exactly soft either; you can slice it, but it softens up a bit as it comes to room temperature.  Very pleasant texture.<br /><br />I think the flavor would go well with many things; so far I've had it just with flat rye bread, which tastes like a match made in Heaven.<br /><br />I also was very happy with the company's service.  The order shipped amazingly fast, was extremely well packaged in a cooler with ice packs, and the products were all fresh and chilled upon arrival.  The shipping cost was very reasonable too, especially considering the good pricing of the company's cheeses, and the high quality of the packaging materials used.  (Note that the per-cheese shipping cost which you see on the Amazon website can be a little confusing.  If you order several cheeses, like one probably would, the overall shipping is going to balance out.  For example, I ordered about six different cheeses from the same company, so the combined total shipping was only about $9; it's not $5-$6 per each cheese; I think that would only happen if you only ordered one cheese at a time.  Also, the Styrofoam cooler and many Cold-Packs they included in the packaging are something I can keep and re-use, so one gets more value for the shipping cost.)
