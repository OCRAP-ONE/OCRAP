review/text: The fragrance helps not make the garbage can  a little more bearable. But I wish that they were a tad bit thicker so you did not have to feel the warmth and gooeyness of the dogs shit when you picked it up. Always makes me squirm a little.

review/summary: LOVE These!
review/text: I LOVE these bags. Price and quality DOES matter when it comes to some products! I actually use these for my kitty litter box, and had bought some really cheap ones at the grocery store. They were tiny and really thin. I ordered these and they were great. They were a lot longer and thicker, and the fact that they are scented is a plus :) They're a little pricey, but I think they're worth it. And I NEVER smell anything when I throw the bags in the garbage. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Great for several uses!
review/text: I've been overpaying for the last year at Walmart and Target for the Arm & Hammer scented baggies until I found these online.  When they arrived, the first thing I did was smell them.  It sounds crazy, but the scents are really nice for drowning out other smells!  These are a nice fresh scent and not overwhelming.  I primarily use these at our changing table in my daughter's nursery.  I also keep a roll in each diaper bag, in the glove box of both vehicles, and in my purse.  Nasty diapers are the first thing to find their way into one of these, but I've used them for garbage in the car too.  Will be a return customer for sure!  They're perfect!

review/summary: Fabulous
review/text: Small apt, one jumbo litter box and 2 healthy litter box donors keep me scooping a few times a day. We all prefer a clean box. One meows and comes to tell me if someone (usually his furry buddy) pooped so I can clean up for the next occupant.<br /><br />I purchased a litter locker, great product but unnecessary. The refills are $5 each and barely lasted a week, so I was spending about $15-20 a month to toss cat poop. No thanks. I read a note in one review on the litter locker about diaper genie fitting and a better buy and thought if they make a roll of bags that hides a dirty diaper stink, that's exactly what we need. I bought a small plastic holder for diaper bags, it hangs in the bathroom and I use these very nicely scented bags that fit into the diaper bag dispenser. 100x times cheaper and since I toss garbage every 2 days, this is most economical, the bags are biodegradable and do just as advertised, contain odors and dont leak etc.

review/summary: Thumbs up from a dog walker!
review/text: I work as a dog walker for a petsitting company.  One of my clients keeps her leashes in the downstairs closet-- it has the most amazing smell and I could not figure out what it was!  I assumed it was some sort of air freshener.  One day, I saw one of these bags peeking out and took a whiff: ta da!<br /><br />I am hooked.  Not only do these bags smell fantastic, they are strong and portable.  I use them for work and am buying them for cleaning out my cats' litter as well.  The scent is strong enough that if I keep them near the litterboxes, I'm betting it can even tackle those odors or at least mask them until I can clean.  It's a sweet, uplifting but not cloying scent (I cannot believe I'm talking about poo bags this way) that could easily come from a high-quality air freshener.  Maybe I'll hide some of these throughout the house...

review/summary: Great product
review/text: We first used the unscented version of these bags and were happy with them....until we discovered the scented bags. The scent does a great job of masking the sometimes unpleasant smell of what you are picking up. I've never had a bag break on me, and they are plenty large to use for a 90+  pound dog. Even our dog walker is impressed with these and wanted to know where we found them.<br /><br />I used to buy them locally but the pet stores were always sold out of the scented bags. Getting them on Amazon saves me from visiting 2 or 3 stores just trying to pick up a pack - and the price on Amazon is better.

I live in a NYC building in the middle of an avenue, so I generally bring my dog's waste back into the building with me, up the elevator, and then I dispose of it down the trash chute.  If I don't use scented bags to mask the smell when I take the elevator back up, my neighbors would be very unhappy!  These work perfectly for me & my doggie.

I paid extra so that when I walked with my 'loaded' bag, I wouldn't have to smell the odor. With these bags, trust me, the only thing that has a scent is the poop inside the bag. Don't waste your money--buy the regular bags.

review/summary: Me and my RC
review/text: A company called Chero-Cola Co. had a line of sodas called Royal Crown in 1905. They reformulated one of their products in 1934 and "Royal Crown Cola" was born. Consumers called it RC Cola for so long the company finally made it official. "ME and MY RC to taste mighty good to me" was a popular commerical in the 1970's. It is not available everywhere, so some people are lucky to find it this way on Amazon. A very popular cola in the south, I have heard southerners swear by drinking a glass with a few shelled peanuts in the soda, say it tastes great that way. I have also heard that the combination of a Moon-Pie and RC was big in the 1950's but sounds like too much sugar for me. Either way the 1950's was their heyday and they spent tons on advertising especially with celebrity sponsors like Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.<br /><br />Packaging: It is sold in plastic, glass and cans and like many sodas the glass bottle tastes better but good luck finding it. SMOOTHNESS: It is more smooth than Coca-Cola, but more uppity than Pepsi. CARBONATION: RC has average carbonation, the big two colas are a bit more fizzy. SWEETNESS: It is a little lighter in sweetness than the 2 big colas. COLA Flavor: You can taste the cola pretty well.<br /><br />In 1954, it was the first brand to be sold in an all aluminum can, the first to offer a low calorie diet cola, and a caffeine free soda. Four years later, they introduced the first 16-ounce bottle.<br />Dr. Pepper/7Up company owns this now, and they in turn were bought by Cadbury Schweppes a British company in 2000, who seems to be buying up all the soda companies in the country with the exception for the big 2. Check out their web site.<br />Update: As of June 2, 2007, Cadbury Scweppes is selling off their soda division. Let's hope someone keeps the regional sodas alive.

review/summary: The Only Sugar Substitute Without The Scary Health Warnings
review/text: I am used to see either the pink (saccharin) or the blue (aspartame) envelope. One warns about cancer while the other one warns about brain damage. Splenda does not have any of those. Now, the pink and the blue are gone from our work office. First approved for use in Canada in 1991 and later on in the US in 1998.<br /><br />Splenda is multiple times sweeter than the previous sugar substitutes. Unlike saccharin, Splenda does not have a metallic aftertaste.<br /><br />Another advantage is that Splenda is stable under heat and can be used for baking.

review/summary: Tastes great, less filling, no side effects or aftertaste
review/text: I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the after-taste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.<br /><br />My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from.<br /><br />I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story. I am reaching for the little yellow packets. A box of these lasts me for a long, long time. When it comes to cooking, the Splenda is calibrated to be the equivalent of sugar by volume. In other words, a cup of Splenda is used whenever the recipe calls for a cop of sugar.

review/summary: NOT for pets to repel fleas!!!
review/text: After purchasing two bottles of this garlic spray because I heard it will repel fleas on my dog, I told my vet about it.  He said never never NEVER give dogs, and especially cats, garlic.  Garlic, like onions, contains the toxic ingredient thiosulphate. Garlic contains less of the substance than onions, but is still toxic to animals, especially cats.<br />The product might be wonderful to be used as a human food...I haven't tried it yet but I will, so I am not saying the product is not good.  But I wasted my money buying it for flea repelling purposes, and could have harmed or killed my dogs.<br />Please do not use this product or similar product on your pets.  Consult a vet before using any products on your pets other than what is prescribed for them by your vet! However I will try this on my own food...I'm sure it will be good.

review/summary: Not Bad
review/text: Bought these for my son who has PKU and must maintain a low protein diet.  He seemed to like them.  They have a long shelf life unopened which I appreciate when it comes to a case of anything.  He's not a big sweet eater but I thought some icing might help on the side.  You want to eat them within a couple of days of opening to keep a fresh taste.  Warming them up in a microwave for just a few seconds helps too.

To a package of Ener-G Foods Donut Holes, I shake in some cinnamon & sugar, eat some of the donut holes, and I am happy.

review/summary: Tasty, but need sweetening
review/text: I suppose they probably went light on sweetener in order to allow for health nuts to cut back on sugar -- but without extra sweetening, I found them very un-donut like. And not terribly tasty. But sweetened a bit, they're not bad at all. Possibly a bit dense for donuts, but that's something you quickly grow used to once you're gluten-free; gluten-free generally means you'll have some greater density than you had with wheat.

She thinks it's a treat and gets just as excited over it as she does her liver treats, maybe more.  She even snapped at the cat, and she's usually willing to share her food, treats, and toys with no problem.<br /><br />The ingredients are very high quality, providing excellant nutrition without a lot of added fillers and things she doesn't need.  I'm switching her over to this food.  She loves the taste and I love the ingredients.

review/summary: Actually pretty good tea
review/text: A few quick thoughts on this tea and a response to the polar opposite opinion on here:<br /><br />1) Of course this tea is messy; it is loose leaf tea.  What did you expect?  I put it in a strainer and made tea without any extra "mess" compared to other loose leaf teas at all.<br /><br />2) I'd ordered this tea a few times before and thought it was pretty good.  My wife is a huge tea drinker and normally gets her tea from a place in the mall that rhymes with "Nirvana" and is about 20x more expensive.  She enjoyed this tea herself and, for the price, you cannot beat it.<br /><br />3) Thinking based on other reviews that maybe other teas out there were great, I ordered another bulk tea from Amazon and tried it.  It was a little cheaper and I thought hey, tea is tea right?  WRONG!  I didn't taste any mint at all in it and to be honest it did not taste like good tea.<br /><br />Finally, what do I use this tea for?  I make a big batch of it and put it in the fridge to have iced tea whenever I want.  I've added sweeteners to it and it is still good and even added powdered lemonade mix to it (going for a mint Arnold Palmer thing).  Also very good.  I had to respond because I think this tea is much better than a few others out there and definitely worth the price.

It is particularly delicious when allowed to marinate in sauce of choice in the refrigerator over night, allowing it to become saturated with the taste.<br /><br />Great in chili, chicken 'friendly' salad sandwiches, soup, enchiladas, stir-fry, and so much more.<br /><br />Suggested Instructions: boil 3 cups of your liquid of choice (such as veggie broth). Once boiling, add 1 cup tvp, and continue to boil for 5-10 minutes (longer makes it more tender and juicy). Drain, and use.<br /><br />Note: this stuff is not meant to be eaten raw.

review/summary: Great for chicken recipes!
review/text: I love these TVP chunks as a veggie substitute in recipes that call for chicken. It is great in "chicken" curries, casserole, and creamy soups and stews. Although TVP is normally really boring, these chunks have a great texture and seems to have a really good taste in sauce-rich recipes. They are slightly more chewy than minced TVP, which makes your recipe more interesting. My meat-eating friends don't seem to spot that this is veggie food, so I suppose that is a plus for entertaining ... :-)<br />These chunks reconstitute really quickly (about 10 minutes) in water or cooking sauce. So this is a very easy ingredient to use. The chunks provide good value and a tasty addition for veggie cooking.

review/text: These are super cheap from Berry Farm. You just need to be sure you order enough stuff at one time to make the shipping reasonable. It starts super high, but as you add more items only goes up slowly. These are 'soy flour' so it is likely that they have hulled the soy nuts and made it less good that actual soy nuts with the partial hulls still on them, but the texture is just like a really hard dried bit of bread. They do not soak up fluids much, so you can use them in salads or added to meals without them getting soggy.<br /><br />Very good. Just make sure you order enough in your order to not get ripped off by the high shipping for small orders. Very annoying from this merchant!

review/text: I bought this to make my own homemade vitamin c serum at home. I am not confident of the stability of those expensive vitamin c serums at the store or the high end ones. If they are still good, that means preservatives of some sort. I wanted a good, no-nonsense vitamin c serum so I searched online and found a recipe that calls for camu camu powder. I found this brand and I have used it to make several batches. I only make 10 days worth at a time and it's so easy. I feel more confident that it's working and it feels and looks great on my skin. It's so easy and so inexpensive to make at home, I am so happy. I figured if this didn't work, I can always mix it  in juice and take it as a supplement. So far, I like it. I have even shared some powder w/family to take for their ailments. They say vitamin c is good for everyone... and with all the other benefits of camucamu powder, I do not regret this purchase. It came in fast, and packaged well.

review/summary: Simple Packaging, Great Product
review/text: I've never bought camu powder before, so i cannot compare it to any other brand.  Although, it arrived as they described.  Dark tan in color, extremely fine powder (like white flour fine).  Its not really bitter tasting and it is not sweet.  It is pretty neutral.  I've mixed it in my oatmeal, yogurt, and now orange juice.  It doesn't really change the flavor of any of those things.  It just makes them turn brown.  I ordered it around 4:50pm, they shipped it out the next day.  It came in simple packaging, just as the description said it would.  In a ziplock bag, with all the air sucked out, taped along the seal, inside another ziplock bag with all the air sucked out also taped up plus taped along the seal.  For the price, it is a very good value.  I put about a spoon or 3 in my juice in the morning.  The description for the camu powder seems like they really care about the product they ship.  I'm hoping they start selling some goji berry powder as well.

review/summary: Great, healthy dog food for dogs with food allergies
review/text: My dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy. She specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula. Unfortunately, my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy. I tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better. I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well. However, I can tell he doesn't consider it the most tasty of choices- probably because it doesn't have the artificial flavoring in it. But I'd rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste.

review/summary: Great for Dogs that Chew their Food
review/text: If your dog eats slowly & actually chews his food, then this food is fantastic!  We have 2 dogs, 1 that is a picky eater, so we added water and microwave his food for 30 sec.  He loves his dinner & keeps It down. ( full disclosure, he's not the dog with stomach problems.  Our Boston Terrier, who we adopted from a puppy mill situation, eats by gulping down her food, from her years when she had to fight for food.  She is the dog we were targeting by getting sensitive stomach food; she was having a problem with vomiting & regurgitation.  The good news is, if we get her to eat 2-3 small meals a day and try to get her to slow down, problem solved.  Yet, if she eats fastly, without chewing, regurgitation is still a problem.<br /><br />I gave the food 4 stars because. If we do make sure she chews it ( by feeding her a couple morsels at a time, like giving treats) the food stays down, therefore working for vomiting, which was a huge proplem! (she was vomiting 6-9 times a day.) since switching she has stopped vomiting. I don't think our dog is the only one that eats fast, and it does take much longer to feed her.

review/text: My Dogs love this natural kibble.  It's simple (only rice and protein) yet tasty.  They maintain a healthy weight and have regular and healthy bowl movements.  Wellness is a fantastic product for dogs because they keep in mind the many ingredients that are not natural to a dog's diet and keep it out of their food.

review/text: I have a dog with severe allergies we have been fighting for years. The vets always recommend mass produced allergy formulas like science diet.  I can't stomach feeding my dog that type of garbage. But simple is a good alternative, made with quality ingredients and the dogs love it too.  Great product!!

review/summary: Wow - great coffee!!
review/text: I'm not a coffee snob, other than I like to grind my beans fresh and use a French press.  I'm generally on a budget, but I haven't been completely happy with what's available at the supermarket - either quality or price.  I decided to give this a shot because of the price and reviews, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />First, this coffee smells incredible - it's almost reminiscent of popcorn, in a way. But I can't really describe the earthy, toasty smell other than it's the best smelling coffee I've ever encountered.  I'm not too familiar with low acidity coffee, but this brews up with great, complex flavor, but it's also incredibly smooth and has good strength.  After brewing this several times I'm finding that I like it more and more with time.  It's just a wonderful, satisfying cup of coffee to have at home.  To me it's much, much  better than anything I can find at the supermarket, and you can't beat the price.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with this purchase.

review/text: Since the price of coffee at the stores has become totally out of line we have been buying different types and roasts from the various suppliers within Amazon.  We have not yet been disappointed, this one is a good medium roasted bean which is fine for everyday.  Most of our friends find our coffee too strong or too dark, so we don't waste the good stuff on visitors!<br />P.S.  We always buy the beans and have used the same old Regal (Moulinex) grinder for more than 30 years.

review/summary: Pleasant earthy beans, low acidity, but it lacks a certain interest on its own - blend it with brighter beans!
review/text: It's so hard to describe tastes, how do I write a helpful review? I like to grind my own coffee right before brewing and I use a french press every day and when I'm lazy and also like to make Turkish coffee on special occasions for 1 or 2 friends or just myself.<br /><br />I like dark (but not too dark, not bitter) earthy brews - I usually steer away from "bright acidity" and "fruity" beans (though when I tastes those I can still tell if it's good coffee or not). I drink my coffee with sugar, but no milk (except sometimes when I'm in the mood). I also don't like overly dark, skunky or burnt coffee. I really don't care about how much caffeine is in the beans, but if you must know the darker roasts have less caffeine remaining, even though they may taste "stronger" :0)<br /><br />Just for reference: I like Peet's "Major Dickason blend" and Starbucks "Verona" blend and Espresso roast, they're not the "best", but indicative of what I'm going for. But I really don't like what Starbucks puts in their cups, which everyone carries like they're wearing a uniform.<br /><br />Anyway, I bought a 5 lb. bag of these Brazilian Santos and also a dark version. I like the dark a little better, but they both taste like versions of itself and are very good, well rounded, solid beans. I ordered these because I can't really find Brazilian beans anywhere locally and also because I like their low acidity.<br /><br />But these beans on their own don't really produce the most complex (or "interesting") cup - I use these to mix with certain more assertive coffees I got from Costco, to stretch them out and breathe a little more interest. I think they're ideal for that, because they're good enough where they don't take away flavor, but neutral enough not to take over the flavor.<br /><br />I don't regret buying these and Coffee Bean Direct is a great deal, but I will try another kind next time - I usually only come back to exceptional brews and I only just discovered CBD, so there's more to try.<br /><br />Perhaps, if I owned a coffee shop or a pastry shop or cafe, I would use these (and their darker version) because it seems like the coffee that would please everyone. These are like home-made chicken soup - impossible to hate (and SO much better than store bought), but also not really a 3-star entree :)<br /><br />I hope this helps, if you have questions I'll try to respond :)

review/text: I was hesitant to buy 5 pounds of anything, much less coffee. But I decided to try this based on the roast and the reviews and am not in the least disappointed. Not being a coffee "Snob", I don't get into acidity, fruity, nutty, or whatever, just like a good cup of not bitter coffee. This is it. When I received the 5 pound bag, I used my vacuum sealer to put about 1/2 pound in each bag and put them in the freezer. Each bag I have opened and ground tastes just like the first beans out of the bag. I use this with a Keurig coffee maker using an EZ cup holder and it makes a great cup of coffee.
