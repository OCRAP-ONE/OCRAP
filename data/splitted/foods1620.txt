review/summary: Excellent coffee!
review/text: I use a moka pot every day, and this coffee is perfect for it.  Strong, with chocolate notes, it definitely starts my day well.  I drink it half milk/half coffee at breakfast. I wouldn't use it in a drip coffeemaker, it's best in a Bialetti moka.  Price has definitely gone up, though, but the subscribe and save will lower it a bit.  The Lavazza Tierra is the only Lavazza I like, otherwise I'd get the Segafreddo red. Love it!

review/summary: Disappointing coffee
review/text: Definitely disappointed in this coffee from Lavazza. I've had a couple of their other coffees including the Gran Filtro that is very good. However, this one leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The coffee is a light brown and very fine grind; almost a color and consistency of a can of ground chocolate.  In my opinion, the brew is weak and exceptionally bitter in comparison to most other ground coffees I have purchased and certainly the other Lavazza varieties that I have tried.<br /><br />This is definitely not a product that I will be re-purchasing.

review/text: I don't know what "100% Sustainable Ground Coffee" is (and don't care); all I expect from any coffee is decent flavor & aroma & Lavazza Tierra! was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Maybe the problem is the unusual fine (almost fluffy) grind, but when I opened the sealed can & didn't get the usual great aroma of fresh coffee, I knew there was trouble.<br />I hate to throw it away, so I guess I'll use the rest up by mixing it in small proportion with my regular coffee.<br />Stay away!

review/text: Describing this material as "cranberry tea" seems unfortunate.  It is merely bitter black tea with a few shreds of something not definable. Perhaps I should have realized from the picture that it would have no cranberry flavor or scent and ordered the cranberry-apple instead.  I will return it to the company and they can compost it, because that is its only value. Laurence

review/summary: As Good as Imported
review/text: Now here's the thing, I'm a huge fan of imported Italian hard salami. As a sandwich meat, a pizza topping or appetizer, there's not much better as far as I'm concerned. Now domestic brands are a different story. My experience with them had been uniformly bad, until now. This Bridgford Hard Salami is excellent. Not just OK, but stands up well compared to any of the imported Italian meats I've tried. If you like salami, this stuff is the real thing.

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: Given the positive reviews posted, I thought I ought to give this sausage a try, particularly given the higher cost of salami I had purchased from other companies (Columbus Salame Company and Fortuna). The Bridgford salami was kind of a disappointment-fibrous and greasy with a somehow duller taste. Kind of like a Slim Jim with less heat and more sawdust (I'm not implying there is really sawdust in it-it just has a different texture that what I'm used to). My wife took a bite out of her slice, then put it aside and didn't nibble on it further... that is actually not a common outcome in encounters between my wife and bits of food. I did bake it with some cheese in some soon to expire canned pizza dough and it was pretty decent-my son really liked it. All in all, I'd say go a little upmarket if you are going to use the salami to snack on with fresh fruit, olives and whatnot but this product is probably fine for cooking.

review/text: Well, what can I say?  I regret this purchase of Bridgeford Italian salami (I didn't buy the hard salami).  The quality of the salami is just so-so, not terrible but not comparable in quality to slightly more-expensive salamis available at my local grocers.  The taste?  Not bad but not great either, a walk on the mild side (in other words, bland and a bit rubbery-tasting).<br /><br />Stick with Hillshire Farm, Genoa, Gallo, etc...Bridgeford makes good pepperoni but their salami is sub-par and not worth the money.

review/text: I just tried Bridgford Hard Salami for the first time. I'm no salami expert, but I have been eating food my whole life, and this tastes really good in my opinion. The texture isn't grainy like some of the more gourmet brands I've wasted my hard earned dollar on. Surprisingly it isn't very greasy, no gristle bits, no bitter aftertaste, and it smells good for a salami. Their use of salt and spices are well balanced. You could eat this with a sweet beverage and there is no conflicting flavors. Overall I rate this 5 stars and will be ordering this from Amazon again.

review/text: To be fair, I didn't purchase this product.  But I found it outside of someone's home as I was wandering the streets.  What I found to be exact was 3/4ths of one of the salami, in some sort of pet food dish as if left for a pet or some wildlife.  Well, since it was left outside, I decided that the owner might not care if I went ahead and ate it.  So I did, and it was wonderful!  I am only giving this product four stars since like "Mntijo" here with his review it was a bit greasy, and I also had stomach distress after eating it.  But this product is still delicious!  I do hope the owner of the home that placed this salami outside orders more, I'd love to get more free food of this caliber.

review/summary: Something Unique
review/text: Lapsang Souchong - 'Russian Caravan' as it is commonly known - is a truly exceptional Chinese tea, and it is done proper justice by the ladies at Culinary Teas. A generous teaspoon of Lapsang Souchong steeped for about three and a half minutes in roughly 190-200 degree water will yield a strong, flavorful cup of the Fujian Province's most notable tea. What is so respectable about Culinary Teas' Lapsang is that it manages to contain immense flavor with very little of the aftertaste common to lower-grade Lapsang Souchong.<br /><br />But how does it TASTE? The answer is both mysteriously complex and blindingly simple. A quick sniff of the pine-needle-roasted leaves brings forth the aroma of a campfire; this flavor carries well into the brewed tea, creating a strong, smokey aroma and flavor that does not fade as the tea cools. Culinary Teas' evenly fired, full-leaf Lapsang Souchong ought to be placed at the top of any tea enthusiast's shelf as the strongest, most impression-making tea in Culinary's collection. One does not forget the first experience with Lapsang. Do it right by using this brand.

review/summary: A fine cup of smoky tea
review/text: This Lapsang Souchong from Culinary Teas has a rich, complex flavor that surpasses quite a few other brands at a price that is comparable to or better than most.  A pound of loose tea can take a while to get through, though, so this may not be the best choice for someone looking to try smoked tea for the first time.  If you are already a fan of Lapsang Souchong and are looking for a satisfying cup, this is a great find.

review/summary: Less smoky flavor than some other Lapsang Souchongs
review/text: What first attracted me to the Lapsang Souchong variety of tea leaf is the distinct Latakia-like smoky flavor. This particular variety strikes me as unusually light on the smokiness. Granted my experience has so far been limited to the Twinings variety that comes in tea bags and the variety sold by Le Pain Quotidien bakeries. I thought that perhaps letting this tea steep a bit longer might help, but I've found that by the 5 minute point, the tea becomes disappointingly bitter and sour. I guess if you're looking for a more subtle, mild version of Lapsang Souchong this might be perfect.

review/text: I have tried several brands of coconut oil and always come back to Kelapo. The taste is not at all "coconut-y" and I can use it too cook with in just about any dish. Other brands I have tried either had too strong of a taste and/or did not sit well with me after digesting. Kelapo is now the only brand I use.

review/summary: Delicious, Inexpensive Hydration with Minimal Calories
review/text: Crystal Light is a great way to cut calories from your diet, while saving a remarkable amount of money.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  CUT CALORIES:<br />  - Overall, males consume an average of 178 kcal from sugar drinks on any given day, while females  consume 103 kcal, as reported by the CDC study(Center for Disease Control). You can drink your fill of Crystal Light every day and consume less than one tenth of the calories you would drinking either juice or soda, making it probably the most effective way ever to cut calories. If you drank about 2 liters of Crystal Light every day, according to the nutrition information, you would consume 5 calories for every serving of 8 fl. oz. Since there are about 33.814 fl oz./liter, 2 liters would net you 42 calories (the way I mix it with extra flavor would probably be about 55 or 60 calories a day), which is still great when you consider that the average man just cut more than 100 calories a day from his diet. Sugar drinks represent at least 6% of the average Americans caloric intake. To put it in perspective, the average 2 liter bottle of soda is between 800 and 1000 calories (kcal). Cutting that alone will result in noticeable weight loss over the long-term.<br /><br />  SAVE MONEY:<br />  - Volume wise, you will save an exorbitant amount of money switching to Crystal Light from either soda  or juice. Just replacing soda at anywhere between $.49 and $1.00/liter (if you're buying in bulk, not including purchases from vending machines, restaurants, etc...) with Crystal Light at a max of $.30/liter (depends how you mix the beverage; i like a lot of flavor) will save the average person in the U.S. (consumed 219 liters of soft drinks/yr (2002)) from $41.61 and $218.70. That isn't even including the money that would be saved by also removing other sugar-based beverages from the diet, like juice or other fruit drinks. Don't even get me started on beer, wine, wine coolers, etc... and the cost difference.<br /><br />  TASTES DELICIOUS:<br />  - Ok, I'm not going to lie. Some of the flavors are delicious, some are NOT:<br />  - Fruit Punch [*delicious] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9ZQ">Crystal Light Fruit Punch Drink Mix (12-Quart), 2.04-  Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a><br />  - Cranberry Apple [*delicious] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9YM">Crystal Light Natural Cranberry Apple Drink Mix (12-Quart) 2.3-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)</a><br />  - Strawberry Kiwi [*extra delicious] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9W4">Crystal Light  Strawberry Kiwi Drink Mix (12-Quart), 2.3-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)</a><br />  - Pink Lemonade [*alright but kinda watery] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OCBSS6">Crystal Light On The Go Pink Lemonade,  10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br />  - Orange Sunrise [*downright, horrifyingly disgusting] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9SI">Crystal Light Sunrise Classic  Orange Drink Mix (10-Quart), 2.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />  - !!!Try Mixing the flavors together; I have had great success with my experiments!!! ;)<br /><br />  NEW PACKAGING:<br />  - The new method of delivery is as easy as it is awesome. It is great to be able to slowly pour the plastic tubes of powder, rather than the tubs, which exploded in a cloud of pink powder all over my face every time I tried to add them. They also easier to open, especially for those of use who don't have fingernails to peal those pesky, foil wrappings off.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS:<br />  - You definitely take a risk consuming non-sugar beverages that still taste sweet and delicious. No one really knows how these type of drinks will affect human physiology in the long term. Obviously the healthiest alternative to drinking sugar-engorged beverages like cola and strawberry daiquiris would be to just drink water, but we all know that NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO DO THAT. DUH!<br /><br />  STAINS:<br />  - The red, colored drinks stain everything. They will stain the hell out of your hands bright red, and every passerby will ask you why it looks like you just fought the battle of Persepolis. Don't get it on your clothes. It is even hard to get the stain off counter-tops and tables. Don't be a KLUTZ!

review/summary: Tastes great and reduces your calories consumed!
review/text: Like everyone else I need to watch my calories, maybe even closer than I do!  I also don't like to always drink low calories soft drinks because of the carbonation.  Crystal Light is a mix that helps me to achieve that goal.  I love the flavor of the Fruit Punch mix and it has virtually no calories or caffeine.<br /><br />This is great with lunch or dinner and it adds a zest to your water to make it more enjoyable.  Crystal Light is relatively inexpensive and taste great.  It certainly costs less than canned sodas and is easier on my stomach.<br /><br />Just be careful with spilling this flavor as it stains everything!

review/summary: Beware No More!
review/text: If you're willing to order FOUR 12-quart packages of this product, presumably you're already familiar with it and don't need a review to validate your purchase decision. My primary purpose in posting this review, therefore, is simply to rebut the previously posted, unfair one-star review which addressed a customer service issue rather than the product itself. Although it's certainly valid to raise such issues, I don't think it should impact the PRODUCT ranking, so I've given this item the five-star rating I believe it rightfully deserves.<br /><br />That said, I will make a few additional comments.<br /><br />I ordered this item via "Subscribe & Save" and received it in three days. The FOUR canisters come in a pre-packaged (and sealed) plastic bag marked "Ready for shipping," which would seem to ensure that you'll always get the right amount.<br /><br />The price was recently reduced, making the per unit cost comparable to what you'll probably find in your local grocery store (assuming you can find this flavor).<br /><br />If you're a long-time Crystal Light consumer, you'll really appreciate the new, more "user friendly" packaging; the canisters are easier to store, and both the canister and individual tubes/packets (not tubs) are easier to open.

review/summary: Don't really care for the taste
review/text: I love Crystal Light's Pure products that are sweetened with natural sweeteners (stevia). This one is sweetened with aspartame and I don't care for how that tastes - I'm not a fan of diet sodas, either. I really like fruit punch, but this just has a very artificial taste to it and does not feel refreshing to me when I drink it, although adding extra water and a lot of ice did help. They also used way too much red dye in it. It easily stains plastic containers and counter tops - I would dread getting it on clothing or carpet.<br />I do like Crystal Light products but will stick to the Pure from now on.

review/summary: Is as described. Freeze-dried ice-cream
review/text: If you've ever had freeze dried ice cream before, this is the stuff. The size of each treat isn't very large, but definitely enough to enjoy. Each bar is individually wrapped. It is also lots of fun to give to anyone who hasn't had it before.<br /><br />If you don't know what freeze dried ice cream is, it is pretty straight forward. All of the water is removed from normal ice cream in a special way. First the ice cream is kept frozen while a vacuum is applied to it. The vacuum causes water to slowly sublimate and vaporize. The vaporized water is eventually all sucked out and you are left with a chunk of ice cream that has everything in it but water. Note, it doesn't melt. The process brings water straight from the solid to gas. This technique is used for lots of foods because it makes the food last forever -- without water most bacteria and molds simply can't grow. If you are a hippie, feel safe. The process doesn't use any crazy chemical science that'll kill your mojo.

I've had it since I was a little girl because I grew up in TX where NASA was close by.  It is really convenient to feed to kids in particular because there is no mess to clean up afterwards.  The best thing about the ice cream is that it really packs more flavor than you would expect and when it melts in your mouth you'll be glad you tried it.

review/text: I bought this out of curiosity, after hearing the buzz about it on the internet. I took my chances and bought 10 packages of these.<br />They are fantastic! It came in a box, with 10 individual wrapped packages.<br />These freeze dried ice creams are broken into pieces (Stop blaming packaging!) for a reason, so they are more easier to bite into, and because they crumble after being freeze dried at -40 degrees!<br />I love these, and I am definitely planning to buy more, just in different flavors (this flavor is great, I just don't like vanilla. Strawberry is very enjoyable). Very light and compact, and you can bring it with you in a bag or a purse when you're craving ice cream but it's raining, or whatever.<br />Highly recommended! Cheers, Amazon.

review/text: My son loved sharing this with his class for show and tell. Two bags was enough for his entire class of 20 to sample. They all thought it was great! Ice cream that isn't cold is a hit in the winter months up north. As an adult, I would suggest sucking on it, do not chew. It gets stuck in your teeth and kind of reminds me of the caramelized remnants on the ice cream lid. Not recommended for culinary connoisseurs. Made my children feel closer to the astronauts though!

I've read other reviews complain about they come broken apart - but that's normal/acceptable - it in no way effects the quality of this product. The packaging of this is bulky - almost 0.4oz per! Luckily this product stays fresh in just a ziplock bag for at least a week. I put most of these in a gallon ziplock and saved several ounces in weight over ditching the stock packaging material. Gave some to my son and he loved them as well - they make a great/unique gift to kids.

review/summary: I'm an Astronaut Ice Cream Addict
review/text: I have been hooked on this ice cream since I first tasted it at the a Science Museum. It is delicious!  It's a great novelty-type gift for anyone who loves ice cream or candy.  It has an interesting texture, it melts in your mouth and it's very tasty.  It's not very filling, so don't worry about that.  You might as well buy it by the lot and/or case b/c it's THAT good.  It also makes a great stocking stuffer for adults and kids alike! :)

review/text: It's cracked to pieces on purpose so it's easier to eat.  It's a bit sweeter than regular ice cream because there's no water.  Convenient to take with you anywhere!  This brand contains NO High Fructose Corn Syrup so it's healthier. Great deal! $19.95 ordered on 8/3/2011. Hooray! It was $27, now it's back down to $22! (as of 8/25/11). Hurry and buy today!

review/summary: DELICIOUS
review/text: If you've never had astronaut ice cream, it might be hard to get used to. The texture is crunchy but kind of gritty while it melts to be super creamy because all the moisture is gone. Some people don't like it, which just means more for me! I personally just like how dense and how flavorful it is. Plus there is always the upside of it being neapolitan, three flavors!<br />It's fun to eat as a midday snack and we like to pretend that we are on our way to Jupiter's big red spot! Great gift for children (or adults who still pretend they're astronauts...) and always a little bit different.

Dry freeze is a process that removes water, and when water is not present, there is nothing to hold the stuff together.

review/text: This kind of tastes like ice cream.  Unfortunately the similarities end there.<br /><br />The creamy texture that makes REAL ice cream feel good in your mouth must have been sucked out of the package along with the moisture back at the factory.<br /><br />Biting down on this stuff is like biting into a hardened piece of neopolitan-flavored insulating foam.  I found it to be a pretty gross sensation and had a hard time finishing the bar.<br /><br />Still, it's worth trying once!

review/text: I was really looking forward to giving the kids at my son's birthday party this ice cream.  The packages arrived quickly, but I could tell the ice cream "bars" were in bits.  I opened one package to take a look and the ice cream was in fact shattered into little pieces.  And the inner packaging was sliced open in two places, possibly by a machine or razor.  It just didn't look right and I didn't feel comfortable serving them to the kids.<br /><br />Now, this is probably not a problem with the seller, but perhaps they want to evaluate their vendor for these products.  I just didn't want anyone else to have this same experience.  Thankfully, Amazon makes returns easy...

review/summary: side dish options
review/text: It's always wonderful when you find a delicious new side dish to accompany your usual evening meals.  I've had other flavors of couscous before, but I really enjoyed this broccoli and cheese flavor.  Couscous by itself doesn't have much flavor so the additional spices in this flavor package really made a difference.  If you've never had couscous before it's basically a very small piece of pasta that's very bland on its own.  If you cook it up using beef or chicken broth, it can really perk up the taste and it makes an excellent side dish to accompany your vegetables.  Of course if you just buy seasoned couscous like this broccoli and cheese box, you won't have to do anything special...just add hot water and the enclosed spices and you're in business right away!  It only takes about one minute to cook up couscous so this stuff is really awesome!

review/text: These are wonderfully light pastries.  They have an excellent taste and stayed crisp after filling and baking. I've used them with beef and chicken, also with fruit and cream for desert. They were well packed and none of them were broken (although several did seperate between layers when removing from the box). They are quite overpriced at the regular price of $62.00, but if you can catch them on sale, as I did through Warehouse Deals, they are well worth it. 5 stars is for the quality of the product, not the price.

review/text: I'm not diabetic and I don't have any issues with processing sugar. I do love gummi bears (especially Haribo). These are soft, not too sweet, less calories (about 1/3 less than sugar sweetened), and flavorful. They are sweetened with sugar alcohol (malitol), so moderation is key. A small handful is all you want to eat at once in order to avoid gas and gastrointestinal distress. These are a great alternative to sugar sweetened candy if you can't eat sugar, are dieting, or are looking to protect your teeth from decay. The sugar alcohol consequences are a good way to limit yourself! Also, if you aren't sure if you are sensitive to sugar alcohols, it's a good idea to try a small bag like this before buying the 5 lb bag!

review/text: When I tasted these, I quickly double checked to make sure they were for human consumption because they tasted like they were made from rubber laced with strange chemicals.  My kids tried them and insisted on spitting them out versus trying to swallow them.  The description is incredibly misleading when it says that they are fruity and delicious.  I just had to throw them out and pretend I hadn't wasted the money.
