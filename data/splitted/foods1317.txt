review/text: I received one of these free with another purchase.  Mine was fresh and delicious. So good that I ordered a box of them.  Hope the great taste comes through in the box, since I have read the other reviews that warn of inconsistency.  I'll update this after I receive it.<br />Update:  the box of 12 bars arrived in perfect condition, and the bars are fresh, crunchy, slightly sweet, slightly salty, and absolutely delicious.

review/summary: Sea Salt, Chocolate & Nuts Oh My!
review/text: OMG - These are the ULTMATE, as far as I'm concerned the cadillac of Kind Bars. Like them even better than the chocolate & peanut butter ones. They basically taste like a great chocolate nut cluster from "individually wrapped candy at" the infamous candy store FM, only better & the hint of sea salt enhances the favor even more. I'm blown away by how delicious these are. And they're healthy 7 grams of fiber, 6 grams of protein, gluten free, are you kidding?  How could something healthy taste THIS GOOD, beyond good? Color me a chocolate connoisseur that's blissed out in chocolate/nut heaven. Unless I try extra hard to limit myself, there's no way these will last until the next "1" month autoship arrives.  They are however very satisfying, & believe it or not stave off cravings for unhealthy junk food. It's one of those products that's almost too good to be true, and if I hadn't tasted it myself I'd have never believed it.

review/text: I LOVED these bars the first time I ordered them!  They were the right combination of chocolate, nuts, and sea salt.  The sea salt made the difference for me.  It was exactly right.  The second time I ordered them, I think they forgot to use the sea salt.  I couldn't taste it at all.  Very disappointing!

review/summary: Fuel!
review/text: These bars keep me going all afternoon; I like that the energy comes mainly from nuts and not quick-to-burn sugar.  And I appreciate that I recognize all the items on the ingredient list!  These bars are made of food!<br /><br />One FYI: I'm not into overly sweet things.  I have my baristas use half the syrup they normally would when they make my espresso drinks and find that plenty sweet.  So, the fact that I find these bars perfectly sweetened means that some people will find these not sweet enough.  My husband described them as, "...okay, but a bit bland."  I'm kind of glad he isn't a big fan.  That means I get the rest!<br /><br />With free super saver shipping, these bars are much more affordable on Amazon than they are in my brick-and-mortar grocery store.  I'm getting more!

review/summary: Tasty, Portable Gluten-Free Snack
review/text: My youngest child is on a gluten- and dairy-free diet and it can be difficult when we are out and about finding safe snacks for her that aren't totally junky like potato chips. I've been a fan of KIND bars for a while because they are portable, GF, all-natural, high in protein and fiber, and don't have a ton of sugar. While these vanilla almond bars are not quite as yummy as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0DMME">KIND PLUS, Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants, Gluten Free Bars 1.4 OZ (Pack of 12)</a> or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034EFIPQ">KIND Fruit & Nut, Almond & Apricot, All Natural, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>, they are still very good. Recommended.

review/summary: A Tasty, and Natural, Snack
review/text: If you are looking for a mid-morning or mid-afternoon pick-me-up, KIND Nuts & Spices Madagascar Vanilla Almond bar is a great alternative to a surgary sweet candy bar.<br /><br />The bar, which is all natural, contains mixed nuts, chicory root fiber, crisp rice, Madagascar Vanilla Almond, and soy lecithin. That's it. No additional chemicals or hard-to-pronounce ingredients. It's all natural, with only 4g of sugar, 5 grams of fiber, and 7 grams of protein.<br />Another big plus for me is the fact that the bars are cholesterol free, with no hydrogenated oils, or trans fats. The bar, because it contains a variety of nuts, is not low fat, however, with 16 grams of total fat, but only two grams of saturated, or bad, fat.<br /><br />Taste wise, the Madagascar Vanilla Almond bar tastes pretty much as you would expect. The bar consists of almonds and peanuts and those are the tastes that dominate, with a hint of honey. The bars are not sticky, however, so they make a good snack if you are work or school. Being made primarily of nuts, the bars have a crunchy texture but the bars are not hard.<br /><br />I like the fact that these are all natural. While the Madagascar Vanilla Almond bar is not a meal replacement bar, they are perfect if you are looking to snack on something tasty and natural.

review/summary: Very Nice
review/text: I really enjoyed these bars.  They are one of the few bars claiming to be "natural" that actually aren't filled with unpronounceable ingredients.  There are very few, simple ingredients, which are all non-GMO.  A gluten free product.<br /><br />Very lightly sweetened.  Calories a little on the high side for a snack at 200 calories, but high in protein.<br /><br />I was mildly amused that the packaging is labeled as "may contain nuts" when it is a nutty granola bar that has visible nuts in it. :)  What can I say?  I'm easily amused.  I will certainly by these again and will be looking into their other flavors.

review/summary: Keep cool or else
review/text: I enjoyed the flavor and contents of each bar.  And if the bars are kept in a cool place you can actually remove them from the wrapper.  Cool doesn't mean house temperature unless yours is 62 degrees.  Otherwise, if somewhat warmer the bars become extremely sticky and are hard to remove from the celephane wrappers.  Expect sticky licking-good fingers as well.  Were it not for that I'd give it a 4+-star.

review/summary: Low sugar, decent protein
review/text: Any nut bar that has only 4 grams of sugar gets my attention. If it doesn't have sugar alcohols in it, even better. But the big bonus here is that the Madagascar vanilla almond doesn't taste like only has 4 grams of sugar. To me, vanilla fakes out my tastebuds to make items seem sweeter.<br /><br />The vanilla overshadows the almond taste, but overall, it's pretty good low glycemic snack. The protein and fiber keep me full longer than higher carb bars.<br /><br />Cut and pasted from the manufacturer's website:<br /><br />MADAGASCAR VANILLA ALMOND<br />Ingredients : Mixed nuts (almonds, peanuts, cashews, walnuts), honey, non GMO glucose, chicory root fiber, crisp rice, Madagascar vanilla, soy lecithin.<br /><br />Serving Size : 1 Bar (40g)<br />Calories : 210<br />Fat Calories : 140<br />Total Fat : 16g<br />Saturated Fat : 2<br />Trans Fat : 0g<br />Cholesterol : 0mg<br />Sodium : 15mg<br />Potassium : 210mg<br />Total Carb : 14g<br />Dietary Fiber : 5g<br />Sugars : 4g<br />Protein : 7g<br /><br />Vitamins and Minerals : Vitamin A (0% daily value [DV]), Vitamin C (0% DV), Calcium (6% DV), Iron (6% DV).Vitamin E (25% DV), Vitamin K (2% DV), Vitamin B1 (4% DV), Vitamin B2 (10% DV), Vitamin B3 (10% DV), Vitamin B6 (4% DV), Folate (6% DV), Phosphorus (15% DV), Magnesium (20% DV), Zinc (8%), Copper (20% DV), Manganese (35% DV)

review/summary: Nuts about KIND nuts
review/text: These bars are really tasty, so I'm really glad I picked it up through the vine program. If you like lots of nuts you'll love these bars. Since there are 210 calories I would say this makes almost a meal,however if your looking for something full of sweet flavor then look elsewhere because this bar is tasty but not ultra sweet. But with 9 grams of protein and an expiry date of Jule 25th 2013 its great for long term storage. These are great for hiking or camping as well so even though they seem a little spendy I think they are worth it will purchase in the future

review/summary: Great Taste - Healthy
review/text: I was looking for a healthy, great tasting snack / protein bar low in sugar - this is it.  I eat 5-6 small meals per day and I occasionally substitute one of these bars for a mid-morning snack or after a workout when it's more convenient than a protein shake.  I purchased 3 boxes after the initial sample and after a few months I'm still not tired of the flavor.  My only recommendation is that the bar should be bigger; it's only 40g in total containing 7G protein, 4g sugar, 0G cholesterol and 5G of fiber.

And the ingredients (almonds, peanuts, cashews, walnuts, chicory root fiber, honey, palm kernel oil, sugar, crisp rice, cocoa powder, non GMO glucose, sea salt, soy lecithin, milk powder, vanilla extract) aren't bad, either. Protein is 7g, and there are 7g of fiber -- so far, so good ... HOLY COW, 15 GRAMS OF FAT per bar! So yeah, they're still delicious, but I would save these for a special treat or times when you really need to stay full (that fiber, protein and fat will keep your tummy full for awhile) -- probably not as an everyday snack unless you're really looking to gain some weight.

I've tried the Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt and the Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants. Both are delicious; best flavor I've found in a health bar. The total carbs are kinda high, but they don't seem to negatively affect my blood sugar like others of the same ilk. A tad expensive, but in my opinion, well worth the extra cost for something this yummy, satisfying, and that *aghem* doesn't give me gas.

review/text: This health bar tastes great, even my 12 yr old grandson enjoyed it.  Not too sweet with chocolate, crunchy with the nuts, very good taste.  I am on weight watchers my only wish is that it was lower in points so I could eat more. Try it you will like it, if you enjoy nuts and chocolate and who doesn't.

review/text: Received this as a promo with another product.  As "energy" bars go, it was tasty enough.  It had a lot of crunchy nuts which I liked and the flavor was good.  I did think it was a little on the salty side and I wouldn't put it in the "healthy" category as it has too much fat.  Except for the high fat, the rest of the nutrition was good.  I did like the chocolate in it.  Would recommend as a convenient snack food.

review/text: I got this for free as a sampler when I purchased a box of 24 popchips when they were on sale for the amazon's gold box deal of the day. The chocolate on the bottom of the car was a bit melted but that's understandable given that it's 85-90 degrees Fahrenheit here, so unless they put ice packs inside the box it would arrive in a melted condition, adding ice wouldn't make it worth it to sell. I ate the bar, tasted great for something with dark chocolate since I'm not a fan of dark chocolate!

review/text: So many people recall the fake taste of yesterday's extracts, so they don't buy them or try them today.  BIG MISTAKE.  You should run, not walk, to the nearest store and load up on Rodelle Organics extracts.  They taste like the absolute essence of lemon, almond, chocolate, vanilla-- and anything you make with them comes alive with flavor.  Add them to a cake mix to transform it from a "mix taste" to homemade.  You will fool everyone, I swear.  They're amazing in pancakes, cookies, anything you already love but wish had a different zing now and then.  Put almond in your frosting, put lemon in your waffles, put any of them in creamy sauces and you will go wild.  This is the best brand out there, so become famous for your brownies and cheesecake, already!

review/summary: Ignore your first reaction...
review/text: This drink shares a lot of its flavor profile with the aperitif Campari.  If you like Campari, you'll almost certainly like Chinotto.  As for the rest of you, read on!<br /><br />The first time I tried Campari, it was on a lark, because a character in Sarah Caudwell's novel Thus Was Adonis Murdered drank it frequently during a trip to Venice.  My first impression was that it was bitter, complex, and a bit overwhelming.  It wasn't awful, but I couldn't really bring myself to like it.  Eventually, I tried it again, and knowing this time what to expect I was better able to appreciate its multi-faceted complexity.<br /><br />I encourage you to practice the same perseverance with Chinotto, whose primary ingredient - a bittersweet citrus fruit - is also a major part of the Campari formula.  You will almost certainly NOT enjoy your first bottle.  Fear not...there are six of them, so take advantage of the opportunity to experiment with your palate.  Wait a few days and try again.<br /><br />You won't know until the second or third tasting whether you are a budding Chinotto aficionado or a detractor in the making.<br /><br />The reward, for those of you who take the time to discover a love of it, is a soda whose balanced taste makes it a far better companion to cuisine than the sickly sweet sodas we're accustomed to in America.  Chinotto marries excellently with the sorts of meals you'd normally have wine with...not something one could easily say of Coke or Pepsi.<br /><br />Ironically, American sodas (particularly the colas) often have complex and interesting formulas, but all that complexity is obscured by an excess of sugar (or sugar substitutes).  Chinotto has sweetness, but it's a balanced sweetness that lets the other ingredients shine through.  It's a drink that wakes up your whole tongue, which makes it excellent as an aperitif or a with-dinner drink.<br /><br />The only reason I give it four stars is that the spirit Campari, and the bottled pre-mixed CampariSoda cocktail (10% alcohol content, very difficult to find outside Italy) both have an extra splash of genius in the formula.  But for those times when you can't be drinking alcohol, Chinotto nearly reaches the same heavenly height.

review/text: I first stumbled upon chinotto at a Italian  food distributor.  We decided to purchase this particular product because the cashier said that it was by far her favorite, although an acquired taste.  I now know why.  My first sip was.....interesting to say the least.  The flavor journey passes through sweet, sour, and unknown tastes.  Initially my favorite element of the sip was the middle, the beginning too sweet, the end too bitter.  After many tries, I can now appreciate every aspect of this unusual but tantalizing beverage.  I encourage anyone who wants to venture beyond the traditional and insipid American drinks to buy a 6 pack, your opinion will change.

review/text: As these ratings suggest, this is a beverage people either love or hate-- no in between. I got introduced to it by my Itallian girlfriend in high-school and then did not see it again for years. 25 years later on a trip to Italy i found it again. (It is a common soft-drink you can found everywhere. Fanta makes a popular version of it. San Pellegrino makes the 'elite' version.<br /><br />I had been under the impression it was made from artichokes because it has a taste somewhat similar in flavor to Cynar, which is an alcoholic drink made from artichokes (also Italian I believe). If you don't like the taste of Chinotto, you will HATE Cynar. If you like Chinotto, you might try the slightly harsher Cynar.<br /><br />But Chinnotto is my 'nectar of the gods' and I savour every miniature bottle of it.

review/text: For me San Pellegrino Chinotto sparkler is a special summertime treat that you have on ice rocks or right out of the bottle after dinner or afternoon break and never with meals. You must not be parched thirsty either, because it is to be sipped slowly to thoroughly enjoy the flavor of this unique beverage. As for the taste even though it is from the Chinotto Orange it has the taste of a herbal/liquorice root beer but sharper. So if you love exotic flavors then I think you will enjoy this fine beverage.

One reviewer here said it tastes like Campari, but I think Chinotto actually has warmer orange notes and lacks some of Campari's sharp antiseptic or medicinal notes.

If you want soda to taste like candy, this is not for you. But bitter it is not. It is very reminiscent of Campari, Cynar, or Fernet Branca.  Think angostura bitters with a bit of sugar and mineral water.  Try it!  There is nothing else like it.

review/text: I love all the Sanpellegrino sodas (except the lemon one actually- so I love the green, red and orange color cans but not yellow) and I bought this assuming it would be similar. It is not really in the same vein at all as the others but it is fabulous. First sip, having no warning, I did not love it. But now that I know what's going on here I am thinking this would have been THE wine substitute while I was pregnant. I guess there may be other times in the future I need a non-alcoholic special beverage. This is it.

review/summary: Love the Taste
review/text: Some people describe this drink as bitter but I don't think so.  It's one of the most refreshing drinks you can have. Yes, it has an interesting taste to it but I never found it to be too harsh.  I buy it here in the states from local Italian deli's and sometimes I buy the red one as well.  But the San Pellegrino Chinotto is truly an Italian classic.

review/summary: Not bitter, just like cola
review/text: After discovering the San Pellegrino product line, I did a search and happened upon this particular product. After reading some of the reviews, I was intrigued and just had to try it. Now, having tried it, I don't understand the reviews at all. Perhaps it's just an example of how very different people's taste buds are. But this product, to me, is not the least bit bitter. It is quite sugary (sugar is the second ingredient listed, next to water). It does not taste at all lemony or like orange. To me, it tastes very similar to China Cola, which is primarily vanilla, clove, and licorice. China Cola, tastes very similar to Coke. The only real plus to this product is that it is caffeine free... but... so is China Cola (which is expensive, but cheaper than this product), and caffeine free Coke. It does have a little bit of an aftertaste which tastes like fermented grapes... a little like a wine cooler, and this aftertaste goes away very quickly. Not bad. It is good. But nothing special. If they bottled it state side, and therefore would be much cheaper, I would buy more often. But, all in all... it's a good drink.. ok, not bitter,... very sugary though.

review/summary: Tastes like Plastic
review/text: Recently I bought a 6 pack of San Pellegrino Chinotto from a local supermarket. Upon sampling a bottle of the item, I promptly grimaced and gagged explosively. While the initial flavour is tolerable, with hints of orange and lemon, the first impression quickly fades into a rather unpalatable bitter taste, rather like melted plastic glad wrap. A definite acquired taste.

review/summary: If I can't stress it enough: ACQUIRED TASTE
review/text: There are many unsual types of colas and drinks that I enjoy.  If I don't like a certain drink, I am at least able to sample it further to decide what it is I don't particularly like about it.  This was not the case with Chinotto.  This drink tastes so awful that it sort of made me gag a little when I tried a second taste.  The best I can decribe it would be like drinking liquid Vegemite.  If you were never brought up with Vegemite and later in life you were able to pick it up and truly enjoy the taste of it, then I would recommend you give this a shot.  If not, go to a store, pop one open, have a quick sip, leave it on the shelf, and then run away quickly!  For advanced palates only.  :)

review/summary: Best Aspartame-free gum
review/text: This is really the best aspartame-free gum that's out there.  It tastes good.  The flavor lasts a long time.  The biggest thing with this compared to other "natural" gum is that it doesn't disintegrate after 15 minutes.  In fact, I haven't been able to chew it long enough to find the disintegration point.  Two other aspartame-free xylitol gum brands disintegrate after 15 minutes.  I hope they keep making this.  I'll keep looking for it and buying it.

review/text: ...But when you don't have a Tim's nearby, this is pretty great! If I'm getting something at Tim Horton's, I tend to get the coffee, but I love their hot chocolate. When I'm making this at home, I put a little soy milk in with the mix because it makes it creamier and more like it is at the actual restaurant. I think it's the best hot chocolate mix out there.

review/summary: Looove it! BTW-Triple Citrus is same as formerly named Desert Lime
review/text: Have enjoyed this for years (before the low carb bubble burst)! Would not even consider trying the newer brands sweetened with aspartame. Splenda may not be good for me, but it is lesser of my three evils. (Sugar's the other, of course). Have tried most of the Baja Bob line and this one is my favorite. Took me a while to find this flavor after the name change from Desert Lime. BTW-We use this for more than margaritas. Add a splash to Crystal Clear (Splenda-sweetened) or water sans tequila for a lite adult flavored beverage. Or make key lime salad dressing with mayo or kefir (fresh ginger is a good addition, too) or a marinade with a little oil and chipotle powder added.<br /><br />If you are really serious about your sugars, carry this to your next party or favorite restaurant. If you are generous enough to share I bet your friends won't taste that it's sugar-free!

review/summary: Best Baja Bob Yet
review/text: So I have to confess that I bought a ton of different Baja Bob's flavors lately to see which ones I like best.  Tonight I decided to open my Triple Citrus and I have to say that it is by far my favorite flavor so far.  It's REALLY tangy and not nearly as sweet as some of Bob's other mixes.  I like their normal margarita just fine, but I think this will be the one I buy from now on.  I would probably advise against this if you don't like a strong tangy punch to your drink or if citrus gives you heartburn.

review/summary: Raisinets on steroids
review/text: This candy is like luxury Raisinets.  If you are a fan of that raisen/chocolate combination ala Raisinets or Chunky you will die for these things.  It is similarly flavored but with a much finer chocolate than can be found in a box of movie theater candy.<br />When I first had them I asked myself how can you have a chocolate covered pitless pomegranate?  There is no process in the world, high speed or low that can depit a pomegranate and leave the fruit intact.  Well, turns out that these are filled with a fruit concoction providing for a center that is larger than a pomegranate seed.  The flavor is pure bliss.<br />Brookside was a small company and was bought out by Hershey's allowing for greater distribution.  But this isn't made in the Hershey Bar factory.  The fine quality of this product has been untampered with by the smart folks at Hershey's.  In fact, my first experience with this product was when my daughter brought it home from a day at Hershey Park.  Thanks, Mer.<br />While it is available at some stores, the best value by far was from Amazon.

review/summary: TOO GOOD FOR MY OWN GOOD
review/text: I agree with Chuck...these are TOO good. I ordered my first bag because I wanted the health benefits of Dark Chocolate without that wretched bitter taste that makes me not like dark chocolate. Also, several research studies have demonstrated the benefit of (something in) pomegranate in going after ugly things like cancer cells. So, I tried them and and they were sooo good tasting (No, make that GOOD TASTING!!!) like those things you start eating and just can't find a stopping place, you know? I now SLEEP with a bag of these. My husband really likes them, too, and I find that sometimes when he rolls over, I find that he is in truth groping for the Brookside bag.<br />  Now the other downside is that these are high in fat...and it is ugly Saturated Fat, high calorie, contain cholesterol, and contain sodium. One MUST not give in to unrestrained eating of these yummy little bits, or one will have the shape of your average hippopotamus and lose all those nifty health benefits. This amounts to eating like a smallish handful per day...sort of like trying to put only one bubble in your bath. You might wonder why I still gave them five stars when I realize how UN-healthy they could be in excessive amounts...and the answer is because the taste calls for more than 5 stars, so health=3 stars, but taste=8 stars. Beware!<br />  I ordered the single bags with no problem. Then I ordered the two-bags from GR8-Mart, but, being in the throes of my unrestrained addiction for them at that time, I ordered 4 bags (2 bunches of 2 bags each). I think this must have confused their packers who are probably unused to really piggy people ordering that much, so I only received two bags total. I contacted this seller with terrific fast follow-up in getting my other two bags to me, so I'm ordering from them again.<br />  Just follow these rules and you will be okay:<br />  1. Don't eat more than a handful a day.<br />  2. Don't sleep with your bag next to you.<br />  3. Don't expose tubby family members to these...too dangerous. Plus, you might have to get creative in hiding your bag(s) from them!<br />  4. Don't keep your bag in a hot place (Duh!), and try to reseal the bag after each foraging because I suspect that even gnats, little ants, and no-see-ums would be interested in these.<br />Incidentally, we had to drive to several days of meetings, so I packed my Brookside bag in a large strong ziploc with two of those frozen gel ice packs, and all arrived successfully with no chocolate melting despite outside temps (while stopping for lunch, etc.) of 100-plus.

review/summary: Great if Brewed Right
review/text: Gyokuro as simply the best tasting tea we've tasted - and we've tasted plenty.  I've had this tea (English Tea Stores brand) and the Teavana brand Gyokuro.  I'd say both are excellent teas.  The Teavana brand is definitely a higher grade tea.  This can mostly be discerned from the slightly more illustrious flavor that the Teavana Gyokuro provides.  Additionally, the English Tea Stores brand tends to be less forgiving of improper brewing temperature - it gets bitter easier.  I noticed that the English Tea Stores brand tended to be a little drier and more brittle.  Teavana gets the tea into your hands while the leaves are still *moist* and in whole strips.  The English Tea Stores Gyokuro was starting to crumble and you will end up with more sediment in your tea.<br /><br />Once we started brewing the English Tea Stores brand Gyokuro in our new Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp 1.7-Liter Stainless-Steel Cordless Electric Kettle, the tea came out acceptably close to Teavana's Gyokuro.  The flavor is outstanding in both cases.  Over time, our purchase of the Electric Kettle will pay for itself because the English Tea Stores brand is much cheaper.  Now we can enjoy the wonderful flavor of Japans greatest tea all the time without emptying our pockets on the best of the best Teavana Gyokuro.  If you do use the Electric Kettle: we use 2 tablespoons of tea (could use less for a milder brew), set the kettle for green tea, put the tea in the water then set a timer for 30 seconds, then remove when the timer goes off.  We also use a cast-iron tea pot that we preheat with a little bit of the water from the kettle, so that might make a difference as well.<br /><br />Overall, this tea is an acceptable replacement to the Teavana brand teas.  If you have the money to buy the tea you want, stick with Teavana.  If you are on a tighter budget, the English Tea Stores is an acceptable trade off if you brew it properly.<br /><br />Ps. The Cuisinart tea pot is AWESOME!<br /><br />- Gyokuro Devotee

review/summary: Gyokuro Green Tea; excellent flavors and fragrance.
review/text: This Gyokuro green tea tastes really good and it has a pleasant clean fragrance similar to other Gyokuro teas I have enjoyed. I regularly drink Gyokuro teas and I do like this one. The Gyokuro teas are naturally without the bitterness of Sencha or other teas; naturally sweet.<br /><br /> I make the tea with hot water that has been cooled down to be hot; but not boiling hot to the touch otherwise bitterness comes out of Gyokuro teas. I just add a little room temperature water to boiling hot water to bring the temperature down.<br /><br />I have made many infusions of this tea from just three table spoons of tea in my (Tokoname, Fukugata) Japanese style tea pot (kyusu) with a ceramic sieve which I use just for Gyokuro teas. I have found the "rishi-tea" and "dens tea" as good Japanese tea pot sources which I have brewed this Gyokuro green tea in. I really like this tea; so I expect to order more later.
