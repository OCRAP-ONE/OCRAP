review/text: Revised 4-2-12<br /><br />I love Stash's Green Tea, and their Chamomile is fantastic. In short, I have always enjoyed Stash teas.<br /><br />I first found this Raspberry & White atrocious, but thanks to a helpful comment I realized that I was allowing this delicate white tea to steep too long. That being said, be sure to not allow this tea to steep for more than a minute, and the water should *not* be boiling. Following that, the tea is most pleasant.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tucker

review/summary: This tea is delicious
review/text: This Chai tea has such a great flavor. I drink it year round. In the summer I make iced tea out of it and always keep a container in the refrigerator. Once it cools off outside and I need to warm up I switch to hot tea. I've tried several other brands and always come back to this one. My grocery store stopped carrying the decaf version which I like since I drink so much iced tea in the summer, so I'm happy to see it on Amazon.

review/summary: THE ONLY TEA I DRINK!
review/text: Like others, I too have a big issue with caffeine.  And, most decaf teas are dull. Even the other Chai Teas (in other brands) didn't taste as good as Stash's Chai Tea decaf does.  So, this is the only tea that I drink!  It starts me off every morning.  I add 3 packets of the Natra Taste sweetener and some milk and it's just delicious!<br /><br />I love the flavor.  I do not find it heavy in clove, or cinnamon or anything.  I find this a very nicley well-balanced, flavored tea.  Of all the Chai Teas on the market (reg. or decaf) I love Stash's blend the best of all.<br /><br />I was buying it regularly at my Safeway grocery, and then for some reason, it just wasn't around anymore. In fact, there wasn't any decaf tea at all in the store.  Geez!  So, then I went over to the Giant (a longer drive), and was buying it there.  Suddenly, it's not there anymore either. Geez!<br /><br />Thank God I found it on-line.  So, these people have me now as a loyal customer and I hope this is going to be available for a long, long time.

review/summary: First Time Tea Drinker
review/text: I never drank tea before, then a friend bought me a Chai Tea latte.  I liked it.  I didn't know what brand would taste the most like what was bought from this coffee/tea stand.  I liked that Stash has a decaf, because I intended to have it as an evening drink so I went with that.<br /><br />Day one, I didn't steep it long, yet it tasted very strong.  I added skim milk as that is what I use, which did not help it along since it's not rich, also I added sugar as it's supposed to be a sweet drink.<br /><br />Day 2, I bought regular soy milk, no low fat or no vanilla soy since the tea has vanilla.  I didn't steep the tea as long, I used a bit more water, then added 1/4 of a cup of soy milk along with 2 good sized teaspoons of sugar.  It tasted perfect! I think I could probably reuse the tea bag today for my 3rd cup!<br /><br />Reviews can be off when people do not use a product properly, and maybe other users are used to a different brand, as I have seen other brands with different ingredients.  I'm happy with it, to where I don't feel the need anymore to try another tea, since at first, I thought I may have to.  I have a local store that sells items at a good price.  18 bags were $2.69, so I have no reason to buy it in bulk online.  I think I'd save 8 cents on a 3 month supply, then there's shipping.

Any longer brings out a strong bitter taste thanks to the very young tea.

review/text: I gave up coffee a little more than a year ago, and have been, shall I say adventurous in my pursuit of an alternative. I've become a fanatic tea drinker, and find that only those with natural ingredients are worthy. Stash makes a phenomenal lemon ginger tea- but this chocolate hazelnut, although full bodied, leaves a bad taste in my mouth- an aftertaste, that is. I believe it has to do with the fact that it has natural "flavors". No real chocolate or hazelnut here folks. I gave 3 stars because of the quality of the tea.

review/text: Stash Chocolate Hazelnut tea is my new favorite variety (and I drink a lot of tea). I bring the water just to the point where it starts to boil and then I pour. I let it steep for about 3 minutes and drink it hot. I added a half packet of stevia and a dash of milk to this tea and loved the results. It tastes rich and smooth and for me is a great substitute for hot chocolate. I could definitely taste the chocolate, but the nut flavor was less noticeable. I especially like that it's decaf, so I can drink it in the evenings while I'm relaxing with a book. I haven't tried it iced or without milk, but I plan to. I've tried other Stash teas and thought they were superior to most other brands I've tried.

Add some sugar and milk and it's a real treat. I agree with the reviewer who found it reminiscent of hot cocoa. It does have a tiny chemical smell, or maybe that's the vanilla. I have a poor sense of smell. It's a very cozy winter tea, but I like it too much to not have it all year 'round.

review/text: I found these delicious treats in a traditional pizzeria not far from my house and I have never found them elsewhere. Most blue cheese olives come packed in a vinegar brine solution that completely annihilates the flavor of both the olive and the blue cheese. Not these little guys. They are packed in an oil concoction that completely complements the cheese and olive. I am so happy to have found them on amazon! I use them pretty exclusively in vodka martinis, but they are amazing as an appetizer as well. Yum!

review/text: My mom is a huge fan of these blue cheese stuffed olives. She had been buying the Mezzetta olives from a local specialty store, but they changed their recipe and instead of packing the olives in a light oil they began packing them in a vinegar and salt brine like most others do. She likes the oil packed and says they are much milder and flavorful -- the brine overwhelms the others. She was so disappointed she couldn't get them anymore until we found these. While she says the Mezzetta still had a slightly better flavor, these are a really good second place for her.

I don't think of them often because they are not sold in my area, but I did find a brand of blue cheese stuffed olives for a ridiculous price tonight.  I decided to wait to check Amazon.com, and I am ecstatic to find these!  As another commenter noted, the oil-pack is so much finer than vinegar.  There is absolutely no comparison in quality, flavor, and value!  Had I only known before today that these were available here, I wouldn't have bothered to request my local grocer carry them; they never seem to have what I want, anyway, as most consumers won't achieve a palate for such exquisite deliciousness!

review/summary: Not for martinis
review/text: I bought these olives as the garnish for Dirty Martinis.  When I make a dirty I like to garnish with 3 olives and a blue cheese olive makes the cocktail all the better.  I chose these olives because of all the positive reviews seen here.  My first problem with these olives is the consistency of the blue cheese, it's almost liquified.  Typically the blue cheese in a stuffed olive has a slight firmness, not with these.  You bite into them and there is no texture the milky cheese just oozes out into your mouth.<br /><br />My second problem is that they are packed in oil.  This is what initially sold me on them, the whole preservation and flavor enhancement seemed logical.  But when you drop these olives into the martini you get an oil slick on the top of the cocktail, makes for a lousy and unappealing presentation.  Martini Exxon Valdez.  Keep in mind I am not using this jarred juice for a dirty I use bottled olive juice brine.<br /><br />My final problem is I'm stuck with a case of these.  I was so jazzed by the reviews I thought ok I need a jar but these sound so great I'll deal with the only buy option of 6 jars and spend the 50 bucks (for olives?!)<br /><br />My suggestion: buy some unstuffed olives and get some good quality crumbled blue and do it yourself.  It will be worth the effort and so delicious.<br /><br />For now I'll deal with this, I'm stuck for the next 2 years or so blotting them with a paper towel and enjoying an icy chilled vodka dirty martini, I'll still catch a good buzz, things could be worse!

What a shock when the new bottles arrived with a new formula that made them virtually undrinkable. I am sad because I have loved these waters and now I will have to stick entirely with True Lemon products to provide some variety in my drinking water. Hint Water is too expensive although I love some of their flavors, too, and virtually unavailable in my Nashville area. True is more economical and tastes great. Twist Waters were my indulgence over sodas and other artificially sweetened waters. I loved the old Twist water flavors--especially the Lime and Strawberry--as well as the Pomengranate Blueberry and Mango Acai. Now they are all ruined. I won't be buying or drinking this brand again unless the old formula is returned. I prefer nine calories over calorie free Stevia based drinks that leave a bitter aftertaste.

review/summary: Not What I Expected
review/text: I ordered this product believing it to be the original premium water I love.  Instead, I received "Essence Water", a version "enhanced" with stevia extract which in my opinion, absolutely ruined this product.  I was sooooooo disappointed.  Kudos to Amazon however, for crediting the cost of the product following my complaints about an additive many still find controversial that wasn't shown in the product information.

review/summary: Product now has artificial sweeteners....beware
review/text: For some reason the makers of Twist have recently replaced their naturally sweetened waters (using Agave) with Stevia Extract so the product now has 0 calories instead of 9. The Agave sweetened product was great and I was drinking a couple dozen of these a month. Now its just like all the other flavored 0 calorie waters using artificial sweeteners with the typical aftertaste. Very dissapointing.

review/text: I too am disapointed in the flavor change with the stevia!! I loved West indies Lime and was very pleased to find it on Amazon..I could no longer find it anywhere else. The taste is now awful, and the price has gone sky high.  I am unhappy that I will have to find a replacement for my favorite drink.

review/summary: Twist Essence Water West Indies Lime
review/text: I recently found this product at my local grocery store.  And I picked up a few flavors to try.  The first one I tried (Wild Strawberry) was ok, but not spectacular, and this Lime one was absolutely terrible in my opinion.  I really just couldn't stand the taste of it.<br /><br />I usually like Lime.  Limeade, margaritas, etc.  But this flavor of lime was horrific.  It felt like I was eating the pith of a lime with a little bit of zest thrown in.  In fact, I nursed a bottle of this stuff for the whole morning, and by the time I got to lunch I had only drank about an ounce.  It was that bad.  I promptly threw the rest out and switched to plain water instead, even though I normally hate wasting food products.  And it's a shame, because I really had high hopes for this flavor.<br /><br />The saving grace of these drinks is the ingredients though.  They boast a spectacular ingredient list.  This one had agave nectar and stevia as the sweeteners, which is great!  And the flavoring was natural too.  The ingredient list was short, which it should be when you're just drinking flavored water.  It had zero calories, and the sugar content was low, and they even threw in some green tea extract to make you feel healthy as well.  Overall a product with fantastic ingredients.<br /><br />It's just a shame about the taste.  I have one flavor left of this product to try so I hope it turns out to be ok.  If it doesn't, I have a feeling I'll be sticking with some other type of drink rather than continuing to buy these.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/text: I agree with the others that stated this is a very refreshing drink. I have recommended it to co-workers who are also now drinking it. I asked my local grocer to give it more shelf space, and they did. I am now extremely disappointed that they are making it with truvia.  IF you go to any website other than Truvia's, you'll find a host of problems with the sweetner. Talking Rain, PLEASE BRING BACK THE TWIST LIME WATER WITH NECTAR!!!  You're water is now just the same as everyone else's which I don't buy. Guess it's back to flavorless tap water for me.

review/text: My family has been addicted to Twist for a few years so when I saw it being clearanced at the stores I panicked. Then I found them on Amazon so YAY, right...WRONG! When I saw the 1-star reviews I thought they just didn't like those flavors. I wish I'd read them. We bought 2 cases, tore into them then proceeded to spit them all over each other......YUCK...STEVIA!! Twist WAS the diamond in the ruff; now it's just like everything else....NASTY. Believe it or not, there are those who still prefer sugar/agave. Stevia may be natural but it TASTES artificial. Talking Rain, until you return the original formula we don't want to hear what you have to say.

review/text: I did not like this at all.  There was very little lime taste and the taste was not good to me.  I was really looking for a replacement for Adirondack Lime Water because I cannot get it where I live, and this is nowhere near that product.  If I hadn't had a specific taste in mind, maybe this would not have been quite so bad to me, but I threw away the bottle I opened after just a few sips (over a few day period) and gave the rest away.

review/text: I'm new to Keurig and formerly a Peet's addict.  I like a very strong dark roast with a thick mouthy feel. I hate watery coffee.<br />So I started with all the extra bolds....having tried Newman's, Timothy's Sumatra bold, Black Tiger, Midnight Madness as<br />well as Emeril's.  So far, Emeril's is my first choice. Best aroma, which definitely sets off the taste buds. Strong full mouth<br />feel, with a bite on the back end. Not french roast bitter, though.  I'm still hoping Peet's will make some k cups but until<br />they do (when I don't want to use my k cup), Emeril's will be my choice.  Surprised because I did not expect this from a<br />coffee with Emeril's name on it.  I run an 8 ounce in my b30 and it's a solid morning drink.

review/text: I have lived in New Orleans since 1990 and this really does taste like the coffee you'd get at a good local (cf Brennan's) restaurant. Strong, lots of body, but not bitter - stands up to the 10 oz setting, too. Not the only coffee I drink, but it lives up to its name.

review/summary: bold and better than Starbucks
review/text: Emeril's dark roasts are rich and smooth, and make the full "largest" size on a Keurig machine with plenty of flavor. I'm impressed at the lack of bitterness and still the "startbuck" like burn quality. A very good value when compared to other brands,and retains a Designer Coffee flavor.

review/summary: Good strong coffee
review/text: I have a Keurig and use the Emeril cups for my morning has-to-be-strong coffee.  I know many people feel that the other K-cups taste a bit watered down, but these do not!  I often drink my morning cup on the smallest brew size and then work my way up to bigger cups throughout the day as I need less caffeine.  Also, the Emeril's are great with the travel mug setting because they are strong enough that even with all that water it still taste's good.  I use a lot of creamer/splenda though so my taste buds are slightly biased.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the shipping and delivery of this from Amazon took way longer than I expected.  If you need coffee fast - this may not be the way to go, but if you can plan in advance the prices are worth it to order at Amazon (though the absolute best deal is a box of 80 K Cups at BJs).

review/summary: As only Emeril can do!
review/text: This coffee is as big and bold as Emeril himself.<br /><br />One of my personal favorites of all time with the Keurig, it makes a fantastic full bodied cup of coffee without the typical burnt or overly bitter taste normally associated with dark roasted coffees.<br /><br />When brewed an immediate wonderful coffee aroma will fill your kitchen and it develops a very light caramel colored froth that hugs the edge of your cup or mug.<br /><br />A major pick me up, Big Easy Bold holds up to the largest brew sizes and makes a delicious full flavor cup for travel mugs where ordinary K-cup coffees normally become watered down.<br /><br />Brew a small size, top with the froth of scalded milk and you will have the best cappuccino replica you ever tasted at home.<br /><br />Big Easy Bold is best to sit for a brief moment after brewing before adding sugar or another sweetener as the initial "bite" of the coffee quickly mellows into deep rich flavors. I found myself at first adding too much sugar and finding the coffee a tad too sweet a minute later as the flavors settled into one great cup of coffee.<br /><br />If you love rich, full bodied cups of coffee you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />If breakfast blends and watery medium roasts are boring you, kick your cup up a notch, give it a try and fall in love with your coffee again.

review/summary: Not one of my Favorites
review/text: I don't know, people seem to like this k-cup, but it just did not do it for me.  Maybe I got a bad batch, as it was simply overpowering for me.  And I do like many of the bolder k-cups, such as Midnight Magic and Rainforest Espresso, but those are simply better coffees to me.  Maybe I'll give the Emeril's regular another chance, but it did not win me over the first time around.  As a side-note, I really like the Emeril's decaf--it is much more drinkable to me than the Emeril's regular.

review/summary: What's wrong with these K-cups?
review/text: My daughter got a sample of this coffee in her starter pack and raved about it so I bought a box.  The coffee tastes great but out of the five cups I've made so far, two broke open and spewed coffee grounds into my cup and made a real mess.  The one I'm drinking now.....I used a paper towel to try to remove quite a few grounds from the cup so I wouldn't have to throw out three cups of coffee.  This has never happened to me with any other K-cups.<br /><br />I'll stick with Green Mountain Double Black Diamond from now on.  It's great coffee without the mess.<br /><br />Hey Emeril, see what you can do to fix this problem.  I imagine you've lost more than one customer because of it.

review/summary: A little unbalanced
review/text: I love good strong coffee. It's a combination on how it's roasted and the beans used. This coffee is just way too strong. It is unbalanced and though isn't bitter (which comes from weaker coffee) it is a tad over roasted and charred tasting. Instead of tasting toasty nuances you are stuck with a smack in the face. Though very good for that wake up coffee, it's not the coffee to have if you want to savor the rich and delicate nuances that many good coffees bring to the table.

review/summary: My new favourite for a nice bold morning brew
review/text: When using a drip coffee maker, I often slipped in an extra spoonful of grounds to make my morning coffee extra strong so that the milk would not dilute it too much.  After recently having bought a Keurig, I was a bit disappointed at the somewhat watered-down light-bodied taste of most of the K-Cups which came as a sample with it.<br /><br />So my first inclination was to browse the Amazon reviews of several varieties of K-Cup coffee and take advantage of what others who like a nice strong bold cup of coffee had learnt by trial and error - and that was a good move!  I took you all at your word, ordered a 50-pack of this coffee on Monday, had my first cup of it this morning, and decided it was worth submitting my first ever review of any Amazon product ever, both to give it a 5-star rating myself and to thank those of you who take the time & trouble to give honest reviews for the benefit of people like me.<br /><br />So for the record, on a price and quality scale this is my new favourite K-Cup coffee.  Until now, my favourite on a pure quality scale was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008C9QEVU">Starbucks Caff&egrave; Verona, Dark Roast, 27-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a> (excellent but very pricey!) and for a bold-yet-affordable cup was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I3I4">Green Mountain Coffee Double Black Diamond, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a> (also excellent, and less pricey, but IMO not quite as nice in flavour as Emeril's "Big Easy Bold").<br /><br />For anyone looking for a nice strong full-bodied and flavourful K-Cup coffee which won't break the bank, do try this one. If you're like me you won't be disappointed.
