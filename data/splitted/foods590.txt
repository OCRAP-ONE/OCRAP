review/text: I have given my dog greenies before, and he LOVES them!  Moreover, I love the fact that they keep his teeth and gums clean and healthy!  Buying through Amazon is so much cheaper than buying at a petstore, and I love the storage box that the greenies came in!  Highly reccommend, but be sure to buy the correct size treats for your pup!

review/text: My dog won't chew rawhides or any bone really, I've tried them all. After spending $350 to get his teeth cleaned, and getting 15 teeth pulled due to decay, I was on a mission to find something he'd chew on to help clean his teeth. He LOVES these!He's around 12 lbs.  I think the bones are a little on the small side, so next time I'll go up a size, so it'll last longer.

review/summary: My Dog Goes CRAZY!!
review/text: I don't write too many reviews, but I read them all the time...so I though it was high time I wrote a review for this product (my dog told me to).  I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out.

review/text: Our terrier mix adores Greenies (haven't met a dog who doesn't love them, actually)... they kind of have a gummy-bear quality. We give him one before we leave for work so he has a little distraction (only takes him a few minutes to finish one). These are $1.50/ea at our local pet supply store, so buying them in bulk is the way to go. We bought them from Entirely Pets and got a great deal with fast shipping.

Every vet visit comments how well his teeth look with hardly any plaque at all; amazing!  I've pretty much invested a lot of money for my service animal pug who is worth every penny.  But with purchasing different pricing each time through Amazon is something I don't understand.  It would be great for return loyal patrons to purchase same price or honor discount pricing.

review/summary: the best reward/bribe ever
review/text: I have three terriers and most often foster another dog. My dogs will do ANYTHING for a Greenie. One races through agility, because a Greenie awaits him at the end of the class--in addition to small treats after each run.  Right now I am fostering a traumatized little poodle who feared his crate; a Greenie at the back of the crate and he will quickly go in. And Greenies are good for their breath/teeth, healthy and easily digestible. My vet, too, recommends them.

review/text: These are our dog's absolute favorite treat!  As recommended, we only give one each day and make sure he doesn't get choked.  These are not as tough to chew as the old formula, which took him longer to chew.  Greenies are supposed to help clean dogs' teeth and breath, but we buy them because he loves them so much.  The large box of Teenie size has 96, so they aren't that expensive at one a day.  Well worth the price for our loyal baby!  He's been enjoying them for several years with no problems.  Be sure to get the correct size so your dog can't gobble them whole.

They go crazy if they even think they hear the greenie bag...my tiny little Italian Greyhound girl gets a greenie at bedtime, and sometimes she starts pushing us to go to bed and getting wild and begging to go to bed, because she wants her greenie.  You do have to be careful and only feed them one a day of their size range, or they will upset their stomach...you can have too much of a good thing, but as long as you don't overdo it, the dogs love them, and it's a great treat for them!

review/summary: Great buy
review/text: My dog eats a greenie a day and we were very excited to have found them here at such a great price.  The package arrived in perfect condition and they are very fresh.  I have chosen this size Greenie for my chihuahhua, who is approximately 12 pounds.  It has proven to be effective for us, though through time I still notice some tartar buildup on the very back teeth (molars).  Therefore, I am sure to still brush them frequently.  He loves the taste and has been eating them for about a year and a half.

review/summary: ~ Fantastic Price On Greenies ~ One Happy Pomeranian! ~
review/text: Our Pomeranian LOVES Greenies, But I Was Getting Really Tired Of Spending Almost 50 Dollars A Pack At The Local Pet Store, So I Decided To Check On Amazon. I Spent A Lot Of Time Checking Prices From All The Different Sellers And Found That These Ones Were The Cheapest. I Ended Up Getting 2 Boxes For The Same Price That I Would Have Paid For 1 Box At The Pet Store.<br />The Package Arrived Very Quickly & We Even Recieved A Free Sample Size Bag Of Dog Food, Which Was An Unexpected Bonus. The Only Issue I Had Was I Feel They Could Have Put Everything In A Smaller Shipping Box. Other Then That We Are Extremely Satisfied & So Is Our Sweet Little Pom. Thank You Amazon!

review/summary: Does what it supposed to
review/text: I don't know about others, but my dog loves these.  He's a 55lbs golden retriever mix puppy, and loves to chew.  Like a reviewer before me said, this product is like crack for dogs!  The chews don't leave a mess, they occupy my dog for a couple of minutes, clean his teeth and they get rid of bad breath.  A lot of chews are either messy or leave him with bad breath -- or both.  No digestion problems either, like rawhide can cause.  He did have a problem once with a rawhide chew that got us worried - I presume that's the compressed product related problem that a previous reviewer mentioned.  This never happened with the Greenies as they mostly melt away rather than break off in pieces, unlike rawhide.  As far as I can tell, this is a great product.

review/summary: She loves it!!
review/text: I adopted my dog because her previous owner had passed away.  My dog had been eating canned food and her teeth looked terrible.  I tried a couple of teeth whitening treats and toys, but Bailey would have nothing to do with them.  Then I found Greenies and she loves them.  Once she left a couple puddles of saliva on the floor as I was getting out a greenie for her, she was salivating so much.  Her teeth look so much better now and her breath is great.

review/summary: My dog would do anything for Greenies
review/text: My dog absolutely loved Greenies. He would come downstairs every morning and sit in front of the pantry until someone gave him his Greenies. He also learned to do all sort of cute tricks. We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him, never made him sick, and made his breath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day, I would take pliers and cut it into 6-8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day. Once I discovered Greenies, I cut all the other treats out and really only have him the Greenies. The 27oz. tub was in my opinion a really good value for the money so I would always buy that size. I highly recommend this product for all dogs.

The product arrived within a couple of days, and is a great value. Normally a package of 6 or so petite Greenies cost aprox 7.00!

review/text: These treats occupy my dogs (quietly!) while they clean their teeth at the same time. The first time I tried them, I bought the large ones to cut in half so I'd get more for my money, but believe me, it was definitely NOT worth the hassle. They are very hard and hard to cut. The "Regular" size is perfect for my 50-65 lb. dogs.

review/text: I do like that the Greenies are softer, more chewable.  I feel it makes the product a little bit safer for my dogs to have.

review/summary: Bad for My Dog
review/text: My dog was on a bland diet (boiled chicken & rice) so his poop was usually solid but a few days after eating 1 Greenie a day, his poop became more liquid-y and green. Not sure if Greenies was actually the cause until I googled and read on various dog forums about how Greenies have affected other dogs. Stopped giving out my dog Greenies and have thrown them away. BEWARE, Greenies CAN be bad, so watch your dog after giving them out.

review/text: Not the best product for the price. I got these for my dog that has plaque problems but I haven't really seen any improvement since we got them. They are okay to give as a treat but as far as helping with plaque I don't think they work at all.

review/summary: Contradicting photo and description!
review/text: There is contradicting information.  The description says Senior Greenie Large, while the photo shows "regular" as well as 27 treats versus 27 ounce.  Anyone that reviews and can clarify the actual product would be much appreciated.

review/summary: great product
review/text: I was amazed at how well these cleaned my dogs teeth. He is not happy with getting his teeth brushed, especially in the back, the Greenies have assisted with cleaning this hard to reach area. I have read other reviews where people have had trouble with their dogs trying to chew off too much and choking or what-ever - my solution stay with your dog as they chew anything this is just plain common sense. I also give it after his evening meal so that he won't try to swallow to big of bites.

review/summary: Very good value - but manufacturer should switch to a larger bulk bag
review/text: This was an Excellent value of buying on Amazon versus the pet stores.<br />It was packaged and labeled well for shipment.<br /><br />However - the manufacturer's plastic top of the box itself is a little cheap and less functional than I expected.  Frankly, the whole top has to come off each time I want to give my dog a single chew.<br /><br />So - I'm actually putting these chews into a Dog treat jar that has a open-and-close top with a tab.<br /><br />The manufacturer could simply change the bulk packaging to a bag.  Frankly, a Ziploc bag would be just as functional (and probably have a lower manufacturing cost) than the box.

review/summary: Suppliers Make All the Difference!
review/text: Since all Greenies are the same I would suppose that only the suppliers of Greenies could make the difference, and this one certainly did!<br />We received our order for an amazing cocker spaniel in very good time, which made us all very happy!<br />And as far as price goes, that was really a surprise!<br />Even with postage these healthy treats cost less than we had been paying for them in pet stores here in Salt Lake City!<br />You can surely look forward to many more orders from us!<br />Thanks for the great treatment!!!!<br />Ray, Joan and Taz<br /><br />PS  I HAVE NO IDEA OF HOW THE IDENTIFYING PICTURE OF THE PRODUCT I REVIEWED GOT SWITCHED!<br /><br />HOWEVER, PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR DOG EAT THE MICROFIBER CLOTHS (EVEN THE GREEN ONES)!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: Wonderful Treat
review/text: My Shih Tzu is seven and has had one Greenie a day for years.  She is happy, healthy and has great teeth.  She begs for her Greenie every morning.  Don't worry about Greenies causing allergies!  The main source of allergies is CORN in dog food.  Do your little one a favor and go to a grain free or reduced grain dog food.  When you think about it, wild dogs didn't eat corn meal!  If your little one has allergies, you will be amazed at the immediate healing.

review/summary: Great product... Misleading product picture.
review/text: My AKC English Bulldog has been using greenies since he was a puppy, and hasnt had any problems with it. Ive always given him the correct size greenie for his weight, and have never had to take him to the vet. (yet I never leave him unattended with his greenie) The only problem I had with this particular seller was the picture on display, and what I recieved in the mail. Please don't make the same mistake I did, there are only 17 greenies in the box, would have been better off buying them at Petsmart.

review/text: I am sad to say that my dogs are completely addicted to Greenies. They get one every night after our walk and they never let us forget. Once we get inside they go right to their crates and sit and wait until their treats are given. Good treat for small dogs and a great price on amazon.

review/text: Our two greyhounds love the Greenies dental chews.  I prefer to buy them the smaller treats since they are both seniors now and don't like to chew on things for extended periods of time.  The regular size fits that need.

review/text: When we opened the box, we found it to be full of small worms. My husband was able to remove them with a small brush but they shouldn't have been there in the first place. We have gone through many many boxes of greenies and this is the first time we found worms in them. The dogs love the greenies and it helps their teeth a lot.

review/text: As always, amazing price on amazon. Paid the same price for 45 chews, as I did for half the amount at the local pet store. Product shipped extremely quick even using the super saver shipping. My dog absolutely loves these treats. She hates going to her crate, but if I grab one of these out of the box that it came in, show it to her, and say "bed" she literally sprints to her crate in anticipation. Highly Recommended. Oh and her breath is about half as stinky as it was before I started giving her these.

review/summary: Great for my old, spoiled dog
review/text: My elderly (soon-to-be 17) beagle, Dakota, is super picky about what he eats.  Making a different dish (has to have different protein source and flavoring) every other night is the only way I can keep weight on this once food-frenzied chow hound.  The ONLY consistent item he eats -- including dog treats and human table food -- are Greenies treats.  The "Senior" variety is the perfect texture (softer than the regular Greenies treats) for his aging, sensitive teeth.  The inclusion of glucosamine and chondroitin to help with his joints give me hope that it helps the creaking and cracking of his joints.  Whatever the formula they use to make it easier to digest is a plus since I know his aging system doesn't work as well in his older years.  Dakota gets one petite Greenies Senior treat everyday and he has never turned down an offer for one yet.

review/text: These are recommended by all vets that I've seen.  They are healthy, clean teeth and my dog loves them.  I cut them in half though as if he eats a whole (large) one, his tummy doesn't like it.  He has a VERY sensitive stomach though.

review/summary: WORMS IN GREENIES?????
review/text: This is my second box of greenies that I have been quite pleased up until today.  I pull out on greenie and found a WORM along with larvae!! This is horrible.  I had this box for 3 months.  I emptied the box and found about a dozen more worms and was disgusted.  I couldn't believe greenies product was contaminating my dogs.  The expiration date is dated 2013 so this clearly shows that there is something wrong with this product.  I hope someone from the greenies department will give contact me to fix this.  I will be posting these comments on every doggy treat review forum/website until I hear from someone so I know that they are trying to fix it and shows how much they value their customers and product.  I don't know how long I have been feeding greenies with worms in them so my two pups will now have to go to the vet.

review/summary: Observe Pet Reactions to Greenies
review/text: I had good results with this product six months ago.  However, a second purchase that I just opened caused all of my three dogs to vomit within minutes of eating the product.  I removed other items from their diet to be sure and it did it again, instantly. I contacted the company about it and they have claimed no other problems exist(suggesting I must have tainted the product or have exposed it to an environment making the dog snacks unstable, or the company I purchased them from somehow did something to the product. Hmm: sounds troubling to me, especially from the factory.). I have seen other issues out there regarding this product, which vary.  Use your own methods of making a control group, but be sure to see they have proper bowel movements and are not vomiting after you feed them the product.  Secondly, Greenies.com(the Nutro Company) will not honor purchases made through unauthorized vendors.  Amazon directly is an "authorized vendor".  "Monster Pets" is not authorized to resell these items and only those vendors listed on their website are "authorized".  They will only help you return/refund something if it was purchased through an "authorized" vendor.  This now makes me leery of items purchased through "Amazon Marketplace", particularly food items.  Buyer beware!  Caveat emptor!
