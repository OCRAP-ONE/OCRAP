review/summary: Does wonders for bad breath
review/text: We adopted a neighborhood cat a few months ago. She is very nice, but had horrible breath even after we started feeding her various special cat foods. Otherwise great cat, but when she would yawn in your lap, you had to fight fainting.<br /><br />We took "Dentabites" more for fun since our cat loved other whiskas tempations we tried with her, but well, thought let's try to see if it really can do anything about her breath. After about a week of giving her dentabites, we noticed her breath "improved" and after 2 weeks it was amazing. Her bad breath is almost completely gone, or gone as much as it can without brushing teeth i suppose. We didn't change anything in her diet at the time so we were pretty sure it was dentabites that did the job. Also, since then, we've been feeding her various foods but keep the dentabites snacks and bad breath hasn't returned... one more point to be sure that Dentabites really work.<br /><br />Really great product. Just a few treats a day make enormous difference. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Cats love, I only like...
review/text: Well, there is no denying that Temptations knows exactly what cats like to taste.<br />Much like putting MSG in people treats, they have figured out a combination that makes<br />cats go crazy for their treats.<br /><br />HOWEVER - most Temptations are chock-full of grain fillers that cats do not need and do not eat<br />on their own if they are outside cats.  For that reason, we had stopped buying Temptations entirely,<br />even though it was their favorite. It was like junk potato chips for humans, but we were hurting our<br />cats.<br /><br />When we saw this flavor, we thought we'd give it a try, since they both love catnip. (Not all cats<br />respond to catnip.)  I read the back, and it was not quite as gross as their other flavors, but still<br />something that needs to be occasional only or very limited usage.<br /><br />Both cats really liked these.  They only get a three-star rating from me, because Temptations seems to be<br />too cheap to put decent quality foods in their treats. For a pet food manufacturer, they seem to only<br />focus on the costs, not what the HEALTHY part is for your cats. But, I eat some things that aren't good for<br />me either from time to time, so for a sometimes-treat, this one will do.

review/summary: RUIN YOUR LIFE
review/text: I innocently started giving these to my cats - had no idea they would begin to control my life.  Run out of treats?  you're screwed.  One cat cries so loud in the morning it sounds like someone is torturing her.  Eventually, the other cat jumps up on my face to wake me up...for treats.  It's like I'm living in a nightmare if I don't give them their fix.  C'mon...we know big corporations put addictive substances in candy, sodas & chips - - - of course they're in our cat treats.  And, seriously....they've hit the kitty crack jackpot w/ these.  Do yourself & your cat a favor:  Save your mental & your cat's physical HEALTH.

review/summary: Hairball reducer AND soft fur all in one!
review/text: My 13 year old cat has never liked cat treats.  I have tried a variety over the years, and she wouldn't have anything to do with them.  Until I found this one.  I was really happy to finally find something to reward her, or get her to come to me when called.  These treats have petroleum in them.  My cat loves Vaseline, so it makes sense that she likes these.  I have noticed a decrease in the frequency of her throwing up.  The great surprise that I found is that her fur has become softer!  I know it must be the petroleum in these that is coating her fur as well.  I have to feed her a special cat food because she has a tendancy towards the urinary tract infection, and since I have been doing that, her fur has been more coarse and dry.  These treats have brought back the softness to her fur.  I'm sold, and I will be buying these from now one.  My very picky cat loves them!

review/summary: This must be crack for cats
review/text: My four cats adore this.  They split one bag every night.  I mistakenly gave some  to a stray cat that I feed and he would not leave the deck until I gave him a whole bag.  My mother's cat is also addicted and requires a hand full every day.  She stares pointedly between my mother and her food bowl until she gets enough.<br /><br />Since one my cats has some dental problems this cat food is great as a treat that is good for them.

review/text: With other treats, my cats eat a few and then they've had enough. With these treats, they'd eat the entire bag and more in one sitting, if given the chance! My female will stare at or attempt to get into the drawer where I store them. I can't feed them to my male with my fingers because he gets so excited he tries to eat my finger, too. These are definitely a favorite.

I give about 5-6 of these to my cats every day and they gobble them right up.  Leaves their breath 'better' than normal (not like they've just brushed or anything) and they never leave any behind.

review/summary: All 5 of my Cats go CRAZY for these!
review/text: These are truly temptations for our cats and will have them running from any side of the house.  When you open the bag, they actually smell like "french fries" (two of us confirm this) so the smell from the human side is not bad.  We have tried so many other treats but the Whiskas Temptations Chicken flavor are definitely a favorite.<br /><br />They can put weight on your cat quickly and certainly are not meant to be a diet.  But for treats, they are great and our cats really love them.  If our 5 love them, the chances are high that your cats will love them too!

review/text: I was purchasing my cat other treats until I came upon this one. Ever since he tried he couldn't stop. He doesn't want any other kind of treats but the Creamy Dairy flavor ones. Acutally, when he was inside his mother, she ate them while she was pregnant, don't know if it had anything to do with it but cats love these! They should start making gigantic bags of these. I pretty much have to buy them by the dozen for my spoiled rotten cat.

review/text: I've been giving these to my 2 cats everyday after I give them wet food so that their teeth can be somewhat cleaned afterwards. They love the flavor, though after such a long time they're growing weary of the taste. It's well known that cats who eat too much wet food without eating anything crunchy after are prone to tooth decay. This is just one product that can help cut down on long-term dental health issues with your feline.<br /><br />The only downside to this product is that it only comes in 1 flavor; my cats want variety. Do yours?

HOWEVER these treats are very small and when you have a 17lb large cat he doesn't have to chew them... he just swallows them whole. Therefore they aren't working on the teeth. Fun treat but not going to work for his breath. Will have to find something else.

They do not beg for them,,,, but they do like them!<br /><br />I feed them each 10 treats at home at a time, the suggested ammount and of course they could go for more (because it is a snack)...<br /><br />I love that these taste good to the cats but they are also very healthy!!!!<br /><br />I have 7 cats. One of my cats will only eat 4-5 treats and she gets FULL easy and the rest can eat ALL that I put down........ My neighbor sais that her cats do not like them because they are spoiled on "people food"... I was shocked when she returned the bag I sent them for Christmas!<br /><br />I tried to get them to eat them also and they walked away, tried to also put one in there mouth...<br /><br />I also have 35 cats in our shelter and they ALL love these treats, they will eat as many as you give them.... We cannot afford to buy these for them all the time but we get it for them every few months.. We keep them all the time for our own cats!<br /><br />They are a great product, I like to buy the large bags because you are saving money!

review/summary: My cat's favorite treat
review/text: I have three rescued cats and feed them regular food of course but when they want a treat they will only eat the Whiskas Savory Salmon. I have tried more expensive treats and pretty near every type and brand. They will only come for Whiskas Savory Salmon.  They rate it a five star treat!

review/summary: Made my cat sick
review/text: My cat had a very bad reaction to these treats. He loved them, but they were like an extreme laxative. It took me a while to track down his problem. Maybe it was the chlorophyll, I don't know, but if your cat has a sensitive stomach, I'd be careful with these particular treats.

review/summary: Why can't I buy these in Canada!?
review/text: I bought these when I was in the States (I live in Canada), and now my cat has a monkey on his back...and I can't buy them here! :(  And not only can I not buy them in Canada, I can't even order them on Amazon for reasons I don't fully understand. What am I going to do? His Royal Majesty (I mean the cat, of course) MUST have his Catnip Temptations! He's addicted. I can't drive down there in the winter when the roads are bad (like right now). He doesn't forget about them. It doesn't matter if I hide them. He knows. He watches me. He watches everyone who he thinks might give him his treats. I'm down to the last bag. I need...I need a Catnip Temptations dealer. Or I need to send him to Catnip Temptations Rehab.

review/summary: My cat loves it.. I don't know if I do.
review/text: Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running. I'm thinking he could smell it from across the room. I gave him one and it disappeared instantly, and he looked up right away and begged for more. I gave him a few more and put it away but he would not stop begging until I gave him more. One more, that's it. I put it away again and my cat got all feisty and testy with me. He started biting my empty fingers until I gave in again!<br /><br />I don't really like how it unleashes the BEAST in my sweet cat, but I can tell he loves it. It's like a drug even! With that said, I don't think I'll buy another pack for him. He loved his old treats but it never made him go crazy. There must be some kind of MSG-equivalent in these treats that makes them beg for more. I've never seen him act so ravenous after getting a treat.

review/text: I have many different flavors of these treats for my cats. They like this flavor, but something tells me they like the animal flavors better, whether it is fish or mammals. Don't get me wrong they love this flavor, but I don't think it is the best flavor you can buy.<br /><br />Temptations is most likely the best treat brand you can buy though, they never fail. Just shake the bag, and look, I have cats!

review/text: I didn't have very high expectations for these treats when I first bought them - we were just out of their other treats and I thought I'd give these a shot. Not only do our cats love them, but we've seen a huge difference in the amount of hairballs from our two furballs. We used to have hairball messes to deal with many times a week, and now it's down to just a few a month. I've now put these on our Subscribe & Save list to make sure we never run out. I love that I am giving them something they love that also happens to be so good for their insides. And as a huge bonus, we have a lot fewer messes to clean up/step in. We all win!

review/summary: Kitty Crack
review/text: All three of my cats are crazy about these.  They like the salmon and tuna flavors best. They all beg for them in one way or another.  One cat will sit and stare at me and if that doesn't work, he'll curl up on my shoulder and purr as loud as he can. Another one of my cats just bops me with his paw to let me know he wants treats.  The more I ignore him, the harder he hits me.  I eventually have to tell him no, because I don't want to overdo it with the treats. Anyway, they all love them and I've noticed silkier coats since adding these to their diet.

I'm sure that giving them different flavors means more to me, than it does to my cats; they don't seem to chew them long enough to taste them.  But they insist on two or three each time they come in the house, I'm sure it's a form of addiction.  I'm buying these on the "Subscribe & Save" program, which save money and time compared to buying them locally.<br /><br />Cats love these things!

review/summary: Whiskas Temptations Hairball Control Chicken Flavour Treats for Cat
review/text: With four cats in the household hairballs are a given. It got to be an almost daily routine to hear and see one or more of them gagging and coughing, trying to get rid of a build up of hair in their system. Why their digestive tracts haven't evolved to handle this problem over thousands of years mystifies me. Not only do they groom themselves, they also groom each other.<br /><br />We've tried several different products to try to alleviate this problem and nothing helped. Then we came across the Temptations treats. They have helped considerably. The cats seem to relish them, not knowing they're being given "medicine". Whilst the treats haven't completely ended the hairball issue they have been a great help. Now, it can be weeks if not months without any hairballs.<br /><br />If your cats have a problem with hairballs then give this product a try.<br /><br />Also, with Amazon's Subscribe and Save you'll save money.

review/summary: All your favorite candy bars in one place!
review/text: There's not a lot you can say about this: it's several of the most popular chocolate candy bars and they are, of course, delicious.<br /><br />I bought two of these bags for the office candy dish, and couldn't be more pleased. The bag contains Reese's, Almond Joy, Twix, KitKat, Snickers, Milky Way, M&M's, Peanut M&M's and possibly others. They appear to be more or less evenly distributed: it's not one of those bags with just one Almond Joy and two KitKats and the rest Crunch. You know how THAT goes in the office. Oh yes. Everyone takes the good stuff and in two days you're left with a candy dish full of nothing but Crunch bars when what you really want is just one Twix or even a Snickers, and you CRY to the HEAVENS, "WHY? WHY IS THERE ONLY CRUNCH?" as the thunder of the gods mocks you in your pain.<br /><br />Nope, not like that at all. Very good selection.<br /><br />The only downside is that all the Reese's peanut butter cups are pretty squashed. They still taste fine, but they seem to not weather shipping very well in these bags, so when you open one, expect chocolate shrapnel.<br /><br />Good product for the price. Got this through Amazon Prime, so it was fulfilled by Amazon and shipped quickly. Would definitely order again in this manner.

review/summary: Probably better off just buying at Walmart
review/text: I purchased these for Halloween this year.  Most of the candy in the package was melted.  It had to have sat somewhere pretty warm for them to be as bad as they were.<br /><br />All the candy has 2012 expiration dates, so it isn't old.  It is just too bad that it was delivered in such poor condition. It will due, but I expected better.<br /><br />Candy count:<br /><br />Snickers: 41<br />Twix: 29<br />Crunch: 20<br />Plain M&M's: 16<br />Milky Way: 15<br />Almond Joy: 14<br />Kit Kat: 14<br />Peanut M&M's: 9<br />Reese's Peanut-butter cups: 6 ... (6? Really?  Weak.)<br /><br />Total: 164 - a bit more than 150, but the melted condition kills it for me.

review/text: I was very disappointed with this order because no where on the description did it say that these were mini candy bars. If you don't want mini's DO NOT BY THIS PACKAGE!!!! Now I have to spend more money because it would cost a ton of money to send these back and I'm not going to give out mini's to trick or treaters.

review/text: We were very disappointed with the variety of chocolates in this bag.  The bag lists 9 different bars, but most of them were Nestle Crunch (100 out of 150 of the pieces).  We got very few of some of the other varieties, and we got ZERO Kit Kats, as were supposed to be included.  Also, the weight of the bag is 5 pounds.  Many of the candy bars were squashed.

review/text: My only gripe is it did not come vacuum sealed or with a safety seal.<br />Not that I think any one can mess with popcorn, BUT, the lid is large, so I put the jar on its side (I tilted it while opening) and popcorn came spilling out all over the floor.<br />Almost every kernel pops. Overall, a very good product, but only as exciting as, well, popcorn can get.

review/summary: Best popcorn Ever! Two thumbs way up
review/text: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GPQOFO">India Tree Paloma de Colores Popcorn, 3.4  lb</a> is just great. My wife and I purchased this as an alternative to microwave popcorn when we heard about all the chemicals present that were in microwave popcorn. Very few unpopped kernels and excelent flavor. And yes the differnet colored popcorn tasted differnet and have a slightly different shade once popped (still white). We ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IUWA">Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper</a> to pop the popcorn. This product is also very good. Our 2yr old daugher loves making popcorn this way because she can watch. The only drawback to this method - VERY NOISY. My wife and I cant make popcorn for our evening movie because this wakes our daughter up. But all things considered. It is worth it.

review/summary: Oh, Planters...
review/text: Planters is a name I grew up with and really adore in the same way the kid in me still smiles when I see the golden arches.  However, they have a problem: salt.  Many of their products overdo it, and this is no exception.  It is not the worst offender either, though.  The cashews largely survived the journey to my home intact and it took a good bit of munching to get down to the cashew flavored salt crumbles at the bottom.<br /><br />If you love cashews, you'll love these.  The fact that salt is the only thing I can complain about is really a testament to how good this ever-present brand still is.  Grab your top hat and cane and enjoy a canister.

review/summary: Disappointing Quality
review/text: I thought I'd give these Planters cashews a try, after buying from a nut specialty site for years. Planters are much cheaper (about $7/lb base price, compared to about $8.75/lb from my usual site). They were also smaller. Since they were only advertised as "whole" I guess the size would not be a mischaracterization. However, many of the nuts were broken, so the description of "whole" was certainly  a mischaracterization.  They are more lightly salted than most nuts we are used to in the US.  Lower sodium intake is a worthy health goal, but not my personal taste preference, whether or not the salt is "sea". All-in-all  the  "deluxe"  description seems quite a stretch<br /><br />Bottom line, a good buy if price is the overriding goal.

review/summary: Well Worth the Money
review/text: Great product if you're a cashew lover like me. No, these are not the colossal imported cashews that normally sell for $15 a pound. The description of this product says 'whole cashews', in fact only about 75% are whole the remainder are halves and pieces. For snacking or cooking they're great. Not too salty (sea salt). WELL worth the price, especially if you order on the subscription plan. I don't think you can find a better product at a lower price. These are factory sealed containers from 'Planter's', not repackaged from bulk.

review/text: Disappointed in this purchase. The product is advertised as whole cashews, but I still got a lot of bits and pieces. Maybe they got broken in shipping? Also, the whole nuts seem smaller than the whole roasted cashews that Costco sells for about the same price. Finally, the Planters cashews are noticably saltier than the Costco cashews. I'm not opposed to salt for health reasons, but that much salt does mask the natural taste of the nuts (and taste is why I bought cashews instead of peanuts).
