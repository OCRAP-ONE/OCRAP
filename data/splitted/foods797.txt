review/text: Just purchased these last week. I have a very picky pup (beagle) and two not so picky (beagle-terrier and puggle), they loved them!!! I have never seen my beagle get so excited over a tiny treat. The price at the stores can be a bit high so keep your eyes out for sales or online bargains.

review/summary: Tastes pretty good but not good for me
review/text: I keep looking for healthy snacks for myself and my family.  These had good reviews so I bought them.  I will not buy them again.  Too much sugar is the main reason.  However, the mango is pretty skimpy in them as well.  They do taste pretty good, almost a bar of sweetened coconut.  My husband, who is a lean high energy outdoor man will get a boost of energy from one of these bars when hiking.  I have diabetes and all this bar would do for me is send my blood sugar soaring.  Since the same company and others offer other bars with much less sugar I will buy them instead.  They will meet both of our needs for a tasty, healthy snack better than these do.

review/summary: Incredible!
review/text: First, yes I know this is waaaay too much to pay for any balsamic, especially for a bottle this small. I bought 2 bottles when they were on sale at woot.com and even then it seemed like the price was crazy, but I went for it anyway.<br /><br />If you can stomach the price, holy crap, this is the most amazing balsamic vinegar I've ever tasted. It's thick, but not quite a glaze. The flavor is rich and sweet, although it has 6% minimum acidity like any other balsamic, it doesn't taste tart or acidic. I could eat it by the teaspoon! I just wish you could buy it by the gallon.

review/text: I use this vinegar cooking vegetables and meats.  It is so concentrated that only a small drop or two is required for a great burst of flavor. It is absolutely "bite free" and is by far the smoothest and best tasting vinegar that I have ever used. I average a bottle every six months or so.  It is expensive but goes a very long way when you use it.  I highly recommend it.

review/text: Little guy's allergic to dairy and soy so we had him on Nutramigen AA.  Nutramigen AA works well but is very expensive and he doesn't really care for it so when I saw a can of this for sale at a more affordable price on Amazon, we tried it.  He seems to prefer the flavor, which is great, and it definitely works as we had no blood-filled diapers later.  Unfortunately, something about this formula just doesn't sit well with him and he spits tons of it up every time; I'm not really sure he's getting any nutrition from it at all.  Definitely not something I'll reorder.

review/summary: Tasty popcorn that doesn't get stuck between your teeth!
review/text: Okay, maybe the heading exagerates just a tad... Red Popcorn has a MUCH more tender husk than regular popcorn does and when it pops, it explodes the kernel so well that the husks basically disappear.  When it pops, it looks pretty much like any other popcorn, except that the popped kernels are slightly smaller than usual.  The meet is white, but you can see the little bits of red kernel in them.  You would never know that the pretty, white popcorn you were eating started out red-colored if you hadn't seen it before popping.<br /><br />The flavor is great!  It smelled "toastier" as it was popping than other popcorns we've tried.  We tried it all different ways, with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good.<br /><br />We also liked the fact that it is grown by Amish people and are happy to support their efforts to raise their crops the "old way."  They believe in sustainable farming and a clean, wholesome way of life.  No ConAgra multi-national conglomerates here, just real, individual farmers making a living off their land.<br /><br />Great products raised and produced by real farmers.  What better reasons do you need to buy some of this really tasty popcorn!?

review/text: I just want to point out that this is not actually "Amish" popcorn.  Look at the company's website-this is "Amish country" popcorn, meaning I guess that Amish live in the vincinity.  Note the lack of any mention of organic popcorn on it.  This is good popcorn, but don't fool yourself into thinking you're getting an organic/chemical free product, or one raised in small batches by Amish folk.  Clever wording strikes again!

review/summary: We hate to leave this kind of review......
review/text: We hate to leave this kind of review especially when we have enjoyed this product so much in the past.  Purchased this item in June 2011 and placed it in our kitchen cupboard upon arrival.  Two weeks ago, we were watching a movie and decided to have some popcorn.  Grabbed the new bag of Wabash (purple) and opened it.  Moths came flying out of the bag.  Yes, moths!!  Quickly closed the bag and to our dismay saw many, many moths crawling around inside the bag.  Did some internet research and found the moths are called Indian Meal Moths.  We have never seen these critters in our kitchen before and are sure they came with the popcorn.  We did a complete clean out of our cupboards and have not found them in any other products.  We wrote an email to Wabash Valley thru Amazon about this incident two weeks ago and have heard nothing back.  We would have thought they would pony up and at least offer an apology, if not a complete refund.  We realize that this kind of thing happens and are saddened by their lack of response and responsibility.  It's just not good business.  They have our money after all.

All of them popped and the crunch was tender, yet crisp. All I did was toss on a little popcorn salt and I'm not sure it even needed that. I've never had popcorn so good! This is worth a try!

review/text: This is by far my favorite popcorn of all time. Petite, fluffy kernels are delicious and light as air. I pop this several times a week in my Back to Basics popper. One thing to keep in mind: the kernels pop up quite a bit smaller than ordinary corn, so you should measure out more, to fill up the popper. For instance, normally I measure out nearly a half-cup of ordinary corn, but for the Vintage Red I usually use almost 3/4 cup. Happy popping!

After eating the Vintage Red, regular popcorn seems kind of like styrofoam. The only thing I noticed that you need to watch for is that with some of the gourmet popcorns, shipping is more expensive than the popcorn itself.

review/summary: Ok, but will look for something better
review/text: This popping corn is a mix of pros and cons for us.  It came in a clear plastic bag with the pretty red label.  Very colorful corn - lots of dark red with a few kernels of white mixed in.  As some of the other reviewers have said, for a hot air popper, you'll definitely want to tip the popper backward the minute you plug it in or else the air pressure will send kernels flying around your kitchen like schrapnel.  Trust me - you'll be ducking for cover and then finding kernels for the next year or so.  I did not let go of my hot air popper until there was a good amount of popped corn to weigh down the unpopped kernels.  These kernels are noticeably smaller than others you'll see in the grocery store so when they pop, the end result is smaller.  If you have shag carpet, this is probably not a good thing.  The husks are softer and tend to cause less damage to your gums if they get caughtin your teeth, though it won't happen often.  The cost for this little bag is also significantly higher than we'd want to pay again.  Another big con for us is the number of unpopped kernels that remain - probably 1 - 2 dozen per 1/2 cup batch.  For the cost, that's too much.  We'll be trying something else next time.

review/summary: Too Tough and Almost Tastless
review/text: I didn't like the Amish Red Popcorn at all.  98% of it did not pop in a hot air popper. What little that popped was too tough and almost tasteless.  I dumped it and bought Orville Redenbacher White Corn Gourmet. It was the kind of popcorn I love, and over 98% of it popped in the hot air popper.  I'll stick with Orville.

review/summary: Seems average in taste, possibly not compatible with all hot air poppers
review/text: I purchased this popcorn along with a top rated hot air popper. I believe that because the kernels are smaller and lighter, if your hot air popper has a lot of power, be prepared to have the kernels fly all over until the point they start to pop. The popped kernels are definitely smaller than normal popcorn and frankly, I  do not find the popcorn fluffier or less "husky". In fact, I am fighting the urge to pick my teeth as I write! All of this may be due to the fact that I am using a hot air popper. It is nice to know the corn is organic, but I am a little mad at myself for purchasing a 10 year supply! ;)

review/summary: Very Tasty
review/text: I was looking for a hulless popcorn (due to my diverticulitis, boy do I miss popcorn) and tried this based on the reviews. I was disappointed that this has way to many hulls for ME (the hulls do not disappear or get so small) but the flavor of the popcorn is amazing, very very tasty, my family loves it so I will buy it again.  We air popped it, sprayed it with a little cooking oil and sprinkled some popcorn flavored seasoning "butter."  Hardly any calories but lots of taste :) They are tiny when they pop so you really should not flood it with anything heavy or it will turn to mush.

review/text: I started ordering popcorn from Amazon because out local grocery stores only sell one brand of regular popcorn. Most of the popcorn they sell is microwave. Since there is only one to buy, there is no comparison price shopping and the stores seem to be taking advantage of this. This was very tasty popcorn. I tried many of the different Amish Country Brand popcorns. This was by far the best. The price is very reasonable even taking shipping into consideration.

I take half a can, mix it with a little organic salsa, top it with organic cheese, and heat it through until the cheese melts.  It's pretty tasty, and it makes a complete protein if you pair it with a side of rice.

Sometimes instead of or in addition to the corn, I add some cooked vegetables or some cut up chicken or turkey - it makes for a hearty, very healthy meal!!

I like to add sour cream or salsa and heat in a pan on the stove.  If you are willing to ADD to the product, I think you will like it.  It makes me sad to see low ratings because they don't like the "look" of it coming out of the can or because it lacks extra salt ect...  All I know is that I will continue to buy this- hope this helped someone.

They're not exactly bad, but there are so many other choices, including organic varieties, that are so much better. As you might expect from "beans, water, salt" these are pretty bland. But they don't really even have a strong pinto bean flavor either. And the texture is really off - very dry and a grainy feel. No matter how I doctor these up, they just don't cut it.

Though some are better than others, they all share something this product doesn't have: whole or parts of pinto beans. Plus a certain darkness of color suggests that they are indeed pinto beans and are refried. This product is a very pale paste.<br />Refried Pinto Beans ... Not

Refer to the Environmental Working Group report on BPA.<br /><br />I consume olives and these are not large at all. 110 MG sodium for 3 olives are too much so I rinsed these Lindsay olives real well, then placed it in a container with Serrano pepper, garlic, spices and a real good vinegar from Italy, and placed it in refrigerator just like I do with all other brands. These are tasteless compare to other brands I get from Spain. It is pitted which is great but not a strong olive taste at all. Coopolvia Olives are much stronger tasty olives for the same price but regardless you still get that in a can with BPA.

I gave two friends from Jamaica a few ounces to try and they were calling me after they used it for more or to know where they could get it.  I would stock up whenever I was Orlando, but I wasn't getting back there anytime soon so I decided in April 2010 to check online and there it was; I immediately purchased (4) 22oz bottles. My friends were quite surprised when I gave each of them a 22oz bottle. They are now calling me for their mothers and friends, I'm now the curry pusher. I finally gave up my pusher status and told them to check on Amazon. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D71GSC">JCS Hot Jamaican Curry Powder, 22oz</a> has certainly spiced up my life; it's helped me win friends and influence people.

The taste is very interesting, it tastes like your typical sweet tea, but then out of nowhere you get hit by the "special ingredient" that many claim tastes like a cannabis.  I don't have experience with it so I can't testify if it does or not, but some people who've tried them mostly say it has a very "earthy" taste.  Regardless of that these are fantastic drinks and are always the talk of a party.  However, I don't see them ever catching on in America due to the giant weed leaf on the can.

review/text: I use a lot of lemon juice - for coating bananas, potatoes and apples before dehydrating (it keeps them from turning brown), in seltzer water as a beverage, sprinkled on cooked spinach and collard greens, and on chili as a condiment.<br /><br />This brand is every bit as good as RealLemon, taste-wise.  It's tart and lemony, but not bitter.  Having 12 bottles delivered free (with Amazon SuperSaver Shipping for orders over $25) is convenient and easy for me.  I chose "supscribe and save" option and saved an additional 15% on the price.  This makes it the same price as store brand lemon juice.<br /><br />The only criticism I have of this juice is that the bottles have screw-off lids and not flip-tops.  That's not a big deal, but it does mean I need two hands to use it.  Edited to add:  I discovered that the flip-top lids from RealLemon juice bottles also fit on these bottles.  It's so much easier to flip the top to pour and not have to set everything down to use two hands!<br /><br />Edited March 2012 to add:  I bought this product for $17-something the first two times.  I was just notified by Amazon that my latest automatic shipment would cost $27, so I cancelled it.  It's good lemon juice, but not THAT good.

Sooooo enstead of using gallons of extra water to rinse the body wash off just take a half cup of Lemon Juice to a gallon of water and the refreshing feeling has cleaned you off soap free. Alittle more water rinses off the lemon juice and you are a happy person. So at less than $2 a 32 oz. bottle (and you get 12 bottles for under 18 bucks) I say I should be happy the rest of the summer. Lemon juice smells great too! I love this stuff.

Very disappointed because I think the manufacturer left their own product review just to off load carppy lot/batch of kool aid.

review/summary: OK but Black Cherry and Berry Cherry are better.
review/text: My gf and I did a taste test of this, Kool-Aid Twists Blastin' Berry Cherry Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZED2M">Kool-Aid Twists Blastin' Berry Cherry Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix, 0.17-Ounce Packets (Pack of 96)</a>), and Kool-Aid Black Cherry Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZLVE0">Kool-Aid Black Cherry Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix, 0.13-Ounce Packets (Pack of 96)</a>).<br /><br />The Black Cherry has the richest dark color followed by Berry Cherry. We found it hard to pick a favorite flavor between those two as they are both good. I preferred the Black Cherry while my gf preferred the Blastin' Berry Cherry. We will probably alternate the two. The regular Cherry has the lightest color and does not taste as good as the other two.<br /><br />We use the Splenda packets so there are hardly any calories (Splenda has 3.5 calories per packet but it can be labeled as 0 calories since it is under 5). Splenda tastes just like sugar with no bad aftertaste. We have changed to using slightly less than 8 cups of water to make the taste richer. We have also increased the Splenda to 12 packets to make it sweeter.

review/summary: Dog Approved!
review/text: I received a Kyjen Tennis Slider to review, and at first I was skeptical. It seemed flimsy and gimmicky. My two dogs changed my mind, and a friend's dog has also tried it and given her approval too! All three dogs thoroughly enjoyed learning to move the individual flaps of the puzzle toy to release one and then both tennis balls, and then moving the center piece to slide up or down, revealing treats! All of the dogs figured the puzzle out within minutes, and each has their own style. My Rott paws it open, bashing it with his giant paws. My Lab nosed it for a while, then picked it up and tossed it. My friend's Terrier mix nosed it open. This is a great way to keep the dogs thinking and to give an outlet for some mental energy. I thought it was flimsy, but so far even with the abuse dished out by close to 200 lbs of dog so far, it only has a few minor scratches, so I would say it is holding up nicely!<br /><br />The bad: the dogs solve it too quickly, and there is no way to make it harder. Additionally, I am not sure how it will hold up in the long term, but I will let you know!<br /><br />Feel free to read the entire review at: [...]

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: This was a great treat. I got it as a gift for family with two young labs and it was so interesting for all of us to see how interested they were. The more 'biddable' bitch was attracted, but the more 'rambunctious' male stayed nosing and chewing at different angles until he discovered how to lift the cups and get to the treats inside. He quickly became an expert and was easily lifting and dropping the cups, while his friend stayed close and occasionally sneaked a treat out before her could get to it. Don't leave the dogs to play with the cups, or they'll chew them out of shape and they won't lift out as easily. Great fun and gave us a better understanding of the dogs.

review/text: This game was great...for about 3 days.  My 7-month old lab mix spent a lot of energy (yay!) figuring out how to get the treats.  Unfortunately after about 3 tries, he had it totally mastered.  Even tightening it up to the max was still too easy.  It also completely broke after about the 5th use.  Might be great if your dog is smaller or less energetic.

review/summary: Cut my dog's mouth :-(
review/text: As a previous reviewer stated, the wells for the treats in this game were too narrow and deep for my dog's nose/mouth to reach the treat. The very first time she tried it she cut her mouth on the plastic edges and started bleeding.  I didn't think this would happen as she isn't a large dog with a big snout (30 lb. Cocker Spaniel mix) - her snout is longer and thinner than an average Cocker. It would have helped to know the size of the treat compartments to have an idea of the size before I purchased this. I measured it myself and it is about 1.5" deep, 2 1/8" wide and 2 1/4" long. Seems big enough, but it wasn't. Additionally, only 1 of the 3 yellow compartment covers that are meant to flip up to expose the treat actually stay up long enough to allow a few seconds for the dog to get the treat. The other 2 fall down right away on top of the dog's face which could result in more cuts to the eyes or other parts of the face. I was disappointed because my dog was excited to play and find the treats, but I couldn't let it continue with her being cut. Good game concept, but edges of the toy need to be more smooth and rounded. I am returning this tomorrow.

review/summary: Good for long toungues or really small faces
review/text: Even though this appears to be intended for dogs, I bought this for my cat Digby. He is very smart and likes puzzle toys (the ones that conceal treats of course). The problem with this toy is the depth of the 'bowls' that hold the treats. Digby cannot get his snout deep enough into the bowls to get the food. I could see a large dog with a big toungue being able to do it, but not a small dog or a cat. This is too bad because it looks like someone put some thought into this thing, they just perhaps only had one size animal in mind when they designed it. If your pet can lick the inside bottom of a jelly jar, perhaps this will be a good item to get them.

I had to put a leather boot string in the yellow cups for easy removal, otherwise it was nearly impossible to lift off.

review/summary: Great for slowing down feeding time!
review/text: This is a super easy puzzle it took my standard poodle who is about 6 months old about 3 minutes to figure it out the very first time. So I don't think it makes the best puzzle, but it is amazing at slowing down chow time.  I fill all four compartments up with kibble.  I holds about 2 cups of food, and it extends eating time from 2 minutes to 10 minutes.  Which means less gas for my dog and sweeter air for me.

This would be a great tool though for using at feeding time if you have a dog that you need to slow down.  It is easily washable.  The cups will break if chewed on, but they're not intended to be chew toys.

review/summary: Two paws down
review/text: My ten pound Yorkie is very food centric when it comes to games - if there isn't food, he isn't playing.  We have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him.  The yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders.  For a dog that LOVES any game that involves food, this just proved much too frustrating for him. And believe me, we tried to help our little guy out with this. We left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel, but even that was too difficult for him to "spin" as it did not move easily.  And it's not like our dog isn't "Paw-centric" as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his Kong, and to fish treats out from under furniture, etc.  We tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy, but all parties finally agreed that this just wasn't fun the way a toy should be. Perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you, but it received two paws down from our little buddy.<br /><br />One other concern that I had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw. Granted that on one should ever leave a pet and a toy unattended, but something for people to keep in mind if they do buy this product. (yes I'm a worry wart pet parent, but you'd be amazed at the predicaments our pets have gotten themselves into...)

We just have to watch she doesn't try to eat the yellow cups but the blue part is durable.  She easily figured out, tho, that she can move it around instead of spinning the disc to get the treats out.  She knows where we store this game and tries to get into the cabinet to get it out!  Great price at Amazon and a good value dog toy.  I would buy this again.

review/summary: Star Spinner Treat Game A Hit
review/text: I have two dogs that received this gift from Santa and figured it out pretty quick since Santa pre-filled it. They play with it until it is empty... as most dogs would, I suspect, since they can smell the food inside. They seem to really enjoy it. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it needs really small bits of food/treats and is not so easy to fill. I end up with quite a bit of food on the floor while trying to fill it. I might try to find some really small cookies to put inside to cut down on the frustration of filling it. My dogs like it though and that is all that matters to me!

review/text: My two year old Havapoo (half Havanese, half Poodle) loves this toy! She is food motivated and she is smart so I thought this would be a good challenge for her. It took her five minutes to figure out how to remove the yellow cup. In the beginning, she was pawing at it. Finally she figured out a way to remove the cup with her mouth. Within ten minutes she was able to find all the hidden treats. After this exercise, she was a bit tired from all the mental stimulation, she took a nap for a couple hours. LOL. It was just the right level of difficulty for her. There was a tiny bit of frustration but any more frustration, she would have given up. Now, this is the only way she has dinner. She is getting more and more efficient at removing the cups. I didn't know if this would be too big for her mouth, but she has no problems. This is a great toy and a fun way to keep your dog stimulated and active.

review/summary: Love it!!
review/text: I'm happy to say that all three of my dogs had no issue with the yellow covers cracking. They are hard plastic, but they are fairly thick and don't give even to a hard squeeze. My dogs all realized that the object was to get the covers out of the way, not to chew on them, so that may be the issue. My 4-month-old German Shepherd figured this out very quickly and even put the little covers back on after all the treats were gone, as if she expected them to refill magically, lol! It took my 3-year-old golden retriever a bit more time to figure out and she used her paws quite a bit whereas the puppy was all teeth. It was very interesting to see them try different ways of figuring out the puzzle. However, my 3-year-old malamute is kind of a baby and he tried very briefly before he looked at me and started to whine. Clearly it's not as much fun for a furbaby who is used to having everything handed to him! My girls still get very excited every time we pull this out though. We always use a high value treat in the puzzle, something special that they don't get every day. They will play the game over and over and over as many times as I refill it. I definitely think this is something most dogs can do on their own if you need to keep them busy for 10-15 minutes but my girls seems to enjoy it even more when I'm there cheering them on every time they have a success. The materials are very durable, in my opinion, and clean up couldn't be easier. The holes are very easy to wipe clean and a quick rinse under the faucet for the rest is generally all I need to do for the rest. Wonderful toy at a great price if you have highly intelligent dogs who get bored easily!

review/summary: Good fun, but too easy
review/text: We have a 16 week Cocker Spaniel-Australian Shepherd mix (~20 lbs). We got this toy for him when he was only around 10 weeks old.  It was challenging for him the first time.  When we gave it to him the next day, he knew exactly what he was doing and got all the treats out within two minutes.  We even timed it.  Now, as soon as we set it on the floor, it takes only a few seconds for him to get each compartment open, and we don't give it to him very often.  It's a cute/fun way to deliver some treats, but it's not long before he's looking at us like, "Okay, now what?  What's next??"<br /><br />Pros: Opens easily so it's not too frustrating.  The star design makes compartments a bit more challenging if the treats are pushed further inside.  You can put a dab of peanut butter in a few, and it will take him longer to lick it out, but you might have to clean it after.  The grips on the underside really help hold it in place so that he doesn't slide it around the floor too far or too quickly. It has withstood his strong bite/chewing. It is rare that he flips it over, too, so it's weighted well.<br /><br />Cons: Too easy, finished with it and bored within a minute, if not a few seconds.

review/summary: Does not challenge puppy at all, but fun way to feed him
review/text: This product was way to easy for our 4 month old pup Raisin. The compartments opened up very easily with each nudge. It does serve well as a puppy food/snack bowl if your pup eats too fast - making him move from compartment to compartment to eat will slow him down. Not great for trying to improve or test your puppy's IQ, but a fun way to feed him.

review/summary: Keeps the puppy entertained
review/text: Good concept to keep our puppy entertained.  Quality is alright, but we do not leave it out for her, as she can easily chew the plastic apart.

review/summary: Dog's Completely Enjoy This Toy!
review/text: This dog toy puzzle comes assembled (which I completely appreciated) and was easy and straight forward to set up for our two dogs. It truly put our Rottweiler's problem solving skills to the test and proved to be quite interactive and entertaining for our German Shepard. Colorful and easy to store, the Star Spinner has been a good addition to our household.<br /><br />This is a social writeup!

review/summary: My Dog gave it 2 paws up :)
review/text: My Large Shepard/Chow/Collie Mix is very smart and easily bored. Lets just say he can disembowel a stuffed toy in seconds. Anywhoo, we needed to find a toy that at least challenges him a little bit. The Paw puzzle was fun for him and my family to use. He's definitely food motivated so this was a perfect fit. At first he was laying down while trying to lift up the cups and he couldn't get them up. So i was a little worried they might be a little to smooth for him to lift up but then he stood and gripped the cup in his teeth and pulled it up. He now has the hang of it and can find all the treats in no time. Its great for training (you add the command find it to your routine and it can become a whole new trick/job for your dog). The only down side I can think of is that it's a bit bulky for a toy (you can't just throw it in a dog toy bin) and that it might get old fast for some dogs or owners to use. My other dog is a Amstaff mix and she showed interest in the treats but no desire to search for them lol. So certain breeds may not think this is the bee's knee's. Its easily cleaned, a nice grade of plastic ( although i worry about the cups cracking). You definitely want to supervise while your dog is having fun with this toy. Other than that its fun, and well worth it.
