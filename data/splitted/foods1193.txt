review/summary: Disappointed!
review/text: If you're just interested in a cup of good coffee, this is fine.  If you really want the taste of pumpkin spice, I would not select this particular brand. I couldn't really taste the pumpkin spice, and that's why I am disappointed. I was torn between giving it a one star or a two star.  I give it a 2 star for decent coffee, but a 1 star for the lack of pumpkin spice flavor.  I based my purchase on other reviews, and am surprised that others really liked it.  I've had pumpkin spice coffee at other places, and this doesn't compare at all. Perhaps I got a bad batch.  Big disappointment!!

review/text: We've tried many Tassimo flavors.  This is by far our favorite.  Our normal cup of coffee is Starbuck's house blend out of a Cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our Tassimo.  This coffee is rich but not too stong.  I don't understand the current price over $20 for 14 disks and hope that it will be lowered on Amazon.  For now, we'll buy elsewhere.

review/summary: great coffee - terrible price
review/text: This is one of the best choices, in my opinion.  I also adore Amazon, but they need to negotiate a better price for their Tassimo Disks.  These are available at BedBath & Beyond for $10. and I always get 20% off which brings it down to $8.00 --- they were $7.50 (before the 20% off readily available coupons) until about 3 months ago.  Again, this is an excellent blend with full flavor - not bitter - I think it's my favorite.

review/summary: One of the better T-Discs
review/text: I have tried about 75% of the available T-Discs, and the Kona Blend is one of the best regular/unflavored coffees for Tassimo. It has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering, and has a pleasant aroma. Personally, I would enjoy it more if it were stronger/bolder. However, being a bit mild, it goes well with breakfast and/or (gluten-free) baked goodies. I find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect, nor is a subscription service available. Originally found this at (Dead Bats from) Beyond, used a 20% coupon, and was happy with the final price.

review/summary: Note: Rating both coffee and seller
review/text: This coffee is good but, for me, it's nothing special. I will buy it again because it's a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it's taking a long time to be delivered (still haven't gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this "Kona coffee" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn't careful. I've bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee. Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15% Kona. And don't expect it to come in a flash, as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it.

review/summary: Good for people with food allergies
review/text: My son has numerous food allergies and we have to be careful about any packaged/processed food as it may have been made on shared equipment with common allergens. This company has been excellent about responding to all of my questions and concerns. They only process fruit in their facility so all of their products are free of the top allergens. Hooray!<br /><br />My toddler son loved the papayas and they are definitely the softest of the varieties that we tried (pineapple, mango and papaya). The pineapple were too hard and crunchy for him but they were very sweet and I enjoyed them. They would be fantastic on an ice cream sundae. The mango were also a little too crunchy for him initially, and yes some bits were even a little sharp. But then I discovered that after about a week of carrying the opened package in a sealed ziploc bag they became softer but not mushy or sticky at all, just about the perfect texture for my son to enjoy. I was impressed that they maintained a decent texture after being opened for that length of time. The Brothers brand freeze dried fruit kind of turns to styrofoam if it's open for more than 24 hours.<br /><br />I also love that this product is organic. I will definitely be purchasing the papaya for my son again.

review/summary: Freeze-dried papaya = yum!
review/text: Crunchy N Yummy freeze dried papaya is one of those things I wish I'd discovered a long time ago. Each bag is only 55 calories for the whole thing! Okay, so it feels a bit expensive--but how much would you pay for fresh papaya at the grocery store? Probably just about the same price.<br /><br />Things to know:<br /><br />-It's not as sweet as a lot of freeze-dried fruits- the mango, for example, is much sweeter. But the mango also has twice the calories.<br /><br />-Papayas are ridiculously healthy fruits, so you're getting a ton of things like Vitamin C and antioxidents, and they have a decent amount of fiber in each cup<br /><br />-This isn't papaya cut neatly into little cubes...it's almost like papaya flakes in some cases. So if you like your fruit perfectly cubed, this is not for you.<br /><br />My kids and I love all the Crunchy N Yummy freeze dried fruit varieties, but I have to hide this and the mango from them so they don't eat it all, they love it so much. Great product- wish this was eligible for Subscribe and Save.

review/summary: Should have listened to the bad reviews
review/text: This product has an appalling taste.  It has the texture of cardboard  and is otherwise bland and vile.<br />I think if there is no added sugar,  the freeze dried form of this fruit is not so appealing.  It's as though all the flavor of the papaya was removed during the drying process.<br /><br />Your first feeling when you put it in your mouth is an overwhelming desire to spit it out.  It's as dry as a potato chip,  but gathers some moisture in your mouth, whereupon the taste hits you,  dirty sock.  Yes it's like stuffing a sock in your mouth.<br /><br />As an experiment I dropped several chips into my dogs bowl.  She wagged her tail eagerly at first, presuming she was getting a treat.  One sniff however disabused her of that notion and she turned away disgusted.  Yup it's that bad,  my dog wouldn't eat it!<br /><br />You get all this for $16?  No thanks.

review/text: If you are one of the beef jerky lovers who really enjoys the soft tangyness of beef jerky that is most resembled in terriaki flavored beef jerky, you should know that it is extremely hard to find such kinds. Sometimes it's just sheer luck that you get a bag of the same texture you want. To me, I felt that this beef jerky wasn't as good as some of them but definitely better than a lot of the main brands out there. This bag, has a LOT of beef jerky, and it is somewhat soft. However, it isn't like chewy/tangy and is still a little dry. Some people like it, but to me the texture is not great. The flavor profile though is delicious.

review/summary: good Amazon value
review/text: whenever Amazon sells Jerky under $1 per ounce, I always like to sample it.  I recall seeing this brand at my local Target over $1.50 per ounce (BTW - Target's $1/oz house brand Pepper Jerky is great).  I tried Wild Ride's Peppered and Hickory, since sweeter flavored Jerky are rarely done right.  Peppered is always a safe flavor to try since few makers can screw that up, and this one did not disappoint - very nice balance of pepper and smoke without downing it in salt.  the Hickory tasted like pickled meat with a strong dill and parsley aftertaste, while being way too salty and moist.  both had about the same gristle percentage than that cheap import Amazon sells from World Kitchens Jerky.  If you like your Jerky drier, just leave it in the fridge in an open bag for a few days.  I'd call the Pepper a 3 star jerky, and the Hickory 2 star jerky, that both earn a bonus star as long as it's available under $1/oz.  One annoying thing about the package - the ingredients list is microscopic - sort of makes you wonder what they are hiding...

review/summary: Could be great, but fell short!
review/text: The flavor of this jerky was good-very sweet which my husband likes. However, the texture varied greatly from melt in your mouth to shoe leather that was almost not chewable. I like a little chewiness, so both textures bothered me.

review/summary: Tender jerky in some bags not others
review/text: I really like the size of the pieces and the tenderness of the jerky I've had so far. I've only had one of the 4 packages that come in an order. I am not thrilled with the Teriyaki flavor but it's ok, not too salty. The sweet hot is really hot so beware. This brand is the first jerky I am willing to re-order, which says a lot. Usually I get grossed out by the amount of sinew in packaged jerky but I have not found much in this brand yet.<br /><br />Updating after opening all 4 bags that came in an order: 3 bags were good but the 4th bag was all gristle and fat. There was not one piece that was edible in it. So they definitely have a quality control problem. Pity, because the good pieces are quite good, though the teriyaki flavor is a bit chemical for me. Still better than most other jerky brands

review/summary: NOT Natural - Contains Nitrites
review/text: While I read here the original flavor was natural, there was no list of ingredients available. And to my disappointment when this arrived it does indeed contain nitrites. The taste is alright, but I really would like to find jerky WITHOUT Nitrites or Nitrates. I've kept it in the fridge now for several months (i haven't had any mold issues) since I truly try to consume nitrites as little as possible, it will take a very long time to eat this or I'll end up trashing it. Please REVISE the description to be accurate! This brand DOES from my understanding have a truly natural version, that I cannot seem to find on Amazon.

review/summary: Salty and dry!
review/text: Compared to Pacific Gold beef jerky, this beef jerky is way too salty! You have to drink a glass of water for every piece of jerky you eat.  It's also a littler drier and less tender than other beef jerky.  I would recommend trying other brands of beef jerky and staying away from this unless you want to develop early high blood pressure.

review/summary: Too much grissle in this jerky
review/text: This is really tasty jerky and the price is right, but ~20-30% of the jerky strips in the bags I purchased contained some sort of "gum-like" inedible grissle that I end up spitting out.  I've bought 2 bags of this product approximately 30 days apart and both were like this.  I'll try one more bag for the reasons I cite above, but if the next one is like the 1st two, I'm going to stop buying this product.  It's a shame, because as I said, it really is tasty.<br /><br />UPDATE FEB 2010<br />OK ... I've kept my monthly subscription to this Jerky ...  What can I say ... Every 2nd or 3rd piece from the bags I've been delivered turns into a gum ball that I'm not willing to swallow, but it is just so darn tasty.  Dunno how long I'll stay with this, but for now ... I sort of look forward to the monthly delivery.

review/text: Like others I ordered this on a lightning deal and it's great value.<br />I gave four stars for flavor and freshness, it IS some of the best jerky I've tasted.<br />I was a little disappointed however, the first bag and first few pieces were moist, soft and really good, then the next couple of pieces were like rawhide, with some obvious jerked gristle, which took some serious chewing, and detracted from the quality of the rest in the bag.<br />I thought this was a one off, but the second and third bag have been the same, mostly soft and satisfying, but about 25% smokey boot leather.<br />I don't know whether it's quality control, but it seems like "pot luck" with what's in the bag.<br />All that said, I haven't had the jaw ache I get from the popular brands so it's still good..........just not perfect.

review/summary: Good price, OK quality
review/text: This jerky tastes okay, but it seems like this isn't made from the best quality meat.  I don't know if I got a bad batch, but all the jerky I ate had hard veins running through them. All in all, I would give 2.5 stars, but since I can't, and I don't like rounding up, I have to go with 2.<br /><br />PROS:<br />The Jerky is tender, but not overly tender.  It is a good consistancy (except for the occassional tough fiber running through them).<br /><br />CONS:<br />The quality of the meat was sub par, which says a lot, since you don't need the best cuts to make jerky (its basically dried ground meat).  As the other reviewers pointed out, the package says the beef could be from USA or from a variety of other countries.  I'm pretty certain mine didn't come from the US.<br /><br />NEUTRAL:<br />The flavor was okay.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either.  There are many other jerkys out there that have outstanding flavor.

review/summary: Good Tasting and Tender, But...
review/text: While "Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips" do have a good Hickory taste and are very tender (per treated), they are also fairly salty and leave a lot of "gristle" in your mouth. I also like that it doesn't have MSG (I'm alergic) but am disapointed that meat likely comes from outside the USA.<br /><br />On taste alone, my family is split on this jerky with 2 of us liking it (me and my son) and two of us not (my wife and daughter). We all like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPDOI">Wild Bill's Hickory Smoked Jerky, 6.5-Ounce Package (Pack of 4)</a>.<br /><br />I will not likely buy this brand again, even if it is on sale.

The flavor though is mediocre at best; poor would be a fair description.<br /><br />Also, if you open the bag it will grow mold in a few days.  Maybe this is a problem with other brands of jerky too.  I wouldn't know because this is the first time I have opened a bag and not eaten it relatively quickly (see above's flavor comments).<br /><br />All in all, this isn't very good jerky.

review/summary: moldy beef jerky
review/text: I have bought from this seller before and had no problems.  This last order I opened before I went on vacation for two weeks.  The texture of the beef jerky was different in this order than the ones that I had bought before.  After returning from vacation, when I opened the package, there was a very non-pleasant odor.  Upon inspecting the jerky, I found that several pieces contained mold on them.  What I have now is over a half pound of very expensive dog treats. While I would be willing to try this product again, as I have bought it before and this is the first problem I have had, there is no easy way of contacting the seller. The product is also listed as non-returnable, so while my dog is extremely happy - I am not.

review/text: This is really good jerky. The pieces are nice and thick and have just enough gristle in it to leave you with something to chew for a while. That's half the reason I like jerky. This actually helps the bag last longer since you don't rush right onto the next piece! It has a barbeque coating with a good flavor and a semi-spicy after bite. The pieces are thick enough that they don't disintegrate in the bag so that the last half of the bag isn't smaller "crumbs". I'd buy this again and as a matter of fact I think I will right now!

If you like a good jerky that you can chew on a while, this isn't it.

Don't listen to the idiots giving this bad reviews, saying that it was stale or moldy.  This is what happens when you leave any kind of jerky out for 2+ weeks people!

Excellent flavor (purchased the hickory, trying original next), and an awesome price for such large qauntity.  It's nice to see actual texture and strip size variations, vs. the new "pressed square beef-like product" now being sold as jerky in many bags.<br /><br />My fiance mentioned upon trying her first piece that it doesn't taste like store-bought.  I recommend this if you're a jerky fanatic struggling to find a good price/quality ratio!

review/summary: Tougher than the back end of a shootin' gallery!
review/text: I'm a self-proclaimed connoisseur of beef jerky, I have probably eaten a wheelbarrow full of different brands. This "Wild Ride" is the toughest cut I have ever come across. You have to chew, chew, chew, and chew! Couple pieces and your jaw is too sore to complain much. No date on the bag, contacted manufacturer by email, thought maybe I got some old stock...no reply. Great taste, but too tough!

review/summary: Very Disappointed!
review/text: I am so disappointed. I also had the mold issue a lot of reviews were talking about. Since I paid for it I found a piece that wasn't touching the mold and tried it. I'm daring I know. The beef jerky was very tender. I know some might like that, but I like it a little rough. That's how beef jerky is supposed to be. The flavor was also really bad, but that is probably from the mold. I think the issue is the moisture. It makes it tender, but it is also leading to the mold issues a lot of people are experiencing. I won't order this brand again, which is a shame because it was a great price for the amount of jerky.

Not tough the way jerky should be, but tough the way a hamburger that gets left on the BBQ for a couple hours is.<br />Very disappointed I couldn't return this because of Amazon policy.

review/summary: Tender as promised, but more salt and gristle than bargained for
review/text: By now I've eaten half the bag so I know what's in here. Sure, their beef jerky is pretty tender. But for some reason they decided to throw in an insane amount of salt. I've had store-bought beef jerky and I've had quality Amazon beef jerky and this is definitely the saltiest by at least double. The first time I ate this, I could only handle 2 strips before I had to put it down again. My friend made a disgusted face and refused to have another bite. Luckily I am a salt lover so I can at least tolerate the extreme saltiness. But it's still too salty.<br /><br />Next up is the gristle. Sometimes amidst the generally tender bites there will be a mat of unchewable mass that I pretty much have to spit out or swallow whole. It happens more often than other brands and definitely more than I care for. Secondly, I don't know if it's the salt playing tricks on me, but the texture and taste is a bit worse than other brands, like they use lower quality jerky.<br /><br />Overall I believe that Wild Ride is less quality than most other brands, even when you factor in the low price. There are similarly priced brands that are of higher quality and lower sodium content. I don't know why they sell so well. Personally my next bulk order beef jerky will be with someone else.

review/summary: Tastes good but NOT all natural
review/text: I ordered this product because it was described as "all-natural with no chemical preservatives" and the gold box price price was good.  It arrived quickly, as usual for Amazon, and it tastes good.  But, it's not "all-natural with no chemical preservatives" unless you consider sodium nitrite and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil to fall under that description.  I would consider ordering it again if it weren't for the artificial ingredients.<br /><br />How do they get away with suggesting that there are no artificial preservatives (sodium nitrite) in this stuff?  Sodium nitrite has been linked to migraines and colon cancer and has been used as a poison in larger quantities.

review/summary: Gnaw yourself off a chunk
review/text: When I first encountered these Cowboy Strips I as a bit confused. Were they in fact made of beef or cowboy? Since cannibalism hasn't generally been in practice for quite some time (and even when it was, only by savages of the worst sort), I felt it was quite likely that the 'beef' mentioned in the title was the meat source, but it wasn't out of the realm of possibility to believe these to be beef flavored COWBOY strips made from real life cowboys. That thought caused my stomach to turn, and because I take great pride in leading a cannibalism free lifestyle, I decided it might be wise to contact the manufacturers of WILD RIDE just to double check--similarly I once contacted the makers of the very confusingly named 'chicken of the sea' brand tuna fish to see if it was chicken or fish; quite an important distinction! Better safe than sorry over having broken my nearly 30 year streak of cannibalism avoidance in one fell swoop, I gave WILD RIDE a call!<br /><br />Thankfully, WILD RIDE confirmed that this was in fact BEEF jerky, and that the Cowboy reference in the title was just an adjective explaining the sort of jerky it is: long, thin strips that are chewable, soft, and very, very tasty. I suggested that they rename it "Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips (NOT MADE FROM COWBOYS. NO COWBOYS INJURED IN THE MAKING OF THIS JERKY)" and they agreed such a change could potentially be useful. Much obliged for their assistance in understanding their product and their intentions (after all if they WERE selling COWBOY jerky, it might call into question what sort of operation they run, and if they are in-fact a Zombie enterprise!) I was able to enjoy all four bags of this jerky in about 30 minutes. Wishing I had more, I took a stroll to the outhouse because I suddenly wasn't feeling that well, and the next thirty minutes I spent thinking about what a great movie you could make about a Zombie owned corporation selling COWBOY JERKY to the unknowing public. I couldn't decide if I'd prefer to have Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal play the protagonist (or possibly pair them up!) or if the ending would involve a nuclear warhead wiping out the zombies or just let Chuck and Stev-o whack them apart with machetes, but at least these unanswered questions successfully distracted me from the 3.1 magnitude earthquake that was shaking the entire outhouse.<br /><br />So put your mind at ease: these are BEEF strips made in the cowboy fashion, and they're very, very tasty!

However,  I am trying to help the people not to waste their money on a product.  This peppered beef jerky, is without a shadow, the nastiest jerky<br />that I have ever tasted.  I know about jerky.  I make jerky myself sometimes.  This jerky is like chewing on a piece of "Fat Back", you have to wipe<br />the grease off your chin and hands after trying to eat it. I don't believe that is 97% fat free.  You can wring the grease out of it.  These comments<br />that I am making are concerning the package that I received.  Other people who commented highly on this product, must have received a much different<br />product than I received or has never eaten any real beef jerky.<br /><br />The package was made in the U.S is all the information that I can find concerning the product. Doesn't say where the beef is from or any info of this<br />nature.  I will not eat this beef jerky, it is sickening.  Take heed people, if you want and like jerky, DO NOT buy whatever this stuff is............

review/text: It's great-tasting jerky, but if you're trying to avoid sweets, you might want to steer clear of this.  A one-ounce serving has seven grams of sugar.  Seven grams is almost a quarter of an ounce.  So a quarter of this product's weight comes from sugar.  Not exactly what you'd expect from a dried beef snack, but not much different from several other brands.  In fact, most popular brands have 5 or more grams of sugar per ounce.  If you don't mind the sugar, go for it!

review/summary: probably not from the Texas Ranch ...
review/text: Jim Davis may have been a Texas Rancher but the beef is sourced from "USA or Uruguay or New Zealand or Australia and further processed in USA" the flavor is overpowering, which I guess I should have expected from "hickory" but it doesn't taste like hickory smoke to me, it tastes like corn syrup (or maybe that's the hydrolyzed soy protein?) it's got enough hydrogenated this-and-that to fuel the Hindenburg. It's also loaded with sodium, which most jerky is, but it really *tastes* salty too. The meat is tender because it was tenderized with papain which is an enzyme in papayas (thanks Wikipedia) there does seem to be a good amount of gristly threads running through it. That doesn't really bother me so much, but it's definitely not "naturally tender" meat. This stuff is marginally edible but I wouldn't buy it again. As noted the claims of "no nitrites" in the description are false: Beef, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein (Hydrolyzed Soy protein, Corn Syrup Solids, Partially Hydrogenated Cottonseed and Soy Oil, Caramel Color), Water, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein (Hydrolyzed Soy and Corn Protein, Salt with Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (Cottonseed, Soybean) added), Dehydrated Garlic, Black Pepper, Curing Salt (Salt, Sodium Nitrite).

Also, I might mention that after the blurb about the "Texas Rancher" looking for something better, I wasn't expecting the advisory on the bag that the Beef was not only sourced in the USA, but in Uruguay, New Zealand or Austrailia. Oh well, a guy can dream.<br /><br />Tastes pretty good if you close your eyes.

I order several packages to come monthly on a subscription basis as my kids and I love this healthy snack.  You know the stuff they sell at 7-11 they claim is beef jerky?  Well, this is how this one is different:<br /><br />1. The meat has great texture.  It is chewy, not brittle. You tear bites off with your teeth.<br />2. The quality of the meat itself is quite good. Not too many fatty pieces - it tastes like beef, not chemicals.<br />3. Unless you order teriyaki, the jerky is not sweet. Original flavor is just a tad spicy, but tolerable for kids. It's what we always get.<br />4. It does not have an infinite shelf life.  I found it go bad within a month or two. Bad for nuclear winter. Great for a healthy snack.  :-)<br /><br />I love the little packages inside the big one. The jerky stays fresh longer.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Pretty Good, but not Perfect
review/text: I bought this out of curiosity and out of the fact that I was just craving some jerky. The original flavor has a mild peppery taste to it and it's really tasty. It's mostly tender, but there are some strips of meat that have beef tendons, making the strips really hard to chew. Yes, there does seem to be some sort of "grit" in the beef jerky, but I'm not really too bothered by it. The other thing I don't like about this is that there are sometimes (just sometimes) strips of meat that have no flavor. But overall, I think this was a pretty good buy. I might buy it again, but only after I try some other brands.

review/summary: Fabulous Beef Jerky
review/text: Wild Ride Jerky is definitely my favorite jerky on the market right now. This jerky is great because it is not only a healthier alternative to many other beef jerkies on the market but the taste is far superior.  I'll never go back to the other brands!
