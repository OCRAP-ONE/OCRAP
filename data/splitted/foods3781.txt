review/summary: Easy & Very Tasty Gluten-Free Pancake Mix
review/text: As the mother of a child with celiac disease, I know how hard it can be to find tasty gluten free products. Pamela's Products always delivers! I have yet to be disappointed with any of the mixes. My husband who generally hates all of the GF (gluten-free) mixes really likes these pancakes, they are as close to the original as we have found. I can add chocolate chips or blueberries... I've even created awesome sweet potato pancakes :-) I just can not stress how easy this mix is... It's just as easy as making regular pancakes.<br /><br />Also, I have used the mix to make cookies and if you go to the website they have a yellow cake recipe. ANY PARENT that has to bake regularly for school parties etc, this mix is a life saver! I always send in GF cupcakes & cookies for the classroom parties and this mix makes it a snap!

review/summary: Excellent Gluten-Free Baking Mix!
review/text: I always try to have this product on hand.  This mix makes pancakes that taste the closest to "traditional" pancakes, at least that I have found.  It also makes great cookies, cobblers, etc. I highly recommend this product. (As do my 3 and 5 year old!)

review/summary: The Ultimate "Gluten Free" Pancake Mix
review/text: After being diagnosed with Celiac disease 2yrs ago I had great difficulty finding a good pancake mix.  Pamelas is by far the best I have tried.  In fact I consider it better than most mixes made from wheat.This mix also produces excellent waffles.  The mix is rather expensive in food stores but is affordable when purchased through Amazon.

review/text: This mix is a pantry staple. I use it for more than just pancakes. Last week I made delicious pumpkin-chocolate chip muffins with it, which are big sellers in my household. Today, I'm using the flour to make gluten-free lemon scones. Can you say yum? This is a must-have item for any gluten-free household. Enjoy!

review/text: I use at least one bag of this product a month and sometimes more.  I have made waffles, pancakes, muffins, and cookies.  My husband eats all this along with me and thinks they are great.  The Peanut Butter Cookies are awesome.  I have been using this product for a little over a year and have not had anything that was bad tasting.  The texture of everything is absolutely great also.  I have just recently gotten the new brochure with all the newest recipes and have not had a chance to try all of them yet.  I brag about this product to everyone that has celiac and tell what wonderful things you can make with just one product.

review/text: I am not one to review a product, but I really feel so strongly about Pamela's.  IN September '06, I found out I was celiac and that led to a lot of confusion!  I tried a lot of different products out there and lucked out when I found Pamela's Baking Mix at a local health food store and then my luck improved when I found it here on Amazon at such a great savings and FREE shipping!  It makes great pancakes and biscuits and I have been experimenting and substituting it in some of my favorite recipes.  IN fact, I just finished a piece of pumpkin spice cake(Made with Pamela's) that everyone in my family loves!  If you have any kind of wheat intolerance of allergy I highly recommend Pamela's!

review/summary: Good, but...
review/text: This mix is easy to prepare and makes nice, light pancakes, but I find I have to add 2 to 3 teaspoons of vanilla for flavor or else they don't taste like much. I tried using the recipe on the side of the package for chocolate chip cookies, and they were terrible - the taste and texture weren't good at all. Then I tried the waffle recipe. They were ok, but again, they didn't taste like much. And if you don't eat them all right away, they get soggy; freezing and toasting didn't help much, they just burned in the toaster. So far, the best recipe I have found for waffles/pancakes comes from the book The Best Gluten Free Family Cookbook by Donna Washburn and Heather Butt. You have to buy several flours (sorghum, almond, brown rice, and soy) and two starches to make the mix, but it's totally worth it. As for Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix, I know everyone else raves about it, and for pancakes the texture is surprisingly like regular wheat pancakes, but taste is blah and the other recipes aren't very good. I used up my case of 6, but won't be repurchasing.<br />UPDATE**I had been unhappy with using this as a baking mix until I tried the recipe for muffins on the side of the bag. I made them exactly as directed, using honey and frozen blueberries as the fruit. They are delicious. Tip: if you can't eat them fast enough, they get crumbly (overnight!) so freeze them as soon as they've cooled or store them in food saver containers.

review/summary: FANTASTIC!!!!
review/text: Greetings,<br /><br />As I get older, I'm finding that certain types of foods no longer work well for me.  So far, I can't eat chocolate that's less than about 60% cocoa.  Milk chocolate is out, completely.  Same for peanuts.  Lately, I've been trying to cut way back on wheat gluten, as that is causing problems, too.  If I eat too many products that contain wheat gluten, I get a stuffy nose, and also can develop some skin eczema.  After trying quite a few gluten-free products, we were very happy to find Pamela's Products Ultimate Baking & Pancake Mix!!  This stuff is simply fantastic!  I have been making waffles with it, often, and they turn out fluffy, tasty, and very enjoyable!  The great part is I can now eat four waffles, and do NOT get a stuffy nose at all!!  YIPPEE!!!  They taste wonderfully delicious, too, and if I want to make several batches, they also freeze well.  I would recommend reheating them in the oven, rather than the microwave, however, as they have a better consistency that way.  I cannot recommend Pamela's mix more strongly, and am very happy to have found this outstanding company!  Now, we're trying other products from Pamela's, and hope they will turn out to be just as great as this wonderful mix we now use.  Pamela's has made two more life-long customers out of my wife and I, and we wish them a very long and successful business, so we can keep buying this great mix from them!  If you are having gluten problems, I whole-heartedly recommend that you give this sumptuous mix a try.  I'm sure you will not be disappointed!  Take care, and God Bless!

review/text: A friend who recently went gluten free introduced me to this product. I have celiac disease. She told me where to buy it and gave me recipe..I baked the coffee cake last weekend and it was really good. This weekend I just played with it trying my own ideas and it turned out so good!<br />I quit baking years ago when I found that trying to bake gluten free required so much work and was very expensive buying all the different flours...now it is fun to bake again!<br />Recipe:<br />1C suger, 2/3 C butter, (cream together) add 2 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, (blend) gradualy add 2C Pamela's Baking & Pancake mix.<br /><br />Whip 2 egg whites until stiff peaks form and fold into cake mix..pour in 9X11 baking pan.<br /><br />I also blended 1/2 C applesauce, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp of sugar and 2 tbs light brown sugar. I spooned this on top of the cake mix after spreading gently in pan and bake at 350 for 28 minutes...or until golden brown and the toothpick test comes out clean.

review/text: This mix can do SO much more than pancakes and waffles! It is by far the most versatile GF mix I have ever found.  I use it to coat chicken & fish (it gives them a slight nutty flavor), thicken soups, make cakes, bar cookies, cobblers, and any other dessert you can think of.  If you use it to make sugar cookies, they will have a slight nutty consistency.  Ive been cooking GVF for 18 years & this mix is a Godsend!!

review/text: I've just gotten my 3rd shipment on the subscribe-and-save plan and have to say it is one of my very favorite gluten-free products.  I like the pancakes, waffles and muffins using the recipe on the package.  I've also made the zucchini and pumpkin breads but my favorite is Pamela's Banana Bread that I've made many times.  [...] Lately instead of making it as a loaf of bread, I've been baking it as muffins, which cuts the baking time to about 20 min. They also freeze well.  I'd buy this product even if I didn't have celiac...it is that good!!!

It makes gluten-free baking easy and delicious and our wheat loving family and friends don't know/care that they're eating G-F.  This works just fine when substituted in our old favorite "wheat flour" recipes.  It's a little pricey but has become our favorite brand, worth the cost because it doesn't disappoint.  Buying by Amazon subscription is a bargain.

review/summary: Yummy Pancakes and Muffins!
review/text: I purchased the Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix primarily for pancakes. I am not allergic to wheat (someone I know is) nor am I on a gluten free diet, but I wanted to try this baking mix out and give some to my friend. The box of six packages was a good deal because of the bulk discount and it allowed for me to give some away as gifts, as well do some of my own baking.<br /><br />I'd definitely buy this product again and I would try other Pamela's Products. I also recommend it to anyone with wheat/gluten free diet needs who is looking for something that tastes good with a pleasant texture as well.<br /><br />The pancakes were amazing! The resulting texture and flavor is by far better than most other pancake mixes I have tried...in fact, I think this may be my all-time favorite pancake mix and I usually eat pancakes with wheat flour in them.<br /><br />Aside from pancakes, I baked blueberry muffins with this mix. They turned out fantastic! If I remember right, I used real butter and whole milk when baking with this mix though Pamela offers low-fat variations on the package. The directions and recipe variations on the packaging are very helpful.<br /><br />I really enjoy the texture with the almond meal and blend of different flours. The pancakes are not too heavy or grainy--which you might expect from a wheat free baking product containing something like almond meal--but they do have a texture that differs from a pure wheat flour pancake. The texture was perhaps even more ideal for muffins. Yummy!

review/text: I was skeptical at first. I'm not a health nut. I don't try to eat gluten-free, vegetarian, kosher, etc. I usually end up eating the food that tastes the best. And this is the BEST. I'm amazed that anything can so easily top a staple like flour, but this product wins hands down. I have been using this baking mix regularly for everything I can find an excuse to use it with. Pancakes? Best pancakes I've ever made--they were mouth watering. Muffins? Best muffins I've ever made--can't get enough. In fact, I tried making the exact same muffin recipe with normal flour after relying on Pamela's mix and it only confirmed what I already knew. No comparison. Buy this if you enjoy food.

review/text: Yum. Cooks up like a thin French pancake (but a bit thicker than a crepe). If you want fat and fluffy then you want the gluten free Bisquick Mix which lacks seasoning and costs alot more. If you are cooking Pamela's just for yourself, you can save half of the mixed batch and refrigerate for a day or two...they cook up exactly the same. Or you can go ahead and cook them all at once, refrigerate the unused, and reheat.I find all of Pamela's products to be excellent substitutes for what I used to be able to eat!

review/text: well, reasonably priced for gluten free.  We have a new caregiver who needs gluten free.<br /><br />I often buy gluten free where available for the same price (read some stuff about gluten free diets for kids with autism - figured it couldn't hurt to cut some out of our diets).  However, I never would have considered substituting anything for my Bisquick pancakes.  But I figured when the new nanny brought over a tiny box of gluten free Bisquick that she paid $4.59 for, there had to be something better.  So far so good - we had pancakes and banana muffins and both were great.  I still prefer the gluten-filled stuff, but the difference in taste is barely perceptible.

review/text: This mix makes great pancakes and waffles.  I have everyone in the house eating gluten free, so far no complaints, anyway I got rid of all the wheat stuff in the house.  With this mix you can't tell the difference between gluten free and the nasty wheat ones.

review/summary: Great flour
review/text: This is my daughter's favorite brand.  Beside making the pancakes & the cookies, she adds this flour to some other gf mixes to give the cookies or cakes more rise or fluff.  She has used it more than I and has convinced me to do as she does.  All Pamela products that she has used she loves.

review/text: My family has been gluten free for 8 years.  We've been through may GF baking products and have tried making my own GF mixes from scratch. Pamela's Baking Mix has by far given me the best results and is versitile. I always keep it in stock. Save yourself the time and money, and just get Pamela's.

review/summary: Best GF Waffles Ever!
review/text: I just ordered this and made my kids (and waffle lovers) the most delicious GF waffles.  We've tried so many mixes and most of them are good albeit a little grainy.  Not Pamela's!  There is no graininess at all, just a delicious texture that no one would recognize as gluten free.  Can't wait to try this mix to make scones for my hubs this weekend.  The Pamela's website has TONS of recipes that use this mix as a base.

review/summary: yeah, pancakes again and its more delicious than plain flour!
review/text: Dont we just love this gluten free pancake mix; we tired it first by buying a single packet from the store and tried this with a couple of other brands found in WHoleFoods.  Hands down this flour mix was by far the best and why we loved it:<br />- the mixture forms beautifully on the griddle [good circular shape]<br />- not runny consistency even when you follow the instructions<br />- had a nice buttery  taste (no butter added)<br />- we added a 1.5 tablespoon of flax mix with the 1 cup of flour and that only further enhanced the flavor and goodness<br />- cooked evenly and was easy to flip to cook other side<br /><br />these may seems like obvious points, but some other larger GF brand really didnt meet the standard.  Actually this tsate a whole heap better than using either plain white or whole wheat flour.  I would recommend this brand for GF or non-GF. We will be recommending this to family and friends, GF or no GF!

review/text: This baking mix is amazing.  Great flavor and many recipes to choose from - both on the package and the website.  My husband and I agree that these pancakes are better than leading brands that contain gluten.  We used this mix to make pizza dough last night, and it was incredibly tasty.  It was much easier to use this mix than another pizza crust mix we've tried.  The freshness and quality are excellent.  This product has quickly become a staple in my gluten-free diet.

review/text: We have been gluten free for 3 months now since our diagnosis and I have tried to make pancakes that tasted like what we ate before with no success. All others we tried had a horrible aftertaste. Once we tried Pamela's that was not the case! We will only buy Pamela's mixes now-they are like regular gluten filled mixes but probably better. If you are on the fence about getting this-just hit buy. You will not be disappointed!

The sweetness of the lemongrass is enough that I have no desire to add any type of sweetener to the tea at all...no matter if I'm drinking it hot or cold. Which is another wonderful facet to this tea...hot or cold, it is refreshing, satisfying, and very tasty. Rishi Tea is a bit pricy but it is quality stuff nicely packaged and, by availing of Amazon's subscribe and save feature, I'm paying less than the prices at the grocery stores I frequent. I love this tea!

I recommend this if you want to give that extra punch to a dish, but don't want to shell out the 100-200 for a whole truffle. Package was not damaged at all, shipped just fine. And, these are not Chinese truffles. Whomever mentioned that in a prior review was mistaken. I know true truffles when I taste them, and this is the real deal.

The excitement of receiving and opening the product quickly vanishes as the contents bluntly present themselves as mushrooms in a jar. Presence of any truffles or truffle flavoring is questionable at best. Treat yourself and spend a little more if you want a decent truffle flavor. This is a definite never again.

review/summary: Fantastic for our picky dog
review/text: Our dog, as much as we love him, is definitely picky.  For the longest time, we could only get through *most* of one bag of a particular dog food before he got sick of it and wouldn't finish his daily portions.  While going through different brands and flavors of dog food, this pattern kept repeating.<br /><br />Until we tried Go! duck formula, that is.<br /><br />For the past year, this has been his primary food.<br /><br />But my own dog's pickiness probably isn't a good enough reason for you to buy this.  I can't blame you.  What this food does offer, though, is this:<br />a) Duck is a very hypoallergenic food, so it's great for dogs with limited diets.<br />b) This has high-quality ingredients, so you don't need to feed your dog as large of portions as you do with value brands.  This means that you get more for your buck.<br />c) Every list needs three items, but a) and b) pretty well cover it.  Also, our dog finds this food delicious.

review/summary: He likes it.  He really likes it.
review/text: We have a picky eater.  Initially we tried the cheapy route with a few off the shelf grocery store dog foods; with those he wouldn't eat for a day or two before getting too hungry to avoid it.  Then we went with Blue Buffalo Wliderness, because of positive reviews and a recommendation from a dog trainer.  He mostly liked it, except for the dark black bits (I think the antioxidants in the food.  They kind of looked like dried blueberries.  So he would pick through his food, spitting those out on the floor and making a mess.<br /><br />This dog food he really likes.  So much so that we actually have to pay attention to how much he eats; the other foods he has tried we could just fill up the bowl every so often and he ate whenever.<br /><br />We are on our second bag of food (8 weeks into feeding Go!) And have no complaints.

review/summary: Excellent with my dog
review/text: For my dog, this natural dog food was a good choice to gradually move off his usual food to see how he would react to it. He has some food allergies that I wanted to see if changing his diet might clear it up. This Duck formula worked for him. He loves it and has had no problems with elimination or lack of appetite. He is a 2+ year old rescued Border Collie with a little bit of food allergies and a weight problem. Happy to say he is now gaining some weight, enjoying this dog food, and getting some much needed love and exercise while showing improvement with the food allergies. I would recommend this for almost any dog as a safe change of diet if you do it a little at a time. I started with the 6 pound bag mixing it with his old food and then when everything looked good, ordered the 25 pound bag. It is expensive but I believe my dog is worth it.

review/text: This soup is great when it's late and you haven't had dinner, but don't want to eat something huge before bed.  The noodles are fresh and all the little bags and bowl make it fun.  Plus it tastes pretty good too.<br />Of course, the key here is that this is fast and convenient.  If you are looking for hearty then pull out your crock pot.

review/summary: Annie Chun's Noodle Bowls
review/text: I have been buying Annie Chun's soups for a few years and just found them on Amazon.  I enjoy them very much and now that I can save a few dollars by ordering them from Amazon, I am very happy.  The soups are very tasty and some of them are lower in sodium than many of the other brands.  So, I'm eating something healthy and saving some money.  Great!!

review/summary: Hot and Sour Noodle Bowl is Awesome if. . .
review/text: I discovered this soup a couple of months ago at Giant Eagle, but thought it was too expensive ($4.29).  After searching other grocery stores to no avail, I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon. . .  I LOVE this soup--but do not like it without adding soy sauce.  After it's cooked, stir in soy sauce to taste and you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: Compared to other brands of instant soup cups, Annie Chun's Hot and Sour Soup Bowl is pretty darn good.  Compared to the other flavors of Annie Chun's Soup Bowls, this one is a major disappointment.<br /><br />The noodles are fabulous, and the veggies reconstitute very well, as with all Annie Chun's Soup Bowls, but unfortunately the flavor is really lacking.  I can't quite put my finger on what exactly is missing, but it basically tastes like extremely watered-down hot and sour soup.  I'm Annie Chun's biggest fan, so it pains me to leave a negative review, but the Hot and Sour is definitely out of my order rotation.

review/text: Tried the Hot and Sour soup bowl and the Ppad thai. Putting 970 and 1000 units of salt in those products turns them into an abomination. My wife and I took one spoonful of each, then prompty put the remainder down the disposal and went out to eat. What you do to those dishes at least is a terrible waste of food, in a time and in a nation when decent food is at a premius. For your sake, hope you have a good customer base because we won't be back, nor will any friends who share food reviews with us.

review/summary: Easy and tasty
review/text: I've been using Annie Chun's for years now.  I like to add a bit of fresh vegtables or sometimes meat to them but they are good plain if you're in a hurry.  This is very hot.  Like I do with their other dishes I just dumped in the entire flavor pack...oops it was so hot I couldnt taste anything but the hot.  After a bit of experimentation I found for me that about 1/2 the flavor packet and a heaping tablespoon of yogurt made this a really flavorful hot and sour dish.  Add some shrimp if you can find good wild shrimp and you'll think you're in a high quality restaurant.  Considering it comes to my remote door the price here isn't too bad compared to the box stores which often don't have all the flavors to choose from.

review/summary: The Best Instant Noodle Meals You Can Buy!
review/text: Why?  Because the noodles come SOFT, sealed in plastic!  If you are tired of noodles that "crunch" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.<br /><br />Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start.  You can always add more in later.<br /><br />Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.  (For this reason you should NOT attempt to reuse this bowl like you may have done with other brand instant noodle meals that came in plastic bowls.)<br /><br />Note: Of them all this is my favorite flavor, great tasting, medium hot, best hot and sour soup I've ever had from instant!

review/text: I purchased these on Amazon based on the nutrition information provided. It is a LIE. The packaging states 1 serving per package, 290 calories, 970 mg sodium. Thats a lot of sodium!!! The nutrition information on this website states 140 calories and 470 mg sodium for one serving. If that were the actual case, I might actually try the soup. Now I will never know if the soup actally TASTES good or not since it has proved to be A VERY UNHEALTHY CHOICE. Please provide ACCURATE AND ACTUAL information so your customers can make INFORMED decisions. Waste of my time and money. The ACTUAL NUTRITION FACTS from the side of the carton are: Calories 210, total fat 1.5g, Sodium 970mg, Total carbs 59g, dietary fiber 2g, sugars 4g, protien 11g. As you can see you are consuming about half a days sodium and depending on your diet, a lot of carbs with very little nutritional value. Had this information been available on Amazon, I would have purchased something else for my workday lunches.

review/text: I thought this would be the best for our mocha beverages.  So, foolishly I purchased 3 bottles.  It does not taste at all like white chocolate.  It is very sugary and also seems to be more a peppermint flavor.  So bad we tossed 2-1/2 bottles and are now using only Fontana which will taste identical to Starbucks beverages.  The vendor I purchased the Ghirardelli from was aware of the taste issue.  Years ago when I bought this the taste was awesome.  Must be they changed a great recipe to now something so off I don't know how they can call it white chocolate sauce and put their label on it.  Cheaper than Fontana yes .... but you will get cheap quality too.

They are also my go-to early-morning-flight breakfast - always throw one in my purse before I head out to the airport at dawn.  I love the sesame-seedy texture - makes me more inclined to nibble, which makes them last longer.  So yummy!

I like that my younger tot can bite off piece without chipping a tooth, as with some crunchy granola bars, but yet it does not become a pile of mush in her car seat.  Its great that the whole family loves these bars, so we don't have to stock our pantry with multiple cases of different brands.  It also feels good to vote with my dollars and support a company that has ethical business practices and supports their local and global communities.  Try all of the Bumblebar varieties.

I love sesame seeds and flax seeds but this was too intense. I tried the lemon and chocolate flavors and did not enjoy the lemon flavor at all. It smells delicious, almost like lemon meringue pie but tasted too artificial to me. The chocolate didn't taste bad bu I could not handle more than two bites because of the texture. I chewed each bite for like 5 minutes because of all the flax seeds. I'm taking these to the office and sticking to my yummy KIND bars.
