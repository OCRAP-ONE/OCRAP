review/summary: Don't pay attention to the other reviewer
review/text: This kit appears to be made by the same folks who make the Vino Italiano kits.  The paperwork and ingredient packaging were identical.  I made it into a 6.5 gallon batch (my fermenter is 7 gallons and I didn't want air space) and my IG was 1.085, very good.  Fermentation lasted 24 days and FG was .985.  I added some toasted oak chips to my primary fermenter as well.  Wine was dry, crisp and quite easy to clear.  It even impressed some wannabe wine snobs.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended.  These kits are no brainers, and with the price and free shipping the wine is about $1.75 per bottle and is comparable to an $8-$12 wine, IMO.  This is my second kit from this supplier and I am nothing but happy.  Nice to have a good bottle of wine with dinner and not have to cringe at spending $10 each night.  Besides, it's easy and fun. Heck, they even throw in free corks. I was already homebrewing for 15 years and decided to try my hand at wine.  I had built my own "kit" by buying concentrated juice, acid, yeast, clarifiers, etc.  I ended up spending about 25% more than this kit without a noticeable difference in quality. Go for it, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Great White Wine
review/text: This wine turned out great. Nice color and clean finish. It makes a great utility white table wine that is semi-dry that goes well with lighter meats. I will buy more, however, as many reviewers have stated, only make these and Vino Italiano kits to 5 gallons and NOT 6. Making it to 6 gallons or 23 litres will yield a weak and thin wine. The price per bottle is still a very good deal.

Since I'm of Hungarian descent, finding a good Hungarian paprika is important to me for making some of my family recipes.

review/text: Yes, my pups love these chewy treats and I love the fact that they are made in the USA.  I'm currently using them for training treats since they are so popular, and since my pups are still small (13 pounds and 7 pounds) I break them into three pieces.  Now this would be a ridiculous thing to do with a big dog, but with the pups it takes them some time to eat even a third (about the size of a Chiclet) because they are chewy.<br /><br />Made from Chicken, Brown rice, barley flour, cane molasses, vegetable glycerin, chicken liver, gelatin, apples, carrots, salt, phosphoric acid, sorbic acid (as a preservative) mixed tocopherols (also a perservative) glucosamine hydrocholoride, and chondroitin sulfate.<br /><br />A 10-30 pound dog should get 2 treats/day.

review/summary: Flavorful, Light Sweetener
review/text: A few years ago I started using Agave nectar as a sweetener in my tea, and I have never looked back. Its mild, light flavor is an ideal additional to various teas as it doesn't detract from their flavor. I've tried several different Agave nectar flavors, and of all of them I liked the Madhava brand the best. This particular size works the best for me, as it usually lasts me several weeks. Highly recommended.

Couldn't stop eating! This one had a bitter/funny after taste, some figs even had a slight grayish look, was too dry and hard (was it due to too much preservative Potassium Bromate or sitting in storage for too long or what?), and wasn't that sweet either!  Disappointed to say the least..  I truly hope the rest (5 more 12oz cups to go) of the batch taste better than this first cup I opened, although I doubt that very much..  The price was decent with free shipping.  But then again price isn't everything!  Ahh..Live and learn..

review/summary: Sweeter and a bit dry in places but good
review/text: I have had Blue Ribbon figs for years in the store.  They were usually a bit more moist than these, perhaps because of packaging (they were in plastic bags like the ones prunes and other dried fruit come in while these are in tubs).  The figs are sweeter and more consistent than the other local source i have for figs here in Utah, and that I like.  These are not as moist as they were long ago, but similar to those days, you will have the occasional fig that's got sort of a dried, tough, perhaps sunburnt edge.  That just comes with the fig territory if you like to eat them out of hand as I do.  Overall - this is a great item to have on hand, a nice change from raisins or craisins, and very yummy.

review/summary: best organic espresso yet...
review/text: Coffee beans are one of those food items that can be very high in pesticide residues, so along with bananas, milk, lettuce and a few other things, we added coffee to our 'must buy organic' list. After being thoroughly spoiled by Lavazza super crema, Lavazza gran riserva, and Filicori Zecchini gran crema forte, we had a hard time finding an organic espresso that wouldn't disappoint. We've been using BackCountry organic basecamp espresso for three weeks now, and are thoroughly delighted. Although the crema (foam) isn't quite as pronounced as you get with the italian espressos I mentioned, the taste is excellent! It's creamier and less bitter than other organic espressos i've tried, and is a solid replacement for the Lavazza super crema (in taste, not crema). If the price stays comparable to Lavazza, we'll stick with BackCountry for our morning routine.

review/summary: Good beans!
review/text: Very satisfied with this city roast (espresso roast)! The beans make a great cup of latte and americano, not sure how it taste as a shot as I don't drink straight espresso. The one thing that stands out with these beans to me is the fact that the coffee doesn't go sour after it's been in your cup for awhile. Yes...you're suppose to drink your coffee within 15 minutes of when it's made, but I like to drink some now and save a little later to see if I need more kick when the caffeine has activated in your system.<br /><br />The beans also smell great and I keep them in my bean-vac to ensure freshness and grind only what I need each time. The grinds seem more dense than most of what I've tried before. After putting it in the perc, it doesn't pack down as much as most other beans.

But Annie's Cheddar Bunnies are a sure thing. He'll eat them for breakfast, lunch or dinner and bounces up and down happily when he sees the purple box. Though I'd prefer he ate something more substantial, at least I know they're made from real ingredients including organic flour and real cheese. They're also lower in sodium than many comparable cheese crackers including the Earth's Best Organics brand which I appreciate. Most importantly, since many of my meals these days consist of his leftovers, they're delicious.

I try to be careful, but sometimes it is invevitable.<br /><br />The price here is the best I have seen (better than Annie's own website) and this larger size is not available many places.

review/summary: Natural and Super Tasty!
review/text: I only recently discovered these crackers and think they're a great product. They are very light and crispy, yet flavorful and not too salty. The ingredient list is reassuring as so many snack products are loaded with junk. Also, so many natural brands make snacks that can taste pretty bland.<br />These are a win win. I higly recommend these scrumptious Bunnies!

review/text: I enjoy other Annie's products and figured I'd give these a try. Similar to Goldfish, but better. A more authentic flavor and certainly better for you. My husband, who doesn't like Goldfish, loves these. Perfect for a little "something" if you can't wait for lunch or dinner.

That must be because they don't have all the artificial stuff.  Good for picky eaters like my daughter!

It took about a month for our little girl to stop calling them "sishy crackers."  She couldnt tell a difference.  In my opinion they tast better than goldfish crackers.  They're not as salty tasting.  I think we have these with at least 2 meals a day, not to mention snacks.  I love snacking on them too!!  A great snack for the whole family!!!

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: I bought this product from a local outlet several times and have always enjoyed it quite a bit. I usually brew 4-6 times in a row using my 16 ounce infuser and the same 2-4 teaspoons of tea. The price seems a little more worthwhile when considering this. The tea itself has a flavor that I would call smooth and green, a little strong but not bitter at all. I can only compare this to other Teavana loose leaf teas and various brands of bagged teas (Stash, Yogi, Lipton, and others), but gyokuru imperial is an all time favorite. I also like that despite giving a strong caffiene boost to my day it never has given me the jagged feeling or lift and drop that I have come to expect from coffie and strong black teas. It is a short steep tea made for 40 seconds to 1 minute per serving which I like as I am a little impatient with preparing tea. If you have a tea store nearby, do yourself a favor<br /> and ask to smell this, it will taste much the same when finished.

review/summary: A very nice mild green tea
review/text: I love Japanese green tea and had read that gyokuro is the finest variety, so I decided to splurge on this tea. The tea is very nice, but not worth the price (in my opinion) compared to other sencha teas at a quarter of the price. I prefer a tea that brews bright green with a distinct grassy taste. This tea (using 1.5 teaspoons with 8 oz. of 175�F water and brewing for for 3 minutes) brewed tea with a faint green hue and a delicate, mild flavor. The flavor was fresh and sweet but not as bold as I had hoped. As one would expect, a second infusion (brewed for 4 minutes) was even weaker and only beneficial if one is being frugal (or wants to avoid the caffeine that is mostly extracted in the first infusion).

They don't respond to emails,etc. You have to wait on the phone for hours. Simply unacceptable. Feel free to check their facebook wall to see customers voicing the same concern. The company simply does not seem to appreciate its customers and apparently many people feel the same way. I will no longer buy from them due to their poor service and overpriced products.

review/summary: No Way!
review/text: This is the worst thing to eat for breakfast! I was running late for work one morning and it was down between grabbing a sandwich from Hardees or throwing two of these in the microwave for 10 seconds because that's all the time I had. So anyhow, I opted for the latter. By the time I got to work and got halfway to my first break I had the worst stomach ache. Now, thinking maybe it was something else I didn't attribute that to these poptarts. On a Saturday morning I put two in the toaster and scrambled some egg beaters southwestern eggs with cheese and my stomach did the same thing. These would be nice advertised as dessert primarily but unfortunately these were too sugary for my taste. And on average I like to eat three very thick buttermilk pancakes and drown them in about 1/2 cup syrup and even for me it was too sweet. The flavor is great, however, which is why I kept eating them. If you are buying this for kids they may like it with no side effects but grownups, your stomachs are not iron made like it used to be; maybe the normal pop-tarts will suit your stomach better in the morning. For this reason I gave it a 3.5.

Retail stores in this area do not match that price, assuming you can find it.  It's a good mix of the original flavors - watermellon, apple, cherry, grape, and blue raspberry.  If you are buying candy in bulk for events like Halloween, it's a good choice.  I would note that I paid a higher price at a different source before finding the listing at Amazon.

review/summary: Great so far!
review/text: We've used these with two dogs (an 11 year old and a 9 week old) and have had absolutely no issues so far. In fact, these are the first dental chews that our 11 year old has ever been able to handle without issue. No digestive issues and no ill health effect; only happy pups whose eyes light up when we open the package.  They are also the perfect size for our pups to finish in one sitting; a little tasty distraction without having an all day chewing event.<br /><br />Now, I had no intention on posting a review for this product. However, after I saw such a poor rating on these chews that we had been using for our pups, I was quite concerned.  When I saw that the poor rating came from someone who had used the product only once (that I can tell) and negated it based not on fact or ill effects to their animals but solely on where the product was manufactured, I decided to post a counter review from someone who had actually used - and is still currently using - the product. Rest assured that if these PROVE to be a detriment to our pups (based on either factual evidence or research that I find), I will post an update.  If you don't see any updates, then all is still going great on this end, and I am a very satisfied customer.

After I gave them dreambones they ate these completely without leaving a trace behind. They never finished the other kind (Dingo)and we would either have to toss them or wait for the neighbors dog to come in to pick up the leftovers. They now beg for dreambones, snub any other kind and will not share the dreambones with each other like they would with the other kind. I found these locally only once and can not find them anywhere now. I just wish a local outlet store would carry these on a regualar basis. Ordering on line is OK, but picking them up while shopping would be helpful. Our dogs love their Dreambones!<br />Cindy Cole<br />Winfield IL

review/summary: Pretty good product
review/text: Both of my dogs really enjoyed this rawhide alternative bone. My dogs have been eating real rawhide for several years, with seemingly no issues. Recently, one of my dogs had a terrifying near-death experience; choking on a rawhide. After doing some research, I learned that this isn't an uncommon situation, and that rawhides are a known choking hazard. After the incident, I quickly researched different rawhide alternative bones, and theses ones were one of the first we have tried. They have more of a leathery texture, softer and more flexible than a rawhide. However, they are not soft treats that can be chewed up quickly, it still took my dogs some time to eat them, and enjoying them for about 10 minutes. One thing that I really liked about these bones is that they don't get stringy, slimy, and sticky like rawhides do. They get softer with chewing, and then brake off into smaller pieces, unlike rawhides that won't brake off, making the dream bones less of a choking hazard. They only reason I gave them a 4 star rating and not a 5 star rating is because the first ingredient (the most prevalent) is corn. Corn isn't the greatest thing for pets to consume because its not easy to digest. I avoid corn in pet food at all costs, but because this is a treat- and not a main food staple, I think it is okay. I do recommend these- especially over regular rawhides. I would recommend the dental version more as those ones smell really good and contain parsley and chlorophyl and other good smelling ingredients that aren't present in the chicken flavor.

review/summary: The ideal tuna for Tuna Helper
review/text: This is not my preferred tuna for fine dining; it's not my choice for tuna salad.  But it is the best to transform Tuna Helper into an ambrosial delight.  No other tuna works as well.<br /><br />Over the years I've developed my recipe for Tuna Helper Fettucine Alfredo.  Here are the changes and additions in a nutshell.<br /><br />1)  Use butter.<br /><br />2)  Substitute Half and Half for milk to impart a far richer flavor.<br /><br />3)  Add a dash of Tabasco when adding ingredients.<br /><br />4)  Add 1/2 cup dry vermouth (I prefer Martini & Rossi) just before covering the pan.  People living below 5000' elevation should cut the water by 1/2 cup.<br /><br />5)  Simmer; don't boil.  As the mixture cooks down, keep lowering the heat.  The noodles should become very soft and resemble a casserole.  If there's too much liquid remove the cover and increase the heat slighty.  But be careful.  A mild brown crustiness is excellent, but do be careful not to burn the noodles.<br /><br />Don't skimp on the tuna; use two cans.  I've tried three but that's too much.<br /><br />The emendations I've described work for other flavors of Tuna Helper as well but are most suited for the Fettucini Alfredo.<br /><br />Never use lumpy tuna for this.

He "used" to use the pink packets. Hmm. No problem, I'll just purchase an extra box for him. Even when "SugarTwin" became unavailable in my area stores, I searched the Internet and was pleasantly,pleased to find "SugarTwin" available for sale this way. AMEN! Their formulation is slightly different from other artificial sweetners and I believe this is why it tastes so good. Give it a try for yourself.

review/summary: Best-tasting low-calorie sweetener
review/text: I used SugarTwin for years prior to the introduction of Aspartame, and had been quite happy with it.  When the almost constant headaches I experienced were traced to Aspartame, I returned to SugarTwin and have used it ever since without headaches.  SugarTwin has a pleasant sweet taste and no artificial aftertaste unlike some other products.  For me, it is much better than anything else.

review/summary: Can't live without it!
review/text: I grew up in Canada and am a big tea drinker.  I drink 4-6 cups a day.  I've always used Sugar Twin (so much better than the pink or the blue or even the "other yellow" ones), since I was old enough to know how many calories I would be consuming by using sugar in that many cups of tea.  I am addicted to my tea like most are to coffee, (and that makes me wonder if Sugar Twin is some sort of drug?!?!!) and so when I moved to the States 11 years ago and found the ST in bulk form to be different (like Kit Kat.  Bet you didn't know they are better up in Canada?  Made by different companies) I started buying large quantities when I went home and being my own importer (the border crossings haven't always been easy!  Tons of white powder...).  I went online today to figure out if ST is aspertame or saccharine and found that I can buy the individual packets at Amazon?!?!?!?!?!  I think I'm in love.

review/summary: Fantastic product
review/text: I have been buying and using both the Comstock "no sugar added" cherry and apple pie filling for years and we all love it. My whole family is eating healthier nowadays and it makes a perfect "light" dessert. It has just the right amount of sweetness and just 30 or 35 calories for a decent size serving. I use it in my home-made pies because I can't make the pie filling from scratch any lower calorie than Comstock does! And I love the consistency of the product. I also use it alone, warmed up in the microwave with warm vanilla sauce that I make. A great quick dessert. Unfortunately, both supermarkets in my area have stopped carrying it!!! I was so pleased to find that Amazon did have it! It's a little more expensive than it was in the stores, but I can deal with that as long as I won't disappoint my family by not making pies anymore. :)

They are a little messy, since they are basically compressed balls of flaky freeze dried meat, so the bottom of the treat bag is just full of meat dust, essentially-not so easy to use for training. However, Murphy loves them, so I will keep buying them. Also, we got a bag that smelled a little wierd, I called the company directly, and they said that the treats were most likely fine, but were just oxidized, however, still told me to take them to ANY store that carries their brand and that store would exchange them for me.  And so I did. And they did!  They were extremely nice, and as I said before, I'll keep buying from them!

They both love it and sit at attention whenever they see me reach for that package.<br />It's natural, no preservatives, and the absolute best thing for holding their attention in training exercises. A little spendy, but a package goes a long way.<br />Can't recommend it enough!

review/summary: Product Came Smashed With Other Amazon Items
review/text: I've purchased these from Amazon vendors before with no issue.  This time, the three packs that I purchased came smashed so that the small nugget treats were mostly crumbs.  I didn't throw them away; I sprinkle them on my dog's food.  But, I still am without "treats" to give my dog at those times each day when he gets treats.  I had other items included in the package that were purchased directly from Amazon but I doubt that they should have caused so much damage to the treats.  I did not call to complain because I had visions of finger pointing between the vendor and Amazon.  But, the bags of treats were all pretty flattened prior to my opening them.  If this was a vendor problem, shouldn't Amazon have notice this prior to shipping?  My guess is that this happened in one of their distribution processes but who'll take the blame and who caused the damage?  In any case, I have to find a new means of purchasing these treats as I won't throw money to the wind again.  This is a first for me but I am thoroughly disgusted with this product at this time because of the damaged delivery.

review/summary: An Apple A Day...
review/text: Now, I'm already a big fan of Red Leaf Tea's green apple matcha, but that one really does taste like a green apple, tart and sweet all at the same time. Which is great, but every once in a while a girl needs a smoother apple, a juicer, sweeter apple, which is what I hope to gain from this matcha. I'm eager to try it as a latte with vanilla soy milk and some of their Cinnamon Matcha...I'm hoping for a apple pie with ice cream kind of drink. I love apples and apple juice, so whenever I spot an apple blend, I have to try it. And there are so many things you can do with apple that I'm hoping to be able to do with this apple matcha. Apple matcha pie, anyone? Or apple fritters with an apple matcha icing...yes, please! I make homemade donuts occasionally...can you imagine a big apple cake donut covered in cinnamon sugar? I may have to make donuts in the near future. I hope this matcha lives up to all of the plans I have for it. And I hope it gives me the energy to follow through on those plans! Because now that I've mentioned it, if I don't make donuts in the near future, my wife will be devastated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is just not for me. The smell of the dry matcha has the smell of the more bitter matchas I've had from Red Leaf Tea, and that smell carried through into the taste of the brewed tea. It tastes something like apple candy when you power through the bitterness, which is nice, but far from the apple juice I was craving. I'm not an apple candy type of girl, unless it's a sour apple. It might still be good as a latte, but I won't be cooking with it, sadly. Still it isn't terrible, and the bitterness seems to fade over time. Maybe it will still hold up to donuts, as the amount of sugar in them will balance out the bitterness. I don't really think this is one I need to get more of, and if any of my local friends want a taste, I'm happy to share. I'll experiment with what I have left, maybe I can find a way to fall in love with this tea. But personally I'm going to stick with the Green Apple matcha, also from Red Leaf Teas.

review/summary: Tastes like Strawberry Ice Cream, but the charm is in the crispy texture and delicate slenderness
review/text: Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The flavor of the strawberry (which I prefer to the chocolate) is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar), but a serving (five pocky sticks) is 70 calories. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge. But if you can stick to just a few at a time, you can easily have a fun Japanese snack for 100 or fewer calories (figure 14 or 15 calories per stick).<br /><br />If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds  him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.

review/text: I first discovered Pocky Biscuit Sticks a few months ago, They're somewhat like a long pretzel (without salt) where one end has been dipped in a fudge-like candy. They're an interesting treat and, because they individually come in small portions, I like to use them as treats for my young (4 years) boy. The first ones I discovered were chocolate. This last time I decided to try the strawberry. I'd have to say that I prefer the chocolate. My boy shows no preference for one or the other.<br /><br />Gary Petesron

review/summary: Always good stuff.  Reasonably priced.
review/text: Pocky is a great snack.  It's crunchy and not too sweet.  It's similar to a bread stick dipped in chocolate (or strawberry in this case).  Strawberry pocky has a strawberry yogurt type of taste to it.  I rather enjoy it.<br /><br />The strawberry pocky is far more reasonably priced over the chocolate pocky on amazon.  Be careful not to ship in hot weather or you will end up with one giant pock.

review/summary: Love it
review/text: These were given to us at our local Thai restaurant because our son (20 months) wouldn't stop whining or sit still in his high chair. The staff gave it to us and he loved them! They're great because they're light and slightly sweet and just the right size for toddler who can chew. I absolutely recommend as a snack on the go.
