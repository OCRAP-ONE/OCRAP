review/summary: great coffee
review/text: So far, of all the decaf Kcups we have tried, this is our favorite.  Wish it were on the automatic ordering system.  Coffee is such an individual like or dislike but when we use it with an 8oz cup of water it is great.

review/summary: Wolfgang Puck Decaf can't miss!
review/text: When I feel that I do not need more caffine, I have found that the Wolfgang Puck Decaf is a great substitute.  I really can't tell the difference, taste wise.  I had been having trouble finding a good decaf.  I think this one is it.

review/summary: What a great cup of coffee
review/text: Sometimes I feel when I reach for a decaffeinated K-cup that I'm going to settle for less flavor. However, I'm completely happy with this product. I don't feel I'm missing anything. Everyday I treat myself to a relaxing cup of coffee after work before starting dinner. This product just fits  what I'm looking for.

review/summary: My Favorite K-Cup
review/text: My wife and I have decided hands down, this is our favorite K-cup. We've tried a lot of others, and Donut Shop and Caribu Daybreak are certainly still up there. However, this has a very solid body flavor with a medium roast. Almost a bold flavor with a smooth finish. Excellent flavor versus strength. Really nice to get up on a lazy Sunday morning and have a nice cup of Breakfast in Bed!<br /><br />Also, I see another reviewer had problems with messy K-cups. I can say after about 6 boxes of theses, I haven't had any issues. Very unfortunate for the other reviewer, but looks like it was rather isolated.<br /><br />Give it a try, you'll certainly enjoy it, the wife and I sure do!

review/summary: Unremarkable
review/text: First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.

review/summary: Not my favorite
review/text: Of all the K-Cup flavors that are out there, and there are many very good ones, this is one of my least favorites, and I have tried almost all of them.  Not much flavor to this one, even if you add various types of creamers.  Of course, it is all a matter of taste, but this one doesn't taste all that good.  It is not bad - it is just kind of there - like a generic coffee.  Try something else instead.

review/summary: Jamaica Me Happy!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Jamaica Me Crazy coffee.  There was a time in my life when I was totally caffeine free and off the dark stuff, but a customer in the bank I worked at brought in a pound of this coffee as a gift to the tellers.  Every time someone walked by my desk with a cup of this freshly made joe, the smell would really tempt me to go back to consuming coffee again.  Eventually it broke me down, and I am back to being a full time coffee drinker, and proud of it! Imagine how happy I was to find my favorite brew in a K-cup!  The only thing better than a cup of Jamica Me Crazy is a cup sweetened with the new Almond Joy flavor International Creamer in it to highlight the sweet coconut.  Unfortunately, we only have a Keurig at our office (I'm in Real Estate now), so I have to go to work to enjoy a cup.  I'm thinking I have a brilliant boss who knows how to get people to willingly show up to work! Now if I can just figure a way to use it to temp more buyers into our office - I'd have it made ;0)

I have gotten many different kinds of the k-cups to try but after trying this one, I think I could be happy with just this one and black tiger for those mornings when I want a really strong cup of coffee.  The rodeo drive blend is delicious with a nice round feel on the palate and an interesting flavor on the finish with just a hint of smokiness.  Perfectly balanced and absolutely wonderful!  Plus, I have to admit...I love the label. The different color looks very appealing on my carousel with the other k-cups.

review/text: For years, I've been completely devoted to Dunkin Donuts brewed at the store and at home.  I tried brewing DD in my K cup and I also bought the Eco Brew and the actual DD k cups.  Awful!  So I was searching high and low for a new coffee.  After trying all the decaf k cups on the market, I finally found and loved Wolfgang Puck decaf coffee k cups.  This is the only place I can find them so I hope Amazon never stops selling them here.  They are mellow, medium roast and I enjoy them every day.  Any other brand is just a back up.  Try them.  I have never had any trouble with any of the cups and I'm on my third order now of 48 cups.  If they had a problem, they've fixed it.<br /><br />This is an update being done on July 7, 2012.  I continue to drink at least two cups of this coffee EVERY day.  It has ruined me for other coffees as I measure every other cup against this incredible Wolfgang Puck Decaf k cup.  Please, please, PLEASE Amazon, make this part of your subscription service.  My head hurts trying to make sure that I always remember to order so as not to ever be out of this wonderful coffee.

review/summary: Great, but not perfect
review/text: I roast my own Colombian beans at home so I have a perfect "10" for reference. Right off the bat let me say that just like their Sumatran reserve, this k-cup is not bitter, but smooth. The aftertaste is also smooth. My chief complaint is it does not taste like a Colombian bean. It really is missing the deep flavor of a columbian coffee, while the Sumatran Puck K-cup definitely has a Sumatran taste. The "8 oclock" brand you see in many grocery stores has a more distinct flavor than this k-cup. That being said, my final recommendation is that I would recoommend the Puck Sumatran over this if you like a distinct coffee flavor. However, if you are looking for a not-too-stong-but-not-bitter coffee, this Colombian is a great choice. I would buy this again just because of the smooth taste.

review/text: I've always been drawn to K-Cup varieties with out there names (Jet Fuel, Black Tiger) and distinctive flavors (Golden French Toast, Spicy Mayan Chocolate). This offering melds those two features into something I'm happy to wake up to!<br /><br />To me, Jamaica Me Crazy's definitely got a pervasive coconut taste fairly similar to Dunkin' Donuts coconut flavored coffee, but it's also got a lot of the flavor characteristics I've come to expect from K-Cup chocolate brews. Barely any of that acidic aftertaste that's almost inevitable with artificial flavors, and definitely not as watery as many other K-cup varieties. Sure, the name's pretty corny and the taste is hardly subtle or sophisticated, but that's what makes this cup of joe so fun!

review/summary: Ok, but not the same type of crunch...
review/text: I love dill pickles & I like that they're a food that is diet friendly- not a lot of fat or calorie content, although the sodium could be better. So when I saw that there's a 4 pack of mini dills, I thought they'd make a nice contribution to my lunch. They were nice, but there were just a few things about them that I didn't like.<br /><br />First off, there's not a lot of crunch. I wasn't expecting these to be as crunchy as the bigger pickles or pickle slices, but the first pack I ate had absolutely no crunch, which means that they must have been pickled a while ago. (The longer a pickle sits, the more it will be saturated by the brine, I guess.) The second pack had more crunch, but not a whole lot more.<br /><br />The taste of the pickles were fine, but the lack of crunch sort of killed it for me. In the end, I don't think that I'll be picking these up again unless there's a huge sale on them at my local store. The product was fine enough to be "ok", but not good enough to be great.

So since I'm trying to keep the calories down, I really can't order anymore for a while, if ever.  But if you love peanuts and you want to try the best, then poney up and pay for them.

review/summary: Excellent unsalted. Really.
review/text: I was skeptical about ordering the unsalted version. But I have long since cut back on salt use, and I have become very sensitive to foods that are salty. These are very flavorful and I am surprised I do not miss the added salt. I looked at google maps at the company's address, looks like a real farm surrounded by fields, not just some warehouse for processing. These are well packed in a sturdy tin with the vacuum sealed by stiff foil under the lid. I have decided to get more via subscribe and save.  I do a fair amount of weight training, so these are a good source of protein (25%, more than any other nut, though this technically not a nut but a legume), and the oil within the peanut is relatively healthy (mostly mono- and polyunsaturated fats). You just have to watch out for calories, they are rich, even the company web site suggests 1 oz per day, not by the handful. I use an expresso cup to not over eat them. They sure are good.

Apparently the cats have spoken, so order it on Amazon........3 cases at a time and your cat will have a beautiful coat and a healthy digestive system. And so will you if you run out of food. I think you could even put it in a fondue pot and pass crackers around. Your guests would never dream it was cat food and think you were the best gourmet cook ever.

They've recently changed the recipe, as the bars taste slightly less "dark-chocolatey," but they're still delicious. Don't be confused by the toasted almond label. There are very few tiny slivers of almonds, and the bars honestly taste more like a dark chocolate rice crispy bar than anything with nuts. Overall, I prefer these to all other gluten free bars. If only they were slightly less expensive!

review/summary: Sweet & savory treat -- without artificial ingredients
review/text: Royal Oak Peanuts' gourmet toffee coated Virginia peanuts are a perfect after-dinner complement to a hot cup of coffee or black tea. I am not suggesting this sweet and savory treat qualifies as a health food but the sparseness of the ingredient list - peanuts, sugar, butter and salt - surprised me.<br /><br />What?!? No food colorings? No propyl gallate? No butylated hydroxyanisole?<br /><br />Nope. Just peanuts, sugar, butter and salt; so, you can share these peanuts with your children without being concerned about artificial ingredients.<br /><br />Our order arrived in on time, in excellent condition and fresh. According to the FAQ at the Royal Oak Peanuts' website, "all vacuum-sealed tins have a shelf life of 6 to 9 months." The recommendation on the can reads, "For prolonged freshness & good taste, refrigerate or freeze after opening."<br /><br />A small amount of toffee coating sloughs off during shipping (I suppose you could knock off more if you set it in a paint can mixer...but you get the point.) Again, this is a minor issue and I wouldn't trade these butter toffee peanuts for a brand that adds a chemical adhesive.<br /><br />One final note: this product is toffee coated peanuts not peanut brittle, so if you prefer a higher candy-to-peanuts ratio, I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6BC2">Royal Oak Gourmet Peanut Brittle</a> instead.<br /><br />Rating: five stars.

The advertised picture shown is a larger size(1 oz), but what was actually sent was much smaller(0.5 oz). We could have gotten 50% more of the same exact product for less. We paid $10.79 for 0.5 oz when we could have paid $9.15 for 1oz. Product itself is great and our cat loves it, we just overpaid and lesson learned.

review/summary: This dogfood is great!
review/text: I started using Holistic Select when I got an English Mastiff puppy because it was well recommended by a number of breeders. Georgia, the puppy, did so well on their food I decided, two years ago, to try the Senior food for our elderly Golden Retriever. Soccer had been on Purina Dog Chow all his life. He was really starting to act and show his age. He was overweight, slowing down, and getting gimpy from laying around too much. What a difference!! Now he is much more trim, playful again, and actually runs around the yard - at 13!! The only difference has been the change in food so I give Holistic Select complete credit for this remarkable transformation. I discovered that I could buy Holistic Select products from Amazon about a year ago. Their price is a few bucks cheaper than the pet stores where I was buying and delivery is free! Since I live in a rural county, this saves me driving to "the big city" to get their dog food. Having it delivered makes my life much easier!!

review/summary: refreshing tea with a peach flavor but some ingredients may be concerning
review/text: I don't have a problem getting my 8 glasses of water each day but I sometimes like a little beverage diversity and individually packaged drink packs are a good way to add a bit of a kick to water. Because these are individual packets, it is easy to keep a few in a gym bag, work desk or purse. I think the flavor is decent. The peach iced tea flavor, in my opinion, is not as good as Wyler's pink lemonade, but it is still a favorite. I purchase Wyler's peach iced tea at my local grocery store for about 10 cents a packet.<br /><br />Some individuals may be concerned to know that this product has aspartame and acesulfame potassium. A lot of diet beverages, including powdered beverage sticks made by Crystal Light and Hawaiian Punch, use these additives. Both have been linked to cancer in rats and both were deemed one of the top ten worst additives by the Center for Science in the Public Interest. So, if you are cautious about additives in your food, this product may not be for you. A serving for this product is 1/2 of a packet and 1/2 of a packet has 5 calories and 10% of your daily vitamin C. To make a full, sufficiently flavored 16 ounce glass, you really do need the entire packet.<br /><br />For proper dissolution of the powder, it is best to follow the recommendation on the box and place the powder into something that can be shaken. Some companies make products that dissolve pretty well when stirred with a spoon or straw. This product is not one of them.<br /><br />If you are seeking an alternative product that does not utilize these controversial ingredients and has more vitamins, I would recommend the powered beverages that are made by NOW Foods, including Acai Lemonade <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I573FS">Acai Lemonade Sugar Free Drink Sticks 1.7 oz sticks 12 Sticks</a> and Sugar Free Drink Sticks <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I58XNO">Sugar Free Drink Sticks Pomegranate Berry 12 pckts</a> . (The company actually has several other flavors but I wouldn't recommend them at present.) NOW's flavored beverage packets are somewhat pricey but can be found more economically off of Amazon (iherb.com and at local health food stores). NOW's Acai Lemonade, which is my favorite, has 15 calories and is loaded with vitamins. It has 100% of you daily vitamin C, 25% of Vitamin A, 50% of Vitamin D, 50% of Vitamin E, 50% of Thiamin, 50% of Riboflavin, 25% of Niacin, 50% of B-6, 50% of Folate, 50% of Pantothenic Acid and 1670% of Vitamin B-12.<br /><br />Wyler's peach iced tea is flavorful, easy to pack and can be very economical. Those who want to avoid sugar substitutes may want to use this product in moderation or steer clear.

review/summary: Decent Brew
review/text: Prince of Peace Peony White is better classified as a Shou Mei grade of tea. It forms a relatively dark brew in the cup, reminiscent of a green tea or perhaps an Oolong. Nevertheless, its taste is smooth and pleasing with little astringency. All in all, this a good deal on a decent cup of tea - but if you're looking for a true white tea, you should search elsewhere.

review/summary: A decent-tasting white tea
review/text: For a convenient tea in a teabag, this is a good buy, largely due to a lack of bagged white tea availability in most locales.  White tea is believed to be even more beneficial than green tea in some ways, and can have quite a bit less caffeine then green or black if the tea is immature enough.<br /><br />For most of this year, I have been using bulk teas (silver needles and rooibos) with a Swissgold infuser--all purchased from Amazon.  I now notice the paper taste on normal teas I once thought were perfectly fine.  That said, the flavor from the paper in this tea is not too bad, and thankfully, the floral-fruity tea flavor comes out okay.  The bag uses unbleached filter paper and the tea is organic.<br /><br />I find a sweetener and a brewing temperature under 180 degrees helps this tea.  Another reviewer stated this white tea produces a darker tea, and I definitely find this to be true.<br /><br />As with Silver Needles, I find I can focus better on work or study.  This effect starts within twenty minutes of drinking.  However, Silver Needles seems to produce no jittery "caffeine" effect while this one can a bit.  I have had other white peony teas that have no caffeine "jittery-effect", but these are ones I've had at good cafes, and they were bulk, but pricier teas.<br /><br />A higher-grade, better tasting white tea, Silver Needles, is also available on Amazon.  We get the Davidson's Tea Silver Needles in bulk.  If you are looking for a pure white tea with no flavorings of any sort, this White Peony and the Davidson's are the two to try.<br /><br />The Davidson's Tea Silver Needles is here:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SANUEK">Davidson's Tea Bulk, Silver Needles, 16-Ounce Bag</a>

review/summary: Good value, great for your health
review/text: I'm not naturally drawn to any tea, but for health reasons I've been trying to pick it up for years, mostly trying green teas.  I never could make a habit of it until I found a small box of this locally.  In the past 5 months, I've averaged 4 cups a day and have officially developed a positive habit.  I'm still not in love with the taste, though I find white tea easier to stomach than some green teas that were grassier, but I do enjoy the experience of drinking white tea and I enjoy its effects.  Rather than a caffeine buzz, teas have a balance of caffeine and l-theanine that provide mental clarity and aid focus, the balance in white tea is just right for me.<br /><br />POP white tea brews darker than a more costly white tea I was given, and I do suspect that darker color means lower quality, but the price is right.  The bags also brew more cups than an equivalent bag of black tea, furthering the value.  I have no trouble getting 6 large cups of tea from a single bag, and arguably, the second cup is better than the first.  I'm on my second box of 100, and have recently discovered another listing of the same tea here that offers subscribe and save, I'm likely to buy much more in the future.  How many good habits are this affordable?

review/text: I feel extremely cheated after trying this tea. I bought the Oolong tea and decided to give this white tea a try since it had so much good reviews. The tea tastes, smells and looks exactly like the oolong tea. White tea should have a clearer look to it but this was just a rip off after spending almost $8 on it. Next time I'll stick to the Lipton white tea cause I just feel so wronged. Oh well guess I learnt my lesson buying tea online.

review/summary: Great if you're looking for lower caffeine
review/text: I'm a former coffee drinker who's moved to tea.  I was finding that coffee was just getting me too tense.  I drink a lot of Earl Grey.  But I heard about white tea, I hadn't know about it before.  It has lower caffeine than even green tea, and quite a bit less than an earl grey or black.  It also is supposed to have a lot of antioxidants.<br /><br />I'm finding this tea to taste more like a black tea than a green.  Green has a grassy taste to me.  The thing I really like is I can continue having several cups without getting an overload of caffeine.  If that's what you're looking for, I'd recommend it.  The price is right, too!

review/summary: Some of the best white tea i've had... but there's a catch.
review/text: I've tried many organic white teas before but this one is definitely a favorite of mine. The aroma isn't the best but it tastes great. The catch to this great tea is that it's not "pure" white tea so to speak. Due to the nature of white peony tea, (1 bud and 2 tips) it really ends up being a mixture between green tea and white tea. However this is not a problem for me because I think it makes it taste better than other white teas, while still being very good for your health. It brews plenty strong for white tea so you won't be disappointed. the 100 pack at $7 is a great value!

Small caffeine boost, great flavor, no calories, etc. Read about white teas online so I gave this a try. The price is incredible. The tea reminds me of a tea I drank at a Chinese restaurant when I was young. Brings back good childhood memories, love the flavor. WILL BUY AGAIN.

review/summary: Prince of Peace puts only about half as much tea in each tea bag as Bigelow does
review/text: The only defect I could find was that Prince of Peace brand puts only about half as much tea in each of its tea bags as other brands such as Bigelow brand.  This shouldn't be a problem for people trying to brew just one pint of tea with one tea bag.  However, if you have been happy brewing a half gallon of tea with just one Bigelow tea bag, then you may need to use two Prince of Peace tea bags per half gallon of boiling water to get the same quality of tea.  One gram of white tea has more catechins and more polyphenols than one gram of green tea (please click "Comment" below).  If green tea is stronger than oolong tea and white tea is stronger than green tea, then what would be stronger than white tea?  Rooibos tea?  No.  Honeybush tea?  No.  Olive leaf tea?  Yes!  Live long and prosper.

review/summary: POP White Peony tastes great,
review/text: I am not an expert on teas. I've been drinking grocery-store-bought green tea(Wegman's Brand) for years. I thought I'd try the POP White Peony Tea(Bai Mudan) for additional antioxidant power and to reduce the consumption of fluoride that green tea contains. So I bought four 100-bag boxes. In making my first cup of White Peony, I noticed right away how dark brown the brew was. Is this characteristic of all Bai Mudan teas?  in the past, I would brew two bags of the green tea within one cup of water (and steep it forever at high temps) and it would still only make an amber brew. But only one tea bag of the White Peony after a few minutes of steeping, makes for a dark tea similar to black tea. Again, I am not an expert. Just stating my observations. Is White Peony supposed to be that dark? Thanks, Wayne
