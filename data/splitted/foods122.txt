review/summary: Great Treat
review/text: My dogs love this treat. I use it to train them and just for fun. The nice thing about this product is that if you want the pieces to be smaller, it's easy to cut them up without it crumbling apart. Also, it was a great deal.

review/summary: dogs love these!
review/text: My two boxes absolutely LOVE these freeze dried liver treats; it is one of their favorites.  Both dogs do their kidney bean dances in the kitchen when we take the lid off.  The only bad thing is the treats are small and they only recommend a few daily.  (But, I guess that's not too much of a bad thing given these are a little pricer than the average dog treat)

review/summary: Delicious for the Dog
review/text: I must say that my dog and all at the dog park LOVE these treats. Even the very fussy boxer sniffs at my pocket waiting for them. The sizes are quite variable which is ok.<br /><br />The product arrived with no protective covering on either the outside of the tub or under the lid which bothered me a bit (not sure if they had been open, returned by someone, then sent to us) so that is why I rated 3 stars.<br /><br />The amount of product for the price is great!<br />I would most likely purchase again.

review/summary: Great treat to use as a high value reward!
review/text: My 4 month old aussie loves these! Whenever he's fixated on something (like another dog while we're on a walk), I quickly wave it near his head to redirect his attention. It's one of the only treats that can bring his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze-dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training). They aren't especially smelly, but some dogs can smell them yards away. I've been followed many times at the dog park by doggies that smell the leftover powder in my jacket pocket!<br /><br />The downside is that when I cut it into too small of a piece, it can crumble apart. Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool. The tub says that only a few should be fed per day, and it is to my understanding that too much liver isn't good for the dog. I've uploaded a picture of the feeding guidelines that are printed on the side of my 21oz tub and I'll also provide them here:<br />-------------------------------<br />Weight........................3 Times Daily<br />-------------------------------<br />10-30lbs....................1 to 2<br />30-60lbs....................2 to 4<br />over 60lbs..................4 to 6<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />So, for example, for a 60lb dog, about 4 pieces can be fed up to three times each day. Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces. I hope I'm not missing something here?<br /><br />I've also uploaded a photo of the front of the 21oz tub showing that it is made in the USA. It has a May 2, 2014 expiration date printed on the underside of the container.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!

review/summary: This it like dog heroin.  There's nothing my dog won't do for liver treats.
review/text: I've been using Freeze Dried Liver treats to train and reward my dogs for about 20 years.  It is like dog heroin for my dogs, there is nothing they won't do for these treats.  It makes training a breeze.  My current dog, Samson, will sit in front of the pantry and drool until I give him a treat.  The treats are expensive so I cut them in quarters so they last longer.  These are 100% meat, no scrap or filler.  These are the only treats I give Samson, my Rottweiler.  You can't go wrong with these treats.

review/text: These are a great deal when compared to the small bags of treats available at the pet store. More importantly, my dog adores them. I use them as an extra special treat, usually just for when he goes into his crate. As soon as he notices that I have one in my hand, he runs to his crate and waits, tail wagging. The only downside is that the liver cubes smell horrible (to humans, anyway) and leave a powdery residue behind. But as some other reviews have noted, the powder is great for sprinkling on dry food for a finicky dog.

review/summary: Great treat, but probably not for small dogs
review/text: These treats are similar to the PureBites, however, since I have small dogs (Peke mix), I generally don't give them these snacks because they are more suited for medium and large dogs (or small dogs with large mouths). Smaller dogs have a hard time biting down on them and there is the possibility of choking because the pieces are too large and dense for their small mouths, so I have to break them up into smaller pieces before I give them to my doggies. The PureBites, on the other hand, are flatter and easier for them to chew. The snacks appear to made in the same way, so if I had larger dogs, I would give them either this snack or the PureBites.

review/text: Our two dogs love this product, and we love the fact that it's not loaded with chemical preservatives and fillers.  The fact that the pieces are irregular is not a drawback and is not surprising.  I do cut up the larger pieces as I don't want to give them too much at once.  The prospect of getting one of these treats makes them much more receptive to training and just coming when you call.  Also, we find the largest size very economical as you don't pay for shipping.

review/text: My 2 year old German Shepherd loves this treat.  I keep it on my counter as a quick and handy treat for "mini, spontaneous training sessions".  The only issue I have is that most of the treats are a bit big and difficult to break into smaller pieces which is necessary for obedience classes where we go through many treats.  Therefore, I do not use these treats for that purpose.  (The container recommends only 3-4 cubes per day for large dogs).  Having said that, they are an excellent treat for occasional use and I would highly recommend them.

review/text: By far this treat is the best one that I have bought.  We used it to crate train out puppy and whenever he saw us going for the bucket or smelled it being opened he would run for his crate and sit in there until we gave him this treat.  The large bucket is the most economicay, but it does have a really strong odor when you open it; for that reason we always keep a small ziploc with the treats in it that we use regularly and only open the bin to refill that bag.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the sizes of the treats varies incredibly - but if one is too large we just split it, we will give 2 of the small ones, and the powder and bits at the end just go in his dinner one night for an added treat!

review/summary: Chef Paul Prudhomme's Best Seasoning
review/text: I've been experimenting with Cajun food for quite sometime. I've talked with several different Creole Chefs and two of the three that I have spoked with have recommended this seasoning over any other. From now on, this is the only Creole seasoning I use on any meat. I've bought the variety pack of Chef Paul Prudhomme's seasonings, and nothing really stuck out like this one. If you have been using Chef Paul Prudhomme's seasonings, and haven't purchased this one, you are in for a treat. I can't find this specific product in the stores, which makes the 24-oz can a great buy.

review/text: This is my go-to seasoning blend now. I wish I had discovered it sooner! I use it on everything...including fish, chicken, pork, shrimp, burgers, steak, potatoes, veggies, and in dry rubs, marinades, soups and stews. I've even been tempted to top my ice cream with it, but so far have been able to restrain myself! :-) For a blackening seasoning, I find it has a nice all-around blend of seasonings, herbs and spices without being too over-the-top spicy or peppery. Flavor is key here...not "melt your face off" heat.<br /><br />The larger cansiter is a much better bargain than the little 2 ounce containers, in my opinion. Amazon also has the 2-pack 24 ounce cansiters, and it's what I usually order when I'm running low. If you've never tried this stuff before, pick up the 2 ounce size to see how you like it...when you realize how good it is, you'll be glad Amazon has the big cansiters.

review/text: I consider myself a big fan of both Reese's and Whoppers so I was excited when I saw this new product.  However, after going through one box over a few days, I find this to be a major disappointment.  The product is very waxy and doesn't have enough peanut butter taste (package says "Peanut Butter Flavored" which should have been a red flag to begin with).  Maybe this product could be improved if the company 1) adds real peanut butter and 2) tries a double-layer coating of chocolate and peanut butter since this is the winning combination for the famous Reese's peanut butter cups.

review/summary: Lovely orchid
review/text: This orchid arrived in good shape.  I was a little skeptical as to the "blooming size," but they were right...it bloomed 9 months after arriving, with 3 big, beautiful blooms...not bad for a first-time bloomer.  And the colors are outstanding!

review/summary: Best cheese curls - UPDATED: overpriced and poor quality
review/text: I won't say I'm an expert in cheese curls, but these sure taste great. Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Amazon price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective.<br /><br />UPDATE December 11, 2009<br />Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag "freshness guaranteed." That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients). I'd give this one star today if I could.

review/summary: Five stars for the cheese flavored puffs
review/text: I'd give it three stars for the approximately 50% of puffs that have little or no cheese on them, and five stars for the ones that have a lot (maybe too much?). I have been eating Michael Seasons puffs and curls for at least two years and can't help but notice how their production has shifted from full-flavored to light-flavored (after which I wrote the company) to mixed-flavored. It seems they produce one batch of light and one batch of full flavored and then mix the two. Are they expecting nobody to notice? At least my wife loves to pick out the light flavored puffs leaving me the full flavored creating a kind of bonding experience if you will, but if I were eating this by myself I'd be annoyed. Still, because they contain at least partially organic ingredients, and because they taste so well overall, there's no other brand that beats them so I keep ordering anyway.

review/text: My husband and I went Gluten Free earlier this year due to a health condition.  We stumbled across this product at Whole Foods and decided to try it.  These were incredible...  so cheesy and spicy!!!  So much so, we decided to buy a case on Amazon.  Once our original case was depleted, we re-ordered, and though the product looks identical, the new case contained cheese curls with little to no seasoning.  They were so bland that we had no desire to eat them.  We opened each bag in the case hoping some of them would be good like the first case we purchased, but to our dismay, we ended up tossing the entire case.  We will not be buying these again.  What a letdown...

Your basketball players don't make every shot, your football players don't make every touch down. Are you whining at them or their coach? No. You deal with it, because despite the flaws, you like them.

review/summary: Amazing cheeze curls
review/text: I tried many times to find a replacement for Planters Cheeze Curls (now they discontinued it). And I think that is a perfect replacement. May be not only perfect but better than original from Planters. So, there is lot of cheeze powder on it and size is right and it's so delicious that when you'll put one curl in to you mouth you will involuntarily draw the next two.<br /><br />I'll recommend it for everyone who loved old time Planters Cheeze Curls - it's good and probably better.<br /><br />P.S.: I love them so much so I order them to Russia - total cost with delivery is about 75 dollars!

review/summary: OMG These are the Best Cheese Snacks!
review/text: I found this brand of cheese snacks at a Whole Foods store in Manhattan and I've been hooked ever since. Unfortunately, WF started carrying their own brand of cheese puffs and stopped selling Michael Season's. Thank goodness for Amazon.com!<br /><br />I like these so much that I ordered a case and had them delivered to my office. Now all my office mates are getting hooked. These taste amazing for being "lite", and they have a decent amount of fiber per serving (and relatively low fat/calories). They are all natural, and highly addictive!<br /><br />I've tried the regular variety of Michael Season's Cheese Puffs, and I do not recommend them because they're too rich. The Lite variety taste perfectly cheesey without being too buttery in flavor.<br /><br />Makes an awesome afternoon snack!

I am not a fan of the flavor I had. Or better yet the lack of flavor. These tasted like health food more than I had hoped ( Like rice cakes ) and I wanted to write a 1 star review but felt it somewhat dishonest as the other flavor may be ok, others seem to like these but I will never try another and still have so many bags left.

review/text: I have a Lhasa Apso. She goes through bully sticks in a day at $3-5 a pop. I'm a senior on a fixed budget, and all of it can't be going to dog chews. I've tried pretty much everything. Having a small dog limits many options because her mouth just can't fit arund some products. This product is great. Because it is round and braided, large chunks don't break off, eliminating concerns about rawhide chews. She is able to both chew it and carry it around easily. And one of these lasts at least a month. I had been buying a similar product in my local Petco, but it cost $3 more. I am totally happy with this product and would highly recommend it for smaller breeds.

After much anticipation, waiting for it's arrival, and then finally opening up the (cheap plastic) jar and putting some on a piece of bread to try it with.... it tasted like wall spackle. Ok, I've never eaten wall spackle, but I'm pretty sure it tastes like "lite" baconnaise. Then I realized after careful examination of the label that I ordered the "lite." Dammit.<br /><br />Determined to finally taste the ORIGINAL baconnaise, I went back on amazon and (very carefully) ordered the ORIGINAL baconnaise. And it's pretty dang good! I'll leave a review of the original, non-lite product there.

review/text: When I saw the add, I knew I wanted to try it.  I already have a mixed selection of the Bacon Salt.  Good flavor, what I expected...but don't overdue it and it is better. Great on fries and mix it with a little lite mayo or sour cream for a salad dressing or dip.  I will accept that it isn't as creamy as mayo, and it has a kinda lite,gritty texture almost,if you taste it by itself.  Try it with peanut butter on toast.  My problem is my brother, he uses mayo on everything and he loves it, so I hide a jar just for myself.  It does have a pretty strong smokey bacon flavor by itself.

review/text: Hey Bacon Lovers,<br /><br /> The original BACONNAISE is absolutely delicious!  There is NOTHING else like it on store shelves!  No, I am not the maker of this product or associated with it in any way other than being a HAPPY CUSTOMER!  YUMMMY!<br /><br />  The LITE Baconnaise, just like most calorie restricted products, doesn't taste as great as the original, fattier Baconnaise!  I suggest you go to J&D's website & buy the original BACONNAISE and not the lite variety.<br /><br />  I was hooked on FAST FOOD, especially McDonald's Big Macs!  I got a jar of original Baconnaise (looks darker than the lite jar that is pictured here)  after seeing it featured on Oprah.  It was LOVE AT FIRST BITE!<br /><br /> Although it's NOT a diet food, I have lost almost 10 pounds in only 3 weeks because I'd rather eat at home using my Baconnaise than grab something at the drive-thru!  I especially like a lean Roast Beef sandwich with Baconnaise.<br /><br />No fast food means no french fries or super sized Coke, so I think that's why I'm dropping the pounds!  Financially, we're saving a lot of CASH $$$ because I have DISCOVERED something that makes me SATISFIED with what I'm putting in my mouth.  Does that make sense?  Seriously, it costs us about $20 a fast food meal & we used to eat out several times a week.  We still do pizza every so often, but fast food has lost its allure!<br /><br />  I even went so far as to dab on some Baconnaise on a stalk of (ugh) broccoli yesterday & it was EAT-ABLE for once!  I can assure you I am NOT a veggie eater AT ALL!  Thanks to this tasty product, I now have hope that I can break my ADDICTION to fast food.  Even eating some veggies is NOW a possibility (almost an unbelievable statement from a junque food junkie!)<br /><br />  I took the time to write this because I could NOT believe the negative reviews and wanted to CLARIFY for all of those thinking about trying Baconnaise to purchase the ORIGINAL Baconnaise formula.  It has HELPED ME a great deal & I am now hooked for life!<br /><br /> Good Luck & Happy Eats! :D

review/text: This jar of light coral goo is filed in the back of the fridge with "one-recipe" stuff and other exotica.  It is waiting there for me to admit that my curiosity and desire for novelty beat back my better judgement. In a blind-tasting, "bacon" would not be my first reaction and the texture is slimy and unappealing (room temp or cold).

review/summary: Lite Baconnaise is pretty tasty!
review/text: This is more like a flavored spread than a true mayo replacement, I would not advise using it in Potato salad or tuna fish. It is very tasty as a veggie dip and as an admittedly rich burrito topping.

review/summary: Good for being lite
review/text: I was surprised how many haters there are for the Lite version. Disclaimer: I've never tried the full fat version and I'm sure it's delicious, but if you're watching your fat intake, there has to be some compromise.  I saw this at the grocery store next to the regular Baconnaise.<br />Lite version: 2.5 grams fat per 2 Tbl.<br />Original version: 9 grams fat per 2 Tbl.<br /><br />I'm used to eating lite variations (though not fat free, yuck) of sour cream, mayo, salad dressing, etc.  So this wasn't a big leap for me. First sandwich, I was not impressed. Second sandwich, meh. By the third sandwich I was hooked. When by bottle ran out I had a hard time going back to plain mayo. I've been eating it so much that I don't even want to try the fattier version b/c then I'll be eating even more, yikes!<br /><br />It may not be a good taste for everyone, and I can understand that. But it's yummy to me :-)

review/text: Bought this and the regular for a friend's birthday present. Purchased the 3 pack - My friend saw a review of this on Oprah - Can't find it in stores... so I tried this - It is a bit strong - had to mix in more light mayo with it... I am waiting for my tomatoes to come in for a Tomato and Baconnaise sandwich - that will be the TRUE TEST!!<br />So far my review is this - Not bad -but it is strong. You may have to mix it with more mayo like I did.

review/summary: Ok
review/text: I saw this product on Oprah and wanted to try it, I was impressed that it was vegetarian and lower fat then mayo. I thought it would make good "BLT's", but without the real beacon. It was just OK for me. The product does come as described and tastes OK, but something about it just tasted too fake and I didn't like the texture. It's not real creamy lake mayo, or even low-cal mayo. I like low-cal fry sauce a lot better. I have to say though, it's just a taste thing, and someone else might love it. I still use it on burgers, (mixed with light mayo), but no one in my family really cares for it that much.<br />I wasn't happy that with free shipping it took a month before it was even sent out, that seemed a little ridiculous. The packaging was good. I like that the jars are plastic and not glass. However, I would not purchase again or recommend, because the flavor is just OK.

review/text: This product is pretty nasty. AND you have to get three jars at once. We ended up putting one in the fridge to be ignored indefinitely and the other two will go as gag gifts. It tastes a little like the fake bacon bits that you can sprinkle on salads, but nothing like real bacon. The consistency is like the mucus that you hack up when you have a bad chest cold. Perhaps the regular is better, but I wouldn't recommend this product. I ordered the Lite on accident. However, I have been so displeased with the Lite product that I will not bother with another three bottles of the original.

review/summary: First K-Cup coffee I loved.
review/text: A year ago, my dad received a Keurig for Christmas, and with it the K-Cup variety pack. I tried a couple coffee brands without milk and sugar, and this was the one that really caught my taste buds' attention. It's very mild, borderline light-bodied, with a subtle flavor and not too bitter. It doesn't taste like you're chewing on beans, but it's not watered down like some sub-standard brands you find in stores (I'm looking at you Folgers 10lbs jug of "ground").<br /><br />A few months later, a co-worker brought a Keurig to work and offered access to it. I purchased packs of Green Mountain Nantucket Blend the same day and enjoyed 48 cups of it, dreaming of the day I may have a Keurig at home. That has happened now, and I've got this on subscription.<br /><br />Strongly recommend if you are a fan of light-bodied coffee. One of the best K-Cups you'll find in that category.

review/text: I received a box of Nantucket free with my coffee maker but it didn't sound like anything special so I put off trying it, but now it is my favorite!  It is slightly stronger than coffee people coffee shop but has a richer and more flavorful taste.  Not bitter at all, but if you like lighter roasts then you probably will not like this.  I think it tastes best using the 7-8 ounce setting.  This reminds of when I dine out and they have such good coffee but either they don't know or won't tell you what kind it is.  Love it!

review/summary: A saving grace for Green Mountain Coffee...
review/text: When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors.  Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand.  I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee.  We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least.  I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely.  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee.  It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried).  I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods.  Almost.  All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out.  When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!
