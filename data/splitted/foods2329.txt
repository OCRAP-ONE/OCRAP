review/summary: My dog choked on the Edible Bone
review/text: Warning to other dog owners: the edible Nylabones are extremely dangerous for dogs with a big & greedy appetite.  My dog swallowed it whole within 30 seconds of giving it to her and choked on it.  She was fully unconscious before I could dislodge the bone and breathe into her nose to bring her back to life... We almost lost her over this bone.  If your dog is a greedy chewer or eater, then please don't buy edible Nylabones.

review/summary: Good Starter!!
review/text: The Nylabone chews are wonderful for your puppy for about 1 month. We bought a border collie who just loves to chew and  for the 1st month these were perfect for him to start chewing those (Not our shoes, hands, etc.) Once your puppy is about 2 months you might want to get him/her a different style of bone because the beacon flavors once break apart into a million pieces all over the floor. So we had to up grade our pup to an adult chew. But these are great to get your pup started!

review/text: I have a 5.5/6 month year old Bichon Yorkie.  I first put all three of them on the ground.  Naturally he did become much interested in the bacon one.  After noticing how quickly he was getting through it I took it away and he started chewing the others but not as diligently as he did the bacon.  But hey, who doesn't love bacon?!

review/text: Like others have said, dogs will eat the edible bone in a few minutes. My dog will chew on the brown bacon flavored bone like no tomorrow. He loves those and they do last several days for him (Chihuahua) and they were a lifesaver when he was teething. I usually buy that bone by itself.<br /><br />Unfortunately he could care less about the white bone in the middle. Which is why I think it's a better value to just buy the single puppy bone on the left.

review/text: My puppy loves this and this is the perfect thing to distract her from biting us.  Her sharp little teeth have not yet been able to penetrate them and they look like they will last a long time.  However, the edible bone in the packet lasted less than an hour and I was a little concerned that it was too much for her to ingest and ended up taking it away and letting her play with it a little at a time.

review/text: My puppy is teething and LOVES the nylabone. She gnawed on that since the day I brought her home, and over 2 months she finally wore it down to a level where I had to throw it away, for fear she might try to eat/swallow it. She also loved the edible bone in the pack, which I gave to her in two parts over different days, since she's quite small. I haven't introduced the white bone to her yet, she loved the nylabone so much she didn't even pay attention to the other.

review/summary: Puppy Approved!
review/text: My puppy loves all of these bones. She switches back and forth between the white and the brown chew bones, depending on her mood. The white bone is very hard and the brown bone if flexible and softer. The only problem with the edible one is that she eats it too fast. I thought it would last her longer, so I do not purchase the edible ones too often. She also enjoys the blue raised bristle dental nylabone, not pictured in this pack, but found in other packs. But you have to be careful your dog doesn't eat any of the bristles, because she has chewed some of the bristles off. I also recommend the teething keys for teething puppies only. They are not for adult dogs. This is a great starter pack to see what your puppy prefers.

review/summary: Dog likes 2/3, but they are gone in a couple of days
review/text: We got these for our new german shepard mix puppy.  She liked the standard nylabone, and the 'healthy edible' bacon flavored bone, but doesn't care for the white bone.  The two that she liked were gone within a few days each.  The white bone she has spent sometime chewing off and on, but it's still pretty much all there.  The white one seems like a hard plastic, vs the two brown bones were a much softer material.  While the harder bone does last longer, it also seems to be much less attractive for the dog to chew on.

The spicy level is very low - you may need a drink handy if you are eating a few at once.<br /><br />This is a new favorite flavor of mine. Only 2G Net Carbs makes this a perfect snack.

review/summary: Found my ideal recovery drink
review/text: This is as close to a perfect sports drink as I can find.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* When used at the recommendation concentration the solution is 7% carbohydrate. Studies have shown 7-8% is ideal for gastric emptying and absorption rates. Many drinks are much sweeter, which makes the gut draw water from muscles to dilute the mixture. Thankfully that is not the case here.<br />* It mixes very well, and tastes great.<br />* Good price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Only one: it has 200% RDA of vitamin C per serving. Since about 2g of vitamin C in a day is the safe upper limit, that puts a limit on how much you can drink in very long activities.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />* Contains glutamine and BCAAs (2mg per serving). If you have an energy deficit, which you almost certainly will when you drink this, they will probably just be burned as energy.<br /><br />Other drinks all seem to be either a) expensive, b) more sweet than they should be, c) mix poorly and/or taste terrible, or d) full of protein that is not appropriate during or immediately after a workout. I won't be using anything else now that I have found this.

EFS is light and easy to digest, does what it's designed to do and gives me more energy and fuel to push myself harder than if I drank water alone. Also I don't cramp up,or not nearly as much which is a big issue for me on really hard rides or ride and run days. And it even tastes better than all of the others as well. I get the orange and mix some crystal lite with it for more flavor and a little caffiene.

review/summary: Good Taste and Disolves Fast with no after taste.
review/text: The product is great for endurance rides as it does not leave an after taste and the flavoring is light enough to give a hint of the taste. The product dissolves easily in water versus creating chunks in the water bottle. The included scoop gives just the right amount for 20 oz bottle.

review/summary: Not bad tasting
review/text: Since I have only been buying this in Orange it's not fair to compare with other drinks besides Gatorade.<br />The first several times it did take me a while to get use to the taste, but now, it's like drinking anything else.<br />Easy on the stomach.<br />I have went thru 4 tubs (25 servings each), BUT, you don't get 25 servings unless you have a small container bottle. I have to use 1 1/2 scoops for a 18 oz bottle. It does say 1 scoop for 12 oz.<br />I enjoy drinking th Orange flavor. Keep searching around for the best price like I do each time I reorder.<br />Usually I get it for $30.00 and sometime a bit under, and that's counting the shipping charge.

review/summary: Still looking...
review/text: I am a 12 - 24 hr adventure racer.  Every race, after 3-4 hours of strenuous activity, I get leg cramps.  I was hoping the EFS would be my "silver bullet" to put this issue to rest.  I used it in a 12 hr race.  The label says you can mix it up to double strength if needed and I did.  I still cramped around the 3-4 hour time frame.  Pretty sure my case is on the extreme end of the cramping scale, as the guys I train with don't cramp in the races and we train very similarly.

review/summary: The cheese is fantastic - shipping, not so much.
review/text: This is the best cheddar cheese in the world, but over $26.00 for shipping?!  Really?!  That's a little much.  I am now purchasing this cheese for my parents from my local grocery store and sending it for under $10 via the US Post office.  It arrives there just fine and doesn't need all the fancy shipping materials that this company uses to ship from Oregon.  They don't ship in the summer time and even though they don't want it to freeze in the winter, they go a little overboard protecting the cheese.

review/summary: Grape Crystal Light Pure
review/text: I Love several of the Crystal Light Pure flavors. I like that there are NO artificial sweeteners in this product and it has a good flavor. I drink more water since finding these. Note that there are TWO servings in one packet even though they are meant to be used in a bottle of water.  So each packet is 30 Calories and it is meant to be used in a 16.9oz water bottle.  To decrease the calorie per serving I just mix in less product and I find that it still has a good flavor.<br /><br />This is a PRODUCT review, so I will not mark down any stars for the price but I have not purchased this product online because I can consistently find it cheaper in the local grocery store, the "big box" store that starts with a "T", and sometimes even our local dollar store (rare find).  I usually get it for about two dollars a box.<br /><br />Definitely worth a try (from your local store).

review/text: How can you expect sales of a product with no information? No indication of amount, type, pkg, nothing. Does it contain one leaf or one teabag? One pound? How fresh? Organic? For the people who don't like reviews when the product has not been tested: Normally I would agree. But they are selling on Amazon like a professional company without any of the required information. Consider this a review of the amateur, gross inefficiency or, worse, dishonesty of the product sales venue. Amazon should not even allow it here, it downgrades their credibility.

review/summary: Very Best Peanut Butter; But be Sure it is Fresh
review/text: I was served some of these 0.5 oz Heinz Peanut Butter packets in the hospital.  It is absolutely the best peanut butter I have ever tasted.  So, when I got home I purchased a case of the 1.75 oz packets from Amazon.  When they arrived, I opened a couple and discovered that the peanut butter was stale.  I looked on the box and they were a year old.  This was a real disappointment, I don't know if Amazon will take them back.  Great product, but watch out that you don't get a box of old, stale peanut butter, like I did!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00122725Q">Heinz Peanut Butter, 1.75-Ounce Dipping Cup (Pack of 72)</a>

When I took the bag off and put in partial sun, the shoots went far far far up into the bag. Of course, because they want the light. At this time I tried to taper them off, but regardless....the plant died and won't grow.<br /><br />Just go to your local health food store and pick up an already healthy growing plant, save your time and money.

review/summary: I'm addicted...
review/text: These rice crackers are an awesome low calorie snack that packs a nice punch of flavor and are extremely addictive.<br /><br />The crackers themselves are nice, crisp and crunchy, great for when you want something that goes crunch but don't want potato chips or something else that is less then healthy for you.<br /><br />They taste great, somewhat sweet at first, then the wasabi flavor kicks in and it's this perfect balance.<br /><br />However the only complaint I have is that the wasabi flavoring is in a somewhat powder form, so if you are inhaling as you take a bit, the wasabi flavor will rush right down your windpipe punching and kicking as it goes down, possibly causing you to cough every once and a while. So you kinda have to be careful when popping this tasty little treats.<br /><br />I just loves these because they curve your appetite and give you that crispy, crunchy thing you want in a snack, all without them being horrible for ya.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great flavor.<br />Really fits the bill when you want something crunchy to munch on.<br />Low in calories, fat free, and VERY few ingredients.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Wasabi dust very hazardous to your health, use caution while eating these.

review/text: These are definitely wasabi, but they are pretty mild. Most wasabi-flavored foods give a harsh, burning sensation in my nose and mouth for a few moments; some are hot enough to water the eyes and force me to contemplate the sadist that first marketed them as a food product instead of as a medieval torture device.<br /><br />But not these. The spice in these only hit the tongue. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing depends on your own masochistic streak. Enjoy!

review/summary: Roland Hot Wasabi Rice Crackers
review/text: When my local international foods store stopped carrying this wonderful product, I searched on Amazon.com and found these favorites.  What I like to do is to go to ALDI Foods [...] and buy their avocados, slice them in half, remove the seed pit, and dip these delicious Roland Hot Wasabi Rice Crackers into the avocado shells.  They make great picnic treats, because no refrigeration is needed, they stay fresh when traveling, and they offer great nutrition and extraordinarily complementary flavors.  This combination is WAY, WAY better than a chip dip, and a lot more nutritious! The price and availability of this terrific Roland product can't be beat anywhere!  Thanks, Amazon!

Having said that, I really think it's time that Amazon INSIST on the ingredients label as well the nutritional label being displayed as MANDATORY on all foods that have such labels. Just my opinion. No returns on this item, so I'll just donate them to a food bank.

review/text: I love soft chewy candy and decided to buy some bulk on Amazon. I had never heard of Albanese but after reading some reviews I decided to give them a shot. Let me first say that 9 pounds of sour worms is a lot! These worms are very good. They are pretty big and the sour taste is not over powering. The fruit flavors are all tasty but there are only 3 different flavor combnations and after a half a bag I got kind of tired of the flavors and they weren't as enjoyable. If you don't eat them too fast like I did though they are very good. If I could do it again I would buy a 4.5 pound bag of this and 4.5 bag of something else for more of a variety. Would definately reccomend if you need bulk candy for a party or something like that.

review/text: What a great product for dogs. My mini doxie just loves these chew and to top it of, she loves the peanut butter favor. The day is  complete when she is given one. If she doen't eat it at once, she will hide it for later or carry it around with her. This flavor is the only one that she eats. I purchase the mini size because it is not too big for her and she can handle it for eating or carrying it around.

review/summary: These are a MUST!!!
review/text: My dogs LOVE these Smartbones!  So much so that they sometimes turn their noses at other treats I try to give them.  These bones are a great alternative to rawhide, and Amazon & Co. have some of the lowest prices on them.  I have seen them sold for as high as $15.99 in some local stores.  The only downside is that they do not last very long, as they are so easy to chew through.  My dogs (Lab mix and Boxer mix) power through the medium and large sized bones in just a few minutes.  Still, all in all, worth the money!

review/summary: Great Instant Coffee
review/text: Having grown up in England, I am well accustomed to instant coffee and I know how good it can taste. When I first moved to the US, I understood why no one drank instant coffee, it was all disgusting.<br /><br />Then I came across this variety of Nescafe and loved it. I find it to be better than most filtered coffee's. It has a strong and rich flavor and does not taste like you are drinking flavored water like many filtered coffee.<br /><br />A little more expensive, but you do get a lot of cups for the cost. The container is good and can be reused.

review/text: I love coffee. I've never been a fan of instant coffee (Naturally fresh brewed is better, right?) Since I've started drinking this in 2005 it has been my number one choice. I honestly prefer this to fresh brewed. We have a very nice coffee machine at work and I bring this in to drink instead. To me, it tastes just like, maybe better than, fresh brewed coffee.<br /><br />It also gives me that extra kick that I need in the morning. Enjoy.

review/text: I tried this coffee when my prior brand was being discontinued. Maybe I just have picked the wrong Tasters Choice coffee for me, but I am not impressed. This particular product tastes like liquefied burnings.<br /><br />The only reason why I gave an extra star is it was easy to make and you do get a lot of instant coffee for your money. However if it's ultimately difficult to drink down, the amount of product really isn't a benefit to the consumer.

review/summary: Nothing says "pure refreshment" like windshield washer blue soda!
review/text: Fall is in the air in Minnesota; the corn has turned golden brown, the leaves are beginning to change, and apple season is in full swing.  So naturally, I made yet another pilgrimage to JIM'S APPLE FARM (if you're going to be visiting southern MN between now and Thanksgiving, I highly recommend paying them a visit). As is par for the course during this time of year, the place was overrun with throngs of crazy apple lovers.  Apples are nice and all, however, the REAL treasures found at this place are all of the amazing variants of candy and, especially, the dozens of bizarre brands of soda that line the shelves!  Fighting my way past the "Honeycrisp Harolds" and the "apple butter Bettys," I finally found myself standing in front of the state's largest selection of off-the-wall sodas - truly a sublime thing to behold!  The last time that I visited this soda pop mecca, I left slighty disappointed because I wasn't financially prepared to delve in unfettered.  This time, however, I came prepared and bought a bevy of rainbow colored, carbonated ambrosia;  among my numerous selections was the wonderfully retro GOODY BLUE POP.  Electric blue in color, sweetened with pure cane sugar and "natural and artificial flavors," -- It's pretty much what you'd expect (complete with a noticable aftertaste either from the Blue # 1 dye, the cane sugar, or both).  I don't think that I'd purchase a whole 12 pack of this soda. However, for nostalgia's sake, it would be worth purchasing a couple of bottles.  Get at least a half dozen people willing to chip in, and THEN purchase a 12 pack of this stuff!

review/summary: Awesome seasoning
review/text: Ok, this is the only, and I mean ONLY seasoning I will EVER use for fish and shrimp for maximum taste results. I bought this at my local Kroger and was very amazed by the price. When I first used Andy's, I coated my fish with an egg wash (thinking the seasoned batter wouldn't stick) and I also put a bit of seasoning on the fish as well (thought  it may have needed some taste). Man, was I wrong, the batter was a bit heavy for me and the seasoning was way too much! The second time I used Andy's, I didn't use an egg wash or seasoning to my fish and I must say the fish came out perfectly. The batter was light,crispy, and it seasoned the fish perfectly. I will always use Andy's Fish seasoning.

review/summary: Salty Dog
review/text: Let me start by saying the first ingredient on the label is salt. We have tried both the ham and chicken flavor of LB Jamison's soup base and both rendered a very sodium laden broth. What's worse is that with the ham flavor you are generally adding it to other sodium laden ingredients so the soup comes out very salty. We ended up throwing the remaining product in the trash. I gave it two stars because I guess it kind of tastes like chicken if you can get past the salt.

review/summary: Currently, my favorite boullion
review/text: I really am picky about boullion, but also, I rely upon it. During the winter months, I drink it constantly to keep warm. Also, I find that when dehydrated, boullion restores me to normal. Also, I use it constantly for cooking (and yes, the MSG is really helpful in cooking -- MSG is a natural ingrediant that everyone responds to as being wonderfully delicious, so what's the problem with it?).  This boullion is absolutely delicous. All of my local grocery stores stopped carrying it. I don't know what to do about getting it now, and it's really dissappointing to not be able to obtain this locally.<br /><br />If you eat that salt-laden product "better than boullion", you are really missing something. That stuff is gross -- it's just salt! I don't like it at all.<br /><br />Recently, "knorr-swiss", which used to be my favorite, changed their formula. It doesn't even taste like chicken anymore. What a shame.<br /><br />I'm not sure what to do about boullion becuase I really do use it daily, yet, what can I do if the stores don't carry the good brands?  I really don't want to pay the amount that Amazon is asking.

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.
review/text: Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.  I highly recommend that you try them.

review/summary: Rude & Indifferent "service"
review/text: This was a Mother's day gift which arrived completely melted.  My Mom called them and told them of the condition. They told her that I should have requested "special packaging".  REALLY?!?!  For a CANDY company?!  They requested she either send the package back or send a picture via email.  Now, my mom is 75 years old, homebound and on oxygen due to severe lung disease.  She had her neighbor take a picture and email it to this company.  The company claimed they had received no such email picture but, as we all know, you get a notice back when your e-mail doesn't go to the intended recipient. BTW, this neighbor is a college professor and knows what she is doing.  I complained directly to the company but they told me my mom would have to send back the candy itself now.  Well, my 75 year old homebound, oxygen bound sick mom is not really able to do this and I think this company could not care less. I would do it but I live in Texas and she lives in Mississippi. I highly discourage anyone considering using this company considering their treatment of customers, especially an elderly lady.

Maybe their other items taste ok, but the Cashew Butter, was just gross tasting! I recently went to Aruba and at a grocery store there purchased a jar of cashew butter, and it was fantastic!! Soooo I thought hmmm, why not buy some more on line... WHAT A MISTAKE! I should have just burned the 20.00!! Stay away from the cashew butter from this seller!!! YUCK!! No, DOUBLE YUCK!!

review/text: The Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with the most expensive French butter. I actually prefer Lurpak over expensive brands like Beurre d'Echire, Celes-sur-Belle, or Isigny-Ste-Mere.<br /><br />Lurpak is a true lactic, or cultured, butter, and it is full of flavor. Therefore a warning is in order: once you start using this stuff there is no going back. Land O'Lakes simply will not do anymore and you will be stuck searching for this stuff wherever you go from then on.

review/summary: I like kellygold butter better
review/text: I guess with any cheese or dairy product, different people are going to have different tastes.  This butter is slightly closer to tasting like cheese (although it does not taste like cheese) than kellygold butter, imo.  Maybe that's why I like kellygold better.  Because I don't like the taste of cheese.<br />I'm sort of glad I got this butter to at least compare with kellygold though.  I think it is more easily spreadable, and maybe a tad bit "softer" butter than kellygold.<br />Maybe I'll just try ordinary organic american made butter next time.. it's a whole lot cheaper, and see how it compares with premium butters.
