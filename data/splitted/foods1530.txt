review/summary: Refreshing, fruity and amazing!
review/text: Out of the gold foil package, this matcha smells amazingly fruity. Super fruit amazing! The smell reminds me of really tarty berry yogurt. Brazilian Acai matcha appears slightly darker in powder form.<br /><br />I prepared this as a traditional hot cup. This matcha didn't froth up very well nor maintain froth, but I didn't really care. Interestingly, this matcha prepared has a different colour than normal, a dark forest green, probably from the acai berry powder. By the way, I used 1/4tsp plus 175f water.<br /><br />The taste of  Brazilian Acai matcha is quite fruity. A mix between a tropical flavor and blackberries or blueberries. There is also a natural sweetness to this matcha - adding any additional sweetener would be overkill I think. With the fruityness and natural sweetness, this hot cup is very refreshing! There is no tart or bitterness to this matcha! I honestly was expected this to taste tart or puckery.<br /><br />In the end, this was surprisingly good! Is this matcha totally cheating with getting a double whammy of healthy energizing matcha and acai? Don't pass up this matcha - I'm thinking this is up there on being one of my fav flavors from Red Leaf Teas!

review/summary: A-sci-eeeeeeeeeeeee!
review/text: Okay, so, fair warning. I'm not overly familiar with the acai berry or how it should taste. I've had acai berry/blueberry juice before, and loved it, so I'm hoping I'll love the berry on its own. Of course now, all I can think of when it comes to this tea is RuPaul's Drag Race with all the different queens trying to say "acai" for a TV commercial. It's like the Pink Dragonfruit from Tealish. I've never had dragonfruit, but it smelled amazing and so I tried it and I loved it. Now I'm on the hunt for an actual dragonfruit to try. So while I can tell if I like the tea and if it tastes good or not, I have no real way to tell if it tastes like the actual fruit at all. But that's okay! Everyone should be open to new experiences, and I am looking forward to this one.<br /><br />Okay, yum! It's kind of like blueberry on steroids? I don't know, it's got this amazing berry flavor with a round tartness....yes, round. It was the word that came to mind as I sipped it. It's just...lovely and unexpected. The flavor is very bold and very...unique. I don't quite know how to describe it, but I liked it. I definitely want to try more acai flavored things if this is what I have to look forward to! I'm not sure if I need to restock on this ASAP, but it's definitely in the running for my must-have list.

review/text: My sister bought me the small one, of 30g. I was looking for a natural product to help me with some slightly increased blood sugar level. I was drinking it for a period of one month (one cup per day, skipped few times so you can say that 30g is good for about 30 cups) and my blood results were indeed better. Was it this tea or my general sugar issue awareness - I can't tell, but this was one of the best teas I have ever tasted.

review/summary: Best budget meal for one or two
review/text: Tasty Bite Punjab Eggplant is delicious and spicy.  Try adding a bit of plain yogurt.  Serve with rice or bread (nan or pita work well) and you have a brilliant meal that costs only a few dollars.  This is true of all of the Tasty Bite Indian Entrees.  I wish the Tasty Bite Thai Meals came as Entrees (i.e. without the rice or noodles) so I could streach them out into a big meal by adding my own rice or noodles.<br /><br />Tasty Bite Entrees are really easy to keep on hand, since they don't have to be refrigerated.  Buying in bulk works well for these.

review/text: What can I say, I just love this product.  Ideally for ME I would like it to be a little bit more tomato-ey and a tad less spicy, but when I taste it I remind myself that it is truly more authentic in its current state and I can taste the eggplant more despite the spiciness as I've gotten used to it.  Sometimes I just eat it as is without heating it up, which also lessens the spiciness level.  But it is SO good, I just ordered one of the vegetables packets and I doubt it can be as great as this one but it's worth a try.  It has a comforting smooshy testure to it, with bits of well-cooked onions intertwined in it.

review/summary: The best Tasty Bite meal.
review/text: This is the best of the Tasty Bite Indian retort-packaged dishes.  It is moderately spicy and has a wonderful flavor of eggplant.  It is a bit oily, like some Indian foods can be at times.  The texture is sort of creamy/lumpy because of the eggplant seeds.<br /><br />It is wonderful with a little microwaved frozen broccoli added to bulk up the meal, along with brown rice and some frozen naan.  Yum!<br /><br />This same item is sold camouflaged at Trader Joe's.

review/summary: Tasty AND convenient bites!
review/text: I've enjoyed trying various food items from Amazon lately, and this is hands down my favorite. The little pouches are sooo convienent; the product stays fresh and tastey until you want to use it, and it is just the right size to prepare a dish for two, or clips it shut (I use a clothes pin, or a paper clip) to eat later.<br /><br />The Punjab Eggplant is a bit spicey, especially if you are eating it by itself. I use it as a side dish, rather than an entree, or I pour it over brown rice or the like.  For example, when I got my first shipment of foods from Amazon, we were in a hurry to get out, and we didn't have time to make a meal.  Looking through my stuff, I pulled out the Punjab egglant, a jar of whole wheat couscous, and a tin of sardines.  I heated up the egglant during the five minutes it takes to prepare couscous, put the cousous on two plates, added a couple of sardines for protein, and viola, a super quick tastey and nutricious meal!

review/text: Tasty Bite makes a "Jaipur Vegetables" that is soooo delicious.  It is the best of all the others ie: eggplant, lentil, spinach.  OK it is a tad high in salt but the seasoning is just perfect.  I am trying to get away from rice (need to diet) so I crumple up a slice of dried Ezekiel Bread in a bowl and pour the pouch over it.  it sops up the sauce and makes it more robust.  Sometimes I add some freshly cooked vegetables.  No preservatives at all and a cinch to prepare in boilable silver foil pouch which is also easy to open.  I rate this selection 4 star...no 5!

review/text: I bought this specifically because it didn't come with rice.  Rice is one of the most inexpesive food items on the planet and it's so easy to make.  The reviewer who said it didn't taste like eggplant has obviously never eaten Indian food before.  This is a non-refridgerated item that is priced right and tastes pretty good.  I prefer it over other Tasty Bite entrees.

review/summary: Very good flavor. Serve over rice.
review/text: I'm a big fan of Tasty Bite and I've tried a lot of their offerings. This one is very good.. especially over rice. My disclaimer is that they were all tried over rice.  My absolute favorite is the Madras Lentils. (With or without rice) Than the Channa Masala and Punjab Eggplant. Beans Masala & Basmati Rice Ready Meal is also very good. The ones that I didn't like sooo much were the Jaipur Vegetables, Vegetable Korma, and Kashmir Spinach.  I really wanted to like the Bombay Potatoes but even over a generous helping of rice it's just too spicy, It has a good flavor but there's just too much heat in the mix. As a little side note, it looks like Tasty Bite is in the process of changing their packaging from envelopes in boxes to just envelopes. Good for the environment but WOW! the edges will cut you up. I'm still nursing a good size cut  from simply turning the package over to read ingredients. Hopefully they work on the design a bit more.

review/summary: Would have liked the eggplant to have more texture
review/text: I love eggplant and I know it's not difficult to see from the picture that it's mostly pureed, but I had hoped it would have a little more texture.  Overall, this one was just 'ok' for me.  A few cubed pieces or hardy chunks of eggplant would have made all the difference.  I also found the flavor to be a little more mild then what I prefer and in comparison to some of the other Tasty Bite entries.  I could see myself repurchasing this item, but mostly just to maintain a decent variety in my otherwise lacking 'lunch' habit.  It's just not my favorite Tasty Bite.

For context: I prefer the "mild" salsa and find "hot" way too much. Judge your own preference. It has 510 mg/sodium per serving and one bag is two servings. Something to keep in mind. Cut back on salt the rest of the day if you plan to eat a package of this for lunch or dinner. The brand's spinach paneer dish is better.

review/text: As the title says  what could be better I mean if its good enough for our astronauts then I'd think it was good enough for me.<br />think about it, how is it made ? did they take some cows and shoot them in to space?? Hey they did it with pigs and monkeys why not cows ?<br />I know that's utterly ridiculousness.<br />As for the taste its good, you can tell that it was once a real piece of ice cream that they dehydrated. This is the same stuff that your likely to find at air and space museums. There was only one issue I had with it,  During shipping or packaging the ice cream got pretty crunched up. lots of little pieces rather tan a solid chunk.  This is purely cosmetic and doesn't effect the taste at all. A tad bit on the pricey side but its one of those num nums that you should treat your self to every blue moon. This one was for my wife but I plan on purchasing a couple for both of us, there great to throw in your lunch and there relay not all that bad fat/cal wise compared to say chunky monkey by B&J. Enjoy it it was made just for you by  space cows.

review/text: I don't consider myself a coffee snob and I can't afford to drink Starbucks everyday. For the everyday fix, I know where to get my cheap diner coffee or I make my own at home. I was hoping this instant coffee would be a great way to get a quick cup in when all I had access to was the hot water from the water cooler at work. I ended up dumping the entire first cup. I mixed together the recommended water and powder and was hopeful when I smelled the pepperminty aroma. But the first sip was nothing more than hot water. So I added a little more.  Then a little more.  The water got sweeter (but grainer) and the scent got stronger but coffee did not. When I dumped the contents of my mug, the bottom was covered with the lumpy "latte" mix. If all you need is the smell of coffee and peppermint to perk you up, this will do. But if what you want is an actual cup of coffee, don't bother.

review/summary: just okay
review/text: The Peppermint Mocha latte from Maxwell House is okay, but it's not the greatest. I used the 4 teaspoons that the package reccommended and to me it tasted like hot sugar water. I added a few more teaspoons with no result in change of flavor. The peppermint flavoring starts out strong, but by the end you can barely taste it. I think the flavoring is strongest in the foam that forms at the top of the drink after the hot water or milk is poured. The mocha flavor is basically non-existant. I could not detect any mocha or chocolate flavor throughout the drink. A hint of coffee flavor is present but the whole drink was pretty bland to be honest. My brother tried the drink as well. He took a few sips then poured the rest of his mug down the sink drain. It just wasn't that great.<br /><br />It's a quick go to drink for those cold winter nights but I rather stick to my regular coffee or hot chocolate.

review/summary: Very nice for a quick coffee drink without visiting a coffee shop.
review/text: If you are used to getting your coffee in a coffee shop, this may not be the product for you.  But for someone like me who lives at least 30 minutes away from the nearest little drive-thru coffee place, and 45 minutes from the nearest Starbucks...<br /><br />...well, a product like this is a nice change of pace.  In a few minutes (long enough to heat up some water), I can cuddle up with a book and a peppermint-smelling cup of coffee, and I don't have to get dressed or drive anywhere.<br /><br />I thought the peppermint taste was about perfect... definitely there, but not overpowering.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this.<br /><br />I also threw a couple tablespoons of the mix into a chocolate cake I made for my son's birthday... that left a very subtle peppermint flavor that he thought was pretty fun.<br /><br />Very nice for a quick coffee drink without visiting a coffee shop.

review/summary: A delightful flavor to warm you to your toes
review/text: This "Peppermint Mocha Latte" has a delicate flavor.  I expected it to taste like Maxwell House's "Suisse Mocha" would taste with a candy cane stirred in but I was incorrect.  It does not have the heavier chocolate flavor of "Suisse Mocha".  This beverage exudes the delightful aroma of peppermint, but the peppermint is almost an illusion as I could not taste it while in my mouth, but it lingered on my tongue after swallowing.  A really nice balance of light flavors that I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />Grab yourself a cup, throw on your snuggie and settle down to a good book this winter.<br /><br />Here are the stats:<br /><br />Serving Size =  1 1/3 Tablespoon<br />Calories = 50<br />Fat Calories = 15<br />Total Carbs = 9 grams<br />Sugars = 7 grams<br />Sodium = 40 mg<br /><br />Contains milk

review/summary: Holiday Latte
review/text: Maxwell House International Coffee Peppermint Mocha Latte comes just in time for the first frosty mornings of November. I tried the latte mix two ways: once with water and again with milk. I used four teaspoons of mix to six ounces of water for my first cup. The flavors were weak and the drink thin. I added one more teaspoon of mix to get a more satisfying flavor. When I tested the latte mix with milk, I used five teaspoons of mix in eight ounces of milk. This gave a drink with a nice consistency and a good flavor.<br /><br />If you prefer a stronger peppermint flavor, then make the latte with water. If you prefer the mocha flaver to predominate, then use milk. Using whole milk brings out the deep chocolatey end of the complex flavors.<br /><br />Regardless of the liquid used to make the latte, the foam on top developed quickly and lasted until the last sip. The latte is a satisfying treat for coffee lovers who want a more festive beverage to drink during this time of year.

review/summary: Decent enough...
review/text: If you're looking for an instant coffee/latte beverage that'll knock your socks off, this probably isn't the one that will do it. It's good, but not great.<br /><br />The drink is made easily enough, which is what it has going for it most of all. I like that I'm able to measure out my own amount of powder, something that I can't do with so many of the individually packed brands out there. It's not as travel-friendly, but it does have a convenience factor to it.<br /><br />What kind of gets me is the drink's taste. The peppermint flavor is very strong (which I love) but the rest of it is a little on the weak side as far as taste goes. This tastes good enough for me to want to drink a second cup but I can't help but feel that with all of the various instant flavors out there and all of the coffee additions you can buy nowadays (in specific flavored creamers) this just doesn't stand out as much as I wanted it to.<br /><br />It's not a "meh" drink but it is mediocre. I can't help but feel that if the mocha flavor was just a teensy bit stronger the drink would have been a lot better.

review/summary: Very rich and flavorful.
review/text: Wonderful foam, tasty blend of mocha and peppermint make this a hit.  Everyone I've served it to has been appreciative.  This is certainly a wonderful treat to keep on hand for the holidays.  It mixes well, without having to "chase down" those little lumps of mix that so many dry mix drinks leave behind in a cup of hot water even after stirring for an eternity. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because it takes so much to make a standard mug of coffee. The box says 17 servings per container --- in a child size teacup perhaps! If you haven't tried International Coffee for a while this is a good one to start with.  I find this one easier, tastier, and quicker (not to mention cheaper) than going through the drive-thru at my favorite coffee stand.

review/summary: I love this stuff!
review/text: I bought a few containers of this brand a few months ago because they were on clearance (apparently because Maxwell House changed the look of the product) and I loved them. I hadn't tried the peppermint mocha though, and I love this too. I like the plastic container better than the metal one they had before and the design is more appealing.<br /><br />I am not a morning straight up coffee person. I like my caffeine kick as much as the next person, but I prefer it to be in the form of a mocha or some other equally expensive coffee based drink. This product does the job for me. It does not have much of a coffee taste at all, so if that's what you're looking for, you might not enjoy this. Also, as with most mixes and mochas, this is full of sugar (in fact, it's the first ingredient). According to the nutrition facts, this product has 50 calories, 1.5g of fat, 40mg of sodium, 9g of carbs, 7g of sugar and 0g of protein per serving. A serving is 4tsp (1.3tbsp) of mix to 6-8oz of water.<br /><br />Somehow, this mix foams up when mixed in, which makes it seem more like a mocha/latte than the usual mix. I like the taste a lot, I just wish it wasn't so expensive.

review/text: I am huge fan of peppermint mocha and was really excited to try this product. After taking a few sips, I was left wanting for more. I thought both the chocolaty taste of a mocha and the peppermint were both lacking in intensity. I prefer having the Trader Joe's peppermint hot chocolate with some coffee or the well crafted peppermint mocha at Starbukcs instead. This just doesn't give the power packed taste that a peppermint mocha should.

Adding it to boiling water as told in the instructions I would just give it two stars.  When I added it to a cup of coffee with cream it was a little better.  The scent is pretty good and actually smells like mint and chocolate.  The aftertaste tastes like it's supposed to be mint, but not quite.  One look at the ingredients doesn't exactly make your mouth water.  I'll use up the rest of it, but it'll never show up on my shopping list.

So it's not wonderful, in regards to taste or natural ingredients. However, it is convenient. There are times when convenience trumps quality. When you just want something you can stir into hot water for a quick treat, this is great. Peppermint mocha is my husband's favorite flavor. I like to have this on hand for when we don't want to go out for "frou-frou" coffee or take time to make it from scratch.

In order to get any latte' flavor at all you have to use two or three times the recommended amount.<br /><br />It seems with as many latte' brands out there Maxwell House would have come out with something a little better tasting.

review/text: The Peppermint Mocha Latte is mediocre when it comes to coffee flavor.  It takes more like a cocoa mix because it lacks a certain edge I expect from coffee, even if it is a latte.  I put 4 heaping teaspoons in an 8 oz. mug and it's still bland.  It's not a diet product so I expected a richness but it's pretty flat.  The fat, calorie, and sugar content is not bad, at least. For 1 1/3 tbs. you get 70 calories, 2% fat, and 7 g. sugar.  It's a nice thing to have on hand for the holidays but if you are looking for flavor, you are probably better off brewing your own coffee and dropping a Starlight mint in your cup and a squeeze from the good old Hershey syrup bottle.

review/text: I had just left a review for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZT25P6">Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte, 9-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a> saying that I wasn't a fan, but for Peppermint Mocha - 5 Stars all the way.  I am a big fan of the Christmas / holiday seasonal flavors (Gingerbread, Peppermint Mocha, etc.) and couldn't pass up trying this.  I can say that even though this is not as good as Starbucks, I was still satisfied with the balance of flavor and low cost.  The peppermint is a little strong, but not enough to over power the chocolate.  The balance is so good, that the more you use the richer the taste - the peppermint never got overwhelming for me.  I couldn't recommend the the pumpkin spice, but I will recommend this.  If you are a huge fan of this holiday flavor, but get tired of paying 5 dollars a cup from chain stores, then give this a try.  Not quite as good, but definitely very worthy at this price.  And when those high dollar bistros discontinue the peppermint mocha, then you can still have a stock pile sitting in the pantry.  I will definitely be buying more while it's still available!

I put 1 heaping TBS of Peppermint Mocha in a coffee cup and brewed 2 shots of espresso right into it, then added warm milk and topped it with whipped cream. The flavor came through in just the right amount.. only downside is the additional 150 calories so this will be a seasonal treat only.

review/summary: Peppermint Mocha!
review/text: A fine instant coffee of just the type that should please almost anyone -- who, note carefully, knows what they're getting into.<br /><br />If you wouldn't enjoy this type of instant mix from a can, then this won't be for you.<br /><br />But honestly, it's delicious.  It has just the mild, sweet sort of flavor I'd imagine pleasing almost anyone.  It's exactly the type of mild, comforting beverage I could see one person or a few people enjoying while a family or a group hung out together for the holidays.  It would be just the sort of pleasant taste to have in a cup at your side.<br /><br />The mocha's not strong, the peppermint's not strong, but both are pronounced and noticeable flavors.  I mix mine with heated milk; it's the perfect "creamy" complement to the coffee mix itself.  One time I added some honey; it didn't over-sweeten it, although some might think so.  You could add spices: cloves, cinnamon, just about anything.  Or drink it on its own.<br /><br />The only "full disclosure" I'd make in committing myself to this review is that I've always loved these types of instant mixes out of a can.  You're reading someone, right now, who enjoys instant mashed potatoes and whatnot; artificial flavorings don't bother me.  And in the instant case, I fully appreciate that the coffee powder has been mixed to perfection; that you can drink it mixed into either water or milk; that the taste isn't too strong.  The flavors are quite smooth.<br /><br />So what can I say?, but ... recommended!

review/summary: Not as strong as I would like, but great as an addition to coffee.
review/text: As some others have commented, if you make coffee with this product using the amount advised (4 tsps. per 6-8 ounce cup) it makes a very weak coffee.  I think I would sooner mix that amount of the mix in a cup of freshly made coffee.  Adding more of the mix would make this a very expensive route to one's morning cuppa!<br /><br />I mixed this coffee up for 4 friends (two teenage boys, 1 teenage girl and 1 mom, like myself) and me.  We started with the prescribed 4 teaspoons.  Everyone tasted and said, "Too weak."  The boys took theirs and did not add any more mix (ran off downstairs), the girl added quite a bit (although I lost track of exactly how much).  The mom/friend did not add any more mix, but then she said that mint wasn't her favorite flavoring, so it didn't appeal to her anyway.  I added more mix, although maybe not quite as much as the teenage girl.  Amongst the 5 of us drinking coffee, we used about half of the container (which, using the 4 teaspoon amount, makes 17 cups).  So, obviously, if you use more than the 4 teaspoons suggested on the package, one of these packages would make probably 10 or so servings at the most.<br /><br />Although, this doesn't sound very practical, this IS a convenience food.  It is easier than using a coffee maker when you are on the sledding slope!<br /><br />I liked someone's suggestion of using this as a Christmas gift with a mug (and spoon?).  And although I have not tried this, using it to flavor baked goods, like mint brownies or cookies also sounds like an interesting thing to try.

The coffee flavor is not present and the peppermint is very weak in taste. I used the exact amount of water and scoops of coffee, and it is very weak. I had to add extra coffee for flavor and still not great. For those who like a weak coffee drink and a hint of flavor they may enjoy this, but I felt it was average at best. I will admit I like overly strong coffee usually, so it may just be my own taste that is interfering in liking this coffee. I would have enjoyed it more if it had more of a peppermint taste as well.

review/text: I love mint-anything -- and I definitely love mint and chocolate together. So I was really looking forward to trying this one, having also enjoyed various varieties of similar coffee mixes over the years.<br /><br />The powder even smells like mint! As you pour in the water, the consistency and appearance is more like hot chocolate than latte, and the level of foam is definitely more akin to hot cocoa. As far as the taste, the mint flavor comes through nice and strongly -- yes!!! Love that. (By contrast, recently I purchased a peppermint holiday liquid creamer for coffee, and the mint taste is so subtle I feel I have to add half the bottle -- not a good thing.) And actually, because the chocolate taste here is fairly robust, this drink really does remind me more of mint-laced hot cocoa. Not a bad thing for me, but if you're expecting more of a latte feel here, as advertised ...<br /><br />At any rate, because it's mint and because it's chocolate and because it's tasty, I give it a high mark.

review/text: I've always liked International coffee products but tend to use a lot of the product to make the taste of the drink stronger.<br /><br />I used this in my regular coffee in place of sweetener. I got instant flavor and it was delicious.<br /><br />I also tried the Peppermint Mocha in my morning chocolate nutrition shakes. It gave it an extra kick.<br /><br />When I used it with water, I had to triple the amount I used.  I think it would be best with warm almond milk...that way it would taste more like a latte.<br /><br />This is a great occasional treat. This flavor is especially good right now that the weather is transitioning from fall to winter.<br /><br />Also, the new containers are no longer metal. Which is nice. That was always nasty when I would put up a tin and bring it back down later to use and find the metal was icky,<br /><br />I would buy this on occasion.  I'm not a big fan of everything on the nutritional label but in moderation and on occasion, it would be fine.

review/summary: coffee, hot chocolate or flavored water?
review/text: I'm not sure exactly what this drink is supposed to be so I probably wouldn't tell my friends about it. It is made by Maxwell House and says that it is a cafe style beverage mix. What kind of drink, i'm not sure.<br /><br />When made like the instructions say...4 teaspoons per cup of water, the drink is little more than colored water with a whiff of peppermint. I did a bit of experimenting and added twice that much into a cup of water. Still not enough flavor for me but it was hot and got me a little warmer.<br /><br />Another thing that is interesting about this drink mix is that it does have coffee in it. About 16 down on the ingredients list so I'm thinking they just passed a bean over this container. I went a bit further and added some already made coffee and a little more powder to my concoction and it was quite good.<br /><br />This drink smacks of chocolate drink mix.  Looks almost exactly like nestle quik only a little finer.  Being 7.1 ounces, it doesn't take long for this powder to be gone.<br /><br />The nutrition facts are a little strange in that the serving size is 1 1/3 tablespoons per 8 ounce cup which is what they consider a serving. With that, there are 17 serving in this little box and 50 calories, 1.5 grams of fat, 40 mg. of sodium , 7 sugars and 9 carbs. The first three ingredients are some sort of sugars.<br /><br />Would I get this again?  No! It is good but only the way I make it.

review/text: This really does smell like the Starbucks Peppermint Mocha, although the mocha flavor is not quite as strong here.  I tried it both with water, and with milk, and liked it both ways, but found that the chocolate taste was stronger for some reason when made with milk.  The peppermint flavor is overall stronger than the chocolate flavor, so that might be an issue for those who prefer their mocha with just a hint of mint.  I loved the flavor of it and found it leaves you with a refreshing aftertaste, sort of like you've just eaten a peppermint patty or a Thin Mint cookie.  It makes a nice foam on top so it feels like an authentic coffeehouse drink-- it foams even more (and tastes a lot richer) when made with milk.  A perfect treat for chilly winter days.

It has a very strong peppermint flavor with very little mocha or coffee flavor at all.  If you are a fan of peppermint this product will be right up your alley.  For my taste I more than likely will use the remaining product as an added flavor boost to my regular coffee when I am in the mood for peppermint.  Or I suppose you could add coffee to a cup of the Maxwell House International Peppermint Mocha, it would also be nice to add a spoonful to a cup of hot chocolate.  As a stand along coffee drink I do not like it.

I felt like I was experiencing a little bit of aromatherapy! It's almost a slight menthol sort of fresh, clean, peppermint scent and flavor.<br /><br />While regular hot chocolate is cozy and warm, this has a bit more caffeine from the coffee and with the energizing peppermint added to it, it makes for a really nice afternoon pick-me-up.<br /><br />And compared to getting coffee out at big name coffee shops (as much as I enjoy that coffee too), this is very economical.

review/summary: Very good mint flavor!
review/text: This Peppermint Mocha is so delicious!  Mint mixed with chocolate is one of my top favorite combinations.  I agree with other reviewers that this doesn't really taste like coffee - in fact, it doesn't have any coffee flavor that I can tell at all.  I don't mind, because it tastes like minty hot cocoa!  It can be hard to find really good mint flavor in cocoas, and this one is just right!<br /><br />I only was able to make 10 cups from one canister, while the product information says there are 17 servings per canister.  I used 3 spoonfuls instead of the recommended 4, the flavor was strong and I still had some mix leftover in the bottom of my cup.  It always bothers me when directions say "Measure 4 teaspoons into a cup..." as I am never totally sure if they mean a literal measuring teaspoon (who has one of those hanging around their office breakroom, anyway?) or a regular eating spoon (which my mother always called "a teaspoon").  I think this accounts for the discrepency of servings per can that I experienced.<br /><br />Overall, I would love to have this to drink all year round for a special treat!

review/summary: not too sweet and just the right mint....
review/text: I love these coffees for camping, or in the winter time.  I've tried most of the flavors and chose this one because the hubby is a pepermint/chocolate fan.  A couple things I noticed with this coffee, it is a bit foamy on the top, which I like and the taste is not as sweet as some of the other flavors.  I liked the fact you didn't get a slam of sweet, it was just perfectly sweetened with a nice taste of peppermint without being over-powering.  This would be lovely at breakfast or on a cool evening, souped up with a little extra libation for an adult kick.  I would purchase this item and would recommend it for a chilly evening....delicious!~

review/summary: Light on the latte but still an enjoyable treat
review/text: I rarely buy lattes at any of the major coffee chains but frequently turn to instant mixes for an occasional change of pace. I've tried a variety of brands and flavors. However, this is my first experience with Maxwell House. Overall it was a very good one.<br /><br />I am a fan of peppermint and chocolate, seperately and or combined. That is why, despite the fact that this mix doesn't really have a strong coffee taste, I'm giving it a five star rating. I found it to be light on latte taste but, nevertheless, it was an enjoyable treat.<br /><br />The label recommends 4 teaspoons for a six to eight ounce cup. All of the instant products that I've used tend to be a little watery without adding more mix. When I made my first cup with 4 heaping teaspoons and it tasted better than I'd expected. Some might prefer 5 teaspoons. You have the option to adjust it according to preference. I've stuck with the 4 heaping teaspoons and enjoyed a cup every evening since it arrived.<br /><br />With 7 grams of sugar and 50 calories, per serving, Maxwell House Peppermint Mocha latte is one of our new favorite evening beverages.

review/summary: A little too sweet
review/text: The powder does taste very very good when mixed with milk. I really like the combination of peppermint and mocha. It tastes much better than Starbuck. However, it is a little too sweet for me. Maybe because I don't consume much sugar in my daily diet, so I'm not a fan of sweet food. But I think if you drink coffee regularly, you won't find any issue with the taste. Last thought, Starbuck and Mc Donald already made a lot of money, so spend yours on something more affordable (this maxwell coffee) plus, you don't even have to drive to get your coffee.

review/summary: Very pleasant but takes some experimentation to find your preferred strength.
review/text: When I first prepared a mug of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZT61E2">Maxwell House International Coffee Peppermint Mocha Latte</a>, I guessed at what would be the right amount of product to mix with the water. I got a strong peppermint taste with overtones of chocolate and almost no coffee flavor, and the hot water at the heart of it was very obvious. I had clearly used an inadequate amount of the product.<br /><br />I didn't want to swing too far the other way with the next mug, so I boosted it by a teaspoon, and ended up with much better results. I'll probably try one teaspoon more, but I'm worried the peppermint will overwhelm the flavor at that point. We'll see.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of the package or the serving technique: it comes in a plastic container with a plastic/foil seal on top that is virtually impossible to tear without removing it, so you don't have the option to partially open the container--making it easier not to spill and to control your portions--unless you use a knife or scissors to cut the foil. I would probably mind that less if not for the 3"x2" opening at the top of the cotnainer that makes it very easy to spill. In fact, in peeling off the foil, the container "breathed" a cloud of product into the air and onto the tabletop.<br /><br />In the long run, this is a pretty decent product, but it doesn't hold a candle to the better instant hot cocoas and doesn't really have enough coffee flavor to compete with a true Mocha Latte from a local shop. Of course, it also doesn't come with the coffee shop's price tag...

review/summary: kinda bland, was hoping for more flavor
review/text: I made the peppermint mocha latte as directed but found it to be a bit bland, so I added another 1/2 tsp of the powder. I then added a packet of Splenda and it definitely tasted better, but the peppermint and mocha flavors are both really muted. My teenager agreed and added a mini candy cane to his to boost the peppermint flavor! I am surprised by the reviews where people say the peppermint flavor is too strong...I could hardly taste it. Peppermint + chocolate is one of my all-time flavor combinations, so I'm disappointed that this didn't do it justice.

review/text: This product tastes good. It has a very nice balance between the flavors but it does taste more of mocha than coffee for sure.

review/summary: Relaxing, tasty, and definately for Christmas
review/text: I like the fact that although there is the suggested amount for 6 to 8 oz of water, you can add as much as you want. It can be as weak or strong as you want. I like it a bit stronger, so I added an extra teaspoon or two and added it warm milk instead of water and it worked well. The flavor of peppermint is not very strong. I think it is just right, not over powering. It definitely ideal for the Christmas, especially since I live in Upstate New York and at Christmas, we will most likely have snow on the ground and it will be cold. It will be nice to have something nice to drink, since I am not a big coffee drinker, I am the type of person that likes something a bit more fancy.

The drink had just the right amount of both, and the smell was warm and inviting. I would definately buy this.<br />P.S. I added some evaporated milk to mine. This makes it taste richer without interfering with the taste of the coffee.

This one tastes like peppermint with a hint of chocolate (and plenty of caffeine). Good value for the price...but slightly deceptive nutrition info:<br /><br />50 calories a serving sounds great! But a serving is 1 1/3 tsp. And to make a serving according to the directions, it takes 4 tsp...so in reality an actual serving is 150 calories...but with treats who is counting.<br /><br />I will come clean and say that I usually use this as creamer in my regular coffee...extra caffeine bang and a fainter peppermint flavour.

review/summary: Liquid Peppermint Patty
review/text: I LOVE flavored coffee! The one thing I love more than flavored coffee is seasonally flavored coffee. When I saw that Maxwell House was coming out with a peppermint mocha for this winter, I knew that I had to try it. I usually don't like instant coffee and for that reason I don't typically buy Maxwell House. However, if this is anything like their other products...Maxwell House, you have a new convert! The flavor is fantastic, it is easier to make than hot chocolate, and it perks me up in the morning.<br /><br />The only issue that I think some drinkers may have with this product is that the peppermint is very pronounced. I absolutely love mint so this was just another plus for me. However, if you're looking for a more mocha flavor with a hint of mint...this may not be your cup of coffee. Being that it comes in packs of four, you may want to taste someone else's before you commit. But for me, this is four stars!

review/text: I have several favorite flavors of Maxwell House International Coffee.  One is Suisse Mocha so when I saw Peppermint Mocha I had to give it a try.  With the first swallow I got the familiar mocha taste followed by a strong peppermint aftertaste.  Since I like both mocha and peppermint I liked the combination and the balance of the two flavors.  If I had to choose between Suisse Mocha and Peppermint Mocha I would choose the Peppermint.  If you are a fan of Maxwell House International Coffee give this one a try.  If you have never tried any of the flavors this would be a good one to start on.

review/text: First of all, I believe taste in coffee is very individual, just like taste in chocolate.  Some prefer milk, some prefer dark.  When it comes to coffee, I prefer a good French roast.  I didn't have high hopes for a flavored instant coffee drink, and the best I can say about Maxwell House International Latte in Peppermint Mocha flavor is that it's drinkable.  In my opinion, it is too light on coffee flavor and much too heavy on the peppermint.  It's actually more like a hot chocolate drink than a latte.  There's a decent amount of foam after mixing in the hot water.  I added a bit of milk but did not need sugar as this was plenty sweet for me.  I'll keep it around to offer guests who might like this sort of thing, but it doesn't at all compare to a real latte.

The first day I thought I didn't get enough mix in the water (when I got to work it was like drinking peppermint water.) But the 2nd day, with even more mix in the water, I realized that it is the flavor of this particular mix. While the 2nd day's attempt was much better, I still say it needs more coffee flavor to it. Still, for a quick hot drink on the go, this is not bad at all. I would buy it again.

review/text: COST: At the time of this writing this runs about $0.44 per 8oz cup. Not bad for a flavored, hot drink especially when paying nearly $2 for a plain, no flavored black house coffee at Starbucks<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Sugar; Nondairy Creamer (one of the worst things to put in your body), Maltodextrin, Cocoa, Instant Coffee, Artificial Flavor, Sodium Citrate, Modified Cornstarch, Silicon Dioxide<br /><br />ALLERGY WARNING: Contains Milk<br /><br />PREPARATION: Add 4 teaspoons to 6oz-8oz boiling water or hot milk<br /><br />TASTE: Uh, no. It doesn't taste like a latte to me. Rather tastes like a peppermint flavored hot chocolate.<br /><br />The peppermint is nice and strong. Strangely there is ZERO peppermint listed in the ingredients!!<br /><br />Even when I tried it with half serving (2 tsp), the peppermint stood out but the mocha/cocoa was very light.<br /><br />I mixed a full serving with a cup of black coffee and I felt like peppermint, cocoa and coffee all stood out better. When using a full serving with water, there is zero coffee taste to me.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />If you want a peppermint hot chocolate with a small amount of caffeine, then this is your product.<br />If you want more of a mocha latte, then this will fall short.

review/text: I was surprised at at the taste of this instant peppermint mocha latte. I am a huge fan of Starbucks peppermint mocha and this instant mix does a decent job of creating it for me at home. It's definitely not the same as the coffee house version, but the peppermint isn't too overpowering and (always important to me) it dissolves well and doesn't leave clumps of the mix in the bottom of the cup. The only thing that I don't care for as much is a very, very slight aftertaste - which could just be the peppermint flavoring. If you need a peppermint mocha fix and are looking for a way to stretch your coffee dollars, this makes a pretty good substitute.

review/summary: Delicious Dessert Coffee
review/text: If you haven't tried any of the line of International Coffee flavors, the peppermint mocha is a great one to try. It's a delicious mint chocolate coffee that is great after dinner. The peppermint mocha is not too sweet or too minty, it was a nice sophisticated hot chocolatey coffee.<br /><br />The coffee is super easy to make: just add hot water. The directions also say you can add hot milk. I'll give you one of my favorite twists: add a scoop of peppermint mocha mix to your morning cup of Joe for a little treat. I keep several flavors on hand to flavor my coffee depending on my mood.<br /><br />I find a little less is more with these coffees. They can be a little too sweet if you use too much powder. But a few trials and I am sure you can find the flavor level that is best for you. Also the mix does contain powdered milk just in case dairy is an issue.<br /><br />I can easily recommend the peppermint mocha to anyone who likes mint, chocolate, or coffee.

review/text: I'm not much for flavored coffees but wanted to give this a shot.  I actually had to go higher than the recommended 4 teaspoons to 8 ounces of water because the flavor was just simply too weak.  Adding another couple teaspoons had it in the wheelhouse of the typically stronger coffee I like to drink.  The flavor is pleasant and not overly sweet, and the peppermint flavor is obvious but not as strong as I expected- a good thing, in my view.  Overall, it's a fine drink, but because I am a black coffee drinker, it's not for me.  Recommended for those who like sugar or creamer in their coffee, and who are looking for something Christmasy to drink for the holiday/winter season.

review/summary: Yummy winter warmer; packaging remarks
review/text: this from my wife:<br /><br />"I enjoy my coffee and my hot chocolate.  Put those together and add a peppermint stick, and that's about what you get with this latte.  It's delicious.  However, I regard the value of this product as a mere packaging convenience.  It's something you could put together yourself at home, but would you?  File this under 'indulgence'.<br /><br />Speaking of packaging, I appreciate that the plastic packaging is recyclable but would've preferred tin.  To their credit, Maxwell House have marked the package as top-rack dishwasher safe and the size and shape of the package mean that I might actually reuse rather than recycle."

review/summary: It's all peppermint
review/text: I usually purchase the Vanilla and love it, I did not care for this at all. I put in the normal amount, sipped and found that I inhaled peppermint with barely any taste of chocolate or coffee, I put in 2 more spoonfuls and tried it again..... it tastes a little like chocolate, but it definitely can't replace a trip to your local coffee store. I did like that they have repackaged this and replaced the old tin canisters that it's been in forever.<br /><br />This flavor needs to be worked on

review/text: A real TREAT!!  Peppermint Mocha Latte is so smooth and invigorating with the hint of peppermint flavor and aroma.  A most enjoyable treat any time of day or evening and especially if you want to serve your guest something a bit different from a plain old cup of coffee.  WOW this is good will be heard all around and all you did was add a few teaspoons of powdered mix and add hot water.This came from Amazon on a windy rainy day when I was looking to serve a dear friend something different and it sure hit the spot!!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DGZ1T2">Maxwell House International Cafe Cafe-Style Beverage Mix, Peppermint Mocha Latte 7.1 oz (202 g)</a>

review/summary: Tasty (but doesn't taste like coffee)
review/text: Let me tell you all a secret: I don't actually like coffee that much.  There I said it.  I ordered this product anyway because it sounded really good from the description.  So, now that you know what perspective I'm coming from, let me describe my impression of this drink.<br /><br />Well, it's more like hot chocolate than coffee.  Seriously, my impression is that this tastes very little like coffee and much more like a Peppermint Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa.  That's fine with me, as since I mentioned earlier I don't really care that much for coffee.  So, really, what you've got here is "latte" that tastes like hot chocolate.<br /><br />There are some other issues I should mention, it's very pepperminty - in fact, it may be too strongly peppermint for some people's tastes.  The other issue is that it takes a TON of teaspoons of powder to make a normal average-sized mug.  I think I used like six on one mug.  That's not efficient at all compared to a normal-sized packet of hot chocolate.  Speaking of hot chocolate, since this tastes like hot chocolate, you really should just buy hot chocolate instead because it's a much cheaper, better value per ounce than this stuff.  So, given the things I've mentioned, I can't really recommend this "latte" drink mix to fans of coffee at all, or to fans of hot chocolate just based on price alone.  So really, I guess that means it's just not recommended!

review/summary: Good In Theory Only
review/text: I made this with a few ounces of steamed milk, water, and a little heavy cream. I won't say that it taste bad but I much prefer french vanilla. Also, I'll reiterate what a couple of reviewers have already said: this is not really a latte-especially if you are making with just powder and water.<br /><br />After I tasted it, I tried adding a little instant Folgers to help it along. That, however, did not work. I just hate that I wasted the milk. As a side note, let me say that it wasn't really the peppermint flavor that turned me off. I drink peppermint tea all of the time. I just think adding peppermint to a coffee-type beverage is a bad idea. It reminded me of an Andes mint.

review/summary: Just OK
review/text: I have always seen this item in the coffee section of my local market so I assumed it was coffee based. After trying it several times it certainly tasted to me like a malty hot chocolate drink. The ingredient lists "instant coffee" and no chocolate so it is coffee after all - I was fooled.<br />  I found the taste overly sweet. The item could of used more of the bitterness of the coffee to tone down the sweetness. Nonetheless the item was a pleasant drink on a cold day but nothing out of the ordinary.

review/summary: Maxwell House Has Always Been Our Favorite Brand
review/text: This combination of tastes and smells is great, truly seductive of course.  Maxwell House is an established brand of great reputation, which is why we favor it whenever possible, even without regard to price differentials.<br /><br />For this particular product, there is a tiny bit of unexpected surprise or disappointment of course, since it contains a "hydrogenated" ingredient, which we avoid always.  With more attention to the natural side for this ingredient list, this product could have been a first-class, even preferred item.

review/summary: Review for Peppermint Mocha Latte
review/text: I can definitely taste the mint flavor and the latte does come out foamy like the box says. The mint seems stronger than the usual peppermint lattes that I've gotten at Starbucks before. It's not super sweet but is still sweet enough, unlike the dark mayan chocolate flavor that I've had before. The new packaging is also an improvement since they got rid of the metal rim that used to make it difficult to get out the last bit of powder when the tin is almost empty.

review/summary: Milk = cocoa, coffee = peppermint twist
review/text: I am an adamant lover of coffeehouse peppermint mochas.  It doesn't need to be cold out for me to want a nice, hot cup of chocolate with a cool edge of peppermint in it.  I look for packages of peppermint cocoa, have syrups and adore York's Peppermint patties.  That said, I have expectations of anything that says it is peppermint and chocolate.<br /><br />International Coffees are something I also buy on occasion as an added shot to my normal brewed coffee at home.  I like that it adds flavor and also seems to spike plain brew with a bit more energy; almost like adding a shot of espresso without having to douse the cup with sugar or cream, first.  I like my coffee smooth and sweet.<br /><br />Having my normal use in mind and that of someone who might purchase this item to try as a stand-alone, I did two tests:<br /><br />1) I put a couple of spoonfuls of the powder in the bottom of my cup before adding my brewed coffee<br />2) I heated milk to pour over the powder (I wouldn't use hot water for cocoa, I'm sure not going to use it here)<br /><br />The brewed coffee mix, had a nice strong (but sweet) peppermint taste with a dark edge to the chocolate flavor.  I know the brewed coffee brings out the chocolate a bit more, so I was happy to see that I didn't lose the peppermint in the mix.  The smell didn't carry a lot of the mint, so that was a little disappointing as I was hoping for a full scent and taste experience for the peppermint mocha spike.<br /><br />The heated milk produced a very sweet cup that lost most of the coffee flavor.  Honestly, it ended up tasting like a decent cup of peppermint hot cocoa instead of a mocha.  I started off with only 3/4 of the recommended powder and even that didn't have the hint of coffee while being a bit thin-tasting.  Putting the recommended amount of powder in created a more full-bodied drink, but still wasn't very coffee-esque.<br /><br />So, as an add to my brewed cup, I will definitely keep it.  I honestly think this is the best way to use this product.  For powder mixed with milk or water (gak!), I'll probably skip it because it was a little too sweet.  Though, if I'm out of cocoa, I may consider it as an alternative.

review/summary: Basically Peppermint Hot Chocolate
review/text: This drink mix was good but really nothing special.  Its basically just a strongly peppermint flavored hot chocolate.  Calling it peppermint mocha latte is somewhat of an exaggeration.  Its a fine drink but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to find it again.<br /><br />If you like hot water with just a touch of flavor... you'll like this drink.<br /><br />WEAK WEAK WEAK (when mixed according to pkg directions (which i'm sure are to keep the calories looking low))<br /><br />you really need more than twice as much mix as called for (of course I also put two cocoa packets in one cup for hot cocoa and like strong coffee so perhaps my tastebuds are sensorially challenged)<br /><br />makes a disturbing crackling noise when mix and water meet (like pop rocks candy...very strange)<br /><br />but does have a nice little foam on top for a brief moment<br /><br />When mixed per directions:<br />Peppermint: just right!<br />Mocha: definitely some chocolatyness...but coffee flavor is barely detectable to totally absent<br />(I personally wouldn't want peppermint in my mocha anyway...cocoa definitely...but not in mocha latte which SHOULD have coffee flavor in it)<br /><br />more like a lightly chocolaty mint tea!<br /><br />When mixed 2x strong:<br />Hmm. Still weak-ish. Strongly mint and somewhat chocolatey and no coffee overtones.<br /><br />Should be called Cocoa-infused Mint Tea.<br /><br />Or Peppermint Cocoa at least. Not Mocha.

review/summary: Refreshing and comforting
review/text: I had a cough and sore throat when I tried the peppermint mocha latte. I didn't know if it was such a great idea to try it when I didn't feel well, but the mint appealed to me.<br /><br />I followed the directions and mixed 4 tsp. with about 8 ounces of steaming hot water. I was happy to see that it mixed well - I didn't come across any lumps of unmixed granules while drinking or at the bottom when I was done. There's a nice frothiness to it. And I was right: The peppermint is very soothing. I felt a bit revived after the first few sips. The peppermint is not strong or overwhelming, but it does linger, which I liked. The mocha is very subtle; what stands out is the peppermint. It's just a really nice mix of hot drink with a gentle, chocolate-tinged minty coolness.<br /><br />I don't really have any gripes, because I'm the one who made the drink, but I do think the next time I make a mug of peppermint mocha, I will add another half teaspoon or so - it's not that the drink I made was bad, but I found I wanted it just a touch stronger. The flavor is that good. With 9 carbs and 7 sugars per mug, I felt better health-wise about enjoying it, too. Easy to recommend!

review/summary: Minty
review/text: I was excited to try this product because I thought it was going to be the perfect drink on my cold night.  When I tried it, however, I was disappointed.  The drink was just extremely too minty for me.  It was a menthol overload.  There was too much peppermint and not enough mocha.<br /><br />If you like York Peppermint Patties, you might like this drink.  It is like the liquid version of a peppermint patty.  I didn't enjoy it, but maybe other people will.

review/text: This stuff is super yummy. It took me a little while to figure out how to get the water / powder mixture just right, but that is not a problem. The taste has just the right amount of peppermint for me,too much peppermint (like some other drinks) is a turn off for me. IMHO the peppermint should be a nice accent, no the main "star" of the coffee.<br /><br />Well worth a try, and perfect to have on hand in the winter months for when friends stop by.

review/text: Maxwell House International Coffee Peppermint Mocha Latte is great coffee. I was a little hesitant to try it being I don,t eat sugar, I thought it might be too sweet. This is really good; not too sweet at all. It has a nice mild peppermint taste but the choclate latte still comes thru strong. It is really good especially as we are heading into the holiday season . Its a treat for big kids!! I made it with just the hot water to see how it performed. It was frothy & did'nt rquire milk or anything else. It was good all on its own. Try it I think you will like it !

review/summary: A Bit Light on Flavor
review/text: We're pretty rabid coffee and hot chocolate drinkers at my house.  The Maxwell House International products aren't something we normally buy, but I figured this could be a really nice alternative to the coffee pods in hurry.  Sadly, the Peppermint Mocha Latte experiences left us a bit wanting.<br /><br />First and foremost, the flavor of the Maxwell House Peppermint Mocha Latte isn't bad; however, at the recommended amount of powder to water (4 tsp per 8 oz of water) the flavor is really, really subtle.  I would not recommmend using their recommended amount of powder unless you're looking for something more akin to a tea.<br /><br />When we upped the ratio of powder to water, the product was much better.  The flavors of the peppermint weren't overpowering, and you still get the flavor of the latte coming through just fine.<br /><br />Overall, it's a middling product.  It isn't bad at all, but I think there are better mixes out there if you're really looking for a nice flavor experience.

review/summary: An "instant" classic
review/text: I am a coffee lover, and in general coffee lovers do not like instant coffee.  But Maxwell House's International coffees are not like normal instant coffee.  Their instant coffee is smooth tasting, and their are many varieties to choose from.  The Peppermint Mocha brand that I received can be enjoyed as a latte coffee, or as a hot chocolate type beverage.<br /><br />All you need to do is add one cup of hot (not boiling) water to 4 teaspoonfulls of this latte coffee in a cup.  It is instantly enjoyable.  Initially I felt the flavor was a bit bland, so I added some sugar to mine.  My Husband however enjoyed his cup without sugar and felt it tasted fine without it.<br /><br />It advertised that it could also be used as a hot chocolate type beverage, that all you needed to do to serve it this way was to add the teaspoonfulls of the latte to hot milk instead of hot water.  I asked my son to try it this way, and he did.  My 10 year old did like it, but we did have to add some sugar to make it sweeter. Both my son and I must have a huge sweet tooth.<br /><br />Enjoy this coffee as the nights grow chillier!

review/summary: There's a picture of this next to "Meh" in the dictionary
review/text: With fancy sippin' coffees in general you expect a rich, complicated taste.  This coffee, with PEPPERMINT MOCHA flavor, you expect even more something that knocks you back.  You get... Meh.<br /><br />There's a peppermint flavor.  Not very strong.  I get more flavor by adding small amounts of flavor syrups from the 99cent store.<br /><br />The preparation is a bit touchy.  Directions say add between 6-8oz of boiling water.  I tried 7oz and got hardly any flavor.  With 6oz. it was noticeable but bland.  A bit less than 6oz and a dash of milk was ok.<br /><br />The back of the box says "The New Look of Decadence".  I want DECADENT.  I got mildly flavored coffee or ... "Meh".<br /><br />This is not terrible coffee, just not worth the trouble.

review/text: Although this coffee, like all the International Coffees, is too sweet for me, the mint/mocha flavor is decidedly the best of these products that I've ever tried. It tastes and smells like Christmas! I almost always tone down the sweetness and up the coffee flavor by adding a spoonful of instant coffee to the mix before pouring in boiling water, but I use less of the instant with this flavor because it's so pungent. If you like mint and chocolate, you'll like this one. I'll bet it would taste great iced, too -- it's a seasonal flavor, so this would be one to stock up on if you like it.

review/summary: Very minty. Very sweet. Nice chocolate flavor.
review/text: I'm assuming if you're reading this review that you realize that it's instant coffee, and you know what that means (easy to prepare; often weak; lacks the bold flavor of real coffee). Some of us, like me, prefer the ease and variability of instant coffee - I can make it as strong or as weak as I like! The mint chocolate does a good job of masking the fact that this is instant coffee. My one potentially negative comment would be that the mint is very, hm, fresh (almost bordering on toothpaste) and is the strongest of the flavors.
