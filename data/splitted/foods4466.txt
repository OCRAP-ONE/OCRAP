review/summary: Aunt Was Surprised
review/text: I sent the purple orchids from Just Orchids last week for my aunt's 87th birthday (which was Sunday the 17th).  While I knew the flowers wouldn't be delivered on Sunday they were delivered on Monday afternoon.  (I placed my order on July 15th and the flowers were delivered on July 18th.)  My aunt called and said each flower had a water tube.  When she put them in water the blooms opened.  She received approximately 16 - 17 stems.  I have not ordered from Just Orchids previously but you can bet I will from now on.  The flowers are really a WOW factor!  I paid $32.xx which I believe is not only a GREAT price for flowers but also delivered orchids.  Thanks Just Orchids.  I am recommending to friends/family.

review/summary: Excellent Orchids that lasted for weeks!
review/text: I ordered these orchids for my mother, who lives out of state.  They arrived packaged very carefully and were beautiful.  The arrangement lasted over two weeks and some of the stems of flowers made it more than three weeks, still intact.  My mom was really impressed and I will order again from this company.  I read lots of reviews about flower vendors and this company had consistently earned high stars.  I didn't want to spend money on flowers that wilt or become shabby quickly.  Just Orchids gave me a great product at a good price.

review/summary: Amazing product, highly recommended!
review/text: My cat has had intestinal issues for years. She overgrooms herself and ingests a huge amount of hair, which causes intestinal obstruction or blockage. My cat has also had the tendency to throw up all the time because of hair ingested.  I've had to take her to the vet numerous times for this problem because obstructions can be fatal if not dealt with. Purina hairball formula food was not helping her. I've used this product for a year and it is nothing short of miraculous! No more blockages, no more vomiting, no more vet bills, just a happy cat! I think that this food is good for overall health of any cat.

review/summary: Cat stopped liking it halfway through the case
review/text: Spouse insisted the 20-year-old cat loves the Fancy Feast Beef Feast in Gravy (just that one flavor). Loves it. LOVES it. Eats like she's young again and I absolutely have to start buying it by the case. The cat stopped loving it halfway through the first case, just like I said she would--she's done this before. Is this the cat food's fault? No. The two two-year-old cats think this stuff is the Best. Cat food. Ever. It's shreds and/or small chunks of meat in a gravy rather than the pate type.<br /><br />Now maybe Amazon will stop bugging me to review this product.

review/text: This is the worst dried mango product. I tasted a few and threw away the whole bag. Ingredient doesn't read it used sugar and preservatives. I thought it was natural and no sugar. But when I saw it I think it used bunch of sugar and also used preservative. Well if they missed ingredients that's still ok only if it tastes good because other products also use sugar and preservative. However it was the worst dried mango I ever had. It is neither pleasing nor healthful. I already lost money spending on it and didn't want to lose my health nor bother my mouth with the worst. So, I threw away the whole bag decisively. No attachment. I recommend philipine imported dired mango products. 7D mango is fine. For your reference, I bought some organic or natural dried mangoes. They are quite different from philipine products. They are real dry and somewhat hard rather than soft and chewy like philipine products. They don't taste as good as philpine products, but they use no sugar no preservative.

They are not "crumbly" at all, so don't mess up my pockets during training. Gave it 4 stars instead or 5, because they are very difficult to break into smaller pieces. Ingredients (as in lack of junk) are fabulous for an allergic dog (like mine). My dog loves them.

review/text: Maybe I'm crazy as a lot of the other reviews don't seem to be into this flavor but I absolutely LOVE IT!  I think the regular and triple cheese varieties don't have much flavor but this one totally has a unique flavor and it is great.  I saw it at Walmart during a shopping trip and hadn't tired it so I decided to give it a go.  I bought a few White Cheddars and a few of the originals.  After having a White Cheddar, I had wished I didn't buy the regular ones and that I had only gotten all White Cheddar.  It has such an awesome unique flavor, I am in love!  I went back to Walmart a couple weeks later and they were out of it.  I have gone back 5 or so times since and they either don't carry it anymore or are always out, totally bums me out.  Luckily, I found it online and can not wait until it shows up.  Apparently some don't like this flavor according to a few reviews but hey, I love it so if you haven't tried it, definitely give it a go yourself before believing the haters.

review/summary: The worst thing on the planet
review/text: It's bad enough having to come to terms with the fact that you're on such a tight budget and so incredibly lazy/bad at cooking that you have to resort to buying Kraft Easy Mac in bulk amounts so that you can have something to eat at work - but to try to pass this "White Cheddar" flavor off on the public as if it's some acceptable "flavor"?<br /><br />For shame, Kraft. This particular variety of Easy Mac is by far the worst abomination to come to the planet Earth since...since White Cheddar Easy Mac. Yes, nothing is worse than this flavor. It is like pouring granulated bits of aluminum and chalk into your depressing boiling hot bowl of noodles and then putting aluminum and chalk in your mouth.<br /><br />Me eating Easy Mac usually ends in tears, but this was actually so terrible I threw it out immediately and went to get a hoagie, because, God damn it, sometimes you have to just say "NO! My life DOESN'T have to be THIS BAD!"<br /><br />And if you're thinking of buying this flavor of Easy Mac, please opt for triple cheese like a normal human being.

review/text: I'm a college student, so I Easy Mac is a great quick, good tasting meal. I bought this 12-pack with the Pizza and Extreme Cheese versions. They are much, much better. This White Cheddar Easy Mac tastes awful. It's so bad that I couldn't even finish the first container I tried. A few of my friends think it's OK but no one I've given it to has loved it. It also gets very watery if you add the amount of water it says to. You have to go below the line or it will be like soup.<br /><br />Unless you really like White Cheddar or really want to try it, I would stay away. And if you do want to try it I would suggest purchasing a single bowl somewhere in case you find yourself with 11 extra Easy Mac bowls you have to try to give away to friends.

review/summary: Sugary Apple Chips - For Sugar Lovers
review/text: The first thing I noticed about these chips was that there was loose, sticky cinnamon-flavored sugar all over the inside of the bag.  This makes it very difficult to put your hand in without having it come out coated with sugar granules.  Very very messy and sticky.  The sugar is very over-powering and cinnamon is subtle.  Overall, it's good, but I was disappointed after tasting the original apple chips.  It's for someone who has a very sweet tooth.  Also, if you are familiar with these apple-chips, there are a lot of crumbs--about 1/3 crumbs.  If you are down to the last third of the bag, expect half of what you pop into your mouth to be sugar.

review/summary: Crisp, tasty snack for an occasional treat!
review/text: These crispy apple chips are just that.  Unlike dehydrated apples, which are chewy, these chips are super thin and crispy.  But they get that crispiness because of the oil added when they make them.  Sure they have less fat than potato chips, but don't kid yourself that these are a low-fat snack.<br /><br />Still, these chips are a fantastic treat when you want something that crunches much like a potato chip, and they have much less fat and far more flavor than a potato chip.  But there's another trade off - you don't have the sodium of potato chips, but you do have extra sugar.<br /><br />I originally found these chips in my local coop at about twice the price I'm paying for them on Amazon, so I was thrilled to find them here.  Even at the high price, I occasionally bought a bag.  With the lower price, I can keep them on hand.<br /><br />All in all, despite the fact that these aren't the most nutritious snack out there and they're more expensive than an individual bag of potato chips, I keep them in my cupboard as I (and my family) love them.  There are supposedly 2.5 servings a bag, but I doubt many of us get that many servings out of a bag.  These chips are really tasty and satisfying - and once you open a bag, you'll likely keep eating until they're all gone.<br /><br />Why do I give these five stars despite the fat, sugar, and price?  They're one of the best light, crunchy treats I've found and they're incredibly tasty.  I love 'em!

review/summary: Five Star Taste, with some caveats
review/text: These apple chips are incredible-tasting, so I give the product 5-stars.  They're sweet, slightly tart, and fried--what can be better?  As you've seen from other reviewers, it's easy to eat a whole bag in one sitting.  They taste great, because they're cooked in oil and does have a little less fat than potato chips.<br /><br />Besides the "non-healthiness" of it, the box of 12 arrived at my door completely beaten up.  The package tape was unraveling and the box looked like it had just come back from a war zone--slightly smooshed and tearing at the seams.  There are no buffers or packaging materials in the box, with only the apple chip bags in there.  Thus, half of my chips were really just crumbs.<br /><br />I bought one bag in the store and there were quite a few crumbs in there too.  I wish the chips came more whole.  I'm not sure what everyone else's shipping experience was like, but I was a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Update: I've since purchased another couple of boxes and Amazon has placed the original apple chip boxes into an Amazon.com boxes.  This kept the chips from being mangled too much.  Thanks Amazon!<br /><br />Also, FYI: watch out for the stems!

They're almost as good as I remember: crispy, sweet (but not too sweet), with a touch of cinamon = yummy! But all 12 bags were crushed into small pieces and they were hard to pick up, and I felt that I was eating someone's left-over.  Better packing would make a huge difference.

review/summary: Not the Apple Chip I was expecting
review/text: If you're looking for a dried apple that is healthy without any extra stuff (i.e. oil or corn syrup), this is NOT the item.  They are fried. I somehow missed the part where it mentioned that they were fried.  Apparently I was mislead by the "Good health" title.  Hopefully you'll read this before you purchase if you were intending on purchasing dried apples, not FRIED apples.  I also have 11 bags that I now need to figure out what to do with because they were not what I intended.

review/summary: Delicious to snack on; perfect for entertaining!
review/text: These crackers are simply delicious. They are perfect for snacking on at home or for entertaining. Our guests are always asking about them: what they are and where we purchased them. I use to get them from a big chain wine distributor here in the Midwest but then I realized it was a lot cheaper to get them through auto delivery at Amazon. The cracker has a rich flaky taste with a good hard crunch and the rosemary/olive flavor enhances the cracker perfectly. I highly recommend these!

review/summary: Great chips
review/text: Hi:<br /><br />I bought a 24 pack of these 2 ounce bags (size you would get at Quiznos or Subway with a sandwich) since they were less than I could get them at Costco in a equal pack of Frito chips. I had tried previously by buying a bag at my local Albertsons and they are good. Good chip for dipping sicne they're a little thicker than Lays. The chips are fresh, crisp and great tasting; perfect for putting a bag lunch for work or school.<br /><br />NOTE: Bags are made extra thick paper with a plastic lining for freshness and very difficult to open by hand. Use a knife or scissors.

review/summary: Ranch isn't only good with tortilla chips....
review/text: I have been a longtime fan of Kettle Potato Chips, since I was a small child. The terrific texture and "crunch" of their product never leaves me disappointed - what's more, the high quality ingredients that go into the top-of-the-line flavors they have are first rate. Zesty Ranch does not fail to disappoint me. The Ranch flavor has a terrific, zippy quality (like the flavor name would suggest). It livens up your taste buds, and I am pleased to say that it isn't too salty, nor too greasy. Each chip is packed to it peak with flavor, and it is far from skimped upon. You almost don't need any dip or sauce of any kind on this snack. It speaks for itself. Highly recommended. Makes me want to go crunch on some right now!

review/summary: Most of the Bags were open
review/text: I've eaten these Krinkle Cut Salt and Pepper Chips for years.  I was very excited to find them on Amazon.  I bought the 24 pack specifically so they would be fresh every time I opened them (opposed to buying an 8 or 12 oz larger bag).<br /><br />When I went to get a bag this evening, I noticed they were slightly open and the chips were stale.  I checked the rest of the bags in the box and most of them were open.  I think it may have to do with the oil on the chips.  They seeped into the seal and loosened the glue.<br /><br />I called into Amazon Customer Service and the CSR was pretty rude.  The first question she asked was why I didn't report this earlier.  Duh, maybe because I didn't notice the problem until now?  I've been very happy with Amazon's Customer Service in the past and have been buying 100s of dollars product during this Christmas season.  Hopefully this was just a cranky CSR and not indicative of Amazon's direction for customer service.

review/summary: Yummy chips!
review/text: My son and I agree. These are fine flavored potato chips! The Kettle brand has a lot of interesting variations on flavoring. This is one of those we like best from their stable of goodies.<br /><br />I went to graduate school in Buffalo, lived in Western New York for years, and frequented the Anchor Bar, where chicken wings were invented. So I rather like the cheekiness of referring to Buffalo wings in this product!<br /><br />And these are tasty indeed. I would prefer a bit more of the bite/heat of a Buffalo chicken wing, but that is not a serious issue. I find it amazing that this product can even hint at the pleasures of Buffalo chicken wings!

They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know. They are much more flavorful. Never had this flavor before. before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!<br /><br />These arrived in a case of individually wrapped chips. Each one was in great shape. No open or broken bags. No mess, no crumbs.<br /><br />If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: What I like about them:<br />1) Krinkle makes very thick chips, what's even better is that the krinkle cut chips feel even thicker because they are krinkled or have ridges in them.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing. I like the peppery flavor of these.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

Those thick ridges also allows more of the seasoning to stay on the chip. The pepper in this really stands out so if you're not a fan of fresh ground pepper flavor then don't buy this. These chips are rich, bold and delicious. The quality of the potatoes used are excellent. I can't wait to try the other flavors.

review/summary: Good flavor
review/text: These chips have great flavor as is but I am more into the buffalo wings flavor more than the bleu cheese flavor, but it's a combo that seems to work well, I probably would like it even more if it just had the heat and flavor of just the buffalo wing sauce. And you cannot beat the crunch on these.

review/summary: Buffalo Bleu
review/text: I bought cases of the large bags of Buffalo Bleu, New York Cheddar and a medium sized case of Spicy Thai.  The cheddar kind of tastes like pringles to me, but the others in my family really like them.  The thai is really good, but they aren't that much different than barbecue chips with a sprinkle of ginger flavor.  But the Buffalo Bleu IS AWESOME!  These are the absolutely best chips I have ever eaten.  The funny thing is that the bleu's were the ones that I thought I would probably regret getting.  They are awesome.  I will buy again.  And again.  And again.<br /><br />I would suggest, though, if you get them to get the smallest bag size or else you will do what my family and I have done:  finish a bag every other day.  The smallest bag might be the most expensive per ounce but they will probably last longer.

review/summary: Always delicious and always expensive
review/text: Kettle chips are always delicious,though a little expensive considering they're just potatoes.  WAY better than anything Frito-Lays puts out.  It's a shame that the independent chip companies are dying out at the local grocers because Frito-Lays crowds them out, when the independents are so much better.  Take a trip to your local Trader Joe's or Amazon to find good chips nowadays, and cheap too if you find them on sale here, cheap all the time at Trader Joe's.

review/summary: A very tasty chip!
review/text: These chips are crisp, tangy and a nice change from barbecue flavor chips.  If you like spicy foods, you'll love these.  The blue cheese is not at all overwhelming, just adds that extra "bite."  The box of chips arrived well packed, nothing broken, and the expiration date was over 3 months in advance, making this a very good value, considering the 20% discount Amazon had during November.

review/summary: OK but not great
review/text: First off the krinkle cut chips are far inferior to the regular style kettle chips in my opinion.  Secondly, the flavor doesn't really capture the taste of buffalo wings or bleu cheese.  They taste kinda weird.  It's probably not the best type of flavor to put on a potato chip, even though I love wings.

review/text: A big fan of kettle-cooked chips since I was a kid, I tend to go around buying any and all brands and flavors I can find.  As a result, Buffalo Bleu was on my list.<br /><br />I was in for a real surprise when I got my hands on this flavor.  It has a great taste -- not too sweet, not too salty -- and a nice crunch.  There's not really anything else to say; if you like good chips, give these a try.

review/summary: One of the healthier chips
review/text: Simple, uncomplicated and healthy ingredients. Cooked in expeller pressed oils (not heated to extract, which causes loss of nutritional value), Kettle chips have a firmer texture than most others, but they have great flavor, even though no flavor enhancers are used except for the spices. No preservatives is also a plus. My only negative experience with them is an occasional bag in which the chips in the very bottom of the bag are oily. I was so pleased to find them at a price nearly a third less than what I have been paying in the grocery market.

review/text: These are nothing more than barbecue potato chips.  Covered with a dusting of chili powder, salt, and sugar, I would not buy these again. I really love blue cheese, but I can't taste it in these chips. I should never buy anything I haven't tried, and now I'm stuck with all these bags of chips that I don't like. I have tried the salt and cracked pepper flavor and wish I had bought them instead.

review/summary: A salty, spicy crispy delight!
review/text: This flavor of Kettle chips is my favorite.  I always need to have a few of these bags laying around for a good movie or sporting event.  Krinkle cut happens to be my favorite type of chip and kettle chip delivers on these.  Not only are the chips always crispy and fresh, but they have a perfect coating of salt and pepper.<br /><br />That coating creates a nice blend of salt w/ a bit of nice black pepper kick that lets you know the chip is willing to give a bit of bite before surrendering.  I've gotten a few boxes of these over the past year and have had no problems with the chips or unbalanced flavoring.  Once again Kettle delivers a fantastic product that delights the taste buds

review/summary: Stale, too oily to touch and tasted weird
review/text: I ve had this exact kind a ton of times at my local deli and love their taste, figured i d save a bunch by getting a box of 24 delivered to my desk at work. Unfortunately, I think they unloaded their oldest/worst batch on me. The chips tasted stale, leached out a ton of oil ( I m not kidding, felt like I was eating pizza given how much oil i was leaching out with a napkin from each individual chip!) and the taste was just off. I think with all the oil that leached out, it upset the flavor balance of the chip and now they just taste really salty and stale.<br /><br />Tried 3 different bags, and it was the same in each case (couldnt eat more than a couple of chips, they were that bad). Got in touch with Amazon customer care, and they were kind enough to get me a refund, but i recommend that you save yourself the hassle and give these a miss.

review/summary: Taste good but NOT truly MSG-FREE
review/text: I bought 2 cases of these chips because I heard nothing but great things about this brand and this flavor of chip in particular. However, upon receiving them today, I saw that although they state NO MSG, they DO contain Yeast Extract which acts exactly as MSG does and therefore I cannot eat them. Unfortunately ALL Kettle chips contain this ingredient so I am unable to eat any of them. I don't think I can return them but I got them at a cheap price so I will donate them or see if Amazon can let me return them since the description was a bit misleading. These chips are MUCH healthier than many other brands, so if you are not MSG sensitive, I say dig in!

We really like the Sea Salt & Pepper chips but were unable to obtain a package larger than 5 ounces in the local stores, at a much higher price than at Amazon.com. While we would like to have the ability of getting a larger size bag, say 24-32 ounces, it was nice to be able to get the 9 ounce bag of chips. The price was very good and the free shipping was great!

review/summary: Check the label
review/text: The fact that Kettle Foods claims their products are "All Natural" really, really, really upsets me. These chips, and many other Kettle chips, contain "yeast extract." On a chemical level, yeast extract is the same thing as MSG; it's just derived from a different source. Kettle labels some of their products with "NO MSG," but their reps say people who are sensitive to glutamates should avoid their products. Be an informed consumer.

review/text: I remember this popcorn from my childhood, so I was so excited to see it on Amazon. The popcorn bag is just like regular microwave popcorn. After it pops, you cut up the solid caramel block and place it on top of the popped corn in a bowl. After another zap in the microwave, you stir it around until it becomes gooey, delicious caramel popcorn. It's sticky, but it doesn't stick to your hands. I suggest sorting out the unpopped kernels before adding the caramel, as they become stuck to the popped kernels and difficult to see. This is the tastiest caramel popcorn, and I highly recommend it over dry caramel popcorn.

review/text: My hubby got this because it was on sale. We made it as a snack while watching late night TV. I actually went online to make sure we followed the directions correctly. The cooking instructions on the packaging were difficult to read. The final product was soooo delicious. If one were to think that fiddle faddle is edible; this caramel corn ROCKS!! After cooking the popcorn, I would suggest doing the best you can to eliminate all of the kernels. Then cut the caramel into several pieces (we did 8) and then place them on top of the popcorn; which is in a microwave safe bowl. After about a minute more in the microwave, take out and mix well. Easy Peasy. Enjoy.

Tip(for some reason the instructions on the box don't match the one on the package!) - pour the popped popcorn out into a microwave safe bowl. Then cut the caramel wafer up in to 6-8 pieces and scatter them on top of the corn, it will make it easier to mix once it's melted. be sure to watch it carefully but also to heat it long enough till it starts to just bubble a little bit! Then mix and enjoy. love love love it! Ordering more now!

review/summary: Rose Flavor WIthout the Perfume
review/text: There are a lot of exotic and fancy offerings from Red Leaf, but sometimes you just need something basic, simple but lovely. Rose is that flavor for me, I love it in tea, cakes, candies, anything! So I really wanted to try it out with matcha. I really like perfume-y flavors, but most people don't. In the bag this smells like a perfume store, seriously strong! But once mixed up into a nice iced latte, the rose is smooth and really only slightly floral. It's like rose candies: sweet (the most naturally sweet matcha I've tried) and with a good rose flavor but with no perfume notes. I think people who only kind of like floral teas would even love this!
