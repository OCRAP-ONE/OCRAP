review/summary: Not so Good
review/text: I ordered this grind by mistake, and it wasn't a happy mistake either. I always buy Van Houtte Medium Blend cups and Kenya Blend...I love themn both, but this stuff doesn't hold up.<br />Bitter after taste and lousy finish, I never have been a big fan of Columbian coffees, this reinforces it.

review/summary: Van Houtte Coffee
review/text: This is a great buy especially when you calculate the "per cup".  However, The taste isn't quite as bold as I expected it to be and find myself "choosing" from my selection other brands.  This however is great for flavored coffee - adding a spoonful of chocolate for a mocha.

review/summary: Only Four Simple Ingredients...
review/text: Walker's Shortbread contains only four ingredients: flour, butter, sugar, and salt. Unlike like other packaged cookies, there's no unpronounceable garbage designed to make them taste "good" or last for decades on a store shelf. They taste good because they are good, and they stay fresh because they're individually wrapped. The shortbread is still made in Scotland, as it has been for over 100 years.<br /><br />If you've never had a Walker's Shortbread, you're missing out on one of life's simple pleasures. Buy a box, you'll love 'em.

review/summary: Believe It Or Not... Can Be Diet Food!
review/text: This review is of Walkers Shortbread Rounds (1.2-Ounce), 2-Count Cookies (Pack of 24).<br /><br />As every seasoned dieter knows, getting the weight off is only half the battle. Keeping it off requires equal diligentness.<br /><br />For those mid-afternoon sweet snack cravings, granola bars became a staple around our house. One package of two bars of the peanut butter variety comes in at 180 calories. With all the different flavors available, and the low cost, they have proven to be indispensable to managing my weight. That said, granola did become a bit tiresome over time.<br /><br />Over the holidays, a package arrived that included some of these individually packaged Walkers Shortbread Rounds (cookies). Reviewing the calories, I was surprised to see that, calorie wise, they run the same as granola bars.<br /><br />The calories run the same, but the cookies provide a totally different mouth feel and a butter flavor rush that cannot be beat. The individual packs keep me on track with portion control, thank goodness, because I could probably eat ten to fifteen of these little pallet pleaser's in one sitting.<br /><br />Cost wise, granola bars are the winner, but I have found substituting these shortbread cookies a couple of times a week mixes things up just enough to not grow tired of either.<br /><br />When these last holidays passed, I found it necessary to go back into full fledged dieting mode for a few weeks. While whipping up a batch of lemon flavored fat and sugar free pudding one day, I was getting ready to pour it into individual cups and remembered the shortbread cookies. I split two packs between four cups, placing one cookie at the bottom of each, and the poured in the pudding.<br /><br />Yes, adding one shortbread round to each serving increases the calorie count by ninety, but the cookie addition on the bottom acts as a crust, resulting in something very similar to a much higher calorie count cream pie! Delicious, luscious and filling, I used different flavors of pudding to create a variety of lower calorie cream mini-pies. The non-dieters in the house enjoyed them immensely too and none were the wiser that they were eating diet desserts a couple of times a week.<br /><br />Dieting or not, the cookies taste fabulous. Yes, you could do some major damage if you just let yourself go and dove into a box, so moderation is key. For those, like me, that sometimes find moderation challenging, go for the individually wrapped option to help maintain a sense of decorum.

review/text: These cookies are the quintessential shortbread: Rich flavor with lots of butter and sugar, nothing else.  Add them crumbled to a bowl of berries and you have instant pie.  I started using them for dessert when company comes to dinner because people love them so much, and they are no work at all. You get two cookies per packet, which is just the right serving size.

review/summary: Convenient packaging
review/text: I ordered these because they were on sale. I ordered this configuration because I thought they would stay fresh longer. We live by the ocean and anything crunchy becomes very uncrunchy very quickly, so a big all-in-one box of crunchy cookies lasts (usually) about a third of the way through. Anyway, sure enough, seemed like this was going to work, but turns out some of the packages are a bit stale. Most, however, are not.

review/text: When I first tried this product, I wasn't sure what to expect from the descriptor "ground" tomatoes. It is pleasantly chunky, thick and pure organic tomato goodness with a bit of sea salt. It is a perfect base for gazpacho, pasta sauce, and any number of other recipes. I have not reliably found it in stores so I ordered a case through Amazon and saved over a dollar per can.

They have no metalic taste like some canned tomatoes do.  I find they offer a rich, fresh tomato taste when making sauce.  They also have the advantage of being more readily available as well as more affordable then some of the imports.  I would recommend them.

review/summary: pass on the bpa.
review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Everyday Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

review/summary: Fantastic Smoky Flavor
review/text: Tapatio salsa picante is one of my favorite hot sauces.  The flavor is more smoky and complex than Tabasco and other popular hot sauces.  Although it goes perfectly with almost any kind Mexican or Southwestern food, it's also a great compliment to a variety of other dishes, including spaghetti and soups.  In addition, the sodium content is relatively low - 110mg per teaspoon (many comparable brands have 200-250mg), making it an excellent, low-sodium way to add flavor to your food.  Most highly recommended.

review/summary: Medium Heat - nice flavor - a tad too much Salt. 3 sizes: 5, 10, 32oz.  The larger size is the better buy.  Recommended!
review/text: I really like this sauce. It is a great blend! While there is nothing truly remarkable about it - more importantly - it has no obvious flaws.  It simply has a nicely balanced flavor and that alone is quite rare in hot sauces!!!! This sauce could or should be a staple in any kitchen.  I'm glad to have a bottle in my pantry.<br /><br />I would rate this sauce somewhere between mild and medium hot. You'll need more than a couple of drops but not much more than that to generate some heat in any dish. Compared to Tabasco's original you'll need about twice the number of drops.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Water, Red Peppers, Salt, Spices, Garlic, Acetic Acid (a component of vinegar), etc ......<br /><br />Note the relatively low level of vinegar within the sauce. That is a good thing. The type of red pepper is unknown but there is a natural sweetness to this sauce which I find quite pleasant. That sweetness balances nicely against the heat. View this sauce as a superior alternative to a very common benchmark - the original Tabasco hot sauce.<br /><br />Minor flaws: There is a bit too much salt in this sauce but that only becomes evident when used in an already heavily salted dish. For example: This is not the best choice for a Bloody Mary due to the heavily salted nature of most vegetable/tomato juices.<br /><br />Since this sauce is available in 5 oz, 10 oz and 32 oz sizes - you'd be wise to pick up the 32oz size given the fact that it often costs little more than the smaller sizes.<br /><br />This is a fine basic hot sauce with a natural sweetness to it. This sauce is worthy of being a staple in any kitchen. It is better than most. What it lacks is that rare sense of freshness and, as noted, there is also a bit too much salt.<br /><br />Watch out for some sellers who offer a low product cost combined with very high shipping charges on a per bottle basis

review/text: We've been eating these pears for over 2.5 years at least twice a day.  Gerber's organic variety is the cheapest price per oz I've found for an "organic pear-only" baby food.  Amazon's price (without Prime) is slightly less than our local grocery store when purchased at regular price.  This is the best price I've found outside special sales.  Contrary to the other review, almost all baby food is "cooked" via some method, usually steaming - even if homeade - which I did for a long time before switching to packaged versions for convenience and inaccessibility to organic produce.  The homeade raw puree works better for her child, but this product has been great for us.  It's been solving our constipation issues for over two years, and it works wonderfully!

I recommend other brands like Earth's Best which seem to be more careful about their ingredients.

review/summary: Gerber's fruits are cooked
review/text: I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?

They have a very long shelf-life (over 1 year) unlike many of the other milk-based T-Discs (such as the latte and cappuccino discs, as well as the hot chocolate), so as something nice to have on hand for a chilly morning or rainy afternoon, this is a great option. I only wish Tassimo would start putting out more decaf options...

English Breakfast is one of my favorites from Twinings and these do not disappoint. A good stout morning tea (that you can add a little creamer to) and a second cycle with each disc doesn't detract much at all from the strength and flavor. I will purchase these again.

So far I have tried alfredo, tomato sauce and even spaghetti carbonara and they all taste wonderful. The garlic is very subtle so it does not interfere with the taste of whatever you sauce it with. This pasta even reheats well in case you make too much and have to eat leftovers. I will be reordering this again very soon as my supply has almost run out and it is very hard to find tasty and affordable organic pasta.

review/summary: Healthy and tasty!
review/text: I have been consuming DeBoles pasta products for about 7 years now since it is healthier than regular white flour pasta - DeBoles uses Jerusalem artichoke flour instead.  This particular flavor is fantastic with just a little butter and Italian spices, or with traditional red sauce on it. The garlic is subtle and barely noticeable.  I hate parsley but love this pasta because I can't tell there's parsley in it.  It cooks quickly and I would advise dropping a few dashes of olive oil into the boiling water to prevent the spaghetti strands from sticking together.  Do not overcook because it will get pasty and gummy.  I have ordered at least 3 cases from Amazon since my favorite store no longer carries this flavor.  I highly recommend DeBoles.

review/summary: Best Iced Tea EVER.
review/text: I've tasted a lot of hot and iced teas and this one takes the cake.  This product primarily considered for making hot tea, but in my opinion, this is the absolute BEST tasting bagged tea for making Iced Tea.  It is such a remarkable flavor even without adding any sugar at all.  Along with this "AriZona Green Tea with Pomegranate and Acai" tea, I also enjoy the "AriZona Mandarin Orange Green Tea with Ginseng & Honey Jasmine".  Both are excellent for hot or iced tea.  I've always liked pretty much anything with the name Arizona on it (including mixes, cans, bottles, etc), but Arizona struck gold with these bagged teas (and Arizona has one of the coolest websites I've seen).<br /><br />Take 5 bags and let sit in two cups of hot water for a couple hours waiting for it to cool so it will get strong.  Take the bags out and pour the concentrated tea into a 2 quart pitcher and fill the rest of the way with filtered tap water.  Put in refrigerator or add ice.<br /><br />Update: I have since also tried the Arizona Pomegranate tubs (makes 2 Qts) and is great.  I'm sure the Stix (put in 16.9 oz bottle) is also just as good, though I haven't tried those yet.

review/text: EdenSoy is a brand that I have come to trust. We try to only eat organic and natural healthy foods, and all of the EdenSoy products are pantry staples in our home. They adhere to the highest standards for both product and manufacturing processes, far exceeding the requirements for organic certification. This is the most delicious soy milk we have tried, and I like that it is enriched with vitamins. The chocolate is good but our daughter loves the vanilla the best. (Carob is also great if Amazon ever decides to carry it). I use any of the flavors to mix up my protein vitamin shakes - YUM! Add frozen banana slices and ice to the chocolote soy milk, blend, and you have a delicious healthy breakfast smoothie that the kids will love! Great to have milk in a shelf-stable package -- just chill a few for school lunches, toss them in your picnic cooler, or pour over ice when you want to enjoy a healthy delicious drink. I used to order cases directly from EdenSoy (at high shipping cost due to weight!) Now I am SO happy that Amazon is carrying this soymilk (and other EdenSoy products) with free super-saver shipping!!

review/text: thank the Creator for this ketchup!  its the only *organic* ketchup i could find that DIDNT have a source of monosodium gluatmate like the other brands (under different names of course, like autolyzed yeast extract, natural flavors, or malt syrup).<br /><br /> im really pleased with this product, and i try to buy from the annies naturals brand because theyre one of the very few out there that have a great deal products that are organic AND MSG-free.

review/summary: Gread product, LOUSY PACKING to protect it!
review/text: The stars are misleading... the product itself is excellent, but the care in which it was packaged by Amazon caused the plastic bottles to break in transit.  UPS has a habit of throwing things around, and the top layer of bubble wrap did NOT protect the bottles.  (They should be ENTIRELY wrapped!)  This is the third time we've had to "eat" the cost of a food product that was broken in transit, so we figured we should say something.  The caps broke off, so only two of the six bottles were left with intact caps.  The sealing protector came off of one of the bottles without a cap.  Two bottles were "squished".  I have photos if anyone wants to see! Grrrr!

review/summary: So Delish!
review/text: I have gotten sick of these big companies selling us products that are filled with fake things.  Even the sugar-free Heinz has fake sugar in it!  So I was totally excited when I found Annie's Ketchup at Target.  I was very close to making my own....but this is basically the same thing!  I love it!  It's got a little zip of tartness that makes it SO addicting!  I have a very hard time getting ketchup when we go out to eat now because it's sooo sweet.  Give it a try- and you will be saying Heinz who?

review/summary: Fantastic Organic, MSG free, Ketchup
review/text: Annie's Naturals ketchup wowed me from the second I tried it. After trying what seemed like every organic ketchup out there, I had given up on finding one that was free of Monosodium glutamate. While the other ketchups I had tried tasted fine, I wanted to know that I wasn't putting any MSG into my body. I struck gold with this one. No dubious words like "spices," "natural flavors," or any non-organic ingredients. Annie's Naturals ketchup lists all of its ingredients and, except for the water and sea salt, all are organic, meaning free of pesticides and genetically modified organisms.<br /><br />As far as the taste goes, it is slightly more tangy than your average ketchup, but I enjoy it far more than the Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Muir Glen, and Organicville ketchups I have tried. For a jumping off point, it is pretty comparable to the Trader Joe's ketchup.<br /><br />I highly recommend this ketchup.

review/summary: Fantastic Ketchup!
review/text: I've always been a ketchup fanatic... putting it on practically everything. However, I never enjoyed the taste of Hunts, Heinz, and a few other large name brands. There were a few local smaller brands that I've purchased in the past that I can no longer find... so I've made due with the "whatever is on sale" approach lately.<br /><br />My ketchup addictions aside, I've been trying to eat more "healthy" in the past year or so. I was randomly searching across products on Amazon and stumbled onto Annie's. I was very skeptic to try a brand I knew nothing about, especially when it claimed to be "natural" or "organic"... but I convinced myself to give it a shot. I'm VERY glad I did. This ketchup has the best flavor of any I have tried to date! I will definitely be a future customer... no doubt about it.

review/text: I had high expectations for this ketchup based on the reviews but am not satisfied. The consistency is too liquid and it doesn't stay on my burgers. The taste of the first bottle I opened is overly strong with too much spice or something else like a bad tomato. Just to be sure I opened a second bottle which tastes better yet is still too liquid to stay on my burgers. I bought the Muir Glen product last time and this is a thicker ketchup that tastes better.

review/summary: Amazon's # 1 in Ketchup! [At time of this review's post]
review/text: As Robert B. Parker's SPENSER would say:<br /><br />"Me, too."<br /><br />Those who have read many Spenser detective novels will have worthy clues why I used that quote as a confirmation of this product. Those who want the luxury of more clues can allow themselves the joy of reading some of that series which, among other treats, tracks eating evolution from the 70's through present day.<br /><br />[NOTE that this is done in typical RBP minimalism, meaning that the series is not a true culinary giving high focus to cooking scenes, but that those scenes which do grace this series reek of "oh yeah" balsamic flavor.]<br /><br />[At the end of this review is a link to the first book in the Spenser series.]<br /><br />Between reading splurges, a reader might consider baking his favorite recipe of meatloaf... for himself alone but not lonely [or maybe lonely], baking liberal sloshes of this ketchup all over the top and sides of it. He might skip the Jack Daniels as beverage choice this time.<br /><br />Sorry Spenser, though I admire you beyond measure, we differ in at least two counts:<br /><br />1. When I need to hold my cup with two hands it will be half full, not of bourbon, but of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ESSASK">Cameron's Organic French Roast Whole Bean Coffee, 32-Ounce Bag</a>. My 1/8 liver function since before I was old enough to imbibe [so I couldn't/didn't] can still handle coffee, but not bourbon.<br /><br />Such is life?<br /><br />Now you [RBP] know about Life, without doubt, oh master of literary detective fiction. I'll bet you've seen a LOT from your current "residence" gracefully provided from the time of your death January, 2010.<br /><br />[The second count above is not relevant in this case, lol.]<br /><br />Returning to Annie's divine organic Ketchup...<br /><br />Even though Spenser was what I might call a balsamic gourmand [Nero Wolfe, too?]... maybe because of that, I believe he would be buying organic, no soy, no extra stuff added other than whole foods which normally and essentially make up a genuine, non-synthetic, no push recipe. I think that he would buy many of these types of products on Amazon, even though a few reviews here seem to have relished ripping [some did so with truly excellent literary sarcasm] his products' evolution of style, and His Susan. [Check out RBP's official web site to see his family photos, read and hear interviews, and listen to Bob and son singing "Moon River"!]<br /><br />On the other hand, I'm sure that Spenser, not RB, since RB like Hemingway had his reasons for not reading reviews, read and enjoyed rave reviews on his shenanigan stories captured by RB. [Yes, fictional characters, too, can read reviews, at least within my fertile mind and vicarious imagination, lol!]<br /><br />So, what [IMO] is the common ingredient in Spenser's character and Annie's product?<br /><br />It's something their human creators are aware of, from the bottom of their souls and soles of their lively feet, whether bare, gumshoed, or sandaled:<br /><br />***When you try to force INTEGRITY against itself you might meet a collection of very angry genomes [or Quantum Base Structures, QBS a la me], or a righteous army of them. The price they might extract could be ugly... Sorry! More LGS sci-fi infestation here, lol... or is X-Files bleeding through?]***<br /><br />If Robert B. Parker and Annie know anything [and they've probably assimilated a lot of knowledge], they know the LAWS OF INTEGRITY. Or they've discerned some of them over incredibly productive lifetimes. [In my view RBP's spirit still exists, still knows things, and still sees, reads... so I feel okay using present tense in reference to his consciousness.]<br /><br />To avoid [this requires tongue-in-cheek] the above starred tragedy, here's an option to pay the dues ahead of time:<br /><br />1. Order this ketchup here, right now [after you finish reading this review].<br /><br />2. Bake your favorite recipe of meatloaf [alter it slightly to "go with" this culinary ambiance if necessary] using this flavor rich tomato concoction, slathering it all over the top and sides.<br /><br />3. Put the ketchup bottle on the table so, if you need to, you can dump more onto the slices, over any bites which don't have the top layer of ketchup on them.<br /><br />4. The rest of this healing, invigorating process will instinctively take its momentum to completion, from satisfaction of the above 3 initiations of action.<br /><br />5. If you need something to spark this process, read the product ingredients lists, and gleeful customer reviews.<br /><br />As restaurant servers sometimes say to irritate me even when I like them, ENJOY!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440129613">The Godwulf Manuscript (#1 in Robert B. Parker's Spenser series)</a>. [A great collection of reviews await, including mine.]

review/text: This particular foil cutter is the BEST!  It's flexible and will adapt to any shape or size neck of the bottle, and is easy to use and cuts 100% of the foil 100% of the time.  I recieved one as a gift and didn't appreciate how good it was until I thought I'd lost it.  I got another foil cutter (the rigid round kind) and hated it.  I got another foil cutter (the rigid oval kind that you have to juggle around the neck) and I hated it.  There was a foil cutting knife on one of my corkscrews but it was dangerous and erratic in my hands. I searched department stores, liquor stores, etc. and didn't have the good luck to find another one of these...having lost the one, I didn't know a brandname and the clerks looked at me like a madwoman when I tried to describe a "flexible horseshoe thingy" to them.<br /><br />To make a long story short: the happy ending is that I found my original foil cutter in a knapsack pocket and now I can live happily ever after.  But THIS is the make and model that I had searched and searched for:  in my humble opinion, the BEST.

review/summary: A great healthy snack if a bit pricey - when can we subscribe for it?
review/text: A half-pack of this usually suffices when a craving for SOMEthing to snack on fights the knowledge of blood sugar readings that are borderline for type 2 diabetes.  It seems like almost nothing when biting into it, but expands almost instantly to a more substantial texture and releases interesting flavor that belies its almost total lack of carbs, fat, and other no-nos.  However, it is also just about free of GOOD food values as well, such as fiber.  Still, it does help me avoid eating something much worse, and is most enjoyable, although others might not like it as much as I do.  I think it costs about two or three times as much as it should, but this is the best price I could find for it.  Amazon does not yet offer it by subscription, which would bring a price improvement and freedom from having to place repeat orders.

review/summary: short-lived flavor (compared to regular Orbit gum)
review/text: I went through a piece of gum while writing this review--maybe 5-10 minutes? If you hate gum that gets stale quick, avoid this like the plague. If you're fine literally going through a pack a day (or a pack every few hours, if you like to constantly chew gum), this isn't bad.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-GREAT, FRESH FLAVOR: I love how intensely minty gum is--the initial burst of flavor is comparable to an Altoids mint. Leaves your mouth feeling very clean. Flavor is much more intense than regular Orbit gum.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-SHORT-LIVED: Gum gets stale just as fast as those $.25 gumball candies. The wonderful flavor lasts about all of 30 seconds before it begins to dissolve into an unappealing, flavorless mass. You know that feeling when your gum tastes gross because it's so old, but you don't have anywhere to throw it away? I get that feeling less than 10 minutes in. A regular individually wrapped piece of Orbit gum could last me over an hour.<br />-NOT TOOTH-WHITENING: That bit of advertising is a bit misleading. I don't think it doesn't anything to whiten teeth moreso than gum normally would--just by nature of being sugarless and picking up pieces of plaque. If you were expecting some tasty tooth whitener, look elsewhere. This doesn't affect my opinion of the gum because I never expected it to, but just throwing it out there.

review/summary: Way too expensive - Title deceiving
review/text: Wabash Valley Farms Kettle Corn All-Inclusive Popping Kits, 3-Count Pouches (Pack of 3), would make one believe that you would be receiving 9 pouches of popcorn kits (3 count pouches X pack of 3).  I received the item yesterday and to my dismay, there was a single box of kettle corn in the USPS box.  The single box contained 3 pouches.  I paid $12.94 for 3 pouches of popcorn ($4.31 a piece).  If you have ever purchased popcorn kits online before you would know that they are not that expensive.  The only complaint that I have here is that if the title of this product not led me to believe I was getting 9 pouches, I would of never purchased this item at such a high price.

review/summary: Not what's advertised
review/text: I ordered this expecting it to be the sweet, salty, and savory combination that everyone knows and loves as kettle corn.  Unfortunately, the actual product was far from that.  We use a whirly pop exclusively to pop our popcorn for the family, and figured we would give this product a try.  It was a horrible result that was like a gooey version of cracker jacks, without the sweet savory flavor.  What a total waste!

review/summary: shoppinL says worth the money
review/text: Yes, it is more expensive than other  brands. Worth it? Yes! It is The best Kettle corn we have tried. FAR superior to Any microwave brand or even the "carnival" bag that they say is "fresh". If you have a Whirly Pop, or something similar, I would Highly recommend this popcorn!

review/summary: Great product; expensive shipping
review/text: I sure wish Amazon would make this item part of their add on/free shipping program. The product itself is a great price, but the shipping charges are a killer. Last time I ordered these (directly from Parthenon Foods) I bought 20 to cut down on the shipping fee per item, but it was still pretty atrocious.<br />On to the item itself: If you have a candy recipe that calls for date paste and you don't want a gummy mess in your blender or food processor, this is the way to go.  Heating it up (after removing it from the package) for about 30 seconds in the microwave makes it really soft and easy to handle.
