review/summary: This is Just OK.
review/text: I drink de-caf only. I like a stonger decaf, like Coffee Peoples Decaf Donut Shop Blend, Extra Bold...  I usually like TImothys Decaf Columbian, so when I saw that Timothys had a decaf hazelnut, I figured I would try it.<br /><br />Its ok. the flavor is not bold. keep in mind, I have a Keurig mini, so there is only 1 cup size as an option, and thats the smallest size there is, and even using the smallest cup size, this coffee is weak by the time you add milk or creamer.<br /><br />The good thing is, its not bitter..  but, I can only imagine how weak this would taste if you set your Keurig for any size other than the smallest-- I bet the coffee would be undrinkable.<br /><br />As for the hazelnut flavor itself, its ok, as well..  Definitely not too strong, and the hazelnut flavot itself leans a *bit* toward the weak side. if you want more hazelnut flavor, I would say add hazelnut creamer.<br /><br />Again, overall, its just ok. I have 44 of these K-cups.. I will evenntually drink them, but it will take a long, long time... I dont hate it, although when I run out, I wont be buying this flavor again.

review/summary: Still searching for my lost cup of decaf java
review/text: I need to have a decaf coffee, and in this new, one-cup coffee-world I now embrace where regular coffee reigns in default, Timothy's hazelnut decaf rates an okay.  I would like to have the coffee stronger, for it is a bit thin and watery.  Yet I've surrendered and have gotten used to it, would buy it again, and find I need less cream or calories.  So this is a plus.  But overall I am still searching for my great cup of decaf.

review/text: I have been a K-coffee user for some time and I especially like Timothy's. I ordered this flavored coffee and the regular decaf at a very good price with the Amazon 1-day sale.  All the K-cup varieties are good and your K-pot makes a fresh cup in 30 sec.  Amazon delivered the coffee in just a couple of days and I'm still enjoying it.  Thanks, Amazon and Keurig.  When are you going to have another sale?  I don't hesitate to purchase at the regular price because I really enjoy the coffee, but sales allow us buy more!

I often drink it in the late afternoon/early evening, when I am craving a cup of coffee but do not want to be up all night long. It tastes just as good as it smells while brewing, and is great hot or iced.

review/text: I liked the flavor of this coffee, but it seemed to clog up my Keurig coffee maker about 25 percent of the time; this meant that I had to waste fifty cents about once every other day.  I'm not sure if this happened because it is decaf coffee, but I've never had a problem with any of the other brands and I clean my coffee maker out regularly.  I do not recommend buying the decaf version until the Timothy brand has figured this problem out.  Money wasted for sure!

I'm sure that could change at any time but for now if you can find it for under 50 cents a cup it's worth the purchase. I haven't tried the Van Houtte but like anything else you get what tastes best for you and then complain it's too expensive.

The hazelnut flavor doesn't overwhelm, but stands up to milk or cream and certainly works without either. This, BTW, is the first hazelnut decaf to fool the non-decaf drinkers in our house, so it must be as good as I think it is.

review/text: I love the taste of this product.  However, in a standard 24 count pack, you can expect to lose 3 cups due to the fact that the quality of the internal filter fails.  Your coffee mug will be full of coffee grounds.  I thought my machine was faulty at first until I opened up the k-cup to find that the filter had collapsed from the walls and caused the grounds to go all over the place.  I've decided to move on to another brand.

I love the aroma and even after adding half and half it maintains the delightfull hazelnut scent. I also like it because it is not overly strong or weak. I plan on getting the monthly subscription. The price is right and you can't beat the convenience of having it delivered to your home. I was spending over $50 a month and that was just for 1 large cup of Hazelnut coffee 5 times a week. Now it will cost me less than $26.

Its pleasant, nutty flavored edge is a bonus, and those who enjoy flavored coffees will love this one.  It is the perfect decaf to serve after a lovely dinner or first thing in the morning.

review/summary: not a strong coffee, but good flavor all around
review/text: I have to drink decaf coffee right now because I'm undergoing chemo, so I'm always on the hunt for decaf K-cups, especially flavored ones (no choco flavor, please--blegh!). I ordered these and put them on subscribe and save to reap even more discount benefits.<br /><br />My usual coffee tastes run to medium strength coffees, not bold ones or too-mild versions that look more like tea when done brewing. I usually make the largest size cup of coffee my Keurig will make, and these hazelnut K-cups are a little mild when done that way. However, they're excellent with the medium-sized cup option, and I really get a stronger hazelnut flavor that way.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavor is not overpowering regardless of cup size, and it blends nicely with the usual coffee flavors to create a cup that is fragrant and tasty without being overwhelming. I sweeten mine with agave nectar and add a little organic milk to the cup, and the combo is delicious.<br /><br />I do recommend this coffee for anyone who doesn't want a bold cuppa.

review/text: The product is probably fine, but I failed to note that it was DECAF.  I got excited about the price and flavor (my wife's favorite) and failed to notice the DECAF.  Unfortunately I am now stuck with several unopened boxes I can't return due to the return policy that would not exist if I just paid regular price in a store.  No problem with the coffee (my wife loves the regular), just be careful as you can't correct for quick reads.

review/summary: Finally used this product, and I like it
review/text: I bought this for my daughter, thinking she might want some cereal as a change of pace in her school lunches. Didn't happen, so the item sat in my kitchen cabinet for several months. I had to get a lunch together for myself in about two minutes' time last week, and I thought of this product. It holds just the right amount of cereal and milk, and the milk stayed cold. I took it to a "working lunch" with my ladies' organization, and quite a few of the ladies said they wanted one, too. My only advice is to be very careful when taking the top off of the cereal compartment, because the cereal could go flying if you're not careful with the snap-on lid. If it had been made with a screw top, I would have given it five stars.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this, and that my daughter didn't want it.

The meat is rather dry but easy to chew and the barbecue sauce is somewhat moist. A one-ounce serving is only 92 calories and has 8 grams of protein.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Someone previously complained about receiving the 24 oz Monster Assaults in a dome twist off lid. This is the only way they come if im not mistaken(for this size). This is also the BEST thing about it. The carbonation last hours longer and you avoid spilling the precious energy giving liquid inside. It's nice to come back to my drink an hour later in the fridge at work and have it still taste new. Lastly for purpose of post this is the best tasting energy drink there is in my opinion. It's almost always sold out around here which truly sucks but is so indicative of the qaulity.

review/text: I got this for my elderly cat with chronic renal failure (and diabetes). It has low phosphorus and sodium levels which is good for CRF cats. She's 16 and ill but still has her outstanding appetite, and she gobbled this up like it was ambrosia. I always add extra water to her food and make it soupy to increase her fluid intake, and this food is well blended and adding water is easy. It's a high-quality pet food and evidently highly palatable. It's far better smelling and looking (obviously I didn't taste it) than other CRF-friendly foods. If your cat has that condition and refuses prescription food or is finicky, give this a try.

review/text: I use horseradish to clear my sinuses.  The hotter it is, the better of a job it does.<br /><br />I saw Atomic horseradish on Modern Marvels, so I had to try it.  It is the hottest horseradish I have had.<br /><br />That is not to say that it is hotter than what you normal horseradish, but it is as hot as I have ever seen.<br /><br />From Modern Marvels, I learned that the heat of horseradish comes from the fineness of the grind, and the length of time it goes before they put vinegar in it.  According to Atomic, they use the finest grind and leave it longer than anyone else.<br /><br />When I first ate a spoonful of Atomic, my girlfriend thought I was about to faint.  It was the most intense heat I have ever experienced, and it left me not wanting to breath.  My sinuses were instantly cleared.  I now use a level teaspoon instead of a heaping teaspoon, to great effect.<br /><br />I'm sold!

The waiter or waitress would give me "to go" cups of it to take home, because it was only available through their wholesale distributor in gallon containers.  Yea! I am so glad I can get it through Amazon.  One important thing to keep in mind, is to put it into the refrigerator right away.<br /><br />I use it in most everything from cocktail sauces, deviled eggs, grilled cheese sandwiches to Sunday pot roast.

review/summary: Good value - Our Labrador pup loves likes them
review/text: These pork chomps mini knotz are of very good value. For the 21 count, I purchased it for $10. Other products with similar size and weight was in the $20 range.<br /><br />Our Labrador pup likes these bones and definitely keeps her occupied. Give it as a treat or hide it, either way it keeps them busy.<br /><br />The knotz are about 2 - 3 inches in length and about half an inch wide. The size varies, but that's the rough size of the bones.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with the product. If my dog could, she would say so too.

review/summary: little treats for little dogs
review/text: I have 2 small chiwienees who love these.  I've tried many different kinds for them and this is their favorite.  Seems to be a consistent product that has never made them sick.  They love them, and I'm glad there's no mess left behind.  Not greasy, and nothing remains when they are done with them.

review/summary: Very angry
review/text: I know exactly how delicious this product can be and so, because both my boyfriend and I love soft licorice, I ordered some via an Amazon seller. When it arrived, we tore it open. I had raised his expectations of this yummy Aussie / N.Z. treat. It was a big let down. The sell by date on the pack was about 6 months before it was sold; it was hard, not soft and faded/pale in color - so stale. I complained to the seller and got a refund, but kiddos, I would never buy this way again. Get it in person where you can squeeze the product and look at the sell by date! The product when fresh is incredibly yummy. Settle for nothing less than fresh, fresh, fresh.

review/text: Another great tea by Stash!  This is a nice smooth mint flavor.  It has the smoothness of a bergamont black tea, yet is a green tea.  It is 100% natural green tea with peppermint, lime flavor, and Japanese matcha.  It is so soothing.<br /><br />Like all Stash teas, each bag comes in its own individually sealed foil pouch to maintain its freshness.  I used only 1 bag per 24 oz hot water.  It would also make a refreshing ice tea.  I suggest natural sweeteners to preserve the benefits of the green tea.  Try agave cactus nectar (natural food isle of grocery store), honey, or natural unbleached sugar (next to reguar sugar in food isle).

review/text: howdy y'all,<br /><br />bought these for a few friends and tried them myself. i was hoping for that raspberry zing that i remember from picking them and eating them fresh. not quite. [*sigh ...*]<br /><br />the flavor is there, the tang is there ... but not very strong. not anywhere near the same degree as the fresh ones. the freeze dried banana and freeze dried strawberry items from these folks are noticeably more flavorful.<br /><br />i'm tempted to drop a star ... but not quite ready to do so.<br /><br />rated a THREE since it is [mostly] as expected with nothing special about it.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee

review/summary: Ten stars!
review/text: This is one of my very rare ten star products, ones I would give a full ten stars to if I could.  Why? Read on.<br /><br />It is delicious, especially with a bit of butter put on when you serve it.<br />It is enough for two generous servings.<br />It only takes 90 seconds in the microwave and cooks right in the bag.<br />Put the bag in the microwave for 90 seconds and you have a delicious side dish of rice pilaf.<br />Very little filler is added.<br />It has a very good flavor.  It IS salty, but I didn't find the saltiness to be too much, and I am someone who really dislikes salt.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is watching their sodium intake however.<br /><br />I plan to stock up on this and serve it once a week when I need a very easy and delicious side dish.  You could add your own cooked peas and carrots and celery to this also if you wanted to.<br /><br />Yummy and easy.

review/summary: An average energy bar
review/text: It is unclear from the way this is listed exactly what they are selling.  For 12 bars, the "list price" is outrageous, and the Amazon savings are suspect.  For 12 bars the Amazon price is high, as supermarkets sell these for under $2 each (a recent sale has been at $1 each).<br /><br />These are an average energy bar.  They come in a variety of flavors.  The flavors are OK, but not exceptional.  The sugar content is somewhat high.  The values given for protein and fiber content are lower than some other bars on the market, for example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ZZFPO">Clif Bar Energy Bar Chocolate Chip 12 Bars</a> which are available from Amazon at a lower price.  The bar actually left me somewhat hungry.<br /><br />So, it is an OK bar, but you can shop around and find better bars at a lower price.

review/summary: My favorite chocolates....except they are melted when I got it
review/text: I love chocolate filled with liquor and the Mon Cheri itself does not disappoint. It is the seller and the problematic packaging that gives me the urge to rate it 2 stars. Yes it wasn't FULLY melted when I got them, but the whole thing looks like its been stored somewhere in the desert in Nevada for three days before shipped to me. Yes it came with an ice pack that was supposed to keep it cool, except that the ice pack itself is like a balloon filled with warm water.<br /><br />So apparently, I will not buy from this seller again.

review/summary: Heavenly cherry goodness
review/text: If you like chocolate and refined liqueurs (together), you have to try these. For some reason  Americans are not that into liquor chocolates, but I just love them. My husband will maybe have one every other month, while I devour a whole box. :P The thing that bugs me the most is the trouble you go through to find these kind of treats in the US. Thank goodness for Amazon. I just love these chocolates. It's the right kind of balance between sweet cherry liqueur and dark chocolate. And the cherry in the middle is absolutely divine. This is a guilty pleasure you shouldn't deny yourself.

review/text: I tried these when I was in Italy. I loved them so much I purchased all of them that I could find from the airport. Which was only like 5 boxes of 5. When I went home the product was stale so I had to have them again. Went on amazon and found them. Purchased them and have been in love every since.<br /><br />The quality of the product is always fresh and great, they come perfect with no issues. If you like dark chocolate with a cherry inside filled with a whiskey liquor this is great. It's like a mini shot when you bite into it. I enjoy giving one to my friends and just telling them to eat the entire thing all at once and see their response!

review/summary: These pack a punch!
review/text: My husband purchased these for me as a gift. He did not realize that there was more than one kind of candy by the same name. The other candies look the same, but are filled with a truffle-like filling with hazelnuts. These are great if you like chocolate covered cherries. However, be prepared for a kick in the pants. These are definitly not your oridnary chocalate covered cherries. They have a very potent alchaholic punch to them, if you don't mind that I suggest trying them.

review/text: This makes an amazingly delicious red curry! I add 1 packet of paste, 2 cans coconut milk (the real stuff, with the fat), 2 Tablespoons fish sauce, 3 chicken breast, 1 red pepper, 1 can of pineapple, 1 small can of bamboo shoots, and 1/4 cup sugar. Chop and simmer it all for about 30 minutes, and serve over rice. It has just the right amount of heat, and tastes like something you would get from an authentic Thai restaurant. Of course, you can use whatever veggies you have on hand, these are just my favorites. I make a large pot, and freeze it in individual containers for a super-fast meal. Taste of Thai Red Curry Paste, I don't know what I would do without you!! (Actually I do, and my Thai take-out bills would be outrageous!)
