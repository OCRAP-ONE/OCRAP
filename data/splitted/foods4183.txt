review/summary: Doesn't get much better
review/text: I was pet sitting recently and the dog I was sitting for had these in her treat pouch. She loved them so I tried them with my dogs. All 3 dogs were quite well-behaved whenever they saw me reach for these goodies. My son and I jokingly call them "doggie crack". They're good for them, they work as training tools, what else can you ask for in a dog treat?

review/text: My beagle/lab mix is fairly picky with treats, but she goes nuts for these. I've been trying to find something other than chicken jerky from China (after reading reports from the FDA showing illness/death in dogs) that my dog really loves, and these seem to fit the bill nicely.

review/text: My three month old Westie loves this treat. The only bad thing is that it's huge for training. If I command sit, it takes him 20 seconds to finish eating it and do the next trick. I recommend breaking it into tiny pieces because the label says 1 or 2 a day only. My pup loves this treat and would do anything for it!

review/text: I know some people have suggested this product is not for training, and I couldn't disagree more. I have en English Bulldog who is solely motivated by these. I was able to teach her voice commands in a very short time with these liver treats as rewards. While the peices could be a bit smaller (I often cut them up a bit) these are very healthy treats. I love them and my bulldog loves them!

review/text: PRO:<br />-my dogs (maltese and poodle mix) go crazy over these treats. they are very obedient once they know that i'm holding these treats in my hand<br />-since they're freeze dried, i don't have to worry about these treats drying out<br />-although it comes in big cubes, i'm able to cut the cubes into smaller pieces with a plastic knife in order to lengthen the usage out of my stash of these dog treats<br />-my containers always came with very little crumbs/powder at the container's bottom<br /><br />CON:<br />-not uniform sizes<br />-not cheap<br /><br />Conclusion: still a great product, but need some modifications<br />*Since every morsel appears to be so flavorful, all my dogs need is a pinkie nail size amount to reward them.<br />*It may SEEM like the crumbs/powder is useless, but actually, it is still somewhat useful. I used the powder to coat bland chewy dog treats, dog food, toys, etc.

review/summary: Love these... or at least my dog does.
review/text: These are a great deal when compared to the small bags of treats available at the pet store. More importantly, my dog adores them. I use them as an extra special treat, usually just for when he goes into his crate. As soon as he notices that I have one in my hand, he runs to his crate and waits, tail wagging. The only downside is that the liver cubes smell horrible (to humans, anyway) and leave a powdery residue behind. But as some other reviews have noted, the powder is great for sprinkling on dry food for a finicky dog.

review/summary: Great treat, but probably not for small dogs
review/text: These treats are similar to the PureBites, however, since I have small dogs (Peke mix), I generally don't give them these snacks because they are more suited for medium and large dogs (or small dogs with large mouths). Smaller dogs have a hard time biting down on them and there is the possibility of choking because the pieces are too large and dense for their small mouths, so I have to break them up into smaller pieces before I give them to my doggies. The PureBites, on the other hand, are flatter and easier for them to chew. The snacks appear to made in the same way, so if I had larger dogs, I would give them either this snack or the PureBites.

review/text: Our two dogs love this product, and we love the fact that it's not loaded with chemical preservatives and fillers.  The fact that the pieces are irregular is not a drawback and is not surprising.  I do cut up the larger pieces as I don't want to give them too much at once.  The prospect of getting one of these treats makes them much more receptive to training and just coming when you call.  Also, we find the largest size very economical as you don't pay for shipping.

review/summary: Great treat!
review/text: My 2 year old German Shepherd loves this treat.  I keep it on my counter as a quick and handy treat for "mini, spontaneous training sessions".  The only issue I have is that most of the treats are a bit big and difficult to break into smaller pieces which is necessary for obedience classes where we go through many treats.  Therefore, I do not use these treats for that purpose.  (The container recommends only 3-4 cubes per day for large dogs).  Having said that, they are an excellent treat for occasional use and I would highly recommend them.

review/summary: My dog would do anything for this treat
review/text: By far this treat is the best one that I have bought.  We used it to crate train out puppy and whenever he saw us going for the bucket or smelled it being opened he would run for his crate and sit in there until we gave him this treat.  The large bucket is the most economicay, but it does have a really strong odor when you open it; for that reason we always keep a small ziploc with the treats in it that we use regularly and only open the bin to refill that bag.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the sizes of the treats varies incredibly - but if one is too large we just split it, we will give 2 of the small ones, and the powder and bits at the end just go in his dinner one night for an added treat!

The most recent order arrived in a flash.<br /><br />I hope California (where M5 is based) won't ruin this vendor's affiliate status. Trying to solve the state pension problem on the backs of Amazon affiliates is like trying to move a beached blue whale by kicking it.

I am also a fan of sushi rolls, seafood (in my fairly recent past life as an omnivore), and weird foods in general. However, I found this to be one of the most unappealing things I've ever encountered. I was hoping to find a new healthy snack -- maybe something like kale chips? Nope. It's just extremely thin sheets of seaweed. It looks like cellophane and tastes  like the bottom of the ocean. I could not discern any chipotle flavoring, and after two bites, the entire pack was in the trashcan. In the future, I will just pay for overpriced kale chips because at least I enjoy eating them!

review/text: If you want something different and healthier, and enjoy the flavors of nori and other seafoods, give these a try! The spice is a bit hotter than I thought but the flavor of the nori still shines through. They are light and crispy and could be your new favorite snack. I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors they have. The texture is actually a bit lighter than some other nori sheets that I've tried and they are easier to break apart and snack on than nori intended for rolling.<br /><br />To everyone posting negative reviews claiming these "taste like the bottom of the ocean" - stop kidding yourself - they are not potato chips. If you want a potato chip go and buy a potato chip. They are seaweed after all and the product name "Seasnax" seems to be clear enough to me that they are not masquerading as anything else.

review/text: I have eaten these little gems for more years than I care to admit.  But about a year ago I decided I needed to lose some weight and I began to cut out both sugar and fat items.  However, to be successful in the long term on this you shouldn't deny yourself everything and the one treat I kept was these bite-sized Mary Janes.  They're only about thirty calories each and give your taste buds a long, satisfying chew that makes you think you've eaten an entire candy bar.  I lost the weight I wanted to lose and these guys helped.  If you enjoy the rich taste of peanut butter and molasses then you should give them a try whether you're attempting to lose weight or just want something delicious to enjoy eating.  And very importantly, you'll save money buying them in bulk via an Amazon vendor.

review/summary: good for kittens
review/text: I have been fostering kittens for a few years now and I think that this is a great food to start out on if you have a tighter budget. I really like the holistic foods, but I think that starting out with this is not too bad. It's not as great for you kitten, but it provides all their necessities and it's not too bad of a brand. It still contains some corn and that is not that great food your pet, but i think that this is probably better than the other science diet formulas. I just wanted to note that the higher quality food that you feed your kitten, the less waste they will produce and the general health will increase (shinier coat and etc). I always get this is the big bag because it seems to be the most worth it and this food is not too bad when you can get it on sale. You can also buy these from your local petsmarts so I think it is pretty convenient. Remember to get your pets spayed and neutered as well!! prevent the over accumulation of strays in our shelters and stop overpopulation!!!

review/summary: It's lemon, with a little mint!
review/text: I ordered this assuming it would taste like soda water flavored with mint.  Wrong!  It has  heavy lemon flavor with mint overtones.  I don't like lemon with mint, so if you like lemon laced with mint this is for you!  I'm not happy with this at all.  It contains lemon juice concentrate as a major ingredient, they don't advertise that fact! Also, the mint is not spearmint, it's more of a mix of mint brewed into an extract.  The result is not the pleasant flavor I was hoping to find.  I suggest this product would be great if it were soda water infused with spearmint, but I suppose that wouldn't make everyone happy.

review/summary: Not for everyone, but great if it's your type of drink!
review/text: If you really hate that "seltzer water" taste, then this isn't for you. The flavoring isn't too strong and you can tell you're drinking carbonated water. For me, though, I like the taste generally and I love the lemon-mint flavor. They're not cheap, but these sorts of sodas never are.<br /><br />If you want something with 0 calories and no artificial sweeteners that's crisp and tasty, then try this out! It's a guilt-free drink for when you want a soda.<br /><br />However, if you don't like something that isn't sweetened (sugar and artificial sweeteners typically hide the carbonated water taste) then this isn't for you.

review/summary: If you like crystallized ginger
review/text: This was my third time ordering this product.  I really enjoyed the first 2 cases of the cookies last year, but this batch was not as flavorful and had a dryer, harder texture.  At first, I thought my memory of how good they were was just faulty, but my daughter told me she felt the others had been much better, too.  I contacted Pamela's Products about the problem, and after some discussion, they sent me replacement cookies.  These cookies made me fall in love with this product all over again - they had an enjoyable texture and those lovely little taste treats of crystallized ginger pieces that leave the mouth tingling for awhile after the cookie is gone.  I am glad I persevered, as these are exceptional for "store-bought" cookies!

review/summary: Gluten Free Ginger Cookie!
review/text: If you like your ginger cookies chewy and really spicy, then this is the cookie for you - even if you aren't on a restrictive diet! Among the many flavors of Pamela's cookies, it's the one that comes closest to "legal" for me because, besides being 70% organic and  gluten-free, it's nut-, chocolate-, and dairy-free as well. It certainly has 5-star taste, but I didn't award it 5 stars because the indgredients do include eggs and processed sugars.<br /><br />Check out the whole Pamela line, reading the ingredient lists carefully, to see what might work for you. The only ones I've tasted that I wouldn't recommend are the Lemon Shortbread. They have that "rice & tapioca flour" taste and texture, and don't even really fill a craving for something sweet.

review/text: I love ginger and these are probably the best cookies out there for my taste (gluten-free or otherwise).

review/text: These taste like a really good, spicy molasses cookie.  They remind me of the Grandma's Molasses (tm) cookies that you buy in the single serving packs, only a little spicier and a bit softer.  The texture is good, not at all gritty like with some gluten free products, and the spice really plays up the ginger flavor.  Great for that afternoon tea or coffee break.  I will definitely buy these again and would recommend these to a friend.

review/summary: My name is Maureen and I'm addicted to these cookies
review/text: Amendment: I no longer eat these cookies because they are almost always rock-hard stale (at least the ones I get through Amazon).  I'm leaving the stars and review as is because when you can get these cookies fresh, they are delicious.<br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />I'm not kidding.  I can't stay away from them.  What I think is best about these cookies is that they have a true ginger flavor, kind of like gourmet ginger snaps.  The bits of crystalized ginger on top are like getting a small reward.  The cookies themselves are moist, but firm (not crisp!), not sticky like some GF cookies I've tried.  I've read this comment sometimes about GF baked goods: it has good mouth feel.  So do these cookies.<br /><br />The other thing I like about the Pamela line of cookies is the size of each cookie. Not too big, not too small, but as Goldilocks would say: just right.  Even if I weren't obliged to live GF, I would buy these cookies.

review/summary: Gluten free, yet very tasty
review/text: I am very pleased with these cookies. They are soft and chewy, which is how I like my cookies. And they are very tasty. If you have to eat gluten free, you know the challenge is to find ready made products that are not outright bad, or something you would only eat because you have no choice. Granted, they cost more than normal packaged cookies, as gluten free products usually do, but price aside, I can say I would eat these even if I did not have celiac.<br /><br />When buying from Amazon you have to buy more at a time than you would if going to an actual store, and sometimes expiration dates can be an issue. When I received these they had an expiration date good for 6 months, so I was happy with that. I think they will be gone in 2 weeks, but it is nice to know they are not near their expiration.

review/summary: Pamela's Spicy Ginger Cookies
review/text: I love gingerbread and ginger cookies, and Pamela's Spicy Ginger Cookies are the best tasting ginger cookies I've found. When they are fresh they have a nice chewy texture and just the right bite of crystallized ginger. I spread them with peanut butter for a fast breakfast or quick snack: the flavors meld perfectly. My only quibble: they are rather pricey, and if they are not at their peak of freshness, they get hard, dry and brittle, though you can revive them somewhat by dunking them in milk or tea. In the store, you can tell the state of freshness by lightly pressing your thumb on the sample cookie through the cellophane. The cookie will yield slightly if it is fresh. If it doesn't yield at all, the cookies are stale: don't buy the box. I would give these cookies 5 stars if they were always sold fresh.

review/text: 20 years ago, my mother-in-law introduced me to Cavender's seasoning.  Since then, my kitchen has always been equipped with it.  We sprinkle a little on eggs, and use it as part of olive oil marinade for steaks. It also comes unsalted, if that is what you prefer.  To me this is as important as having salt and pepper handy when cooking.  So to make sure I never run out of it, I buy it by the 5-LB jug!

Just a warning - the regular (red shaker/bucket) is salted.  Do not add additional salt to your recipe.  If you don't want the salt, buy the blue shaker - it has no salt at all.

(Or any steak for that matter, we just use ribeyes)  Season it with garlic powder, (not salt) freshly ground pepper, teriyaki sauce and Cavender's.  Rub this into the meat and let it sit for awhile...the longer the better. (We have let them sit for as little as 15 mins and as long as 12 hrs; both still good.)  Then, grill to your heart's content.  Trust me on this.  You will make these for someone and they will want the recipe.  Oh, and better make two steaks; one for you and one for the neighbors because they will just show up when they smell em cooking!  Let me know how you like em!

review/summary: Outstanding All-Purpose Seasoning
review/text: As others have intimated, this salt-based spice mix is amazingly versatile and tasty.  I first tasted this product about 25 years ago on some hamburgers that my grandmother grilled out on the patio.  I have been hooked ever since.  I used to be able to find this occasionally on my local grocery store shelves, but it just became more and more scarce over the years.  I went to the manufacturers website only to find an option to mail order........what?  Sorry, but that's just not going to happen.  I was excited to find it on Amazon a while back, but it was only available from one vendor.....and they never seemed to have any in stock.  When I found the 12-pack of 8oz shakers, I immediately purchased it and gave some to my friends and family.<br /><br />How does my family use it?  Well, we love it on fried eggs....yes it's great in scrambled....but I prefer the kick it gives the fried ones.  I use it as a seasoning on all types and cuts of meat before I bake, broil, or grill.  Use it on large cuts of pork or pork tenderloin, lamb, excellent on all beef cuts like steaks and burgers, works ok on chicken breasts, but you can't be quite as liberal due to the leanness of the cut.  The more fat on/in the food, the more seasoning you can use....like most seasonings.  I've used it as a rub on chicken thighs that I barbecued and it was amazing.  We enjoy it in homemade mac and cheese as well.  I enjoy a shake or two on salads and tuna sandwiches.<br />Though the package size may be too big if you just want to try some for the first time, you can always share.  Besides, if you came to Amazon looking for seasonings anyway, there's a good chance you'll fall in love with this stuff and need a dozen yourself........you know......so you have a stash at all times.

review/summary: I give Cavender"s All Purpose Greek Seasoning " 5 stars"!
review/text: My daughter introduced me to Greek seasoning about 8 yrs. ago.  I have stopped using a salt shaker and only use greek seasoning. It helps limit the amount of salt I use. I only used salt on corn-on-the-cob, fresh tomatoes, and salted everything before I tasted it. Using Greek Seasoning helps me limit salt use and my blood pressure , with the help of medicine, has dropped to the normal range. I love the taste of the perfect blend of different spices. I have used other blends and have found Cavender's to be the best tasting blend for me. I purchased this product through Amazon.com and am very happy with the service and promptness with which it was delivered.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H26JEW">Cavender's All Purpose Greek Seasoning, 8-Ounce Shakers (Pack of 12)</a>

review/text: Used Cavendars for many years and then for a couple years could not find it in the stores.  My son ran across it at Bi-Lo - SC and picked me up 3 cans.  It is the best BEST seasoning unless you want to pay $100 plus for seasoning.  Works on everything, anything.  Egg and cheese sandwich, tuna salad, steaks (OOH), chicken.  It just can't be beat for the normal to upper scale home kitchen.  (I have left reviews on the web - maybe 5 times in 12 years.)

review/summary: My son-in-law loves this!
review/text: My son-in-law spent time in Greece when he was in the Air Force. His mother, who cooks wonderful New Orleans food, brought that young man up cooking like a pro.  When he was in Greece, he fell in love with tasty Greek dishes made with lamb and chicken.  Now when he cooks that wonderful food for my daughter and the rest of us serious eaters, he seasons it with Cavender's All Purpose Greek Seasoning.  That little yellow shaker is all he needs to make his food taste the way he remembered dishes tasted in Greece.<br /><br />It is necessary to remember that this seasoning mixture is a food rich in sodium.

review/summary: Throw away your Salt & Pepper
review/text: Ever wish you knew the secrets of a great steakhouse restaurant? This is it. It's good as we've all said here.<br /><br />This is our favorite way to use it:<br />Place 4 thin boneless chicken cutlets in a flat bowl. Add the zest of half a lemon to 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil. Pour over chicken, turning to coat both sides with lemon oil mixture. Sprinkle both sides with Cavender's Greek Seasoning - (we like a generous amount, but you should experiment with the amount until you find what you like).<br />Heat an outdoor grill or an indoor grill pan with ridges on med-high heat. When hot & almost smoking, add chicken to pan. Don't move the chicken for 3-4 minutes, then turn and cook on the other side for 3-4 minutes more, or until juices run clear. Remove to a clean platter and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let chicken rest for 5 minutes. Chicken will continue to cook while resting. Slice and serve over salad or on a roll with lettuce & tomato. Opa!<br />PS: You can also mix Cavender's with garlic powder to make an incredible garlic bread!

review/text: I am NOT a company spokesperson, but a new drinker of this tea and brand.  At first I was hesitant to buy this due to the one comment left stating you need two bags.  Glad I didn't listen, because as long as you steep it the 3-5 minutes suggested, one bag is more than adequate.  I got this for the health properties it may provide and so far have noticed it really does give you a nice, natural mood lift AND I was pleasantly surprised that I actually enjoy the taste.  Am not a big tea drinker, but I'd drink this even if it didn't help me.  This came packaged great, quickly and professionally.  I'll be back for more of this.

review/summary: Windsor is the way to go
review/text: I regularly travel to Bolivia and drink this tea, it's the miracle tea it helps with; digestive problems, prevents altitude syndrome, vertigo, vomit, it takes away feeling of hunger, helps regulate your metabolism etc... I was very excited to find it on amazon.The main reason I drink it is it's 100% natural and 100% caffeine free (I'm one of those people who can't tolerate caffeine but need something to get the energy going). This vendor is authentic as the packaging is from Windsor ( a known coca tea distributor), as soon as you open the wrapping you can immediately smell the fresh coca leaves. I've been ordering from Andean Organic Products for about  5 months now and satisfied every time, plus it ships immediately. Great product + Great Seller double win.

review/summary: Excellent for toothaches!
review/text: I have genetically horrible teeth (thanks mom!) and as of recently, save for the details, I have a lot of dental pain from cavities and such.  I'm getting it addressed by an oral surgeon, and in total it's all costing me over $12,000 out of pocket (no insurance).  Needless to say, I'm in a ton of pain from the cavities, my teeth are THROBBING, sometimes all day.  I scoured the internet for temporary remedies, and read that coca mate can numb the mouth in a similar fashion to novocaine, the same stuff they use at the dentist!  So, I gave it a try, and whaddaya know, it works!!!  It numbed up my gums and took a great deal of the edge off.  Previously I was unable to focus at work, left early a few days, can't sleep, can't eat because of the pain.  Well, thanks to this tea, I can now get through these difficult days while I am between oral surgeries.  I have to use a few bags at a time for a strong enough effect to help with the pain, but it's comforting to know that I found a natural, safe, inexpensive aid that acts fast!  :)

review/summary: Very fresh but only 0.80 to 0.90 grams per package
review/text: The leaves without the bags weigh 0.80 to 0.90 grams.  With the bags, 1.0 grams.  The crushed leaves were perfectly green and dry.  In chewing one bag with gum like a guide in Cuzco instructed me, my tongue and roof of mouth were a little bit numb (like a pinch of benzocaine oral gel), showing it has the expected ingredients. After leaving in boiling water a minute and pressing really well, the used leaves do not cause my tongue to get numb, so boiling as tea must be working correctly.  It requires higher temps for a longer time than other teas, or I can still sense some numbing from chewing on the used leaves. It definitely needs pressing with a spoon on the side of the cup while still very hot. Someone suggested crushing with baking soda but I found the taste to outweigh the any theoretical benefits.<br /><br />I had a cold today and 9 bags seem to be helping phenomenally.  My sinuses are now clear from all the hot fluids, at least. Not a jittery feeling like coffee (3 cups today) which did not seem to help nearly as much.  I am not bouncing off the walls or anything, just feeling nearly up to par.<br /><br />I estimated the effect of 1 bag chewed with gum to be about like 50 mg of benzocaine oral gel in terms of how numb they each make my mouth (50 mg is a small drop and is a little more than what you would use on a small mouth sore).  The oral gel is 20% benzocaine, so 50 mg provides 10 mg benzocaine equivalence in my estimate of the comparison.  Coca is supposed to be 0.5% alkaloids which gives 5 mg from a 1 gram bag, so if benzocaine has the same numbing effect per mg, then these bags contain at least as much alkaloids as they should.<br /><br />The effect is so identical I looked up benzocaine and learned the German discoverer traveled a lot and in 1890 wanted to mimic the pain relief of "concentrated coca" without the negative side effect of addiction (or at least habit forming). Benzocaine only works as a local anesthetic.  Benzocaine is being discouraged because at only 50 mg it can cause methemoglobinemia (blocking blood's ability to carry oxygen).  Some people have died.  This is ironic because they recommend coca for altitude sickness (lack of oxygen in the air), and coca does not cause methemoglobinemia unless it is in the form of a pharmaceutical with aniline.  Benzocaine is sometimes used to cut a certain common drug which has caused some people to get methemoglobinemia.

review/text: Well I guess it's pleasant enough. I had to use four or five bags to get any noticeable effect though and sometimes even that did not work when my start point was feeling a bit low.<br /><br />If I am feeling low I would most likely require around 8-10 bags to lift the mood a bit.<br /><br />But still it's not bad. Tastes pleasant enough. Has some interesting qualities to it.<br /><br />In terms of effects, maybe size has something to do with it. I'm quite a big guy but my natural weight is around 13 stones before you add on the fat.<br /><br />Not bad though as I say and probably worth having now and again just to loosen up.

review/text: This tea  tastes fine, but if you have to have regular drug testing, as do many in my profession and others, this tea will definitely give a postive for cocaine metabolites, which coca leaves produce.

My son and I like to eat oats straight from the bag without cooking, so I cannot say how they would have tasted had we cooked them.  I called the company for an explanation and was told that the bitterness was "normal" for gluten-free oats; however, I have used Bob's Red Mill gluten-free oats for quite some time and have never had a problem.  Besides that, all oats are initially gluten free; it's just in the processing of the oats that they can become cross-contaminated.  At any rate, I will just stick with Bob's from now on!

(Note: only 5 oz instead of 7 oz. box)<br /><br />Butter shortbread: Couldn't really eat these. Too heavy and buttery. Least favorite.<br /><br />Haven't tried others yet.<br /><br />I have a wheat allergy and never tasted shortbread again until I found these wonderful delights at the store in the health-food section! The shortbread choc chip I tried first has not only the unique taste of shortbread, but has chocolate chunks also! They are crunchy and light.<br /><br />In comparison, they weigh less than some other Pamela products. They are not as "buttery" as the Butter Shortbread or Swirl (a good thing in my opinion). I love the pecans also!<br /><br />Recommend to any wheat-allergy sufferer, or gluten intolerant person. :^)

review/text: My children and I all have to eat gluten-free.  I do most of our baking, but once in a while we splurge.  EVERY Pamela's product I have tried has been great!  These and espresso chunk are my indulgences.  The baking mixes are wonderful if you are in a hurry.  Please note: Pamela's does use other things that might be allergens, so please read the ingredient list! :)

review/summary: Too much aftertaste
review/text: We eat mostly gluten free as one of my kids has a sensitivity to it. While I try to bake all the goods myself, these looked like a good thing to carry as a snack when we travel. My daughter didn't like the cookie part much. SHe kept trying to pick out just the chocolate chips.<br /><br />For myself, it was OK. Sometimes gluten free baked goods can have a grainy aftertaste and that was the case with these. The upshot was they make an excellent cookie crumb pie crust when you toss them in the food processor and grind them up.
