review/summary: I overpaid! Go to international grocer . . . .
review/text: I purchased this product online because I'm learning how to make sushi and the organic part appealed to me. While I imagine it is a terrific product (I haven't received it yet), I found packages of 100 sheets of Nori seaweed (not organic) for about $2-5 at the local international grocery store. I can't remember the exact price, but it was very cheap and twice as many sheets.  I paid over $20 here on Amazon for this product, not including shipping. I live in Southern Illinois near a large college, so perhaps every place does not have an international grocery store, but I would check into it before purchasing the things you need to make sushi.  I found the books on making sushi cheaper on ebay, and the rice vinegar was one third of the price at my local Kroger grocery store.  I also found the hot chili sauce at Kroger for very little as well. The Japanese mayo (Kewpie) I found at the international grocery store as well for a fraction of the cheapest asking price on Amazon. While I love Amazon, and oftentimes find things cheaper here, I learned the hard way that I should have shopped around.

review/summary: Steaming Organic Lemon Pine Sol in a Cup
review/text: I'm of Asian descent, a serious tea drinker, and a big fan of anything citrus.  I wanted so badly to like this tea.  I bought a single box on sale from my local grocery store to try out first, as I didn't want to commit to a whole case from Amazon right away.  Boy, am I glad I did.  We try to choose organic whenever possible, but this tea has the overpowering aroma of lemon Pine Sol. My coworkers are laughing and concurring as we speak.  One down, seventeen tea bags left to go... Maybe I'll save it for the next time one of us comes down with a cold.

review/summary: Wonderful Combination of Yerba Mate and Green Tea
review/text: *****<br />Numi Tea Rainforest Green-Mate Lemon Myrtle Green Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are organic South American yerba mate blend, organic lemon myrtle, and fair trade certified Chun Mee Green Tea. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "For hundreds of years, Yerba Mate has long been a ceremonial drink of friendship, hospitality, strength, and courage to the people of the South American rainforest. This evergreen leaf is known for its pleasantly stimulating effect and for evoking a cheerful mental lucidity. We are proud to introduce this delightful tasting infusion of organic Mate with the Australian rainforests' organic Lemon Myrtle, touted as herb of the millennium for its high citral content. Organic Chun Mee green tea, skillfully hand-rolled into the eyebrow contour of its name, unfolds a subtle, plum-like sweetness to the leafy lemon piquancy of Mate and Myrtle. This energizing blend uplifts one's senses, as clarity arrives like birdsong after fresh rain." It's a nice combination of yerba mate and green tea, a terrific pick-me-up (it does contain some caffeine).<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but enjoy yerba mate and/or green tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Great flavor!
review/text: I have been buying this tea for years. I first tried it at my BFF's house and fell in love with the flavor. It is a tea that I enjoy year round, however, I love drinking it in the winter. It is also the tea I grab when my throat hurts; it is soothing and warms your body.<br /><br />Not only is the flavor great but the deal is too. I want to add although it states a 2 pack on the page, in two different areas at that; I received a 3 pack today. I figured it was 3 pack since most of Numi teas on Amazon are sold as the 3 pack.<br /><br />Added June 3, 2011: It was pointed out to me by the nice comment below that Amazon is only sending 2 boxes out. It is odd I received 3 and most of the other Numi teas are a pack of 3. I guess they need to either fix their inventory or the page. It does seem high for a box of 2 and not 3.

review/summary: Nothing
review/text: Now you may ask why pay to have H20 packed and shipped half way around the world just to be guzzled in a mater of seconds, minutes at the most?<br /><br />Well "nothing" is the reason. Everyday you hear about the odd stuff that is in local water supplies. My favorite statement is "it may look nasty and taste awful but it is perfectly safe." So we turn to bottled water that is everything from the same local water just packaged to fancy mineral water that needs lime to mellow it out. Included in this category is a concoction called drinking water; they take everything out and put back what they guess makes water drinkable. The worst sort of stuff is items packed in colorful plastic bottles that taste like colorful plastic.<br /><br />Evian on the other hand is water the way that nature intended. It goes down smooth and has no after taste. It is refreshing when cooled but can work well even at room temperature. Gourmet coffee locations use this as the base water because it does not distract from the taste. The water is even used externally for applying and removing makeup. I keep a case in the car incase of any emergency that may come up.<br /><br />There is "nothing" more satisfying.

review/summary: "Fresh" tasting water
review/text: The water we get on tap at work has a strange after-taste so I have been bringing bottled water with me to drink at work. I like Evian water taste (it feels 'fresh' to me) and often select it as the water I bring to work. I was not totally sure about the difference between different types of bottled water and wondered if it was just marketing.  Recently I came across a good explanation of different bottled water terms and I wanted to share the summary of the definitions here.<br /><br />Spring water derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the Earth's surface. Spring water must be collected at the spring or through a borehole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring. Evian and Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water.<br /><br />Artesian water is obtained from a well that taps a confined aquifer, an underground layer of rock or sand that contains water. Fiji Natural Artesian Water is one example of artesian water source.<br /><br />Distilled water is water that has been boiled and then recondensed from the steam that the boiling produces. The process of distillation kills microbes and removes minerals, however it tends to give it a flat taste. Glaceau Smartwater is distilled water.<br /><br />Mineral water is ground water that naturally contains a minimum of 250 parts per million of dissolved solids. "Naturally" means that the mineral were not added later,  it means all minerals must be present in the water when it emerges at the source. Calistoga is one example of mineral water.<br /><br />P.W.S. stands for Public water source (also often called municipal water supply or tap water). Aquafina is an example of water that came from a public supply.<br /><br />Purified water from any source that has been treated to remove chemicals and pathogens according to standards set by the U.S. Pharmacopoeia.  It must contain no more than 10 parts per million of dissolved solids. Distillation, de-ionization, and reverse osmosis are all purification methods. Aquafina and Dasani are examples of purified water.<br /><br />Sparkling water contains carbon dioxide at an amount equal to what it contained when it emerged from its source. Note that carbon dioxide lost during the treatment process may be added back. Perrier is an example of sparkling water.<br /><br />The terms "glacier water" and "mountain water" have no standard definition and thus it is not known exactly what is the original source of the water for the waters that use these terms to describe their product.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

So I went with the Fat Free, and honestly, the only difference I noticed between the regular and fat free was that the fat free is less sweet, which is a good thing in my book, as the regular is almost too sweet.<br />You don't need to add any sugar to your coffee or tea when you use this flavored Coffee Mate.<br />Love it!

review/summary: I am an Americolor convert!
review/text: When I learned to decorate cakes over 10 years ago, I learned using Wilton.  I love Wilton, I'm a big advocate for all things Wilton.  Until now.  I am officially an Americolor convert.  These colors are so amazingly vibrant!  And using them to make paint (with clear vanilla), to paint on fondant and gumpaste is a TREAT.  They are some much smoother and easier to use and the colors are so brilliant I doubt I will ever buy Wilton color again.  I still love many, many things Wilton - but for color I'm hooked on Americolor!

review/summary: Really, REALLY black!
review/text: I read the previous reviews of AmeriColor's Super Black icing coloring and decided to give it a try to make my daughter's zebra-striped birthday cake. I wanted a black that I could use without having to start with chocolate icing (birthday girl does not like chocolate!). It turned snow-white marshmallow fondant BLACK, with very little of the gel and no noticeable taste difference. I was afraid that the coloring would leave my hands purple or blue, but the only place I noticed a stain was where I touched the full-strength coloring directly--once I mixed it in with the melted marshmallow before mixing the powdered sugar in to make the fondant, there were not problems with stains. I can't say if it would stain stone counters, though--I was not brave enough to test it on my granite, and so I kneaded the fondant on wax paper. Like other reviewers, I was a Wilton fan for years, but love this new alternative and will definitely be using AmeriColor from now on.

review/text: I ordered this in anticipation of making my son an x-box cake for his 8th birthday.

My son was happy so even if I wouldn't eat the final product, I'd say it was a success.

I'll add to the review when we have actually used the product.<br /><br />I did want to mention, though, for those who think this might be a really great deal - the bottle<br />you see in the photo is NOT the bottle you are purchasing. You are getting one of the very small (under 3" tall)<br />drop bottles, not one of the large ones shown in the photograph. I wanted to point that out, because for people who<br />are only looking at the photos, it is misleading. Not sure why some sellers feel the need to be sneaky, but<br />I guess they try for more sales that way.<br /><br />I'll be back to review the actual gel once we are done with the project.<br />Just don't expect the big bottle when you purchase from this listing.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Well, I am now a HUGE fan of the gel coloring!<br />It worked like a dream, gave us a beautiful frosting that looked like black leather (but soft).<br />No purples or blues, no weird shades - just great color.<br />Now I will probably have to get more colors, because with these, I might start decorating cupcakes again!<br />I am adding a photo of our cookout cupcakes that we used the frosting for... it all looked great!

review/summary: Affordable, Great Discount w/Autoship & Free Ship!
review/text: Go to the Natural Value website and read about the Sacramento California company and you'll feel even more confident about the quality of their products and the company's beliefs, especially in fair trade. All the pet food cans are BPA-free now as well. I literally have offered every high-end quality wet or dry cat food available to my semi-feral cat, even raw. It doesn't matter how good it is for your pet if your pet won't eat it. My cat will eat every bit of this brand and flavor as well as the chicken/tuna combination. Her fur is glossy and her eyes bright. I particularly like that even after half of the can is refrigerated it stirs to a smooth consistency immediately and effortlessly. Few if any of the online pet suppliers offer free shipping except as a promotion with the price per can the highest they can mark-up.

review/text: No fancy ingredients, just salt, pepper and some spices - this is the best lemon pepper I ever tasted, and I tried lots of them. I've been using if for several years, sometimes a new batch is a little coarser, but it's always very good. The salt content is just right for me. I don't use a lot of salt, but I do like some. Try it on avocado on whole wheat - delicious!

review/text: Good product! Very convenient. Making tart shells by hand is a truly miserable experience, so finding a good quality, big quantity, pre-made tart shell really speeds things along. Why 4 stars? Although they were in trays, the packing they arrived in was too open/big and not padded well, many shells fell out and there was more breakage than there should have been. Careless packing - that's all.

review/text: In my first shipment, two of three bags were completely broken and therefore the salt was rattling around in the box.  This left me with one bag.  When I contacted customer service they sent me another three.  This time all three had dime size holes in the top of them.  Some was still in the bag, but would you want to eat something that did not come sealed?  Customer service was great again, refunding my money so I can buy another brand of salt.  Packaging needs to be reassessed if they are going to continue to ship this item.

review/summary: The Bursting Flavor and Healing Power of Blessedly Beautiful, Simple Salt Crystals
review/text: These coarse crystals have the minerals intact, which is vital to the salt benefit and function.<br /><br />I don't know when or why purveyors of salt began removing the natural mineral content, but that action involved a frightening ignorance.<br /><br />For certain types of specific health issues (see below), the minerals in the sea salt crystals seem to work better for me in their crystalline (or coarse) form, than when I grind the salt, as I do for cooking or table usage salt.<br /><br />As others have noted, mineral-rich, coarse-sea-salt freshly grinded onto food is much crisper in its culinary effect, more satisfying to the taste buds, than pre-granulated, plain table salt (which has the minerals removed, minerals found naturally in sea salt and which enhance both health benefits and flavor bursts).<br /><br />Also, old style, granulated table salt has an added disadvantage from the fairly recent addition of a variety of anti-caking chemicals, some of which contain aluminum (silicoaluminate)... which I'm concerned may be a brain cell deteriorative, possibly at baseline cause for Alzheimer's.<br /><br />If I take a pinch of salt crystals (coarse sea salt contains crystals) 2 or sometimes 4 times per day, and place them in my mouth, moving them around to dissolve the salt in saliva on my teeth and gums, I find that both teeth and gums retain a much higher degree of health.  I had begun having minor tooth aches periodically, and this practice has alleviated that.<br /><br />As noted above, I'm 60-years-old; and with a debilitating liver ailment since I was 9, I find that when I have an attack of severe abdominal and back muscle cramps (which I get fairly frequently), a pinch of sea salt crystals in my mouth will stop those cramps.  In fact, when I take small amounts of sea salt crystals regularly enough, I don't get those cramps at all.  The cause and effect is immediate and direct, so I know this works for me.  From my experience, plain table salt, or even sea salt without the mineral content will not give this beneficial effect.  (I'm guessing it's the magnesium content which works here, though, it might be the wholeness of the natural balance of the particular mineral group within unadulterated salt).<br /><br />Of course, I also drink one, preferably two glasses of water along with the salt crystals, ingesting the water before, after, or both.<br /><br />I learned about the many benefits of sea salt crystals (with the natural mineral content not having been leached away in well meaning ignorance) from Dr. Batmanghelidj's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970245823">Obesity Cancer & Depression: Their Common Cause & Natural Cure</a>.  I recommend that book very highly and hope to be able to review it also.<br /><br />Dr Batman's books explain how, when, why, and how much water the body needs for optimum health, and sea salt crystals are a vital part of that program.<br /><br />Note that in this book he explains also how, when, and why a person can take too much salt and water. I suppose I'm "lucky" that I have a barometer for sea salt crystal needs.  When I'm not taking enough the cramps return.  During hot weather (or under other dehydrating conditions) when the body loses more salt and water, I have to increase the intake of both.<br /><br />As far as I recall, Dr. Batman hadn't mentioned the connection of sea salt to alleviate regular large muscle cramping.  That I discovered this on my own after I had been taking the sea salt regularly, due to reading Dr. Batman's book.<br /><br />Bless this man for standing up to so many medical fallacies which are literally creating diseases, then causing addiction to high cost medications which do NOT cure the ailment, but add several other ailments into a complex medical condition which piles prescriptions on top of prescriptions.<br /><br />My thanks to Amazon for providing a variety of excellent sea salt products in coarse, crystalline form.<br /><br />With Respect for the maverick M.D.'s who actually apply and teach true healing,<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books on KINDLE and Amazon Shorts

In Italy, it costs 50 cents per kilo retail (and I'm sure they are not losing money.) Here it costs three dollars! Ridiculous.

review/summary: Better than Starbucks brand of ice coffee, but $5 is too much
review/text: I enjoyed the occasional Starbucks frappucino, but given that they are expensive and I drink them in about 10 seconds, I don't have the pleasure of buying them so often.  I stopped by my local Asian market today, looking for  something decidedly Japanese to try, and the iced coffee caught my eye.  I noticed this one was made in Japan (I'll admit I've never watched Eva, so I didn't know it was featured in that show/that it was the pioneer of canned coffee), so I picked it up.  I was immediately impressed.  The Starbucks variety has a sort of aftertaste that I can't describe, but this UCC brand is extremely smooth and, actually, probably the best I've had.  Not to sweet or syrupy, good balance of coffee and milk.  Delicious.<br /><br />It was less than $2 at the market.  The smaller variety of Starbucks frappucino costs more, and you get less.  I will be making a return trip to stock up on these soon.  The price and the wait on Amazon are certainly not worth it, given that you don't get much coffee in the first place.  Google your nearest Asian market, and if they don't have it, well, you will probably live sticking to Starbucks.  Or move to Japan, where the streets are PAVED with UCC canned coffee.  Or so I hear.

review/text: It's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out--great marketing idea.  They taste okay to me.  A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly they're lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla!

review/summary: The portable and edible Oreo
review/text: One reviewer writes that these are Oreo crackers without the creme--and they are right! These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!<br /><br />These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.<br /><br />I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.<br /><br />I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.<br /><br />Buy some and enjoy them today!

review/summary: Flavor in, Calories Down, Fat Nearly Out
review/text: As I get older and fatter, I seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy.  Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.<br /><br />Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.<br /><br />You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.<br /><br />Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.<br /><br />Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Now we have the Oreo transformed into a baked chocolate wafer snack
review/text: We are still six years away from the centennial for the Oreo cookie, which was first manufactured by Nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the English tend to use (it was copyrighted as the "Oreo Biscuit").  The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the "modern" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for "hill"), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the "cream" in between.<br /><br />Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.<br /><br />But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br />These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: "Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit.

review/summary: not as good as the 100-calorie Oreos
review/text: With any low fat or low calorie food, you're going to sacrifice taste of portion size.  With this product, you sacrifice both.<br /><br />It's a good idea, which was done well with the Oreos and others in this series of "100 calorie" snacks, but I think you're better off with a single cookie from the regular Chips Ahoy box than a whole bag of these.

review/summary: THESE ARE TRUE 'MAINSTREAM' DIET SNACKS --
review/text: FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES<br /><br />When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, "100 calorie packs" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + "ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS" & "ARTIFICIAL COLORS" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history.

review/summary: Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not?
review/text: I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of "A Star Is Born" the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are "100 Calorie Packs", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.

review/text: Let me begin by saying that I do not like Oreo cookies at all. I think the cookie part is bitter and I hate the white cream filling. When a friend suggested I try these I was reluctant and kept telling her that I was not interested. She insisted so I tried a few and surprisingly did not find them to be bad at all. I'm diabetic, so this is not a snack I will be eating often, but a few here and there won't hurt. If you're expecting these to taste like Oreo cookies (I'm one who's glad they didn't!!), then you'll be disappointed. But if you want a chocolate snack that's low in calories and fat please give these a try.

If you like cake and like Oreos you can't go wrong with Oreo cakesters.<br /><br />The filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new Oreo experience. Certainly worth a try - guaranteed enjoyment!

This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre.

So, it's a special treat that brings back all kinds of good memories to find Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br /> No, I was not one who pulled the cookie apart to lap the frosting, I just loved the chocolatey taste and that is all in these cookies less the unwanted cals. They're crispy, crunchy, chocolate wafers - a wonderful comfort snack.<br /><br /> A high five for Oreo Thin Crisps!<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke

review/summary: Delicious Mini Chocolate Treats Help Weight Loss Efforts!
review/text: I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.<br /><br />The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.<br /><br />The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.<br /><br />My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!<br /><br />My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.<br /><br />I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!<br /><br />I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.<br /><br />If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.<br /><br />I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you.

review/summary: I agree with P. Lucas
review/text: These things are NOTHING like Oreos.You think wow Oreos. Think again. I would say spend your money on something better (the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars come to mind). My honest view on these "thin crisps" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones.

review/text: To be honest with you, I got these at a store. You think wow chocolate chips, and Oreos. Think again.For those that think these are so good, I would recommend the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars. My honest view on these "thin crisps" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones.

review/summary: these ain't oreo's
review/text: These things are low cal oreo's: minus the creme, minus the cookie! The title "oreo" is basically a total misnomer. These are nothing but black crackers with some sugar. If that is what you want, then click purchase.

review/summary: Good product but not fresh
review/text: These arrived in the middle of May and they have an expiration date of the first week of July. This means I have to eat a lot of these in the next few weeks! Just beware if you're planning on stocking up for the future...the future will get here very soon with these!<br /><br />It's also interesting that the box inside the Amazon box says "For internal use only". I'm not sure what that's about!

review/summary: the best all purpose seasoning ever.
review/text: I live in mich. and I first used it in Seattle Wa. 15 years ago at my sister in laws house. I would either have her send it to me or bring it home with me when I went for a visit and buying six at a time. I recently got my own computer so I was delighted when I could buy it from Amazon. .

review/summary: The best season salt
review/text: Johnny's is the best season salt. Can't find it out here on the east coast, but always bought it when on the west coast. I was going to order it directly from Johnny's, but found a better deal here. The free freight made it the more economical option.

review/summary: The BEST!
review/text: If I could give this seasoning salt 10 stars I would! I discovered it when I lived in California 7 years ago and have been using it ever since. No other seasoning salt I have used can even come CLOSE to this one. If you're looking for a flavorful seasoning you have to try this. I can't find it locally any more so I am thrilled Amazon sells it online! I bought the 32 oz 3 packs.<br /><br />Try it and you'll never use another seasoning salt again!

review/summary: Knorr Aromat
review/text: My daughter recently visited Sweden with her boyfriend.  One of the gifts she brought me was Knorr Aromat.  I tried this seasoning and fell in love with it.  Unfortunately when I ran out I was disappointed to find out this spice is not available at any of my local stores.  I used it on sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, steaks, chickens, and vegetables.  This is the best tasting spice I have ever used.  The best part is it does not overpower your food. So excited to find that I am now able to purchase this product on-line.
