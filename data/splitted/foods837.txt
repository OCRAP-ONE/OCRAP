review/summary: organic fruit snack
review/text: I got these especially for my 3 yr. old son. I like that they are organic. He especially likes the strawberry ones so if I reorder I won't bother with the variety pack. The only drawback is that they are pretty chewy for his little teeth to bite and chew up. From that perspective, a bite-size fruit snack would be better than the rope.

They are a treat, though, because at 57 cents a piece with subscribe and save it's still a little pricey. We ration them because 24 pack would be gone in a week if we all had our way!

review/text: I like Clif products because they always use mostly organic ingredients. These fruit snacks are my wife's favorite. Normally our trip to Whole Foods we make every couple months (70 miles away) is when we buy them and try to stock up. This a very good price for it though, and should last longer. My wife likes these flavors, especially Strawberry and Mixed Berry. Although there are some other flavors that she likes, this is a good deal for these flavors.

review/summary: Doesn't taste good, texture is weird
review/text: I bought these to pack in my preschooler's lunch because I thought they would be a good replacement for cookies or crackers.  We pack real fruit also, but sometimes it is nice to have a different type of treat.  The only problem is that my kid took a bite of one of them and was disgusted by it.  I thought maybe she was being a little resistant to a new food, so I decided to try it out myself.  I tried the strawberry one and it was rather bitter, not at all sweet.  In addition, the texture was weird.  It's really hard to explain the texture.  I was expecting it to be like licorice, but it was more like eating a gummy worm that had been sitting in the sun or something - squishy, grainy, and not at all like licorice.

review/summary: The only twisted thing here is that they are making money off of this
review/text: I bought these looking for a healthy alternative to fruit roll-up type snacks, and they are insomuch that healthy means they dont poison you, however they have nothing to offer more than a heaping 15g of sugar (half a soft drink), more or less the same taste for each flavor, little to no nutritional value (being mostly apple juice), and all that at $.66 a piece. Not a big deal given that there are no real alternatives, except wait, they taste exactly like prunes, which have 10x less sugar, alot of nutritional value, and cost about a 1/3 of the price of this pathetic attempt of pushing empty sugar on kids under the guide of being healthy organic food.<br /><br />Clif Co. stooped to the level of major corporations and attempted to manipulate its customers through deceptive marketing practices. They have certainly lost my business.

review/summary: Great snacks, a little sticky--
review/text: My 13-month old loves these!  They almost always satisfy her in the car or stroller.  They do have a larger portion of sugar than I like, so I try to give her 1/2 at a time... but it's sugar from the fruit, not added sugar, so I don't mind as much.  They have great taste and are easy to take along in the diaper bag or a pocket.  Hands will be sticky after your kid is done with this snack...<br /><br />This is a 5-star product except for the sugar content... although I'm not sure I'm being fair deducting a star for natural sugar.  It's not more than an actual apple or banana... it's just that there's more sugar than she usually eats in one snack.

review/text: I started purchasing Merrick cat food for my cats about a month ago. The Merrick 5 star Gourmet is what they've been eating, and they love it. I had read good things about Merrick's BG line too and thought I'd try it out to give them even more of a variety. I went with the quail and chicken Pate. The food came this morning, they still have cans of the Merrick Gourmet in the cupboard, but I was eager to see if they were going to like the BG as much so I gave them this for breakfast, plus they'd never had quail and was wondering if they'd like it. After I got some down in the first plate to one of them, I was barely able to get it in the second..the other two were trying to pull the can down out of my hand. They scarfed it up, so I guess they do like quail after all. I know not all cats are the same, some are more finicky..I have 3 cats, one is very finicky, the other two not so much, but they all loved this and I'm glad because this is a really good quality, healthy food.

review/summary: I want my cats to like this so badly!!
review/text: Healthy catfood is really important to me; I've got one cat that has wheat/corn sensitivities and another that's just super high energy and needs food to match.  So I"m constantly searching for food that's (a) corn-free and ideally free of all grains, (b) high meat content and ideally "good" meat not castoffs, byproducts etc and (c) not going to completely bankrupt me.  Oh, and of course....that my cats will actually eat. Sigh.<br /><br />This sort of meets the mark....my cats hated this food though at first.  Would NOT eat it.  Over time, they are getting better, but its still not their favorite and sometimes they will totally reject it.  It's also not all that cheap.  I really want to like it, because it's got great ingredients and I know it's good for them...but I can't rate it as highly as I want to because if they won't eat it consistently, it does me no good.  Wasted expensive cat food = bad.

review/summary: Excellent product, hermetically sealed for freshness
review/text: Recently purchase this product in bulk (5 lb bag) for 12 because I was tired of paying almost 3 bucks for a tiny box of pearl/Israeli couscous at the local grocery store. We used the couscous over the weekend in my husband's ground-lamb-and-mint recipe, and it was fantastic.  In his recipe, you cook the couscous and lamb separately, then stir them together before serving. Honestly, I could have eatten the entire pot of couscous without even adding in the lamb component, it was so good! That's saying something, as my husband's recipe is a crowd pleaser. Couscous just needed a little salt, and it was delicous on its own.  I may ask my husband to create this dish again this week...<br /><br />BTW, I stored the remaining couscous in an extra large glass Bormioli Rocco Fido jar with a rubber seal to keep it fresh. It is attractive in the glass jar, and I don't have to worry about keeping the dry couscous fresh.

review/text: This is the first time I have had Papaya in a can. I usually opt for a fresh one, but being that I am in the midwest US, we are in the winter season right now and the travel time for a fresh papaya to get to the store here really impacts the taste. Not a good thing.<br /><br />Since canned fruits are picked at the peek of their ripeness, I figured I would try these out and have to say I was not disappointed. I just wish they put more in the can. If you like Papaya though, I do no think you will be disappointed. Plus organic, thanks amazon.

review/text: Well, I've never had canned Papaya before. But there it was! My local Fresh and Easy Srore had a stack of about a dozen cans of Native Forest Organic Papaya Chunks on sale at a big discount. I guess they were stopping stocking the item and just wanted to get rid of the ones they had. Well, I'll certainly give it a try. My previous experience with papaya was fresh (in Hawaii, oh man was it good!) and dried in several varieties (quite good). Okay, here's fresh organic papaya chunks packed in organic pineapple juice. Does that sound good, or what? Hmmm. It's a product of Sri Lanka. Well, I've never had anything from Sri Lanka before.<br /><br />This can of papaya chunks is excellent!! The taste is real good and it must have been canned right at the peak of ripeness. Good as it is, it's not very high in calories (60 per serving and three servings per 14-ounce can). It's quite sweet, but I note there's no added sugar, it's just papaya and pineapple juice. Of course, it's got zero fat and no sodium either. Plus there some fiber and a lot of vitamin C. Boy, this stuff is not only delicious, it's just the nutrient mix I seek. I'm going to have to go back and buy up the whole display!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: PBA-free cans! Hi quality, organic papaya chunks
review/text: Update 1/19/12: Native Forest organic canned fruit is now PBA-FREE cans!  I love their organic papaya packed in pineapple juice--great taste,  and organic.  I've opened 6 cans so far, and so far the quality of the papaya chunks has been very high--no mushy overripe or green peel.  Amazon's price is the lowest price I found currently if you do Subscribe and Save.  Really like Amazon's Subscribe and Save: you can cancel at any time; change shipment dates; Amazon gives you email alert prior to shipment so you can cancel if you're not yet ready for a refill; even if you decide to cancel after only 1 order, you still get the low Subscribe and Save price.  Way to go Amazon.<br /><br />I was excited when I found these organic papaya chunks on Amazon.  I like the taste of papaya, and its a great digestive aide, with anti-acid effects.  But organic ones are hard to find fresh at decent prices, and the season for "fresh" ones is very short.  So we ordered a pack of these from Amazon to try.  Amazon's pack price subscribe and save was a bargain.  But after I'd already ordered and the order was in shipment, my wife said, "By the way, did you check with the manufacturer to see if the cans are PBA-free?"  Duhhh!  For us, it's a priority to try to avoid toxins like PBA in our foods.  And I certainly knew that most canned foods were in PBA-lined cans, and that recent research proved that the PBA leached from the can linings into the food.  I also knew that the best food manufacturers are in the process of converting to non-PBA cans.  I must have been in a real brain fog In my feverish excitement at finding affordable organic papaya, because I totally forgot the PBA question prior to clicking "order" at Amazon.  So I called "Edward & Sons"--the company that produces "Native Forest" brand organic foods [805-684-8500; [...]; Carpenteria, CA].  The pleasant staff told me that they were in the process of converting their products to PBA-free cans, but the organic papaya had not yet been converted to PBA-free cans, and they suggested I check back in a few months.  Bummer!  Summary: I temporarily give these a 1 star because of the PBA in the cans--very bad toxin; we won't eat any more until they're in PBA-free cans.  But for taste, quality, being organic, and reasonably priced, we would rate them 5 star.  So once Edward & Sons converts them to PBA-free cans, we'll rate them 5 star.  We applaud Edward & Sons for their commitment to being a leader in eliminating PBA in their cans.

review/text: I cannot believe how badly these cans were damaged in the box, including one whose metal flip-tab was bent, creating a leak which allowed juice from the can to spew out in the plastic wrap. Ugh. Now I have to figure out how to contact Amazon to see if I have to return all 6 cans or just the 3 damaged ones. Not happy. The box is small and suprisingly heavy, so the shipper probably dropped it (or it fell off the top of other packages in the truck during shifting in transit because of its weight)--like I said, it's heavy, yet small. This was NOT marked on the outside as a food item, or fragile, or at the very least, it should be marked as heavy, so that the shipper can be warned.

review/summary: My daughter loves these
review/text: In addition to being a quality pasta, these tiny letters are fun to play with on their own.  They take about 10 minutes of boiling to cook, which surprised me, because they are so tiny.  However, they have to absorb a lot of water because they just about double in every dimension when cooked.  The pasta tastes good, and appears to be well-made and carefully packaged.<br /><br />I don't like to give my 3-year-old canned alphabet soup, since it contains a ton of sodium, MSG, and soggy vegetables, and it turns out she prefers these.  To make a quick snack for her, I use:<br /><br />1 cup organic chicken broth (low sodium)<br /><br />1/4 cup alphabet pasta<br /><br />pinch of salt<br /><br />Combine in a small saucepan and heat on medium for 12-13 minutes, starting with cold broth.  You can add more broth, throw in some cooked chicken, veggies, herbs, or whatever your child likes.

review/text: I used to love this product and drank it every day.  But now it has a label about the improved taste.  It's not an improvement.  It sour and kind of like the water you've cooked the peas in.  A big disappointment.  I hope they keep the old flavor available.

review/summary: a delicious soda that brings back fond memories
review/text: Recently we dined at a Brazilian restaurant and enjoyed this wonderful soda. Both my husband and sister-in-law  grew up in Brasil and have fond memories of enjoying Guarana.  On a whim, I searched amazon.com on the off chance that Guarana might be available. What a pleasant surprise to see that it is available!  The flavor is something like ginger ale - but oh so much better and refreshing. We ordered for ourselves and for our family in IL. We will order again.

review/text: I love Guarana Antarctica. The problem is that it is hard to find near my home. Since Amazon had it for less than $2 a can with free shipping, it was a no brainer. Unfortunately, this no longer appears to be an option, with the price of shipping actually exceeding the price of the product. Oh well.

review/summary: no longer marketed in US?
review/text: This is the ONLY Guarana soft drink...in my humble opionion.<br />None of the others come even close to the wonderful flavor of the Antarctica brand.<br /><br />This brand used to be readily available in quite a few shopping markets in our area.<br />Suddenly, within the past few years, it has disappeared, replaced by a different brand<br />that, quite frankly, sucks.<br /><br />I haven't seen anything anywhere to indicate why it disappeared.<br />Does anyone know what happened?<br />Have they [Antarctica] just stopped exporting to the US?<br /><br />We have a rather dense Brasillian population around here (north of Boston, MA)<br />so I'm certain we're not the only ones upset by this devestating loss.<br /><br />Thank God for Amazon, we can still purchase it... but for $30+ a case (after shipping),<br />it's suddenly become a cost prohibitive luxury item.<br /><br />Bring it back to the US Antarctica, PLEASE!

Its a must every time we go back to that restaurant which is quite often. This is easily the best ginger ale we have had to date and we have had a lot of good ginger ales.  The only bad thing is it is virtually impossible to find at least in the mid Atlantic states.  I would highly recommend this soda to anyone.

Over ice with an orange wedge it's outstanding.

review/text: I really enjoy this tea, after I had figured out not to use boiling water when making it. Apparently, white and green tea become bitter if the water is too hot and it is steeped too long. So, my recommendation is to let the water cool a little and steep the tea for about one minute or less. I says 3 minutes on the box, but to my taste that is too long. Quite a subtle peach flavor, not artificial tasting. White tea has more antioxidants and less caffeine than green or black tea. So happy to have found a tasty beverage that is good for my health and the health of the planet!

review/summary: A BLAST FROM THE PAST!
review/text: I haven't had tapioca in ages. I just tried my first Bubble Tea recently & loved it. Even though this was not what I expected (which was Boba tapioca), I just made it from the directions on the back for Tapioca (which was time consuming, but good), it came out good. I tried something else, which doesn't take as long & less ingredients, & it came out great! I love the large pearls, so I got the Jello Tapioca mix, added these (soaked of course), & it Is heaven! I will. E getting these again when I need more. Definately a good buy! I would recommend it. Try different things. You'll be amazed!<br /><br />Edit:  The best way to make tapioca:<br />Use 1/3 cup tapioca (as on package), soak overnight<br />2 packages Jello Tapioca Pudding mix<br />4 cups 1/2 & 1/2<br />1 cup 1% milk<br /><br /> Follow directions on the back of of the mix with the ingredients above. It comes out perfect. Great flavor and perfect consistency.<br /><br />ENJOY!!!

review/summary: Good produce, poor recipe
review/text: These pearls have been good in the past for use in tapioca pudding (which goes really fast in our house) They are easy to soak and simple to use.<br /><br />The problem is the recipe calls for the egg to be used in a manner that most will find gets them "chickeny" smelling tapioca pudding when the finished product is finally cold. I'd suggest looking elsewhere for a tapioca pudding recipe.

review/summary: Convenient and Portable
review/text: I love  Tabasco!!  Sometimes when dining out at a restaurant the servers won't provide it or offer another brand.  In order to avoid this, I started carrying a bottle in my purse.  When I saw these packets, I immediately ordered them.  I put several in a ziplock bag and carry them in my purse.  They're much lighter than the bottle I used to have.  The only drawback is that .11 ounces is not really a "single serving" -- especially for a Tabasco lover.  I usually end up using four or five, depending on what I am eating.  But they are convenient and I don't have to worry about other diners thinking I am pilfering the Tabasco bottle when they see me putting it back into my purse!!

review/text: For those who love Tabasco on just about everything, Tabasco Pepper Sauce Single Serve Packages are a terrific idea.  Too bad they are no where to be found in the stores.  I scoured the Internet looking for them because of this. When I found them here on Amazon, especially at such a great deal, I jumped on it.  They arrived quickly and as described.  They are very handy to take along in the lunch bag, picnic basket, glove box or purse, so Tabasco sauce always available for meals on the go.  Stores should carry these; Tabasco lovers would buy them.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025UBVXI">Tabasco Pepper Sauce, 0.11-Ounce Single Serve Packages (Pack of 200)</a>

review/summary: This Food Arrives Fresh
review/text: My daughter visited Ireland a couple of years ago. She loved everything about the country, including the food. I ordered this in November for her as a Christmas gift, not thinking that the items would all be fresh in order to be the best. My fault for not looking closer. I've bought Hickory Farms for years and their stuff is processed to last forever...fresh is better, but when you spend this much for one meal you should be aware that it is not something you can save fresh for a special occasion.<br /><br />They might want to put a line in the description letting people know the shelf life is not that long. It has to be eaten within a short period after you get it or frozen. Don't order too far in advance for a gift.<br /><br />Very fast shipping. Everything is as shown. The food arrives fresh, packed in ice. We're having our traditional Irish breakfast on Saturday before Thanksgiving instead of Christmas morning. Everything looks great. I'm sure it will be wonderful.

review/summary: Made in Chile ( on the can)
review/text: I guess I am a proponent of American-made products user, especially food! I received three cases of Green Giant asparagus with the hope that it would improve my health (as mentioned by one other reviewer). I suppose I could overlook made in Chile if the product was at least edible. As opposed to asparagus tips, approximately 20% of this product was impossible to chew as it appeared it was the very bottom of the asparagus stem or stalks. I canceled my order and I believe Amazon.com should state those foods that are imported like the Bumblebee salmon which claimed " made in Alaska" on the advertisement on Amazon.com. Turns out it was made in Thailand. Customer service sent me another free case and this time it was made in Alaska~~WTF?  I thought this was going to be a good way for me to stock up my pantry and not have to lug cases from wholesale stores into my home. Unfortunately I am disabled and I can't rely on other people to shop for me. I guess I'll have to reevaluate each of the 20 or 30 items I've elected to have shipped on a regular basis. Other items I purchased, advertised " cane sugar" and when I received them there was no cane sugar only fructose. I have another free case of that coming too and hopefully it will say cane sugar not fructose. Let's get real here Amazon and call it like it is as I have better things to do than write negative reviews which I've never done before until I started purchasing " gourmet foods" from Amazon. I really hope this helps somebody~~

I have used most every brand of canned asparagus and this is the first I've ever bought that was so stringy and woody I had to press the soup though a sieve and thereby waste a good part of it. To add insult to injury I paid a premium for it over the good house brand I usually buy, because it was low sodium.<br /><br />I'll not buy it again, needless to say, and have warned my soup-making daughters about it.<br /><br />I am surprised and disappointed that a reputable company like Green Giant would market a product like this. I hope the negative reviews here will be a wakeup call for them.

review/text: I am not a vegetable lover but read some testimonies about individuals being cured of serious issues with cancer by eating pureed asparagus twice a day on a regular basis.  Eating asparagus for breakfast is not the greatest, but I am giving it a go.  If it is a cure, it is probably a prevention.  In any event, it can not hurt, so I get a monthly delivery from Amazon.  If I end up dead from cancer, it did not work but was worth a try.  What the hey?

review/summary: excellent product.  low salt and good nutrition
review/text: I use this a my vegetable drink every morning.  I put the can contents into a blender and pulverize it into a paste.  I take that and put 3 tablespoons into a glass of water.  It isn't too bad as a veggie drink but really gives a kick of energy as well as all the tremendous vitamins and minerals asparagus has.  One can will last about a week this way and you wouldn't want it to go any further due to potential spoilage.  It is a power pack of nutrition and a great easy way to start the day without a heavy stomach feeling.  My diet is largely liquid due to digestion problems so drinking my meals works very well and yes I have one meal of real food to keep the intestinal tract strong, but this is a great way to start the day.  I also add 2 tablespoons of ground flax mill seeds for my Omega counts.  If you are not an asparagus fan and prefer good food, this is the best vitamin/mineral supplement you could drink and it is cheap compared to the green drink powders.  I will point out that I don't find it highly yummy.  It is one of those things I make and drink because it is "good for me" not "good tasting" as I am not a fan of asparagus.  I use a 14 oz glass approximately for this drink, otherwise it is too thick.  Highly recommended.

I only get 100% meat treats, either freeze-dried or dehydrated. These are great because I can carry around a bunch of them and they're already the perfect size for training, plus they weigh next to nothing. For three large dogs, I give out maybe 10-30 treats per day and this lasts me about a month. No strong odor, nothing that causes an allergic reaction - have bought multiple times and will continue to buy.
