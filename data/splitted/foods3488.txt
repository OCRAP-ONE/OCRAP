review/summary: Wowww.......it's a flavored salt shaker......
review/text: I guess I was expecting something like the Campbells Mushroom soup but that is my fault since I did not notice the absence of the word 'condensed'.  However, the directions do say to ADD a can of water to this little can before heating.  But it is like drinking flavored water before you add any additional water.  I do like that there is quite a nice quantity of mushrooms included.  But....I find two main problems with this soup: it tasted like a bowl full of flavored salt and it is so loaded with Monosodium Glutamate that I woke up with a headache the next morning!!  This is what a large dose of MSG does to me so I know that they had to add lots of MSG to make this soup have any flavor at all.  I'll have to use it not as a soup but as a topping for casseroles or when baking chicken even though it is so dilute and loaded with salt and MSG.  Maybe I'll just give them to the local food bank.  The can may say it has 1875 mg of salt per small 10.5 ounce can but it tastes like it has at least twice that amount in it.....and this is a very small can of soup! That's nearly one whole day's worth of allowable salt per one small can.  And ofcourse the neurotoxicity of the MSG is soooo scary too.  No, I can not recommend this soup to anyone!  Heck, I won't ever buy any Rokeach product ever again!  Stay away from this disceptively dangerous little can!

review/summary: The taste if Italy.
review/text: I was on the look out for a coffee that would taste like the coffee's I was drinking while in Rome. I came across this "Tazzina" Siena in a "Home Goods" store here in PA. for 5 bucks and thought, "what the hey" so, I bought it and never turned back. It has a deep java dark end and a very even middle bounce and the top is ever so smooth. It makes a beautiful espresso or latte. Although finding it a second time there proved unlikely. So I buy it online here at Amazon as no one else sells it anywhere I can find and I have done extensive searching.. My only gripe is the shipping cost is outrageous and the cost of the coffee keeps going up and now I don't buy it as much. Just not worth the price IMHO.. I have switched to "Star Bucks" Italian Roast whole bean. While it's not the same creamy top, it comes pretty close when using a french press and steamed milk and you can find that anywhere for a lot less as there's no gouging shipping fee!

review/summary: Under the Tuscan Sun
review/text: Amy's Tuscan Bean and Rice Soup is an attempt to evoke the sunny Northern Italian countryside, with its vineyards and villas. It tastes okay with some Parmesan on it, but it lacks the usual Italian zest. The combination of rice and beans is hearty (making a complete protein). It IS a "soup that eats like a meal." Unfortunately, it would probably taste better if it were made fresh.<br /><br />Amy's Organic soups tend to be very good. Get her Thai soup instead, if you want to spice things up.

review/summary: very good filling soup
review/text: I'm a huge fan of nearly all of the Amy's food line.  This soup does not disappoint in terms of heartiness and its ability to serve as a meal.  As a soup and salad girl, this soup has the ability to keep me full which is my number one priority when I don't know when I will be home to make a meal.  As another poster noted, this would probably taste better if freshly made.  I can't disagree.  Anything tastes better if simmered in a pot for several hours.  If you don't have the time, this is a good, vegetarian alternative that is sure to satisfy many.  The flavor is rich but not spicy or too salty. This Amy's product does not disappoint.

review/summary: Soup Cravings
review/text: I purchased this item because Amy has another soup, the rustic vegetable one, that is so yummy.  So, I was more open to tasting this one since I bought 12 of the other and now know how good it is.  As compared to the other rustic vegetable one, for me, this one isn't as tasty, but still very good.  I gave some to my friend, and she loved it immediately.  It depends on your taste and perspectives.  I trust Amy's products so anything you buy is good to great tasting and also healthy.  So, overall good taste and well trusted brand, but I'd just prefer their other soup better.  Get it if you are ok with the ingredients and are lazy to cook.  great for feeling I'll and still following a healthy food plan.

review/text: I keep canned soup for dinner emergencies when I can't cook at home and don't want to get some gready take-out. I love Amy's soups and I have quite a few types stored in the pantry, but this is my favorite. I love the texture of the rice and the falvour of the soup. And the Amazon price can't be beat if you subscribe to this. Definitely worth a try.

review/text: I enjoy this soup so much that I eat it once per week for my take to work lunch. I tend to bring soups for lunch because they're quick to heat up and easy to bring good side dishes to make a complete meal.<br /><br />This soup is filling enough on it's own that I normally only bring some chips for a lunch that satisfies without leaving me over filled and uncomfortable. There are several vegetables in the soup and they hold together well. The rice and beans have a great flavor and texture.

review/text: I am a big fan of the Amy's products and the soups that I have tried have been great.  I wanted to try something new and I came across this one at the store several times before finally purchasing it.  I liked the looks of the ingredients and it being a complete protien I was sure it would be a winner. YUCK!!!  Not only was it gummy but the flavor was just terrible.  I cant even put my finger on what it was but it was very unpleasant.  So I actually found a soup that was terrible, so sorry Amy but you need to change this recipe or put 100 bucks in each can for me to buy it again.<br /><br />Great soups that I have tried by Amy's<br />Lentil<br />Lenitl vegetable<br />Curried Lentil<br />Black bean<br />Southwestern vegetable

review/text: The first thing I noticed was that it had plenty of flavor and spices. It tasted really good. but I take one star away because I expected it to be thicker. I thought it would have more beans in it almost like a chili. But its more like a soup with not as many beans as I thought it would have. But than again i never looked up the word tuscan so that may just be my naivity when i bought it not knowing what it was. But it does taste good plus its organic with no negative additives.

review/summary: Good soup - bad can condition
review/text: About a quarter of the case of soup cans arrived in damaged condition. This soup was purchased for rainy day/storage and or disaster conditions. Beans and rice combined make perfect protein.<br /><br /> With the damaged cans however, many cans have to be consumed now, if at all. These cans weren't dented, they were crushed. I don't like the idea of eating the metal from the cans mixed in with the soup.<br /><br /> Excellent soup from Amy's, but Amazon, get it together with your shipping. It's not right to sell your customer's damaged goods.

review/summary: Five-Star dog food!
review/text: Having become aware of the terrible things American dog food manufacturers are putting into our doggies' foods, I spent months searching for a great food that would help keep our dogs healthy and live their full lives.  This is it.  Our vet was excited that we were changing to Precise Holistic dog food for our small dogs!  She couldn't have given more praise to this dog food.  This food is so good and devoid of filler, that your dogs will only need to eat a smaller amount.  It is rich enough that they will feel satisfied and full with that smaller amount.  Be sure to consult with your vet on how to make the change from your current food to Precise Holistic.  It is such a change in quality, that you need to make the switch very slowly so your dog's system can adequately get used to all its goodness without digestive upset.  But it's worth the small attention you'll have to pay to the switch over.  Now that our dogs are used to it, they love it.  Even our finicky eater!

review/summary: Horrible Artificial Flavor
review/text: This peach tea honestly tastes like it was flavored with peach-scented soap.  The tea itself is probably fine, but the flavoring that they used is overpowering and barely resembles peach flavor.  After I opened the package, a cheap, artificial peach scent filled the entire room, which was not bad in itself, but the soapy taste made this tea completely unacceptable.  It sounds cruel to say this, but the flavor of this tea is closer to peach shampoo than peach tea.

I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />After trying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NH09R8">Tea's Etc Oolong Tea, Orange Blossom, 3-Ounce</a> I expected this one to taste fantastic as well. On the first few flavor notes it does taste great: you get the mild black tea with peach flavor that builds quickly. Towards the end and a bit after it starts to taste a little off. I'm not sure if it's the sunflower flavor coming out or something else, but it just isn't for me.<br /><br />If you like peach tea and you need $3 to hit your $25 minimum, I'd say give it a shot. You can see the chunks of real peach and it smells great; it could just be my taster that's off.

review/summary: The ONLY Soy Sauce Alternative our Picky Eater will EAT!
review/text: Our daughter was diagnosed with allergies to Gluten, Casein & Soy when she was 18 months old.  Unfortunately, one of her favorite food treats was rice with soy sauce.  We tried making all kinds of alternative soy sauces using recipes we found online that met her allergy restrictions and nothing appealed to her taste buds.  Finally, one day we accidentally found Coconut Aminos!!  This has been a lifesaver!  We love the product, and unlike another reviewer, we DO use it for fried rice...we just add fish sauce to offset the sweetness.  We don't have any other option for soy sauce, and it works great!<br /><br />The only thing we do NOT like about this product is that it has a bit of an effervescent quality to it...MANY bottles that we have purchased have burst and leaked.  Also, it is a mess to pour.  I asked the company if it would harm the product at all to put it in a soy sauce type dispenser bottle and they "didn't think so."  LOL  We tried it and have not noticed a quality difference, so that is how we use it now...from a spouted dispenser.<br /><br />We feel very blessed to have found this (luckily we stumbled upon it early in her diet and she is now 3...so we have used it for 18 months or so...

review/summary: Great taste, but needs a shaker top!
review/text: Being Celiac, allergic to soy, and part Asian, this is a wonderful soy sauce substitute for me!  The flavor is sweeter than soy sauce, as others have mentioned, and it is not as strong.  Also, I am glad that it is organic... or I wouldn't have even tried it.  Eating "clean" can be challenging at times and this adds a wonderful flavor without the guilt or the queasy stomach I get from soy sauce.<br /><br />Two things that need improvement:  Why is there NO shaker top?  This is such a little, but HUGELY important thing!!!  The second thing is that there needs to be an option for a larger size bottle and at a more reasonable price.  Six bucks is too much for a meager 8 oz.  Add a shaker top (like every soy sauce has) and offer a 16 oz size, and I'll gladly make this a 5 star rating :)

review/summary: What was left of the bottle was fine...
review/text: I know that there are divided camps when it comes to whether or not shipping issues should be part of a product review.  I generally think that shipping is a separate concern, but I'm not so sure after this purchase!  I purchased this product from D.M.E. ONLINE SALES INC (AKA Medical Supply Superstore), but it was shipped by Amazon.  When the package arrived, more than a quarter of it had leaked through both the padded manilla envelope and the box it was shipped in, staining the other item in the box (gloves), as well as the outside of the box that was delivered.  I contacted D.M.E. and they said that it was not their responsability because they didn't handle the shipping.  Which I would agree with, except that there was NOTHING wrong with the packaging; upon closer inspection, the lid of the bottle (beneath the safety seal) hadn't been properly screwed on -something that the company definitely OUGHT to take responsability for!  When I emailed the company to explain this, they never responded. In this case the shipping is very important for the review because losing nearly a third of the product before you get it makes this a VERY expensive product!

review/summary: Yay! A gluten- and soy-free alternative!
review/text: My diet is gluten- and soy-free (among lots of other things).  Pre-diagnosis I used regular soy sauce, then tamari (after the Celiac diagnosis).  I was never much of a edamame or tofu eater and didn't think I'd miss soy when that allergy diagnosis came along, but doing without tamari was tough.<br /><br />The office manager at my doctor's office raved about coconut aminos and at her urging I decided to give them a try.  I am so glad I did!  I haven't noticed much of a difference between coconut aminos and tamari.  I'd like to compare it to soy sauce for the sake of the review, but it's been so long since I've had soy sauce that I don't remember what it tastes like.<br /><br />I typically use this is stir fry, Thai peanut sauce, and barbecue sauce.  The results have been excellent and not too salty.

review/text: The first bottle leaked all over the inside of the UPS truck, and the replacement bottle leaked inside the box.  All together, I ended up with about one full bottle's worth of this product.  It is delicious and makes a good soy sauce replacement.  The fizzy nature, however, makes it difficult to ship.  Be prepared to ask for a refund and get a partial bottle of coconut aminos.

review/text: I was pretty bummed when I had to go on a soy and gluten free diet.  I like eating sushi and making many stir fry type meals.  I got really excited when I found this product.  So far it has delivered what I was looking for.  Like others have said this is a great alternative with a hint of sweetness.  In some ways its better than soy because it is lower in sodium.

review/text: I love this product! While reading the Body Ecology diet, they talked about this product. Glad I tried it.  It's salty still, but does have a slight coconut taste on its own WITHOUT altering the taste of my food when paired with anything else, even cukes.  Since I started using this, I haven't turned back.  I just hope 4 years from now, it's still "safe", "MSG-free", "GMO-free", "Organic" and all the rest of it.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: Yes, it has bones and skin in it.  I never knew you could buy canned salmon any other way!  So to me this is fine.  Plus, the skin has the fat in it, and it's the fat (omega-3 fats) that you want, so bring on the skin.  Is it as pristine and beautiful as it could be?  Probably not.  Most Roland products I've tried were more like the way supermarket canned brands look next to the appearance of the famous named brands, if you know what I mean, but you can't really do a whole lot to mess up a salmon.<br /><br />And I will have to say, this is a product of the USA and I like that.  I'm probably showing prejudice, but sometimes I kind of wonder what might be going into canned seafoods when they come from other countries--I've heard they can be grown in polluted water, for example--so I like to see this coming from Alaska.<br /><br />So five stars on this salmon.

review/summary: Wild Salmon...
review/text: The cannery which produces this pink salmon for Roland, produces for majority of the sellers selling pink salmon. Costco sells the worst tasting canned pink salmon, these are much better. Pink salmon is sold in cans. These are all small salmons so you will get couple of whole salmon in a can with all the bones and the skin. Amazon's product feature description is wrong. You can not take out the skin and the bone that easily so you may forget about buying this salmon. There is no vitamin A in this salmon either. I consume a lot of wild fish, sprats, sardines, herrings... no farm raised or fresh fish unless I catch it myself since fresh fish means few weeks old except shell fish which I get it in three days. The smaller the fish the more nutrition in the fish. I consume these salmon since these salmon stay in the rivers of cold Pacific for first few years in order not to be consumed by the bigger fish and feast on small bugs and fish which are high in nutrients. Bones means calcium. Skin means good polyunsaturated fat. I mix all my fish with many different vegetables since that is my main ingredient for protein.  This salmon is in water not vegetable oil. I drain the water since that is where the 2000 mg of salt is lingering around and no need to consume salt. Healthy, without any additives, growth hormones, pesticides, antibiotics, carpet dye, or sitting on a shelf exposed to air for few weeks... Sockeye salmon is the only fresh wild salmon you can get during the spring run and sold as smoked salmon which I consume but cost more. Atlantic and steelhead are only farm raised. Keta, Pink, Chum, Coho are always canned. Bravo.<br /><br />99% of all cans are lined in plastic which leach high levels of a chemical called Bisphenol A, which has been linked to cancer, clogging of arteries, birth defects, miscarriages, obesity, and insulin resistance, which can lead to Type II diabetes. Refer to the Environmental Working Group report on BPA for more information. This product claims that it has no BPA. According to the World's Healthiest Foods website, it is generally safer to eat fresh than it is to eat canned. Canned goods, sometimes are contaminated with harmful agents such as botulism.

If I had a complaint, it would be that they don't make the bags in any size larger than 6oz...Frankly 6oz. doesn't go very far for the $. That's why I'm so grateful to be able to get them through Amazon. Otherwise, I'd be much more hungry more often!

The wasabi flavor is good but a little bit on the mild side (not too surprising since the chip has to appeal to a lot of different palettes). The chips can sometimes be dense and crumbly so they're not always great for dipping.  Overall a very unique chip that I will be getting again.

I have to say that I love these chips.  I've tried some of the other flavors by the same company, and by far the Sea Salt is my favorite.

review/text: These are such good chips! Most rice chips are bland or have bad texture. These chips are crunchy and so tasty--a nice thick chip that is great for thick dips like hummus or peanut butter. We bring a bag to our local mediterranean place to use for hummus instead of pita bread (gluten allergy). Seriously, these chips are great. I buy them buy the case because our whole family loves to snack on them. Subscribe and save makes us save even more. I love lundberg products generally (try their gluten free cous cous), but their rice chips are my favorite.

review/text: I came across Lundberg Rice Chips at health food stores.  But...the price was at least $3.49 a bag and sometimes they wouldn't have the sea salt ones in stock.  I was looking for something that is satisfying to eat and does not have as much oil as potato chips. I find the rice chips very hearty.  There are other flavors available. I was excited to find that I could get a case through Amazon with free super saver shipping.

review/text: I'm always on the lookout for a good, natrual chip to snack on. Not that I don't love Doritos or cheese curls, but those chemically-boosted flavors tend to overwhelm my palette. Lately I've been investigating the world of natural "junk food". My only nod to the mainstream manufacturers is to stock the Frito Lay corn chips (fritos). They're corn, oil, and salt. And they're tasty.<br />But I digress...<br />Lundberg's Nacho Cheese chips are fantastic, certainly keeping my palette interested when I'm in a training routing and have to cut out most complex carbohydrates.

review/summary: Best gluten-free item out there!
review/text: I don't usually take the extra time to write reviews, but felt I should for this product because these chips are SO good and have been a lifesaver for my family (we're all gluten-free). As a general rule, we just avoid packaged foods, but the kids eat these chips for snack quite frequently, and my husband and I love them, too. They remind me a little bit of Bugles (the corn chip things), only without the nastiness. For those who have corn sensitivities (we do), these have masa corn in them, which our naturopath says is a different thing than regular corn and won't cause problems. Yummy. Only complaint I can think of is that they could pack more into a bag...there's a lot of air. The price on Amazon is significantly less than what we pay for these in the grocery store, so we order them in bulk every few weeks.

I am not going to throw them in the trash but they are not very yummy.

review/summary: fat-free AND next-best thing to sodium-free!
review/text: Broths or stocks have become ubiquitous in homestyle cooking, but many of us want to limit fat and sodium.  Fat-free broths such as this one are widely available, thank goodness (and you can make almost any broth fat-free yourself, just by chilling it, removing the top of the container, and discarding the fat which will have risen to the top).<br /><br />But it's pretty hard to find decent low-sodium broths, partly because it's cheaper for food companies to add salt than to flavor their product any other way.  Swanson's used to have fat-free, sodium-free broths that I swore by, but I literally can't find them anymore.<br /><br />This is the next best thing.  Both this and the beef version let you drastically cut back on the salt in what is, let's face it, the most voluminous ingredient in most of your cooking.<br /><br />Since studies suggest that average Americans eat at least twice the safe amount of sodium each day, and since high sodium intake is associated with high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and other health issues, these 50%-reduced-sodium broths can make a big difference for all of us.  Way to go!!  Now, if only we could get the sodium free versions??!!  :)
