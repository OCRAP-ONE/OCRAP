review/summary: Good price -- not clean...?
review/text: This is a great price, but every time I've bought these through Amazon, the bottles frequently have dark... "stuff" on the threads of the bottle when you open it.  I've never seen this when buying them from the local drugstore, so I worry that these are either old or maybe not authentic?<br /><br />Can't say for sure of course.  They do have the desired effect, so I'm not complaining too much.  It's kind of gross sometimes though.

review/summary: Safe, and EFFECTIVE
review/text: I recently gave up my major 20 year Diet Coke addiction.  I did it for a number of reasons.  I typically wake VERY early to hit the gym before work & needed something to help me wake up at 4:30 AM.  This product is GREAT.  No over-stimulation as it only has the caffeine equivalent of 1 cup of jo. It is also SUGAR FREE and has 0 Net Carbs!! I do feel the energy quickly & it lasts the 5 hours it claims.  The berry flavor is pleasant, but tart so I drink some water as a "chaser" (no pun intended).  I drink water the rest of the day & only use 1 in the morning unless I have a "late" meeting scheduled.

review/summary: Great Healthy Snack, Especially For A Vegetable Hater...
review/text: I started drinking tomato juice about 4 years ago.  I took a plunge one day and discovered I really liked it as a stand alone drink.  This is a big deal for me, as I HATE vegetables.  I am unfortunately one of those people who can not stomach them.<br /><br />Before you all laugh, this is no joke.  Just the smell of them makes me want to hurl.  When my mother is cooking squash, I have to stay away from the kitchen.  I tried to eat broccoli once, that did not go well.  I have never gagged so hard in my life...<br /><br />Anyway I have discovered I can sneak much needed vegetables into my diet through covert ways.  Lettace, pickles, and onion on my sandwich and chicken wraps.  I try to eat applesauce everyday, and I concocted a great bran smoothie recipe to get my fiber.  (See my profile for this great tasting, but healthy recipe).  I also drink tomato juice on a reguler basis.<br /><br />Is this the most heathly option, NO.  Cooking vegetables takes a lot the nutrients out of them.  Plus sodium is added, which is NOT good for blood pressure.  But it's better than nothing.  If your choice is a soda or a tomato juice, take the juice.<br /><br />These little containers are the perfect size.  They make bigger sizes, but I would recommend you stick with the 5.5 oz containers.  As I said the sodium is high, about 20 percent of the recommended daily intake.  I imagine the bigger size may be around 40 percent!!!<br /><br />You get pectin when you drink tomato juice, and a good dose of vitamin C, along with some other trace vitamins.  Great healthier option snack to keep in your locker at work or school.  Tastes best at room temperature.<br /><br />So if you are like me and trying desperately to find healthy sources of food that won't make you gag like a 2 year old, try this.  I mean hey, you probably like ketchup, this is pretty close...<br /><br />Also FYI, this price is pretty good as well.

review/summary: A flavor from the islands
review/text: Rum cakes are a holiday favorite of mine.  I ordered directly from the Tortuga Rum Company last year, christmas 2008, and got the golden original 33 ounce and the blue coffee 33 ounce.  I really loved the original, the coffee wasn't as much to my liking.  The original was really moist while the other tended to be more dry.  I also had to pay shipping.<br />  This year I ordered thru amazon and saved over $10 on the cost of the cake and I got free shipping.  The rum cake itself is sealed in plastic inside the box to retain it's rum content and freshness.  I am an occassional drinker; rum, tequila, bourbon being my favorites.  I didn't think that the rum was overpowering; yes you can tell its there, but also the flavor of the cake complements it.  I think they have an excellent "Rum Cake" and this would be a great indulgence for the holidays.  Highly recommended.  I will have to order another before christmas cause mine is already gone.

review/summary: An excellent product, better then expected
review/text: This truly is an excellent cake.  It is very moist and fairly flavorful.  At first it seems like just a typical pound cake, but then the rum flavor hits.  It's not overpowering at all, but it is notable and helps to enhance the flavor of the cake proper.  Warming up a thick slice in the microwave for 30 seconds to a minute, and then adding a large scoop of ice cream is quite nice.  Serving it with berries and whip cream I suspect would work well also.<br /><br />I won't remove stars for this, but the only minor complaint I have is that within the box it's in a plastic bag that can't be resealed.  I was hoping and expecting a metal tin.  I suspect the bottom of the cake would stick to the bottom of the cardboard box if I just put it in that after cutting open the bag.  Mind you, one can still put the cake in the open bag and refridgerate it, it does keep most of it's moistness, but if you have a large cookie tin or other method of storage other then the box, I would suggest it.

Then I decided I could easily bake him one at a fraction of the cost.  But I was sooooo wrong.  For starters,  I didn't have the right rum..Tortuga.  And I couldn't make it as moist as the original.  I admitted defeat and went back to ordering the Tortuga Original.  This cake is a true gem.  Don't hesitate to buy it!

I don't know if it was the island atmosphere or perhaps the cakes were just fresher, but the one I ordered, while decent enough, tasted a little artificial, kind of like the plastic it was wrapped up in.  I still enjoyed it, but it just didn't have that same flavor I remember.  Maybe next time I'm in the Carribean I'll try it again and find out, but as for ordering online, I don't feel like it's the same.

review/summary: More addicting than drugs! [that's a compliment!]
review/text: I have been a Tortuga Rum Cake addict since the 1980's during my many travels to Grand Cayman. At first, I could control my addiction, because I could only source "my fix" by purchasing a plane ticket and renting a condo for a week - a serious outlay of cash for a rum cake. Tortuga Rum Cakes were part of my daily routine. However, I had it under control for decades until this dastardly company decided to import this lucious treat into the US! How this got past customs on a regular basis baffled me - they must have sampled this treat on a regular basis and became as addicted as I am. Now I can get "my fix" via the internet. The world is doomed!<br /><br />Seriously, this is ONE delicious rum cake...and I'm not a big rum cake fan. I remember visiting the [then] little bakery on Grand Cayman and trying a sample. That was it for me. I have given these as gifts over the years [in all of their wonderful flavors] to friends. The first reaction is rather blase "Oh, a rum cake." Then they taste it and, they, too are doomed. A fabulous treat in any flavor [I'm particular to their Key Lime and Coconut besides the original] and it's just one of those "must haves" that keeps very well in the freezer. As a matter of fact, that's the way I prefer it - directly from the freezer. I can make razor cut slices of this yummy confection to make it last that much longer. This is one "deal" you'll never regret [other than the calories involved]. Love this stuff. Thankfully, there aren't any rum cake narcs nearby. :)

It's a lot easier than making your own and it tastes, well, rummier, than the ones I have baked. Don't hesitate to try one. Yum!

review/summary: "Let Them Eat Cake!"  Financing Available Folks!
review/text: Tortuga has been a standard in commercially prepared rum cakes and is very popular.  They are manufactured oversees in the Caribbean (Cayman Islands) and this is reflected in its $35 MSRP price. I have enjoyed these cakes on several occasions.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. They are moist with a deja vu hint of Tortuga rum-The original is the best in my assessment.<br />2. The cakes are packaged nicely to avoid damage in transit and sealed well to lock in moisture.<br />3. They taste good and are well balanced, pairing nicely with ice cream.<br />4. These are basically presented as rum-flavored Bundt cakes-fluted and sectioned for slicing.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. These cakes are extremely over-priced. For the price, you could not only prepare a far better and higher quality cake but also afford to lace it with a generous bath of rum.<br />2. Conventional ingredients-bleached white flour, aluminum, partially hydrogenated oils, preservatives and artificial food colorings and dyes.  This is apparent when you slice into the cake and need to grab your sunglasses from the bright yellow color of the cake-that's yellow dye folks...not gold rum! I can assure you...There's no gold in dem 'dere mills!<br />3. The walnuts on top of the cake are sparse.<br />4. You will need an electron microscope to measure the amount of rum in this cake.<br />5. The cake is very one-dimensional and could use a good rum icing to complement the flavor and complete this treat.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:  If you have the time, make your own for the best rum cake available.<br />  If all you make are reservations, then get the cake and ask Marie Antoinette to pay for it!

review/text: I admit I was a little skeptical when I first saw this on the shelf, but I'm one for trying new things so I decided to go for it.  (I had to get past the cost first -- this isn't exactly economical for a soda)<br /><br />It's surprisingly refreshing.  It has a nice subtle flavor, and is just like the description says -- "dry".  That is, it's not too sweet.  My wife and I often drink simple lime seltzer water, occasionally mixing in a splash of lemonade, so this low-sweetness beverage is right up our alley.  If only this was priced a bit better, I would switch to buying a few of these flavors as our main beverage!<br /><br />Though I haven't mixed it yet, I could see this being an excellent mixer for a top-shelf gin in place of tonic.  I'd recommend Hendricks.  (Though, I couldn't see ordering the drink at a bar... "I'll have a gin and lavender please".  Not.)  I'd bet the cucumber-flavor would be a good gin mixer as well.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's definitely worth a try.  Five stars for flavor, minus one for cost / value.

I also ordered a case of Lavender and Vanilla.  The Lavender I liked very much and did find it relaxing at night.  The vanilla was a little too sweet for my tastes and did leave an after-taste as the others noted above did not.  I would recommend this product, but this company must do something about the shipping costs.  HORRIBLE when shipping is more than the actual product, not even if you combo your order, each case is still $17.00 shipping!! Yikes!  I guess everything does have its trade-off, but this one is a little too much to swallow.

review/summary: Tastes like soap.
review/text: Recently, I was over watching the Celtics game at my friend's apartment. As the game grew more and more intense, I consequently grew more and more parched.<br /><br />"Hey Brian," I said. "You got anything to drink?"<br /><br />"Yeah!" he replied. "I've got some lavender soda in the fridge."<br /><br />"Lavender soda?" I asked, skeptical. "Where does a person even get lavender soda?"<br /><br />"It was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of Marshall's, so I bought it." Brian replied.<br /><br />I walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. Drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as I typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. However, I would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience I had hoped it would be.<br /><br />When I took my first sip, I thought to myself, "What have I gotten myself into this time?" The initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. "Interesting," I thought. "Perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first." However, as my drinking experience continued, I came to realize that this would not be the case. After I swallowed the soda, I was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. Like a bar of soap was in my mouth. This brought back horrible memories of my childhood...<br /><br />You see, when I was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to "wash my mouth out with soap" if I either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. Being one to always question my mother's conviction, I often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. This had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later I can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when I consider saying a bad word. Consequently, when I took my first taste of lavender soda, I was hit with a flood of emotions. I felt as though I had said a bad word or broken a rule. I felt as though I was being punished for something but could not recall what I had done. My vision began to become cloudy. I began to lose control of my small motor functions. I was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. I vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as I shall live, lest I suffer another episode such as the one described above.<br /><br />In summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. It might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but I, personally, do not prefer it.

review/text: I saw this at Marshall's and was curious and finally bought a 4 pack. I managed to drink most of one bottle.  It reminds me of 7 Up but without the lemon-lime flavor. It does not remind me of Sprite for some reason (I like Sprite better than 7 Up, but I'm not crazy about either one). It tastes slighty flowery (but not soapy) and slightly sweet.  It says it is made with sugar, but to me it has that artifical sweetener taste, and it did leave an aftertaste. I would not buy it again, but for what it is, I guess it's okay.

Threw out one, took the rest back to the store and exchanged them for the regular Fancy Feast varieties.  Try it - they really do smell like people food, but if you have fussy Persians, only buy one!

review/summary: Excellent crackers - hard to find.
review/text: I first bought Crackerthins at a local grocery. They had supply problems so I looked to online. These crackers, both plain and peppered, are excellent with good soft cheese. They are very thin and crisp so they aren't a lot of cracker with each bite.

review/summary: Exceptionally good cracker!
review/text: I had the pleasure of trying these crackers recently at a friend's home (she's from Australia).  She served them with a mild cheese.  I loved the light flavor; also liked that they weren't dry, bland and "crumbly" like all the other water crackers I've tried.  Even though they're a little pricey, I do plan to order several boxes in the near future.

review/summary: A nice cracker for rich spreads
review/text: Crackerthins Plain water crackers are very thin and crisp, but are only very mildly flavored. Excellent for a rich, flavorful spread whether savoury or sweet such as a pate or a soft cheese and fruit spread combination. The crackers are also very strong, able to stand up to a good smear of spread with ease, and have a nice crunch when you bite into them for being so thin. iGourmet ships them as shown in the picture, with two sleeves of crackers each in an individual plastic collar to prevent breakage and boxed. They arrived almost entirely intact with only 2 broken crackers which was much less breakage than I expected. I would order the cracked pepper version next time for the additional flavor which I think would compliment a mild cheese better.

When you're in the mood for a salty and crunchy snack or a complement to a sandwich, these really are perfect.  And, 12 pretzels are only 3 points on Weight Watchers and they're so filling.

review/summary: Tasty and wonderful in a wide range of recipes
review/text: I bought this from Amazon about six months ago, after reading several Japanese cookbooks and nutrition articles that extol the benefits of the vitamin B and iodine rich kombu seaweed. (American soils are iodine deficient, so this is a good way to get it).  It is mild in taste and doesn't taste "sea-weedy" like wakame does.  It's great in as a soup stock because it enhances the flavor of the other ingredients.  (Kombu contains natural sodium glutamate)  Because kombu is dried, it stays good in the cabinet for a very long time.  It's probably a good food to have in an earthquake kit as long as it's kept dried.  Unlike many of the other Kombu seaweed's for sale on Amazon that come from the coast of China (such as Emerald Cove), this slightly pricier Eden brand comes from the coast of Japan where the ocean water is cleaner.  (On Eden's website they say that this kombu is wild harvested from the Arctic current waters of Hokkaido, Japan)  I've also successfully made flavor-enhanced oatmeal by cutting it up with kitchen scissors into my oatmeal, nicely blending the flavors with the walnuts, pecans, raisins, and cranberries.  Kombu is a staple of the Japanese diet and you can find a large number of great cookbooks that will show you how to use it.  Considering that most older Americans are deficient in B vitamins, this is a simple and cost effective way to improve you diet.

review/text: I drink a lot of diet decaf iced tea and had difficulty finding it in the local supermarkets. When I did find it I had to pay almost $5.00 per bottle. By ordering it through Amazon I can get 6 jars every month (or whenever I want it) on automated delivery and the price is down around $3.50 per bottle. That's great in these tough times when every penny seems to make a difference! This is a great way to have a ready supply and not worry about going to the store and not finding any, and the delivery is FREE! Thanks Amazon!!!

review/text: Each jar makes 10 quarts, or 2.5 gallons, and costs $23.48 / 6, or $3.91 per jar. So this comes out to $1.57 per gallon.<br /><br />Crystal Light makes a similar tea mix, in tubes of pre-measured little tubs:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E55XOI">Crystal Light Iced Tea Decaffeinated Lemon Natural Flavor, 1.5-Ounce Canister (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />The little pre-measured tubs make Crystal Light more convenient than the Lipton jars, and CL is slightly cheaper at $1.54 / gallon. However, I personally like the Lipton flavor more; it tastes more like "real" tea.

review/text: I found a jar of this on a clearance end aisle at Target and thought, "Caffeine free, diet and lemon flavor....yum!". I think it took me 4 days to finish off the jar and when I went to the store I couldnt find it anywhere! And I have looked in 8 stores! Luckily, Amazon came through again and I can have this delivered every month with my subscription! I am trying to cut back on caffeine and I was getting bored with Raspberry Ice Crystal Light(yeah, plain water doent taste good to me unless its very hot or after 2pm) and this really hits the spot to sip on all day.

review/summary: I love this tea!
review/text: I have always enjoyed drinking Lipton Diet Instant Tea with Lemon.  When I quite drinking products that contain caffeine I had to stop buying this product.  I couldn't believe it when I saw a jar of my favorite iced tea mix without caffeine.  I started to buy the Lipton's on a regular basis.  One day it was gone.  I had to find another source to buy my iced tea so I went right to Amazon.  Not only do they carry the Lipton's Decaf iced tea mix but it cost LESS than the store price.  It is on the Super Saver list so with another purchase I have it shipped free.  It comes six in a box and it only takes a few days to recieve.  Thanks Amazon for giving me a little piece of iced tea heaven!<br /><br />Lipton Diet Decaf Instant Tea with Lemon is the perfect combination of tea, sweetner and lemon.  You add it to water then put some ice in the glass and you're done.  A delicious glass of iced tea!  You can also make it in larger quanties.  The formula is on the jar.  The jar is made of glass so it can be recycled.  Just one more thing to love.

review/summary: This stuff rocks and I'll never be without it...
review/text: Lipton diet decaf lemon tea mix rocks. I used to drink ALOT of soda or do you say 'pop'...anyway, this is a great replacement. I wanted to get off the caffeine without going bland. The reason I opted for Amazon to deliver this to my door is simple. My local grocer does have it on sale every so often, but when it's not, it is expensive! I mean the price goes up to $5-6 per jar. With Amazon, I get a constant $3.50 per jar supply. The delivery guy shows up at my door once a month and sets me up with a new supply (you can choose other timing schemes). It is packed expertly (good since they still use glass jars). The boxes are firm, non-descript and come with air bag padding. So recycle and use the box when you need to send something! Hey, it's a WIN-WIN happenin' here!

review/summary: Aspartame is Poison
review/text: I recently discovered the debate over Aspartame, and have decided the most cautious thing to do would be to switch to an Unsweetened Instant Ice Tea (there is one available here on Amazon<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M050C0">Nestea Instant Decaf Unsweetened Tea, 3-Ounce Unit (Pack of 4)</a>.)  Without going to deeply into it, it took the pharmaceutical giant that created Aspartame 16 years to get the FDA to approve it after years of refusing on the grounds that is toxic.  Political pressure prevailed over science and health concerns and the product was approved.  This doesn't make the product any safer than it was when the FDA thought it was toxic.  Read about it for yourself, I'm going with unsweetened and adding natural sweeteners to it.  Cheers.
