review/summary: Pamela's is the best!
review/text: Pamela's Products are by far the best gluten free option in terms of baked goods.  These cookies are fantastic!  The flavor is terrific and there are big chunks of semi-sweet chocolate and walnuts.  While I do miss the soft, chewy texture of non gluten free cookies, this product is the best is its category.  I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Oh, my!
review/text: I'm new to eating GF and have lost so many other foods from my diet because of migraines.......I'm trying this now. Have read much about how we can become Gluten Sensitive later in life; also, studies have shown that gluten can be a migraine trigger for many and is an inherited tendency, which would figure into my family history of migraines.<br />Eating Gluten Free isn't nearly as difficult as I'd expected.  There are so many wonderful foods on the market for us.  My first impression of this cookie....Heavenly! Big chunks of chocolate, walnuts scattered throughout, delicate but not crumbly, not overpoweringly sweet.  I got them on subscribe and save, and my only issue will be not eating them all before the next shipment arrives. I'm saving my daily cookie for mornings with my Toasted Nut Brulee tea.  Ummmmm!

review/summary: Good Gluten Free Choc Chips w/Walnuts
review/text: I have tried many of Pamela's GF cookies.  These are one of my faves, tied with the organic chocolate choc chip.  Like most GF confections, they aren't quite what grandma made, but they fill the bill when I'm looking for a cookie.  And they are great with dairy free/GF ice cream (well frozen creamy stuff!) And if you call Pamela, you get real people on the phone!!

review/summary: Unique & Delicious!
review/text: I purchased this carbonated lemonade at a local health food store on a whim and I love it.  I've had Mediterranean rose water lemonade before which I liked but it did not have ginger root nor was it carbonated which adds a lot of zing.  Also, this lemondade is botanically brewed and has distilled essential oil of rose.  The rose oil seems to bring out layers or dimensions of flavor from the lemon and the ginger.  It's very refreshing and very unique!<br /><br />Ingredients are as follows:<br />Carbonated Water, Lemon Juice Concentrate, Cane Sugar, Glucose Syrup, Fermented Ginger Root Extracts (ginger root, water and yeast), Pear Juice Concentrate, Lemon Flavoring, Citric Acid, Tantaric Acid, Natural Color (grape skin extract), and Rose Oil.<br /><br />The Fentimans Victorian Rose Lemonade isn't cheap, but it's worth it for a treat.  Definitely a more sophisticated "soda" for the less processed palate (Sprite and Mountain Dew lovers need not apply - lol - you may not like it!).  It adds so much to a meal... even as a dessert!

It is a softer type of rice....not as firm as some rice can be, but I prefer this type.

review/text: I used to drink a lot of soda pop until I started having problems with calories. Then I switched to diet sodas. After drinking such beverages for years, I was finally convinced that diet sodas weren't doing me any good. Whether they were harmful is open to debate. In any case, I'll still drink a diet soda if nothing else is available and I don't worry any about it. However, I discovered the Crystal Geyser flavored spring water and enjoyed it very much. I first tried the lemon and lime and the latter was my favorite. More recently, I picked up a case of the Orange. It's good! It has a nice zesty carbonation and a nice very light orange taste. I like it ice cold. It goes real well with meals and the 18-ounce bottle is just the right size.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Don't like taste, but do like medicinal qualities
review/text: Out of curiosity, I chose to purchase this particular flavor of Two Leaves and a Bud at my local grocer.  I do not like the taste of the tea without sweetner -- it is very bitter even when using a lower temp for the water (because its green tea) and this is the first time I've ever tasted a green tea that I didn't care for -- The Two Leaves and a Bud Jasmine Green is divine!  With sweetener, the Orange Sencha Green is tolerable (for me).  What I like about this green tea is its medicinal effects.  On the back of all Two Leaves & A Bud packages are brief statements listing what types of foods the teas pair with and/or what the tea is "best for."  The Orange Sencha Green Tea states that it is best for concentration ... and it is.  If I'm feeling particulary foggy headed or out of sorts (lol), I drink a mug of Orange Sencha Green and it clears my head right up!  I appreciate teas that have effective medicinal qualities that are evident within a few sips and this makes up for the unpleasant (my opinion) taste.  I will continue to purchase it and would recommend it as a good reading or studying tea.

Once I experienced it, I drove back the very next morning and bought the remaining inventory they had to enjoy and share with friends. Several months later after running out, I went to the company's website in Aspen Colorado and ordered some more.<br /><br />When I ran out again, they were kind enough to inform me that I could order it from Amazon and that it would qualify for Amazon's awesome free shipping. What an amazing deal. Thanks to everyone at Two Leaves and a Bud and Amazon for their insight to carry such a great product.<br /><br />Bt the way... This is "Whole Leaf Green Tea" and the tea bags are adorable sachets versus the paper type you get with everyone else. Top drawer stuff. You actually savor every last drop.

review/text: I debated a little about whether or not to order just because the reviews are so split down the middle. But I'm a big fan of other Two Leaves and a Bud varieties so I decided I had to give it a fair try. I'm glad I did! I prepared it with warm water, just the same as I do with all green tea, and it turned out really nicely. It's got a light smooth flavor & just a hint of orange. With just a little bit of stevia, it was perfect. I am not a sencha aficionado, so I cannot make a thorough comparison to other sencha teas. But I have been drinking a variety of green teas for a long time and can definitely say it stacks up to the other nice greens that I've had. It's also really refreshing iced so I recommend giving it a try that way this summer as well!

So far this one, and Celestial Seasonings Raspberry are the only two I can stand. I have tried Zhena's green teas, and other brands, but I like this one best. I add a teensy bit (1/4 teaspoon) of Organic Agave for sweetening, and I'm good to go. The bags are elegant, and I love the orange aroma of this tea. I also enjoy Two Buds Earl Grey and their Assam (with almond milk, yum). I wish that other reviewer who disliked this flavor would send me his/her box of 100! I'll drink it. Maybe if you're a purist Green Tea person, this one is too flavored; but like I said, my uneducated palate loves it.

review/summary: Hideous over-powering orange flavor
review/text: Well, where to begin.<br /><br />First, I have been drinking tea (green, black, oolong, white, etc.) for more than 15 years as either loose leaf (whole leaf) or bagged. My number one love is green tea ... specifically Japanese Sencha. I have consumed many grades and types of steaming (mild, medium and "deep"). I have also tried many of the products offered by "Two Leaves and a Bud" by way of Whole Foods (who do not offer this).<br /><br />This is the first offering by Two Leaves that I sadly have to say is dreadful. Before you think I'm a jerk, let me say that they offer some awesome bagged teas. This just isn't one of them (IMHO).<br /><br />The orange that they add KILLS all of the beauty that the Sencha could potentially offer. What's worse is they suggest a steeping time of 4-minutes. Ludicrous. Most mild steamed (which this is) or medium steamed Sencha's steep for no more than 3-minutes. Four minutes will produce an acrid bitter brew unless the Sencha is a superior grade (which this doesn't appear to be).<br /><br />Even after steeping this for about 3 minutes, the taste is still overwhelmingly sharp & "bitty" (just a weaker sharp). I can not believe that the people at Two Leaves have ever had a good cup of loose leaf Sencha. I can't. If they have, they wouldn't offer this.<br /><br />I can only assume they add so much orange to it because the Sencha grade is poor. Otherwise, why not sell it without the orange flavor like the wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGZKWM">Two Leaves and a Bud, Tamayokucha Extremely Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100 Count</a> they offer? The Tamayokucha is excellent! No orange flavor needed, and I bet none is needed here either.<br /><br />Bummer is that I was dumb enough to buy the 100 count box (my bad). There is no way I can drink the rest of it and I would feel horrible if I gave it away to someone. They would think I had no taste in teas.<br /><br />My advice: buy a single box of this first. If you like it, switch to coffee.

review/text: First, I can say these cookies are very easy to prepare and I am proud to say I made all 6 units without a single failed batch. :)  So they are basically fool-proof as long as one follows the instructions.<br /><br />The cookies do not flatten a lot while baking, so I was able to fit more per cookie sheet than normal -- about 16 cookies on a 13x18 cookie sheet vs. the typical 12.  In fact, if you drop the dough on the cookie sheet and don't flatten it a little, you will end up with cookie mounds.  Uneven edges around each cookie will remain so -- these do not flatten out into smooth-edged discs.  The texture reminds me of homemade oatmeal cookies, actually.<br /><br />I realized after the first batch I didn't even need to butter the cookie sheet. I use aluminum bakeware yet the finished cookies came off the un-buttered sheets as if they had a non-stick coating (they don't).  I typically baked the cookies for about 14 minutes and they were soft and moist but set.  At 15 min. they were still soft, not quite as moist but not dry.<br /><br />Second, I admit I wasn't sure I liked the taste much at first. The one thing I could definitely pinpoint about the taste after the first batch was that they seemed too salty.  So for all subsequent batches I used unsalted butter and this was a big improvement.  These do not taste the same as non-GF cookies, IMO, yet they are pretty good (very good with milk) and for me they did satisfy chocolate-chip-cookie cravings**.<br /><br />**These cookies have far more chocolate chips/chunks than I find in typical cookie mixes, which helps with my evaluation, I'm sure. :)

review/summary: Excellent gluten-free & wheat-free cookie mix!
review/text: I had to admit I was skeptical about how these cookies would taste; it seems that anything using non-traditional baking supplies never really tastes right to me.  I can detect even the slightest variation, too, and therefore usually end up throwing out gluten-free products.<br /><br />Fortunately, this chocolate chunk cookie mix by Pamela's is as tasty as cookies made with white flour!  They have a good chocolate flavor and nice consistency; and are not grainy like I worried they might be.<br /><br />You just add one egg and 8 tablespoons of softened butter; mix for about a minute, then scoop into little mounds on a cookie sheet, and bake.  True that the cookies do turn out a bit darker than chocolate chip cookies made with white processed flour, but these taste just as good.<br /><br />Each package makes about one dozen cookies.  Fresh out of the oven - these are great!

review/summary: Subscribe and Save delivers OLD bags of mix!  Two thumbs down
review/text: I've subscribed to receive Pamela's GF cookie mix and after the second delivery of OLD mixes I am returning to buying them in the store.  All of the last mixes during the last several months (6 bags per order x 2 = 12) have been OLD -- not expired, but the chocolate is dried up, light brown and crumbles to a powder.  I discovered it's not possible to return a subscribe 'n save order (for some reason) so I have to throw out the chocolate chips and use Ghiradelli instead.  Whenever I have bought Pamela's from Whole Foods the chocolate in the mix has been dark brown, fresh and never has crumbled to powder.<br /><br />AVOID subscribe and save on this item.  Buy them in a store.

review/text: Living gluten-free for several years now, it's been a while since I had any "real" chocolate chip cookies.  But, I don't remember them being even close to as good as what comes from this mix. They're incredibly easy to make (though we only cook them just over half the time as directed), and even my non-gluten-free family is hooked.

review/text: I love these cookies.  You just mix them all up in a bowl together and bake.  I ADD MORE CHOCOLATE chips- at least 1/4 cup more of whatever flavor I am craving at the time- or better yet chop up some chunks from a semisweet baking bar!  This makes it better, I think, as it doesn't have enough chocolate in them when I really need a chocolate fix.  The package says  to melt the butter.  You do not have to do that if you have a hand mixer with some guts.  Just use soft butter or butter substitute.  Also, watch how long they cook as mine never need the full time.  My kids like them softer so I bake shorter for them and make a crispier tray for me.  The only caveat is that each bag only makes a small batch and it is expensive.  BUT this is the BEST tasting gluten free mix I have ever found.  My kids love them and they are eaten quickly.

review/text: These are very good, and so easy!  Plus, I never fail to be impressed at how CHOCK-FULL they are of chocolate chunks.  No skimping here.  I order it through Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" program, which makes these a very good deal indeed.  What makes these cookies an even BETTER deal is that you can make them healthier by substituting ingredients.  This mix calls for one egg and 1 stick of butter.  Instead, I use the egg and a generous 1/4 c. peanut butter plus a generous 1/4 c. plain yogurt (and a bit of water as-needed for consistency).  No butter necessary.  They still come out good, and I feel even better about them.  Eat & ENJOY!

review/summary: Delicious but makes a difference on what you bake them
review/text: I prepared one batch by hand according to recipe using butter.  I baked 1/3 of the batter on glass, 1/3 on corningware, and 1/3 on baking sheet.  The glass batch turned out best.  The corningware batch flattened a little more than the glass batch and also was more crumbling.  The baking sheet ones tasted burnt although they didn't look burnt; the baking sheet ones looked similar to the glass batch but tasted burnt and I threw them out.  I don't know of any other gluten-free chocolate chip cookie mix that is also potato free and this one tastes great.  Reminds me of the duncan hines regular glutened-mix but not as good as the recipe on the back of Tollhouse cookies glutened cookies.<br /><br />Another very similar mix I like a little better is Authentic Foods Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix which AF just came out with and since Amazon carries AF, hopefully they will carry the Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix soon.  The ingredients for them is:  Rice Flour, Organic Granulated Can Juice, Dark Chocolate Chunks (granulated can juice, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, dextrose, soy lecithin, vanilla), Natural vanilla flavor, salt, baking soda, soy lechitin - Gluten-free Wheat-free May contain milk & soy  To mix add 2 eggs, 3 oz veg oil and 1 oz water.  Bake 10-15min at 375.  The Authentic Foods Chocolate Chunk Cookie holds together a little better than Pamela's.  The AF cookie has a more buttery taste whereas Pamela's has a more cocoa taste to the cookie.  I think they both get their chocolate chunks from the same supplier as they seemed identical so it is just the cookie part to compare!

review/summary: Delicious---just don't eat all of the batter first!
review/text: Although I love to cook, I rarely if ever bake due to a health condition. I probably have hypoglycemia---I haven't taken the definitive three-tiered test to determine if I have the condition (after fasting, you are given a drink of pure liquid glucose, and then your blood sugar is measured three times over the next several hours); however, when my doctor had me fast for twelve hours on two occasions, then measured my blood sugar level, my readings were below normal the first time and at the very low end of normal the second time. He gave me the preliminary diagnosis of hypoglycemia and warned me not to eat concentrated sugar.  The third time I had my blood-sugar tested, I had avoided concentrated sugar for a whole week, then fasted for twelve hours, and my blood-sugar reading was very normal at 90. I probably also have Candida, which is a very annoying and difficult-to-get-rid-of condition. My Candida tests showed that I have Candida, yet the readings were not high enough to merit a prescription to get rid of it (a Catch-22). Candida thrives on sugar and acidic foods. Therefore, added sugar and I are not friends, and I try to avoid the addictive stuff to the best of my willpower's ability.<br /><br />Yet I was craving homemade chocolate chip cookies last week. I haven't eaten, much less made, chocolate chip cookies in a few years! One of my friends who also has Candida (be careful of antibiotics---they can mess up your body's flora, and avoid sugar while on antibiotics and for a good few weeks after you finish taking your course of antibiotics---a lesson I learned a little too late!) said that if I ever do indulge my sweet tooth, take a TBS of Raw Apple Cider Vinegar beforehand, and it will help keep your body alkaline and therefore, offset the sugar.  I also take Cinnamon capsules or New Chapter Cinnamon gel caps to help with my blood sugar.  (If I don't take all of these precautionary pre-sugar ingesting steps, my facial dermatitis will flare up for a good three weeks, and I'll look and feel just awful.  Nothing makes you feel more unpretty than red patches of inflamed skin.  Gluten, or at least refined glutinous grain, also seems to exacerbate my dermatitis condition.) So I was stoked when I saw a gluten-free chocolate chip cookie mix in the Natural Department of a local grocery store.  I didn't feel like spending a lot of money and time chasing down organic chocolate chips, non-gluten flour, organic vanilla extract, etc. to make the cookies I was craving.<br /><br />Although I was happy to see this mix and give it a try, I honestly didn't think they'd taste especially good---enough to satisfy my craving and then I'd move on.  O Contraire.  These cookies are beyond delicious! As a person who is passionate about cooking, I can't help but mess with a recipe, even when it's already prepared for me in a mix and I only have to add an egg and butter (or in my case, a combo of Earth Balance Organic Coconut Spread and Goat's Milk butter).  I added a small amount of crushed walnuts, crushed Brazilian nuts, a spoonful of raw almond butter, and a light dusting of Cinnamon, Ground Jamaica Allspice, and Coriander Seed.  The result?  Amazing!  (I added the nuts, almond butter, and spices because I thought that that would help moderate the cookies' concentrated sugar.)  Another nice thing about this prepared mix is that it would be great for a vegan, which I briefly was (I still remain an adamant "cruelty-free" vegetarian), and then vegans can use applesauce for the egg and Earth Balance for the butter requirements.<br /><br />The only problem--I don't want to eat added sugar on a regular basis.  Definitely believe we should all really, really limit sugary foods, only as a special occasions treat.  These cookies make my resolution to avoid added sugar a bit more challenging.  Yet my chocolate chip cookie craving is satiated for the time being.

review/summary: Soooo tasty!
review/text: Admittedly, I am a bit skeptical about gluten-free products. Most pale in comparison to the 'real' version they are trying to mimic. While this cookie mix probably couldn't go head-to-head with 'real' cookies per most peoples' standards, it certainly does for me. The mix is fool-proof and easy enough for children to make--you don't need an electric mixer at all--just mix by hand. You can add extra goodies too, though they are already very generous with the chocolate chunks. Walnuts or your favorite nut or fruit makes awesome additions.<br /><br />As for flavor, these guys are -tasty-. I really like the cocoa in the mix and although there's actually not a whole lot of sugar in them (6 g of sugar per cookie is -nothing- compared to other mixes and premade cookies), the cookies are very sweet. I've made, and served, them to regular cookie eaters (who are not gluten-free) and everyone has loved them.<br /><br />You can make these cookies more interesting by substituting coconut oil (which is full of 'good' fat and MCTs) for the butter. Do so at your discretion though---I love the taste (especially when combined with macadamia nuts), but it is certainly a subjective area. Also, as a warning, the cookies come out pretty crumbly if baked for the time specified on the packaging. I did not cook mine for the entire time suggested and remove them from the pan shortly after removing them from the oven. This has prevented any sticking and crumbling issue.<br /><br />All in all, I really like this mix and hope everyone who can't eat 'normal' cookies enjoys it too!

review/text: I have a wheat allergy and have tried just about every type of gluten and wheat free cookie mix out there. I have to say that this cookie mix is a-m-a-z-i-n-g and the BEST.<br /><br />Prep and Baking:<br />Super easy, you add butter and an egg, that's it. You want to bake them until the bottom of the cookie is a light brown, be sure not to over bake. I knew they would taste good, as even the dry mix was super yummy, not overly sweet, but more buttery and chocolaty tasting.<br /><br />Texture:<br />The texture of these cookies is so light and fluffy; they simply melt in your mouth. They also have the perfect combination of an ever so slight chewiness and a hint of crunch. Basically they look and feel just like a "real" chocolate chip cookie.<br /><br />Taste: These cookies are not overly sweet, which I really like. They have more of a delicious, rich, buttery / chocolaty taste, with a good amount of dark chocolate chunks throughout, simply perfect.<br /><br />CONS: As someone who does not like to over indulge in sweets and focuses on eating healthy, I normally bake and share. The con is I found it hard to part with these yummy cookies, as I wanted them all for myself.

I have yet to find one I did not think was wonderful.  Back to the chocolate chunk cookies.  This mix has huge pieces of dark chocolate and is delicious.  Some of the reviews that I have read state that it has too much sugar.  Yes it does, as all real chocoate chip cookies do.  I am a health nut myself, but when I want an occasional indulgence this is it.

review/text: Although its always nice to find gluten free products available to those who suffer from Celiac Disease, its also troubling to find many of these products also are high in sugar. I found this to be extremely too sweet for my taste. If I purchase something that is chocolate I want to taste chocolate not be overwhelmed by sugar.Rice flour in itself is high glycemic and with the added sugar this product made me feel ill from the sugar content. I have been baking for years the old fashioned way with whole wheat but after developing Celiac I no longer could consume it. I learned later from a nutritionist that sugar was also a problem for people who have Celiac. Through trial and error I found this to be so true. Can't the makers of these mixes back off on the sugar? I removed the chips as well as they were too sweet. Other than that its okay for a rice flour mix cause we all know rice does not compare to whole wheat.

review/text: We usually have a case of Orville Redenbacher Microwave Popcorn in the pantry for snacks. We prefer such things as popcorn and nuts much better than candy, and I think they are much better for you. It, after all, is just corn with a few flavors and we try to keep the flavoring to a minimus. Plus, it has a lot of fiber. The popping is perfect every time. We just set our microwave on "popcorn" and it comes out just fine with no further adjustment. We bought this 40-pack box of Orville Redenbacher's Smart Pop at our local Costco warehouse store. We expect it will provide good snacks, have a good shelf life and last a long time.<br /><br />I might add, our young boy (three) just loves to go over to nearby Lake Murray and feed the ducks, coots and geese. We pop up a couple bage of microwave popcorn and let him stroll around and feeding the birds. He loves it. The birds seem to enjoy it too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Caution, do not accept bad tasting popcorn.
review/text: Watch out, we had a couple of bad tasting bags from a 40-count box from costco recently.  When opening up the third, many of the popcorn kernels inside were odd looking, inconsistent.  It is too bad, so now we are going to air popped popcorn, after using Orville's  bags nearly daily for a few years.  Eden's organic popcorn was OK so far, but harder to find.  Now will try Bob's (red mill?) popcorn kernels.  Hoping none of these are of the genetically modified type of corn.

review/summary: Thank you for carrying this USA made item
review/text: About two years ago we bought a product from China at Costco that was "dog chews".<br />I have an Australian Shepard that can chew up anything, and she ate the Costco chews and was literally coughing up blood.<br />I couldn't imagine it was the product, after all Costco is a good store.<br />We took her to the vet and she checked out fine.<br />So a month later the dog had been fine, decided to try again. Same Result, once sick dog, blood coming out of her mouth.<br />The chews did not cut her. We took her to the vet and he could find no reason for her to be bleeding, it was coming up from her throat. I called and reported this to a lot of people and heard from them similar stories. Only thing that bothered me was Costco didn't seem to care and didn't respond to our calls and letters, which were courteous, we didn't blame their store, just wanted them to know the product they were selling was harmful.<br /><br />Made me very upset that I was so stupid to trust anything from China, and especially that I gave it to my dog again. I still feel very badly about it, and have not bought ANYTHING from China since that day, nothing, not cloths or shoes, nothing. Makes it hard to shop in Wally-world.<br /><br />Thank you for carrying these products.

review/text: My husband's 86 year old father set us with the task of finding him some turtle soup.  When an 86 year old asks for something you make sure to find it!  We assumed that since we live in Louisiana, where seafood is plentiful, this would be an easy task.  We were very surprised when we could not find it anywhere locally.  When I have trouble finding something I always turn to my reliable friend, Amazon.com, and tada it is found.  I must admit that I was a little surprised that it seemed a bit pricey but after researching turtle soup I realized that it is priced right. I ordered the 6 pack and had it shipped directly to my father-in-law.  He was overjoyed when his package arrived and tried it immediately.  He was very pleased with the taste.  I am sure I will be placing another order for this product sometime in the near future.

review/text: As a long-ago Philadelphian, I never lost my taste for snapper soup.  I was happy to find this product under the brand of Bookbinder's, an old and well-respected Philly restaurant, and I bought a case.  Unfortunately, the soup doesn't taste anything like what it's supposed to.  It's bitter, and has an off-smell and -taste.  The few small bits of turtle are hard to find.  The soup itself had the consistency of paste, and didn't taste much better.  I ate this stuff just because I was taught not to waste food, but it was a struggle.  I guess I'll have to wait until I visit the city for some of the real stuff.  You should, too.

review/summary: Addicting - if you crave the orange/chocolate combination
review/text: I've been addicted to these bars for some years, buying them at a local supermarket, and breaking off a square now and then through the day as a treat.  The orange flavoring complements the creamy medium cacao (54%) chocolate wonderfully. If you are an orange-chocolate fan, melt a square in your mouth and enjoy.  I find the orange flavoring superior to that of other organic chocolate bars with orange flavor or bits of orange zest.  If you want a truly dark chocolate taste, you'll have to look elsewhere though.<br /><br />(I came across these bars after my favorite treat was no longer distributed in the US - a much darker organic chocolate covering bitter orange/orange-zest jellies.  They were killer good.  While this doesn't compare, it mostly satisfies my orange-chocolate cravings.)

Took a while to get it shipped (two weeks or so on free shipper program). Recommend it for the lovers of fine organic products.

review/summary: A great fix for the price
review/text: There is nothing like fresh roasted chestnut.  But when these are not available, the French roasted chestnuts that come in a jar are typically the second best alternative but cost more than two and a half time these and do not have single serve packages.  These are the best alternative for a quick snack.  The drawback:  They are smaller, very dark and look very unappetizing although the taste is fine, but the only thing that makes me yearn for the French chestnuts is their moisture content.  Either the manufacturer is roasting these incompletely so they weigh more roasted than the French equivalent, or they must have problem with the manufacturing technique, or pack them while warm, increasing the moisture content in the bag.  At time they can be even sticky to the fingers.  Would I buy them again? Yes.  If money was no issue would I buy them? No.  I would buy the French roasted chestnuts in the glass jars. Better yet, I would have a maid roast them for me and peal them. LOL

review/summary: Awful Texture and Taste
review/text: Ordered Galil Roasted Chestnuts after watching a Dr Oz show.  We expected that the word roasted was referring to something similar to dry roasted.  Instead we found that they are a wet soft mushy nut.  Horrible tasting. We couldn't eat even one complete nut much less 24 pouches. Strongly would recommend that all future buyers beware of trying something in quantity that you have not tried before.

review/summary: Just okay.
review/text: They were okay.  I can't rave about them or hate them, but having had them fresh from the shell, I can definitely tell the difference.  They don't have as much taste to them (they're rather bland, actually), and they're smaller than the fresh ones I've bought.  However, they're not bad-tasting, and you don't have to mess around with shelling them.  That's one thing that keeps me from getting fresh ones more than once or twice when they're in season!<br /><br />I don't think I would use these in a recipe unless I was in a pinch, because of the bland mushiness to them, but they're just fine for snacking.  I would recommend that you try these out if you see them in the store, and then if you like them go ahead and order the 24 pouch pack.<br /><br />Give them a try.  You might like them.

review/summary: Slimey and disgusting!
review/text: My initial taste of these roasted chestnuts were positive!  However, after a week, the remaining chestnusts in the ziplock bag turned slimey and is covered with an unappetizing goo.  I had to throw away the rest of the bag for fear of spoilage.  DO NOT BUY!

review/summary: AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL
review/text: I bought these because of the good reviews and I now think the reviews came from employees or some such thing.  They are not the color of chestnuts, plus they are wet in the package and the taste and texture is way off.  I had to order 24 packs of them and they are not-returnable and yet I cannot even finish the first pack.  I would really suggest either get your chestnuts fresh and roast them yourselves or do without because if you are like me who has been roasting and enjoying for 50+ years you will be terribly disappointed.

review/summary: The most disgusting thing I have ever tasted...
review/text: Plus they would not accept returns after I opened them...BEWARE of these.  I was expecting something that resembled a chestnut but it tasted like moldy gunk.  If there were negative stars, this product would receive negative...<br />Make sure you purchase directly from Amazon because the other sellers don't allow returns.  I had to throw the whole case of 24 away.

review/text: Order full box, tastes horrible. No one will eat it, brought it to the office, few people tried it and spit it out. Bought it because of reviews, hopefully no one else buys it.

review/text: This Galil Roasted Chestnuts are undoubtedly the worse product I have ever ordered from Amazon.  I literally threw them away.  Not edible by me.

review/summary: Good buy!
review/text: I'd been looking for whole wheat orzo for awhile, and it's almost impossible to find in any grocery stores. This is a very great pasta at a reasonable price. I've been very pleased with this pasta. One thing - If you are accustomed to the enriched wheat (non-whole grain) orzo, this is a lot firmer - and another thing I've noticed is that It develops a grainy texture if I leave a pasta in the fridge overnight.

review/summary: Found, at last.
review/text: I have been looking for this whole wheat orzo for the last year and none of my area grocery stores carry it. So I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  It is very tasty made with sauteed green onions and several cloves of garlic and then added to 14 oz. boiled chicken broth and then simmered for 15 mins. (using 1 cup of the orzo).  Very yummy tasting and good for you too.
