review/summary: Delicious Cookies, But Way Overpriced
review/text: Every year we pick up several tins of these cookies to give as Christmas gifts.  This is a large tin which features a nice variety of cookies covered in both white and dark chocolate.  I especially love the taste of the white Belgian chocolate coupled with the cookies.<br /><br />Yummy cookies, but these are way overpriced here.  Last year around Christmas time we purchased approximately ten tins of these cookies at our local Costco and they only cost us $10 per tin, so please check prices locally before purchasing them here.

review/text: Excellent quality on these cookies. Both the wafer/shortbread part and the chocolate are top-notch. I have been to England and have had biscuits (what they call cookies there), and these are of similar quality to high end ones bought there. One word of warning: as they are covered in real chocolate without added wax and other junk, they melt onto your fingers while holding them rather quickly, so little kids will likely make a bit of a mess when they eat them.

review/text: I first had one of these cookies at work where we were given a box to share.  After trying a cookie (well actually a few cookies) I decided I had to find out the brand and try to locate them for myself.  I found them on Amazon and purchased 2 boxes, these come with 2 layers so during the holidays I separated them and took to different functions.  Everywhere they traveled with me, they received rave reviews.  These are a very rich European chocolate. I will continue to purchase these cookies as long as I can get them.  My family also had fun trying all 15 varieties - one right after the other!

This is not your typical out-of-a-tin cookie.The "belgian" marbled white and milk chocolate on the cookies make them incredibly delectable. Nothing dry or boring here. I am trying to stay away from this shiny red box this year! Note that recipients will see the word "Kirkland" and may know it's made by the Sam's club people. But once they taste the cookies, they won't care!

review/summary: Inaccurate ingredient label inside
review/text: Our family received the EUROPEAN COOKIES with Belgian Chocolate (Item 181679)as a holiday gift.  They were left in the tin and served to our guest at a family dinner party. The guest trying them noted that they were extremely rich and some commented favorably on the taste.  My daughter, who has severe allergies wanted to try<br />one, but knowing that she is allergic to nuts, carefully read the label on the inside of the tin top that<br />displayed all the varieties.  She chose the "Creme Melody" because it was described as white chocolate over creme wafer.  After taking a test bite, she was okay, so she ate the entire cookie.  Minutes later she became<br />extremely ill and had to be rushed to the hospital by ambulance.  The trama it caused our family is unbelievable, but we thank God she lived and would not want anyone else who has nut allergies to try this product.

review/text: After trying other couscous from the Amazon site I did not have my hopes very high, but I was surprised that this brand is very good. The packaging is awkward though--it is not resealable. I don't understand the references to Israel in the product description. This is NOT Israeli (pearl) couscous. The grains are slightly larger than my supermarket brands and quickly re-hydrates without becoming sticky. It is definitely worth a try.

review/summary: Surprisingly great
review/text: This is actually really good couscous.<br /><br />Typically I just buy the stuff in my local supermarket in those little 20 oz buckets. It usually costs me around 8-9$ optimistically. This Osem North African couscous is a whopping 160 oz, for barely a few dollars more! The subscription allows me to buy a new bag every month for a substantially reduced rate, which is about how long I suspect this might last me. I'm a college kid and so my diet isn't very wholesome, but grains such as couscous and rice are extraordinarily cheap and together with multivitamins cover most of my dietary needs.<br /><br />Couscous is made from Durum wheat, and so contains more protein and less starches on average than rice, making it a more complete meal. I've often gone days eating only couscous due to budgetary concerns. For most normal people who might cook this once a week, this bag can probably last 3-6 months.<br /><br />I was concerned that the bag might come open and damaged due to a bad review I read on here, but I believe that was a special case. Careful opening of the package revealed an intact and well wrapped heavy bag of couscous. I might buy a few of these bags and just leave them sitting unopened in the closet; it makes a very good survival food because couscous can be made into an edible mush by just adding water and allowing it to sit, meaning that you could store this stuff indefinitely and consume it in a situation where you have no access to a heat source.<br /><br />And all that for 1/7th the price that I pay in a grocery store? Osem has my stomach.

As a person who wanted to learn to make cousocous (this would be my first time working with it), I wanted the original kind, as it is used traditionally, so I was/am a little disappointed with this choice.  I will still work with it, obviously, and it works out because it's summer here, but wanted to make sure people know this product is already cooked.<br /><br />Bag arrived with tape on it, so I hope there are no adverse effects.

review/text: The 10 lb bag of couscous cooks just as well as the expensive (all marketing) stuff at the store.<br /><br />The only problem with such a big and heavy bag is that it is likely to get a hole in it. When I received the bag, the crease in the middle on the back had already separated a bit. Not much came out nor got in from what I've seen so far (I'm only halfway down the bag, if that). I taped up the hole and hopefully that's the end of it.

review/text: I wanted the Israeli couscous that's like little 2 mm pearls. The product description for this couscous says it's medium size. Well, it's NOT little pearls, just tiny semolina grains like 'ordinary' couscous.<br /><br />However, it tastes good and is a very good price so good enough.

review/summary: A nice tasting couscous.
review/text: I dont find a lot of variation in the flavors of different brands of couscous overall, but the freshness is a noticeable factor, and this bag i received had some very fluffy, fresh tasting couscous. Outside of that, the only real significance to this brand that i noticed was the low price, made even lower as a subscribe and save item. If you eat a lot of couscous like we do, then this is an ideal purchase. The quality is there and the price is right. If you have any questions, dont hesitate to ask. Otherwise,<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Great taste and very easy to cook
review/text: I cook it with chicken broth or beef broth or just in hot salted buttery water and it is delicious.<br />I just boil the broth/water and pour it into the bowl where I have my couscous, already seasoned with pepper, salt and garlic powder(be careful not to pour too much liquid or it will become like a puree) let it simmer for 5 min and that's it!!<br />Great for last minute meal. I did not give a 5 stars because I like really fine grain and this is medium but that is just my taste. Overall, it is a very good choice, very reasonable price.

review/summary: Very good bargain
review/text: The bag came well sealed and no holes or rips.  Just boil your water, I added butter, your couscous and cover for 5 minutes.  Fluff and it's ready to serve.  So much quicker and easier than pasta or rice, and it's not like eating either of those, it's more like a fluffy grain.<br /><br />You can add flavored stock and spices if you would like a flavor to it.  I think it's good on it's own and what ever you serve with it, it takes on the flavor of your dish.  I took off one star because there was a slight off-taste to it on the first few bites that diminished after eating more of it.  I don't know if that's just how couscous is or what - I haven't eaten couscous in many years so can't remember.  I will use this whole bag, it's very nice for a quick side-dish.

review/text: I ordered this item from Amazon and it was shipped quickly and in perfect condition.  The couscous itself tastes great, cooks quickly, and is a good change up to the other more common starches that accompany meals(i.e. rice, pasta, etc.).  This is definitely a good value as compared to buying the smaller jars in grocery stores and being a dry product should have a long shelf life.

review/summary: Couscous belongs in your home, right next to the pasta and rice.
review/text: Couscous may sound exotic, and it may look exotic when you see it in those teeny tiny boxes in the grocery store for $3-4, but it's a wonderful semolina staple that no home should be without. I was shocked to find a 10 lb bag like this for only $13; it's a huge amount for not a lot of cash.<br /><br />I find it is easy and quick to prepare, and since it is unseasoned, it is extremely versatile. There are a million and four recipes calling for couscous on the internet, and Im sure even the pickiest of eaters could find something that appeals to them. Again, the price and amount of couscous allows for a lot of experimentation.<br /><br />My package of couscous came in a reasonable time and I had no problems with couscous spilled everywhere as some people have noticed. It seems to be quite fresh, and I would not hesitate to purchase this again.

review/text: This is an incredible buy if you like couscous. The bag holds 10 pounds, which is about 25 cups. I debated this purchase for a while because I was unsure how 'medium' grain couscous compared to what I normally get at the store. It seems pretty much the same to me. Will not hesitate to buy again. A ten pound bag is a bit unwieldy for day to day use, so I suggest getting a smaller container to store a pound or two at a time.

review/summary: What a deal!
review/text: I do alot of backpacking and hiking, and I heard about adding couscous to soup or adding berrys to it for breakfast. Its super fast because its already cooked just add hot water and some oil if you have it and bam. This stuff is like 80% carbs so its great for ultra light meals.<br /><br />It is terribly bland, alot like oatmeal or white rice. So add something to it like peanut butter and honey for breakfast or chicken noodle soup.

review/text: *****<br />This is a peanut butter you can feel truly good about eating AND about giving to your children. Look up "palm fruit oil" on the Internet...google it...it is extremely healthy...the base of this peanut butter. Note that there IS added sugar, but it is relatively little.<br /><br />I normally eat unsweetened peanut butter as well as other nut butters and find this lightly sweetened peanut butter a fantastic treat. Put a little of this on a whole grain cracker and you'll be in heaven! In my case, it satisfies my sweet tooth and I don't want more--say a rich dessert--and so I am thrilled to tolerate the slight amount of sugar for the huge amount of benefit.<br /><br />No matter if you are a commercial peanut butter consumer or a purist who loves unsweetened raw nut butters--you will find much to love here--ESPECIALLY after you research all of the benefits of palm fruit oil. My husband is a junk food and fast food man and he also loves this...<br /><br />Check Amazon for different prices and shipping options to make sure you get the best deal, as they vary wildly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

They are a perfect age for it, because they can handle the tear-pouch function.

review/text: These are some pretty tasty sardines. Very tender and not too salty. A bit too soft and bland for my taste, but that's just my taste. Nice for doctoring up with your own seasonings (a splash of extra virgin olive oil and a shake of hot sauce - yum! :) )<br /><br />It's also great to know that Crown Prince is now using BPA-free cans on their Brislings.<br />Unfortunately, Amazon seems to be shipping out old stock, and none of the boxes I received had the BPA-free sticker. I ended up calling Crown Prince, and they confirmed that the cans without the sticker are not BPA-free.<br />When I contacted Amazon about it, they said they could replace the product, but not confirm whether it was the right product or not. Alas, the replacement box was not BPA-free either. Fortunately, they were kind enough to refund my money, but I would have preferred they just ship me the product that they are advertising on this page!<br /><br />Hopefully Amazon will update their stock, because this is a great price! For those not concerned about BPA, I would recommend this product as an affordable source of some decent brislings.

review/summary: Nutrition information needed before purchasing
review/text: The sardines are tasty. However, if you're watching your protein and fats, I found that this product has half the protein and three and a half times the saturated fats as the Crown Prince  sardines in olive oil. And with more calories. Had Amazon shown the Nutrition Facts as printed on the package I would have been aware of the difference. As it was, I made the assumption that three oz of sardines were all the same. Oh, well, caveat emptor!

review/summary: Not great
review/text: I was not highly impressed with these sardines. Not a great taste, higher in fat and lower in protein than the ones packed in olive oil, BUT they are lower in sodium than most. Amazon is still the best place to buy them, but just make sure what you really want first. The two layer in olive oil have a much better flavor and texture and they are not that much more in price.

review/summary: my cat wont eat it.
review/text: i guess it is a matter of your cat's personal preference.  My cat, however, will not eat this for some reason.  Strange.  She used to eat royal canin from her previous owner.  I have been feeding her 9 lives dry cat food which she eats pretty well.  I've given her a trial of the purina one smartblends and she'll prefer that over 9 lives (but still eats both).  So tried this goodlife salmon version since it is one of the grocery store brands that has 2nd highest protein content and is all natural.  well, she'd rather starve than eat this....she'll eat the stale 9 lives over this.  :(  i sniffed this brand and it smells quite different from 9 lives and purina one....it reminds me of the cat food i used to feed my first cat back in 1989.  Weird, i know but it really does remind me of such.  Again, maybe this is just my cat, but just a heads up on this.  this isnt a purina brand but is manufactured by Mars corporation (yea, same company that makes Mars chocolate bars).

review/summary: THE BEST MINT TEA!
review/text: This is a really, really great tea. The peppermint is  refreshing, wholesome, and pure. No black tea or flavorings mixed in. The quality is there, its a 100% domestic USA made tea, and the scriptures make it all the more amazing. A welcome change from the yogi/new age boxes everywhere. I HIGHLY recommend this one and their other flavors: Cranberry, Peach, and Chai. Peppermint is especially great for calming allergies, throats, and upset tummies. You really can't go wrong with any of the Shepherd's teas.

review/summary: Green, Tropical Heaven
review/text: This is heaven.  So sweet.  So mild.  So green, so tropical, so delicious!<br /><br />I am on my second cup in an hour, and reviewing this right away instead of waiting to see how well it tolerates different temperatures and steep times because it is just so flipping good I had to tell you all right away.<br /><br />Did you ever try a tropical dried fruit mix?  This smells exactly like one of those, though the taste is a bit more mild.  There is no hint of bitterness in this tea (though admittedly I have only tried conservative steep times), and it doesn't taste as strong and grassy green as many of the green teas I like best.  The tropical flavor out-competes much of the green taste, but don't worry:  it's still there underneath.<br /><br />I bought this locally because I could smell the product through the box and it was on sale.  My coworkers can smell the tea I just brewed, ("Wow, that smells delicious!"), so I've been handing out tea bags at work.  No one else has brewed it yet, but I suspect I know what they'll say.<br /><br />I'm happy with the ingredients on the box, too:  all kinds of organic stuff followed with natural flavorings.  The box does say "excellent over ice," so I'll have to try that sometime.  I may have to wait until I buy the next box, as I suspect this one will be history before I get around to icing anything.<br /><br />Yum!  Hope you love it as much as I do.<br /><br />Added for the sake of completion:  This isn't as forgiving of a long steep as some of the greens I love.  If you catch the bag in time it's never bitter, but it *will* go bitter if you steep too long.  Also, although this is fully caffeinated in theory, it doesn't make me vibrate.  Caffeine and I don't get along too well, but I haven't noticed any negative reactions to this tea, so that's good news for me, and perhaps less great news for the caffeine fiends out there.

review/text: I love hummus and garlic so I thought these chips would be just right for me.  However, I did not like them because they taste like they are made with powder ingredients.  The reason for that is that they are ACTUALLY MADE WITH:  "GARBANZO FLOUR, GARLIC POWDER, ONION POWDER, SOY FLOUR, POTATO STARCH & CORN STARCH".  Hence the reason for the powdery taste.  Yuck!  But the good thing is that my dog likes them, but then she likes everything.

review/summary: Ok, but definately not the best sardines
review/text: I used to enjoy Crown Prince brand when I was growing up, so I went ahead and bought the 12 pack since I'm trying to increase my daily calcium intake.<br /><br />I found the sardines to be a bit too "mushy" and the vinegar in the mustard to be quite overpowering.  Also, one of the five boxes I opened so far had already partially split along the seam where you peel off the top and some of the contents had seeped out, suggesting possible spoilage.  It certainly isn't safe to eat from that can.  I plan to contact Crown Prince once I finish the twelve pack in case any more cans are partially open.<br /><br />I'll finish this pack, but I don't intend to buy any more of the Crown Prince in mustard and will experiment with a different brand instead.

review/summary: Usually mmm.
review/text: When I went on a totally crazy elimination diet to sort out some food allergies, I started looking for foods that I had never eaten before (that I definitely wasn't allergic to) to round out my menu.  I got the sardine idea from Dr. Mark Hyman, who touted them as a healthy addition to any diet.  I was sooooo scared to eat these things that I let the first sample box (from the health food store) sit in my cupboard for over a month before I worked up the courage to try a bite.  I actually think I started with the regular old sardines in olive oil.  The more bites I took, the more I liked them. Then I got brave and bought a box of these (with mustard) from the store.  Wow, even better.  They tasted so good, I went ahead and ordered the 12-pack on amazon.  I have also tried the other mustard sardines by crown prince (not sure what the difference is) and they are not as good.  Since my crazy diet ended (well..I'm still gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free..slightly crazy!) I've had these things on toast (gluten free) with tomatoes - mmmm..., with rice, and in a salad.  Very good.  I find the mustard to sardine ratio to be perfect most of the time, though some boxes seem to have slightly too much mustard.  While I was pregnant (had a baby 2 months ago) I did not want to even look at a box of these, but I plan on getting back to sardine-ville again soon.

After receiving the Fizzies I was excited because I wanted my Grandchildren to love them as much as I did. BUT I tasted mine as they were drinking theirs  and it just wasn't the same. They didn't have the fizz or bite is what I call it as they did when I was a child. My grandchildren will drink them but they add them as flavoring to Sprite or 7up. They are just OK not what I remembered them to be. I would suggest buying just one pack of these and, if you like them then maybe buying the bigger packages.

review/summary: Fizzies instant drink tablets
review/text: I loved Fizzies when I was a kid.  As I recall, they stopped making them because they contained cancer causing chemicals called cyclamates.  My daughter bought me a box of the new one's in root beer flavor and I was really looking forward to a retro experience.  This was the most God-awful thing I've ever drank.  It tasted nothing like root beer.  I would describe the taste as more like a really bad, chemically laced, unsweetened tea.  I ended up dumping it in the sink.  I would like to believe I've just lost my sense of taste in my middle age but I really don't think that is the problem.  These things just don't taste anything like the product that was out in the 60's and early 70's.  If the taste of your own urine wouldn't bother you, you might enjoy Fizzies.  Keep in mind that they contain Sorbitol which, in modest quantities can cause gas, bloating and assorted digestive ills.

If the price would go down to $3 a bar, I would purchase this from Amazon.  Otherwise, I think I will stick to my local Target's supply of Ghirardelli bars.
