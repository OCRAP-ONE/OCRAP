review/summary: Very bland and weak coffee
review/text: I will admit that I like strong flavorful but not burnt tasting coffee. I give four stars to the Tully House Blend, but this Breakfast Blend is quite weak.<br />After ordering fifty of them, my husband and I in desperation have been trying to use them up by putting a kcup on espresso setting and using 2-3 kcups on Expresso  as needed to fill up our coffee cup. I'm sure it's a  fine Kcup if you like weak coffee, but...

review/summary: Just Right for Me
review/text: I recently found this blend available at my local Walmart (sorry Amazon, but it had a great price). It is a light blend such as I prefer, and tastes wonderful.  I could not detect any aftertaste as you get with medium or dark coffee blends. I previously wrote a review for Green Mountain's Nantucket Blend which I recommended to those that prefer medium blends.  However, this particular blend is just right for me.  I highly recommend this blend to fellow Amazon customers that prefer light blends.

review/text: I had received a Keurig coffee maker for the holidays and have been hooked since. I am not a real strong coffee person so this morning blend is perfect. Consistant in flavor. The only reason I gave it a four is once you buy the machine you are basically locked into buying the cups.. It does have the reusable pod tho. I believe the prices could come down. In the store the prices are outrageous, but on Amazom they are reasonable somewhat..

review/summary: Good everyday coffee
review/text: I have usually ordered my K-Cups direct from Green Mountain, but thought I'd try Amazon's larger package and subscribe/save. The box of 50 works out to about a month's supply of coffee for me, with drinking a couple of cups a day.<br /><br />The taste is good--it's not a strong coffee, for that you need something like Green Mountain Coffee's Extra Bold.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PA30ZU">Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic (Extra Bold) K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers, 50-count</a><br /><br />It's not too heavy of a coffee, but none of the cups I have brewed have been the weak water that a few other reviews suffered from. Bad batches and bad quality control may be the issue.<br /><br />If you double-check the prices and get a good batch, it's a better than average cup of coffee.

review/text: I love this coffee.  I'm a fan of lighter roasts.  I like the lack of bitterness and higher caffeine that comes with them.  This one is my favorite.  For most K-Cups, even lighter roasts, I have to run the machine twice through one K-Cup to get a decent, not overly-strong, cup of coffee.  These come out perfect for me with one run.  I do tend to go through them more quickly because of that, but that's okay. The great coffee is worth it!

review/text: I knew there was something wrong when I opened the outer packaging from Amazon an it contained loose coffee grounds.  I found the Breakfast Blend box to be leaking the grounds.  When I opened it I found several of the K-cups had lids that were applied off-center, thus not sealing the K-cups and the grounds were spilling out.  I have used LOTS of K-cups and have NEVER seen this before.  Poor quality control by Green Mountain with this batch.  Shame on the folks at Amazon for packaging up a box that was obviously leaking it's goods.

review/summary: Love Green Mountain Breakfast Blend -- Great Coffee!!!!!
review/text: I just recently got my Keurig, and I've been trying the sample pack of coffee that came with it.  So far this is by far my favorite.  I nice mild coffee taste to enjoy in the morning or anytime.  I actually wish they made this coffee in a decaf version also so I could enjoy the great flavor of this one anytime!  I think this will be the main coffee in this house; I've tried some of the others and liked some of them more than others, but this is the runaway favorite.  I tend to put a good bit of cream and sugar in my coffee (can't stand it black!) but the nice flavor of this one comes through the cream and sugar.  (I've found that cream and sugar can't cover up the taste of coffee I don't like!)  I don't care for the bolder coffees at all (I don't feel like getting slapped in the face by my coffee in the morning!)<br /><br />I'd encourage everyone to give this a try if you like a light roast coffee with a mild, pleasant taste in the morning -- you won't be disappointed!!!

The 4 packages arrived NOT in an outer box! The packages are held together with yellow strapping tape. ALL 4 packages are ripped open in one way or another. One package has the bottom ripped off almost entirely and several coffee pods are missing. This disaster of shipping  was sitting out on my front porch in 95+ heat on a very humid Texas day. Mice, giant tree cockroaches, or kitties could have been prowling around inside the boxes. I can't believe UPS even accepted such a crappy packaging attempt. PLUS...I tried to find this Mike's Grocer online. The address on the return slip is 7 Prospect ST APT #4....an APARTMENT???? How do I even know where in the heck these pods originated? I LOVE Amazon and buy almost everything from them. This is my first REALLY horrible experience. Amazon....please get rid of this retailer!!!!!! Brenda Spurlin

review/summary: Breakfast Blend
review/text: This Breakfast Blend from Green Moutain coffee company is my favorite flavor of coffee when I just want a regular cup of coffee without that extra kick from a bold blend or a flavored coffee.  It has always been consistent and calming in its flavor.  It is top-notch coffee.

review/summary: Not the best, but CERTAINLY, not the worst!
review/text: This is a breakfast blend coffee and, for many coffee producers, a breakfast blend also means "the strongest daggone brew we can make" mentality.  Well, caffeine is caffeine and this guy is a bit strong for me.  I prefer Caribou's breakfast blend over this Green Mountain version. It's just entirely more smooth, no bitterness at all, and just a very enjoyable cup of coffee.  I think this one tastes a bit burnt, like Starbuck's, not at all as nice as some of their other blends (especially the pumpkin spice - awesome!).  Try it to see if it suits your taste but get the 12-pack first.  Otherwise, if you think the way I do, 24 of these guys is a LOT of coffee to wash down!

review/summary: Something like a cracker, but more like a snack.
review/text: The ever-growing line of snack foods from Nabisco now includes a Wheat Thin with a zesty tomato kick.  Each little canary-yellow box of Sundried Tomato & Basil crackers is filled with 9.5 ounces of the tastiest Wheat Thins yet.  These inch and a quarter squares have been generously sprinkled with a zippy, zingy Italian-style flavoring that will remind your taste buds of a freshly baked pizza, or a delicious spaghetti dinner.  They're very light, very thin, and very crisp and crunchy.  If you've got the willpower to limit yourself to a single serving of fifteen crackers, you'll be consuming 140 calories; 240 milligrams of sodium; 6 grams of fat; zero grams of trans fat (whatever that is); zero cholesterol; and 5 grams of...drum roll please... "WHOLE GRAIN" (whole grain is all the rage these days, as you've probably noticed).  If you're growing weary of those boring old saltines, you oughtta try these new Wheat Thins.  And don't forget, they're BAKED...not fried.

review/summary: A Snack not worth the swelling
review/text: I had a handful of these crackers last night - and though they are tasty, my hands, face, and ankles swelled to a ridiculous size.  I wasn't sure if it was the crackers or something else I ate - so I ate them by themselves at lunch - and again, I am a swollen mess.<br /><br />I didn't realize the MSG content was so high.  I won't be eating these again.  If you react to salt, sodium, or MSG - just stay away from these tasty little buggers.

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: I normally drink loose leaf tea.  However, the Revolution tea bags are amazing!<br /><br />1. They don't fill the bag with dust and fannings. There really are recognizably sized leaves in this bag.<br /><br />2. You can tell that the leaves are decent sized because the almost-clear nylon bag gives you a great view into them.<br /><br />3. They leave plenty of room for the leaves to expand in the bag. It's about 1/3 full, and when you steep the leaves, you can see that they expand and flatten out nicely.<br /><br />Of the two types of Revolution tea I've tried, White Tangerine Tea and Sweet Ginger Peach Tea, the Sweet Ginger Peach is my favorite.  However, I tend to like fruity herbal teas more than straight black / white / green teas.  I like to hand people a bag of the Sweet Ginger Peach and have them take a good whiff. Granted, a lot of teas are simply aromatic, but this tea isn't. It really does have the fruity taste of ginger and peach. I love it.<br /><br />Also, the Sweet Ginger Peach tea makes excellent iced tea.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: love, love, love this tea
review/text: I originally found the peach ginger tea at the grocery store, of all places, it said it was a close out and was going for $2.50/box!!!! I was so excited to see the nylon see thru bags, how elegant and special, and the tea was as great as the presentation! A wonderful taste of peach, no funky aftertaste, and even when you smell the whole leaves in the bag, it smells like peach.<br />Try it, you'll be amazed by this tea like I am.

review/summary: The beginning of a love affair
review/text: This was the first revolution tea flavor I ever tried, and it made me fall in love with the brand.  Having tried about half of revolution tea's line, I'd rate my favorites in order > Acai Green > Tropical green > Chocolate Orange Green > White Pear > Sweet Ginger Peach.  I'm more of a green and white tea fan, though, so your experience may differ.

review/text: This is the only tea in my house. I love its peachy taste and the ginger is very subtle. I have a cup every evening to put a soothing touch on my day. I got the pack of of 6 so I would never run out! Haven't tried the other ones those are next but wanted to make sure I had enough of this one.

review/text: My friends and I have enjoyed this kind of tea at a resturant called P.F.Changs and I found it at a local store but much better prices at Amazon. I am enjoying it for icetea as well as hot tea. Very good tea. I split the order with a friend who also liked it and wanted some.

review/summary: Very Peachy
review/text: It's Okay but I must warn that the title is misleading. It should just be called Peach Tea, as I don't taste ginger at all. That was why I purchased it in the first place, for the ginger infusion. Joke is on me!

review/text: We tried the tea hot and really liked the taste.<br />So we tried it as iced tea and it comes out great in the iced tea maker using 3 bags per pitcher.<br />My previous favorite was Stash peach black tea and I usually don't like the peach teas that are not from black tea.<br />Stash is still a close 2nd.

review/summary: Ginger Peach Tea A Hit
review/text: Ginger Peach Tea has the most amazing peach smell.  Who does not love peach?  It feels so luxurious to smell and sip a sun-ripened peach.  Even though I'm down South, I enjoy it warm or hot all year long.  (Thank the Lord for air conditioning!)  The warmth enhances the odor and thus the flavor.  It's also good cold.  It has become my favorite tea.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FQJT3Q">Kindle 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 3G Works Globally, Graphite, 6" Display with New E Ink Pearl Technology</a>)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040GJJ02">DecalGirl Kindle Skin (Fits 6" Display, Latest Generation Kindle) Tahiti (Matte Finish)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA0PIQ">The Twilight Saga Collection</a>

review/summary: Not always sweet
review/text: I love the sweet ginger peach tea. I drink a cup every morning before I go to work and every night before I go to bed. I love it so much that when all of the local grocery stores stopped carrying it, I drove to another city to buy it. And when that store stopped carrying it, I bought it here on Amazon, or so I thought.<br /><br />Turns out that only half of the boxes actually contained Sweet Ginger Peach Tea. Inside of each box is a sealed bag.<br />Last night I opened a box of tea, and opened the bag, made a cup of tea, and promptly spit it out.<br />It wasn't Sweet Ginger Peach tea at all. I couldn't figure it out. I pulled the bag out of the box to find out my box had been filled with a bag of Earl Grey Lavendar tea. Gross.<br /><br />I promptly opened another box to find the same thing. Out of the case of tea, half of it was Earl Grey Lavendar.<br /><br />If this case had been the Sweet Ginger Peach Tea, I would rate it five stars and tell everyone how lovely and soothing it is. But since the order was filled with boxes whose contents had been switched with something completely different, all I can do is say, save your money and your time and order elsewhere.<br /><br />EDIT!! After reading my complaint, Amazon refunded the full cost of the tea to my charge card. Their e-mail stated that they are going to investigate the issue with the packaging. I did not expect such a quick response. Hopefully they will get the issues straightened out and I can once again order this lovely tea!! Love AMAZON

review/summary: A splendid flavored tea
review/text: This is a distinctive, different and very enjoyable tea. Fragrant and highly flavorful: it's almost liqueurlike, without any alcoholic side effects of course. Good on its own or with the usual suspect additives (milk, sugar and/or lemon). Try it at work: you'll convert your fellow galley slaves.

review/summary: Nylon bags are not my idea of high quality tea
review/text: Its my understanding (based on discussions with material scientists!) that nylon releases toxins when put into hot water..so..whats the deal with the nylon tea bags?  This wasn't stated anywhere or I wouldn't have bought them.  The company told me they wee FDA approved, but the FDA is only worried about things that will kill you in the short run, or that have very high levels of dangerous chemicals.  Trace amounts are permitted.  Considering how much tea I drink, I'd rather not add toxins to my body every single time.<br /><br />In contrast Might Leaf, while they have similar looking tea bags, theirs are not nylon and are biodegradable in addition to not being dangerous.<br /><br />Very disappointed in this product.  They should at least have been upfront about the nylon bags so concerned people can avoid buying them.

review/summary: Best oatmeal ever
review/text: This is IMHO the best instant oatmeal ever. The problem is only one grocery in my area carries this brand and they are erratic in stocking the flavors I like (Apples 'n Cinnamon and Baked Apple). Consequently, I have to order it on line. The only draw back to online ordering is price; it cost me more than 100% more to order on line than to purchase in the store ($0.99 in store vs $2.15 per serving on line). And to make matters worse, Amazon doesn't stock it all the time. Right now I have to sign up to be notified when it will be available again. So, I end up having to go to other suppliers on line to find this product.<br /><br />However, this is still the best instant oatmeal in the world and I will pursue it to the ends of the earth!!!!

review/summary: This is not Herbal and does not taste like Peach
review/text: Somehow I missed the word spice. I wanted Peach tea, but this is black tea with clove and orange peel flavoring.  I wanted to get off of black tea as it  can cause low hemoglobin which is not good for folks who want to donate blood regularly.  Unfortunately, although this is advertised as peach, it is just black tea.
