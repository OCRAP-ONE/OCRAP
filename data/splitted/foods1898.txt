review/text: I bought these sweet potatoes for my 4th child and honestly they make jarred sweet potatoes taste like a gourmet meal. They don't even taste like sweet potatoes, I'm not sure how to describe it. I'm not really happy to see cornstarch in the ingredient list either. I was hoping to use these to thicken my homemade purees and sneak them in my toddlers food but after using them like regular baby food I can't feed them to my kids. :(

review/text: I'm not one to write reviews, but the sweet potato was so disgusting that it is worth mentioning.  It was not bright orange, but rather dark and it smelled and tasted like burnt sweet potatoes.  My 7 month old, who is not by any means a picky eater, was repulsed by these.

review/summary: Fresh and delicious!
review/text: I bought all the flavors of NurturMe offered on Amazon and we decided to try the peas first.  When I mixed the formula in, I could not believe how bright green the peas were.  I tasted them and they tasted like the freshest peas I ever ate.  I had only planned to throw these in the diaper bag for a quick feeding on the go with easy portability, but so far these are the only peas my daughter will eat!  Next we tried the apples and they were better than the best applesauce I've ever had.  I make my own baby food, and because many fruits and veggies arent the best right now, these powdered baby foods are better than what I can make homemade!  Every flavor has been as good as the last.  All are bright, colorful, and taste very, very fresh.

review/summary: Watch out for the ingredients!!
review/text: Crunchy carrots contain - organic carrot, organic maltodextrin and lecithin.<br />Hearty Sweet Potatoes contain - organic sweet potatoes, organic maltodextrin, organic corn starch, sunflower lecithin.<br />Plump peas and crunchy apples contain - 100% peas and 100% apples.<br /><br />The peas and the apples were the first products I tried from this company.  The baby loved them and I loved the ingredients.  I thought I would try the other products so I ordered the carrots and sweet potatoes.  To my surprise and disappoinment, when they arrived, I saw that they contained ingredients that I was not pleased with.  I wrote Nurturme and asked why they put maltodextrin in their products unnecessarily and they responded, The organic maltodexrin in our products is derived form organic corn.  Maltodextrins are manufactured form starch and are extensively used as an emulsifier in foods.<br />They are included in our foods because they are binding agents that are used when our foods are dried.  Like starch, most maltodextrins are easily digested and used for energy in the body." So, while the carrots and sweet potatoes are probably fine, they did not contain ingredients that I wanted to feed my baby.  The biggest issue being that this information was not included in the product description on amazon.

review/summary: Best baby food (we've) tried
review/text: I've been one to study labels on food packaging that I plan to consume, even more so now that I'm a father of two young ones.  Prerequisite: No hydrogenated oils, high fructose, or preservatives.  There are a few other ingredients but these are the main offenders.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised when I recently read an article on NurturMe baby food.  The article linked to their site (nurturme.com), so I spent some time perusing to learn more about the brand.  For one, I thought the packaging was super appealing and a wonderful idea.  Simple packets vs. glass jars, right up my alley.  Secondly, I wasn't too keen on "quick dried" foods, but did some research on it and quickly found that through this method, the food maintains it's nutrients with no preservatives needed...passed my test.  After ordering a few packets of each flavor (pea, squash, sweet potato and apple) on NurturMe's site, I received them a few days later and had both my babes try them out (5 mo and 26 mo's old).  I used my wife's breast milk to reconstitute the sweet potato for the youngster and water for my elder babe and figured apple was a good start since he's a big fan.  After pouring the contents of one packet into a small bowl it didn't appear there was much, however, after mixing it with the water and breast milk it turned into quite a good serving size.  The first thing that really jumped out was how rich and vibrant the flavor of the food was - a great indicator that there's no preservatives.  The smell was also right on target, as if I'd just sliced a sweet potato or apple.  I gave it a try myself and said, "hmm, good stuff."  I then gave the apple to my son and just let him get after it.  After turning around from providing my daughter with the sweet potato, my son had literally gobbled almost every last bit of apple.  The sweet potato would have been taken care of in the same way had my daughter's dexterity been at the level of my son.  GREAT product.

review/text: My 7 month old usually enjoys sweet potato, but would not take more than a couple of bites of this version.  When I tasted it myself, I understood why.  I also did not like the fact that this NurturMe has maltodextrin and corn starch.  My son enjoys the apple NurturMe (which contains only apples).  These are very convenient and a great idea.

review/summary: Not a fan - taste leaves something to be desired
review/text: Perhaps it's the additional ingredients (organic maltodextrin, organic corn starch, organic sunflower lecithin), but this stuff tastes really awful.  I have an 8 month old, and added less water to make it thicker.  All that really accomplished was to make the powder less dilute & the pungent flavor even stronger.  My child wouldn't eat this until I mixed it in with some other food.  I'll use what I have left to add to other food for the nutritional value that the powders offer, but I was really surprised & disappointed in this product.  How do you mess up something so simple as sweet potatoes?  Great idea, poor execution & way too expensive for this product.

review/text: Have been sampling a bunch of these reheatable rice products lately. This is by far the worst. Tastes like a toxic chemical spill. Goopy texture, wasteful packaging. Safeway organic brand is pretty decent, as are some imports from Japan (and for about the same price as the expensive Minute Rice). Also, weight of product is listed at 2.5 pounds. They must pack it with lead weights. This is a small package. Not recommended.

review/text: Minute� Ready to Serve Rice is a great idea, however the price is too high for the product.  You don't get full side dish size servings per cup.  You really need 3 cups for a normal side dish size serving.  So the rice would cost you about $ 3.00.  Too high.  I would recommend it for a quick snack or to keep around for emergencies.  The taste is good and the texture is nice and firm.

While I can't say this is the healthiest of breakfasts, it's a nice treat for dessert or to mix in with plain Cheerios.  There is whole grain corn and oats in the cereal, however there is a whopping 9 grams of sugar, so I wouldn't want to feed this to my kids every morning.<br /><br />If you like cereals like Cocoa Puffs or Cocoa Pebbles, the flavor is close to it.

It's true -- it is only available in our area of North Carolina around Halloween, and the only store that seemed to carry it was an hour's drive away.  So, for a little surprise, I found it online through Amazon, and got her 3 boxes.  Our daughters also enjoy it, and I got a few brownie points in the process.  Have fun, stay young.

review/text: I was SO excited to receive the cereal I loved as a child.  I didn't get it all the time back then, but often enough that now, 25 years later, I could close my eyes and ALMOST taste it.  When I saw it for sale, I'd nearly forgotten it existed and was thrilled to order.  As soon as I opened the box, I realized this was not going to be the same experience.  The cereal has completely changed, in both appearance and taste.  It's very similar to Cap 'n Crunch Crunchberries now -- only not half as flavorful.  I wouldn't at all encourage lovers of the original to give this a try.  You will be sorely disappointed.  :(

And percentages are listed by each ingredient. 5% of the ingredients is coffee powder. WOW! It is a very dark brown, almost black, rectangular, hard candy. It isn't overly sweet. Coffee is the first flavor that you taste, a nice strong coffee flavor that is consistent throughout the whole candy. Definitely one of the better coffee candies. 8 out of 10<br />  FYI- United, Kopiko and Coffee Rio were the top finishing coffee candies in my taste test.<br />  God bless. Mike

review/text: These were sitting in a small bowl on the counter at a local sushi place.  I tried one while I waited for my order and was so taken aback by how much I liked them that I ordered them from Amazon on the spot.  My regular order at Dunkin Donuts, or any other coffee shop is little cream, little sugar.  I would say these candies fall somewhere in that general taste range.  If you like your coffee sweet and light, these might not be for you.  If you like your coffee black, you might be comfortable with these.  I wouldn't call them overly bitter, but they are still a far cry from sweet.  They taste very much like coffee and think it's a safe bet that you will find nothing closer than these.  Great thing to have around if you just genuinely love the taste of coffee!

review/text: These are a hard candy--hard like a Lifesaver, not like a hard toffee such as the Rio coffee candy, which will soften somewhat in your mouth. The flavor is about as about as strong as the Rio and tastes very similar to the Rio when you have a good batch of Rio. It is noticeably less piquant and not as strong as the Bali coffee candy. The pieces about the same size as the Bali and they are not nearly as large as the Coffee Nips brand, which are annoyingly big on size and disappointingly small on flavor.<br /><br />They are not difficult to unwrap, being packaged in the same kind of individual pouches as the Bali.<br /><br />If you like the United, I think you will probably appreciate the Bali more. IF you like the United but prefer a toffee, you might like the Rio better, provided it's a good batch.<br /><br />_______________Coffee Flavor_____________Texture<br />Bali...........piquant/rich/strong.............hard sugar<br />Rio............moderate-varies by batch......hard toffee<br />United.........moderate.......................hard sugar<br />Kopiko.........piquant/rich strong............hard sugar<br />Coffee Nips....weak/bland.....................hard toffee

review/summary: This is good stuff
review/text: I really like the way this candy tastes. It's not too sweet, and doesn't taste too much like coffee. The balance is perfect. But the mane  reason I got these was for the caffeine. It takes at least 5 to equal the caffeine in a Dr. Pepper, which isn't bad, but I was hoping it would be more like 1 or 2.

review/summary: Tasty But Not Overpowering Coffee Candy, Fit for a Picnic
review/text: I unwrapped a piece of United Coffee Candy while Nancy and I sat for an afternoon in a park. Dulcet, yet strong flavors filled my imagination as we cleared the branches for our blanket. The candy's metallic maroon wrapper soon lay tossed in a pocket, or a bag, who knows where?<br /><br />A mid-city stream during a quiet picnic can be as cacophonous as a mid-state river. Rapids, wind, gulls all called out to each other as autumn began its march through the wane of summer. Undeterred, Nancy and I read the poetry of the day: our own, and that found in an old professor's reading list. Many hums and other murmurs of agreement brought us through a dozen pages and an hour of reading.<br /><br />We asked, "Is that a complex form or does it just organically resonate mellifluously?"<br /><br />Not all questions can be answered while distracted by the pleasant confluence of her eyes, the falling leaves and the coffee candy. All blended into a gentle sweetness: to see, to smell, to taste.<br /><br />Now, three months later, I find the wrapper in my satchel, and the stream rushes just as hard. The gulls are gone, but the poetry remains. May your bag of United Coffee Candy reach as deeply, taste as complex, and remind you of poems read on a bank.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/summary: Strange
review/text: I had a lemon bar for the first time last year and I was hooked. Had always seen them but never tried them thinking it would be too much lemon for my taste. I was SO wrong and kick myself for the years I deprived myself of that sweet lemony goodness. Mmmm. I also tried key lime pie for the first time last year (crazy right? I'm so deprived lol ). Again I was hooked. So when I saw these key lime bars I thought I would be so in love with them. Always saw lemon bars never key lime bars. Awesomeness! I thought. Boy was I wrong. Made a box and they seemed "off". Just didn't taste right. Figured I did something wrong. So I made another box. Can't put my finger on it but something just isn't right. Not only that but as someone said while they were cooling in the fridge...'What is THAT? Looks like some weird science experiment" And honestly it does. lol So sad they did not end up being as good as I had hoped. Now I have 10 boxes left.I guess I can try to doctor them up, maybe into a cheesecake? *shrugs* We'll see how that goes. Anyway I really wouldn't recommend this one. Maybe I got a batch batch?

review/summary: Yum Yum and I can understand the ingredients!!!
review/text: I just ordered this after seeing it in my specialty pet food store.  It's a tad expensive but I can understand why.  I can totally read and understand all the ingredients!  And my picky dogs both LOVE it.  I also like that they tell you the calories per treat (8.8 if you're wondering) so I can better keep track of my dogs daily caloric intake.<br /><br />The fact that it comes in small pouches also is great so you don't open an big pouch and let it go stale.<br /><br />Both my dogs (including my 5lb Maltese) LOVE it!!<br /><br />My only criticism of this product would be how much the label recommends for small dogs.  I would never give my dog 16 treats per day!!!  That's almost half of one of my dog's entire day's needs and almost 2/3 of my smaller Maltese's needs!!!<br /><br />Oh, and a 2nd criticism: although it's called the "pumpkin and blueberries" treat, if you look at the ingredient list, blueberries are second to last on the list...which means very little blueberries.  Slightly misleading in my opinion.  It would be more correct to say "pumpkin and oatmeal" or "pumpkin and molasses" or anything else besides blueberries.<br /><br />But overall, I will be using these instead of baking my own.

review/text: I love giving my dog healthy treats including natural fruit. Of the dog treats that she enjoys these actually smell good, and are a great way of moderating calorie intake for those dogs who may be prone to weight gain. The only con to this treat is that the cookies are hard enough that they are not easy to break up into pieces if you have a smaller dog, or want to further ration the treat (as a training treat). The variety in fruit flavors is also a plus, allowing you to make treat/training time less boring for your four legged friend.

review/summary: The real deal
review/text: When Americans drink hot tea, they usually drink orange pekoe tea, so most Americans can't understand why the English drink tea.  English tea is black tea, and not the low quality of black tea generally available in the United States.  I have tried many English teas and to me Yorkshire Red is the absolute best.  I choose the tea bags with tabs because of convenience, but the same great flavour is available in the traditional tagless bags.  Try this tea and teatime might become a tradition in your home too.

review/summary: Satisfy your hunger and your desire to drop a few pounds
review/text: Through the work week, breakfast is perfunctory with oatmeal just another option among cereal bars and yogurt. We've stocked various brands of instant oatmeal but Quaker Oatmeal Express best balances our desires for tasty and healthy. Our sons - ages 6 and 4 - enjoy the different flavors. My wife likes the individual cups, which make clean-up a breeze.<br /><br />Quaker Oatmeal Express is office-friendly, too. You can prepare the oatmeal with hot water or a microwave. Either way, you've got a no-mess breakfast in less than two minutes. Again, the individual cups are great for a portable option much healthier than anything you'll find on a fast food drive-thru menu.<br /><br />We've purchased three Quaker Oatmeal Express flavors, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPO6LU">Cinnamon Roll</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HIFB8Q">Golden Brown Sugar</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HIHEL8">Baked Apple</a>. All three are not overly sweet. My youngest son doesn't care for cinnamon, so he eats Baked Apple or Golden Brown Sugar. The Baked Apple flavor has a slight fiber edge (1 g) over the other flavors.<br /><br />In summary, skip the sausage egg biscuit and pick up this healthier breakfast option instead. (Studies have found that oatmeal is more filling than dry cereal with the same calories and fiber content.) Quaker Oatmeal Express is healthy, portable and makes clean-up easy.<br /><br />One caveat: if time is not a consideration, the best oatmeal you can buy on Amazon is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5U3I">McCANN'S Steel Cut Oatmeal</a>. We purchase it through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program. This is our Sunday-morning-family-breakfast oatmeal. We add frozen berries, or a tablespoon of brown sugar and an ounce of Drambuie to the cooking pot. The texture and nutty flavor of McCann's oatmeal sets it apart from anything else we've experienced.

review/text: I am so addicted to this oatmeal.  :)  The taste is awesome, not dull, not too sweet, and it has a lot of great oatmeal texture and isn't mushy like other oatmeals.  I like my oatmeal thick so I don't put as much water in it as recommended, and it comes out fabulous.  I have it as a snack, perhaps not the healthiest choice of snack food (because of the added sugar and salt) but better than a pack of cookies or a candy bar.<br /><br />(I'm cracking up because I was going to make "yummy" a tag for this product, but someone already did!)

review/text: Quaker Instant oatmeal is hard to find in many stores out west. Typically, the single packaged cups are available and who wants to purchase one at a time? By buying them in bulk quantities, you can save a few shopping trips and the gasoline by having them shipped direct to your home. I bought a 24 pack for about a $1.00 a cup! A great deal.<br /> A tasty oatmeal that's quick to make and tastes great. For those in a hurry to work or take with you on camping trips or whatever Quaker instant oatmeal is an excellent product.

I have purchased Gentlease in different size cans and cases and am still using it with my twins.<br /><br />Next... The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age. But here in the U.S. after your 3 months maternity leave, are you able to pump enough and store in a refrigerator at work? And you might need formula anyway as we do. I mention this because some imply their formula is as good as human breast milk.<br /><br />We're blessed with twins. They started out colicky and we found that Nutramigen worked at that time. They got through that phase and we've been using Gentlease and solids. After they're a year old it will be all solids. Our pediatrician recommended Gentlease. It has 1/5 the lactose of milk-based formula.<br /><br />I really researched formulas. There are even organizations promoting the sale of human breast milk and there are organizations wanting to stop the sale of human breast milk for fear of health hazards that the FDA cannot control. No matter, those offering breast milk do so at prohibitively high prices - nothing charitable about it.<br /><br />All the brands that I've seen have DHA and ARA, nutrients found in breast milk that promote brain and eye development, iron which is necessary for growth and many more ingredients. The government requires them to have certain ingredients. The major brands do not seem highly differentiated to me except for their specialy models. Gentlease is one of those.<br /><br />Gentlease is one of the special formulas because it has a much lower amount of lactose as well as broken down proteins to make it easier to digest.<br /><br />The prices vary and so do the size of the cans and the number of cans in a case. Unfortunately, I haven't seen Gentlease in big cans at the big box stores. One can also check at the local pharmacy or grocery store for comparison purposes. Keep an eye out for coupons too. You've got to keep constant watch for the best price, and there have been times when the Amazon price prevails.

review/summary: Greatly reduces gas
review/text: My baby was born with excess gas in her digestive system (discovered in the NICU and further x-rays).  At her first pediatric appointment I mentioned this to the doctor and he recommened this formula.  We have used it ever since then and she's 6 months old now.  She doesn't gas or burp that much, especially when compared to my first child who was given the regular Enfamil Lipil formula with the yellow label.<br />This formula in combination with a vented bottle such as Playtex Ventaire Advanced worked wonders to relieve and/or prevent gas discomfort.

I ordered this and spritzed some very good, but older toys, along with a larger, soft floppy toy I purchased for one of my dogs, that she had no interest in. They both went beserk.  They played and exercised and enjoyed themselves.  I found Punkin sound asleep with her head on top of the soft rabbit dog toy.

review/summary: A pretty good, not outstanding collection of flavored tea.
review/text: I luv tea, both Chinese and Western tea, as well as tea that blends both.<br /><br />China, Japan, and Ceylon all have a long tradition of producing the best Green tea, and I must hasten to add that Green tea is really not a good oriental tea that can blend well with western tea such as Earl Grey, or with any fruit flavors.<br /><br />Fortnum & Mason, a British tea company, has created some of the best flavored teas that blend Chinese black tea with fruit flavors like Peach, Strawberry, Mango, Apple, Cranberry, Lemon. I also tried their Green Tea that blends with fruit flavors and other tea. Except the Moroccan Mint Tea, I don't think they taste as good in general as the black tea blends!<br /><br />Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised when a student of mine gave me this gift pack of Bentley's tea, and found out that the Mango Green Tea was actually the best mango flavored tea that I ever tried. I also thought the other flavors were also quite good: Blueberry Green Tea, Red Rapsberry Green Tea, Minty Mint Green Tea, Earl Grey Green Tea, Vanilla Green Tea, and Pomegranate tea.  The flavors that I didn't care for were: Orange Spice Tea, Jasmine Green Tea, and Oriental Treasure Green Tea.

Love that you can actually identify everything that's in the can. The pop tops are another huge bonus, especially for people like us who travel frequently (don't even need a utensil to get the food into a bowl; it just pours out). Another bonus is because of the consistency (kind of a thick fish soup), our dogs don't feel the need to take it out of their bowls to eat. It's more expensive than I'd like, but can also understand that the ingredients aren't cheap.

review/text: Regan's Orange Bitters #6 is just as advertised. Intense and very potent, it will give your Manhattan or Old Fashioned a real kick in the pants. I want to experiment using it with Crepes Suzette or Grand Marnier cakes - it should intensify and enhance quite well. In addition: If you have not tried Fee Brother's Old Fashion Aromatic Bitters or Peychaud's Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - then you have not experienced what bitters can do for your cocktails - or vanilla ice cream - for that matter! I am afraid that the old stand-by Angostura just doesn't compare - and I like Angostura very much!

This is not to say that it is better; different cocktails work better with the other two. I find that a dash of these ones turns an otherwise decent sidecar into an incredible one.

review/summary: Your Secret Ingredient
review/text: Bitters are making a resurgence these days and I know many bars (at least here in NYC) are bringing back a properly made cocktail.  Looking at old cocktail books from the 20s, 30s, and 40s I found that bitters were a key ingredient in many classic cocktails.  After doing extensive research I learned that Regan's made some of the best, if not the best, orange bitters (go to their website and read the story behind this product).  Your other choices are Fee Brothers and Angostura.  Regan's however gets, and in my opinion, deserves top billing when it comes to orange bitters.  These bitters are great in a variety of drinks and I usually put two dashes in my Old Raj martinis.  Although you don't get a strong orange flavor per se you do notice that these bitters subtly enhance the complexity of the drink.  Try these and you won't be disappointed.  Go to Regan's website to find literally hundreds of drink recipes that use their bitters.  You'll be inspired to make something more than a boring vodka tonic or gin martini.

review/summary: WHO REALLY NEEDS IT?
review/text: Orange bitters are an essential ingredient in the Sazerac cocktail -- "Official Cocktail of the City of New Orleans" -- which carries a history as complex as does the Crescent City.<br /><br />The most famous orange bitters were compounded by Antoine Am&eacute;d&eacute;e Peychaud, a Haitian apothecary who moved to New Orleans in the early 1800s.  He dispensed a proprietary mix of aromatic bitters from an old family recipe to relieve the ails of his clients, and became famous for a toddy he made for his friends:  French brandy, bitters, a splash of water and a bit of sugar.<br /><br />The drink was soon served in bars throughout the city.  Sewell Taylor, proprietor of one such "coffeehouse," began importing and serving Sazerac-du-Forge et fils brandy, leading to the renaming of the "Sazerac Coffee House" with its 12 bartenders mixing "Sazeracs" for their patrons.<br /><br />Around 1870, the primary ingredient of the Sazerac was changed from cognac to rye whiskey due to popular American tastes and the difficulty of obtaining cognac.  Somewhere along the line a dash of absinthe was added to coat the glass, later changed to "Herbsaint" -- et voil&agrave;! -- the modern Sazerac cocktail.<br /><br />Orange bitters may also be used in other drinks where bitters are called for, as a matter of taste.  I took a liking to an alternative Sazerac recipe including both Angostura bitters and orange bitters.  Because I could not be assured that Peychaud's bitters would be sufficiently 'orange' or just a close cousin to Angostura, I tried Regan's Orange Bitters.  They are distinctive and offer another flavor to the alcoholic spice cabinet, but I cannot say whether they are better than Peychaud's -- the original New Orleans concoction.<br /><br />Unless you are really a cocktail purist and have access to an extensively stocked bar, keeping all the "authentic" Sazerac ingredients -- Rye, Herbsaint, and one or two varieties of bitters -- is probably unreasonable.  And when making exotic cocktails, of course we must value Reason above all else.
