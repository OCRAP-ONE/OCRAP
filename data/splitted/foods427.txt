review/summary: 2 star for chicken/4 star since organic = 3
review/text: I usually buy Wolfgang Puck's version of chicken noodle organic soup, but since I did not love it I decided to try this brand. Well if you picture Puck's being the soup represented as the Progresso chicken noodle soup in the Progresso commercial and Health Valley being Campbell's soup, well that's the difference you get in this soup. There was approximately one teaspoon of of very small diced chicken in a can. The noodles were very soft intermingled with a few pieces of vegetables. The opaque broth was the best part as it was not salty and had a delicate flavor. I've decided to resume purchasing Wolfgang's until I stumble upon one I like better. I applaud any company that makes organic food products, so I may try another Health valley product in the future.

review/summary: Heavenly Delicious!
review/text: Just got my box today. 3 days after my purchace and i am happily pleased with the shipping. In the package it has a handsize icepack so while it's being delievered the candy won't melt. I was worried about the melting since it's summer and especially here in Texas, i'm surprised and sooooo soo pleased the candy didn't get all mushed and ruined. This kind of reese's are my favorite and very hard to come by offline in regular shops that sell candy. Just the commercialized candy, that i for one get tired of easily. Very delicious, soft, milky taste. Very addicting too. So 5 stars on everything!! :)

review/text: If you are looking for delicious, peanut buttery goodness, try these delightful White Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups. Yes, they are so good I had to capitalize the product, just to draw as much attention to them, as possible. White chocolate technically is not chocolate, but, you wouldn't know it here. These cups are creamy, sweet and don't feel 'heavy.' If that makes any sense. You just get a great peanut butter cup fix.

As I was munching my absolutely delicious cookie I had a look-see at the Nutrition Facts printed on the wrapper - that's when I had my second "WOW!".<br />ONE cookie is TWO servings - when was the last time you cut a cookie in half?  So....if you are glutinous enough to eat your entire cookie at one time, you have consumed 340 calories (100 are fat calories)and 40 mg. of cholesterol.  I was astounded to say the least.  As someone with a gluten allergy, I can tell you that there are other really good cookies out there without these kinds of overloads.  Try the Glutino sandwich cookies, for example.

review/text: This chutney is so nice that when I noticed there were no reviews, I had to add one. We take this product all over the world with us, serve it at receptions and at the most formal of dinners. People think it is homemade. Chili-Lime is our family favorite, and is often specifically requested by return dinner guests - regardless of what we are serving. It is zesty, with well-balanced spicing and the taste is fresh. All the Geeta brands we have tried - we have tried many - are excellent quality. The condiment matches well with fish, beef, rice, chicken, curry or even on toast. Bon Appetite!

review/text: Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is the best coconut oil I've found. With a light mild flavor, it's perfect for cooking and baking. It's also more transparent as a liquid, with little residue. Not much gunk, even at the bottom of the container. My only complaint is that in the liquid form, its not easy to pour without dripping over the jar lip. Still, the nicest flavor of any coconut oil I've tried.

review/summary: Better than Expected!!!
review/text: This exact brand is in my very expensive neighborhood health store--12 oz. cost 19.99. So, I'm getting a great deal here and the taste is better than butter.  I've used it in everything from oatmeal to sauteeing veggies.  I will say that in the jar there is a very, very subtle coconut smell, but when combined with food there is none at all.  In fact, my other oil is ghee--and as good as that is, I prefer the coconut oil.  My husband who is funny about most things loves it too--he was especially crazy about the idea that he could have an oil that wouldn't raise his cholesterol and that actually aids your body rather than destroy it like most oils.  I purchased this particular brand less than a month ago, and we love it so much that I've ordered another shipment with double the order.

review/summary: This stuff literally SAVED my hair
review/text: Several years ago, I had a really short haircut.  At the time, I used a lot of heat on my hair (straightening).  My hair is grown out now, but the heat damage combined with the fact that I just moved to an area with really hard water left it really rough with a lot of dryness and split ends.  At certain areas towards the bottom it felt like straw.  I heard that you could use coconut oil as a leave-in conditioner, so I bought some of this.  After only a couple of weeks of use the difference is amazing!  I am so thrilled.  Obviously, it didn't fix my split ends (I have trimmed those) but the dryness has improved drastically.  What I have been doing is applying it to my hair, more concentrated at the ends, and leaving it in for a few hours before washing it out and then conditioning with regular conditioner.  My hair is SO shiny but not oily.  (Be careful not to use too much though because then it will be a little oily.  I did that the first time.)<br /><br />I haven't used it for cooking yet, but it seems like a really nice product overall.  Nice on dry skin too.  Melts in your hands and the smell is pleasant.

review/text: I purchased this oil from Amazon for cooking and for use as an after-shower, after-bath body oil.  Delivery was quick through Amazon, and I was very pleased with the purchase.  The oil has a pleasant but light coconut fragrance and is very light-weight.  I haven't used it for cooking yet, however, I have used it after shower, and it is a great moisturizer that is absorbed into the skin well, leaving minimal-to-no oily residue on the skin.  I like the fact that it smells NATURALLY good (i.e. having no perfumes nor other unhealthy additives that would be absorbed through the skin).<br /><br />Since I will be cooking with this and eating it, I love the fact that it's organic and has been shown to improve the symptoms of and decline associated with Alzheimer's Disease.  This oil is supposed to have a shelf life of two years.  Wow.  We eat far too many processed and adulterated foods; hardly do we need any bulking agents, sweeteners, preservatives or artificial colors and flavors.

I've also been giving it to our dog, hoping it would help her with her skin allergies, but I don't think it has done much in that department.  I will still continue to give it to her, though, as I've read the many other benefits that it can help her with.<br />I prefer to have it when it's in its' melted stage & I just mix it with some fruit and it taste great that way.  It is a bit on the pricey side, but I think compared to other vitamin supplements, etc. it is well worth the money.

This makes a great hair conditioner as well. I ordered the 29oz of Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil and when I got low I immediately ordered the 54 oz. .it's a "must have" for my skin.  Don't get me wrong I still use other lotions, but guess what. .the coconut oil gets mixed in with it. I also do chemical facial peels at home once a week and this is a great moisturizer after a peel.  I SO recommend this.

review/text: This is actually quite a nice blend of spices for your bead, squash and corn chili.  I must admit that mine is better, but having a few packages of this stuff around does save time and does, in the long run, save money.  This is the sort of dish that I have yet to find any individual that actually dislikes it.  I first bought two packages of the near the Tarharah, Mountains at a spring rally and have never been sorry.  If you are a vegetarian, this is a wonderful change of pace sort of meal and it is rather easy to prepare. I cannot recommend this stuff more, or I would.  Try it...you will not be sorry!

review/summary: Leave The Lefse Alone
review/text: My son purchased this product for me with his Amazon Prime, which allowed him super quick shipping.  It came today, nice and fresh.  It is horrible.  It is made with dried potatoes instead of fresh, vegetable shortening instead of butter and sorbic acid as a preservative.  I took a bite and spit it out right away.  If you've ever had the real deal, homemade, this is NOT it.  I told my son to contact Amazon and get his money back.<br /><br />No matter how bad a cook you are, you could not mess up a recipe of this, so I suggest you go out and purchase a cookbook with a recipe for lefse in it.  Oh god, this is awful!

review/text: This stuff is horrid! I would give it minus 5 stars if I could. It doesn't even taste like lefse so I'm surprised it has been around for so long. My mom warned me not to get it, but I was craving it so bad and didn't have any homemade in my freezer. What a mistake, I should have trusted my mom. Please don't buy this, you will just end up throwing it away. It is well worth the time to make your own.  Your taste buds will thank you.

review/summary: Quite possibly the worst lefse' ever made!
review/text: This lefse' isn't even worth one star, but that was the lowest Amazon would let me go.  There is no flavor to it what-so-ever.  You can't taste the potatoes or the butter, all you taste is flour and it's very dry.  It used to be better years ago when it slightly resembled the taste of potatoes, but as it is with many items, they must have found ways to save a buck at the expense of the quality & flavor.  Don't waste your money!  You're better off investing in the equipment to make your own, or finding a website that sells an authentic "home-made" variety.  I grew up in a Scandinavian household that made traditional lefse' for family gatherings, trust me when I say Mrs Olson's is absolutely horrible.

review/text: I pick it up in the grocery store every once in a while (living in Minneapolis, its part of the culture). While its not the same as my sister-in-laws, I think its unfair to compare it to home-made which of course will be much better. Lefse is not like tortillas or pita bread which can taste like cardboard, it has a nice potato and cream flavor to it and is great for sandwiches, peanut butter and jelly, or traditional with butter and cinamon sugar. I usually have it with cheese and fruit.

review/summary: Why haven't they thought of this before?
review/text: I found this product today while on a trip, and it's genius. These are pre-measured packs of formula, just like the "to-go" water adults use in their water. All you do is add to 4 (or 8) oz of water and feed.  No need to bring along a bigger container, or pre-mix bottles and hope they don't go bad before I feed the baby.  My only criticism is that the package could be easier to open, since it was hard to open it while holding a baby, but the convenience factor far outweighed that.  I will definitely purchase this product again.

review/summary: Tastes great
review/text: This cheddar cheese tastes great.  It's not truly a sharp tangy taste but it is cheddar. The drawback is the shipping cost of nearly $20 for 2lbs eventhough it arrives virtually over night.  The nutrional label is as follows : ( for  a 1 & 1/4 size cube ) Calories 120, total fat 10g, saturated fat 6 grams, 0 trans fats, cholesterol 30mg, sodium 210, total carbs less than 1 g, protein 7 grams.<br />This cheese cannot be frozen as the label states.  It can be stored in the fridge up to one month but we consumed this in a week for a special party.  ( I included the nutritional content due to the marketplace did NOT state the facts when I bought this;  hopefully this helps other consumers )

review/summary: Himalayan Dark Pink Salt will keep you in the pink.
review/text: If you're looking for great value and great taste then this product is for you. I was skeptical about artisan salts and sea salts being different than regular salt until I accidentally ordered a case of sea salt from Portugal from our Co-op. Artisan salts and sea salts add flavor and zing to sea food, grilled foods and vegetables. I've never looked back and only use these special kinds of salts on everything. Be advised, though, if you put pink salt on something, it will turn that something slightly pink.<br /><br />Try this salt and then try salt from Hawaii, Portugal, France, prussian blue from Germany, salt from Japan, Mexico, etc ... You will be surprised at the diversity in taste.

review/summary: Culinary secret
review/text: Someone recently gave me a small grinder containing pink Himalayan rock salt crystals.  The difference in the taste it added to food prompted me to do some reading on the differences.  You can do your own reading and I'll just say that it opens up a whole new world of flavors.  When that small grinder neared being empty I set about to find some refill material.  The price of the product from this supplier made me suspicious of it's quality.  Happily though........it's as good as any I've found.  The packaging and shipping were both professional and I am quite pleased with the order and intend to be a repeat customer.

review/text: I really love this salt.  Not a strong taste and it doesn't overwhelm foods.  Just adds a nice, clean flavor.  Also a beautiful color.  Always a conversation starter when I put it on the table.<br /><br />Be advised that the pieces are rather large and the salt itself is "dense" rather than "crumbly" so you will need to have a good quality mill.  Our Oxo mill handles it fine, but I did try a lever-operated mill--no luck.<br /><br />Finally, the 2.2 pound bag (a kilo) costs the same as the two pound bag.  Why would anyone not buy the kilo package?

review/summary: Need magnifying glass to find liver.
review/text: Finally, a canned cat food that the kitties are eating (at least for now, with a few vitamins & minerals. And this brand won't end up in the dog bowls! But I am hard pressed to find the chunks of liver - very skimpy - which is really O.K. because the cats leave what few itty bitty pieces that ARE in the can behind (3 Star for deceptive liver chunks/ 5 Star for chicken breast).  Looks almost as pictured, except for liver chunks.  I also bought the plain chicken from same company & will just go with that and rate a 5-STAR.  If your kitties LOVE cooked liver, you won't find enough in this recipe to satisfy their hunger - unless they eat all of the chicken too, which you probably wouldn't buy if cat didn't like chicken.  I am just so happy to transit the dry food & salty canned chicken addicted cat to a wet food to save on the kidneys. I do have one cat that loves raw liver & chicken, but I like to take a day off from adding vitamins and messing with raw meat (cutting, etc) so this is going to work out, it appears; hopefully for awhile - though one never knows with kitties.  Great today - terrible tomorrow!

review/summary: unbeatable quality
review/text: i was a skeptic of this product when i first met the rep in my pet store a few years back because they'll tell you anything to push a sale. "human grade this", "super-luxe that", and so on. out of curiosity, i picked up a few cans at a different pet store in the area to test it out.<br /><br />my. cat. LOVED. them.<br /><br />every morsel, licked clean from the bowl. this price offered online is an exceptionally good bargain: 36.92 for a 24-can case gives you a deal of just over $1.50 per 5.5 oz can. i've never seen it for less than $1.99 in stores with the average being around $2.50/can. the quality of this product is simply unbeatable, period. the moisture content is great for weight management, urinary tract and dental health. the meat quality is absolutely unbeatable compared to any canned food i've ever seen. the best part is the SMELL - delicious! it smells just like canned soup for people to eat. it doesn't smell anything like cheap, canned cat food... because it isn't.<br /><br />do yourself and your cat a favor. buy this product and lots of it.

review/summary: Excellent,cats love this food
review/text: just received my case of this food after reviewing many other types. I wanted something that was organic and healthy for my two cats,instead of taking them to the vet all the time..They absolutely LOVE this food,plenty of juice and meat. One 5.5 oz can feeds them both heartily and they lick the dish clean. I started them on an organic holistic dry food over a month ago and I see a big change in their coats,so shiny and soft. I believe that the added expense should keep them overall much healthier and happy...

review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: My cat likes Mideast Feast and Asian Fusion. He's not so crazy for the chicken or Marbella Paella, but I think it's more that he doesn't like non-fish and doesn't like shellfish.<br /><br />This stuff might be a bit expensive but I see it this way:<br /><br />With the wet food I used to buy, if I didn't take care and left some in my sink or garbage can for more than a few days, there will be small flies that emerged from it. With all the Weruva stuff, I've left some remnants out in my sink for a week and no flies. I really think the cheaper, more available wet cat food has something wrong with it to be spawning flies so quickly.

review/summary: Best wet food I've ever purchased!
review/text: I have 2 super-picky older cats (13 & 9).  I've tried so many options, but this is the first one where the CLEAN the bowl.  I've tried every flavor of Weruva on them, and the plain chicken is by far their favorite.  They like the other chicken varieties but for some reason there are peas, carrots, and pumpkin in it, all of which they strategically eat around.  They both can't stand fish, so chicken it is!<br /><br />Being meat and gravy in it's almost purest form, it definitely has a positive impact on their health.  Their fur is shinier and softer.  And they seem more happy and playful.<br /><br />I never used to believe a food upgrade could make such a difference, but this certainly did!!

review/summary: Very pleased
review/text: This food is a hit!<br /><br />The cat likes it because it's got chunks of shredded meat in gravy.  He won't eat ground or pate-style foods, so the shredded meat in this one is a winner.<br /><br />I like it because, for one thing, it's grain-free.  To my mind, if you could only pick one quality to shop for, grain-free would be it; carbohydrates - and particularly grains! - are not good for cats.  It's very high in protein, which *is* good for cats.  It contains pumpkin, and while that is a carbohydrate, it's supposed to be good for their tummies.  I'm also pleased that it contains duck meat, since I like to rotate my cat's protein sources to take advantage of their differing nutritional profiles.  And finally, it's got plenty of gravy to help my cat stay hydrated; cats are built to take in much of their fluid from their food sources, so feeding dry food exclusively can dehydrate them (and possibly lead to urinary crystals).<br /><br />True, it's expensive.  Even for higher-end cat foods, it's expensive.  But if you'd ever had a cat develop diabetes because of an improper diet (i.e. dry foods high in carbs and too low in animal-based proteins) - or any other condition brought on by a poor diet - you'd agree that a little expense up front is way cheaper in the long run than treating the health condition.  The fact that I'm still giving it five stars should tell you something.  Not that I don't recommend shopping around for deals!)<br /><br />Give this food a shot.  It's a very healthful choice.

review/text: Paw Lickin' Chicken is a big favorite with my cats. It's amazing stuff. Looks good enough to put on a crossiant!<br /><br />I use it in rotation with other Weruvas and other brands. When I first served this, my cats ate it like little crazies. Having seen the euphoria, I went out and bought more cans of PLC. I served it all the time and suddenly there was no interest. My epic fail. Too much, too often, equals wasted uneaten cans.<br /><br />I place Weruva's Paw Lickin Chicken on reserve, serving it 2X total (breakfast and dinner) per week, due to the high cost hence one less star in my review.

review/text: Seriously, this stuff actually looks like something humans could eat.  When you open the can, it looks and smells like real (canned) food, not pressed and formed mystery meat or worse, meat paste.  Gluten-free, which has helped reduce the amount of cat barf left in random places or hidden behind couches, etc.  We buy two or three varieties at a time and rotate it through so the cats don't get bored with it.  Pricey, but definitely worth it!

review/summary: Only Food the Babies will Eat!
review/text: I first discovered this product at a local pet food store. Bella and Dora, our adopted kittens, were suffering from a respitory cold that they had picked up from the shelter and were not eating any food.<br /><br />The girl at the shop was really cool and introduced us to the Weruva line of food as well as other brands. I was interested to find out that the owners of Weruva are somehow related to the company that produces all the tuna for Subway Sandwiches. I guess the husband/wife team had cats and were dissapointed to find low quality soft food in the market, and asked to find out what it would take to be able to use the same facilities. They found out that as long as they produced human grade food, they could use the facility. Anyways, we bought a whole bunch of flavors to see what they would like, and ultimately this is the only one that they always finish!<br /><br />I like that you can tell that it is fish, and not some mushed up by product. It smells very fishy, so if that makes you sick just be aware!<br /><br />Hope your kitties love it as much as ours do!!!

review/summary: Weruva is top quality and this flavor is *MY* cats' favorite
review/text: I've tried many different vendors and varieties of canned cat food and this is the favorite for *my* cats' (two of them) by a long shot.  *Your* cats may not like it.  Cats are very finicky!<br /><br />My advice to any reader is to learn about quality pet food (take an hour or two on the web, there's plenty of material to read) and then shop for top quality pet food only (Weruva qualifies in my opinion) and try a small sample until you find a set that YOUR cat likes. Rotate here and there for variety... if your cat likes variety, that is.  Both of my cats hate fish, love poultry and pork, and will tolerate other meats such as beef and lamb, and they both like a little variety.<br /><br />I wish I had fed my cats canned or even raw food from early on but I made the mistake of listening to an indoctrinated vet and fed them "prescription grade" Hill's Science Diet kibble which is total crap as I have come to learn from my own research. Like most doctors with humans and the pharmaceutical companies, many vets become distributors for pet food vendors for financial reasons and won't recommend something that doesn't make them money.<br /><br />I now feed my cats this Weruva flavor and a couple of other quality canned cat foods (they don't care for any other Weruva flavor, by the way) plus a couple of quality kibble brands (high protein, grain-free - no corn, wheat, or soy).

review/text: This is the best cat food on the market, as far as I'm concerned.  All three of my cats gobble it up every day, week after week, month after month.  It's pure white meat chicken breast, shredded, in broth.  The vet recommended it for all of my cats, who have different medical issues.  They love it.  Unfortunately the price has gone up twice since I started buying it. It used to be $32/case, then it went to $35/case, now it's at $37/case.  That's a 15% increase over the past six months.  However, shipping is free, and I order 4 or 5 cases at a time.  They arrive promptly, and I never run out.

review/summary: Our favorite of the premium cat foods
review/text: After researching cat food, we tried quite a few brands and flavors (Merrick, Nature's Variety, Wellness) before settling on this one.<br /><br />What I like about Weruva Chicken is the strip texture instead of paste/pate, and also the very low fat content. While it's ok for cats to eat fat, they get enough from their EVO dry food, so for their wet I prefer low fat and high protein.<br /><br />I hesitate to say our cats love it, cause if I switch to something else for 2 weeks, then back to Weruva Chicken, they forget that they like it. They seem to need 2-3 days of tough love to adjust to any food, even one they previously liked.<br /><br />I wish it was made in USA instead of Thailand, so it's not perfect.<br /><br />It's only about 160 cal/can, but this is due to very low fat, which other premium catfood makers use to boost their caloric content.

It has been so frustrating to get her to eat something, much less actually like it -- with this food she hears the can open and comes and cries for it.  She didn't like the chicken and liver (Nine Livers), but I am sure that flavor is good, too, she is just ridiculously picky.  I gave the chicken and liver to a friend and her two cats loved it.  Thanks for making a food that this cat will actually eat!
