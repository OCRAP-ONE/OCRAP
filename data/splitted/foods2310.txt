review/summary: Don't hesitate - it works!
review/text: My cat used to cough up hairballs on a daily basis, leaving little messes all over the house. My daughter recommended this product to me, so I decided that I might as well give it a try. I specifically got this brand, because another reviewer said it was the best. I bought the original/regular, which is malt flavored. I know that sounds a little weird, but my cat has no problem eating it. I put about half of a teaspoon on his food every night. As long as he gets it on a daily basis, he is fine with little to no coughing and puking. Recently, I ran out of the first tube and we had to wait for the new tube to arrive. That was when I realized what a huge difference it had made. In just a couple of days, my cat went right back to coughing and leaving messes everywhere. As soon as he started on it again, he was completely better after the second dose. I don't know what I will do if they ever stop making this product.<br /><br />My only criticism is that there is an inner seal that is very difficult to remove. I guess it needs to be there, but I do wish the manufacturer could come up with something easier to open.

review/text: I have two cats with long hair and one loves to groom her sister as well as herself, so hairballs could be a problem without Laxatone.  They love it and when I open the tube they come running and lick it right from the tube.  I let them take turn on the tube.

review/text: But my bichon says it's the same thing. Once in a while, he gets a little ack ack in his throat, and the vet said to just give him a tiny bit of this. I think he does it on purpose, just to get a little taste. Seriously, just about a 1/4" to 1/2" from the tube does the trick.

review/summary: Really diminishes the hairball throw-up & Have picky eater cats but found a way to get them to eat this!!
review/text: I have 2 wonderful felines that I consider my babies....but the hairball throw-up was everywhere, they weren't feeling good when it was preparing to come up and it was getting expensive to clean up!!  I've only had this product for about a month and already I'm seeing A LOT of improvement!!!  I'm soooo happy for them and for me!!!  First, my girl kitty is super picky and my guy kitty will eat just about anything but the consistency of this product took them both for a loop.  They wouldn't lick it off my finger or in a bowl with treats or put on their paws either.  So, I tried putting it in their wetfood (they get part of a can for one meal per day for many other reasons but mainly bc of my picky eater kitty).  I lay the wetfood in a layer in their bowl, squeeze the laxatone in the center & fold the outer edges of the wetfood over the center filled laxatone.  They also preferred the regular malt flavor to the tuna one which is interesting bc they prefer all their wetfood to be seafood flavors.  You just have to try different ones and se what your cats will prefer, I guess.  It took them about a week to get used to it but I stuck with it and now they eat it no problem.  I had my concerns that it wouldn't work as well being given with their wetfood but as I said...I've already seen a HUGE difference...where I had to clean up the hairball throw-up normally up to several times a week...now, within the month or so that I've been giving it to them, I've only had to clean it up twice in one whole month!!  I know it'll get even better as I continue to give it to them.  Not only that but they are eating better and I can tell they feel better bc their bathroom movements are much healthier looking (hey, only a mom can say this without cringing and be sincerely happy about this, right?!) and they are moving around with a lighter bounce in their step bc they aren't throwing up as much any more either.  Really glad that my sister, the vet, told me about this product!  And really glad that someone invented a product like this!!

review/text: This is a great product. We have been using this for our cats which we have 5 of and they like to bathe each other and so the fur accumulates inside of them. This product was recommended by our veterinarian along with mineral oil. The combination of the mineral oil and the Laxatone really gets things moving. It might take 2-3 days, but it does work. Great product.

review/summary: runny & cat doesn't like it
review/text: The Laxatone is runny and hard to keep from dripping off of your finger.  My cats love the old Petromalt like it's candy, but won't eat the Laxatone.  The seller (AWORLDOFPUPS) would not take it back because it had been opened. I thought that I could return anything purchased through Amazon within 30 days. I guess not. I suppose the lesson is to stay away from the independent sellers as much as possible.

These treats warranted his "happy dance"; whenever Rooney gets a treat that he really loves he'll bring it to the middle of the living room and dance around it waving and wiggling his butt up in the air before he eats it. We love all of the clear conscience products we've tried, and it's great to know that I'm feeding my dog something that is really good for him and doesn't have any of the extra fillers he doesn't need!

review/summary: A real treat
review/text: I never really liked green tee before but I kept drinking it for it's health benefits. Most recently, I started to like the white tea version of this peachy flavor from Celestial Seasonings, but I was disappointed to find out that they discontinued that product.  Then I realized they had this green tea with peach flavor, and decided to try it.<br /><br />I'm so glad I gave a shot because I like green tea now.  It's much better tasting than plain green tea with a hint of peach. I can drink this a couple of times a day easily.  In my opinion, it's still not as sharp as a good black tea, but it's a close second.<br /><br />By the way, as of the time of this review, the picture on the product page belongs to the discontinued white tea.

They are very good though, they're really good sized, you only need one per cracker, unless you're greedy lol. I really appreciate the bigger size oysters. One time I bought some oysters, I forgot what brand they were but they were so tiny I had to balance a few of them on one cracker which pretty much pissed me off but these are great, you won't be disappointed at all.

review/summary: Best Instant you Can Buy.
review/text: I've tried several brands of instant over the last couple of years. I'm not a heavy coffee drinker anymore so I don't bother to brew it. But I've enjoyed coffee in the past and was a fan of Melitta, Peet's, and otherwise good brands of coffee. When it comes to instant most are drech. They're nearly undrinkable.  I even bought expensive Star Bucks instant and it was the worst I've had. Horribly bitter with a pronounced chemical taste. That seems to be how most instants are. I'm not sure how Jacob's does it but this Instant tastes like fresh brewed coffee. It has a very neutral taste, but very good and clean and inoffensive at the same time. I enjoyed this coffee so much I've convinced other friends to try it and they've enjoyed it as well. Best instant I've had and even better than a lot of fresh roasts as well.

review/summary: Almost as good as brewed...
review/text: My son is headed off to college this fall and expressed an interest in switching from brewed to instant coffee, as a matter of convenience while living in a dorm. I recall the instant coffee of MY college days and was skeptical, as we have been enjoying high-quality, freshly-ground, freshly-brewed coffee for years, but I agreed to do some research. After reading online reviews, I ordered three different kinds of instant coffee: Jacob's Kronung, Starbucks VIA Columbian, and Starbucks VIA Italian. I also picked up a jar of Trader Joe's instant. While all four types far exceeded our expectations, the Jacob's is probably the best of the lot. We brought a jar with us on vacation this past week and both husband and son preferred that over the brewed that was available.<br /><br />I'll definitely keep this as a Subscribe & Save item; in fact, I've requested an extra shipment in the interim so that we can send a couple jars to school with our son.

review/summary: Very good but what's with the price inflation????
review/text: I bought 2 - 7oz jars in Nov., 2011 for $19 total.  Now it's almost $27 with shipping and only 4 months later?  It is very good coffee and I was ready to buy more until I saw this rapid price inflation.  It was definitely the best instant I had tried--thought I'd found something I could just keep re-ordering and enjoying, but this price increase is unfathomable to me.  Other coffees have not gone up in price so quickly.  I'm afraid this price inflation will continue as Jacobs "catches on" more in the US market, so I really don't want to get too attached to it.  Going back to searching for another good instant.<br /><br />I have read some surprisingly positive reviews at Amazon for Nescafe Clasico (of Mexican origin) and they say it's even available at Family Dollar for about $4-5 bucks per 3.5 oz jar.  Sounds too good to be true, but it sure won't cost much to give it a try...  For this review I won't rate Jacobs below 5 stars because my complaint is with the price--not the taste.  It's a nice taste if you don't mind being taken advantage of by the distributor's greediness.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Well, I went to Family Dollar today and bought a jar of Nescafe Clasico and I must say it was really not bad!!  Since I use cream and sugar in my coffee, it doesn't have to be the greatest coffee taste out of the jar, and I think I'll be just as happy with the cheap Nescafe as I was with the expensive JACOBS.  Yeh, I know I'm a bit of a cheapskate, but the taste of the Nescafe was really quite good!

review/summary: I'm a believer!
review/text: I'm a habitual tea drinker and only drink coffee sometimes as a pick-me-up in the morning for work.  Hence, I'm not an avid coffee drinker and usually prefer Folger's with milk & sugar or sweet non-bitter Starbucks coffee with 1/4th cup to 1/3 cup of half & half, sugar & whip cream on top, so I prefer mild coffee.  After reading the reviews and tasting it, i'm a believer!!  The heavy glass bottle container is large but the amount of coffee in it is small to medium.  The first time I made my coffee, I added a lot of it since I remembered everyone said it was mild but the result was that it tasted very bitter & strong, even with lots of milk.<br /><br />The second time I made it, I only added barely 1/4th teaspoon and got great results with the coffee IMMEDIATELy turning dark brown and NOT tasting bitter, exactly as the other reviewers said - very mild, not acidic or caustic.  Instead of Folger's, I'd definitely give it as a gift to someone else who loves mild good coffee.  When I run out, I'll definitely buy more!

review/summary: I love this coffee!
review/text: This is by far my favorite brand of instant coffee. Some Jacobs Kronung with some half&half cream is a great cup of coffee. I love the flavor of this coffee and the aroma is great.<br />I've tried many American brands and most of them taste like soil to me and I just couldn't find any American brand that I liked. So I was really happy when I saw that Amazon has Jacobs coffee in stock since it's not available in any of the grocery stores in my area.<br />The shipping was really fast, and it comes well packaged - each container tightly wrapped in bubble wrap in the box so it doesn't get damaged during shipping. I've ordered from this seller several times and I've always had great service.

I didn't think it was an improvement over Nescafe's "smooth" instant from Target, and it cost far more. However, I like Jacob's Gold much better, and it's often cheaper. Get that one instead, or do what I did and get a little of each and see which suits your prefs better.

review/summary: Different, Not Berry-Like, Not What You'd Expect
review/text: *****<br /><br />St. Dalfour's Organic Strawberry Tea is a black tea with some very slight strawberry overtones---not enough to make it berry-like, but enough to make it different. I enjoyed it very much. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one. So far, this has been my experience with all of the St. Dalfour's teas that I have tried, a big selling point for me since I enjoy my teas very strongly brewed.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />St. Dalfour's Organic Strawberry Tea is a nice variation on plain black tea. Note that black tea does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: One of my favorites!
review/text: I am fairly new to tea. I was a heavy coffee drinker and after reading multiple reports and articles about the benefits of tea along with a desire to cut back on my caffeine a little bit I started to try a bunch of different teas. In the past year I have tried perhaps twenty different types, green, puerh, black, herbal, etc. For the most part I seem to gravitate towards the black teas, I suppose their caffeine is waht I like though it is nowhere near that of coffe. With coffee I would drink a full strong pot and then shake like a leaf and crash hard when the caffeine wore off, the nice part about this stuff is that you can drink it more or less all day long and you never get shakey and I never crash from it afterwords either!! It keeps me feeling alert, is mild tasting, and arromatic. It doesn't taste really of strawberries so much as it smells like them, but it is a very good tea. After buying this one box I came back and bought a bulk pack of six boxes and have already burned through almost half of those. Good stuff!

review/summary: Healthy,  gluten-free,  no cholesterol and very filling. Ways to offset bland taste. A staple in our house.
review/text: This soup is not only high in Vitamin A and C but is great to have on hand for a quick lunch or dinner, either alone with supplemented with bread or crackers and a salad. It is also completely gluten-free.<br /><br />Imagine this: you're hungry, don't have anything on hand, don't want to out and buy groceries. With a 12 pack of this on hand (currently averaging $2.50 a can but a deal because it is so filling), you simply need to open the can, heat it and add whatever you want to offset the low sodium - unless you are on a low-sodium diet. I'm NOT on a low-sodium diet and don't mind the lack of salt. However, if you want a stronger or saltier taste, you can add a bit of regular or garlic salt or salt substitute. I also prefer to add a dollop of sour cream or low-fat yogurt and that makes a HUGE difference. With some crackers, I'm set for lunch or even dinner.<br /><br />Look below for the nutritional content and other benefits but don't overlook those impressive amounts of Vitamin A and C. Sure, you'll need more for your daily requirements but this doesn't have that horrible preservative taste of other canned soups and my whole family loves it. I sometimes add a bit of chicken or vegetable broth and add some lightly sauteed onions or celery. But none of that is necessary. Good to have on hand for power outages, blizzards or times when you need food and the stove won't work. It can be eaten cold in a pinch.<br /><br />Other pros:<br /><br />1. No trans fats, MSG or preservatives. NO GMOS, no bio-engineered ingredients.<br /><br />2. Tastes a bit bland by itself (low sodium) but add some pepper, a bit of salt and a dollop of sour cream and yogurt and it is elevated to a far tastier soup.<br /><br />3. Great to have on hand for emergencies or when you're rushed for time and need a quick meal. Perhaps hearty eaters would want more but I find a can to be totally satisfying and hearty enough to keep me full till dinner or eve as a dinner entree.<br /><br />4. My whole family likes it but they do prefer salt. So take a chance on this and see if your family likes it. If they do, having this on hand could be a major time saver and you'll know they aren't getting trans fats.<br /><br />5. Relatively high vitamin content compared to other commercial soups.<br /><br />Nutritional content (daily values): Vitamin A- 45 percent, Vitamin C - 20 percent, Calcium - 6%, Iron - 15%, Fat - only 4 grams (no trans fat and only .5% of saturated fat), no cholesterol, 340 mg sodium, 24 grams of carbs, dietary fiber 32%, protein - 7 grams, sugars - 5 grams.<br /><br />We find that if we have this soup before a larger meal we don't feel inclined to eat as much. If you are trying to lose weight, this is a plus. Each can is around 360 calories unless you want to stretch this to 2 servings. I don't prefer to do that but if you have toddlers or very young children, half a can should be plenty. I'm sold on this wonderful soup!

review/text: I loved Amy's Lentil vegetable LOW SALT<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G176CI">Amy's Organic Lentil Vegetable Low Salt Soup, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>(as it is currently called) -Product ID  B000G176CI  soup so much that I ordered a second case. When I recieved it, I found that it was not exactly the same as the soup I'd been enjoying so much. Turned out what I ordered was<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1EO64">Amy's Light in Sodium Organic Lentil Soup, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>. The LIGHT was very good, but the Low Salt(this one) was the one I prefered in taste,texture and ingredients. And it wasn't just the small difference in the sodium levels per serving - this one at 340mg, the Light at 290mg - you could always add a tiny bit more or doctor it up if you want with pepper, or Mrs. Dash no salt seasonings - this one just seemed more like a stew and had ingredients the LIGHT did not have. This one has tomatoes and spinach which really adds something extra.And really I found that it needed no doctoring up at all.<br /><br />I liked the Light in Sodium and would recommend it as well to anyone looking to reduce their sodium intake. All Amy's soups are great and made with all organic ingredients. The Lentil soups are also a good source of protien and dietary fiber. They are also a good source of Vit A,and Iron. O Cholesterol, low fat and low sugar as well.<br /><br />You can check the nutritional info(click on link on detail page) and also see all the ingredients and decide for yourself which you want to try, but I wanted to let everyone considering know that there are 2 different lower sodium lentil soups. I prefered this one.It was thicker and just had that little something extra.<br /><br />Also - I found that buying them here by the case saves quite a bit as compared to the individual cans at my local market. You may though, want to try one can of each from your market before deciding on an entire case.<br /><br />Remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy.....Laurie

One was  a case of Amy's Organic soups and tonight I had a big bowl of Lentil Vegetable. It was good. Nice aroma, right out of the can as it was opened. Also smelled good in the microwave. The taste was a little bland and seemed as if it could use a little salt. That's okay. Prepared soups almost always have way too much sodium and the content of this soup was acceptable. It was  a good soup and was loaded with fiber and had a goodly protein content. Nice soup.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I have enjoyed this soup for years, and find it both very tasty and filling.<br /><br />In fact, when I have it for lunch (with just a couple of oat crakers), I don't need to eat anything else, so it's helping me to lose weight!<br /><br />I never feel weighed down by this soup, nor have the salt reaction that I have with saltier soups, but instead feel really well nourished.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Pretty good, not spicy
review/text: I tried this out looking for low sodium soups and found it to be pretty good.  It is not that spicy, and has a large amount of carrots in it.  (Wish about 3/4 of the carrots was more lentil's)<br /><br />I add some jalapenos or tobasco to it when heating it up to give it a little more bite.

review/summary: One of the best Amy's Soups
review/text: I don't remember what I paid for this in the grocery store (I didn't buy it on Amazon, I'm just reviewing the soup itself) but it was more expensive than most soups. I got it at Big Y and it was almost 4 dollars, which is REALLY pricey for soup, organic or not. Other than the price, I really liked this soup. Amy's has always been very hit or miss for me and most of their soups are really bland and need added ingredients.  SInce soup is supposed to be easy I'd just rather a soup I can simply heat up without having to worry about adding anything other then maybe some salt and pepper...this soup worked for that. I found it to be more flavorful then other Amy's soups and it was also really filling.

review/summary: Like the soup, hate the dents
review/text: I don't like most canned soups because most of them contain far too much sodium. I try to avoid sodium both for health reasons and because I don't like the salty taste. I like the taste of this soup, but like a lot of other reviewers I was disappointed that so many of the cans were dented.

review/summary: great soup, great for you, cans UN-dented
review/text: I loved this soup when I got it in the store.  Once I saw it was on amazon, thought I'd try stocking up and saving a few bucks.  I did read about others who got dented cans, and was hesitant, but figured I'd try it and see.  Amazon must have cared about customer feedback because the cans arrived in a box packed with air pouches, AND the soup itself was enveloped in very sturdy taped bubble wrap.  I would have been surprised if I hadn't seen the dented can reviews, but it made sense that they did something significant to address the issue.  Great idea!

review/text: While I enjoyed the soup itself, I must join the other reviewers who complained about DENTED CANS.  Yes, 9 out of the 12 cans in my last shipment were slightly to moderately DENTED.  Ugh!  Is Amy's unloading its dented cans on unwitting Amazon customers?  Anyway, folks, this item is not eligible for return but a very accommodating customer service agent just gave me a refund.  I will not buy this item from Amazon again, due to this DENTED CAN issue.  I will pay a little more and get it from one of the other online health food stores that will ship me an undented can.

review/summary: AMY'S LOW SALT LENTIL SOUP
review/text: I ordered the following Amy's Low Salt Products: Lentil Soup, Pea Soup, Minestrone Soup, and Medium Chili.  All of them are great.  If you are just now switching to Low salt or no salt you may find them to be bland until your body adjusts to the lowered salt intake (that could take months or up to a year).  The biggest complaint most have is the dented cans.  My Minestrone and Chili came in without any dents, the Pea Soup had 2 dented cans and the Lentils had dents in every can.  These dents are not caused by shipping.  All of my shipments came in with the packages totally intact with no signs that the outer shipping box had been roughed up in shipment.  These dents are caused by Amazon or Amy's warehousing.  The cans are not in boxes, they are shrink wrapped so when stacked the cans are actually bearing the weight.  Too much weight and the cans begin to buckle and this buckling will look like dents.  You can also get this same effect if the warehousemen are slamming the 12 pack cans down hard on top of each other.  This happens when workers in the warehouse get tired and become careless, are untrained, or just plain don't care about their job.  If you want to feel better then stay on a low salt diet, if you have ankle swelling then get on a low salt diet and get checked for congestive heart failure.  If you have high blood pressure get on a low salt diet and then increase your intake of magnesium.  Backing off your salt is not easy as it begins to change the way you taste food but if you stay with it and get off the high salt diet you will begin to taste food and not just the salt.  Have you ever eaten at a restaurant where the cook's salt intake is so high that the cook can't tell if he has too much salt in the food he is preparing?  I have more than once and it just destroys the meal.  Instead of buying 12 cans now try the Amy's Low Salt by getting it at your local health food store one can at a time then if you like order from Amazon and save.  Right now they have a 25% discount code when you order.  Write it down and use it as it saved me a few bucks.  Hope this review helps you.

review/summary: YUM
review/text: I love all of Amy's products. As a vegan with food sensitivities that is always on the go, I really appreciate the fact that Amy's offers a large variety of organic foods and labels their food well (gluten free, vegan, non-dairy, contains nuts, etc.) so it's easy to tell whether or not I can eat their products. I love soups, but canned soups tend to have an entire day's worth of sodium. Amy's low sodium varieties have a more reasonable sodium content, but are also flavorful and don't make me think I accidentally ventured into a retirement home for lunch. The Lentil Vegetable is absolutely delicious and incredibly filling. It's a great option when I want something light that will keep me full for several hours. Amy's low sodium soups are a staple in my pantry and I would recommend them to anyone that is health-conscious.

review/text: This soup with reduced sodium is the desired path to soup nirvana. It's the best lentil variety I've ever sampled. It's less at Stop N Shop but you have to carry home 12 unattached cans, so the free delivery to your door via Amazon is enticing and desired. I'm not a vegetarian but I do adore hot soup during the winter. Amy also markets a strictly lentil soup which they sell at Costco, but the reduced sodium content with the vegetable addition is much better.

review/summary: Amy's Two Lentil Soups: Both Called Light in Sodium, None called Low Salt
review/text: I have had both of Amy's lentil soups and liked them very much, but I am writing this review to correct a misunderstanding contained in an earlier review by another customer (July 29, 2010).<br /><br />There are two Amy's lentil soups.  One is "Organic Lentil Soup - Light in Sodium" and contains 290mg sodium per serving, the other is "Organic Lentil Vegetable Soup - Light in Sodium" and contains 340 mg sodium per serving. Please note that the first is Lentil and the second is Lentil Vegetable.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Amys-Sodium-Organic-Lentil-14-5-Ounce/dp/B000G1EO64/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=grocery&qid=1288868059&sr=1-2<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Amys-Organic-Lentil-Vegetable-14-5-Ounce/dp/B000G176CI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=grocery&qid=1288868059&sr=1-3<br /><br />There is no Amy's soup, lentil or other, called "Low Salt".  That is an Amazon error.  Look closely at the product pages for "Low Salt" soups. You will see that Amazon's product heading reads "Low Salt" but the product photo is of a can labeled "Light in Sodium".  If necessary you can also check Amy's website.  There are no "Low Salt" soups listed.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients for both soups.  I copied them from Amy's website, so the upper case and misspelled words are theirs, not mine.<br /><br />Organic Lentil Soup- Light in Sodium:<br />INGREDIENTS : NO TRANS FAT  NO ADDED MSG  NO PRESERVATIVES (VEGAN) ORGANIC LENTILS, FILTERED WATER, ORGANIC CELERY, ORGANIC CARROTS, ORGANIC ONIONS, ORGANIC POTATOES, ORGANIC EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL, SEA SALT, SPICES*. *100% PURE HERBS & SPICES (NO HIDDEN INGREDIENTS)<br /><br />Organic Lentil Vegetable Soup - Light in Sodium:<br />INGREDIENTS : NO TRANS FAT  NO ADDED MSG  NO PRESERVATIVES (VEGAN) FILTERED WATER, ORGANIC ONIONS, ORGANIC LENTILS, ORGANIC CARROTS, ORGANIC CELERY, ORGANIC POTATOS, ORGANIC TOMATOES, ORGANIC SPINACH, ORGANIC GREEN BEANS, ORGANIC EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL, ORGANIC GARLIC, SEA SALT, ORGANIC BALSAMIC VINEGAR, SPICES*, ORGANIC BLACK PEPPER. *100% PURE HERBS & SPICES (NO HIDDEN INGREDIENTS)

review/summary: Terrible! Terrible! Terrible!
review/text: These Wine Gums are a travesty, whose only vaguely comparable aspect to Maynard's Wine Gums is that their title contains the words "gums" and "wine".<br /><br />I bought these in a store in Ann Arbor, MI, and I wish I had never parted with the cash.  Frankly, the manufacturer should be supported by the Chocolate candy industry as a useful tool in their marketing arsenal to ward people from ever trying anything that did not broadly contain chocolate, and towards their own advertised products.<br /><br />They are effectively some kind of gum, that has been colored.  Nothing more.  They are flavorless, and seem more like they were the very first attempt to make Wine Gums while the company were just working towards the right consistency - an effort still clearly in progress.  I'd brand these 'Wine Gums version 0.001'!<br /><br />Maynard's - despite not being the gold-standard - are still massively better than these, and anyone looking to partake of true Wine Gums will find a better experience going with that variety.

review/summary: My Dog Likes Natural Planet Better than Steak!
review/text: Over the past few years, my dog Gracie has been sick a lot with chronic urinary tract infections. When she starts to get sick, she stops eating her current food. Eventually we went through every type of canned and dry food at the supermarket. Then I started feeding her actual human food. She liked ground beef, steak, and chicken well enough, but she wasn't thrilled by it. I got a sample of Natural Planet Organics dry food and she gobbled it up as fast as she could.<br /><br />Now that I'm feeding it to her, it doesn't look like she's getting tired of it -- like she did with other food -- and she's looking better and healthier than she's done for a year. If I give her a choice between Natural Planet and raw or cooked chicken breast or beef, she chooses Natural Planet instead.

review/text: Green Mountain Dark Magic DECAF Extra Bold Coffee for Keurig Brewers is excellent tasting coffee. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars would be the price. If it were less expensive it would be great.

review/text: Not rich enough.  I use four ounces of water to be drinkable. I like a much darker roast.  For regular coffee I like Starbucks French roast.  Does Starbucks not make a Dark roast decaf?.

review/summary: Best Decaf on the market
review/text: Full bodied and robust this decaf lives up to its name. Taste much like the very best European coffee. You wouldn't think it's Decaf.<br />My favorite blend and I tried them all after I got my Keurig.<br />For a little lighter touch but still flavorfull try the Donut House Decaf.

review/text: Have used this product for several years and found it to be the single best supplement for use in losing or maintaining weight and correct metabolism levels.  Keeps the appetite under control with a proprietary blend of natural herbal boosters and nutrients that, when used with a healthy diet plan, has a dual action effect on weight loss.  And lastly, it is priced well.
