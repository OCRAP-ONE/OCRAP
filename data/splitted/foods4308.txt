review/summary: Okay taste, but pricely
review/text: The question about any product is always, Is it worth it's price? Here, no. THe tea's taste is reviewed elsewhere, so check it out, and maybe it's standard practice by certain connie suers to ignore price, but I never do. I gave it a try, like it, but won't buy it again. Tastes tannicky. I'll stick to Barry's, and that's double what Trader Joe's Irish Breakfast cost, which is pretty good itself.

review/summary: Just Plain Nasty
review/text: When I was a child, I was fascinated with pyracantha berries: the bright shiny skin over a white, dryish chalky something.  These dried blueberries reminded me of that childhood fascination.  Why?  Because they are dry and chalky.  Actually, it's more like sand or saw dust.  A previous reviewer indicated that they were too sweet.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to the point that I could tell if they were sweet or not.  My mouth was too busy rebelling over the dryness of the blueberries.<br /><br />I've been so happy with every other product, that I've tried, from Oskri, that I made the assumption that these would be just as good.  Not even close.  They are simply dreadful.

review/summary: blueberry surprise
review/text: The dehydrated blueberries that I usually purchase were unavailable, so I looked for a substitute that was "just blueberries", nothing else listed on the ingredients.  This item appeared to meet that criteria.  Unfortunately, when the product arrived, it was not only berries, but also oil and sweetener.  Instead of plumping up when rehydrated in my morning milk, they did not change at all.  They were much more a sweet snack than a true blueberry flavor.  If you are looking for a "sweetened blueberry with oil" snack, this might be for you, but if you are looking for "dried fruit" as in dehydrated fruit, this is definitely not it.

review/summary: Wild Turkey American Honey loses track of the taste of both the bourbon AND the honey.
review/text: I love Wild Turkey bourbon, so I was rooting for American Honey to be a honey.  It wasn't.  A lovely straw yellow gold in the glass, the mouthfeel was thick as syrup.  The initial taste was simple syrup.  By midpalate we had a medicinal lemony sweetness that didn't taste like either bourbon or honey at all.  Aftertaste was all citrusy sweetness.  It wasn't undrinkable.  I could see putting it into cola (particularly Pepsi, which has a lemon aromatic). However the lack of bourbon taste and the failure to capture the taste of honey disappointed me.  Something with the "Wild Turkey" name should taste like Wild Turkey bourbon.

review/summary: I make 3 gallons at a time.
review/text: For many years, I have been buying this tea from Amazon.  The quality, freshness and price are excellent.  At home, I boil 3 gallons of water and drop 14 bags into it and let it steep.  It would probably be better to pour the water into the tea bags, but it would be too inconvenient.  After it cools a bit, I pour the tea into approximately 18 clean Arizona Iced Tea bottles, Snapple bottles, Nantucket Nectar bottles, and a collection of other bottles that I have collected for this purpose.  I place the bottles in the refrigerator, and enjoy the tea as I want it.  I always have a cold bottle ready, and friends often stop over looking for iced decaf green tea.  After trying many brands, I find that Celestial Seasonings has the best taste.  In my office, I brew one or two bottles at a time.  Although I often drink the tea hot, my drink of choice is iced Celestial Seasonings decaf green tea (with Sweet & Low added).  I highly recommend this tea.

review/summary: Disappointing for green tea
review/text: This decaf green, like every other brand I've tried so far, is not green in color and is missing that light, fresh, "green" flavor of a good caffeinated Japanese-style tea.  I'd say it is actually a bit smoky, sort of like a Chinese-style green tea, which is not what I'm looking for.  I like smoky green teas, like Hojicha, but I don't like that flavor in plain green tea.  I've drunk green tea my whole life and tried many kinds from restaurants, groceries and Asian markets, and this one just doesn't do it for me.  It was surprising given the glowing reviews at Amazon that influenced my decision to buy it.  So far Stash's decaf has been the best, but I'll keep searching for better.

review/summary: Excellent value, smooth taste
review/text: This tea is naturally decaffeinated without the use of chemical solvents.<br /><br />It also has added white tea, which the box says is for a smoother taste. White tea is loaded with powerful anti-oxidants (much more so than green tea). So, I considered it a bonus to be able to have both in one cup. This does affect the flavor, though. There isn't a lot of depth to this green tea, which I believe the other reviewers have alluded to.<br /><br />Each box of 40 comes shrink wrapped. Inside the box, there is a pouch with 40 tea bags. They are not individually wrapped, and they do not have the string/tag most tea bags have. They are in pairs, so if you like your tea strong, just use two at a time. Otherwise, you'll need to separate them. The label states they have saved lots of trees by not using extra packaging. I think it's great, so long as you drink the tea in a timely manner. Otherwise, you might want to consider keeping the tea in an air-tight container to maintain freshness.

It's filling, it's not too sweet (which was a problem before the teeth came out because one was very sensitive to sweets), and it's easy to make. My mother also eats a lot of this, she had cancer of the tongue two years ago and after undergoing radiation has had a lot of problems eating many foods. This is something that's very easy for her to swallow and helps soothe some of the pain she gets occasionally. I also enjoyed the cheesecake flavor - we experimented with this for a birthday cake and used it in lieu of frosting. It had a great texture for that. Whether you're serving it as a dessert or you're on a limited diet where you can only eat soft foods, this is a great choice.

I actually stumbled upon this product while I was in Korean Town, the price was about $8 there. Most off-line Asian grocers are a lot cheaper when you're looking for something like this. But if you don't live near them, I suppose this is the way to go. Anyway this matcha green tea powder really makes perfect home versions of Starbuck's green tea frappuccino, or the ones of JB's. There are higher-end grade powdered green tea out there, but this is perfect for numerous recipes. Oh, and I agree with the previous reviewer about how the little goes a LONG way. :)

Difficult to dissolve. Less favorable flavor and not organic<br /><br />Uwajimaya has best selection of Matcha teas with several others I have not tried yet. Whole Foods carries both DO and Tao of Tea. New Seasons currently does not carry Matcha. Serendipi is available on Amazon for $17/4 oz. box, best tea for your money!

review/summary: Ok candy..
review/text: When i first ordered this candy i was hoping for a little spiciness, but it tasted mostly sweet. The 2nd thing i did not like was that every piece of candy were very small and they came inside small plastic so it was frustrating to open them every time. The final problem was that only the outside part of the candy tasted good but the inside part just ruins the taste and i end up throwing it in the garbage can. So i would not recommend this candy to anyone.

review/text: I try to keep my diet over 50% raw, and GoRaw's products help with that a great deal.  Their Simple Granola is my favorite because it doesn't have raisins and their regular granola does. Personal preference. It's by far my favorite cereal, including regular cereals I grew up on.  I either buy almond milk or make it myself.  Fast, delicious, filling and nutritious! I hope Amazon gets this one back in stock soon! It takes a long time to pick those raisins out of the other bags!

review/summary: THE BEST DOGGIE SNACK OUT THERE
review/text: Ny husband thinks these doggie treats are good enuf for human consumption. He swears they have chocolate (NOT) in them ..... but we have not tasted them!<br /><br />The 'kids' love them. We have 2 cockapoos. The female poo has such a delicate stomach/intestinal tract.  We have had many issues.  She will not touch doggoe treats --- She seems to understand they aren't good for her system.  BUT, Liver Biscottis are different!!!  She likes them and looks forward to her snacks.  Our male poo will eat anything yet he loves the crunch factor of these treats.<br /><br />We have never had any issues with Liver Biscottis except the SIZE OF THE PIECES.  BEWARE of the size that you buy!  And, once upon a time, the picture did not match the words, did not match the product size.  Slivers are nothing more than food supplement.  Not treat size or training size.

review/text: I'm an American and had heard of, but never tried this stuff. Well thanks to the magic of the internet I decided that it was time to see what was up with all this Australian hoopla and get some for myself.<br /><br />When it arrived, with much trepidation, I made some toast, added copious amounts of whipped margarine, and then carefully scraped a blob of Vegemite onto it and mixed it around. And then I ate it.<br /><br />Its a very salty type stuff, with a flavor reminiscent of soy sauce and/or beef bullion, and maybe mushrooms. All I can think of is that this is like instant biscuits and gravy in a spreadable form.<br /><br />Weird but kind of good. I'd get it again!

review/text: Well, curiosity finally got to me to see what the Vegemite sandwich was all about. Its made by Kraft in Australia. Its all good and wholesome. Now, to describe this yeast by product. The best way I can describe it is...it's like a very salty, beef bullion-flavored, brown cheese whiz with a very thick consistency. I actually have come to like the flavor of it. It's just so salty. I have not figured out a way to use it so I will just keep eating a bit of it now and then. I think it has a pretty long shelf life.

One problem, it's rather high in sodium.<br />Fortunately, it's not a large jar so it's likely I can manage to finish it.<br />Actually, it was somewhat difficult as to give an accurate rating so for reasons I'm unable to come up with I'm giving it three stars, don't ask me why. Maybe it's the cute little jar with the yellow cover but for taste it gets one star.

It's unusual for me not to like something-I'm not really picky about much.I really love Bob's Red Mill "Mighty Tasty". I also love Cream of Rice.  I hope I can give it away to someone who will use it up, because I now have 4 boxes and just can't eat it.  I fixed it both in the microwave and on the stove. I doctored it up with butter, pecans and maple syrup and still didn't like it. Then I tried it with butter and cheddar cheese-no luck. Maybe I'll try using milk instead of water.Does anyone have any suggestions?

review/text: With the new scare on arsenic levels in rice, I did several hours of research and found that different parts of the US that grow rice had different levels of arsenic in the soil which the rice then soaked up. I am feeding my 6 month old son brown rice cereal and am very concerned about the arsenic levels I read about. I bought this brand and after learning the rice they use is grown in Texas, and that Texas is listed as one of the higher arsenic levels, I am returning this product and purchasing Bobs Red Mill organic Brown rice farina. This rice is grown in California which is listed as the least arsenic levels (almost undetectible). I tried Quinoa and my son didn't like it. He's a little too young for oatmeal but that will be our next adventure. Just thought you would all like to know this information. Good health to everyone

I added amber agave nectar as a sweetener, chopped walnuts, and cinnamon. D-lish! I normally eat steel cut oats, so this will be a nice alternative. So wonderful.

review/summary: It's a staple in my house
review/text: I'm restricted to gluten-free food products. I've tried other brands when this would disappear off the shelf in my local market. The others were worse than unappealing -- They smelled and tasted like paper mache' paste. So I took to ordering this by the case from my local health food store. I switched to Amazon's subscription to receive it because it costs less per box and I only have to get 4 at a time (I don't have to figure out where to keep 12 boxes).<br /><br />The subscription service is GREAT! You choose how often to receive delivery. When delivery time comes up, you have the option to delay it if you want, and there's no shipping charge. I now receive several items in this manner because it's less expensive and I don't have to worry about them not being on the store shelf when I need them.<br /><br />Case to case, the cereal can be a bit inconsistent, not in flavor but I find I may have to adjust the cooking time a little bit (a difference of seconds) to get the consistency in texture that I like.<br /><br />I DEFINITELY recommend this product and hope I never have need to smell paper mache' in my kitchen again!

review/summary: Great chip that is different from the rest
review/text: I like the puffed nature of this chip that makes it more unique in the chip market.  I ordered the Salt and Vinegar and absolutely love that flavor, hands down my favorite chip ever.  I have tried the cheddar and regular flavors as well.  The cheddar is about a 4/5 and the regular is about a 3/5 because I prefer strong flavors and obviously that would not be the case for the regular.  The Salt and Vinegar is kind of weak compared to some regular S&V chips, but is quite flavorful and makes you wanting to come back for more.

review/summary: Great  Alternative to Potato Chips
review/text: I just love these chips!  I was always a big fan of potato chips, but haven't had one since I discovered popchips.  They are great for dipping or all alone.  I am constantly re-ordering them.  One note however-if you are on a low salt diet these chips are probably not for you. They are high in sodium.  We go through a case every two months.  If you love them it pays to join the subscribe and save program through Amazon.  You save money and stay supplied!

review/text: I love this brand of chips. By far, I like the cheddar potato the best. Second in line is the sour cream, and third is the BBQ. I recently bought 12 bags of Cheddar on Amazon!<br />These are much better than those baked chips out on the market (in my opinion). Oh, and an FYI, these are way better than rice cakes-people keep comparing the two and I totally disagree).<br />The 0.8 oz bag is perfect single size (pretty generous actually).<br />Yummy!

review/summary: Awesome healthIER snack option!
review/text: I first had Popchips last week at a local deli in Miami. I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind.

review/summary: A lower calorie alternative to standard chips: 120 calories/oz. A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored
review/text: The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of "there must be something better".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per "serving"), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word "puff" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed "all natural". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them.

The other flavors weren't so great (salt & pepper and cheddar aren't too bad) but this one rocked.

review/summary: Great Chips Less Fat
review/text: I eat chips almost every day and decided I wanted to find something that tastes as good but is lighter on unnecessary fat than regular types of chips. I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of "regular" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor.

review/summary: Best "healthy" salt and vinegar chip out there
review/text: I am always on the hunt for a good lower fat salt and vinegar chip and I have to say, it is a very hard thing to find! I actually wrote to Pringles once and asked if they had any plans to make a reduced fat salt and vinegar chip...to my disappointment, they said no. For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange. I have tried a couple baked salt and vinegar chips from small brands and they were all disgusting in flavor and texture. This is the only way to go that I have found so far. I would recommend it.<br /><br />Yes, I know, I appear to be obsessed with S&V chips...it is a little scary.

review/text: I love these salt and pepper flavored Popchips.  The bag size is perfect for a snack.  I love them in the afternoon when I get home from work, or at lunch with a sandwich.  Of course since they are "salt and pepper", there's a lot of salt.  I have to watch my sodium intake and it limits the number of bags I can eat.  Also, I would like to see the salt and pepper flavor included in the variety box instead of the vinegar, which I don't like at all.  Tastes too strong of vinegar.  Would be great for someone who absolutely loves vinegar.  It would also be nice if you could create your own variety box with the flavors you most prefer.  It does get a little boring eating 24 bags the same flavor.

That is because they are hot air popped and not fried. I almost ate the whole bag on my first taste; by the way it was the huge Costco size bag, twice the size of their large bags. With in two days I was back at Costco to by another bag. Like I said I just love these chips!

review/text: Can not find them locally yet. Much better than baked!! Only 100 calories per bag. Get the variety pack so you can decide which you like best. I think the vinegar salt, sour cream onion, and the barb-q are the best. Shipping is very fast.

review/text: After reading the reviews I decided to take advantage of the special Amazon was offering.  Wow!  Excellent chip and of course you can enjoy it more knowing it has no cholesterol or saturated fat.  Fortunately the bags are small which helps you control your calorie intake.  But, they are highly addictive.  I have only tried the regular, but I will definitely be ordering some of the other flavors later on.  I recommend that every one try them, although at regular price they are quite expensive.
