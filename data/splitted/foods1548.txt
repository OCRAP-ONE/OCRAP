review/summary: Get Your Fiber the Pleasant Way
review/text: I knew nothing about Kind Bars, until I saw them on QVC. Since I must be on a high fiber diet due to a colon problem, I tried them. After the first box, I was "hooked". These are the best tasting fiber bars I've ever had. The ones in the markets are good, but Kind Bars are the best. I use them as a once a day snack or desert. If I use it as a snack, I follow with 8 oz., water. I feel as satisfied as if I had a full meal. My favorite is almonds and cranberry. They are not too sweet, but just right for my taste. Another thing that I like about them is, they are moist and the nuts are easy to chew, not hard. If you like nuts, cranberries and honey, you'll love Kind Bars. MAK

review/summary: Very tasty bars
review/text: There are many varieties of bars on the market these days.  I like Kind Plus and tried several varieties.  They have almonds, not peanuts as other brands have and this makes a big difference.  They taste grate and very fulfilling.  Each bar still has 12 gram of sugar, so be careful and do not eat too many at once, but one a day as between meals snack is OK : )

review/summary: best ever snack or breakfast bars
review/text: These bars taste good and have all the right things in them (like almonds and cranberries, etc) that let you know they are doing your body good.  These bars were better tasting than other snacks I have eaten.  They are packed with good stuff that help keep your blood sugar balanced (I am hypoglycemic with fibromyalgia and a few other mechanical issues) and your energy stays up there.  This may have me making it a major part of my daily regime. These bars keep actually full me up for a while too.  They come in a smaller size which I am going to get just to stick in my purse for those sugar drops that leave you shaking and dizzy!! and of course for fighting those hunger pangs between meals.

Just the right flavor and amazing if you like dates and almonds (I love them).<br />Sometimes I feel I could eat many but then it fills you up just right to not crave for too many.<br />I love this particular flavor and also the cranberry one they have.<br />It seems like a total value for money item and they also were prompt at shipping it.

review/text: I'm excited to try the other KIND bars. I am looking for a low carb and more natural snack bars and I think KIND is a very good choice for that. The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is pretty good, although I haven't found a great number of cashews. I've had it in rather hot places and it does kind of lose its shape. That's annoying. Purchasing it through amazon.com was a breeze, I enjoyed having 12 at once and saving. This stuff is okay to buy in bulk because you can consume it so quickly.

review/text: At 190 calories, these bars provide a great calorie boost with very healthy ingredients.  Cranberries and almonds have loads of healthy benefits and naturally combining them into a convenient bar is definitely a one of a KIND product.  I am very satisfied with the taste and they are my friends' favorite choice when grabbing a snack to go from the pantry.  They have a short ingredient list compared to similar bars.  Purchasing through subscribe and save makes the amazon price the lowest I could find and very reasonable per bar.

review/text: I like this bar.  It does have an initial interesting taste, but I'm sure it's the mac nuts in it.  I would buy it again.  It is VERY moist and sticky - which is good cause it won't dry out your mouth like a lot of bars do.  I think I'd like to try other flavors as well.  I let a co-worker try it and she said, "it tastes like lip gloss".  I'm not sure how she got that opinion, but thought I'd put that in my review.  It is different from any other bar that I've eaten; sesame seeds, mac nuts, etc.

review/summary: Very healthy
review/text: I dont really worry about my weight these days.  These bars are not exactly low calorie, though, in the writeup I read on the internet I , the guy who created the product says he sometimes eats a couple  of them for lunch. That's about right, it would be a tasty light on-the-go lunch at 420 calories. So much better for you than a candy bar. I read an interview the magazine about the founder of the company, and it inspired me to try other bars also, where they are selling them everywhere . I loved it. The one I sampled was different from this one, but this one sounded like I would enjoy it even more, and I did.

review/summary: Good Stuff!
review/text: A friend gave me a couple of these "energy" type bars last year and I immediately liked them a lot. But the prices at the local health stores and bicycle/mountain stores prohibited me from buying them as much as I wanted to. Amazon stepped in and I bought them by the box at a very decent price.<br /><br />I like to have them on bicycle rides and I'll eat one half-way through and I feel a little "lift" immediately afterward.<br /><br />Taste good, filling - ya oughta get some.

review/summary: TASTY CHOCOLATE TREAT
review/text: These bars do not qualify as high protein or health bars, but exceed in the taste department. Contain all natural ingredients, which will give you instant energy for that tennis game or other favorite sport. Not recommended as trail bars, because heat will melt the dark chocolate in the bar. Can be refrigerated. The three main ingredients are almonds, dark chocolate and cherries, in that order. They do contain some added vitamins. Recommended.

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: I ordered the Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew bars and I was pleasantly surprised how good they tasted. My husband likes them and so does my daughter. The only thing is I wished they had a little less sugar. The nutritional facts say they have 14g of sugar. Now 14 grams of sugar is not bad if you are comparing it to a candy bar but for a nutritional bar I would ideally like 10g of sugar or less.

review/summary: I've finally found "my" bar
review/text: I've been some combination of nursing and/or pregnant for a few years now, and trying to find time for a meal when chasing after a toddler or when morning sickness gives you many reasons to avoid every food on earth can be a real challenge. Because of this I sometimes feel like my pantry is some sort of test cabinet for a nutritional bar company. There are always at least a few kinds in there, ones that I've tried before and like and ones that I'm trying out for the first time. I finally got around to trying Kind Bars after all this time, and this specific flavor is officially on my "that's it, you've found a gold medal winner" list.<br /><br />There's usually something for my picky side to take issue with, but not this time. I love that they have extra protein, as they really manage to leave me feeling full and satisfied if I end up turning to one in place of lunch. The fact that it was packed with nuts made me suspect that I would find it too crunchy, but it has the perfect level of chewiness with a really pleasing-but-not-overpowering crunch. Unlike their sister bars (Passion Fruit Macadamia + B Complex, which I purchased at the same time) these are not cloyingly sweet. Don't get me wrong, they have sweetness, but I find that it's just the right amount-- you're tasting the nuts and other good things with just a bump of sweetness to help it along.<br /><br />I bought one box to try them out, now I'm back to load up on them while they are on sale. I'm going to be keeping these as my main bar with one or two other favorites for occasional variety. If you are the kind of person that is always on the lookout for a quick meal or snack fix, I really can't recommend this specific bar more!

review/summary: Deceptive labeling for glorified peanut bars
review/text: I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description. It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond, walnut and macadamia, especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list. Maybe they think that people can't tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts?<br /><br />I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK, but I have a hard time believing that the 4.5 star rating the product currently receives hasn't been created by company shills.<br /><br />It is a shame too, since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description. If I had only ordered these I likely would never have purchased another product from KIND PLUS.

review/text: I knew this was a tasty flavor of Kind bars.  They are hard to find in stores, so I ordered two boxes.  My mistake was ordering them in the SUMMER, for delivery to Virginia.  They arrived in a very melty state.  They recovered, more or less, and became bar-shaped again and don't have an off taste.  However, the chocolate is changed in texture and I have to eat these bars while leaning over the sink or a plate to catch chocolate schnitzels that fly around!<br />DON'T ORDER THESE IN SUMMERTIME!!!!

review/summary: No sulphur dioxide!
review/text: These bars are soooooo good.  My daughter has asthma which can be triggered by sulphur dioxide and these bars don't use this chemical to preserve the dried fruit. The bars are not hard or crunchy but they are not chewy either.  Texture is kinda like a snickers bar.  Easy on the teeth.  Everyone in my family has loved these bars.  I thought the price was a little high but now that I've tasted them, they are completely worth it.  I used to buy Clif organic Z bars which weigh 36g and these are little bigger at 40g and much better tasting and more nutritious.<br /><br />Update:  I've downgraded my rating because I just bought the peanut butter dark chocolate + protein and it contains soy protein isolates which are difficult to digest and can cause GI distress.  I heard one of the owners of the company on a podcast (Romy Nelson) talking about the cons of this very protein and why they did not use it about a year ago.  What gives!

review/text: These are delicious, especially if you like cranberries and almonds. The cranberries are not too tart or sour, so they provide a nice sweetness to the bar. The whole almonds while delicious make it a little harder to chew, so if you've got fragile teeth buyer beware. I switched to these for a while from the macadamia and mango ones, which are also great, and I noticed a bigger energy boost from these, the cranberry ones. A great product. Bit pricey though, at $1.50 a bar.

Overall, just a great and healthy snack to keep on hand.

I plan on ripping through the rest of the flavors over the next few months as they go on sale.

The other flavors came from a different seller and arrived in great condition, even though they were sent in the same shipment as the defective box.  I won't bother with the hassle of attempting to return them, especially since I ate one of the bars before I realized there was a problem with the entire box.  A real waste of money.

review/summary: Probably the best nutritional bar I've had thus far
review/text: KIND bar is little like fine dinning, they don't give you a huge portion, and its quite expensive compared to others, but the portion they give you is so good. This is one of the few health bar that doesn't give you that sugar high and then nap time afterward.<br /><br />As a working individual that logs a lot of hours behind a monitor, sometime it is difficult to grab a meal when you are in the middle of something. So for the past few years, I've been stashing a collection of nutritional bar at my desk. Usually, that stash consist of items on sale from either Amazon or Vons. I've many different bars, from Clif Bar, Nature Valley's Granola Bar, to Balance Bar. None of them can compare to KIND bar. I've actually never heard about this company until a sale on Amazon, but due to great reviews. Which is why I want to put in my 2 cents as well.

review/summary: Great All Natural Bar
review/text: Purchased one out one day and really enjoyed it.  Found them on Amazon and ordered this flavor, which is my favorite and Coconut.  These bars taste great & are not like other protein or natural bars I have tried in the past.  I would recommend these bars for a quick snack, after work out or even breakfast.

review/text: I just tried these for the first time and they're fantastic!  Absolutely delicious and filling.  A bar in the morning with a cup of green tea and I'm good to go.  I liked them so much I handed them out to co-workers who immediately wanted to know where to get them.  I'm ready to order a box of every flavor!

review/text: These KIND bars are indulgently delicious.  Who can go wrong with Mangos and Macadamia Nuts?  I save this flavor for when I really want something special!  I've shared them with a colleague who actually moaned with pleasure when he tasted the first one!  (And he's not a person who is easily pleased by anything!)  Food for the G-d or G-dess in all of us!

review/text: I came across these bars while at Starbucks and was really hungry and decided to give one a try.  From the first bite I knew I was hooked, they are so delicious and healthy for you! I love the fact that they are high in fiber and have Omega.  I highly recommend these bars to anyone looking for a healthy snack.  If you have a sweet tooth grab one of these as a healthy option rather than a chocolate bar.

review/summary: A new favorite for me!
review/text: I really enjoy these bars.  I ordered the cashew-almond bars as well, but much prefer the cranberry/almond.  The cranberry just adds that extra bit of flavor, plus I have a sweet tooth.  I am a borderline diabetic, and I like how these bars are low-glycemic. The last thing I need is a sugar rush.

review/summary: very good but
review/text: These bars are moist and delicious. They aren't too small or too big and leave you feeling satisfied. They aren't full of too many or unknown ingredients. You can taste the fruit and nuts clearly. However, I find them high in fat/saturated fat and calories for their size, and quite sugary on the teeth.

review/summary: Scrumptious bar, nutritionally giving, allergy-kind.
review/text: I have never been one to rely on nor crave a nutritional bar. Following a gluten-free and low-allergy controlled diet, I stumbled across these KIND bars while looking for nutritious options for my teens, thinking I would be able to try them. Well indeed they truly are scrumptuous. My 18 year old loves them and when running out the door will grab one or two for the road. I have only tried the Walnut and Date and the Cranbery, Almonds and Oxidants varieties as I follow a blood type diet and also do not love foods that are too sweet. We are on our second box of each and I will be looking at the other varieties to try in time.

review/text: We are on a special diet and there are very few bars that are healthy and have no ingredients that are bad for us.  This is one of them.  This is also incredibly delicious.  My husband, who has a lot of trouble chewing, says these bars are so good he doesn't mind the effort it takes to eat one!<br /><br />I've ordered these twice, but now that hubby has found out how good they are we might be ordering 2 boxes at a time in the future.<br /><br />If you want a quick pick-me-up snack that is healthy and tastes better than most candy, try these!

review/summary: Delicious, another awesome choice by Kind
review/text: I have the Fruit and Nut bars quite often, and wanted to try something new.  Read good reviews about these so decided to order some.  Yep, they're delicious.  It actually took me eating two before I REALLY loved them, but now I actually crave them.<br />As usual, I like that the ingredients are simple to read, and everything is identifiable.  No long chemical compounds in there.  I also like getting my daily serving of nuts really easily, and these totally give me a boost during my 3pm crash.

review/summary: Almond cashew + omega 3 Snack Bar
review/text: This is a nice snack.  It looks fairly healthy.  It's tasty and filling, especially with a cup of tea.  It is pretty chewy and loaded with nuts.  The almonds are on the hard side, in case you have trouble chewing.  The bar is mostly nuts with some cranberries and something that tastes like a date paste holding it all together.  It tastes a little on the sweet side but not too bad.  The wrapper claims 50 % each of vitamins B3, B6, B12 - 500 mg Omega 3, all natural, gluten free, wheat free, 4 g fiber, non GMO (sorry, don't know what that means), no trans fats, 150 calories per bar/80 from fat.  Total fat 9g, o sodium, o cholesterol, 190 mg potassium, 16 g carbs (I think--wrapper hard to read), 14g sugar, 4 g protein<br /><br />If you are looking for a decent snack for you or your children's lunch box, here ya go.

review/summary: Hard to believe it's good for you
review/text: I was looking for a replacement for my morning biscotti, something a bit more nutritious.  After searching on Amazon and reading reviews of breakfast snacks,<br />I decided to try these bars.  I'd had a KIND bar once and sort of remembered it was good. Well, these are FANTASTIC!  At first bite, I realized there were chunks of sweet mango, the intense mango flavor hit my palate, and it tasted real, not at all artificial.  This was followed by a bit of cruncy coconut which just perfectly tempered the sweet mango.  The macadamia's added a stronger crunch with just a hint of honey.  So I tried the ultimate test:  I gave one to my co-worker (out of the package, a blind test). This person lives on junk food and considers Krispy Kreme one of the four major health groups!  She absolutely loved this bar and sat down and ordered some on her break!!  The ones from Amazon were received in two days, expiration date was Dec 2010 (ordered April). They are fresh and the price was great with subscribe and save.  Love that I am getting some extra calcium and vitamin D (and no, you can't taste whatever they put in to add that).  I'll be ordering these regularly through subscribe and save. I just have to make sure I don't eat them for snacks, just for breakfast, or I'll run out =)

review/text: I LOVE Kind bars, but these are terrible.  Upon taking one bite they tasted stale and not like any other Kind bar product I purchase on a regular basis. I litterally had to spit it out after taking a bite...and that's extreme..sorry!!  Steer clear of these new bars, I really think something was wrong with them, again I couldn't return due to Amazon's policy.  Very disappointing.

review/text: These appear to be pretty healthy online and after the taste test and review of the ingredients I was pretty satisfied. They could hold off on some of the sugar/glucose, maybe unsweetened cranberries. Don't get me wrong, they are pretty tasty and mostly healthy but just a bit too sweet. A little tweaking and it could be the best "healthy" snack I've eaten.
