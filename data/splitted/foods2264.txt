review/summary: The only coffee that gets me going!
review/text: This coffee is the best and it's very tasty. It seems to be one of the few brands/flavors of coffee that I can drink and I actually feel the caffeine buzz, where the rest just add liquid to my body...<br /><br />This is a very dark roast but the taste is amazing. If you drink your coffee black like I do because you truly enjoy the flavor of coffee, this is the one for you.

review/summary: Great Probiotic
review/text: My daughter has been taking this probiotic for just over two months and I can already tell it is helping her.  She has some digestive issues and I think this will help her body heal itself.  Really like this product so far and would highly recommend it.  As with any probiotic it just takes time to work, it's not an instant fix but what is that really works.  Just give it time.  This would be great for reflux and other digestive issues.  Also this product is dairy free, which I have been looking for a long time.  My daughter is sensitive to dairy products and most infant probiotics have dairy in them.  So this is a huge plus and is made just for you baby's digestive system.

review/summary: Should Be Refrigerated
review/text: I've ordered this product from the company that manufactures it and they make you pay extra to ship it in a cool pack, because it should be kept refrigerated (which it says on the bottle). I'm an avid Amazon fan, so was thrilled to find it here. It came in a regular box, at room temperature. I returned it. Why spend that much to have it lose potency in shipping and very likely storage in the warehouse? Went back to ordering directly from Klaire Labs.

review/summary: Great for allergy sensity
review/text: I ordered this product to use for my 5 month old son. He had been on a round of antibiotics and I wanted to help "replenish" his digestive tract with all the probiotic goodness. He has a dairy sensitivity, so it took some time to find a probiotic that was dairy free...this one fit the bill. It has been great! He is a nursing infant so, I just wet my finger, dip it in the powder, and let him suck it off right before a nursing session 1-2 times a day, I could tell a difference with his bowel movements within a week or so. Would definitely recommend!

Once we added this to his diet - NO more constipation!  I'm so happy our Dr. introduced us to this product!  I tell all of my friends that this is a MUST have in your baby/toddlers diet.  I'm so grateful you can get this on Amazon and it's actually cheaper than what our Dr. sells it for.

review/summary: Solution to our toddler's ear infections
review/text: At the time, our 1 year old was getting ear infections on a monthly basis.  Every time we'd go into pediatrician and every time they'd recommend anti-biotics.  After 4-5th time of doing that we started to looking around for alternatives.  A pediatric chiropractor recommended these Klaire Lab probiotics for infants, so we gave them a try.  Almost a year later of daily using this product, our toddler has yet to get another ear infection.  We've been back to pediatrician for well visits and fluid has been observed in her ears, but it's not turning into ear infections like before.  I would highly recommend this product.  We just mix these probotics into milk for our toddler in the morning every day and it works like a charm.

review/summary: Helped my baby boy
review/text: My infant had thrush from 2 weeks until about 9 weeks, and the medicine given by the pediatrician was ineffective, not to mention messy and annoying to apply. I did some research and purchased this (although I purchased from their website and paid the huge cold-shipping charge to make sure the product was effective). It took about 7 days of daily use and I don't even really measure, I just sprinkle some in one of his bottles. Anyway, it cleared up his thrush and diaper rash and I continue to use it each day. Very pleased.

review/summary: Great deal for an effective probiotic!
review/text: At first glance this seems kind of expensive, but keep in mind there are 60 doses in each bottle. Also, after using it to fix a specific problem (thrush in my 7 month old) I know it is effective! My son had thrush a couple of times as an infant, and there was one persistent white spot on his gums that didn't go away for over a month. Within a few days of starting these probiotics, the spot disappeared.<br />I love the powder (instead of the granules we'd gotten from the pharmacy before). It's easy to mix with a little breast milk and just use your finger (or add more milk and use a syringe) to put it in baby's mouth. It has a mild sweet flavor that both of my babies liked.<br />One thing to keep in mind, I ordered a bottle direct from the company's website and it had over a year until the expiration date. When I needed another bottle, the website said they were out of stock so I came to Amazon. The bottle from Amazon only had about 6 months until the expiration date. And I got an email from the company within a day or so to let me know that they had more in stock (but it was after I had already ordered from Amazon).

review/text: My baby had had diaper rash for 2 months, despite everything we tried and everything we did. I was on antibiotics once during the pregnancy and once during and right after delivery. I'd been told that destroys the good bacteria in my system, and likely wiped my baby's out as well. Well, I tried this formula and within a couple days his diaper rash was completely better, and has been for over a week now. Amazing. We don't even use ANY diaper rash cream any more. I also heard that probiotics are good for baby's immune system, so I will be keeping him on this formula.

review/text: We started using this probiotic for our 4 month breastfed baby after trying several others after a round of yeast infection. This is the best! You get more for your money because each serving has 10 billion unlike other brands that have way less. Our baby sucks it off his daddys pinky every few days. It doesn't clump and baby takes it without difficulty. He seems to enjoy it. I tasted it and it has a faint pleasant taste without be sugarly, which is a problem with so many infant meds. It is wonderful.

review/text: Columbia Coffee Delight is a medium brown, oval shaped, hard candy with a good flavor. It certainly isn't overly sweet; personally I would probably add some brown sugar to the mix. No surprise, with coffee being only the #5 ingredient on a 9 item list, the coffee flavor is mild. It actually is another one of those candies that makes you think it has big coffee flavor until you A B compare it with one of the truly top coffee candies.  5 out of 10<br />  FYI- United, Kopiko and Coffee Rio were the top finishing coffee candies.<br />  God bless.

review/text: I ordered this because the reviews were all so positive.  I received the order promptly and when I tried the coffee, I was very disappointed.  Flavorless to the point of being worthless.  I made a couple of batches (I got the whole bean) and I and my friends all agreed it was worthless coffee.  BUT I called the Camano Island people directly and they were very nice and offered to send me a fresh batch.  The guy I spoke to (Dan) was very helpful and he gave me a very positive impression of the company.  My guess is that Amazon just sent me some stale coffee and the fault lies with them, not this company.  So the point of this review is, if you order this coffee and find it stall, try getting some directly from the company and perhaps you will be happier.

review/text: I've lived all over the country, had various local blends and roasts, tried ordering from specialty shops and supposed "best in world" expensive brands, and this is hands down the best medium-roast, full-flavored, entirely unacidic coffee we've ever had.  If Amazon ever quits carrying it I think we'll stop drinking coffee, nothing else compares.  I'd rate it higher if I could.<br /><br />The flavor is full-bodied with a decidedly medium roast but the linger of dark roast, just a hint of nuttiness, and unbelievably smooth.

review/text: The best way to review was to make a cup beforehand. I used about 1.5 - 2 TBS per cup, course grind with a blade grinder (I know tisk, tisk, but my burr grinder is at the office), and a french press using boiling water for 3:30 ... I think I could even shorten the time to 3:00, considering the blade grinder and boiling water and that might have worked too.<br /><br />The result was a well rounded and smooth cup of coffee. I like it and look forward to enjoying the entire batch. Considering what I did get from this roaster, I'd be inclined to check out some of their other blends.<br /><br />I gave it "4 stars" simply because it didn't knock my socks off, but it was certainly above average ("3 stars")

Each morning, I put one in the microwave for 30 seconds and have it for breakfast.  Delicious and portion controlled!

review/summary: Cinnamon Crumble Yum!
review/text: I never thought I'd find an organic, vegan, gluten free coffee cake that actually had flavor and personality, but this one has it all! This is the best coffee cake I have ever tasted, GF or not! It can get dry if made a according to the recipe on the bag. All I did was add a little bit of cinnamon applesauce. This increased the moisture. But this never lasts long at out house anyway. Even the 'normal' eaters love it and can't tell the difference. Since we have no nut allergies, I also add pecans on top for a little extra crunch and flavor. This beats any bakery coffee cake in town. This is a great thing to bring to family events, book clubs, bake sales, etc. The price on amazon is the lowest I have found anywhere. Highly recommend!

review/summary: Delicious, Easy, and Versatile
review/text: Not only is this is one of my favorite desserts, but it's one of the easiest  to make!  I love the basic coffeecake (which only lasts 1-3 days in my house of 2), but you can combine the cake in layers with fruit to make the cake suit the season.  We've had success just throwing frozen cherries in as well, but it's easy to slice up fresh apples and pears to put in.  When we're trying to figure out which Cravings Place mixes we're willing to order a whole box of to squeeze into our 450 square foot house, this is the one mix that's a no-brainer.  If you like coffeecake and you don't want all the stuff in normal cakes mixes in your body, you should really try this.  Unless you've had your taste buds removed, you won't be sorry.

Try this:  spread half the batter into an 8x8 glass baking dish, pour on one can of cherry pie filling, then the rest of the batter.  It will stay moist for days if you can stay away from it.

As a family we are so tired of things that taste nasty, mushy pasta , cookies that taste  like grit, so we were hoping that this would be as good. WE were not disappointed. They have been out of the oven for 10 minutes, and they are gone! These are really quite good, moist not grainy or beanie, they are really a hit. The people at 123 get it, in my opinion, for many of us this is our new life , and we want to eat things that really taste good.

I do find the brine taste a little strong for my liking, but a quick rinse in fresh water tones down the saltiness just enough. I also tried rinsing some and tossing them with olive oil and some herbs. I think I'm going to experiment with some different herbs to see what I like best because the oil and herbs definitely add to the enjoyment of these olives.<br /><br />Note that they come in a plastic tub, not in the metal can that is pictured in on Amazon. It is still the same quantity, just easier to open and close.

review/summary: DO NOT ORDER THESE UNTIL THEY PACKAGE THEM IN A CAN
review/text: It is not a good sign when you open your door and smell olive juice from a wet package three feet away.  The bucket was broken and ALL of the olive juice was drained away.  The plastic bucket was sealed with foil and a plastic lid.  Then the bucket was wrapped in 2 layers of very heavy plastic.  The bucket was broken, the lid was popped off, the foil was torn and the plastic bags were torn open.  The box was at least twice as wide and high than the bucket, but there was no padding like air bags - just 2 mats to absorb the liquid, which had soaked the mats and leaked through the box.<br /><br />Picholine are my favorite olive.  These are on the salty side.  I do not particularily like them.  I have transfered the olives to glass jars, made a brine and put them in the refrigerator.  Time will tell if they can even be used in cooking.

Mine arrived with the top completely off, the cardboard box soaked with brine and 3/4 of the olives in the moldy cardboard box. The entire mess was unusable. Amazon did their usual great job of customer service... we received an immediate refund, but the trashcan got the olives, not us. I'd give this sad mess zero stars if I could. Last sad little detail is the big 'Ready To Ship' label on the top of the container. It clearly wasn't.

review/summary: It's a hit!
review/text: My two cats (almost two years old) were raised on the Spot's Stew indoor formula salmon kibble (plus their canned food), and we've recently switched to this kibble due to possible grain allergies. They've just polished off their first 6lb bag of this, and it seems to be a hit! They took to the new flavor right away and chow down like nothing's changed. Just an FYI for humans, though: this variety seems to have a much more potent scent than the salmon flavor. (I can't speak to the scent of the others.) It's a normal, natural, chicken-y scent, just REALLY strong. Overall, though, it's a great product, and I'm really glad Halo came out with a grain-free variety so that I wouldn't have to switch my kitties to another (inferior!) brand of grain-free food. Thanks, Halo!

All 12 boxes were melted and the outside package was even greasy from the melted candy.  Not one piece escaped from melting.  I was so disappointed.  I can not believe it was mailed this way.  What a waste of my money.  I will not be ordering through you again unless you would want to make it good.  I will send the product back to you in the same shape I received it if you would like a box of melted mess.

review/summary: Dove Peanut Butter Promises are delicious
review/text: I bought these because I adore peanut butter and chocolate. I was a bit concerned at first because I have allergies, a lot of allergies. I am not allergic to peanut butter itself, but to a preservative often used in candy. I was so concerned about an allergic reaction, that I almost gave the bag of Peanut Butter Promises to my children without even trying them. However, I gave in and unwrapped the orange foil from the neat little square of peanut butter filled chocolate. The candy is creamy and just melts in your mouth. It is also absolutely delicious. The chocolate was so good that I had to take the bag across the room, and put it away, in order to save some for later. The plus side for me? Not a hive in sight! I am not saying that anyone with allergies will be able to eat these, as allergies are very specific to each individual. However, I am extremely happy to be able to eat peanut butter and chocolate again. I am also thrilled that the candy tastes so good. Dove Milk Chocolate & Peanut Butter Promises are absolutely wonderful and well worth every penny paid for them.

review/summary: Too many oranges!
review/text: I had been buying this candy from a machine (for a quarter at a time) and filling a ziplock bag to take home.  I tried to find it in the bricks and mortar stores, and they don't seem to have it or even know what I am talking about.  I even checked the bulk candy place in the mall (which seems to have gotten very expensive), yet even they didn't seem to know.<br /><br />Nitwitz works well as a "candy dish" candy because the pieces are solid (no candy dust) and don't seem to leave a residue in the dish (like a gummy candy might).  These are very similar to Willy Wonka Runts, but somewhat smaller and more tart.  The only issue with it is that it seems that the oranges make up an outsize percentage of the mix.  I suppose that it is possible that buying it from the machine somehow filtered out the larger orange pieces.  Also, the orange pieces are more like jawbreakers and I will have to warn guests about trying to bite down on them right away.  The other pieces are not quite as hard.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the 2.5 lbs. mix and it should last me for several months.  It arrived in an unlabeled, sealed plastic bag inside two padded envelopes.  There does not seem to be any broken pieces.

review/summary: The BEST for masa
review/text: I didn't realize that this was 'the' brand to use for making arepas, but it doesn't surprise me at all to find out. My friends and I used to use Maseca when we made arepas on the weekends, or the morning after a party at our house to fuel the clean-up effort and for whomever was still hanging around. After more than half a decade of doing this we stumbled upon PAN and realized just how much better it is at making a beautiful smooth almost creamy masa. The results are not even comparable. Luckily we can get it quite easily in any grocery store in or around DC, I'm sorry to here that you have a hard time finding it in CA-- that's surprising. So this review is really for comparison of brands. So as far as that's concerned, this is it. If you are thinking of ordering corn flour/corn meal on the internet for making tamales, arepas, tortillas, etc. this is the brand.<br /><br />And since I'm writing a review anyhow, I might as well share, this is how we make arepas:<br /><br />Mix PAN white corn meal with water and a bit of salt to make a masa (dough) which should be wet enough to easily form into thick smallish pancake like forms in your hands, but shouldn't come off in little globs sticking to your fingers. However you will get sticky hands eventually. Cook these on a medium heat using a cast iron skillet lightly greased with olive oil until the arepas are nicely browned on both sides, then transfer them to the oven to keep warm while you finish the rest. I like to make my arepas fairly thick, about 3/4" and 5-6" in diameter. Made that way not many people can eat more than 2, because then of course there are the fillings....<br /><br />Grate some fresh mozzarella cheese, put 2-3 cans of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005YL6TA">Goya Black Beans - 24 Pack</a> in a pot with chopped green onion and a little salt. Simmer on a medium low heat like that until they look and taste done. They should be served hot so if they finish before everything else is ready just re-heat them before serving.<br /><br />Guacamole and salsa are also a must, and you can have a little extra chopped cilantro on the table for people to add if they like.<br /><br />For the salsa, chop about one small red onion very finely. If you find raw red onion too sharp a taste you can soak it, once it's chopped, briefly in a bowl with salt water to draw out some of that intensity. Finely dice 3-4 large ripe tomatoes removing most of the watery bits. Mix with the red onion, juice of half a lime, add some chopped cilantro and salt and pepper to taste. Only add the salt just before serving as it will draw out the juices in the tomatoes. Or instead add half - 1 pack of Goya Saz&oacute;n <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SW1GSU">Goya Sazon Goya Clntro/achte, 1.41-Ounce Units (Pack of 36)</a>.<br /><br />For the guacamole, use 5 ripe avocados chopped and then continue to mash with your hands. I usually give this job to some poor helplessly polite and obliging guest, but trust me it tastes better that way. Not when a guest does it but when it's done by hand. You still get some nice chunks because hands just can't squeeze it all out before even the most obliging guest will ask to be excused, but it's still nice and smooth. Come on, don't be so fastidious! They'll wash their hands! Season with finely chopped cilantro, fresh lime juice (the importance can not be stressed enough of only ever using freshly squeezed lime juice, whether you're making a gin and tonic or guacamole-- no exceptions. And the same goes for lemon juice.), continue seasoning with salt and cumin powder. Add to all of this some finely diced tomatoes and even more finely chopped red onion as well as some completely pulverized jalepano and you'll have a killer guac.<br /><br />All of these things can be put out in bowls for guests to add to their arepas in whatever combination or ratios they prefer. But if you're taking beans and cheese I don't know why you would put them next to each other so that the warm delicious re-fried beans can slightly melt the cheese. Like I said before, you can also have a small bowl of chopped cilantro and or chopped green onion and or sour cream for people to add as well.<br /><br />&iexcl;Buen provecho!

review/text: Thanks to Amazon because I can get the Harina P.A.N. for my family and friends here in USA, on California's supermarkets is really hard to find this brand, sometime the Mexican or Latinos' Supermarkets has only few bags but not a continue supply of this corn meal.<br /><br />The shipping is really expensive and the final price is really high when you compare the price of the product in Venezuela and here in USA. More than 5 dollar x each Kilo (bag) vs. less than 25 cents in Venezuela, but is just to remember the good flavor. Thanks again.

review/text: I've been making homemade flour tortillas successfully for a long time, but the perfect corn tortilla has eluded me. No more. THIS is the masa I've been waiting for. Don't follow the recipe too rigidly though - I found the recipe on the bag left me with very wet dough, so I just kept adding more masa, kneading after each addition, until it got to the consistency I was expecting (it should not stick to your hands, but not crumble when pressed). Make the balls of dough and press between a couple of sheets of plastic (I've found two sides of a heavy duty Ziploc bag work best) and you'll get the perfect corn tortillas. No more eating the grainy store bought tortillas that cost me a fortune in Japan. And although they freeze OK, they are much better freshly made.

review/text: Ordered this mix (Harvest Vegetable) on a whim, and I'm very happy with it.  The recipe advises two tablespoons of mix with a cup of sour cream and a cup of mayo, but that was far too much dip and the flavor didn't come through quite as much as I'd have liked.  Next time, I'll do two tablespoons with a half cup of each.  That said, it goes very well with vegetables (carrots and celery specifically) and crackers, probably not the best with chips given how thick the dip is.  Excellent product, will try more varieties in the future.

review/text: I have tried some pu erh tea that I enjoyed for the unique taste, however this matcha is either bad quality or I would just not recommend this item. I have had red tea matcha and green tea matcha and this does not even come close in taste or the texture whisked in. I would reccomend not getting this type of matcha at all, that's not to say I don't like this tea, I love it, that's why I ordered the medium size one. If I had to rate this tea from one to ten, this would be in the three to four range.<br /><br />I was a little skeptical forking out so much money for this type of tea since I was well aware of the quality it could be and as well as 'fake' or lower grades being sold for good quality matcha. I downright would prefer the lose leaf tea over this.

That's a big jump!<br />Sorry, went to another amazon/prime seller and purchased it from them.<br /><br />Oh my gosh!  This is the most delicious chocolate!  Godiva has always been my favorite but these  have replaced the Godiva chocolate for me due to huge price difference. The price is so great on these.  I bought them at  11.37 for 4 bags and that is a deal!  I compared them to the Dove bars which are the same taste but these are a much better buy.  I purchased  both the milk  chocolate almond and the caramel and it's  a toss-up which we like the best. Of course the almond does have the benefit of almonds being good for you! They are the perfect size to pop in your mouth. I never chew them ...just let them melt. The biggest problem I have now is limiting myself. I had ordered hershey's recently and they were good but 'don't hold a candle' to these. So many chocolates I have tasted are too "waxy". These are not, they are so smooth, just as they say. wThese are very addictive! If you haven't aleady, please try these.  They arrived very fresh with expiration date a year away.  are soooo yummy!

I keep a tin in my bag at all times just so when the proffs voice starts to sound a little to Charlie Brown's teacherish "wha whoa ah wha" Oh no time to eat four or five of these and now I hear "The battle took place in..."  Jones Energy also comes in handy when you are on a long drive, they don't make you have to stop and pee every 65 miles.  Now if my wife would just realize it.
