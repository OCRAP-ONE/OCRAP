review/summary: These chips are great!
review/text: I'm getting ready to order my second case of this chips, sea salt flavor.  I bought my first bag at a hospital cafeteria and I was hooked.  My son, who is maintaining a 60 pound weight loss, has a 1.1 oz bag with his lunch everyday and I always pack one in my lunch bag too.  Tasty, satisfying and low-calorie.  What more could you ask for?

review/summary: PopCorners are poppin' with flavor
review/text: I saw these chips and had to buy them since I purchase Popchips by the case on a regular basis. I assumed these were the same except made with corn. I was right. They are delicious! I enjoy plain corn chips or plain multigrain chips and these too are plain and simple with lots of flavor. I don't think these need all the elaborate flavoring (i.e. Nacho cheese, spicy salsa, triple cheese, etc.). They are great for my kids lunch and a nice indulgence for me if I eat a sandwich for lunch. I highly recommend these.

review/summary: You win some, you lose some
review/text: I live in the middle of nowhere so if I want to try new food products I've read about, I often have to come to amazon.com to find them.  I've only had a few products arrive that I felt were duds. I recently read a raving review by Hungry Girl about this product , and decided to give it a shot.  Wow, not good.  It may be made from corn, but it tasted more like a rice cake to me, and not a very good one at that.  Plus, the cracker itself has this wrinkly brain appearance...it's kind of creepy.  Not wanting to be the only judge, I gave some to my husband to try.  He loves snack foods and will eat just about anything.  He tasted a couple and said "you don't need to bother with these again".  We threw the rest of the box away.  They aren't worth the calories.

review/summary: Kashi Go Lean Crunchy Chocolate Pretzel
review/text: This wasn't too bad of a bar.  There is something about the mix of pretzels and chocolate that I really really like, so when I saw this flavor, I was pretty excited.<br /><br />I definitely could taste the chocolate in this bar.  It was a smooth milk chocolate and really the most predominate taste in the bar.  next would be the crunchy granola like ingredients.  Strangely I couldn't really taste the pretzels all too much, but I could visually see them in the bar.  So I know they were there.  the bar wasn't too sweet, but just enough so that it felt like a breakfast bar and would have gone well with a glass of milk.  The crunchiness was ok, although I did notice that the bar could be a little sharp in places, poking into the gums and probably wouldn't be a good treat to give a child as a result.<br /><br />Not that this bar should be a treat. It has 160 calories in it, which is less than most bars but still pretty high for a snack.  This should be used as a fitness snack or maybe in place of a meal.  It also has 8 grams of protein and quite a bit of fiber.  Although the sodium level is a little high as well.  It does add in some vitamins, which helps a bit.<br /><br />Ingredients are plentiful, and there are some in there I can't really  pronounce, although I suspect a lot of that is the added vitamins.  Brown Rice Syrup is the sweetener, and the first ingredient on the list.  It also has fructose, evaporated cane juice crystals, and the chocolate.  And of course there's that Kashi blend of grains they like to advertise as well.  Not a bad list of ingredients, but I've seen better out of other brands of bars.<br /><br />I'd probably eat this bar again.  I do like the concept of pretzels and chocolates, and it was a good tasting bar.  It even has the lesser calories, which is always a plus.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/text: I really love this stuff.  So perfect. Crisp. Flavorful.  Not too heavy or syrupy like some of these type drinks, but more taste than flavored water.  I like mine chilled but not really really cold.  If you had a wine fridge that would be perfect.  I can drink them at room temperature and they're still okay.  It's the perfect balance for a drink. They used to sell it in Montgomery, Alabama but now I cannot find it in any of the stores here.  The closest I have found it is at Publix in Atlanta.  If anyone knows where they sell this stuff in Alabama please let me know. Thanks.

review/text: WILD-CAUGHT fish are free of any diseases that may pop up, even in the huge, (but not as huge as the ocean!) tanks used for farm-raised fish.  Salmon is supposed to be heart-healthy, and has far less, (if any), of the mercury found in albacore tuna.  And....salmon tastes yummy....especially sockeye salmon, (that is in these cans) -- which is reputed to be THE best-tasting salmon of all!<br /><br />REDHEAD salmon, made by the PURE ALASKAN SALMON COMPANY, herein being reviewed, is very, very, Very, VERY tasty!  The ingredients are simply "Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon and Salt".  This is not the (much!) more expensive fileted canned salmon -- but the skin and bone content is kept to a minimum.  (Skin and bones -- which are in themselves very healthy eating -- can easily become almost unrecognizable, upon simply combining the salmon with other ingredients and mixing.)  Sodium content here is medium -- 270 miligrams per can.  The sodium helps to keep the salmon fresh, (a natural preservative, if you will), but it can easily be washed away by taking the open can, and pressing the just-removed top in, whilst you run cold water over it....<br /><br />Sockeye salmon is RED salmon, (hence the name, REDHEAD).  Red salmon is slightly more fatty -- but much more tasty, (at least to me), than the pink variety of salmon.  (The extra fat gives the redder colour).<br />THIS brand of sockeye salmon, (REDHEAD) is amongst the tastiest sockeye salmon I have ever eaten!<br /><br />This salmon comes in a nice, golden coloured can, with NO SEAMS!  Seams in cans containing any food have been known to leach toxic materials into that food -- but there is no worry of that here.  I bought my REDHEAD salmon on 9th September, 2009 -- and the expiration date reads July, 2012 -- so this salmon will stay fresh for a LONG time!  It also bears the "OU" symbol of the Orthodox Union -- meaning that this product meets the highest in kosher quality.<br /><br />As attested to by the enclosures, (company priorities for safe, organic products, and serious stewardship of the atmosphere and planet -- plus some yummy recipes), the PURE ALASKA SALMON CO., which makes REDHEAD and other salmon, is totally committed to not only fine products -- but to the survival of their customers, (and all other human beings!), who inhabit this planet!<br /><br />This is salmon caught in ALASKA.  It is made by the Pure Alaskan Salmon Company, of Burlingham, WAshington, 98225.  It is therefore a TOTALLY AMERICAN-MADE PRODUCT!  For those who care about such things, (like me!), this is VERY important -- and can even make the salmon tastier! : )<br /><br />All in all -- and for so many, many reasons -- a very good choice to make when preparing salmon dishes!  Highly recommended!

This company also cans a very good pink salmon (some of the best I've tasted): Think Pink Wild Pink Salmon. Put a little variety in your salmon dining: try them both. Delicious and healthy, five times the omega-3's as chunk light tuna, twice that of albacore and no to negligible mercury.

review/text: I've tried salmon before.  Whether it was fresh or canned.  This one though... all's I can say is Wow!  and Yum lol.  I wasn't expecting it to taste so great!  First time I tried this particular one.  I mixed it with frozen veggies, (corn, peas, carrots, and green beans).  I tossed it in the microwave, simple as that.  Squeezed some lime into it, mixed it and when I took a bite out that.  Man it tasted like it had been cooking for hours!  The flavor is just there and with all the great benefits it gives you, why wouldn't you want to eat it?  I'm definitely buying more when I start to see that I'm low on salmon.  This one's a keeper :D

review/summary: Real Sockeye Salmon
review/text: Yes, most of us, by now, realize that fisherman have almost destroyed the salmon industry by over-fishing.  It is the cold northern Alaskan waters that produce the most desired salmon and it is being depleted to a danger point.  I purchased a case of this Redhead Wild Sockeye and have used it in many ways and my family especially asks for the salmon cakes that are super-good.  I got the recipe from an on-line cooking site. Or you can use a recipe for crab cakes and substitute the sockeye.<br />This is meat from happy salmon, the ones who spawn and live a clean, yet wild, life! I investigated salmon farms because I wondered "Who ever heard of such a thing!"  Salmon can't live properly in a farm.  Salmon farms are not conducive to a healthy product. So, in the meantime, during the time it takes to once again replenish the schools of salmon, you will be seeing the farm-raised fish in your supermarket.

I ordered this product a while back as a collectible and was highly pleased with what I got. However I was a bit dissatisfied that it was so hard to find, and I really wanted to try it. I eventually lucked out after finding a ton of it at a local store and decided to purchase two more to store as collectibles and another to taste. As for the flavor it had a very pleasant and slightly tart but still sweet berry flavor, and of course being true to the series it had it's signature blue color. I would definitely recommend this to any Trek fan and also just anyone who'd like try something new and unique to drink for once. This is an excellent product and I wish it could be made much more available than it is right now! :)

review/summary: Success!
review/text: I have a picky eater at home.  Missy hates dog food she feels we should pull up a chair at the table for her.  However, people food is not what she needs.  After trying several foods BLUE BUFFALO was a winner.  I set it down and she eats right away.  I thought it was to easy and the next meal would be a problem, however, I was surprised to find she went right to work on eating.  I like the fact the food is healthy for her and she likes it a home run for BLUE BUFFALO!

review/text: Was shocked when i got this canned food and found half of the 12 cans heavily dented. I dont know about everyone else but i personally wont eat dented food from the grocery store so i certainly wont feed dented canned dog food to my dog. I contacted amazon.com about this and they said they were going to investiate. They were supposed to take the item offline and say it is under review but i see they are still offering it. So much for their supposed investigation as to why they send out dented cans of dog food.

review/summary: Authentic Mexican Restaurant Taste
review/text: Just as with the Original Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan Hot Sauce, this salsa has a unique, addictive flavour.  We've been a salsa family for two decades but have never tasted any salsa at home which has the rounded, authentic flavour that this salsa has.  Is it the cactus?  (An ingredient that we never see here in Canada)  or the tequila?  or a combination with cilantro and spices?  I don't even want to know.  I just want to know that these products will always be available.<br /><br />If you are trying to decide if you should give this salsa a whirl...don't hesitate.  It's simply the best salsa we've ever tasted.  I'm sure you'll agree.

review/summary: not quite tricky enough and high mess potential
review/text: I got this toy because I wanted my cat to work a little for his food.  This toy was not the cat-torturing puzzle I was hoping for.  Unfortunately, my cat figured out how to get the food out efficiently in under 3 minutes.  It's not terribly tricky as the toy is essentially a hollow plastic ball with a hole in one side.  Food comes out almost every time my cat taps the ball.  It comes out so easily, more comes out than he sometimes wants to eat in one sitting.  I often find little trails of kibble all over the living room.  Still, I guess having to tap the ball a few times to get his food is more work than just eating it out of a bowl.  Also, you can pry the ball open so that you can clean it, which is a plus.

review/summary: Lots of fun
review/text: I agree that this isn't terribly tricky and that cats can get the treats out relatively quickly, but they still love it and get very excited when they see me filling up their "treat balls."  Because of the ease of getting the food out I usually fill these up with their regular kibble and let them use it to get some or all of their morning meal-definitely more fun and more active than the usual hovering over the bowl.<br /><br />Instead of giving each of my cats their own treat ball, I've started to put one treat ball out at a time-it makes it more challenging and fun for them to have to chase and battle for access to the treat ball (assuming your cats get along as well as ours do.)  They make it like a game of soccer, and its very funny to see them trying to steal the ball from each other and to block the ball from being stolen while they chomp down the food that they have earned.  One of my cats even has figured out how to "guard" the ball by sitting on it while he is busy eating the treat that fell out.  Another has perfected the "swat".

Cat seems to enjoy the activity.<br /><br />With smaller round-shaped cat food (Wellness), the food comes out too easily.

The balls came in a package of 2 and upon trying to open one of the balls to put the treats in, the plastic broke. So, I filled the 2nd one and it took her about 5 minutes to get all the treats out.  I think she enjoyed it though, so will continue to use it. Any little challenge is better than none for this smart kitty. Why do they make cat toys out of such cheezy materials?

As for me, I think it's a simple decent product that does what it's supposed to.  The opening is relatively large, but I use it with a larger kibble like Max Cat ([...]) , or if using it with smaller kibble I use masking tape to make the opening smaller.  There's a similar product on the market with a variable-sized opening thhat i haven't yet tried, but this one works fine as long as it's with larger-sized kibble.  Easy to open and clean.

Unfortunately, my 4 year old lazy kitties don't seem as interested as I would hope - they like to eat the treats that fall out when I shake it, but they won't chase the ball themselves. Are they too dumb to figure it out? Too lazy to exert the effort? I can't tell you. I think these are a great idea, and I will definitely keep them around in case we have another younger kitty come into the household - I have a hunch that a younger kitten would go after these like crazy!

review/text: I love Matcha and I love licorice, so this flavored Matcha should be a no-brainer, right?  But to be honest, not all licorice flavors are done right, and it's one of those flavors that if it's not right, it can be just WRONG.<br /><br />Fortunately, Red Leaf Tea did licorice RIGHT!  This is a strong, crisp, zesty licorice flavor.  It's really an exhilarating flavor.  As I sip it, the aftertaste reminds me very much of Altoid's Liquorice which is the strongest licorice flavored thing I've ever tasted.  This nearly rivals the Altoids in strength ... but this is even better because of the Matcha.  The Matcha offers its creamy consistency and slightly buttery, sweet vegetative tones to the sip, which softens the sharper notes of the licorice in a very appealing way, creating a flavor that reminds me of black Jelly Bellys ... as if someone took black Jelly Bellys and liquified them and stirred them into a bowl of Matcha.<br /><br />It is so good.  If you like black licorice, you should try this.  If you are a black licorice fiend like I am - you've GOT to try this ... this may just be my new favorite source of black licorice flavor, not to mention my new favorite flavored Matcha!

review/summary: Licorice? I barely know orice!
review/text: I have such a love/hate relationship with licorice, and I had to try this one, I just had to. Licorice in tea is one of my favorite things of all time, and the Licorice Mint tea from Red Leaf Tea is a must for me when I'm sick. And while I love allsorts, any other licorice candy is not for me. I just think it's vile. Every Easter my mother would gleefully sit by as I sorted out all of the black jelly beans from my basket. She was the only one in the family who liked them. Is there anything more gross than popping what you think is a purple jellybean into your mouth, only to discover it was a horrible, horrible, licorice one? Blegh! But allsorts....mmm. They've become a bit of tradition in our family. They're impossible to find in Tennessee, so when I'm sending a package to my folks I always include Coffee Crisp for my mom and allsorts for my dad. That is, if I can keep myself from eating them all before the package goes out! Trust me, it happens more often than I care to admit.<br /><br />I kept eyeing this tea, adding it to my shopping cart and then removing it in favor of another flavor of matcha, adding it back to my wishlist. I finally bit the bullet and I'm here to find out if this is an allsort or a black jellybean.<br /><br />It's not a black jellybean at all! It is a lovely sweet licorice that soothes the throat and makes me unbelievably happy. I was very scared of this blend, but those fears were unfounded. It is delicious and definitely one I need to keep around for when I'm sick but I have to deal with work anyway. Completely lovely. It's not really an allsort either, it's the licorice I've come to know and love in teas. I should have expected that, but I was scared by the picture on the website.<br /><br />Licorice tends to polarize people. You either love it or you hate it. I'm one of those who loves it, but my wife is one who hates it. If it's in a tea, she can taste it, and it bothers her. But for me...oh, I love it and this matcha is beautiful in the balance of flavor to matcha. I want to make a large mug of this, but I have other matchas to taste and review!

review/summary: Tuscan Oil at Its Finest, but....
review/text: Badia a Coltibuono olive oil is a legend, deservedly so. But be forewarned -- if you are used to the bland olive oils sold mass market in most supermarkets, the strong assertive character may come as somewhat of a shock. As noted in the Amazon product description, "according to Deborah Krasner in "The Flavors of Olive Oil", this oil "...is strongly and pleasantly bitter, with a pronounced burn....'It made my face scrunch up.' Very green and grassy, this is an oil made for drizzling."" I would tend to agree with that. In my opinion, this is really at it's best drizzled over grilled meats, vegetables and salads almost as a condiment. For dipping bread and most cooking (it's too expensive for most chefs on a budget like mine anyway) you might prefer an oil from Sicily, Spain, Australia or California, which are softer and more buttery. That said, for purists, this may be the right olive oil even for bread dipping. It's flavors and aromas are remarkably complex and powerful.

My favorite is the Half and Half, a mixture of tea and lemonade.

review/summary: Horrible! Nestl&eacute; is better by far!
review/text: First I want to say I love most all Hershey's candy bars. That's why I was so surprised when I made my famous home made chocolate chip cookies with this brand (instead of what I normally use, Nestl&eacute;) and they tasted so bad I had to throw out the entire batch. Nothing more to say, they were that bad and I was hugely dissapointed.<br /><br />For full disclosure I did not buy these at Amazon so to prove I did buy and try them I include a photo above. You'll see I also tried the milk chocolate chips. They were horrible too.

review/summary: Got expired crackers.
review/text: Previously, I ordered these crackers from the original Dr. Kracker company. I was completely satisfied until Amazon took over. After that, Amazon changed the bundle so that one must buy 6 boxes at a time, which is way too much. Also, the last shipment of crackers I received were expired. I only noticed that after I had gone through half of them wondering why they were stale. Make sure yours are not expired before you eat them. The crackers are tasty. I prefer the pumpkin cheese, but the overall experience has been meteocre.

review/summary: Amazon keeps on sending me the wrong item
review/text: Be cautioned when ordering this product.<br /><br />What happened was I ordered this product a month ago, and was sent the flatbread version instead of the clear tub of bite-size version.  I called Amazon, explained my problem, they promised to fix it by sending me a replacement.<br /><br />Well, the replacement came last week, and it was still the flatbread.  I'm not going to bother to call Amazon again because I know it will just result in them sending me the flatbread once again.<br /><br />The flatbread itself was tasty and crunchy.  I think the seeds really helped to put more complexity into the flavor.  You can eat just the flatbread as snacks or maybe put a bit peanut butter or jam on top.  It tastes very different than wheat, and I like the taste of spelt quite a bit.<br /><br />So please be prepared to receive the flatbread version when you order.  You may as well just order the flatbread version to start with and save yourself couple of bucks as well as having to call Amazon to straighten things out.

review/summary: Exactly what I wanted.
review/text: I have been trying to drink more tea with stevia in it in order to cut down on diet sodas with other sweeteners in them. After hearing the advantages of cinnamon as a appetite suppressant and how it controls the blood sugar, I have also been adding more cinnamon to my diet. I came across cinnamon tea researching other types of tea and thought it was a perfect answer. I was right. I have been drinking some in the afternoon when my appetite starts to run amok, and it brings it right back under control for me.<br /><br />Please note that the Harney & Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice tea contains orange peels and cloves. The Bigelow Cinnamon Stick tea contains only black tea and cinnamon which is exactly what I wanted. I hate the taste of cloves, and don't think it is fair to compare the two teas like a previous reviewer did. This tea is delicious.

I put a tea bag in the hot coffee and have no need to add sugar or cream to make the drink palatable.

review/summary: Best breastfeeding supplement for moms!
review/text: The lactation consultants & midwife at the hospital recommended this tea after the birth of my second child. Breastfeeding was really tough with my firstborn, despite trying multiple supplements & even a prescription medication from by OB, I had to eventually supplement with formula. But this Milkmaid Tea made breastfeeding the second time around so much easier and the whole experiences much more wonderful for my baby and me. I also tried Fenugreek pills again, but when I ran out, I noticed no difference in my milk supply. However, the few times I have run out of this tea, I have noted significant decrease in milk supply and a resultant very fussy & upset baby. My baby is now 5 and a half months old and exclusively breastfed (no formula  or solids yet). He is growing wonderfully at 80th percentile for weight & height. I tribute a large part of this success to this amazing tea. It really works! Note: I have only been using the loose tea which came in the jar. Earth Mama Angel Baby changed their packaging recently to tea bags, but the formulation is supposed to be the same.

This quantity is enough to do a couple of 750ml bottles for yourself or to re-bottle and give as gifts around Christmastime. It only takes a few minutes to prepare and the difference in homemade vanilla is incredible. You can even make the bakers' favorite - double strength vanilla extract.

review/text: After reading the other reviews on this product, I was expecting beans that were moister and more flexible than the ones that I received.  But, I must say, the vanilla aroma was strong and the total quantity was high enough for me to try to make a quart of extract.  These beans seemed dry and brittle and were stiff compared to the free beans that I recieved along with my order.  I'll have to update my review in a couple of months once the extract sits around and becomes extract.  We shall see...

review/text: Robby's is a great brand, and not even comparable to any of the grocery store mixes.  I'm a scratch baker and this is as close as you can get to really great homemade buttermilk pancakes.  Robby's is sold in the upscale homestores like Williams Sonoma, but this price makes Amazon the place to buy it.  Smaller packages in the six pack are super convenient especially for camping and those trips to the cabin!

review/summary: BEST EVER!
review/text: My family was so fortunate to have been able to enjoy Robby's Pancakes in Treasure Island, Florida for decades.  It was a sad, sad day when they closed.  Fortunately, I bought two cases of Robby's Pancake Mix during our last visit and we are SO glad that it is still available online.  Last weekend we even found a local restaurant that serves Robby's pancakes made with Marburger Farm Full Fat Buttermilk.  Yum!  I've tried various milks, but real buttermilk is the ONLY way to go!  There is no other pancake mix, packaged or homemade, that has a flavor and texture as good as Robby's!
