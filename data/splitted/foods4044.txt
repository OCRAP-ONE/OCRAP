review/summary: Best Seasoning
review/text: I love this white cheddar seasoning.  I used to get it at my local grocery store and then they stopped carrying it so I had to order online. I use it for popcorn but also when sataying spinach and it makes spinach taste creamy and yummy without a bunch of extra fat.

review/summary: Its Ok
review/text: O thought this was going to be like the flavors you find in the  Imax theaters. This is quite not like it at all. It is  salty and you do have to put alot of it on to taste the cheddar. Overall if you are using it just for a seasoning salt its ok to add to veggies to give it a kick as well as potatoes. but overall to turn any thing into a real cheddar flavor this will not work.  3 stars because it does ok on veggies

review/summary: Good stuff, I make some great combo flavors
review/text: Yes this is a bit salty, but most popcorn seasonings I tried are.  This one is the easiest to get because of Amazon.  Like another reviewer mentioned, it is more powdery than grainy which is a good thing.  This doesn't necessarily stick perfectly, but that's okay.  I use any bag of buttered microwave popcorn and put this on while it is still hot out of the bag.  I think it may Stick a little better when it's warm.  No matter though, I wind up eating it off the bottom of the bowl as I eat the popcorn anyway.<br /><br />One of my favorite combos on the popcorn is using this white cheddar and sprinkling it on with curry powder, yum.  You can combine it with just about any other fine spice powder or herb to make all kinds of gourmet style flavors.<br /><br />I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because it could be a little less salty.  But when I eat popcorn it for a flavor explosion and salt helps to create that.

review/summary: Popcorn Delicious!
review/text: Just thinking about this seasoning makes me want to make popcorn. The white cheddar is great. But then all of these Kernel Season's are great. I make plain popcorn and then enjoy sprinkling on different Kernel Season's per bowl of popcorn and even using 2 or 3 different ones on the same bowl of popcorn. Just start out sprinkling light and add to your personal taste.

review/summary: Best of the Kernel Seasons salty/savory flavors
review/text: As the title says, this is the best of the Kernel Seasons savory/salty flavors. It complements the popcorn without overpowering it like the nacho cheddar flavor. It has a really nice cheese taste and it's powdery rather than grainy. It doesn't taste like I'm just pouring flavored salt on my popcorn. This is the flavor I originally tried at the movie theater that got me hooked on Kernel Seasons. Definitely pick this one up among your 5 or so flavors.

review/text: This stuff is the PITTS!!  It had very little flavor and as another reviewer said it takes 1/2 a bottle to flavor the corn if you are using a hot air popper, even with their suggested heavy PAM dose....I threw the other half of the container in the trash.<br />I tried Kraft Mac and Cheese with no luck, it just rolled off the popped corn, due to that being not a fine enough powder.<br />It would be nice to find a very fine powder that adheres to the popped kernels like the Popcorn Factory.  My search continues.....maybe Barry Farms Cheddar Cheese powder?.....we'll see......

review/summary: Salty!!!!
review/text: I have purchased both the seasoning jar and Kernel Seasons White Cheddar Popcorn already popped in a bag both from Costco.  Both are extremely salty!  The popcorn in a bag has the right cheese flavor but with that comes like half a days intake of salt per serving and you can taste it immensely.  Also when you shake the cheddar seasoning jar onto your own popcorn, to get a good cheese flavor, you have to use quite a bit which adds the taste of quite a bit of salt.  I don't understand why so much salt is necessary.  Furthermore, if you air pop your popcorn and then use the seasoning, the seasoning will not stick to your popcorn.  The popcorn needs to be popped in butter, margarine or oil.  After it is done, while it is still hot and greasy, you have to shake the seasoning on to get it to stick to the popcorn.  My favorite easy to find brand, which is not nearly as salty, is O-kee-dokee popcorn which you can find in chip isle at most grocery stores.  I have tried every brand of white cheddar popcorn out there I can find because I love it so much.  By far, this brand is the king of salt.  Another good easy to find brand which is not as salty as Kernel Seasons is the Quaker brand white cheddar popcorn cakes.  Cape Cod White cheddar popcorn is good as well but is also salty, although not as nearly as salty as Kernel Seasons. Kernel Seasons either needs to reduce the sodium content of their products, or create low sodium alternatives as well, in order to appeal to a bigger market group.

review/summary: Cheese is buried under a mountain of salt
review/text: I've ordered white cheddar cheese powder (I understand, now even more than before, that this is seasoning, not just cheese powder) several times for use on popcorn, and it's even a bit salty for my taste, but I like it. I wish I'd looked at the ingredients on this seasoning, because had I known it had three times the sodium content of the powder powder I normally get, I never would have ordered it. But it was a bit less expensive, so I thought I'd try it. By the time I put enough of it on popcorn to really taste cheese, it's so salty I can't eat the popcorn. Amazon immediately refunded my money when I brought this to their attention.<br /><br />So I guess I'll stick with my usual favorite.

review/summary: Wonderful popcorn topper without adding much calories
review/text: I love white cheddar and was looking for something like what they used to have at a nearby movie theater.  Couldn't find any of that, but since the theater no longer has the toppings out, I'm sure it was an MSG issue.  No issue here, this tastes good, but I would agree that you have to shake a lot on to get a the flavor on most of the popcorn.  I find it best to shake a little, eat a layer, rinse and repeat.  This definitely tastes great and am glad I tried it.

review/summary: GREAT Taste but Discard after using about 70% or it's too Salty!
review/text: This is a GREAT! seasoning but since the salt mix is so heavy you'll have toss it after using about 70% of it - Also when you first open a container you should dump it out then pour it back in to properly mix the seasoning (the salt seems to settle so I always keep a empty one and simply dump the newly opened one into the empty container). In any event after you use about 70% the salty taste will overpower the cheddar mix and become distasteful. Its obvious that the cheddar taste is MIXED with salt and its not a container of 100% cheddar flavor. In spite of this it tastes so good that I'm willing to spend a couple minutes making sure the flavor is properly mixed. Its 100% worth it!!

review/summary: Cheddar popcorn seasoning
review/text: I am a popcorn lover...lots of butter and just about any time of the day or night.  I have tried several different brands of popcorn seasoning in a number of different flavors.  The white cheddar seems to be the most consistently satisfying of all.  Kernal Seasonings offers their white cheddar topping, comparable to the very best others have, at about 1/3 the price.<br /><br />The flavor of the topping adds a subtle sweet taste but with a definite shart cheddar zing.  You will add what you think is enough to flavor a batch, but often find yourself adding more as you eat, simply because the taste and experience is so satisfying.

review/summary: BEWARE! Contains MSG.
review/text: The bottle says "No MSG" but this is actually false advertising.<br />1. In the US, companies are only required to list MSG on the ingredient label as MSG if it is a pure form of free glutamate.<br />2. It is true that this product does not contain pure MSG.<br />3. Many of the ingredients listed contain VERY high levels of MSG (free glutamate), and are included BECAUSE they contain MSG.<br />4. Both Disodium Inosinate and Disodium Guanylate are also included, which are pretty expensive to add, and are only added because they enhance the effects of MSG--they do nothing else. If Kernel Seasons really did not include MSG, there would be no point in adding these other additives (and it would be much cheaper not to add them).<br /><br />Some people choose to eat foods with MSG, and that's ok.  White Cheddar used to be my favorite Kernel Season's flavor before I learned how to read ingredient labels carefully.  If MSG doesn't bother you, go ahead and buy this if you want.  My husband is severely allergic to MSG, though, and when we were first learning to avoid MSG, labels like this caused him to be very sick.  Why not just remove "No MSG" from the package instead of misleading people?  This is really an unethical practice.<br /><br />I felt very disappointed and mislead when I discovered this.  Don't just take my word for it; go learn about the ingredients on the list.

review/summary: REAL pretzels, finally!
review/text: After searching and finding many gross gluten free pretzels, subpar gluten free pretzels, and even ones that "will do" because I have to have GF, I've been frustrated and almost didn't buy these.  But, I did...and they're amazing!  I'm pretty sure these are made with magic and unicorns, because they're the only real gluten free pretzels out there.  My non-gluten free S.O. likes these more than his regular pretzels, too.<br /><br />My other concern was about cross-contamination, because come on--this is Snyder's we're talking about, and their factories and warehouses must be a nightmare full of gluten.  But, much to my surprise, these have been certified gluten free by the Gluten Free Certification Organization, run by the Gluten Intolerance Group.<br /><br />These are so worth every single penny you'll pay for them.  I always have at least 3 bags in my cupboards at all times, and I carry a bag with me whenever I travel anywhere.

review/summary: i'm spoiled now
review/text: Hard to go back to standard salt after discovering the wonder that is fleur de sel. It makes everything taste better. The 35 oz container is a great deal. I bought wooden salt boxes and filled with the salt for a great Christmas gift which was appreciated by all. I filled 3 boxes plus my own which made it economical too.

review/summary: Best Finishing Salt
review/text: I already knew about this salt and had been using it.  It's a great "finishing" salt.  Sprinkle it on certain dishes just before serving.  It lends a little bit of "bite of salt" If you like the Godiva chocolate bar with sea salt, you'll understand what I mean. Great on tomatoes caprese, vegetables, crudites, salads - anything you want a little taste (bite) of salt.  It's flakey (kind of like Maldon) so doesn't dissolve as quickly, thus, the little "bite"  Expensive enough that you reserve it strictly for finishing.  I eat raw radishes sprinkled with it while I'm preparing dinner.  This large size is very definitely the best buy.  The small 4 oz size sells for around $9 or $10 locally.  If you love to cook, this is a wonderful salt.

review/text: This is a good product if you do not want to pay for the top of the line fleur du sel. The texture is more like salt chips than crystals, which leads me to think that there has been some processing to get the uniformity of color and size this product presents.

review/summary: A pretty good step workout - nothing too intense
review/text: It's a pretty good effort, considering it's one of Tracey's first workouts.  Greg Twombly produced it and Tracey should have stayed with him since her subsequent workouts have not as good production quality.<br /><br />This workout consists of 9 Step Routines.  Each routine is followed by a 2 minute intensity blast.  Tracey teaches TIFT(take it from the top), meaning that you repeat each routine after you've learned the next routine.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about this workout:<br /><br />*Tracey's style.  As a long-time Cathe fan, it's nice to have a different personality and style to follow.<br />*The short step routines. They're a bit complex, especially routine 2 with the baby mambo, but they're over quickly.<br />*The intensity blasts are tough!  They sneak up on you.<br /><br />What I didn't care for in this workout:<br /><br />*Tracey's voice is very loud and she appears to be yelling the instructions.  Maybe this is her natural teaching style, but it gets annoying.<br />*The step routines aren't that intense.  I made them more intense by using 2 risers on each side of my step. Tracey and her crew are only using 1 riser on each side.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty good intermediate step workout, especially if you like somewhat complex choreography without a lot of breakdown.

review/summary: Cugino's IS a Knockout!!
review/text: I decided to take a chance on these Cugino's items because my dad gave me one of the Garlic Schmarlic Dipz packages that he wasn't going to eat that he found after my mother passed away.  That started the ball rolling.  I broke down, visited their website and did a 'sampling' of the majority of their items and I was extremely pleased!!<br /><br />This soup is extremely easy to make, cook some chicken (I've done thigh pieces cooked over low heat on my stove with fresh garlic and I've also done the same with chicken breasts - actually liked the thighs better because they are more tender), shred/cut the drained chicken, add water and Cugino's package, following directions and cook and out comes a VERY tasty soup.<br /><br />Now, like all pre-packaged items, if you're watching your sodium intake, you probably should NOT be using any pre-packaged foods.  This is just common sense.<br /><br />Needless to say, I ended up buying a six-pack from here at Amazon because it saved me a few bucks, didn't have to get a large quantity for the free shipping and since my hubby enjoys eating soups 24/7 I did the subscribe & save to save a few more bucks!!<br /><br />If you're on the fence about trying this, give it a go!!  I honestly believe you'll be pleased with this product.  If you're hesitant, do like I did and visit their site first and pick up the items that you're interested in and/or their own little 4 and 5 sampler packs to help people out.

review/text: Great soup, its like the adult version of cup-a-soup, great when you are sick.  Good flavor, especially if you use home cooked chicken or add in some real broth.  No overly powerful flavors that you don't want when you need to remedy a cold and not too salty.  Most stores have stopped carrying this brand, not sure why as its great, but Cugino's website has a list of stores that carry it.  Walley Wold Super Centers also seem to stock it at a great price if you just want one package.

This product has the benefits of Moringa, Ginger and Tea. I used to feel heaviness and GASTRIC after my meals, now the ginger in this tea helps to soothen my stomach, clears the gas, helps for digestion whatever I eat. No more GASTRIC feeling.<br /><br />I have started buying their Ginger and Lemon Moringa Tea. Now, my whole hiking group have started using this product and we are happy to find this product.

Shared with all, and saved some for me to enjoy later. Being an Italian, this was as good as a salami as I have ever had. Better than the salami I had in Rome too! Makes the mouth water and craving for it again now! Best to enjoy in moderation, it is a high sodium food, but oh so good and worth the guilty pleasure! Made some sandwiches too with spicy mustard! Only thing missing was sharp provolone cheese! That they won't deliver to an APO AE address, bummer. Enjoy and time for me to order some more!

review/text: I bought this for my fall wedding.  First, not much for the money.  Overpriced product, overpriced shipping.  Most of the shipping cost was probably for the useless gel pak to keep it cool, which didn't serve it's purpose.  Either the chocolate got too hot or its from last Fall.  It was a small bag of chocolates - a pound doesn't add up.  The chocolate was gray and somewhat deformed.  The texture is awful.  Grainy and powdery.  I will not use them for my guests.  I would be ashamed to serve it to them.  I will stick to cheaper and fresher M-n-M's.

review/text: We are really happy with the improvement in the new Keurig Vue system, however this is an area where they need to look at Tassimo. The cappuccino provided with the Vue is a 2 step system like the Tassimo, but it is a powder not a liquid. On several occassions, we had powder spill down into the cup before the water brewed. More importantly the taste does not compare to a real cappuccino or the quality in the Tassimo. Again, we are really happy with the Vue and will be keeping it, but if you are huge cappuccino fan you are going to be disappointed.

review/text: If you enjoy a Gew&uuml;rztraminer that is true to its varietal strengths--floral nose, lychee and citrus flavors, with a bit of pear--AND you enjoy sweet wines, then this is a winner. If it has any weaknesses, they are in the relative lack of Gew&uuml;rztraminer spiciness and a slightly vegetal finish. Otherwise, this is a fine value in a white wine. Will pair nicely with fruit, desserts, and Asian foods. Or enjoy it alone.

review/text: These chips are quite literally a mixed bag.  If not for the yucca chips (I think it's the yuccas), this would be a solid 5 star bag of chips.  The problem with the yucca chips is that they are very hard and difficult to chew.  The reviewer below who complained of jaw problems after eating them was not off the mark.  I had minor jaw pain myself after eating them.  I am not sure why, but half to most of the bag consists of these undesired tooth killers.  They are also the chips with the least flavor out of the bunch, so I'm guessing they are also the cheapest to produce.  It's a shame, because the yuccas are really dragging this bag of chips down and keeping me from recommending it.  Get with it, Terra!

review/summary: Possibly the best chips I've ever had
review/text: These are indeed some of the best chips I've ever had, but there's a caveat. One of the types of chip in the bag is much harder than the rest, sometimes almost painfully hard if your teeth or gums catch it just right. It's the light, semi-translucent chip, the yuca I think. Anyway, this would be a 5-star product without a doubt if that chip was removed or replaced. The others though are worlds above any name-brand chips or potato chips out there. Another good thing is what it lacks; no artificial preservatives, no cholesterol, very little sodium and very little carbohydrates. They are certainly a welcome break from all the garbage sitting on store shelves, in taste and in health.

The plain is good but the Mediterranean flavor is my favorite.  Spicy, flavorful, crunchy but not too hard.  Not greasy, either.  The price on Amazon is substantially cheaper than grocery stores as well.  These aren't leaner than your typical potato chip but they are higher in fiber and overall nutritional value.  Try them...I am sure you will be hooked!

review/summary: Another wonderful natural snack
review/text: I have always enjoyed 'Terra' exotic vegetable chips. I have tried their other chip products, however I prefer these because of the variety. If you enjoy this product, I recommend that you purchase it through Amazon so that you can purchase the 1 ounce packages at a reasonable price.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: These chips, which are made from different vegetables besides potatoes are great if you want a different type of potato chip.  However, don't be fooled like me into thinking they are a healthy snack-they are made the way regular potato chips are-fried in oil.  So, if you are not loooking for health food-you ought to try them.

review/summary: Good price for these yummy chips
review/text: Great size and the price is decent compared to buying at my local grocery stores (they don't offer this small size, just the big bags).  My only complaint is there seems to be a lot of broken crumbs at the bottom of these compared to a big sized bag.  But they are yummy!

review/summary: Crunchy but too hard to eat
review/text: The only thing good about this product is the packaging.  The chips themselves are okay, not great.  Very crunchy, but about 50% of the chips in the bags are very hard to chew on.  They are as hard as rocks.  I bought 12 bags a few months ago and still have about 5 left.  For each bag, I can eat about 1/3 (those red and orange chips and taro are not too bad).  The rest of the bag is thrown away because those translucent chips are as hard as rock.  Maybe some people like this kind of chips.  Do yourselves a favor and try some at the grocery first before buying in bulk.

review/text: The last couple of months I've been buying the Terra Blue chips, in the small bags,  Which is such a good idea, I like the fact I know how many calories i am eating,  Well, Amazon was out of the Terra Blue so I thought I  would give these a try and I am glad I did, They're very good,  I like the variety of different chips in the bag, all which are yummy.  Very yummy,  And a super alternative to potato for those of us who are encouraged to rotate our foods,  I'll definitely be reordering these,  They're my favorite now,

review/text: These chips are truly unique. Naturally colored with beet juice, they are festive and great for entertaining. They are super crisp and thin - and not greasy at all. When you first bite into them, it's almost chocking - they're totally chewable, but stronger than typical chips - so when you first bite into one, it's like you're biting into thin glass - it's almost shocking - but good nonetheless. Tasty and light.

review/summary: Good potato chip alternative
review/text: I had some of these Terra chips for the first time a few weeks ago and was honestly surprised by how good they were! I have since tried the Original, Mediterranean, and Sweets and Beets flavors. I liked them all, so I'm looking forward to trying even more of the flavors in the future. There are a variety of root vegetable chips in each bag (varies based on what flavor you buy). I like all the veggie chips I've had, though some are harder than others. Terra chips have a great texture--crunchy like regular potato chips rather than soft and chewy like most dried fruits/veggies. This makes them a great alternative to chips with more nutritional value. I really like them and enjoy having them for a snack now and then. I like the Mediterranean flavor best out of the ones I've tried so far, but they are all really good.

review/summary: Love these Chips - Beware of Sodium
review/text: I love these chips a whole lot! This is also a great deal for them on subscribe and save when I compared it to the normal price I pay per bag in the store. The chips are yummy and taste natural. Some are very crunchy and a little hard to bite so I would not recommend these for elderly individuals or people who need or prefer softer food. My only issue with these chips is that they seem a little salty. Most people I let try them kept commenting on the sodium level as well. I kinda love salt, and don't plan on giving it up too much right now, so they are great to me! The sodium is just a warning for those who are watching their intake to do their research.

review/text: These chips are wonderful, and come in cute little servings. I'm on a diet and find it a lot easier to moderate my consumption with smaller bags of chips. On top of that, they stay fresher, longer. The flavor is fantastic, especially if you are looking for something like potato chips but with a little more flair and flavor. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Buy in smaller batches
review/text: These chips are very, very good. They are flavorful and crispy and some have a great texture. Some, not all. Unfortunately, about half of the chips are extremely hard to the point where no one in my house will eat them. They are so hard, it's almost impossible to crunch through them! It may have been a looming expiration date (I bought 12 of the large bags about three months ago) but as I noticed each new bag having more and more hard chips, I quickly gave them all away thinking that at least someone should enjoy them before they completely go bad because there was no way I would get around to eating that many by myself. So I can't check to see if that was the problem or not but after seeing how many reviews talk about this issue, I'm thinking it's pretty prevalent.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to find a single bag to purchase because while buying in bulk tends to be cheaper, you're just wasting money if you end up throwing a bunch away because it's gone stale.<br /><br />But other than the staleness, I LOVE these chips!

review/summary: Love the Original and Mediterranean Flavor
review/text: I've been a fan of these chips for years. They have a unique combination of sweet potatoes, beets, yucca , taro, parsnips and batata which provide a different combination of crunch compared to plain old potato chips.  I notice the bags are now advertising that there is a full serving of vegetables in every ounce (I never noticed this claim before) but I wouldn't consider them that much healthier than other types of potato chips.<br /><br />What the unique combination of root vegetables do  provide is a variation of color, crunch and flavor. I'm not a fan of the hard red beets, after biting into one I've actually chipped a tooth but I do enjoy the rest.<br /><br />Mediterranean is my favorite, the flavor is outstanding as it's tangy, salty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />The Terra chips maybe junk food but they are up scale junk food with the variation of colors and "exotic" root vegetables and would fit in as perfectly as an appetizer at a social event as they do just straight out of the bag.

Their wonderful. I could do without the really soft stuff. I guess it's totally up to you to get them and try. I definitely would recommend these. I'd also buy these yucca chips in a bag all there own. That's how much I like them:)

review/text: These are great chips.  I buy the 24 pack and they are wonderful for lunches.  Every bag is a bit different and there is one chip I'm not crazy about (the white chip, parsnip maybe?), but there are never that many in any bag so it doesn't bother me.  My favorite is the sweet potato and the ruby taro.  All are crispy without being hard and only slightly salty.  You get the flavor of the vegetables and not just salt and grease like some chips.  Delicious.

review/text: I absolutely love Terra chips.  I have ever since I tried them on a Jet Blue flight.  They have great vegetables that are low in carbohydrates and high in fiber.  The only downside to these is that the fat is on the high end of the scale.  Only 1 gram is saturated, but there are 9 grams total.<br /><br />They are delicious and great in moderation, but for an everyday snack I don't think so.  Something that has more than 50% of all calories derived from fat is not an everyday thing.  Maybe 1 or 2 times a week.  But if you are trying to watch your calories and want to indulge every once in a while. Great product!!!

review/text: These chips are excellent.  I bought them to supplement my weight loss diet with vegetables, however.  I agree it is hard to put them down so if you are allowed only a 150 calorie snack or veggie serving on your diet you will need to have the restraint to measure out a quarter of a 4oz bag or about an 1/8th of these bigger bags and put the rest away.  They are soooo good though it's worth the try.

These are perfect presentation wise for a get-together because of the color variety and texture; they look and taste good! I give them 5 thumbs up! Once you try them you'll be hooked too. A word to those with dentures or sensitive teeth; this may not be the chip for you because some of the chips are REALLY REALLY crunchy.
