review/summary: My Dogs Are CRAZY About These!
review/text: When I ordered these, I thought they were a bit pricey, but I decided to give them a try anyway.  I'm glad I did!  My dogs absolutely love these dried liver treats.  And, since my dogs are all small, I can cut the treats in half and still have large enough pieces to satisfy them. They're great for training; I'll definitely order them again, and would recommend them to anyone.

review/summary: NO waste at all ----  great for training  ----  all dogs love liver treats
review/text: Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%

review/summary: Size inconsistent, needs water
review/text: My dog enjoys these treats in moderation.  Because they are dried, he seems to enjoy them less the more he eats them.  With water, the treats may be much more flavorful.  After having a fair amount, he starts to lose interest in them until he can drink.<br /><br />This brings me to a question regarding serving size.  The container recommends 2-3 cubes per day for a medium breed.  The issue I'm having is that the size of the cubes is so very inconsistent.  Some bits are the size of a pea while others of a grape.  The rest are a variety of sizes in between.  Some consistency would be preferred.<br /><br />Also, this product comes highly recommended for training because it is low in fat.  My dog certainly won't learn anything with just 2-3 of these per day.  Like most dogs, he is highly motivated by food so 20-30 treats is more accurate.  To make this possible, I have to dice them up into smaller pieces or shift through to find the little bits.<br /><br />At least these treats are natural and thus healthier than some of the other options.  I just didn't expect to have to prepare them first.

review/summary: Great for travel, but too expensive, too much prep
review/text: These are great training treats when you need something lightweight that won't make a mess of your pockets. I have a couple problems with them though. First, they are too expensive for every day training. Second, the sizes are so inconsistent that you need to cut some of the large cubes up (at this price, they should be ready-to-eat). Actually there is a third, which is that the powder leftover on the bottom is useless to me.<br /><br />I've found it much cheaper to just put some sliced beef liver from the store in the oven and bake till dry. Cut it up, put it in small portions, and freeze. My dog likes it better than the freeze-dried anyway. I do a whole bunch at a time so I am not prepping frequently. But I figure if I have to prep something, it might as well be something cheap!

review/summary: Two paws up!
review/text: My dog goes bonkers for these treats! They seem to be crazy delicious. Some of the pieces are so small, Lulu doesn't have to chew them; she seems to swallow them whole. I wonder how she even tastes them! But she must, because she whines and acts like a obnoxious brat every time I go near the bucket.<br /><br />I like that the treats don't have any additives. They really stink, though, and the smell stays on your fingers. The smell and the price are the only downsides. Also, I wish the container said how many calories the treats have so I could compare them to other natural treats like Fruitables. The vet said Lulu is getting fat (to which I replied "Yo momma is fat!") and that we should start watching her calories.<br /><br />If you're curious about the consistency of the size of the pieces, please see the photos I posted. There's some variation in size, and when I tip the bucket, I see more crumbly pieces at the bottom, but I don't foresee Lulu turning her nose up at them!

review/summary: Dogs love them, but pieces aren't sized uniformly and they melt when wet
review/text: I buy a big tub of these for my dog about every 3-4 months. He loves them. I do mix them in with other treats, so he does not get a steady diet of them. They are given out as the "special" treat, being one notch above a standard, wheat-free dog cookie.<br /><br />While these are great treats, they are not as "hypnotic" as real meat is. And, given the price, and how inexpensive some good-quality meat is at the grocery store, if you truly want to mesmerize your dog, go with real meat. Its pretty funny that so many of us are paying $7-9 for little bags of dog treats when we could be buying real beef for about $4-5 a pound.<br /><br />However, most of us don't want slimy hands all day, so we use treats. I use these out when walking my dog, and carry them when we go out backpacking or on long day hikes. I like them because they are feather light, but just don't get them wet or they turn to mush. My dog's interest in them after they get wet goes down a lot.<br /><br />I do wish the pieces were more uniformly sized, but they aren't too hard to break apart.

review/summary: Really good treats for training
review/text: I've been using these for my puppy with training and he absolutely loves them.<br /><br />The only inconvenience I find is that, while each piece varies greatly in size, they are pretty large.  So, I cut them up into pieces appropriate to the size practical for training.  Each time he gets one it is just a little piece, and that works great.<br /><br />Since I do cut them up, I don't find these to be expensive at all because they really go a long way.<br /><br />The other important thing is the list of ingredients.  They are not full of junk.  In fact, there is NO junk in them.  Just beef liver.  I like that, as I really try to know that I'm giving him good quality foods and treats.

You cannot go wrong with these because they are all natural.<br />The only thing that I would say is a little disappointing about them is that some of the pieces are very small making them no good as treats.  You end up with liver "dust" when the larger pieces are used.  I generally take this "dust" and mix it into home made dog food for extra flavor.  Therefore, no product gets wasted.

review/text: These treats are 100% beef liver--nothing else. You can't ask for anything healthier than that! Just don't overfeed them. They're treats, not food. Remember that. Your dog would prefer you forget that distinction, because he will love them that much. If you have a small white dog you are probably familiar with the red eye stains. Most people don't know that adding liver to their diet every day will get rid of that ugly stain. Don't exceed the recommended amount. The stain that's already there won't go away, it will have to grow out and be trimmed away by your groomer. But in a few weeks you should notice that white hair is growing in at the base of the old stains.

review/summary: Training Reward-High Protein and Non-greasy
review/text: Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats are wonderful used as a reward during obedience training. For a dog motivated by food, this is high in protein, low fat, and not greasy so that you may keep it in your pocket! Because a great deal of  treats are used during positive reinforcement training, I have found that by cutting the squares into pieces the size of my pinky fingernail, the dog is not being overfed and will be able to take the treat without having to stop and chew it up, clean the crumbs, etc. This product is especially good when training puppies, because it is a soft treat to chew, therefore, no pressure or pain on those sensitive gums while the pup is in the teething stage. I cut the squares up and place them in a plastic container. When the pieces are gone, there are powdery crumbs left which I sprinkle over the dogs food at feeding time. There is no waste with this product. I have been using Pro-Treat for more than 15 years. The quality is excellent, and I found the best price to be on Amazon after doing a considerable amount of comparison shopping.

review/summary: Rolls Royce of dog treats.......
review/text: This product is a real bargain, considering the fact that dogs love liver. I've used this as an addition to another dog treat product I use for my dog. My dog goes nuts when he knows that he's about to be rewarded with<br />Pro-Treat Beef Liver treats. The instructions advise to give 2-3 pieces per day when using. At this rate, the container will last you a good while. The product itself is very fresh and the pieces are all of various sizes and thickness. Average size of treat is small rectangular pieces of different thickness. They're easy to break into smaller pieces if necessary. My Springer Spaniel pup is 5 months old and he just loves these. I tried this product on my girlfriend's 10 yr old teacup Poodle, who is pretty slow at this point in her life. She absolutely came to life and jumped all over the place for a taste of one of these treats. Buy it....your dog will love it!

We haven't had a puppy yet who has refused these and would all but stand on their heads to get a "liver treat."

review/text: My dog is a rescued stray.  You'd think she'd be happy to eat any treat offered to her.  Not so.  She's pickier than any dog I have ever seen or heard of.  I have thrown away many bags of treats and dog cookies.  But these things, she adored.  And since they are real liver, they aren't just processed grains flavored to taste like meat.  I recommend them to any dog owner.

review/summary: Cut the pieces smaller
review/text: The product is wonderful! It stays clean and dry in your pocket and dogs will obey your every command to get a treat. But, it is very expensive and you are suppose to limit the daily amount, so I cut smaller slices of each cube to make it last longer and give my dog less product each training session.

review/summary: Our dog loves them!
review/text: Freeze-dried liver treats are easy to carry around in a treat pouch, don't have to be refrigerated and, so far as I know, are healthy, high-protein snacks without a lot of chemical additives and preservatives. All of those attributes are nice but wouldn't be so important if the dog didn't like them. Our dog, who gets lots of small, bite-size treats as part of his continuing training, gets tired of diced sausage-shaped moist food from the pet store and cut-up franks from the grocery, but he'll run a mile for a liver treat! I do wish they were smaller and/or less expensive. We usually cut them in quarters with a sharp knife to make them last longer.

review/summary: best dog treat-- great for training---  all dogs love them
review/text: Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%

review/summary: Pure Puppy Addiction
review/text: Pro-Treat Freeze Dried Liver Dog Treats / B000255OIG<br /><br />This is the sort of product that makes me wish I could give more than 5 stars... My puppy absolutely adores these liver treats - our dog trainer calls them "puppy heroin". With these treats, training becomes an absolute snap, since the puppy is willing to do anything for his smelly liver treat - and you will have his undivided attention during the entire training session.<br /><br />These liver treats come in cubes and slices about a half inch on each side. I slice them thinly three or four time lengthwise, and then again two or three time crosswise. The liver treats fracture easily, and the taste is so addicting that only the tiniest slivers are necessary to reinforce good puppy behavior. These treats are also low fat and low preservatives, so they are very healthy for your puppy and that makes them even more perfect for training. Really, once you try this treat, you will never need another!<br /><br />As always, purchase and shipping from Amazon was easy and painless, and the liver treats were packed carefully enough that there was no extra treat breakage - which is remarkable for dried treats.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/summary: Travis loves them; inconsistent in size.
review/text: I have ordered these a number of times for my terrier mix (part pit bull?) - usually a little cheaper than in-store.  I initially used them for training only and then found that with the larger pieces I could jam a piece or two inside a chew toy, hide a treat toy or hollow bone that has already stood Travis' test and this can give my dog hours of enjoyment.<br /><br />My issue with them - and why I went with a 4 instead of a 5 - is the size of the pieces are inconsistent.  My first couple times there was a good mix of some larger squares - 3/4" - 1" cubes and smaller that I use for training bits.  My last order was completely smaller pieces - making it difficult to use it inside a toy/ bone as they come out too easily. Play time no longer lasts as long.<br /><br />I am hopeful that my next order in line with the others and have a mix. I would have given it a 5 prior to my last order.<br /><br />As a training treat these are AMAZING.

review/summary: Great treat to use as a high value reward!
review/text: My 4 month old aussie loves these! Whenever he's fixated on something (like another dog while we're on a walk), I quickly wave it near his head to redirect his attention. It's one of the only treats that can bring his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze-dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training). They aren't especially smelly, but some dogs can smell them yards away. I've been followed many times at the dog park by doggies that smell the leftover powder in my jacket pocket!<br /><br />The downside is that when I cut it into too small of a piece, it can crumble apart. Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool. The tub says that only a few should be fed per day, and it is to my understanding that too much liver isn't good for the dog. I've uploaded a picture of the feeding guidelines that are printed on the side of my 21oz tub and I'll also provide them here:<br />-------------------------------<br />Weight........................3 Times Daily<br />-------------------------------<br />10-30lbs....................1 to 2<br />30-60lbs....................2 to 4<br />over 60lbs..................4 to 6<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />So, for example, for a 60lb dog, about 4 pieces can be fed up to three times each day. Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces. I hope I'm not missing something here?<br /><br />I've also uploaded a photo of the front of the 21oz tub showing that it is made in the USA. It has a May 2, 2014 expiration date printed on the underside of the container.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!

review/summary: Doesn't get much better
review/text: I was pet sitting recently and the dog I was sitting for had these in her treat pouch. She loved them so I tried them with my dogs. All 3 dogs were quite well-behaved whenever they saw me reach for these goodies. My son and I jokingly call them "doggie crack". They're good for them, they work as training tools, what else can you ask for in a dog treat?

I used the powder to coat bland chewy dog treats, dog food, toys, etc.

review/summary: Love these... or at least my dog does.
review/text: These are a great deal when compared to the small bags of treats available at the pet store. More importantly, my dog adores them. I use them as an extra special treat, usually just for when he goes into his crate. As soon as he notices that I have one in my hand, he runs to his crate and waits, tail wagging. The only downside is that the liver cubes smell horrible (to humans, anyway) and leave a powdery residue behind. But as some other reviews have noted, the powder is great for sprinkling on dry food for a finicky dog.

review/summary: Great treat, but probably not for small dogs
review/text: These treats are similar to the PureBites, however, since I have small dogs (Peke mix), I generally don't give them these snacks because they are more suited for medium and large dogs (or small dogs with large mouths). Smaller dogs have a hard time biting down on them and there is the possibility of choking because the pieces are too large and dense for their small mouths, so I have to break them up into smaller pieces before I give them to my doggies. The PureBites, on the other hand, are flatter and easier for them to chew. The snacks appear to made in the same way, so if I had larger dogs, I would give them either this snack or the PureBites.

The fact that the pieces are irregular is not a drawback and is not surprising.  I do cut up the larger pieces as I don't want to give them too much at once.  The prospect of getting one of these treats makes them much more receptive to training and just coming when you call.  Also, we find the largest size very economical as you don't pay for shipping.

review/text: My 2 year old German Shepherd loves this treat.  I keep it on my counter as a quick and handy treat for "mini, spontaneous training sessions".  The only issue I have is that most of the treats are a bit big and difficult to break into smaller pieces which is necessary for obedience classes where we go through many treats.  Therefore, I do not use these treats for that purpose.  (The container recommends only 3-4 cubes per day for large dogs).  Having said that, they are an excellent treat for occasional use and I would highly recommend them.

review/summary: My dog would do anything for this treat
review/text: By far this treat is the best one that I have bought.  We used it to crate train out puppy and whenever he saw us going for the bucket or smelled it being opened he would run for his crate and sit in there until we gave him this treat.  The large bucket is the most economicay, but it does have a really strong odor when you open it; for that reason we always keep a small ziploc with the treats in it that we use regularly and only open the bin to refill that bag.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the sizes of the treats varies incredibly - but if one is too large we just split it, we will give 2 of the small ones, and the powder and bits at the end just go in his dinner one night for an added treat!

review/summary: Pistachio mix? More like nut mix.
review/text: We just bought the 6-pack of these nuts and were NOT impressed. It's a bit of a misnomer to call this a "pistachio mix". They could just as easily be called a peanut mix, almond mix, etc. because there's hardly ANY pistachios in these. In the six bags we received, the almonds seemed to account for more than 50% of the total mix. What few pistachios we did find were small and didn't taste very good.<br /><br />If you like pistachios, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00355CNFW">Wonderful Pistachios Roasted and Salted Shelled Pistachios 16 Ounce Bag</a> instead. If you factor in the pistachio:nut ratio in this Planters package, the Wonderful product is far superior.

review/summary: Off-taste
review/text: Having used virgin CO for a few years now, decided to try a different brand from my regular, since this 3-pack was a good price (I try to pay under 50 cents per ounce).<br /><br />This product has a more prominent flavor than my regular (Nutiva). I enjoy coconut flavor, and so this wouldn't really be a problem except that it has a noticeable off-character. I tastes spoiled (though it's not). If you have children you may recall the scent of spit-up milk from an infant--that's the flavor. It's hard to palate! This is likely the result of the processing method. This may be a "traditionally-processed" (Philippine method) oil, in which the chopped coconut is allowed to ferment in order to separate the oil. Other cold-processing methods avoid this fermentation step and extract the oil mechanically. Both result in a minimally-processed, truly "virgin" product (as opposed to a refined oil which is further processed with heat and solvents to remove flavors and other natural components). Also this has a grittier texture than I'm accustomed to.<br /><br />Two stars for overall quality (and I'm just a big fan of coconut oil), but beware of the stronger and unpalatable smell and taste.

review/summary: better than expected
review/text: I had read about the different uses for coconut oil (in addition to cooking) and decided to buy some and give it a try. I read reviews of all different kinds and finally decided on this one. I was pleasantly surprised. It has a light, sweet smell. The pack of 3 was convenient for me because I could keep 1 in the bathroom, 1 in the kitchen and give one to my mom. The temp where the item changes from solid to liquid is around 78 degrees. As the temperature has been warmer, yet I haven't turned on my AC yet, it spends more time in its liquid state. But when its solid, its still easy to scoop out what I need. As soon as it hits the skin, it begins to liquidize. It massages in easily. It also makes an excellent lip balm. The container suggests that it be used as a substitute for butter. I think it will work well (although haven't tried it yet). I recommend this product. Priced well.

review/summary: Only Brand I'll Use
review/text: I've been using Now Foods Organic Virgin Coconut Oil since 2010 for a variety of uses. I have a medically fragile son that was born severely disabled and had frequent, life threatening pneumonias. Since I started using Now Foods Organic Virgin Coconut Oil, he has not been hospitalized for pneumonia in 18 months. His doctors are amazed at this. I melt 1 tbsp per day and give it to him through his feeding tube (be sure to flush with really warm/hot water or it will clog the tube). It helps prevent colds, flu and pneumonia and I use more (up to 4 tbsp a day) if any symptoms are coming on.  I tried other brands (Nutiva, 365 brand) and they didn't work as well. The Nutiva Organic Virgin Coconut Oil didn't work at all on his symptoms so now I only use Now Foods Organic Virgin Coconut Oil.<br /><br />It is also fantastic as a beauty treatment. I put some in a glass dish with a plastic lid and place it in my bathroom. It diminishes fine lines and wrinkles, reduces pore size and makes your skin look amazing. I cleanse my face, dry it and then put it all over my face and leave it on overnight. My skin has never looked better. It's also the best makeup remover you will ever use and it's organic and all natural. Excellent for eye make up removal. I also use it as a moisturizer in the winter under my foundation. Use a much smaller amount (versus what you use at bedtime) and then apply your foundation as normal.<br /><br />It's also great for cooking-I use it to make organic popcorn and use coconut oil instead of oil. Perfect for pie crust, grill cheese or anything where you would use oil. Plus it has a higher set point than other oils so it won't burn.<br /><br />It's great too for burns of any kind. A fantastic product.

review/text: I got this NOW virgin coconut oil when my usual brand (Tree of Life) was not available.  Comparing the two, NOW is more gritty and not as smooth (in solid state) as ToL. Now also has more of a coconut flavor.  Both are fine for cooking, adding to smoothies, using on skin, and eating from the jar, I guess it just depends on personal preference. Both products are good for you and backed by well respected companies. I personally like ToL better.

review/summary: Wonderful!  Great for GAPS diet.
review/text: I ordered this date sugar because I had a recipe for GAPS-legal brownies that called for 2 3/4 c. date sugar.  The first time I made the recipe I bought dates and put them in my food processor--I didn't realize you're supposed to dry them in the dehydrator first!  So I ended up with a huge sticky ball of very sticky date "sugar" that I used.  Some portions of the date got stuck in the sticky, sticky ball of stickiness without totally being blended so I got little chunks of date in my brownies.  I had trouble blending the sticky date ball with the butter and cocoa, and it was tough to mix into the rest of the recipe.  It wasn't the end of the world, and the brownies were good, but the texture was a little off.<br /><br />SO, I ordered this date sugar and I've made the brownies again.  Holy smokes, it was so much easier!  Instead of buying this date sugar, you COULD buy a bunch of dates, dry them out in a dehydrator, and put them in a food processor.  I won't do that again though, because that takes a bunch of time, and it cost me more to use dates from the store than it cost to buy this already turned into date sugar.<br /><br />The texture of this date sugar is uniform enough that it works well in recipes, but the color and size of the granules varies enough that you know it comes from real food instead of being some sort of chemical product.  The date sugar is quite sweet, and very easy to work with.<br /><br />I will definitely continue to buy this date sugar.

review/summary: Yummy for chubby puppies!
review/text: My little dogs really like these.  I like that they are a light formula so it isn't quite as guilty a pleasure for them.  Also, these treats are just about the right size.  They aren't large but are big enough my dogs can make 3-4 bites out of each.

review/summary: Received wrong item
review/text: I ordered the light roast, but received a collection of different flavors.  My husband does not like flavors.  The description did not say different flavors and the picture here does not match the picture on what we received.  Ours says includes coffee house regular, chocolate glazed, cinamon and decaf.  The item ordered does not say that.  I think it was a fluke and we got the wrong item.  Can you please send us the correct item?  I've never had this problem with amazon before.  Thanks.  Mary
