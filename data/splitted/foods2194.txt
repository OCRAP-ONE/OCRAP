review/summary: I'd rather blend my own
review/text: Why, oh why, can't I get straight Dutch processed cocoa? I bought this blend by accident (thought I was getting DP cocoa because of tricky labeling) and was severely disappointed. I use a lot of cocoa, and this blend is still sitting in my cupboard after 9 months. Time to search the internet for another company that sells DP cocoa.<br />Attention Hershey's, in the meantime, what are we to do for recipes that use DP cocoa???<br /><br />PS. This Hersheys blend tastes worse than than the two parts. IMHO DP and non-alkali cocoa should not be blended until just before using.

review/summary: Absolutely dreadful
review/text: I gave this one star because it is impossible to give it zero.  As others have mentioned, the old, silver box "European Style Dutched Cocoa" was my standard for any recipe that involved cocoa - cake, brownies, cookies, anything.  Then a few years ago, they replaced it with this crap.  And it is crap, absolute crap.  The distinctively darker color that resulted from using the old cocoa is gone, as is the taste.  Now it's worse in comparison to even the original hershey's cocoa.<br /><br />There is absolutely no reason to buy this product.

review/text: For the last 20 years I have traveled to Wautoma Wisconsin (120 Miles) to buy Silvercryst French Dressing as it was the absolute best French Dressing I have ever tasted. I found this dressing at a local food store and have not seen it before so I bought a bottle and WOW this stuff is better than Silvercryst Dressing. Now my local store is not carrying it so I decided to do a google search and found it on Amazon.com. So when my current supply runs low I will be ordering it from Amazon.

review/summary: This salt will change your life
review/text: Those searching high and low for salt that will change their life can end their journey with Murray River Sea Salt.<br /><br />I first stumbled on this salt at a local outlet of a cultlike nationwide chain store that pretends to sell only the highest quality foods but also happily lends its imprimatur to made-in-China foods that sometimes turn out to be tainted.  But, ignoring other controversies associated with that store, one day a package of this salt sold by that store stirred my interest which led to the salt completing the last step of its long and probably ecologically-unsound trip from Australia to my kitchen.<br /><br />Here's the thing about Murray River salt:  Its pinkish flakes are fragile and crumble easily in your fingers.  It also seems to dissolve almost immediately on contact with food.  This is in sharp contrast to every other salt I've tried.  We currently have 6 or 8 other kinds of coarse-crystal salt in the house.  None of them can be crushed in your fingers.  They remain large, hard chunks of salt.  Yes, they represent other flavors than the Murray River salt, but there is something gentle and friendly about this salt.  I have a totally-unsubstantiated theory that this salt is better for your body than the hardened crystals of other salts.<br /><br />Our household keeps Murray River salt in a salt cellar (in our case a small lidded wooden bowl) from which it is pinched with the fingers (instead of using the traditional tiny spoon) and crumbled directly onto food on the plate.  For sanitary reasons, only a small amount of the salt at a time is put in the bowl.  That way the bowl gets cleaned frequently.  Frequent cleaning seems like a necessity when fingers, even washed ones, are the tools of choice for dispensing the salt.  Words to the wise: If you invite nose-pickers to your table, provide a salt shaker and hide the Murray River stuff till they've left.  If you have small children in your home, wait until they are grown and are draining your bank account at the safe distance of some far-off college before purchasing and placing this salt on your table.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that they use this as a finishing salt.  Our household concurs.  We rarely if ever add this salt to anything in the cooking process.  We keep Kosher salt and a couple of sea salts for most larger-salt-use cooking needs, like baking (which frankly seems like the only time one should add much salt to the cooking process).  But this is the good stuff for your table and the food you serve on it.<br /><br />The chain store mentioned above no longer carries this salt so Amazon is the logical alternative.<br /><br />Note that I purchased a 1lb bag, which keeps well because I live in a desert.  But next time I'll probably purchase a multi-pack of the smallest bags for a small amount more per unit weight in exchange for the convenience of having smaller packages.

review/summary: Delicious and Fits into My Newly Rediscovered Healthy Lifestyle
review/text: I picked these up because I was tired of having my insatiable sweet tooth destroy a full day of healthy eating. So far so good! They are quite crunchy but very chocolately and, although I prefer milk chocolate over dark, these really hit the spot.<br />I'm not sure about the prebiotic/probiotic thing yet, but as these claim to be prebiotic and the Leclerc website recommends eating them with probiotics (prebiotics are food for probiotics), I paired them with my DanActive. I'm not sure how much benefit I'll see over time but the combination tasted great! I hope the probiotic thing does work because supposedly they are helpful to people with gastrointestinal issues (that roughage that is so important to a healthy diet wreaks havoc on my stomach). I haven't had any bad reactions to the combo, and it actually seemed to calm my stomach on one occasion. So, all things considered, I'm very happy with my new dessert.<br />They sell these at my Costco here in Houston, but I haven't seen them elsewhere.

review/summary: Taste Rather Good. Even My Little Boy Likes Them.
review/text: I enjoy a few snacks and deserts, but I try to keep such things healthy. That is, it has to taste good and be satisfying in that sense, but it also has to add essential ingredients to my total diet and not just empty calories. Of course, the problem with most snacks, candy and chips etc., is that they only add empty calories. They might taste good but they're high on fat, sugar and salt and low on everything else, including fiber. The problem with healthy snacks is that they tend not to be any good. It's tough. Well I found yet another item, and that is Leclerc Praeventia Dark Chocolate Cookies. They're little somewhat dry, flat, heart-shaped cookies with a rich chocolate taste. They say the chocolate is 70% cocoa. Plus, they're whole grain and contain a goodly source of fiber and no negative ingredients, such as trans-fats. Plus there's a long list of other impressive ingredients. Well, they also taste pretty good. I even give a few to my little boy (3 1/2) and if he eats them that's a good test. He does. If I had any complaint, it's that they're rather dry. Just counter that with having something to drink nearby.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: These cookies are so good that I'm super sad when the single serving package is empty.  I allow myself only one pack a day though.  I'd been buying them on Amazon when Target no longer carried them.  Now I just recently noticed that our local Walmart has them--yea!  The chocolate and the ginger ones too.  These come highly recommended by moi!

review/summary: Very Happy Dog
review/text: And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating.

review/text: I always bought stuffed olives from a booth at our local holiday market.  This past Christmas, the vendor did not return.  I was desperate to find stuffed olives as they had become a staple in my husband's stocking.  (He does not hide disappointment well)  Most online vendors selling stuffed olives charged a FORTUNE for shipping (up to $15 in some cases).  Ordering these through Amazon saved me a fortune.  I would up with three jars for the price of what it would have cost me to ship one jar from other merchants.  The olives were delicious and a hit with both my husband and my father.  They like things that are hot and these really delivered.  I would not recommend these for people who like medium heat.  These really pack a punch.

review/text: I purchased these olives a few months ago and they are fantastic. The hanenero olives are not as hot as others that I tried. But they are good. The olive itself is large tasty. They are not too small like some other olives out there. I highly recommend these olives. The price has gone up since the last time I bought them, but getting similar olives at the store cost more than this anyway.

review/text: This is hands down the best flavor. Remember when you were you kid, and that sucker would be in your mouth for who knows how long, and you get that wrinkle feel inside your mouth from the suckers? This flavor will actually make it much worse. You'd be so focused on the tart lime flavor you'll begin to think that you have developed a problem. It would also seem, as if once i get to the gum center, i immediately must have another one. I want that Lime flavor to numb my mouth.<br /><br />You people, you people just don't understand. This stuff is like crack and the availability on store shelves is almost next to zero. Without Amazon, i don't know what would have done to feed my addiction. Prolly Girl Scout cookies but that's another dilemma.<br /><br />By offering a 3 @ 48, it's like a crack addicts best dream.

review/summary: Golden delicious, healthy and caffeine free!
review/text: The name says everthing about this lovely tea.  Sweet chamomile apple is like drinking a golden delicious apple.  The scent is strongly fruity and chamomile. The flavor is apple, chamomile and honey--a wonderful golden flavor that is soothing and while sweet, not cloying.<br /><br />Chamomile tea is known for being a nerve tonic, settling upset stomachs, and soothing menstrual cramps and headaches.  Having a cup before bedtime is a nice way to relax.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

review/summary: What to expect from processed foods...
review/text: My best friend came over three weeks ago and I had made Tabbouleh, but made with Quinoa instead of Bulgar. He loved it, in fact, everyone that I had try it was hooked. But then he mentioned that real Tabbouleh is made with Bulgar and that we should try that to see how it would work out... so he went on a quest and found this product on Amazon. I have to say, if I would have known that he was purchasing a product that all the ingredients was inclusive, this product would have never been purchased. Not to be offensive, but his is a product for people that are either lazy, non-cooks, on the run, or that just don't care about their health. If you are going to make Tabbouleh, make it with FRESH ingredients.<br /><br />So, my friend ordered it... it came in two days and when opening the two boxes... yes, it was very nicely packaged, but even at that, two packs were broken and the content was all inside the box... not a big deal. but then is when I noticed that the product he (my friend) had ordered, was an all inclusive product. I cringed, and figured I would try it and give it a shot. If you like lemons... lots of lemons, you might enjoy this product. It was so bad, that I called amazon, told them I was highly dissatisfied and I was refunded the complete purchase price.<br /><br />This is a perfect example of a company processing ingredients together to make it easy for the consumer, but please do yourself a favor, if you are going to make and serve such a delicate dish, USE FRESH ingredients. This is a super food that should never be sold all inclusive.

review/summary: bulgar wheat from my favorite site:  Amazon.com
review/text: I had never tried preparing bulgar wheat before, had no idea how to season it, so I purchased the box of 6 oz bags (pk of 12 with herbs)of Melissa's Tabbouleh.  The seasonings in it were too strong and I didn't know how to prepare it either, but going by the instructions that came with it I couldn't eat it.<br />  Unless a person really really likes to eat lemon rinds, I doubt if they'd be able to eat it.  We weren't.  The problem is I got an oversupply of it and ended up tossing it all.  Next time, if I try eating bulgar again (which I might because I'm trying to make more healthy food choices and I don't doubt the value of bulgar) I would instead buy it plain and season with our personal favorite seasonings and use that as a starting place.<br /><br /> This is not the fault of the company that made this product, it is entirely my fault for not knowing what I was purchasing.

review/summary: Has Consistency Issues, but Overall Great
review/text: I was looking for a nutritious snack and always have been fond of almonds, but at the supermarkets in Providence they tend to always be over $10/lb. Additionally, they are often not roasted properly and tend to just taste gross.<br /><br />Back To Nature California Almonds are only about $6.80/lb, are roasted very well, and unlike other brands like Blue Diamond, which are incredibly salty, these almonds have only slight amounts of salt which doesn't give me bloating or headaches.<br /><br />I have just finished my second 3-pack of Almonds, I go through about three a month. My only issue with them has been each 3-pack has had one package that has been of poor quality. The almonds in these packages taste very bitter, somewhat soft, and just plain unpleasant to eat. Even though I don't expect all of the almonds to be identical, it would be nice all of the bags were of excellent quality, instead of two-thirds of them.<br /><br />Overall, these almonds are a very solid and healthy snack, and a great value.

review/text: These were excellent quality almonds and they probably tasted excellent when first prepared. But everything has a shelf life, and these almonds taste "old". The expiration date on the package was April 2012 (I got the shipment in first week September 2011). Storage conditions make a big difference. At the right storage (cool) temperature the salted almonds can preserve flavor. But, if exposed hot summer days in someone's basement, then taste deterioriates rapidly. Sorry, but thumb down for taste.

Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  The longer or more intense roasting makes the nuts crunchier.<br /><br />PRICE COMPARISON:  At the time of this writing, both "Back-to-Nature" and "Blue Diamond" almonds are about 50 cents/oz <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>  The Blue Diamond almonds come in more convenient 6 oz cans, but may be less environmental freindly.

Most Americans exceed their daily salt intake by two or three times the FDA suggested intake.  Finally you have a lower sodium dry roasted nut that is fresh, roasted to perfection and reasonably priced.  If you want more salt, lightly coat the nuts with some olive oil and break out your salt shaker.

review/text: I only gave these a 4-star because I was disappointed in their not being saltier as you would expect when seeing "seasalt" on the label.  They just taste like the average roasted, salted almond.  They were very fresh and natural tasting, however, but I was craving an edgier, salty flavor and I won't eat chips to get that.  This is a much better alternative to chips for a treat as it's high protein with a great helping of fiber.  Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts to eat, especially raw, for their high fiber and I believe B vitamin content.<br /><br />Back to Nature is one of the better and much fresher brands so stock up while they are on special! :)

Many bites have no raisins at all - just a plain, neutral-tasting biscuit.  I don't remember the Sunshine cookies being crunchy, so that was also a disappointment.  Also, $15.00 is a lot of money to spend on a tin of biscuits this size.  I couldn't find these in the Asian market near me, but that's the way to go if you want to try these out (way cheaper).  If you're looking for something similar to the sadly-discontinued Sunshine raisin cookies, this isn't it. Try Crawfords Garibaldi Biscuits - they're made with currants, but they're much closer to the original.

review/summary: Long-lost Raisin cookies
review/text: My dad always used to eat the long packaged raisin cookies.  They disappeared from the grocery stores sometime in the 1980's.  When I saw this product, I just had to order it!  We have since eaten all of them!  I can't say they are exactly like the ones I remember, but they are pretty close!!  I would recommend this product, for sure!

review/summary: Over-baked, left nasty brunt aftertaste.
review/text: While attempting to locate Sunshine Raisin Biscuits, I found these on Amazon. They appear to be similar to what I was use to enjoying<br />with the Sunshine product. The similarity ends with the picture on the tin canister. The biscuits are over baked with burn marks on<br />both sides. They are frail and crumbly, not soft and chewy, with several biscuits broken into small pieces possibly due to the poor<br />manner of packing in their canister. What appeared to be the raisins was a dark rubbery substance that did not chew well, the biscuit<br />part was bland and after several bites I had a nasty burnt aftertaste in my mouth.  Spending $15.00 plus shipping on a tin of biscuits<br />this size only to discover it is undigestible and non-refundable. This was a disappointment.

review/summary: Flavor check
review/text: I ordered this because (a) we love chewy Runts, and (b) I've 'owed' my husband a packet of chewy Runts for over a year, and I can't find them in stores.  The packets and box arrived quickly and in good shape.<br /><br />I'm taking away one star because the description doesn't list all the flavors in these packs, and my packets are missing my second favorite: the pink (strawberry) hearts.  I thought those were always included, so I was bummed.  I'm taking away another star because I just re-read the description, and it claims that the packets include new flavors like pineapple (my 3rd favorite) and mango.  Neither flavor is present.<br /><br />The packets I received include banana (#1 fav!), red hearts, orange, grape, and green apple.  I'm sad about the pink hearts and pineapples, but I will still enjoy what I received.

review/summary: The perfect size for the Mr. Dudley Nutmeg Grinder
review/text: Legend has it that if you keep whole nutmeg in your kitchen, your marriage will last. Would keeping 10 whole nutmeg seeds work even better? I'm willing to give it a try, although I think Nutmeg creates warm comforting aromas and adding nutmeg to your baking is sure to make your cooking seem more nurturing.<br /><br />Nutmeg is actually native to the East Indies and was very popular from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century. It is one of the original spices cultivated in Tidore and Ternate, two tiny Spice Islands in Eastern Indonesia.<br /><br />The best nutmeg is now grown on the Island of Grenadain in the West Indies. A yellow peach-like fruit is harvested with a woven wicker basket attached to the end of a long pole. The inner seed is the nutmeg spice and is superior when freshly ground. The red-orange net/aril covering the outer seed is dried and ground to produce mace.<br /><br />This nutmeg is the perfect size for the Mr. Dudley Nutmeg Grinder, so you always have nutmeg in the house. You may also want a copy of "Is there Nutmeg in the House" by Elizabeth David.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Better yet, if I am out of my own and don't have time to make it, I use the Kitchen Basics Unsalted Chicken Stock. I always have some in my cupboards for back-up.<br /><br />I also use their unsalted beef stock.

review/text: I have been using Kitchen Basics stocks (wide variety of types) for over 10 years when I first discovered them at Trader Joe's.  About 8 years ago TJ's stopped carrying them so its been a hunt ever since to find them.  But now that Amazon carries them I can easily keep them on hand.  I really like the unsalted ones (they still have some salt, I guess from the source ingredients). They can be greatly reduced for sauces without becoming too salty.  However, even the regular ones have less salt than most other brands.  They are far better than College Inn, et. al.

review/summary: Not 100% raisins -- Contains Additive  ---  UPDATED 10-25-12
review/text: I purchased the Made in Nature "Club Pack" size because the price was good and the description seemed identical to the Made in Nature product sold as a 12-pack of 6 oz. bags.  The latter product had the following listed for the Nutrition Facts link:  "Unsulfured, Sun-dried, Certified Organic Seedless Raisins."  In other words, no additives are listed.  I thought that the Club Pack size would be the same, even though the Amazon description did not include a Nutrition Facts link.  Well, I just got my order today and the packages listed "organic sunflower oil" as an additive.  Also, it is disconcerting that the package does not specifically state that the raisins are unsulfured.  I will not be purchasing these raisins again.<br /><br />Update:  I increased my rating after checking further and finding out that the raisins are unsulfured.  Also, the added sunflower oil is apparently less than 1%.  Nevertheless, this information should be listed on the web page.  Sunflower oil apparently reduces clumping of the raisins.  Personally, I would rather have clumping and no sunflower oil since I do not want extra sources of fat in my diet (especially ones that are high in Omega 6 fats).  The raisins themselves are nothing special....they are average in both taste and appearance.<br /><br />UPDATE #2:  After reading recent reviews on this product, I decided to check the Made In Nature website to see if sunflower oil was still being added.  The package label on the website still shows the additive.  However, I sent an e-mail about this to Made In Nature and got the following reply:<br /><br />"Thank you for contacting Made In Nature.<br />We are pleased to hear that you are interested in purchasing our products through Amazon and understand the importance of consumers such as yourself, to be absolutely certain of the ingredients used in products. Currently, we do not add any organic sunflower oil to the raisins, and haven't done so for the past few months. We are also in the process of removing it from the cranberries as well. Our ultimate goal is to have all of our products include only the dried fruit itself.<br />I hope this helps and answers any question you may have regarding the ingredients used in our products. If you have any further questions, comments, or concerns, never hesitate to reach out. Thank you for your support in Made In Nature!<br />Brian McQuillan<br />Made In Nature"<br /><br />As a consequence of this new information, I plan to order the raisins again.  If product is similar in taste to my first order (and if the product contains no sunflower oil), then I will increase the number of stars on my rating.

review/summary: Great price for organic raisins, not thrilled with the added oil.
review/text: These raisins are good quality and the price is excellent.  I bake a LOT of raisin bread - several loaves per week - and was pleased to find an organic bulk product at this price-point.  I am torn about the addition of sunflower oil to prevent clumping.  I would find this a little gross if the raisins were going to be eaten out of hand, but have to admit that for my purpose, the oil is a benefit - I don't have to spend 5 minutes breaking up clumps of raisins before adding them to the dough.  The raisins will seem a little small if you are used to conventional raisins, but if you're familiar with natural, organic fruit, you'll be pleased with the quality.

review/summary: excellent price for great tasting organic raisins
review/text: I got 6 packs of these raisins and don't regret getting so many even a bit. They taste great and the price is better than anywhere else I could find - even our local coop cannot come close to this. Ingredients list: Organic Raisins and Organic Sunflower oil. So make sure you are not allergic to sunflower seeds.<br />I use them for my morning cereal and one pack lasts about 4-5 weeks as I use a generous amount in my bowl (in my opinion). My view is that these are truly organic because they are mostly smaller than conventional sunmaid that use chemicals to grow them bigger.

review/text: I was almost deterred from buying these raisins because of the negative remarks about the sunflower seed oil. I'm really glad I got these. They are not oily at all. They are very plump and sweet. I had been buying the bulk Sun-Maid raisins at Costco but I noticed that they had lots of stems and were very dry. The Made by Nature raisins are more expensive, but also organic and much higher quality. I eat them almost everyday in my oatmeal, use them in bread, and snack on them. Highly recommended.

review/summary: No more sunflower oil!
review/text: I order these raisins regularly. I didn't like that they had sunflower oil in them, but since the bulk organic raisins at my local health food store also contained the oil and were more expensive, I kept ordering these Made in Nature raisins from Amazon, because they are the cheapest organic raisins I have been able to find. The raisins in the last order I got tasted terrible - all three bags - and I didn't think I'd order them again (because while they're the cheapest organic raisins I've found, they aren't cheap at almost $8 a bag).<br /><br />Fortunately I gave them one last try because I hadn't found an affordable alternative yet. I just received my order today. I noticed right away that the packaging design had been changed slightly, so I looked closer to see if anything else was different. Great news, for those of you who also weren't happy about the added oil: the raisins I received today only have one ingredient - organic seedless raisins! They taste MUCH better than they did when they had the added oil, and are less clumpy, too (the raisins in the last order I got were horribly clumpy). I hope this is a permanent change!

Comments about oily raisins and such.  Well I finally made up my mind and went ahead and took the plunge.  Boy am I glad I did.  I simply have never had raisins that tasted this good and did not stick together like one solid brick.  When I first opened the bag I thought, ok here it goes.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  They were not oily at all.  So I'm not sure if some folks got a bad batch or what but these are perfect.  I use them for baking and they taste wonderful.  So I will be buying again.

I think the innards are pure gelatin and sugar.<br /><br />Do be aware that these come in a variety of packs containing different numbers of bars. At least as of the time of writing, these do not all work out at the same cost on a per bar basis. So it may well be worth your while doing your homework before deciding which deal is right for you.<br /><br />Enjoy in Moderation!<br /><br />Theo.

review/text: I was stationed at RAF Lakenheath Air Base from 1971 until 1978.  I was introduced to Turkish Delight by my wife,<br /> whom I met while stationed in your great country. When I was discharged from the Air Force in 1984, my family would<br /> return to England because of my wife still having relatives. I always made it a point to purchase Turkish Delight.<br /> As my children grew older they would visit their relatives in Peterbourgh.  On their return they'd always make<br /> sure to bring old Dad some Turkish Delight's.  Some of my co-worker's made several trip's to England and I'd ask<br /> them to visit a candy shop and pick me up some bars of Turkish Delight. Back in May a good friend of mine was<br /> going to visit Liverpool and London.  I asked her to look for Turkish Delight and pick me up several bar's.  She<br /> was in such a rush during her she never got a chance to purchase my favorite.  I miss my Turkish Delight.  Thank<br /> God for the computer age.  Something told me to look up Turkish Delight on the computer, and low an behold I found<br /> your company.  I think I purchased over a dozen bars of your product.  I am a diabetic, but I usually have a bar<br /> of Turkish Delight once a week.  After I placed my order I think I received it within 5 days.  I was really<br /> impressed with the quick delivery.  I don't to wait for my family members making a trip to jollie old England to<br /> get my favorite candy.  I really love Turkish Delight.  It's gotten to the place I have to hide of supply of bars in<br /> my freezer from my wife and kids.  I'll be placing another order before Christmas so I'll have a supply to share with<br /> the family,  Thank You; SLL. cOLS. oh. USA

review/summary: Excellent Milk Chocolate Sampler
review/text: Ordered during the day, got it during the next morning.  Excellent quality, and well-packed.  A little pricey, but don't eat it like Hershey's, and savor it.

review/summary: The Best Chocolate Around
review/text: This is without doubt the nicest chocolate I have ever had. I had it years ago and was very pleased to see it now available through Amazon. It turned up in the US the day after it was ordered very nicely packaged and delicious. The packaging is quite substantial and insulated. Great service from Amazon and Leonidas.

review/summary: EXQUISITE CHOCOLATE!
review/text: This is the best Belgian Chocolate I've tasted. The shipping to the customer is first rate. Defineately give them a try. I prefer these to Gopdiva chocolates. Yes, they cost more than drugstore chocolate but they are well worth the cost. The packaging is as pleasing to the eye, as the chocolate is to the palate. The Belgian's sure know their chocolate!

review/summary: Awesome chocolate. Great company
review/text: I have received the chocolate as a gift from someone who brought it from Belgium. I ordered this for my husband and the company accidently sent Milk Chocolate when I had ordered Dark Chocolate. I called the company and explained the error. They sent the dark chocolate overnight to correct the problem and let me keep the milk chocolate. I was very happy with how they handled the error. I would definitely buy from them again.
