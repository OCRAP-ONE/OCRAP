review/text: These jerky sticks are really good. They aren't fatty like most sticks and I really like the taste. I find I like these much better than typical beef jerky. The packaging and size are also great. I recommend these for anyone who likes jerky or is looking for a low-fat/high-protein snack-on-the-go.

review/summary: Overall great meat snack
review/text: It's healthier than most meat snacks, and it is filling. Great for those moments that you are either too busy or too lazy to make a meal. The fact that it's individually wrapped allows you to always carry one with you. I leave some at work for when I get hungry or for when I am so busy that I don't have time for lunch. My favorite flavor is the original, followed by the peppered. This is also a great price per oz.

review/text: I am really glad that I found the Ostrim snacks.  They have a nice meaty texture and are not oily like some of the other beef sticks out there.  I haven't tried the other flavors, but the natural is quite good.  I particularly like that they have 14 grams of protein.  Honestly, one stick and piece of fruit is a substantial "snack" that keeps you full for a while.  It's great that Amazon offers them on ship and save - - makes the price really affordable, too!  Try them, you'll like them!

review/text: Great quality meat sticks for a good price. These cost no more than a comarable size slim Jim and taste as good or better. The best part is the nutritional aspect. 80 calories, 1.5 grams of fat, 14 grams protein and 300 grams of sodium. Great snack option to bump your protein intake.

review/summary: Addictive, healthy beef jerky
review/text: As I become more aware of the nutritional values in foods, I try to find a good balance between taste and nutrition.  Ostrim has done it with this product.  I love regular beef jerky, but wanted a lower fat/sodium snack.  At 60 calories per pack with 1.5 grams of fat and only 290 grams of sodium, I found the nutrition I wanted in my jerky.  The taste actually exceeded my expectations, yes it is lower in sugar and sodium, but it still has a good meaty flavor and is much like a lean cut of meat.  The pepper flavor is light, but compliments the meat instead of overpowering it. I have now been eating this jerky for over a year and still think it is a good "healthy" snack for when I have to have some jerky.

review/summary: High protein snack
review/text: Finally, a high protein snack which really is just that- high protein, without excess fat or carbohydrate. VERY good for almost any diet, but especially for a low carb OR low fat diet. Require no refrigeration, easy to carry around, fairly easy to open. These sticks, at 1.5 oz., are larger than many similar products out there. One consideration- these are a bit higher in sodium than I would really like to see, though no higher than other similar products. The only problem I have had with these is eating too many! I have tried another flavor of these, and found the teriyaki flavor to be better.

review/text: Unlike protein bars that are trying to be a candy bar, and unlike most meat sticks, Ostrim is low in fat AND carbs (especially sugar). It has also got a good amount of potassium, which I really appreciate. If your are not a vegan or vegetarian, you will find that these are a good tasting and uncompromising way to get high quality protein as a snack instead of some garbage at the convenience store. Despite delivering only 80 calories I find this snack to be a satisfying way to hold myself over between meals.

review/summary: Best Jerky Ever
review/text: I purchased an Ostrim High Protein Snack at a juice bar after the gym one day, because of its high protein/low carb/low fat properties, expecting it to taste like a stick of cardboard, and was surprised at how good it was. I purchased a second snack as a novelty item (Ostrich meat) for my teenager, who loves beef jerky, and was stunned when he thought it was delicious. I immediately ordered two cases of Ostrim from Amazon (MUCH cheaper than buying them retail), and now my son takes one to school everyday for a midday snack. Who knew there could be healthy beef jerky that tastes great? Ostrim is AWESOME!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CU0N36">Ostrim High Protein Snack, Beef & Ostrich, Natural Flavor, 1.5-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 20)</a>

It is low calorie (80 per stick), low fat (1.5g and only 15 fat calories) and high protein (14g).  If you like beef sticks try this and you'll probably like it.  I've tried the Pepper and the Natural flavors. Both were good, but I liked the pepper just a little better. The pepper flavor is not overwhelming, just a little spice to it.

review/summary: OK Tasting "Protein" Snack
review/text: I bought these as an alternative to protein shakes, tuna, or cold cuts when I wanted a quick protein-based snack.<br /><br />I have only tried the Natural flavor.  They're a bit salty and taste very similar to slim jims, but they are less greasy and MUCH larger.<br />Packaging is easy to open and not messy.<br /><br />The problem is the protein content: Just 14g/42g according to the nutritional info.<br />For reference, a standard can of tuna has two servings of 14g/58g protein.  A scoop of protein powder is about 28g of protein.<br />Also, despite what the product description states, it has 1.5g grams of total fat per stick.<br /><br />In short, a decent, but expensive, product if you are looking for a slim-jim style snack.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to protein powder for cheap protein, cold cuts/tuna when I want a protein-based snack, and some nice specialty Jerky when I want splurge on something chewy and flavorful.

review/summary: Major Ostrim Fan gets Major Food Poisoning - Timeline of Events
review/text: As someone who has been a fan of Ostrim products for the past five years, I have probably eaten 300-400 of these high protein snacks without incident.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011. In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1,000 dollars per month for one person, I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks (3 x 20) in regular, barbecue and teriyaki flavors. Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future, I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks.  I was dead wrong.<br /><br />After about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature, several of the shrink-wrapped air-tight sticks started inflating like balloons. This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition. The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrink-wrapped state were placed in a refrigerator.<br /><br />About a week later, I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets.  This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events, which are chronicled below.  Suffice it to say, about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks, I became deathly ill.  I am 99% certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled, high protein diet at the time where every food, calorie, and gram of protein was being monitored.<br /><br />The symptoms were so severe, I thought about going to the hospital. My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening. It took about three days to recover, which meant three days of zero productivity. In the end, a regular Ostrim consumer became someone who cringes at the very sight of the Ostrim display at my health club.<br /><br />Timeline of Ostrim Food Poisoning<br /><br />Event..........Date..........Time<br />Order from Amazon..........2/11/2011<br />Package Arrived ..........2/16/2011<br />Discard of inflated (decomposed) ..........

review/text: I've been doing the Dukan low carb diet, and these are the best snack I've found so far. They're lean, tasty, and good for you. If you're trying to do a low carb diet, or even just snacking healthier, these are a great addition to the pantry.

review/summary: Where is the pepper?
review/text: Ostrim beef and ostrich snacks are pretty tasty. I expected them to be a bit spicier, but they are good as they are. I needed another protein snack to supplement protein shakes and protein bars. The whole ostrich thing piqued my curiosity so I bought them. They are convenient to carry in my pocket while at work and the price is right. I will almost surely buy more.

review/summary: Pretty tasty for what it is, maybe a little too big?
review/text: High in protein, low in fat, not greasy but you know you're eating a meat snack.  Smoky flavor is pretty good but I find that about 3/4 of the way through I'm about done with it, it starts getting just a bit too dry and a bit too bbqy.  I've been breaking them in half and eating the other half later.  My dog was quite thrilled with it when I left it on the table.  After reading that it was the #1 sports nutrition meat snack on the label, my 7 year old son started requesting them for his school snack, then began asking for extras for his friends.  I wonder if there is a #2 sports nutrition meat snack?<br /><br />I use these and several similar products to boost my protein intake on days when I'm running a bit low.  Perfect as one of a handful of tools suitable for that purpose.

review/summary: Good, but super salty
review/text: I like this product a lot and I think they're very tasty, but SO SALTY. I'm one of those people who love a lot of salty foods and will always add salt to everything I eat, but even I think these are way too salty. Luckily I like them enough and the nutritional stats are great, so I'm going to stick with them. My only other complaint is I just got my second order and the outside of the stick is SO tough, like it's stale. I'm hoping it's just a fluke with the one box, but if it continues, I may have to cancel my order, as it was pretty bad.

review/text: I like the taste and the satiation factor of the product.  The protein, calorie and fat ratios are near ideal.  And, did I mention convenience; convenient?  I've ordered these on the timely delivery program.  Also, I like the lack of greasiness feel to them.  I keep them stored in my freezer to ward off any mold problem that I've seen claimed (I do appreciate those comments for giving me a "heads up").  These are a great product that I recommend.

review/text: These protein sticks have a very strong "gamy" flavor. It's hard to describe -- it's not sickening, but it is weird. Also, they are extremely dry. Having purchased them, I'll finish them, but I doubt I will buy them again.<br /><br />*Update* On second thought, I may have to throw these out. I've eaten them twice, and both times they caused me some moderate gastrointestinal distress.

review/summary: Great Tasting and Satisfying!
review/text: I've been looking into finding more high protein snacks with low carbs and calories and this snack fits the bill.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the high sodium content.  I'd really like to see a lower sodium version of these sticks, even if it's just removing 100mg of sodium would be great.<br /><br />But it tastes great, everyone in the family likes them.  I've tried the spicy pepper from a local store and loved it, but it would have been too spicy for the kids so I purchased the 2 boxes of terriyaki from Amazon.  I'll probably buy the spicy again and just horde it for myself while getting bbq as well so the kids can have those.

review/text: I love the taste of these sticks and their high protein content, no issues there. My problem with this product is that it creates, for me, a case of explosive, deadly, gas. And I mean deadly as in clearing the family room during prime time deadly! Not sure if it's the milk content (I am lactose intolerant), or what other ingredient may be causing it, but I now only eat one or two of these a week. Again, could just be me, but wanted to warn others of this benign, but potentially humiliating, side effect.

review/summary: Jerkee not jerky
review/text: Maybe I should have picked up on the name "Jerkee" but this is not even close to regular jerky. I don't actually mind the label on front that says "nonfat dry milk added, chunked and formed" but I'm weirded out by having sucralose added to my jerky. I can also say that although the flavor (pepper) is nice, I am definitely not a fan of pink soft flat moist "jerkee."  Its texture is kinda like eating raw hamburger meat yet it's extruded appearance makes it even less appetizing. Some people may love it but just be aware that this is not jerky. I used to buy the Wild West brand of jerky here on amazon. It's flavorful and not very sinewey or tough, yet it's real jerky. I'll force myself to finish this stuff and then go back to that or try another brand.

review/text: I was excited to get a healthy protein treat and I was hugely disappointed.  I opened the first one and was appalled by the smell. I managed to choke down three bites and the only good thing I can say about this stuff is that it didn't make me sick immediately. I threw the rest away. Later I went back in the kitchen and thought I smelled where my little dog had an accident but it was only the open package reeking from the trash.  I have eaten homemade  ostrich jerky but this tastes nothing like it. It is hard to believe it is ostrich. Do not buy this product. Even my cats and dog couldn't eat it.

review/summary: Zesty
review/text: I usually buy orange and lemon zest for cooking, when I don't make my own. I decided to get this for a new toothpaste recipe I picked up. Yeah, that sounds strange, but if you make your own toothpaste you don't have to worry about how much fluoride you are getting in it, and it is probably one-eighth the cost of commercially prepared products.<br />I decided if I was getting fluoride in tap water, I didn't need it in my toothpaste also. And now I am not sure I need it at all. It sure didn't seem to prevent cavities for me. So, since I can't find non-fluoridated toothpaste under $6 a tube at the store, I am going to be going for the Zesty life. Their lemon zest is great also!

review/text: In the midst of boring over salted snacks, where a gallon of water is required for the ingestion of most potato chips, is the only chip worth taking a horse and buggy for. Tri-Sum potato chips have a unique, addicting and satisfying taste that nothing else compairs to.<br />I have been many places across this country and have never had the pleasure of tasting anything close to the delectable and crispy spud snack made just minutes away from my childhood home.<br />In a world of fads, tradition is found in the stranges places, and Tri-Sum potato chips are a Massachusetts tradition that will never die.<br />In fact, I still ship bags to friends all over the country at christmas time, by request because its an unforgettably delicious taste.<br />Tri-Sum are always my go to snack, and I suggest trying them with this warning attached, "If you Tri-Sum, all other chips are done!"

review/summary: Excellent dog food; especially good for dogs with health problems
review/text: We have three dogs- a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear, and two large dogs with health issues: a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer, who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago, and an 8 year old  collie mix who has irritable bowels.  Trying to find the right food so that I didn't have to purchase too many kinds of dog food for two dogs with disparate health issues was not easy, but this Wellness Simple Solutions, along with the Wellness Core Dry does the job.<br /><br />If you suspect that food triggers allergic or stomach/bowel reactions, as any pediatrician will tell you, feed a simple diet with as few ingredients as possible, and only add ingredients as needed, after waiting for a time to watch for reactions.  Simple Solutions is the way to do this, and for a dog with irritable bowels, it is truly THE best way of feeding a commercially prepared dog food, instead of you cooking chicken and rice for your dog.  The dogs love the taste, and Wellness brand is excellent quality.

review/text: My 8-year old Cocker Spaniel has been on several types of food (Nutro, Iams, Natural Balance, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers Soul, and regular Wellness). She would tolerate each for a short period of time, but then get diarrhea and would vomit. Our Vet suggested we try Wellness Simple Solutions, since it has only one protein and one carb source. We've had her on it for 3 months and she's shown no signs of upset stomach or irritable bowel. We suspect she is sensitive to chicken/chicken by-products, which the Rice and Salmon blend does not contain. The food is expensive, but it's worth the cost to have a healthy dog.....and clean house!

review/text: I have tried quite a few brands and types of kibble but none work as well in helping my Bichon to avoid skin problems, particularly itchiness, as this one does.  It helps that she really enjoys the taste too.<br /><br />Update: January 2012:<br /><br />Wellness Simple Solution Rice and Salmon is the only kibble that I feed to my bichon.  She loves it and I love the way it helps with her allergies plus the fact that she never has any digestion problems.  I use to buy the smaller bags because I was concerned about freshness.  Before finding this on Amazon, I had to special order it at a local pet specialty store and very often the packages had short time frame expiration dates.<br /><br />After seeing how good the dates were on the smaller packages that I bought from Amazon, I switched to the larger 10 lb,8 oz. bag.  I have been absolutely delighted by the freshness.  The bag that I ordered in early January 2012, arrived nicely packaged and with an expiration date of July, 2012.<br /><br />I'm happy that not only am I getting a wonderful food, made in the USA, but I can count on getting a fresh shipment too.

review/summary: dogs,too,are what they eat
review/text: we thought lily,at only 6 years of age, had about a year left to live - she was that weak and sickly. we wondered how our beautiful, strong german shepherd had failed so quickly. we decided that we had nothing to lose and perhaps it'd make her last days or months more pleasant if we took her off her natural supplements (glucosamine,msm,yucca), as well her pharmaceuticals. at the same time, we decided to change her dry dog food from a well-known brand we got at the supermarket to a more natural one. we did research and decided on Wellness Simple Solutions. we chose this one specifically because it had so few ingredients. lily was having alot of g.i. problems - she frequently vomited and it contained alot of mucus;she was itching alot and developed very scaly patches on her skin. she was a mess! her zest for life was disappearing. But, that was 3 months ago! lily no longer vomits; her itching has improved 85% or more; her coat is shiny and beautiful (people admire her wherever she goes); she goes on 45 min. leash or free walks/runs now, where just 3 mos. ago she was only able to go 15-20 mins. i attribute Much of her recovery to Wellness. it's so gratifying to see her feeling so Well again!

review/text: This is the only dog food that we've found to work well for our small dog with many food allergies. The ingredients are simple and the pieces are small enough for little dogs to work with. We've been using this dog food for almost four years and he still loves it.<br /><br />It does smell like duck so if you are sensitive - be warned. :)

review/summary: Finally, some peace
review/text: Our dog has tried several foods, including expensive vet brands, and has been treated for ear infections, skin infections, and was constantly scratching and licking. We even tried other limited ingredient foods, only to have it upset her stomach and cause new problems. I bought this at the store thinking, "Okay, salmon and rice. This seems safe!"  I hoped that the fish would be good for her skin and the rice would be easy to digest.  We have been using this food now for a couple of months and she LOVES it, plus her scratching is gone and this food has never upset her stomach. It is sometimes hard to find in the pet stores so I'm buying on Amazon again. It saves running all over town, and the price is lower.

review/summary: Solved our skin issues
review/text: Understanding not all skin issues are alike, this food seems to have solved our issues.  My labradoodle developed a skin irritation that turned into a nasty infection in late november.  She was on Wellness Super 5 and salmon oil.  We thought it was just bacterial and dosed with antibiotics, but the irritation/infection came back worse than before.  I had tried grain free(Wellness Core), but things got worse, if anything.  We had to do another round of antibiotics due to another infection fromt he irritation and I felt like I was out of obvious solutions.  My vet suggested changing the type of protein to seafood(she has always been on chicken), so I tried this type of food.  Within a week of being fully transitioned onto this food, her excessive shedding (that started in november with the infections) had gone away and her skin had stopped developing lesions.  It's been almost a month and thing look great.  It could all be a coincidence, but I don't think I will be changing her food anytime soon!  Seems like a great solution for her.  Definitely worth trying!<br /><br />UPDATE July 28 2012<br />This formula (Salmon/Rice) has been changed to Salmon/Potato.  The number of ingredients have nearly doubled.  After months of doing so well on the Salmon/Rice food, I transitioned her onto this new food and her symptoms are re-appearing and she is not doing well.  This is a big disappointment.  I called Wellness and they said this food wasn't selling well and they changed the formulation.  Too bad - I will have to try another brand that is truly a limited ingredient diet.

review/text: I have three dogs, and one of them kept having bouts of diarrhea.  My vet gave her antibiotics and other prescription drugs to resolve the problem. These would work for about a week, and then the problem would return. My dog groomer suggested that there might be a food allergy involved.  I looked on Amazon.com and saw the "Wellness Limited Ingredient Diet for Dogs with Food Sensitivities Simple Food Solutions" dog food. I noted that the primary ingredent was lamb instead of corn...I ordered some and the first day I fed it to my dogs, it worked!!! My little dacshund Sugar had no more diarrhea or sickness from that day forward. I feed it to all my pets and I believe that they are actually happier now.  I am too!!!!

I have been using Wellness products since both were puppies and specifically the Wellness Simple brand since I discovered the allergies.  My female lab used to have persistant ear infections but since I started using the Simple line of dog food - the problems have disappeared.  I rotate between the duck and lamb flavors and she seems quite happy.  Never tried the salmon flavor.  I also treat both dogs with the Wellness biscuits (peanut/honey is their favorite).  Quality dog food well worth the cost!  My female lab is almost 7 now and the male is 5.  Both love the food and are very healthy.  Thanks Wellness!

review/text: Even our vet could not cure the red bumps on my dog's skin.  The rash and excoriation was unresponsive to oral antibiotics and topical steroid spray.  Our pet sitter recommended we try a dog food without known allergens, so we tried Wellness Rice & Salmon.  It really works! Our dog still gets some redness but she is so much better.  The only negative is that apparently the food doesn't taste that great. Our solution is to mix it with a very small amount of canned cat food (about 1 tablespoon of our cat's Newman Organics), and our dog gobbles it right down.

review/text: I honestly wish the other reviewer would have not given this product such a poor review. While the kibbles are not small in this food (about the size of a lima bean in length and half a grape in girth), and I do believe that this product is perfect for medium to large dogs, this is most definitely a quality dogfood. My lab-mix has suffered a great deal in the past from skin problems, and since changing to this food, he has improved 85%, and I am thrilled! Don't let a bad review dissuade you from trying this; it's great! And perhaps the small to teacup sized dogs could try the cat food in this brand, which my dog and cat love! The cat food kibble is the size of a small pea. To good health and happy feeding! :)

review/summary: Revised opinion
review/text: Update 11/12/11: I previously posted a review on the Simple Solutions Lamb & Rice Formula a few months ago, which I have since deleted.  I gave it a negative review because my dog, a miniature long-haired Dachshund, initially did not want to eat it. I would mix it with his old food, a good quality mostly all protein food (Orijen) that he loved--Orijen gets 6 stars at dogfoodanalysis.com, which is why I chose it. My dog would pick out the Orijen and leave the Simple Solutions in his bowl untouched.  However, my dog was getting constant ear infections that would not clear up with medication. I spent quite a bit on vet bills. I finally decided to try a different dog food to see if there was an allergy and tried Simple Solutions. As I said, initially he did not like it, but I continued to give it to him, and now he's eating it just fine.  When the Lamb & Rice almost ran out, I decided to try the Duck & Rice formula, which I'm slowly incorporating into the Lamb & Rice.  He really loves the Duck & Rice food and literally jumps up and down when he knows he going to be fed.  Also, the ear infections are completely gone.  I think this is an excellent food for dogs with sensitive stomachs or allergies, which apparently includes my dog.  I do wish some of the stores close to me would carry it though so I didn't have to purchase it online.  Fortunately, Amazon is selling it with free shipping, which was pretty fast also.<br /><br />I want to add that dogfoodanalysis.com only gives Wellness Simple Solutions 4 out of 6 stars because of the protein level, which is why I haven't given my review 5 stars. It states:<br />"Overall, we are happy with the quality of most of the ingredients in the food. The ingredient list is deliberately simple and designed for allergic dogs who may not tolerate a wide range of ingredients. We have concerns, however, at the apparently low level of meat content of the food."

review/summary: Good food for sensitive dog
review/text: I've been feeding this dog food to my older female pug for several months now. In the fall of this year she began to experience allergy related skin and stomach issues. These allergies resulted in excessive licking and nibbling at her feet as well as occasional throwing up. She hasn't thrown up since she started eating this food, and overall her skin issues have lessened (that could be a result of the change in seasons as well). She is always excited to eat her food, but what pug isn't? I mean they're always hungry right? Also, as she never seems to drink enough water, I'm glad she's getting some moisture as part of this soft food as well. The only thing I find displeasing out this product is that we buy it in cases, and the cans frequently arrive dented. I wouldn't buy dented cans for my own food, for fear of the food being tainted in some way. So I feel a little nervous feeding my dog some of these dented cans. Oh well, she seems fine thus far and the smell and look of the food is fairly consistent, so we're going to stick with this food for now.

review/summary: not much better than I the salmon flavored one.
review/text: Obviously, any dog's reaction to various foods are dependent on their own allergies.  I switched from Wellness Simple Salmon because of the fishy smell of the food and my pit/lab's fishy breath. If it wasn't for the fishy breath, I would have kept him on it. I was actually very pleased with the results of that food.  I decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve.  His breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog, but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks.  He has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor.  We have had to mix 1/2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken, rice, and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal. But at any time we feed him just this dog food, he will have extremely watery diarrhea.  Quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it.<br /><br />Not quite sure what we're gonna do next. We might have to put our hyper allergic pit/lab mix on a homemade diet because that seems like the only thing that works for him.

I am such a fanatic that I cut down several young coconuts fresh from trees while on trips to both Hawaii and Puerto Rico and those were not even as good as this product.  I've been fortunate enough to also sample fresh young coconut juice once while on a trip to Thailand and while, admittedly, this product was not quite as good as having it fresh off the tree in Thailand, it does give you an approximation of what that is like.

review/summary: The Best, Most Authentic Coconut Water - Amazing seller!
review/text: I just got back from Thailand, and  I think I drank at least one coconut per day.  Upon my return I wanted to find something that compared to the original (it's hard to keep coconuts in the fridge!)  I thought Zico was ok, but it tasted watered down and nothing like the Thai Coconuts I was used to.  I tried Amy and Brian's on a whim at whole foods and fell in love.  It's naturally sweet, so flavorful, and I love the pulp's texture.  I was hooked.  Finding it here at an amazing price was the kicker.  I saved SO much money, which is good because I didn't think I could afford my new addiction.  Thanks for the fast, free shipping!!

review/summary: Best Coconut Juice Our There
review/text: The other reviewers are right: hands down the best coconut juice out there. The flavor is natural, good-bodied, and with none of that tinny after-taste you get from supermarket brands. One 17 oz can is amazingly filling and low calorie, which makes this an ideal mid-afternoon snack with none of the suspect ingredients in protein bars. With summer coming up, here's a tip: we also use Amy & Brian coconut juice in our hotel bar to mix unusual and refreshing cocktails - big hits. We prefer the version with pulp.

review/summary: Rehydrates Cancer Patients
review/text: If you're going through chemotherapy or radiation you truly know how dry a mouth can get.  A whole body can get.  This juice was the only thing we found to alleviate that dryness.  It's slightly sweet, but not too much, making it easy to get down and stay down.  While this may not be appetizing to non-cancer sufferers, it means the world to someone going through cancer.  It's price makes it a bit prohibitive, but believe me, the cost is worth it!

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I was recently introduced to coconut water and really enjoyed it, however it was one of the sugar added brands that only had 80% juice (with pulp). After some searching, I found some pure coconut water (for twice the price as the sugar added one) at a grocery store and was eager to try it only to be let down. It was decent enough, but pretty bland. There weren't other options, so I searched Amazon. Amy and Brian's was a great deal compared to the bland grocery store option and had good reviews so I ordered a case.<br /><br />A couple cans came slightly dented as others have mentioned, but it clearly happened during shipping and did not compromise the product in the least. When I finally opened a can, I was so excited by the amount of pulp in it (a lot!). Even better, they had the same sweetness as the sugar added ones but with a much cleaner taste. They use Thai coconuts, which are naturally sweeter than others. I love the pulp - it's really soft, so you can easily drink without chewing it. I've got a major sweet tooth but I've been working on eating better. A cup of it after dinner or throughout the day provides just enough sweetness to curb my dessert cravings, especially taking the time to chew the pulp. I definately enjoy it more at room temp too.<br /><br />A wonderful side effect I've noticed is it helping with dry mouth! A medication I'm on causes pretty bad dry mouth and this helps much more then those dry mouth mouthwashes. It's rehydration properties are amazing for hangovers too(or preventing/lessening them when drinking a cup before bed).

review/summary: An Excellent Coconut Beverage!
review/text: I love coconut water and juice beverages, and I've tried the majority of coconut water/juice brands out there ranging from Zico, Vita Coco, O.N.E., Harvest Bay, C20, Naked, etc. I've tried coconut juices/waters when I traveled to places such as Hawaii, South America, and Thailand. I've actually also drank straight up from real coconuts while I was in Hawaii, South America, and Thailand as well. In my humble opinion, the country that produces and makes the best coconut water and juices is Thailand. Maybe I'm a little biased because I'm Thai American, and the majority of my relatives live in Thailand. But I've traveled to Thailand many times in my life and drank coconut water and juice beverages several times while in Thailand. The Thai-based brands that Amazon currently sell are: Amy and Brian, Taste Nirvana, Nature Factor, Foco, and Chaokoh. And of course, as a Thai American, I've drank from all these Thai-based brands as well. They're all pretty good - Amy and Brian, Foco, and Chaokoh have been around for a long while when it comes to coconut drinks. Foco is a Thai-based company that make many Thai exotic drinks including dragonfruit, basil seed, mangosteen, chrysanthemum, lychee, and even pennywort. I've tried many Foco drinks over the years, and even had their canned pennywort drink in February of this year at Ha Long Bay restaurant in St. Petersburg, Florida (By the way, that Ha Long Bay restaurant has an excellent variety of delicious Boba Teas. I love Boba Teas! The best use of boba pearls I've ever seen was when my sister and I visited a Yogurtology store in St. Petersburg, Florida in early June. You get your choice of frozen yogurts self-serve style, and then you put whatever toppings you want. They had different flavored boba pearls to choose from besides fresh fruit and other dessert toppings. My sister and I thought that was a great idea, putting boba pearls on top of frozen yogurt. Yogurtology is a new chain of stores based in two states so far, Arizona and Florida, and it's such a great place, that they should have this chain nationwide!) and it was the most unusual drink I've ever had so far in my life. It tasted different and unique at first, but I read on the Internet that Pennywort/Gotu Kola is supposed to be good for your body helping strengthen your immune system, reduce arthritis, and helping alleviate other health-related issues. There's even a blog on the website, Too Many Chefs, and people have been exchanging, over several years, their opinions on what they thought about Foco's Pennywort drink. I never read that blog until after I drank the Pennywort drink in February. The reason why I chose that drink is because the name caught my attention at Ha Long Bay restaurant's menu, and I'm often the curious type who always tries my best to try something new at least once. It's kind of amusing to read people's opinions on that Pennywort drink. Chaokoh, besides their coconut drink, make the best coconut milk to cook Asian and Thai meals at home. My family uses Chaokoh coconut milk all the time to cook Thai meals, and Chaokoh also sell a lot of canned Asian/Thai items such as: rambutan, longan, bamboo shoots, sugar cane, banana blossom, and jackfruit. Taste Nirvana, of course, is known for all their coconut beverages and their Thai teas and coffees. They also sell Thai chili sauce as well. And finally, Amy and Brian are known for their excellent coconut juice beverages. Amy and Brian also sell an amazing line of mangosteen juice beverages. In the end, when it comes to the best tasting Thai coconut beverages, Amy and Brian and Taste Nirvana are tied for number one. (In fact, Thai coconut water is so good that even my favorite tea company, Harney and Sons Fine Teas, currently sell Taste Nirvana products directly from their website. They admit that they love Thai coconut water and beverages. Click on Harney and Sons' bottled beverages link on their website and you will see what I mean, and Taste Nirvana is not their own brand or product! Now that's a true testament to how excellent Thai coconut water is! I'm being really truthful when I say that you haven't really tasted good coconut water or juice if you haven't tried Amy and Brian or Taste Nirvana! I've been drinking Amy and Brian's coconut juices (with and without pulp) for many years now, and the majority of coconut waters out there don't measure up to this brand (or Taste Nirvana). You truly get your money's worth when you buy Amy and Brian's drinks.

review/summary: Fabulous tasting coconut water...NOT unnaturally sweet in the larger cans. YES, too sweet and AWFUL in the small cans.
review/text: I was leery of trying the Amy & Brian's again after having this experience: AMAZING pulp-free tall cans. Horrible candy-water 10 oz cans. So, I have several cases of the short cans I refuse to drink. Awful. But I went through the cases of the tall cans. Wonderful.<br /><br />I wondered if the inconsistencies would show up in the tall cans, and I did not reorder. THEN..this big sale and sub/save showed up. Tempted me. I ordered TWO cases of this one, with the pulp.<br /><br />WONDERFUL. I like it even better than the pulp-free (which is weird, as I normally avoid pulp-containing packaged coconut water). I even found myself enjoying chewing the bits of pulp.The flavor is NOT too sweet, very nicely coconutty, not at all sour or weirdly salty like the new Zico, nicer than ONE and VitaCoco.<br /><br />So, I feel free to order more now. Clearly, there is some issue with the smaller cans. I strongly recommend you avoid those like the plague. They taste nothing like coconut water. They taste like you dropped some generic sugar candy in water and let it dissolve. Really icky sweet and NOT AT ALL coconutty. (I have had fresh out of the shell coconut water since childhood, my family being from the Caribbean, and have tasted virtually every brand available locally and on Amazon, and I know coconuts vary according to region and even harvest areas etc. Coconut water IS variable, so I don't expect homogeneous flavor. I do expect it to be coconut water and not candy water (or corn cereal milk like new Zico)). So, yeah, avoid small cans. Amy & Brian really need to look into why that stuff is disgusting, cause it's ruining their reputation whenever someone tastes that horror.<br /><br />The Tall Cans: Yes, buy these. I've sampled out of four different cases sent to me, always good. The pulp-free was more sweet compared to the tetra pak CW's I've tried, and the higher carb count makes sense. I even emailed the A&B people about it, and they said it was due to the blend/selection of coconuts that theirs is sweeter with a higher carb count. I can see how the selection could do this. I like the sweeter flavor, personally, but always have with meals cause it is higher carbs. When I want to drink coconut water by itself--I choose a lower carb variety, like original Zico was or ONE in a smaller quantity than the 17.5 ounce can.<br /><br />Thumbs up. Refreshing, sweet, coconutty, lovely. I love, love, love this coconut water in the TALL CANS.<br /><br />But I beg the Amyy & Brian folks to investigate and revamp the processing for the smaller cans. That stuff is vile and I have two cases plus sitting in my kitchen that I cannot drink. (Add that to the Zico I can't stomach and preordered and that's a lot of my money going to waste cause companies can't get it right/screw with a tried-true formula).<br /><br />Happy sipping!

review/summary: Great taste, bad shipping
review/text: Easily put, the stuff tastes good. Fresh, slightly sweetened but not overly so, coconut pulp. It's delicious.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I think someone had too much fun joyriding the UPS truck, because each and every one of my cans when I opened the box was dented. The cans seemed pretty tough, so not a single one broke, but it's unnerving imagining just how much punishment the box went through in order for them to get THAT bad.<br /><br />Also, on another note, the can itself is deceptively heavy. Every time I'm almost done drinking one, the weight of the can will trick me into thinking there's more inside. Sadness.
