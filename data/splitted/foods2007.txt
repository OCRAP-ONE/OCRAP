review/summary: Best Marinara Sauce Ever
review/text: My entire family agrees that this Cucina Antica garlic marinara sauce is the most delicious prepared tomato sauce we have ever eaten. Way better than Rao's, for example. So good that my 3yr old daughter asks for a bowl of it straight up to eat like a soup.

review/summary: Cinnamon Honey Disapointment
review/text: Product arrived on time and was well packed.  The first problem was that one jar was not closed tight and  the half the honey leaked out into the packing.  The second thing we found was the honey was very thin and could be poured like water.  The flavor was good but you had to be very careful putting it on bread as it would soak through the bread very fast. I would not recommend this product.

review/summary: NOT the same flavor as it was 10 years ago
review/text: Just an FYI: Juicy Fruit "re-engineered" their flavor in 2003 after getting criticism about the amount of sugar in the gum and it's NOT the same as the Juicy Fruit you chewed as a kid. Now it's got aspartame (artificial sweetener) and the taste is overpowering and bitter.<br /><br />When I was a kid, I loved the taste of Juicy Fruit so much I wanted to *eat* it, not just chew it. Not anymore. Now it just tastes like every other sugar-free gum on the market- too mushy, too soft, artificial "tang", and too weirdly sweet.

review/summary: Gum is delicious but it does have aspartame
review/text: I was recently told to lay off the artificial sweeteners.  I was/am a big fan of Extra Bubble Gum and Extra Polar Ice but they were out of my routine.  Remembering a favorite from my youth, Juicy Fruit, I ordered that.  And in bulk because I do chew a lot of gum.  When it came I was surprised to see that Juicy Fruit did have both sugar and aspartame.  The gum is fine I just thought others should know about the aspartame.

review/summary: juiciest of fruits
review/text: the taste the taste the taste is gonna move ya!  I remember that catchy little jingle back in the 80's when I was young and watching morning cartoons and Alf.  It's a perfect melody for a wonderful and sunny girl-chasing day on the surfboard!  Back then we didn't realize how silly such a song is.  Nowadays such innocent stupidity has been replaced by... a man in a dance competition and attempting to win a Klondike bar (and winning with the confetti raining down... yikes is that ever awful).<br /><br />Wrigley's Juicy Fruit Gum is addicting.  If it wasn't for the poor state of my teeth and my dentists highly recommended wishes to avoid sugary foods, I'd be chewing this stuff all the time.  Actually it hurts when I chew gum for several minutes at a time these days... so I probably wouldn't.  I guess the jingle is right- the taste is gonna move me all the way to the dentists office and a monthly 100-dollar bill.<br /><br />Anyway, this is probably my favorite gum flavor-wise.  My teeth may not like it, my dentist may not like it, but the sugar Gods above shine down with a smile whenever I chew it so at least I could appease somebody.

review/text: The gum in this packaging is much better than what you typically get out of the vending machines for some unknown reason. Flavor is approximately the same, however, in this format, the flavor tends to last longer and taste better as well as being easier to chew.<br /><br />Whatever the reason behind this, this is the format to purchase!

review/summary: resinous, sweet, intense
review/text: The flavor of cardamom is medicinal to some--well, it has been used for years to mask the bad taste of remedies. It is a resinous (piney) aromatic bitter-sweet spice, rather intense. The green papery pods are broken open, and the dark seeds inside can be pulled out and ground in a mortar for use in breads, cookies, curries, puddings, chai and the like. It is the spice of &quot;kheer&quot;--Indian rice pudding, where sometimes the whole green pods are thrown in. I use it in tea or even coffee, bruising the black seeds slightly with the pestle. It is also commonly used in pilau (pilaf) or biryani, that festive Indian rice and meat or vegetable cassarole. Scandinavian cooking uses this spice in many cookies and cakes. <p>If you aren't used to the flavor, it can be a bit startling--not sweet and spicey like cinnamon or nutmeg. The pods are a nuisance to process, but the volatile essential oils are so fugitive that it's better to put up with the job of extracting the seeds than to use ground cardamom that will just lose its scent. Rather like the difference between fresh grated nutmeg and powdered.

She appears to really be uplifted from drinking a cup each morning, I recommend this as a great starter tea for everyone, especially teenagers.

I can usually only get one cup out of flavorful tea out of a tea bag, but when you can purchase 20 bags/box so inexpensively, you can afford to just use a new tea bag for your cup.  The value has what has turned this tea into my go-to morning pick-me-up.

review/summary: Pretty good value
review/text: I love green tea and was hoping for a better pomegranate/cranberry flavor (as in more fruity I guess).  It really isn't very strong flavored but the aroma is intoxicating.  When I brew it up I can smell it from the next room and that scent really does add to the enjoyment of this tea.  I'm pretty sure I got it for under ten bucks for the 6 boxes of 20 bags.  It's a really good deal at that price or even for a few bucks more.<br /><br />If you are a tea drinker and can enjoy the not-as-strong green and white tea flavors then you could do worse than to try this product out for yourself.

I have tried plain sugar as well as various regular hard candies and sugar-free candies and they all work great!  Only complaint is that when it is turned on, it vibrates so badly that it makes the plastic shield shake and make an obnoxious noise.  I watched the infomercial and it even happened on there, so I guess it is a normal problem.

review/text: Followed the directions by letting the machine "warm up" then we only used flossing sugar (we bought online via Amazon for $19.95 for 3 flavors) in the machine and we instantly  had cotton candy forming. It made a decent amount for a serving. I noticed the sugar builds up quickly and after 3 sticks of cotton candy we had to wash the middle piece that holds the candy/sugar or else it was not going to work properly. The only negative thing my family noticed is there seem sot be "cotton" floating in the air while the machine is running. I did not notice it being right next to the machine but they were in the dinning room and could see the candy floating in tiny pieces through the house. Smells good & taste awesome. We did not attempt to use the hard candy. Only the flossing sugar.

You must break up any other candies (i.e., lifesavers, jolly ranchers, peppermints, etc.) & use only two max.  Machine's a lot of fun!  I will be purchasing more paper holders.

review/summary: EXCELLENT GINGER
review/text: I bought this ginger about three weeks ago and have been using it since.  It tastes very fresh and hot.  I drink it in water or tea  to prevent my muscles from getting sore from my weight lifting.  Taking ginger, I am able to exercise more often without soreness.  As well, I generally enjoy genger in my tea because it's tasty.

review/summary: My favorite sea salt
review/text: La Baleine is excellent sea salt for a good value. I like the coarse texture because I do use a grinder for the table and I have not had a problem with using large crystals when seasoning while cooking.<br /><br />One thing you should be aware of is that the picture is slightly misleading. My package did not contain the four different package types that are displayed, but instead four canisters. I had suspected this would be the case because the item description has four units of the same size and I like the canisters, but if you were looking for a bag or box of salt, this might not be the right product for you. The canisters are very sturdy and convenient. The lid is resealable and I keep one out by my stove at all times.<br /><br />Overall, this package is a great value. This is the second time I have purchased La Baleine coarse salt and I am extremely pleased with the taste.

review/text: Hello, I haven't tasted this product but am considering purchasing and it was very difficult to find the ingredients anywhere on the web as they are not on the manufacturer's website or this Amazon webpage.  You would think when someone is charging more for their product because of the supposedly higher quality expensive ingredients, they would tell you what you are paying for.  Plus many people have allergies and want to know what is in something before they purchase it.  I do realize there are fools out there that couldn't care less if they are ingesting poison, but we do!  : )<br /><br />SKU: 070795035648<br />Weight: 15 oz<br />Manufacturer:<br /><br />Gluten Free Cafe<br />Description:<br /><br />Great taste and good nutrition - Gluten Free Cafe Soups are the first and only line of gluten free soups fortified with vitamins, minerals, and prebiotics.<br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Water, portobello mushrooms, heavy cream (milk), rice flour, mushroom concentrate (mushrooms, soy sauce [soybeans, maltodextrin], mushroom powder, butter [cream, lactic acid], molasses, yeast extract, potato flour, natural flavors), enriched rice flour (contains calcium phosphate, niacinamide, iron [ferric orthophosphate], riboflavin, thiamine mononitrate, folic acid, vitamin D3), sea salt, rice starch, inulin, natural flavors (includes autolyzed yeast extract), expeller pressed canola oil, onion powder, spices.<br /><br />CONTAINS MILK & SOY

review/summary: Perfect subsitute for your GF family
review/text: I'm new to the gluten free diet, and the hardest thing for me was trying to find substitute products for my favorite recipes, especially the comfort food casserols.  This was perfect.<br /><br />The flavor of this soup is richer than Campbells Cream of Mushroom - so on flavor alone making the switch was a huge bonus.  I've tried the other (more expensive) gluten free cream of mushroom soups and I'd say I like them equally so this won out on price.<br /><br />If you are making the switch from Campbells and using it in a recipe, you'll want to use less liquid or add a thickener because its less condensed.

review/summary: Get what you pay for, and I enjoy it
review/text: I've been drinking green tea religiously for the past 2 years. I drink about 5 cups a day, and have tried quite a few different ones for decent periods (ranging from Bigelow, to Twinings, to more expensive teas). I originally started drinking it purely for the health benefits, but the flavor grew on me quickly and I sought to try `better tasting/higher quality' tea.<br /><br />I started with these packs of Lipton, and after trying several different teas I ended up coming back to it. In my experiences, while there certainly are very distinct differences in flavor between all the different teas, they all tend to grow on you over time. It gets really tough to judge preferences between them, and at the end it's extremely subjective which one you may like best.<br /><br />That said, flavor-wise this green tea might not be my favorite. I suppose it would be best described as tasting `less green' than more expensive teas, or slightly watered down/mild. But, considering the price I can't fairly list that as a con.<br /><br />At the end of the day for what I desire out of it, it's perfect for me.<br /><br />It has the health benefits, it has easy/convenient (and recyclable!) packaging, tastes good, and is among the lowest price per tea bag of any other teas. So for me, it's 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, another reviewer seemed to think Amazon had it overpriced, but his math is definitely off. Per tea bag, as long as you have free shipping and no taxes Amazon definitely has the cheapest price (and by a good margin) I've found between Walmart, Stop and Shop, tea stores, Lipton website, etc (as long as you're buying the 6-pack).

review/summary: Green tea on a budget
review/text: Despite the Lipton brand, Lipton's Green Tea tastes more like a product that a seasoned green tea drinker might enjoy, rather than a casual drinker of mass produced tea. The flavor of this green tea might turn-off a lot of casual tea drinkers who expect green tea to taste like something you might find in most bottled ice tea (and no it does not taste like Lipton's bottled Green Tea). As a hot tea green tea Lipton Green Tea has a smoky and bitter taste that might not appeal to a mass consumer green tea market, however as an iced tea the taste redeems itself as it mellows out.<br /><br />I would recommend this brand of green tea to folks who like smoky and bitter green tea. When hot the tea has a smoky aspect that is very apparent. As an iced tea you have a softer smoky taste.<br /><br />The price is actually pretty good as green tea is pretty expensive. Before investing in an Amazon 6-pack you might want to buy a single box or find someone who drinks this brand of tea to sample it.

review/summary: To use the word 'Mild' is putting it Mildly
review/text: Please start to read this review with the knowledge that I enjoy strong flavors.  I deliberately seek the strong aquatic notes in authentic green tea, the robust nuttiness in a well-roasted coffee, and for black tea, there is a wonderful floral, perfumey quality that is mandatory for me.  It's not the added scents of flavored teas that I'm talking about, but just the natural heavenly aroma, the rich, heady, concentrated impact of well picked and well preserved leaves.<br />Unfortunately, in it's quest for mildness, Dilmah English Afternoon Tea loses that wonderful aroma of it's earlier-in-the-day cousins, English Breakfast Tea and Irish Breakfast Tea.<br />Make no mistake, this is indeed a quality tea product, as are all Dilmah items.  The fact that the tea is ethically grown makes the flavor all that more palatable, but the aroma is an essential part of the tea experience for yours truly, and that aroma has been made a whisper not a roar, in the English Afternoon variety.  Dilmah English Afternoon remains a good basic tea for drinking straight, but the dollop of sweetened condensed milk that I normally use to round out my cup is also just a bit too much for this delicate brew.<br />With that said - this might just be the perfect thing for those who seek the mild side of life.

review/text: I initially got the Dilmah sample pack as an Amazon lightning deal. This was my favorite of the bunch. It's very pleasant and easy to drink. It never gets bitter, even when I forget to remove the teabag. That's why I ordered the 6-pack of this flavor after trying the sample pack. I drink a lot of tea, bagged and loose. When I want convenience, comfort, and caffeine, this is the tea I reach for.<br /><br />I also like Dilmah's business philosophy. They seem to be a very ethical company and to care for their workers well, so I feel like I'm getting a cup of good karma in addition to good tea.

And there may be other health benefits as well.  (There's a good article in Wikipedia.)<br /><br />Oh, and Ice Cubes happen to taste great:-)

review/summary: A little pricy but the best gum around... now
review/text: This is the best gum I've found since Hersey discontinued their Koolerz brand several years ago. (This stuff is also made by Hersey).<br /><br />Both the Spearmint and Peppermint flavors have a nicely combined minty sweetness that lingers for quite a while. The texture stays "chewably soft" for even longer. Another thing I really like about this gum, unlink others I've tried, is it doesn't stick to my fillings or crowns and I don't wind up with little pieces between my teeth.<br /><br />The only problem is the investment to get your first sample. If you can find it in a store, it's not everywhere, individual packs can be expensive. It can be less, per piece, here but multiple packs is a bit if a gamble if you've never tried it.<br /><br />It's great gum and you will probably like it if you like gum. I was lucky and sat next to a guy in a plane who offered me some. And, if you should run into me, ask for some because I'll be having some on hand from now on.<br /><br />Please feel free to let Amazon and me know whether this was helpful to you or not, since it helps me improve my reviews.

review/summary: Good Flavor
review/text: What's to be said? It's a personal taste question. Add this to steal cut oats oatmeal and enjoy. Alternatively add the date version. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2EK">Alwadi Al Akhdar Date Molasses, 24.75-Ounce plastic jar (Pack of 3)</a> The date molasses has a slightly stronger flavor than the grape, but both are less strong than sugar molasses and have to be better for you. Try one or both. Nix sugar and get some real flavor.<br /><br />UPDATE 2012<br />Since the date molasses version of this product changed from a pure date base to having sugar added, check the ingredients label of the product you receive to ensure it's strictly grape based. Concentrated grape juice with citric acid isn't an issue, but adding sugar would be unwanted.

review/summary: Unique flavor...
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect with 'grape' molasses but it is actually quite delicious and tastes like sweet raisin syrup with just a subtle hint of tartness. This was good in my coffee as a sweetener and I'm going to make my own Yoshida sauce and Worcestershire sauce with this flavor of molasses as I think it would be perfect for that.

review/summary: Good brand of food
review/text: I have now tried both the Ocean Fish and Tuna and the Duck and Chicken variety of this food.  My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.  (In case you are wondering, it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea/1.5 pea size potato? bits per 1/4 to 1/2 can.)

review/text: I love the Coconut version of this bar and wanted to try a new flavor.  The 15 bars came in a household plastic bag (let's not even get started on the unprofessional packaging for such a pricy product)...  The bag was all slimy from the inside, because one of the bars must have leaked.  I had to wash off everything to be able to carry them with me.  The bar itself doesn't taste that good, is very gooey and sticks to your teeth.  Very disappointed.  Won't order this one again.

review/summary: great trick and delicious for ribs or brisket.
review/text: I've lived in apartments with no outdoor space for years-- but can always get nicely smoked foods by using these bags.  True, your entire home will smell like wood smoke, but not such a bad thing (you can always undercook a bit, take the meat out and finish it outside the bag if you don't want a strong smell to linger).  The times for cooking and the recipes included on the inside are right on target every time, you really can't go wrong.  Makes wonderful brisket-- I let it cool after cooking, slice it, and then add sauce and reheat.  My friends and I agree that the poultry/fish bags aren't quite as good.<br /><br />The first I tried was a similar import from William's Foods, but they no longer carry these.  Wish I could get them locally, but this works!

review/summary: EASY TO USE GREAT SMOKEY FLAVOR!!!
review/text: I have been using these smoker bags for several years. the first time I used them I bought them from my local Cub foods grocery store. i however now just order them on line since I can get them year around. I have used them on the grill, but mostly inside in the oven. I use them mainly for smoking ribs and turkey legs. They always come out perfect. Everyone compliments me on the flavor and tenderness of the meat. I usually finish them up on the gas grill with barbeque sauce for that perfct taste. I have given these away to friends nd family and they are now using them. I would be really surprised if anyone tried them and didn't like them.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I used a smoker bag to make incredible pulled pork. I used a 6 lb pork shoulder and seasoned it. Placed in the smoker bag at 225. I put mine in the oven at midnight and let it slow roast till 7 am. I was afraid at this low heat it would not get smokey enough but it was perfect. I pulled the pork apart in the juices from the bag and it was as good as any pulled pork I've had.

review/summary: Excellent!!
review/text: To the person who rated this low to due getting just 1 bag...read what you order. Very unfair to rate a product 1 star due to your own error.<br />The bags are great!! So far I've only tried the alder one which gives a lighter taste than the mesquite.<br />*Read the instructions WELL on the INside of the cardboard*<br />I bought a 4-pack of rainbow trout from [...] and rubbed kosher salt inside the fish a couple of hours before cooking. Preheated oven to 475F, placed 1 large cubed zucchini and the 4 fish inside the bag, folded closed and placed on a low rack. Lowered temp to 375F after 15 min and continued for another 25-30 min (3 lbs of fish) = perfection! My kids were crazy about eating "fish tummy" and this couldn't have been any easier to cook or easier to clean up.<br />A very light smoke lingered around the kitchen, but nothing that I'd need to even open the windows for. If the smell is a problem, use your bbq (instructions include oven, coal or gas grill).<br />Too bad the price is such a rip off...these are available for under a buck in Finland.

review/summary: Smoked the house more than the food
review/text: I bought this item based on such good reviews. I thought I would do some ribs in the stove using a smoker bag instead going out in the cold to use the barbeque grill, but what a mistake. I followed the directions exactly and all I got was a smoky house and smoky clothes. The ribs had a weird and faint wood taste not smoky like you get on the grill. YUCK! The ribs were the worst I ever tasted. I usually don't do reviews unless I feel it's necessary and this is one of those times. I really expected to have good results. I give this one TWO THUMBS DOWN.

My german shepherd is usually picky over food but he loves Avoderm. I highly recommend this food. Packaging and expiration date were fine and I will definitely order from amazon instead of buying in a pet store. The price is way cheaper!

review/text: My 4 month old American Eskimo started eating this brand about two weeks ago and in the last several days I've noticed her stool very loose and smelly. Not only that, she farts! She does like the food. I give her 1/4 cup in a cloth pouch she likes to eat out of instead of a bowl. On occasion, I've mixed some of the Avoderm canned food with her dry kibble. I'm a little disappointed with the gas and loose stool. Before Avoderm, she didn't care for Iams Puppy, Wellness SuperMix Puppy, or Halo Spot Puppy... she would eventually eat those when she was starving but the Avoderm she likes! When she finishes this 4.4 lb bag, I'm going to start her on a different brand that might be better for her to digest. Or maybe her stomach will adjust??
