review/summary: Good product, does what it's supposed to
review/text: It does what it's supposed to. I have a few grumbles, however.<br />First, of the 4 I bought, on 2 the caps did not close very well, and it would tend to pop open. But it's okay when you pop it in for brewing.<br />Second, it does not stand on its own on the counter, so you have to hold it while you are filling it - it would be nice to be able to just have it stand on its own.<br />Third, if the coffee ground is too fine, such as espresso grounds, then the filter plugs and does not work at all.<br />Fourth, the mini well at the bottom does not clean easily, and the grounds tend to stick in there.

review/summary: Best reusable filter for K-Cup yet!
review/text: I have the Keurig My K-Cup and found it to be annoying to have to pull out the insert to use it after I use an actual k-cup.  This eliminates that and I've found it to make a better cup of coffee as well.  It's a nice one piece design so no messing with the 3 pieces like the My K-cup.  Works great.

review/summary: Much better than "My K Cup"
review/text: Great Coffee taste with all the flavors of fresh ground coffee and a French Press with out the mess.  Solofill Cup is almost idiot proof.  If you can read and follow directions you will have no problem with this.  My K Cup works fine, but the Solofill Cup works better.  Easier to use, better flow, more of the flavors of fresh ground coffee come through.  If you use the right grind, only fill to the fill line, make sure the gasket is clean and snap the lid shut it will work right every time.  Added bonus, when I am in a hurry and snap a factory K Cup in, I don't have to change the filter holder.  Best $15.00 spent in awhile.  Get to use local custom blend fresh whole bean coffee that tastes as good as French Press.  My K Cup coffee always lacked some of the flavor, Solofill Cup does not.

review/summary: FINALLY
review/text: Finally!! I love my Keurig, and I don't mind buying the k-cups. What does bother me is the limited availability of flavored decaf coffees. I am a coffee addict and could drink it all day if it didn't keep me up all night. I have tried every other do it yourself k cup product out there and they all stink! This product actually works. It brews a decent cup of coffee,  not watered down and not a single ground of coffee in the cup. This product is worth the money! Thinking about buying a second!

review/summary: very functional but too flimsy to last
review/text: Got 3 of these to salve my recycle conscience and save on cost. I have the smallest of the Keurigs and drink 2 cups a day, so I figured I could keep 2 clean. The good news is that size is perfect, fits beautifully and brew is excellent (just using my adc ground Green Mtn coffee). They work great and are 5 star for that. However, they are made in china of all plastic, including the important hinge top that is the one moving part. I am super careful with this, but it's just plastic, rather flimsy, and there's no way it's going to last repeated openings, which of course are necessary for both filling and cleaning. This would not be a killer if they weren't so relatively expensive. I'm sure it can't have cost the producers even a dollar for these. Either upgrade quality or downgrade price!

review/summary: I Can't Understand the negative reviews
review/text: I bought two of these, and have been using them for a couple weeks now.  They are well built, they seal nicely, and they work great.  I've been testing them out on various teas - loose chamomile, green tea, I even took some Tazo out of the tea bags and tried it in the Solofill - all tests passed with flying colors.  There isn't much documentation out there for using a Keurig as a tea brewer from loose, but I am extremely pleased withe the results so far - it will press tea from too weak to overly strong depending on grind and amount.  I ground some coffee and tried it in the solo - it was great.  The pressed coffee using Solofill and Keurig tastes superior to the drip-brewed coffee in our Melitta or Krups coffee maker.  A coarser grind on teas and coffees seems to work better, on fine grind the water has trouble pressing through the medium.<br /><br />Cleaning them is quite easy, as long as you don't wait for the grounds to dry overnight inside the Solofill.

review/summary: Perfumy disappointment
review/text: ***<br /><br />Tazo's Earl Grey Black Tea is very perfumy. I am used to drinking super-premium tea that have the real bergamot added, not the essence. So this tea tasted to me like regular black tea with a very, very strong bergamot-like flavor. I definitely did not care for it, although I love Earl Grey teas in general. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a more aromatic version of the Earl's traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot"; therein lies the problem---a little too perfumy and scented for me. On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as "floral, lavender, fragrant, spicy, lemon". Tazo describes the aroma as "citrus, lavender, light smoke".  You may like it; apparently the other reviewers so far do, but it is not for me at all.<br /><br />Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.<br /><br />The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence. Note that Earl Grey does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />***

review/summary: Earl Grey Kicked Up A Notch
review/text: First of all let me say that this is what Black Tea is suppose to TASTE like. As soon as I took a sip of this tea earlier today, I knew that this is one of Tazo's finest tea. I'm not going to say that I've tasted many Earl Grey teas, because the only other Earl Grey Tea I've tasted is Twinings. But this tea in my opinion added a twist that was needed for Earl Grey Tea. Don't get me wrong Earl Grey Tea is fine the way it is, but the scented citrus bergamot added by Tazo makes a difference.<br /><br />I would enjoy drinking the Tea straight up with some sugar, but I like to add a little bit of milk to the tea because I'm used to adding Milk to Black Teas.<br /><br />I recommend this Tea to anyone that is willing to try something new or enjoy Earl Grey with the Tazo Twist.

review/summary: Tasty, sprightly and delicious!
review/text: Tazo shows considerable expertise in the blending of this top quality tea. The black teas utilized are, as the box states, "the worlds most sought after teas from the high-elevation gardens of Nuwara Eliya, Uva and Dimbula in Sri Lanka and Assam in northeast India." These sumptuous black teas provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend.<br /><br />The fragrance of Tazo Earl Grey is powerfully floral, in particular lavender, citrus, and the woodsy-malt scent of premium black tea. The flavor of this splendid potion is rich and perfumed. The addition of cream creates a lush sensual brew. A topnotch tea blend!<br /><br />Earl Grey is considered to be the second most popular tea in the world. Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas, usually Chinese and Indian teas, sometimes with a smoky flavor, and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot. Earl Grey tea has an interesting history. Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men. Twinings and Jacksons of Piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea.

review/summary: Robust Earl Grey
review/text: Of all the Earl Grey's I've tried, this and Rishi's version are the most robust.  If you like the distinctive flavor of bergamont, but wish it were more pronounced than in the conventional blend, and your not opposed to some extra tannins, then this or Rishi are your Earl Greys of choice.  Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my favorite is Bigelow's. My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. However, I have to knock Revolution by trying cut costs by not including a string with their tea bags. If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont. I think it includes grapefruit flavoring (just my perception). Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves.

review/summary: Great Green Tea Experience, Tazo's Best
review/text: *****<br /><br />Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent "natural flavors" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!<br /><br />The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these "natural flavors" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor." This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as "grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey". Tazo describes the aroma as "vegetative, popcorn".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: China Green TIps, not really.
review/text: I'm a green tea lover and enjoy Tazo China Green Tips when traveling as its one of the only popular green teas that you can depend on in an airport or mall. However the tea sold as China Green Tips on Amazon or in food shops is not the same tea. Or rather, if you think stale bread crumbs are the same as fresh bread then you must think like the managers of Tazo.  Tea like coffee is about all about freshness. The China Green Tips Tazo supplies to Starbucks is fresh whole leaves, the tea in these bags is stale crumbs and a real dissapointment.<br /><br />I travel a lot and get to enjoy really good green teas in Asia. Americans are still learning about green tea and judging from what is available at both super market and specialty shops, they aren't given a chance to experience how really good green tea can be. Rather they are told that green is good for you and if you just flavor it right, it should be drinkable. There are shops through out America with amazing teas from Taiwan, great carefully packaged teas in Korean and Japanese groceries, but very little of this gets past the corporate membrane. The fact that we are so tuned into the art of coffee but put up with green dust for tea is a mystery.

review/text: This is a classic green tea that brews up to a pale amber liquor with a fine grassy scent. Savor this tea for a delicate and elusive experience. The taste is barley, sweet hay and the faintest herbal taste. The aftertaste is very mild and fresh.<br /><br />Green tea is touted for its health benefits--not just antioxidants but also because it is supposed to help you lose weight!! Green tea averages about 10-30 mg of caffeine as opposed to 90 mg in a cup of coffee. Tazo does not put how much caffeine is in their tea on the box.

review/text: ****<br /><br />Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas."

Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.<br /><br />The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea".

review/summary: India's Original Spiced Milk Tea.
review/text: In many languages around the world, "chai" simply means "tea." In India, however, the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea.<br /><br />Chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region, although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea, rich milk, various spices and a sweetner. The spices most commonly used are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper; Tazo's very peppery Chai adds rooibos, vanilla, star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe.<br /><br />You should always have this tea with real sugar, even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener, because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices. And if you like your store-bought Chai, maybe you'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices, too! Namaste ...

The tastes was good, it gave me a calming feeling, I felt mentally sharp, and could focus. However, the bad news is that 12 hours later, I could not sleep at night! I watched the clock tick all night long. After two days of this, I suspected the tea (as the only thing different in my routine). Since I have a personal and family history of hypertension (although under control by diet, medication, and exercise), I checked by BP that morning when I could not sleep: 148/98 and a pulse of 98! Something in that tea (I suspect) is interacting with my system. I don't ever want to go through this before., Has anyone else experienced this???

review/summary: Quality food without the unnecessary additives
review/text: Cats are carnivores.  If you check out the ingredients list for many of the common brands you find at the grocery store, you'll see the first couple of ingredients are *not* meat, but rather grains.  As well, the meat typically is made up of by-products, which are not suitable for human consumption.  Yes,  I know, we're not going to be consuming our feline companion's food, but the reality is with cats and their funky digestive tract issues, their food should not contain grain or meat by-products, plain and simple.<br /><br />There are a number of outstanding grain-free cat foods out there, but this one in particular our cats eat happily.  One of our cats was significantly overweight, and with NOW recommended by our veterinarian , my fiancee gave it a try. At the time he began this food, we were actually living on opposite coasts and I hadn't seen the cats in roughly 8 months given my travels.  When I saw our cat after that absence, I was shocked to see how slimmed down he was and how healthy he had become.  Using this food, in combination with that feeding bowl in which the cats have to stick their paws into to retrieve the food (looks like a flying saucer) has been the key to success!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this product is not widely stocked at pet care places in our area, but I am delighted that Amazon carries it.  I've been able to order it, trouble-free, and the food arrives fresh and ready to be consumed.  I highly recommend this brand and encourage you to read the ingredient labels on anything you feed your pet-companions.

The ingredients are impressive, however, as I slowly moved them over from their traditional Purina One to this product, both of them developed a severe case of the runs.  So, I portioned them back to a larger portion of the Purina One thinking they needed more time to adjust to this new food, however I can't seem to get them back to normal.  So, I have 95% of this bag and am not currently feeding them any of it.  I also had to get some remedy for the diahrrea, which is taking time to kick in.<br /><br />As I mentioned, they seemed to love the taste, but it has been a big problem for their digestive systems.

review/summary: Great for older cat with sensitive skin
review/text: About a year ago, my 12-year-old cat developed an itchy rash on her forehead.  The vet ruled out more serious health issues, and speculated that it was an allergic reaction or food sensitivity.  And so began a year of cat food experiments...<br /><br />We tried a range of grain-free foods with various protein sources.  Some didn't help the skin; some she didn't like. The local pet food store suggested this.  The big selling point was that it doesn't have any "meals"-- no "chicken meal" or "fish meal" or "turkey byproduct" or whatever.  She has been eating this for the past 6 months or so, and her skin has cleared up remarkably.  And the fact that she taps on my cheek until I wake up and feed her in the morning suggests that it is also quite delicious.<br /><br />It is expensive, but it has helped her skin issues enough that it's been worth it.  (A trip to the vet costs quite a bit more!)  If you have an older cat that seems to have developed a food sensitivity, this is definitely a good option to try.

review/summary: Outstanding food, grain free
review/text: As any cat owner will tell you, cat digestive systems are a royal challenge.  Now! Dry Cat Food is a unique product that doesn't have any fillers, no grain at all, and the meat that is used contains no by-products.  Essentially, it's human-grade.<br /><br />Cat's are carnivores, plain and simple.  And this food addresses that beautifully.<br /><br />This particular formula, for senior and overweight cats, has made a huge difference in the quality of our cat's health.  My cats love the taste, never turn their nose up from this product, and my formerly over-weight cat is now looking terrific, and both he and his brother are very healthy - healthy coat, bright eyes, etc.<br /><br />Unfortunately this product is not sold every where (yet)but I am grateful I can get it here on Amazon!  I highly recommend this brand.

review/summary: Great for cat with Irritable Bowel Syndrome
review/text: I've purchased the Now! Grain free (10 lbs) turkey with duck & salmon dry cat food 3 times now over the past 4 months.  Wanted to see how our cat with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) would do on it.  He loves it, and will chow it down to the point where he would get fat, if we let him.  Have to portion it out to him thru the day.  Other cat loves it, too, and she no longer vomits on a regular basis.  Definitely a good quality product which is sold at our veterinarian's office, but I buy it online with Amazon for better price. Sidenote:  we're gradually starting to reduce the amount of budesonide medicine given to our cat with IBS problem to eventually see how he does without the medicine & if he's okay just being on Now! grain free food.

The phosphorous level is 0.65% dry matter, considered to be on the low but acceptable. The protein(30%) quality is high, grain free and acceptable fat(18%) level.

He eats less compared to the grain stuff, and he seems satisfied for longer. We haven't switched for 3 years. When our cat lost a few of his teeth, we tried a soft food, but he preferred this softened with water to canned food, even.<br /><br />The side benefit was the smell from his litterbox dropped dramatically compared to the brands we tried previously.

review/summary: wonderful tea!
review/text: There has been a lot of upheaval in my life, lately, so you know that I have needed a tea called "Calm."  This particular tea, by Tazo, has great ingredients (chamomile blossoms, hibiscus flowers, spearmint leaves, rose petals, blackberry leaves, peppermint leaves, safflower, lemon balm, lemon grass and natural flavorings).  I can definitely see why this is supposed to calm you down.  Chamomile has calming properties that soothe me into feeling more at peace (just not so much that it feels like I have been induced).  I could definitely taste the rose petals and most of the other ingredients I mentioned above.  I am so glad that some products (like tea), especially from Tazo, have remained untampered with and are still made with ingredients we can easily pronounce and are derived from nature.  I highly reccomend this tea when you are feeling stressed, need a little "tea escape"  or for any reason at all, really.

review/summary: The best tea I've ever had
review/text: I am a coffee drinker. I don't drink tea. However, I've tried various teas because I enjoy switching to tea when I'm not in the mood to caffeine. I tried Green Tea's but they actually made me very sick. I must have an adverse reaction to the strong chemicals in Green Tea, because I cannot stomach it in the morning. When I drink it, I get a headache and a strong stomach ache that lasts for about 5 hours. Green tea = toxic effect. Now, I could build up a tolerance to Green Tea, but I'd much rather not endure that much sickness. Green Tea also tastes awful in my opinion.<br /><br />By accident I purchased this tea from Walmart, where it is always sold out, because it seems to be the most popular tea at the local Walmart I go to. When I first tried this tea I was hooked. It has a sweet fragrant aroma, but not an overpowering fragrance. I don't like bitter teas, and this isn't bitter. It is a very nice flavor that I cannot describe. However, it makes the best hot or cold tea. My G/F who is not a tea drinker opened a bottle of ICED tea I made with this "Calm" tea. She said it was the best iced tea she had ever drank. She immediately wanted to buy more of this tea so we could make dozens of bottles of iced tea. For many months we drank only the "Calm" iced tea instead of regular water, because it gives the water such a soothing aroma and sweet taste. Only 1 tea bag per 2 liters of water is required and the water gets a very gentle aromatic flavor that is the best iced tea I've ever had.<br /><br />I really love this tea. The only thing it could use more of is some licorice, because I prefer a sweeter taste. But you can put a small spoon of sugar in this and it is the most enjoyable sweet treat. Yes, I know I'm not a real hardcore tea enthusiast, and maybe I shouldn't be writing any reviews on tea, but I just wanted to compliment this tea and I hope it never goes away!

review/summary: Nice Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Calm Herbal Infusion is a nice chamomile tea. I taste the chamomile and some flavorings, and they are not unpleasant, just hard to pin down as to what they are besides the chamomile. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.<br /><br />The ingredients in Calm are: chamomile flowers, hibiscus flowers, spearmint, lemongrass, rose petals, blackberry leaves, safflowers, peppermint, sarsaparilla, lemon balm, licorice and natural flavors. It is caffeine-free!<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a soothing blend of chamomile blossoms and other relaxing herbs." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Calm as "creamy, floral, minty, toasty, sweet, honey-like. As the name gently implies, Tazo Calm has a lovely floral bouquet with an apple-like flavor and distinct toasty notes.  Naturally sweet in a nice light way, with a smooth finish". Tazo describes the aroma as "minty, hay like, rose". I don't taste all of these various flavors, but I do taste the chamomile, and it is fine, not overwhelming or as artificial tasting as several of the other Tazo teas I've sampled.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Calm gets only four stars.<br />****

review/text: This is a higher quality chamomile tea than, say, Celestial Seasonings but is NOT the one they sell at Starbucks.  Beware.  This is a dried, chopped tea with a different recipe and different amounts of ingredients than the same label at a Starbucks, and the tea is in "filterbags."  Just look at the ingredient list to see.  I don't know why Tazo sells this; it's confusing and piggybacks on the reputation that the beautiful whole leaf teas with their intense flavor have.  If you want the ones from Starbucks, order Tazo "full leaf" teas which are something like a dime more per bag; well worth it.

review/text: I am only giving this tea 5 stars because it delivers.  After steeping the tea bag in warm water for 5 minutes, within moments of nursing on the tea, you do begin to feel a sense of calm.  If you are a swimmer, and panicky in the water, like myself, this helps out a lot.  Do note, this tea can be habit-forming and you'll need more of it after a while to reach the same effect.  Surprisingly you do not need a prescription for this stuff.  NB, this is not the same tea you get at Starbucks, which has fuller leaves and hibiscus flowers inside, and delivers a stronger punch.

review/summary: Peaceful Thoughts...
review/text: "A single cup of Tazo Calm has been known to have the same effect as sitting for 45 minutes in a mountain meadow on a sunny day with your shoes off." ~tea packet<br /><br />Drinking this particular tea blend almost begs for 32 ounces of water. You can brew this tea in your coffee maker by letting the water drip slowly onto the tea that is sitting in a coffee filter or you can use the infuser that comes with this kit.<br /><br />This tea has a magical, almost golden sparkle of brass. The ingredients in this herbal blend are almost romantic. How often do you drink a tea with "rose petals" in the blend?<br /><br />Ingredients: Chamomile flowers, hibiscus flowers, spearmint, lemongrass, rose petals, blackberry leaves, safflowers, peppermint, sarsaparilla, lemon balm, licorice, and other natural flavors.<br /><br />Chamomile is known for its soothing properties and after drinking this tea I have vivid dreams and my sleep is deep and calm and I wake up refreshed. Tazo Calm Herbal Infusion will allow your body to relax into sleep and can be especially calming after yoga, before bed, or when writing peaceful thoughts in your journal.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: A Life Saver
review/text: As the previous reviewer suggests - drink for the caffeine.  If you're among the flock of rare non-coffee drinking birds - it's a good idea to keep a few bags of Tazo Awake in the glove compartment.  Then, of course, you can always go to your local Starbucks to get some.  Starbucks didn't always own Tazo. They bought out what began as a very clever enterprise, which, since the corporate takeover, has stagnated. The best popular brand black tea readily available.  However, Borneo Rainforest Organic Black Tea is the purest and tastiest bagged black tea I have found, vastly superior to Tazo, imported from Malaysia by Borneotea Company, available on the net. Also, Amazon Herb Company's Rainforest Treasure Tea keeps you up as effectively (though not nearly as inexpensively) without the caffeine.

review/summary: caution if you're caffeine sensitive
review/text: I drink a lot of tea and I don't drink coffee, the main reason being I am apparently one of those wussy types who are highly sensitive to caffeine. I had a grande size Awake this afternoon at Starbucks and several hours later I am still recovering. I am no longer nauseous and shaky but I am still hyper. As tea taste goes I like it--it's neither better nor worse than average--but for someone like me (and yes, I realize this is not the norm for most people) it is too caffeinated. I thought I'd put this out there for anyone else who might experience the same kind of jolt since it isn't really a good feeling. I will keep Awake in mind though if I ever find that I need to build a house in 24 hours or complete a full year of graduate work in a week.

As Tazo awake, doesn't. It some how is my perfect black tea. Whatever they put in it, it works and I love it. I have yet to taste a black tea like this one. I also don't see the caffine increase. Seems like a normal black tea, but I drink coffee as well and might be used to the level? I get it at starbucks and make it at home.

review/summary: English Breakfast Style - High Quality Tea
review/text: "There are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea." -Henry James, Portrait of a Lady<br /><br />This "English Breakfast" style tea is quite satisfying and has a rich flavor that is quite delicious.<br /><br />I'd like to say that their teas are best steeped for an extra 5-10 minutes to draw out all the delicious flavors. You can use a teapot or a coffee maker to make tea. Simply put the tea in a coffee filter or the tea bags in the coffee pot, then allow the boiling water to drip over the tea leaves.<br /><br />The sensual blend of exotic spices, teas and herbs used in their teas include a mixture of the following: Black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, Rooibos, Gingerroot, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflowers, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise and red poppy flowers.<br /><br />This is a blend of black teas, but all their teas are worth trying. Passion and Chai are also favorites.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I like black tea and have tried many kinds, but I find Tazo's Awake to be awful.  Starbuck's serves it and I think it's very bitter and have ended up tossing it.  I've tried it a few times hoping that maybe something went wrong the first time.  No, it's just a poor tasting tea.  Not sure about Tazo's other teas. I suggest trying Tetley, Red Rose, or Stash's English Breakfast for good black tea.

review/summary: FUN!!!
review/text: I originally got this for my 2 cats for basic function as a cat scratcher.  The moment I introduced it to them they had a blast with it. Climbing on it, hiding behind it, trying desperately to get that toy out if it.  They stick their paws in it and then their heads, when that doesn't work they try on the other side, then go back again. They chase each other around it and fight over it. It lasted nearly a year until when they were playing tag, one cat was perched on top of it in wait, the other came pounding toward her, took a flying leap on top of it and completely crushed it, scaring both cats enough to jump 10 feet. I laughed for hours.  This item is not only functional but I found it provides hours of entertainment for cat and human alike.

review/summary: Could be Better
review/text: I give the Kong Incline Cat Scratcher two stars because our four kitties do like the incline and the scratching pad.  However, the overall unit is lightweight and flimsy.  The toy in the base intrigued them but unfortunately it's not a furry mouse as shown in the picture, but instead is (was) just a paper pom-pom.  Our smallest kitty had the toy in shreds by the end of the second day.  The base of the Kong scratcher is cardboard and the unit moves at the slightest touch, so you need to add extra weight in order to use it.  We bought the Bergan Turbo Cat Scratcher at the same time, and I'd recommend it over the Kong.  The Bergan model has a similar scratching mat and a heavy plastic base that stays in place.  And our kitties love pushing the ball around the track on the Bergan.  Overall, at around $12.00, the Bergan is more expensive but promises to last much longer.<br /><br />Update on 9/07/10:  Be aware that the refills that Amazon sells to accompany this Kong cat scratcher are too big for the base.  The only way to use them is to cut them down, which is a pretty messy process.  Meanwhile, our Bergan is still going strong.  (Their refills do fit their base.)

review/summary: Cat Scratch Fever!!
review/text: I opened up the cat scratcher, spread a little nip on and my cat went to town on it. He barely gave me a chance to set it up. He has used incline scratchers before so this was something he was familiar with.<br /><br />I would recommend trying to weigh down the scratcher if your cat is over 7 lbs. I just stuck a little 10lb weight inside the little hole in the back. They are more apt to use the scratcher if it doesn't move around on them while they are scratching away.<br /><br />I bought this online because the price was so much better. I bought the incline scratcher and 2 packages of refills for what it would have cost for just the incline scratcher at a local pet store.<br /><br />If you're cat doesn't take to it you can't really blame the scratcher. Cats are persnickety creatures. My cat loves the incline scratcher but will not go near the pole with the rope for scratching.<br /><br />The cat is happy, I'm happy and my furniture is spared.

review/summary: Servicable...
review/text: My cat prefers incline scratchers and will definitely still go for carpets and chairs if I don't have an alternate close by so this seemed to fill the bill (at first) at a good price.  However, I second many of the other reviewers. .. It is light weight so, as someone else suggested, I put a few weights inside to stablize it.  My puss IMMEDIATELY pulled out the suspended paper ball (NOT a little mouse toy as pictured) and IMMEDIATELY shredded it...so much for that aspect.  I also used transparent packing tape to reinforce the whole thing since it seemed to be tearing slightly at the folds from heavy use (the good thing).<br /><br />IF you can order this so that the shipping is free, and if you just want another scratcher to place around the house to keep your puss off furniture scratching..this is a good price vs retail (Target for instance) for this kind of thing.  Its the least ugly of the products that provide unobtrusive scratch pads...I keep searching around  for an alternate that looks a bit better before I'd buy it again though.  Just quite flimsy ...so there's nothing special about getting this through Amazon (the price IS a bit better but not that much)..so sorry about that though.  I was quite hopeful this was 'the one'...for cheap, serviceable, and least ugly.  Close but not a winner.

review/text: Some cats love this, some don't but at this price it is worth trying if you need a scratcher and have never tried the inclined ramp style.  My cats rejected this.  My sister's cats had rejected a floor model scratcher (for cats to stand on and scratch).  So we decided to try a swap and, lol, her cats LOVE this product and mine love the stand on scratcher.  Go figure.<br /><br />So this is a decent product and worth trying - if your cats don't like it, you are only out $11 and you can always donate to a local shelter - or try swapping with a fellow feline-owner!

review/summary: My cats love it!
review/text: As with all cat toys/products, it depends upon the cat. I have two cats (one female feline, and one boy cat-shaped entity&lt;- we think he's a cat, but he's stupid, and doesn't behave like one).<br />Anyways, I have several of the cardboard scratchers, but this one is the first one my boy has EVER used properly. He generally doesn't even know what his claws or for, or how to use them, and just rubs/rolls around on the flat scratchers. He also loves trying to stick his head into the little hidey-hole.<br /><br />My girl loves anything that she can scratch, and loves even more a challenge of getting a toy out of a difficult spot (as shown by the graveyard of toys under the oven and fridge). All in all, definitely a great product for my household. this and the ball-in-a-donut are the only toys/entertainment my cats regularly use!

review/text: Every person's cat is different. I actually have two, one will not scratch anything that is not carpet. The other loves these cardboard scratching things. Of course, one of my cats wont use it (which I expected). The other one adores this product. I've never purchased an incline scratcher before so I didn't know if he'd like it. I find it in a different spot every morning which leads me to believe that he has a good time with it while I'm sleeping. It's super durable and provides hours of entertainment to my cat. The only thing is, like I mentioned, I find it in a different spot every morning. I wish it was a bit heavier so he wouldn't be able to push it around. And the cat toy is still in place, which I'm very surprised about. Overall, try this product... it's great!

review/text: My cat loves cardboard scratchers and this was no exception. He shredded through the first side in one night. Now he is laying on it to keep the others away and let them know "this is mine". I love that cardboard scratchers are biodegradable and recyclable. The picture was deceiving, it showed a mouse toy but actually has a paper crinkle ball. This is okay since my  big boy would only be interested if it came with a live one. But my kitten quickly fished it out and deposited the little paper wad under the fridge.

review/summary: low price, but lightweight, inclined scratcher
review/text: I got this scratcher for my older kittens (who are just shy of 1 year), they prefer scratching non-horizontal surfaces, and that usually has meant the furniture rather than the flat cardboard scratchers I've tried to lean against the walls.<br /><br />Both kittens were initially fascinated with this scratcher, and went after it with gusto, but got bored with it after about a week.  I could probably rekindle their interest by adding fresh catnip to the surface.<br /><br />During the week, the scratcher moved around a lot, often ending on its side, as the kittens played with it and played through the openings in its sides.  The smaller kitten could fit her head into the opening.  Considering this is normal cat behavior, the scratcher should be a little heavier to keep it from falling over so easily.<br /><br />The kittens loved the toy inside the opening especially, which was a paper poof on a string, and dragged the scratcher around by the string.  But the toy tore loose within 3 days.<br /><br />Overall, a very good design and a decent value.  The cats enjoyed it, but it could be heavier, and the toy inside the base could be sturdier.

IT'S PAPER!!!!!  They couldn't even use material or rubber on the ball.  They say it comes with a "Toy Cat Toy" that dangles inside the thing.  It looks like a paper pom pom, no mouse like  they infer in their photo of it.  All in all it's really cheap and crappy materials.  I won't buy it again.

review/summary: Cats LOVE it! Me, not so much...
review/text: I bought a few of these scratchers for my kitties for Christmas, and they were a hit. In our combined household there are 8 cats, some of whom are scratchers, some are not. Of those who are scratchers, they immediately took to the Kong. I put a bit of catnip on it to entice them, but I'm not sure it was needed; they were intrigued by the incline-design, and by the toy inside, which, as other reviewers have pointed out, is not a plush mouse as pictured but rather a "pom" ball made of crunchy paper. At the time of this review, three months later, none of the pom balls have survived their fastening to the inside of the scratcher, but they still serve a purpose as loose kitty toys. (As a side note, I didn't buy this as a replacement for couch-scratching, so I can't comment on its effectiveness in that regard; I bought it as a fun toy. I'm not sure there IS a replacement for couch-scratching; I figure with 8 cats, couch-scratching goes along with the territory, and I'm ok with that.)<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned the "flimsy" design of these scratchers, so I won't belabor the point except to agree that yes, the all-cardboard design IS flimsy indeed, and along with this, only one of the scratchers I received was put together properly. The foot-base of the second scratcher was haphazardly taped on, and on the third, it was missing entirely. I did find it later, loose in the shipping box, but by then I'd already secured the foot-base myself using packaging tape.<br /><br />The one thing I'd like to point out which I haven't seen mentioned in any other review is the MESS these scratchers make. The kitties love them, sure, but as they scratch they tear up bits and pieces of paper from the scratching tray which then get strewn all over the room. (Again, no one has mentioned this, but there is a customer picture in the product description which shows this phenomenon quite clearly.) Now, if you're someone who vacuums every day, this might not be a concern for you...but if you're someone like me, who vacuums once every week (or so), then man, you are going to have a mess on your hands.<br /><br />I'm rather surprised no one else has commented on this; maybe you all vacuum regularly, in which case I applaud you. But it's definitely something I will take into consideration for future scratchers, which is why I'm only giving this one three stars...five stars from the kitties, one from me. In the future, I'd be "inclined" (ahem) to buy a similar design, this time with a carpeted surface (and a sturdier foundation), if such a thing exits. I have a couple of stand-up carpeted scratching posts, but the Kongs seem to get the most workouts, and I think that's because of the incline-design, not so much the scratching surface. We have a flat cardboard scratcher that we've had for years, and it gets so little use that the cardboard "shedding" isn't a concern at all.<br /><br />Still, I'll continue to keep these around for now and occasionally vacuum up the accumulated debris until they're shredded beyond usability, because...well...the cats DO love them, and happy cats make for happy people. :)

review/text: The Kong Incline Scratcher came just as described: an incline with catnip and a hole for a toy. The little toy is a ball-shaped thing which appears to be made of crinkled paper - I'm fine with that. It goes with the whole recyclable/natural packaging. However, within two minutes of my kitty noticing it and playing with it, half of the toy came off! I tied the remaining stretchy cord around the rest of the toy, and my little kitty went to town on that. But really: if a cat is going to use a toy, use something that will hold up for more than five minutes, please! I don't know how long the rest of the "toy" will last, but given what's happened so far, I'm guessing it won't have a long life.

review/text: I got this scratcher because my cat and her kittens were starting to use my bed as a scratching post. i think it may have survived if the kittens hadn't seen it, but the cardboard base only lasted 10 minutes. now they all fight over who gets to sit in the collapsed base. they still scratch the pad rather than then my bed so that's a plus, but i think i will just get refills and put them on the floor from now on since that's what they will do anyway. I gave this product 3 stars because my Kittens loved it but I was disappointed and how flimsy the construction was and how quickly 4 one and a half pound kittens destroyed it. Not bad for the price though.

review/summary: A great scratching post
review/text: I wouldn't have believed how quickly our cats took to this new scratching post!  For years we've tried sisal rope tied around a bannister, a rope fish, various carpeted things and NONE of them has been used like this cardboard thing.  Cheap thrills for the cats, and much better for them and US than furniture!

review/summary: The Panther likes it...LOL...
review/text: I rescued a 6 year old feral in Death Valley a couple of months ago.  The Panther is 22lbs, excellent health and growing.  He's adjusted to "captivity"  very well.  He's actually quite a mellow cat.  I purchased this product because he started clawing oak cabinets and pretty much anything else that came into his view as he made the rounds in my house.  I purchased the Kong and a kitty scratch post to address this situation.  As soon as I received the Kong, he immediately went to it and started using it.  He seems disinterested in the scratch post.  I think it's a good value and it looks like it's going to last a long time.

review/summary: somehow more appealing than a flat surface
review/text: My cat loves these incline cat scratchers.  He won't touch the ones that lay flat on the floor.  It was time to buy a replacement and I chose this brand because of the price and the free shipping.  (It was several dollars cheaper than the ones at the local big box pet store.)  My cat loves it, and I don't even bother to sprinkle the catnip on it.

review/summary: great scratching pad but not good enough
review/text: My cat love it when I sparkled the catnip on the surface of the pad, and this cat is a little picky that I was worried about that he didn't like the scratching pad before. But now it came out that my cat like it. However, I want to complaint the only thing is, the toy underneath is not a toy mouse,but a mass of paper, which is different from what it shows on this website.

review/summary: The upside: It's lightweight. The downside: It's lightweight...
review/text: Without a car of our own the small size and light weight of the Incline Scratcher seemed like definite features (as did the price!), so we happily took one home. Our pair of boisterous Bengals enjoyed poking at the paper pom-pom inside, and were intrigued by the scratching surface. But when they tried leaning on it to sharpen their claws it slid right out from under them or tipped over, despite being braced in a corner of the room. That was enough for SisterCat - she wasn't interested in going near it again, no matter how much we coaxed or cajoled.<br /><br />We tried weighing it down firmly, and BrotherCat gave it another go... at which point his claws caught in the cardboard and he ended up pulling the entire scratching-pad out from the main structure. That was it for him. We've kept it around just in case, but it's just been gathering dust - neither cat showed any interest again.<br /><br />We ended up with an Armarkat Cat Tree, and a scratching mat. Both do a far better job of standing up to the energetic feline pair and their antics.<br /><br />I do like the concept of the Incline Scratcher - it's clever, environmentally-friendly and affordable - though I can see it leading to cardboard scraps all over the floor if it's actually used. It might be good for kittens or small cats - I'll probably donate it to kitten rescue or the like.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this product is just not up to the force a largish, active cat can apply.

review/summary: Kitty not impressed.
review/text: The pom-pom ball inside the hole didn't last very long and that was the only thing my cat was interested in. Once that was gone, this just became junk in our living room. When we first got it, I can tell he was curious about it and made many attempts to "scratch" but the scratcher is so lightweight, it would just slide across the floor when he'd try to scratch it and my cat didn't like that. It doesn't help that it is also held in place by cardboard, so it's not very sturdy.

review/summary: Furniture Saver
review/text: I've had a cat or cats for most of my life and have always had a carpeted scratching post for them.  I don't believe in declawing<br />and have learned to put up with the inevitable scratching on my furniture. However, when I took in a stray cat two years ago I started contemplating extreme measures as she was not only going after the fabric furniture but had moved on to the leather couch and chair and didn't seem at all interested in the carpeted scratching posts. I found this style of scratcher when I was visiting a friend.  As soon as I brought this into the house the offending cat pretty much ceased her furniture scratching and uses these exclusively. The other two cats in the house also like it.  I've had two of them for over a year and they have held up well considering they are cardboard. The scratcher part is dual sided so when one side is shredded you just flip it over. I had to tape the bottom corners but that's about it.  I just put in an order for another!

review/summary: Cats love it but it is way overpriced
review/text: Yes it is a lot cheaper than one you get at your local pet store, but seriously... it's cardboard. This should be 1/2-1/3 the price they're charging, if that.<br /><br />But our cats seem to really miss it when they finally wear it down and we toss it, so I guess I'm stuck buying them. :)

review/summary: Cat Tested. Mother approved.
review/text: I buy one of these for my two kitties every couple of months. It takes them a few weeks to tear up one side, and break the box down a little. The other side lasts them a few more weeks though, and they don't scratch anything else.<br /><br />They generally rip the toy out the first day. For that reason I'm taking off a star. Overall, two months of a scratch free apartment for $10.00 is a pretty good deal. &lt;(^.^)>

review/summary: A decent inexpensive cat scratcher - but is a bit messy and isn't pretty.
review/text: Our new home has more rooms and the cats follow up into whichever room we're in and then they scratch whatever is at hand.  We needed to provide a scratching post option in each room to try to save our furniture.  I bought half a dozen of these Kong incline scratchers and they fit the bill.  Here's what's good and what's not:<br /><br />Hots:<br /><br />* Cheap<br /><br />* Incline shape and decent size works for my cats.<br /><br />* comes with a little packet of catnip.  Catnip is necessary to catch cats attention at first.  Then they come to know it and don't need the catnip to keep using it.  Whenever I flip the scratching surface over I rub more in.  You want the catnip to be rubbed into the holes in the corrugation so cats dig to get it and then recognize the cardboard as a good material to exercise their claws.<br /><br />* little hanging toy inside provides momentary interest.<br /><br />* replaceable scratching surface for when the included one wears out.<br /><br />Nots:<br /><br />* Look cheap - it's a cardboard box.  This doesn't enhance your decor.  The alternative is to buy nicely carpeted posts or climbing sculptures.  These cost a ton more and take up more room.  I found I was easily able to live with this issue.<br /><br />* Creates mess.  When cats scratch on cardboard they leave bits of shredded cardboard around for you to sweep up.<br /><br />* Cardboard isn't the most durable material (ha ha).  I find I must flip the inserts every 4-6 months and replace each year.<br /><br />* unit moves around.  Because it's a cardboard box with no mass and nothing to hold it in place it tends to migrate around the room as cats use it.  Sometimes I have to fish it out from under tables.<br /><br />All in all I haven't regretted buying these and putting them all around the house.  The price is right.  The cats use them.  That's the bottom line for me.

review/summary: Great scratcher but refills don't fit
review/text: This is a great cat scratcher.  The incline makes it more fun than the flat pads on the floor.  I keep a 5 pound dumbbell tucked inside so my 15 pound cat doesn't topple it over.  The cardboard does shred and make a mess but all the cardboard scratchers share this problem so I just keep it in an out of the way corner.  It takes a few months to wear down then I flip it over.  My only complaint is having to order a new one everytime since the refills just don't fit.  I've tried refills from Kong and other companies but none are the right size so they either require trimming to size (messy and time consuming) or they are too small and the cat pulls them out during use.  I know its not expensive, but buying a new one everytime feels very wasteful.  If they started making refills that fit available, I'd add a star.

review/summary: Cats love it, but they don't vacuum
review/text: Our five (yes, five) cats absolutely love the Kong Incline scratching post.  We have a few scattered around the house.<br /><br />It's lightweight, somewhat flimsy and produces the nagging feeling that you should have invented this simple item yourself, but it would seem that the cats consider those attributes.  Not only do they scratch, the move the post around the room, use it as a surfboard and even enjoy elongating it by sliding the corrugated scratching insert out of place.<br /><br />If your cats are like ours, they will absolutely love this simple toy. And we did receive a mouse as a play toy, not a crinkled wad of paper.  My only complaint is that this toy eventually shreds into tiny pieces.  Everywhere.  If you don't mind keeping a hand-vac at the ready, you're good to go but you will be vacuuming up after your cats for this life of this toy.

review/text: My cat loves this.  She scratches on it throughout the day which really saves our couch.  She wont scratch on a flat surface, usually she stands up and gets the back of furniture.  SInce we bought this, she has taken right up to it and runs to it when she wants to scratch.  The mouse is not a mouse inside but a tissue ball that was ripped up the first day.  I did put a 5lb weight inside to keep it from moving around on her.  Great product over.  Having a hard time finding refills but since amazon lowered the price to $7 (was $11) I will just buy another.

After a few weeks, the cardboard wears out and little particles of it go everywhere every time the cats use it, making a huge mess.

review/summary: Kittens' favorite toy!
review/text: I bought this incline scratcher for my 3 foster kittens and it is by far their favorite toy. We never even used the catnip; they were immediately fascinated with it. This great for kittens: of course they love to keep their claws trim and exercise their arms and paws by simply scratching on it, but they also love to chase each other up and down the ramp, squeeze through the hole (there is a hole on each side), attack the paper toy (not furry mouse, as others have noted, but it's held up very well anyway), and especially hide inside of it.  We've had this scratcher for a month now and they haven't destroyed it yet, though they have been working at chewing the edges, so I suspect the whole cardboard structure would be destroyed before the scratching pad itself needed replacing. Since the foster kittens will be adopted in a few weeks and for health reasons I don't intend to save this to use with any other cats, I don't need a cat scratcher that is going to last for years, and for $7 (and free shipping with Amazon Prime) this seems worth a couple months of scratching fun.  I would recommend this scratcher for anyone with kittens because they will love to play on it and inside it, and since kittens can be kind of messy, you probably don't want to invest in a scratcher that you're not going to want to throw away and and are going to have a hard time cleaning anywat.

review/text: My cat really enjoys this scratcher and uses it several times a day.  I've had it for a few months and while it's sort of worn, it still has much use left.  As others have noted, the mouse-toy isn't a mouse, but a crinkly ball.  My cat was only slightly interested in the toy for a few seconds and has never since looked for it. The best tip was in another review - thanks to the person who suggested putting a weight in the bottom. It made a big difference!  My cat is only 8 pounds but without the 5-pound hand weight, the scratcher moved around a bit.  The weight makes it much more stable.  I plan to buy at least one more of these scratchers, and Amazon has them for a really good price.

review/summary: Great price
review/text: My cats love scratchers, but I tend not to buy them, because I am flabbergasted but the price that companies charge....seriously? I work with corrugated on a regular basis and know what these things cost to make...pennies. Anyway, this is the best price that I've found, so until I get the motivation to actually make my own, I'll purchase this model. I will say that the "mouse" inside the structure turned out to be a ball of crepe paper. They still played with it, but destroyed it in a single day.
