review/summary: The only thing that works
review/text: We have spent three years trying to get rid of pocket gophers in our N.M. back yard. We have spent many hundreds of dollars on other traps, store-bought gas bombs, "professional" gopher trapper, and "professional" gaser (from the pest company--they use aluminum phosphide). Nothing worked. The first day I set out four of these, I caught a pocket gopher in one of them. In one case, I didn't have the trap positioned precisely enough and the vermin got around it.<br />Placing the traps does take time and practice, but it's the only thing that has worked at all. Unlike poisons, you see the proof of its success. I do not use carrots in the traps. I've used a piece of sandstone or paper on the outside of the trap to keep dirt out and then cover the trap with soil again. I have to dig out the trap in a day or two, but it's the only way to be sure no light is getting through.

review/summary: Just what I have been looking for.
review/text: After trying every means to get rid of gophers without killing them I had to step up to something like this. This little box is the only thing that has worked for me. After dealing with gophers for the last 8 months I was able to trap three gophers in 48 hours you cant beat that. Just find a new spot where dirt is pushed up fresh, dig a small hole in the tunnel, I used a little dab of peanut butter inside the trap, set it, cover with loose dirt, and check periodically throughout the day. One gopher did get trapped and not killed so I did have to kill it myself. Do yourself a favor and save your landscape and money by just starting with one of these if you have a gopher problem.

review/summary: Last resort
review/text: I bought this trap as an ultimate resort.  For two years our gopher chomped away happily in the garden undisturbed by us.  We were ok with him until he started heading for the patio and the pole barn floor and chewing through front garden plantings.  I had tried caster oil granules, battery and solar powered noise making devices: even my dogs tried to scare him off. All attempts at deterring his path failed (including fire ants) and we finally had to trap him.  This device works exactly as described (we placed a carrot in the ventilation hole to stop him packing it out)  and while we were unhappy to have to use it we can recommend it as a last effort.  It would be better if the coyotes did the job for us. Be very careful where you put your hands!

review/summary: Exelent trap
review/text: It worked but after trying several times. No instructions are provided that's why I give it less than 5 stars. I wish Victor Company would care a little bit more and add some good instructions on how to place the trap. The box has some ideas on the outside but not use instructions...<br /><br />Update:  After learning and using it several times it works perfectly, a kill every time, just make sure you put a couple of little pieces of wet (for enhanced odor) carrot through the light hole. Gophers can not resist it and fall for it every time.

review/text: Best trap on the market. Yes, you have to excavate a bit to place the trap. The dirt floor of this trap is great at tricking the gopher! I baited with peanut butter and carrot and bagged a large, female, gravid western pocket gopher. She killed half of the baby native coastal live oaks on my property and destroyed the hillside. I excavated out the region of this same tunnel which might have a dead smell and have reset a second Victor trap (fresh with no dead smell). Wish me luck.

Still feeling horrible about killing them...but they are tearing h*ll in my yard and my young trees are at risk.  Bottom line, I can't believe anyone has not had success with this death merchant.

review/text: I was a bit skeptical of gopher traps in general since I've never really heard of them. Well, after watching my lawn get torn up by a gopher, I turned to Amazon and found this trap. I opted for this one since it was enclosed, which would appear to "funnel" the gopher into the trap. Anyway, per the instructions, I found an appropriate spot, and lo and behold, caught a gopher within a day! Totally satisfied and recommend this trap.

review/summary: Work GREAT to snuff out Seattle moles !!
review/text: I tried the black box based on input from a friend who is a golf course greenskeeper. He uses them with great success  to eliminate moles on his golf course. Remove surface dirt from mole mound and dig down into the dirt with a hand shovel to locate the tunnel. Locate the tunnel holes on each side of the hole you have dug out and dig enough dirt  to be able to put 2 black boxes back to back into the hole you have dug. Be sure that the black box opening is even with the tunnel floor and  right up against the mole tunnel hole on each side of the hole you have dug. Set the trap (similar to setting a mouse trap) and put soil loosely over the set traps to keep the light out but don't pack  the soil down. When the little bugger moves through that tunnel,  ZAP .... you got him!! There are are instructions for use on the box also.

Its smooth and creamy and sperads very easily on everything peanut butter would .  I cant taste the difference.  Its safe for schools.  Made from NON GMO roasted soybeans, cholesterol free, gluten free, no trans fats dairy free, panut and treenut free.  Nutritional label says :  2 tbsp are 190 calories, total fat 14 grams, sodium  100mg, total carbs 10 grams, fiber 4 grams, sugar 4 grams, protein 7 grams.<br />Its pricey but worth the money.  I buy this and other varieties of this brand all the time.  5  ( if not 10 )  stars. Truly DELICIOUS

review/summary: Good alternative to peanut butter
review/text: Our daughter's school went peanut-free, so we needed to find something besides our organic natural peanut butter for quick, economical lunches that she would actually eat. I just gave our daughter a whole wheat 'pbj' sandwich made with this and her favorite jelly, and she did not know it was soy nut butter. When I told her, she said it was good and tasted the same.  I will say, it does not taste like peanut butter if you try it straight from the jar, but on a sandwich it is pretty close. Makes a good nut butter-banana sandwich too. It is smooth and soft, easy to spread. The jar says no refridgeration needed. There are no hydrogenated oils so it is a healthy choice.

review/text: I have an adult foster home and always look for ways to make it easier for my hired help to cook delicious meals with less time.  Now---this sauce mix is so easy to make, you add water.  You do have to condense the amounts made (it takes a gallon of water to make the whole package) but I use 1 cup mix to 1 1/4 cup boiling water and sometimes I add a bit more water or milk to make it creamier.  But I use it on everything!!!  Chicken, shrimp, lobster, crab, small scallops.  It will easily serve 6 with my condensed recipe.  The best thing to remember is IT IS DELICIOUS!!!  Try it.

review/summary: Ok, but a bit sweet
review/text: Cereal was Ok, but a bit too sweet and not as good as I expected. You can't really taste the almonds.  FYI: There is no dried fruit in the cereal. The picture on the cover shows fresh raspberries, but you will need to add those yourself if you want them. The calorie count is a bit higher than I expected (nearly 300/one cup) but not bad if that's all you will eat in the morning. Better than a lot out on the market, in both taste and nutrition, but I prefer others, such as Post's Cranberry Almond, Wal-Mart's version of Special K with Strawberries, and Frosted Mini-wheats.<br /><br />It is nice to know that part of the profits are going to community projects (10 percent).

I was little skeptical but he loved everything about this cereal - taste, crunchiness, stuff, nutrition and last but not least, its price. At other regular stores its close to five bucks, but at Amazon.com we simply subscribe and really save big.

review/summary: A pleasant surprise
review/text: I don't need gluten-free pasta but I like trying new foods. I was pleasantly surprised with the ditalini in the 250 gr box (9 ozs). I like this small pasta to put in soups and sides. It is a beautiful yellow color and tastes great. I was also very happy that it comes packaged in a bag within a box.  That means no chance of little critters getting inside the inner sealed package, love that. Most pastas out there do not have pastas in a secondary plastic insert and I've had to throw boxes out b/c I didn't get to eat them b/4 the critters did! The expiration date on these is also great--Sept of 2012 and it is only February of 2011 as I type this. On the ingredient label I do not see any listing for the fiber content which I like to know b/c I'm on WW; but that's a small negative.  This is made in Italy which seems to me a place that knows their pasta.  All in all, a good find and I will share it with friends, celiac and non-celiac alike.

review/text: I have several family members with celiac's so cooking for a large italian family gathering is a huge challenge if you want to keep your meals simple when pasta is a must have menu item.  I've tried all the brown rice based pasta brands with mixed results.  They are either cook up too gummy, release a lot of starch in the water while cooking, fall apart when mixing the cooked pasta with other ingredients or they do not make great left-overs the next day.  The Le Veneziane pasta is fantastic!  My very picky daughter didn't even realize she was eating gluten-free pasta (she always turned her nose up for the brown rice pasta).  This corn based pasta cooks, feels and taste like the "real" deal and my entire family now prefer this brand over all other wheat based or gluten-free pasta.

review/text: I first discovered this pasta at the NYC restaurant Nizza (if you're gluten-free, you NEED to check them out!). The first time I had this pasta, I was not on the gluten-free diet but I tried some of my Mom's dish (she has Celiac's). As someone who knows what the real thing tastes like, I was absolutely amazed that this pasta was gluten-free. I actually preferred this to regular pasta. It doesn't give you that heavy feeling after eating, and it's great with basically any recipe. I'm now eating gluten-free, and we order this by the case. Skip the other gluten-free pastas (that generally taste like cardboard) and try this, I promise you will be amazed!

review/text: There are a lot of foods I can't have - wheat is one of them. I have tried several different brands of gluten free pasta and while they were okay or good enough to eat none of them gave me the satisfaction that wheat pasta did. Until I tried this.<br /><br />This pasta acts like wheat pasta - cooks up very well and it is just as good the next day. Stays together - doesnt fall apart like some GF pastas and holds any type of sauce you put on it.<br /><br />However, if you make it too el dente the next day it will be a little harder and you wont be able to eat it cold (pasta salad) without reheating it with a little oil or butter.<br /><br />I didnt follow the instructions for cooking instead I cooked it this way:<br /><br />Bring water and salt to a boil - put the pasta in - and boil for one min. Cover and turn off - let sit in the hot water for 8 mins. (keep it covered)<br /><br />This worked great for me and comes out perfect each time. You can go up to 9 mins - but i wouldnt leave it too long unless you like pasta on the mushy side.<br /><br />I'm so happy I found this by mistake - I love this and its wonderful to be able to have a good wheat free pasta!

review/summary: Ohhh so delicious!  THE perfect gluten free pasta.
review/text: The La Veneciane fetuccine pasta is absolutely delicious.  I have tried many, many different types of gluten free pasta in the past, quinoa based, brown rice based (tinkada, trader joe's) and they all come out somewhat mushy and just don't entice me to eat them.  This pasta comes out in texture exactly as wheat versions.  The taste is delicious and you cannot tell that it is gluten free.  It is perfect with just plain olive oil or truffle oil and garlic and also adapts well with regular tomato based or pesto sauces.  Would highly, highly recommend this product to everyone, gluten free or not!  I will never buy gluten free pasta again, my search is over.

review/summary: Best Gluten-Free Pasta I Have Tried
review/text: Most of the time, going gluten-free because of a recent celiac diagnosis has been fairly easy to do. You just have to remember to be vigilant, ask a lot of questions and read all labels and ingredients lists. Realistically, who is going to actually MISS crappy fast food (most of which is loaded with gluten)?<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago after peppering my favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant with questions about their gluten-free preparation methods, I decided to roll the dice and order a gluten-free pasta dish.<br /><br />Wow. It was so good, with the taste and consistency of regular semolina pasta, that I was extremely nervous that I had blown it. Needless to say, I was wrong and felt fine after enjoying the meal.<br /><br />After trying countless gluten-free pasta types and brands: rice, buckwheat, quinoa, corn, etc. etc... Le Veneziane is absolutely hands down THE best gluten-free pasta out there period. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />The owner of the restaurant gave me some to take home and then the hunt was on to actually FIND some in a store. Then again, why bother when you can buy it by the case and get free 2-day shipping?

She had gotten so used to mediocre tasting pasta that she forgot how good it can be. We got the brand name before we left and now that's all we use. It comes from Italy and is a bit more expensive but well worth it. Love love love

I usually order the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FIXT2I">Steamed Brown Rice Bowl, Organic, Microwaveable, 7.4-Ounce Bowls (Pack of 12)</a> which I find is the PERFECT brown rice. But I wanted a way to make it myself but I've always failed miserably with regular store bought brown rice. What I hadn't realized is that usually most grocers sell LONG grain rice, which doesn't have the texture or flavor of this wonderful rice. Short grain brown rice swells up when steamed and has a chewy texture, not mushy. It tastes great with a bit of olive oil and sea salt when served. I followed the directions on the package, which is 2 1/2 cups of water for every cup of rice and simmer covered for about 45 minutes after it starts boiling. But my rice came out a bit hard, so I added 1/2 more water and it came out perfect. So the ratio is 1 cup of rice: 3 cups water. I love this rice!

review/text: Anyone who grew up in South Africa loves Mrs. Balls Chutney. I have been living in the USA for twenty years and have tried many chutneys, including many from local Indian Groceries and home-made varieties from speciality stores. Nothing quite beats the taste of this brand. I know many recipes that use this chutney to make a wonderful marinade, or sauce for chicken dishes as well. These recipes can be found on line. I was delighted to find that Amazon had listed this incredible product. I bought six bottles and as soon as they are finished, I know where I can find them again. Either the Regular or the Peach varieties are a family favorite, even amongst my American born children. Thank you Amazon.

Now that I tried it on American food, I can't believe how good it really is.  It adds such a new twist to the same old foods.  I looked to buy it in the US stores and couldn't find it anywhere.  I was so happy to find a vendor and even more impressed that it wasn't overpriced.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product

review/summary: The worst!
review/text: This pasta was terrible. First of all, it is expensive, even on sale. Second, it has no flavor whatsoever. I expect that from a rice-only pasta, but this was not hearty or interesting at all. And the worst part was that when we cooked it, it broke into tiny pieces! The longest strand of "spaghetti" we got out of this box was less than one inch long; average length maybe 1/2 inch. It turned the cooking water into a thick, nasty soup of excess starches, and even covered in a hearty sauce was hard to eat and certainly not worth it. Never buying this again!!

review/text: This product fell apart into little pieces about 2 minutes after I put it into boiling water.  The flavor was OK (bland) but the texture was disgusting.  The end result looked like Chef Boyardee spaghetti and tasted worse.  Because the spaghetti contained quinoa, I expected to have a similar texture to quinoa pasta (which is actually quite good) but "mush" is the best way to describe the texture.

review/summary: Good Product!
review/text: Both of my dogs really enjoyed this rawhide alternative bone. My dogs have been eating real rawhide for several years, with seemingly no issues. Recently, one of my dogs had a terrifying near-death experience; choking on a rawhide. After doing some research, I learned that this isn't an uncommon situation, and that rawhides are a known choking hazard. After the incident, I quickly researched different rawhide alternative bones, and theses ones were one of the first we have tried. They have more of a leathery texture, softer and more flexible than a rawhide. However, they are not soft treats that can be chewed up quickly, it still took my dogs some time to eat them, and enjoying them for about 10 minutes. One thing that I really liked about these bones is that they don't get stringy, slimy, and sticky like rawhides do. They get softer with chewing, and then brake off into smaller pieces, unlike rawhides that won't brake off, making the dream bones less of a choking hazard. Another great thing about these bones is that they smell really good, they have parsley and chlorophyl and other good smelling ingredients. They only reason I gave them a 4 star rating and not a 5 star rating is because the first ingredient (the most prevalent) is corn. Corn isn't the greatest thing for pets to consume because its not easy to digest. I avoid corn in pet food at all costs, but because this is a treat- and not a main food staple, I think it is okay. If I could, I would give these bones 4.5 stars. I do recommend these- especially over regular rawhides.

review/summary: My dog had a severe allergic reaction
review/text: I tried this for the first time. I was attracted to it because it claimed it was 99% digestable, and did not pose the choking/blockage hazard that rawhide does.<br /><br />My dog loved it - but it did not last long. He consumed it within 3 minutes. Then about 20-30 minutes later, we had a BIG PROBLEM. He went into a seizure - both of his rear legs locked up, he was flailing his front legs around trying to get back up, his heart was pounding, he was panting heavily, had his teeth clenched, he was heavily salivating, and he defacated. He finally started to act relaxed, and then his eyes lost all life - I thought I was watching my dog die in front of me.<br /><br />Luckily, this event subsided, and he went back to normal. About 30 minutes after the seizure, he had a full bowel movement. Later, he ate a regular dinner and had another regular bowel movement, so that told me it wasn't a blockage. He is only 3 yrs old and strong as an ox (85 lb Collie), I have my doubts that it could be epilepsy or a brain tumor. I think he had a severe allergic reaction to the kelp and chlorophyl contained in the snack, or possibly that particular bag was tainted somehow. The sell-by date was good. It was highly coincidental that this all happened so shortly after feeding him this snack. I threw the rest of the snacks away, and I will never buy them again.

review/summary: Most Dangerous Thing My Dog Ever Chewed
review/text: This is the most dangerous thing my mini schnauzer ever put in her mouth, except when she ate a dark-chocolate candy bar.  Yesterday, when she chewed the Medium-Size thing, (Not the Mini, but apparently the same material) it cracked into little pieces much like a cheap plastic toy. She managed to break the thing into a handful of pieces mostly the size of a small fingernail.  The hard pieces had sharp edges all around, and many had little sharp spikes (1/8 to 1/4 inch long).  The vision of these sharp edges sliding down her throat makes me cringe. I am thankful that my pet escaped harm.<br />If you use this product, watch your animal carefully as it chews it, being alert for sharp edges. Keep the package sealed to avoid drying out of the product and resultant brittleness.

review/summary: Misleading reviews
review/text: I was just a little wary ordering this because of the other reviews that said it was super salty and way too tough. But I gave it a shot anyway. I don't know if it was because I ordered a different flavor(Teriyaki) or if I just got lucky. Nonetheless, I think these jerky strips are some of the best I've ever had. I will admit to the fact that they are just a little salty, but nothing an ice cold cola or beer of your choice won't fix. As per being tough, I munched down five or six right out of the container as soon as I opened it. I just couldn't stop myself, they were that good. For all that chewing my jaw is none the worse for the wear. So for those of you out there that are real jerky fans, this is definitely worth trying.<br /><br />**Update** I did a little research because I was curious as to why everyone thought this jerky was too salty. I looked up the nutrition facts on all 4 flavors. Both the Original & Peppered contain 650mg of sodium, the Wood Smoked had 570mg, and the Teriyaki has only 440mg of sodium. So if you thought the others were too salty, or are worried about this jerky being too salty, try the teriyaki. I highly recommend it. It's not too salty, just a hint of sweet from the teriyaki, but still nice pepper flavor as well.

review/summary: Great sticks
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AWBL82">Jack Link's Smokehouse Beef Jerky Strips, Wood Smoke, 30-Count Jar</a> These are the real deal when it comes to jerky. The whole family loves them. When the grandkids come over they wipe me out. The 2 year old looks for the container sitting on the microwave and says Paw Paw, Stick. These come once a month via the Amazon Subscribe and Save. Just another great quality Jack Link's product. One of the few companies that got big, but never sacrificed quality in the process!

review/summary: Very salty
review/text: I purchased the Wood Smoked flavor.  The reviewers who said that these are too salty were right.  They tastes like sticks of salts.  If you nibble on them very slowly, then they tastes ok as the salts disolve slowly.  If you take a big bite, then it would be like biting into a chunk of salt.  I love the texture and the stringiness of this beef jerky but I would not buy it again because of the high sodium content.

review/summary: Godly King B beef jerky strips are back.
review/text: I used to eat these King B beef jerky sticks all the time when I was younger, they were my favorite! I figured once King B was gone so was my beloved jerky, but luckily Jack Links has brought it back. This jerky is above and beyond any of that overly-sweet bagged jerky Jack links sells. No, instead this is the way jerky should be, nice and chewy and salty yum. I know some people on here complained about the saltiness but I don't think they're overly salty, they're just plain delicious. Order some, you won't regret it.

review/summary: Believe the reviews - Way too salty
review/text: This beef jerky is extremely salty. I tried the wood smoked flavor, and I figured people were just being a bit picky. However, it really is overpowering and although it has a decent smoky flavor the salt is just way too much. The container says 570mg sodium or 24% of daily value for one serving. I would recommend trying a different product.

Real strips of beef, not ground up hamberger, that tastes like meat instead of preservatives without teriyaki or any other flavoring or sauce.  Good price, good product and great taste.  You'll be happy with this one.  When I'm looking for a non sugary snack, I reach for this first.

review/summary: Way Too Salty
review/text: I read the reviews and thought, I like salt. I thought the saltiness was on the exterior of the jerky.  There is very little salt taste on the outside of the jerky but the saltiness comes out with every chew. The strips are about the size of a chopstick or a very thin pencil. 12 ounces for $20+ is way too expensive.  There is very little beef flavor but too be fair it is probably covered up by the salt.  These taste very similar to the chopped and formed cheap jerky at the convenience mart that you swear you will never buy again but much more salty. The amount of salt made my tongue numb, if you want good jerky keep looking. (Jack Link's Smokehouse Beef jerky strips, wood smoked 30-count jar)

review/text: I like almost everything about this jerky, the toughness and chewiness. But it is just too salty. If you nibble it, you may enjoy it but that is not how i eat. Also, it is not good for my health to eat something this salty. I have run into too many of salty beef jerky patches recently. This review is for the wood smoked, but if other flavors contains the same amount of salt per serving, they will be just as salty. Why everything is either too fatty, sweet or salty??? Are they trying to get us addicted?

review/text: I buy jerky all the time, always willing to try something new. I've even made my own at home. I agree with the review that called these salt sticks, they are way too salty for my taste. Also, being a jerky eater for 40+ years, I eat it because i like the toughness and chewiness of jerk. But the tube I got was nearly un-chewable. I have bit into some hard jerky in my time, but jeez louise, these were literally like chewing leather, many of the strips would not yield to my super powered bite.

review/summary: I didn't know beef jerky was supposed to be soupy!!!
review/text: I don't eat beef jerky, and I wanted to buy some for a Christmas gift.  I read all of the reviews at Amazon.com and decided that Jack Links would be the best purchase.  It came nicely packaged, but there is liquid in the packaging - a lot of it.  If you turn the packaging upside down, the movement of the liquid is obvious.  So now I have to pay to return soupy beef jerky and buy a different type.<br /><br />Three days since my original review.  Amazon cannot accept returns of food items, so it kindly replaced the beef jerky.  The replacement also has liquid in it.  It's not fat, but a liquid as described above.  This time, I'm asking for a refund.
