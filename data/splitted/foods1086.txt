review/summary: Electric fence
review/text: This item worked great. I just installed an additional 300' privacy fence. Bought 1300' of 17 gauge wire with this system and set it all up in one day (appx 800' installed). I tested on myself and got a good zap to see what my dogs were about to expirence. I have a german shepherd, lab, and rotweiler. Now none of them go near the fence or try to escape.

review/summary: Works Great to Keep Dogs Inside Fence
review/text: I purchased this because my 2 neopolitan mastiffs would lift the chain link fence and go out to chase rabbits in the desert. After installing all long the fence (500 ft) I took the dogs to the corner where there was a hole where they used to easily get out. One dog got a shock and jumped away. I do not know if the other dog got shocked.  Then both dogs went all along the fence and looked for a place where were was no wire but there was none. So far they have not gotten out.  I intend to turn off the electricity after a couple of weeks to see if it still works.  Now I am going to set up wire around my garden. Very easy to install. I used black clips to hold it out from the chain link fence and handles to open at the gates. I unplug it when I go out and the dogs are in the house.

review/summary: Great Electric Fence
review/text: I've been battling against squirrels and racoons for the past 5 years.  They come up on my back deck and rip out any potted plants, knock things over, and kindly poop.  I bought some 1/2 in pvc piping and cut them to three foot sections, attached them to my deck with plastic zip ties, drilled small holes through the tops where I fed through some 16 gauge wire.  Once i connected to the Fi-Shock SS-725CS, the critters stopped coming up.  To tell the truth, the first day i hooked it up, i found two dead squirrels.  the next day, one dead squirrel and one chipmunk.  I'm guessing that this Energizer is really designed with larger pests (racoons, deer, dogs) in mind.  Have-A-Heart(attack?).  Great product.  Thanks.

review/text: I really like this fence energizer. It is strong enough that my Newfoundland is scared of it. I accidentally stepped on it a few days ago and my entire foot went numb! The only con about this system is it will easily have dead places if the cable isn't spliced together just right and the fence is clear of vegetation. I highly recommend this one if you have a dog who likes to escape!

review/text: After spending 50 bucks on rods to secure my chain link fence so my boxers couldn't crawl under and not keeping them in more than a few days before they found a new spot to get out, I decided to buy this.  I have been using this for two months now and they have not gotten out once.  Since I already had a bunch of 2ft rods I got the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BQRDYY">Zareba YRP25N Electric Fence Yellow Rod Post Insulator, 25-Pack</a> and set the wire (not included) about 1ft from the fence and around 10 inches above the ground.  The total for the insulators, wire, and charger was less then I paid for all the 2ft rods I tried to fix the fence with.  I wish I had thought of a fence charger sooner.

review/text: Fido-shock fence chargers have protected our equipment and kennel fencing for more than 20 years. We haven't ever had a burn or incident where an animal was stuck "on" the fence. I was really surprised to hear (bad review)that any animals had been harmed ever by the fido-shock. Birds are a special exception because they can land with both feet on the wire and be fine till they touch a grounded object with their beak. These chargers have worked continuously without failure for years, until they are dropped on the concrete or something.

Luckily it was cheaper at the local home store for an 8 footer and I cut it in half to suit my needs. The Charger worked exactly as expected. I tested it the only guaranteed way i know. And wow I see why the dogs don't like it. It didn't hurt at all, but was startling. Now back to gardening.

review/text: I installed this product to save my vegetable garden from squirrels and chipmunks. My garden was in severe attack by these predators before installing this product. I used two wire installation and created several sub circuits to protect the garden area. Initially I was worried after reading some of the messages that said that product has strong current and kills the smaller predators like squirrels and chipmunks. Although I, from inside of my heart, never wanted to kill these but I was so frustrated by their destruction, I decided to buy the product. To my surprise this product didn't kill any of the chipmunks or squirrels and worked very well to deter these predators and helped save my vegetable garden. May be the product was improved. Next year I look to save my pear tree from similar attacks. I like the product very much.....

review/summary: Fi-Shock SS725
review/text: Purchased one of these last July to replace an older unit that failed after about three years of use.  It sat in the package for a year before being installed today.  It does not produce hardly any voltage.  Ran a volt meter on it and only came up with 143v, not enough to even feel.  The last one worked great for those three years, so am not sure what is going on with this one.<br /><br />Guess I need to recant my above review; ran new wire all the way around, including a new ground wire.  The unit is now working just fine, so it turns out the problem was my own fault.  The fence tested out just fine now and the charger is working as it should.  Also makes me believe there is nothing wrong with the old one we replaced, just ignorance on my part.  Need to upgrade my review to five stars.  There is enough of a jolt that we should not have to worry about the dogs digging out, but not enough hurt them.

review/text: Effective but has killed several birds and squirrels. I wonder if a "pulsed" charge would be non-lethal...  perimeter should also be frequently inspected for shorts (limbs, grass, dead squirrels) as they render the downstream wire dead.  Check using a voltmeter at the end of the line to the dirt or a ground source.

review/text: Three of my relatives shepherds on our adjacent property would fence run along two neighbors yards, one with a obnoxious pit bull, another with a noisy black lab.  Much annoying barking<br />and I was constantly chasing the one instigator shepherd away.  Very annoying, even happening in the night.  And the dogs on both sides were damaging the fence.  Bought 12 three foot heavy metal stakes one from Home Depot with holes in them, ground off the paint at the bottom for better electrical contact.  Stakes were 1 foot from the fence, top hot Al wire stretched on insulators, about 1 1/2 foot high.  Added another ground wire half way in between, then added a 5 foot grounding copper rod in the soil.  Gets dry here in the summer, but the double ground is extra insurance (ground through ground wire and also through the soil).  So far, 3 shepherd dogs keep away, shy away after a few shocks, it is now very quiet and peaceful and the neighbors are also thankful.  So far this brand has worked fine.

review/summary: poor quality
review/text: I have long haired dachshunds which like to dig out.  In the beginning the fido 525cs worked but was not powerful as it would not shock through the long haired coat of my dachshunds. They had to hit it with the face or shorter haired (skin exposed) underbelly areas in order to get a good reaction on them. I had the fido 525cs set up for maybe 2 months before it stopped working completely and the dogs were back to getting out again.  No, it did not get wet as my husband built a wood box for the charger "house" of protection.  It just stopped working and by that time I had thrown away my receipt which was from a small garden center on an old type register so that it didn't list the product name anyway.  Thus no warranty proof nor refund available.<br /><br />I am looking for a better quality charger which will hit harder through the long haired coat. I have had stronger chargers which worked better and lasted longer than this model the fido 525cs.

I did not know to check for animal size and did not notice it on the picture of the package until the package arrived.

I had to hose off the porch a couple of times, and touch up some singe marks near the mailbox. But on the bright side -- nowadays the mail is ALWAYS on time. He delivers by 9:30, never a minute later. And you know, the afro look really suits him.

They transmitted a UPS return lable within 2 minutes and shipped it off.  Had my ok for refund within 3 days.  Now that's the way to do business.  I'm dealing with AMAZON whenever I can from now on.

review/text: I have been craving pizza so bad so I broke this out and was very satisfied. The crust is a bit sweet but with some Ragu tomato sauce, garlic powder and shredded cheese I was happy happy happy. The texture is thick like Neapolitan square style pizza as opposed to the New York thin crust. Anyway, I totally recommend this product if you are craving pizza. These microwave kits have a far better taste and texture than the freezer section gluten-free products I have tried.

review/summary: Christmas treat
review/text: I purchased this for Christmas 2011.  I love peppermint bark and like to try a new kind every year.  Its a very special yearly treat for me, so I expect a lot from the product.<br /><br />Pros for Scott's Cakes version:  Good organization and logistics:  the package arrived quickly, the candy was well wrapped in the shipping box and shrink-wrapped in a box of its own.  Candy was in good condition (i.e., no broken pieces) and fresh.<br /><br />This seller's peppermint bark achieves a nice mix of peppermint and white chocolate flavor.  White chocolate gives off a nice mellow tone; it is good quality.  There is no dark chocolate layer to upset the balance of peppermint and white chocolate flavors in one's mouth.  This attracted me to Scott's Cakes.<br /><br />Cons:  The quality of the peppermint pieces in the chocolate was very disappointing.  The ad mentions that the buyer should expect to see pieces of candy cane/peppermint starlight mints mixed with white chocolate.  The photo seems to support this claim, showing robustly sized pieces of candy cane in the bark.  I expected a very crunchy chewing experience, which I think is the hallmark of the best types of peppermint bark.  However, the pieces of peppermint candy are in reality very small; there is no sensation of crispness when taking a bite.  The peppermint candy has a chewy consistency, making it seem more like taffy.  Thus, there is no auditory pleasure in consuming this version of peppermint bark.

However, I do NOT recommend their "sea salt & herbs" mix, nor their bouillon without sea salt.  I'm sure for other kinds of dishes they might taste fine, but for my main cooking [asian], the simple "vegan/veggie bouillon with sea salt" is perfect.<br /><br />If you want a little less bouillon and a little more of your own style, just use one less bouillon than recommended [ie instead of 5 cubes for 10 cups, use 4 cubes].

I have always tried different coffees; Espresso, Cuban coffee in Miami, French Roast in Paris, and both Greek and Turkish coffees. However, I must admit that I have been settling for, and have grown accustom to the "drive-thru" swill that is called "Coffee". The Morning Glory experience was just that, Morning Glory. It was akin to drinking a fine wine, where you take your time enjoying the bouquet, the taste and the finish etc. No longer will I glug a cup of swill, but I will take just a few extra minutes to savor this great coffee. Again, thank you Amazon.com and Caffe Divino!

review/summary: A smooth and flavorful coffee
review/text: I am, admittedly, not a heavy coffee drinker. I do not drink coffee daily, but rather look at it as a postprandial treat or have it on mornings where I'm getting off to a slow start, rather than using it as a daily ritual. So when I do drink it, I want the best. Although I haven't had extensive experience with different coffee brands, "the best" currently qualifies as Good Morning, Morning Glory by Caffe Divino. I take my coffee black and don't like to add anything to it. So I prefer the taste of Good Morning, Morning Glory since there is a noticeable different in the standalone flavor of their roast when compared to other coffees. Their roast uses higher quality Arabica beans from South America, and it seems like a lot of attention is paid to the quality of the product. It is perfectly-balanced and a very smooth and full-flavored coffee with no bitterness.<br /><br />I originally ordered the ground roast but if you have your own grinder, I suggest trying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XPJCKI">Caff&eacute; Divino Gourmet Coffee, Good Morning, Morning Glory Roast, 100% High Grown Arabica, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a> as well. There is not too much of a discernible difference in taste but I really enjoy the smell of the whole bean after being ground.

review/summary: My cat likes it
review/text: I adopted a cat from the SPCA earlier this year.  She apparently had many food allergies.  Discovererd the problem was chicken.  Almost all cat foods have chicken in it. Everything you can buy at big box stores has chicken in it.  I went into a pet store and just read lables.  I tried several; one very similar to this cat food with just fish supposedly.  But my cat started sneezing and getting congested again.  So even though chicken meal wasn't mentioned, it made me wonder.  She could also eat foods with turkey but grew tired of it quickly and went on a hunger strike.  This food, she is thriving on it.  Gaining weight.  Fur is so soft.  No sneezing or congestion. I have purchsed this food at a nationwide pet mart, too, but Amazon's price is comparable, and if a prime member, delivery is free and quick.

I started out trying the pecans because pecans (Valdosta) have never been my nut of choice.  However, they tasted so terrific, I had a hard time putting them down.  The almond (Soledad) and cashews (Sing Buri)are delicious as well. I will not only be ordering these again, I will be trying some of Sahale's other snack products.<br /><br />If you have issues with gluten, please be aware that the cashew combination is not gluten free, but the almond and pecan combinations are.  So you might look for individual purchases.

review/text: I have met the creator/inventor of the Jelly Belly and I can report with full confidence, that this is one tasty Licorice Jelly Bean.  A Jelly Belly is smaller than Jelly Beans and that is why Ronald Reagan liked them so much.  My personal favorite flavor is Licorice.  5 STARS!

review/summary: Not what I thought
review/text: These jelly beans were very unusual when they showed up.  They came in a package without a jelly belly logo, the jelly beans themselves had no jelly belly logo, and I don't really know if they were actually jelly bellys.  I got them as a gift, so I didn't try any of them, but it was odd giving a gift where it didn't seem like they were anything special, like I'd bagged up some licorice jelly beans from the grocery store or something, big woop...so I was disappointed.  And because they were a gift I had no idea what they tasted like.  So were they really jelly bellys?  Who knows?  I felt silly giving them though.

review/summary: My cat went crazy for these
review/text: I have 2 cats and when I saw these I gave them a try. They both like treats but my younger male cat went crazy for these. He wouldn't let the female get near one to try. She is naturally more shy and a bit of a picky eater so I'm not sure she would have been game for these if she had been given a chance. I think she just needed some time to smell them before gulping them down as the male cat was doing. Giving them 5 stars because they were a super hit with the boy.

review/summary: the ONLY treats my cat loves!
review/text: My siameese cat has never liked any of the other types of treats I have offered, from kibble type treates by Innova, Greenies, and Whiskers to freeze dried treats from Whole Life and Pure Bites (beef liver).  He explodes in messy puke everywhere from any other type of freeze dried treats.  But he LOVES these shrimp treats!  They are perfect sized tiny freeze dried shrimp with no additives and is a product of the USA, which I like.  They come in a resealable pouch and they smell pretty tasty.  I have been tempted to try one but have so far resisted the urge.  If your cat loves seafood (who doesn't?) then your cat will love these!

review/text: My two rescue cats absolutely love these treats, we have the shrimp and the chicken.  They lived their 9 months in a room w/o windows and not much human contact at a shelter, and although we've had them almost a year now, one of them is still very shy.  These treats kind of opened him up and now he comes to his name and allows you to pet him when given his shrimp.  All I have to do is shake the bag and say "shrimp" and he comes running.  No other treat has done that for us!

review/summary: 1 cat loves it, 1 just likes it.
review/text: I was looking for treats I could use for training. Two adult cats were new to our home and were learning what repeatable behaviors to do more of (use the scratching post and other things.) I wanted to completely avoid treats full of carbohydrates or other nasties that my adult cats would get loaded up with.  It was suggested to me to take a look at freeze dried treats as an option and I liked that these didn't look like some of the others that looked like styrofoam peanuts that would crumble into dust if one was dropped on the floor!<br /><br />They are quite small and look exactly like the shrimp that come in the shrimp flavored cup-o-noodles soup. Since the shrimp are very flat and very small, sometimes it looks like it is a challenge for them to see the treat and also to pick the shrimp up to eat them. They get it eventually. Sometimes it takes a little extra effort.<br /><br />My food-motivated cat took to the treats right away. At the smell of them, she gets excited and starts pacing and can't wait to munch on them. She loves them and would eat the whole bag if I would let her!<br /><br />The second cat who is not so much food-motivated did not know what to do with them at first. She actually did not touch these treats for the first two days I used them. Just before I was about to give up, she ended up taking a nibble on one of them and has liked to eat them since. This cat will eat a couple of them with some enthusiasm but then quickly lose interest.<br /><br />I haven't tried other flavors. Overall I really like the product and would recommend it and even buy it again. For the price and the amount of treats that comes in them, I am very pleased. I feel the value is great for such a healthy treat. I am still on the look out for the one protein-based cat treat that will drive BOTH of the cats crazy and keep both of their interest consistently.

review/summary: Crunchy little shrimp treats - nothing artificial
review/text: We use these as a treat for a diabetic cat during and after testing.  They are low carb, and she really likes the light, crunchy texture.  It is hard to find a crunchy treat that is not cheap "cereal" (full of grains/filler); these make a great option for cats who do not like jerky-style treats.<br /><br />Our pickiest eater won't touch them, so they may not be a hit with every cat, but we've never found a treat she likes.<br /><br />The product has a very strong shrimp odor, but are dry to the touch and our cats don't make a mess eating them, so it really hasn't been a problem.  The zipper seal bag also seems to help keep the treats fresh.

review/summary: Awesome...mega amounts of green M&Ms...and some red ones too
review/text: Peanut M&Ms are my favorite kind, and the holiday assortment is the best...there are dark green and lighter green M&Ms, and some red ones too.  Yep, over half of the bag is green!  Repeat after me, "Green M&Ms"..."Green M&Ms"..."Green M&Ms"...<br /><br />We use Holiday M&Ms (well, just the green ones) for our family's annual Grinch party.  This is not an anti-Christmas party, it is, in fact one of our favorite holiday traditions...we all dress in green, the gals do each other's hair like Whos down in Whoville, and we eat green snacks (pickles, guacamole dip, green punch, green M&Ms, spinach dip, etc.) while we watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LOUP">Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (Widescreen Edition)</a> starring Jim Carey.  It's a blast!<br /><br />The 56 oz. bag also provides the closest thing to a bottomless pit of peanut M&M delight that you likely to find in one unit.  Of course, if you eat too many M&Ms at one time you can hit what economists call "diminishing marginal return."  That is, the first 1/4 pouund will taste great, but once you reach 1/2 pound they will probably start tasting icky...and eating more won't help.  But, if you pace yourself you can make a bag this size last a good long time!<br /><br />5 stars for quantity AND quality of one of America's favorite candy treats!

review/summary: Great tasting candy
review/text: Tootsie rolls have a unique chewy and chocolate taste that you don't find in other candies. It seems like I have been eating them forever. They last a really long time without tasting stale or getting too hard, and do not melt the way other chocolate candy does if you bring them outside to eat on a hot day (though they can get a little sticky).<br /><br />I don't see how anyone can be deceived by the word "bulk", as the negative review suggests, since these are clearly stated to be 16oz. Moreover the negative review is based solely on the price on Amazon, which admittedly is very high, rather than on the quality of the product itself, which is excellent, regardless of where you buy it. Finally, the negative reviewer has suggested in a comment (which has been deleted) that because I live in the same state as the company that makes this product, there must be some connection between me and the company. There is none.<br /><br />Shop for price. I buy these for less than half the price on Amazon at my local drugstore (CVS).

Very disappointed at how they mis-portray this as being "bulk", this is just your everyday average bag of Tootsie Rolls.

review/summary: It could have been worse....
review/text: I tend to rate dried fruit snacks on a curve due to the truly horrible similar products I've encountered in the past, otherwise this item would be a solid 2 star. That said, lets break this item down.<br /><br />FRUIT MIX: 70-75% apple with the bulk of the rest of the volume being blueberries & strawberries( I assume I ate a cherry or two, I must have, since they are pictured on the package).<br /><br />CRUNCH: You would think with these items being called crunchy fruit snacks the fruit would actually be crunchy wouldn't you? Not so, only the apples were truly crunchy, the rest of the mix having the texture and consistency of the white part of popcorn(or possibly packing peanuts?).<br /><br />FLAVOR: In this mix, only the strawberries had a strong flavor, the rest of the fruit seemed bland in comparison(to me this is a detractor,but if you like more subtle flavors this might be for you).<br /><br />ANTICIPATION(how much do I look forward to getting my next serving): On a scale of vietnamese fish sauce to german black forest cake(w/cherries) I'd give it a brussel sprouts verging on asperagushood.<br /><br />All negatives aside, though this item is not as bad as some similar products I have encountered in the past, I probably would not purchase this product again.

They are light and flavorful with "nothing else" added to the fruit (as the ingredients state).  They might take some getting used to if you are familiar with sugary (high fructose corn syrup) dried fruit, though.  They are a great addition to organic cereal and low-fat ice cream, too.  Yum!

review/text: As someone who really enjoys dried fruit, I was very excited to try this product, but I must say that I was pretty disappointed in it overall. The crunch is a great feature for a dried fruit snack; however, the flavors were not very pleasant. The berries seem to be somehow simultaneously too strong and too muddled, and as other reviewers noted, it was pretty difficult to find any cherries in the mix. I did enjoy the apples--that fruit and the true crunchiness managed to pull three stars from me--and I may try one of the apples-only packages to see how I feel about that version. Two friends who tried the snacks also deemed them "okay, but not amazing." Overall, I can only give a lukewarm recommendation for this mix...

review/text: I purchased the Cherry Berry and Orchard Blend Snacks for my 2 and 4 year old girls.  They love them! They are perfect snacks for children (all natural, no sugar added, grown in the U.S.).

I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a delicious and healthy snack!  I will definitely keep ordering these items!
