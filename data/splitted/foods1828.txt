review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: This is actually the first time I ordered the 3 grain<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S4I140">Feldkamp Three-Grain Bread , 16.75-Ounce Vacuum Packs (Pack of 12)</a> bread. Since i was not sure if the bread comes like this I did not comment on it. I actually gave half of it away as sort of "little gifts" and every body told me the same thing: The bread was brittle and sort of to wet to actually handle it. So know i got thousands of crumbs and try to figure out what to do with them. Very disappointed and would not order again.

review/text: I'm allergic to rice and it's crazy difficult to find granola bars without rice (or rice flour, etc...). And thankfully, these are my favorite flavor, peanut butter! I searched high and low for something like this and now my local Fred Meyers stopped carrying them so I had to go online. They are crunchy with a good oatmeal peanut butter taste - salty and sweet but not too sweet. Alot like Nature Valley peanut butter granola bars sans rice. Great for breakfast or to bring along on a hike. Yum!  If anyone knows of any other good rice free granola bars, let me know...  Thanks!

review/text: These are great!  Our whole family likes them.  They are wonderful as a dessert too!  Whenever I really want crunch and Peanut butter this is what I go for. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because they do have too much fat in them.  If eatting both little bars they have 9 grams.  I tend to split it w/ someone or just eat it for breakfast!  Still it is organic and does have fiber and soooo much better than a candy bar!

review/text: I start my day with one of these and a handful of almonds every workday.  I can't imagine a better way to get started.  I have food sensitivities and most granola bars can be problematic.  These bars never trigger a sensitivity.  Also, I do not get a low sugar bounceback an hour later like some of the lighter, more sugary granola bars.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, no other granola bars I have tried over the past 5 years can compare.  One thing of note is that I have noticed differences in batches where some seem better (peanut butter in greater quantity and 'wetter' vs a dry batch).  Both taste great, but the wet batches are finger lickin' good.

review/text: My sister found out about smoked paprika thanks to "Big Daddy's House" on the Food Network.  I use it constantly and find it as great a staple as garlic in cooking.  Smoked paprika indeed adds a beautiful smoked flavor to foods without the barbeque grill.<br /><br />Purchasing the small jars from the supermarket was getting too costly.  By purchasing the 1 lb. size, I have been able to refill my little supermarket spice jar at least four times with plenty over.  I am grateful to Wholespice not only for offering the paprika in bulk for an extremely reasonable price, but for their fast shipping.<br /><br />If you've never tried smoked paprika, please give it a try.  If you enjoy using it as much as I do, please buy it from Wholespice.  I truly believe that you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: My Wife's Choice for Cornbread Dressing!
review/text: In the past my wife would bake cornbread in the preparation of cornbread dressing; as a result of this more complicated alternative we didn't have cornbread dressing all that often. When I say cornbread dressing I'm referring to a stuffing mix that is served as a separate dish and never sees the insides of a turkey or chicken.<br /><br />I'll freely admit my love of cornbread dressing; I'd request my wife make an abundant supply so I could enjoy it for weeks afterward. It could even get to the point of having to freeze individual servings so they wouldn't' spoil in the refrigerator. I did and still do really enjoy cornbread dressing!<br /><br />Then we entered a new age; an age of easily and quickly prepared cornbread dressing. As you might expect my wife has never been interested in returning to the old do-it-yourself method of preparation. What is also pleasing to me, as a consumer, is the very good taste the Kraft Stove top dressing has; it doesn't leave me wishing for the old ways but is an entirely satisfactory replacement and a lot easier and faster.<br /><br />She has always cooked the dressing on the stove top in a large pan and uses around six boxes of the mix. In addition to following the directions on the side she always saut&eacute;s onions and garlic and adds that to the mix along with sliced mushrooms and chopped up giblets if available.<br /><br />The results are delicious and relatively quickly prepared. As a result we can now have cornbread dressing more often which pleases me greatly!

It pops well and tastes good. Of course, I don't actually know of any popcorn that DOESN'T pop well and taste good, unless I screw up the process. In case you're wondering about ordering this much popcorn all at once: I looked it up, and most sources say you can store unpopped popcorn for up to two years before it starts to lose moisture. You'll have to transfer this to something airtight, though; it comes in plastic bags closed with twist ties.

review/text: I picked up this box at Cracker Barrel for my fianc&eacute; since she's never had salt water taffy and it was only about five bucks. Fralinger's is supposed to be one of the best and is still produced in America. Unfortunately half the box consists of two flavors. We had a total of exactly 40 pieces, 12 of which were licorice, 8 chocolate, and the rest still only consisting of 3 or 4 flavors. Given how many different flavors are listed in the guide included in the box, we feel very cheated to have not even received most of them. The ones that are not licorice do taste pretty good and have that great taffy chew, but don't let the box get above about 75 degrees or you'll have a very difficult time separating the taffy from the wrapper.<br /><br />If you like licorice give these a try.

When I contacted Italian Products, they were courteous and apologetic and told me to discard the bottle, that they would replace it. Well, they did -- with two bottles! One was sent as a generous apology/thank you gift. These people want your business!<br /><br />Did I mention the oil? It's cold pressed and unfiltered (you can tell -- it's cloudy), young, fresh, and fruity with hints of grassiness. It  warms a little in your throat...it's delicious drizzled on greens or over soup. I haven't had it with pasta yet, but I'm sure it will be wonderful. It's a rich, assertive oil if that's what you like.<br /><br />I tell you this with great trepidation because I want to be able to keep ordering it!

review/text: Quick to make, tasty as hell. One downside is that they're packed with sodium (as most "just add water" soups are). If you're a fan of kimchi or hot and sour soup, you'll like this.<br /><br />Tip: get a turkey sandwich on white bread and dip it into the soup. Holy mother of cheap cuisine!

review/summary: So Good!
review/text: I never really liked cup noodles or bowl noodles. To me they have always tasted too plain and lacked flavor. One day my mom bought one of this product for me and told me to try it because her friend's son loves it. I was hesistant at first due to my prior experiences, but I decided to give it a shot anyways. First Impression "WOW!", and I am glad to say now I am an addict. This bowl noodle is of high quality, even if the price is low. The seasoning that is supplied, is so delicious. It is spicy, but not to the point where you will be tearing, it is just enough to give you a kick. My favorite part is the soup, it's spicy and has an amazing taste and I just cannot get enough of it. The bowl however comes with a lot of noodles, so if your not a fan of the soup you will still have a lot of noodles to munch on and after 1 bowl it should fill you up, but I am warning you now that everytime you have one of these your going to want another one right away. Overall, amazing product and I eat this very often. I usually buy it from my local grocery since it costs about 88cents per bowl and I don't have to wait for shipping.<br /><br />Just some additional information on how to prepare:<br /><br />Microwave<br />1- Open Lid halfway and fill up the bowl with water (about 3/4).<br />2 - Open the seasoning package, and pour it all in the bowl.<br />3 - Mix it up, cover the lid, and then put it in the microwave for 3 minutes.<br />4 - Once timer is up, let it sit in the oven for an additional 2-3 minutes and your ready to go!<br /><br />Boiling Water<br />1 - Boil Water<br />2 - Open Lid half way, and then open the seasoning package and pour everything in.<br />3 - Pour the boiling water into the bowl (about 3/4)<br />4 - Let it sit for about 2-3 minutes and your ready to go!<br /><br />Fun Fact - The longer you let the noodles sit in the hot water with the lid covered, the more water it will absorb, and it will lead to the noodles being thicker! So if your someone who prefers more noodles than soup, let it sit for about 5-6 minutes before you start munching.<br /><br />Let me know if my review helped! If you have any questions or comments please let me know and I will get back to you within the next day.

review/text: I like having a bowl of noodles as a bedtime snack. These are pretty filling. They're spicy, but not really hot. The only downside is that they're pretty high in sodium, but that's true with pretty much all instant ramen.<br /><br />My local big box store has these, but theirs have been hit with the grocery shrink ray and the per-unit price is a bit higher than Amazon with subscribe and save. This is a good item to stock up on. At the rate I eat them, I may end up having to get extra shipments. Om nom nom nom!!!!

review/summary: Fantastic Blend for Fast Growth....
review/text: REVISION: Below I said to stop using Nitrogen later in the season, but I have had to adapt that recommendation.  Over the last two years, early blight has stricken tomatoes nation wide, including places where it was relatively rare like New England.  Entire farms have been wiped out, especially organic farms.<br /><br />Early blight can be treated with a fungicide, but you need new stem and leaf growth to compensate for the leaves and stems lost to blight.  You will have a smaller crop at the end, but losing the plant will result in many fewer tomatoes.<br /><br />I found after several of my plants succumed to blight (no tomatoes, a couple of branches of leaves, etc.) that providing the rest a good dose of late season nitrogen helped them enormously.<br /><br />So, I would suggest now, until the early blight has run its course (maybe never) you should use Miracle Grow Tomato Plant Fool all season and don't try to overinduce the flowering and yield of your tomatoe plants.  Two live healthy plants with average yield are way better than one dead one killed off by blight.<br /><br />Watch for youtubegarden.com, for more info.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I always plant with manure (raked into the soil, about one 25 pound bag of dehydrated manure per 10 plants, about 2 feet apart and spaced 3 feet per row) and some fresh garden top soil (just placed in the hole where the plant is, not throughout the garden).<br /><br />If you remember, it is good to mix in lime as well about a month or so before you put the tomatoes in the ground.  It helps by providing calcium to the plants and helps prevent blossom end rot.  Although, I rarely have had any problem with that here, it can depend on your soil, so better safe than sorry.  If you forget, don't worry, things will work fine without it for the most part.<br /><br />I plant the tomatoes deep, relative to the size of the plant.  1/3 down into the soil or more depending on the size.  Before I do I place fresh garden top soil in the hole and water it.  Then I place the plant firmly in the muddy mixture and surround it with more fresh garden top soil.  I have not found that different brands of gardening soil are better, so any cheap bag at your local gardening shop will do.  I have never lost a plant doing this.  People talk about other ideas like using 80 degree water to water the plants or using special techniques to keep from hurting the plants.  But I have never used any technique like this.  Hose water is fine as is rain water.<br /><br />I do not fertilize my tomatoes until a couple of weeks have passed and they have rooted and grown a bit.  I let the manure, new garden soil and lime do the job.<br /><br />After that, every two weeks, I apply Miracle Gro, and when I do, the plants are more vigorous, grow faster and I have fewer problems with the plants such as discolorations of the leaves or bug infestations.  I have heard numerous folks say to use less or more than the directions, but you know, the 1 Table Spoon per Gallon of water always has worked for me.  About a gallon for every three plants when they are young.  A bit more when they get to be 2 feet or more.  The box does twenty plants for the period of the season I use it.<br /><br />I use a bucket or watering can for mixing.  I have not had good luck with the automatic dispensers attach to the end of the hose and it seems to waste fertilizer.  But your mileage may vary.<br /><br />When the plants first start to show fruit and have reached about 3 feet, I stop using Miracle Gro and switch to a no-nitrogen fertilizer.  I find that by the time the plants are 3 feet tall, their root growth is fantastic and their leaf production is strong, so I want to focus on flowering and fruit production.  Something that reads 0-10-10 or even higher is fine.  Just absolutely no nitrogen.<br /><br />I have tried other fertilizers for my plants.  Nothing has worked better than Miracle Gro and some brands seemed to not work at all.  I have always been satisfied with Miracle Gro and stick to it for great tomatoes and strong plants.

review/summary: South African Secret.
review/text: South Africans are as avid tea drinkers as the inhabitants of any other country (formerly) belonging to the British Commmonwealth - today, consumption averages about 10 billion cups per year - and tea was first grown in Durban Botanical Gardens in 1850 from plants imported from London's Kew Gardens (commercial production began in 1877, with seeds from Assam). Yet, production around the major tea center of Tzaneen in the Northern Province (formerly known as North-East Transvaal) as well as in the country's other tea growing locations has had an unstable history; staggering badly in the mid-twentieth century and although revived thereafter, available only domestically during apartheid. Only after apartheid ended, South African tea farmers were able to export their products. Hence, black tea from South Africa is still a fairly well-kept secret; although roughly 40% of the country's tea is now sold on the world market and it is already among the world's top 20 tea-producing nations.<br /><br />Harvested before the beginning of the winter cool, between October and April, a tea fairly well-known outside South Africa is that produced by the Ntingwe Estate located in a remote corner of the Kwazulu-Natal heartland. Established in 1987 and with over 200 permanent employees, 430 seasonal pickers as well as a program involving the cooperation of local farmers with the estate's on-site processing plant, Ntingwe is *the* single biggest employer and source of financial stability in a region otherwise plagued by record unemployment numbers (up to 60%), illiteracy and poverty. Lighter than other African (e.g. Kenyan) teas, Ntingwe tea has gained an excellent reputation in the short time since its introduction to the international market and makes for as great a breakfast tea as an afternoon refreshment or a pick-me-up throughout the day.

Even though this isn't marked as "fair trade" this is pretty much as fair trade as you can get. So, not only does it taste delicious but you can feel good about where its coming from too.

review/summary: The BEST!
review/text: We are on a NO MONSANTO diet, so we seek out organic grains that are not grown with Monsanto's Frankinseeds. Plus we seek organic whenever possible because we believe they are healthier and we know they taste better. This popcorn is wonderful. It pops up light and flavorful with a deep old fashioned popcorn taste that modern popcorn can't touch. After eating Amish popcorn for so long, I began to doubt my tastebuds. Is it really that good? I thought. So I tried some Orville R. I popped in my regular way and I tried some microwave. Both tasted like salty styrofoam compared. There IS a difference.<br /><br />Tips:<br /> We don't like air popcorn so I use a round, domed popcorn maker, I think Amazon sells it. Use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. It is outstanding, and tastes like movie popcorn did a long time ago. I was told that before coconut oil became a health food fad, it was dirt cheap and that movies used it to pop their popcorn (when they used to have giant popcorn machines in the theater). I also use butter sometimes. Yeah, it's me and Julia Child against the world.<br /><br />For another really good taste, sprinkle on Spike instead of salt. It's amazing.<br /><br />Use popcorn salt instead of regular. It is finer and sticks to the popcorn better. I take Kosher salt and put it into a coffee grinder (not used for coffee) to make popcorn salt, but you can buy it, maybe from Amazon. I haven't checked.<br /><br />Keep the popcorn you are not going to use within a couple of months, in the freezer so they don't dry out. Dried out kernels don't pop very well.

review/summary: Not nearly as good as regular Orville Redenbacher's
review/text: We make popcorn 2-3 times a week, on the stovetop using coconut oil.  We typically use Redenbacher, but are always interested in finding something better or more interesting.  This is not it.<br /><br />First of all, the unpopped kernel sizes vary widely, compared to Redenbacher where they are roughly uniform.  There is also a great deal of popcorn dust in the bags - loose husks, kernel bits, etc.  Neither would be deal killers if the popcorn was good.<br /><br />But it isn't.  It pops very unevenly, some are fluffy and light, others are harder and chewy, some are half-popped, and it leaves many more unpopped and half-popped kernels than Redenbacher.<br /><br />Also note that per Amazon policy, this item is not returnable, so we'll eventually work our way through all six bags, but we won't enjoy it very much.

review/summary: Our favorite popcorn-by far
review/text: We have had popcorn every night for well over 10 years and we have tried many varieties.  We used to like Jolly Time, until we tried Amish Country Medium Yellow popcorn.  We love this particular one.  We have also tried different varieties from Amish Country, but this is by far our favorite.  What I like best about this particular popcorn is that it pops into large kernels, and we have very few that don't pop.  There is the occasional hull present, but certainly nothing to complain about, as they are few and far between.  We pop this popcorn in a hot air popper because we eat so much of it, we can't afford the extra fat and calories that would come from having large quantities of popcorn prepared with oil.  I strongly recommend this popcorn.  When we can't get this particular brand and variety, it is very disappointing, as we feel nothing compares to the size and flavor of this particular popcorn.

review/text: I don't know why the stores around here carry all the other flavors of Trident White.  I see bubblegum, the yellow one with Pineapple but not cinnamon.<br />And only Trident White has the flavor that lasts with the added benefit of helping my teeth.<br />The major time I chew gum is in my car, especially when I'm in traffic.  Even though I live in Texas, with the coating it stays in great shape in a tin inside my car even through the summer.<br />Thank you TRIDENT!!

review/summary: Great for Pistachio Ice Cream
review/text: I bought this Pistachio Nut Paste to make ice cream because the Bronte pistachio cream from Italy was not available at the time, and this seemed like a reasonable substitute - plus, it's made in the U.S. My ice cream maker is an attachment to my Oster Kitchen Center and uses ice and salt for freezing. The basic ice cream recipe yields a quart and a half, using 4 cups of heavy cream and/or half and half, plus a cup of sugar and whatever flavorings are needed. I mixed the cream, then began adding the Pistachio Nut Paste using a hand mixer, checking the flavor as I went along. I ended up using the entire can, plus another quarter cup of sugar and a teaspoon of almond extract, before I got a taste that was sweet enough, but not too sweet to drown out the savory pistachio flavor. Into that mixture, when it was beginning to freeze in the ice cream maker, I added a cup and a quarter of shelled, toasted, and chopped pistachios. I served this ice cream at a dinner party the next day, and every single person there asked for seconds. I will definitely be buying this product again. One important note: You must thoroughly stir this product when you first open it to reincorporate the canola and pistachio oil that separates from the paste after it is canned. The oil adds to the smoothness of the paste and should not be thrown away, although it does take some elbow grease to stir it back in.

review/summary: Great tea but you need to know how to brew
review/text: This is great tea, but you need to know how to brew it. There is a viedo on Youtube. Westerners let it steep for 3 minutes creating bitter taste at times. You should pluck some of the cake 2 teaspoons of dry leaves, put it in a cup, pour hot boiling water on it, let it soak for 10-20 seconds then discard the "first tea" prepare your serving cups, pour fresh boiling water over perviously steeped leaves let it steep for 20-30 seconds then strain tea into serving cups. make sure all the water is gone and none left in the leaves as this will oversteep the tea. You can re steep the leaves up to 8 times.<br />great health benefits, enjoy.

review/summary: Simply the best tea I ever drank
review/text: I just received this tea after waiting only 2 days, that is amazing.<br />I could not wait to try it so I followed the other reviewers' advice and washed it first. Etc. Etc.<br />Now I am not saying anyone is wrong by any means but I tried it both ways, washing and not washing and I cannot tell the difference.<br />To me I believe it is a waste of tea to wash it, in fact I found a lovely video that may be very interesting to some of you it is only 5 minutes this man is Dr. Tea he has written a book and has a shop and sells teas. He is basically an expert and he does not wash his tea.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I did however make a nice ritual out of the making of the tea.  I had the opportunity to purchase an authentic tea pot along with all the extras that I found is needed to make a good tea, I got it from China Town in California, and I used it the proper way for the first time today, it was relaxing and fun.<br /><br />I was not aware of all the health properties in this particular tea, the list is impressive, heart problems, high blood pressure, cholesterol, it helps with teeth and gum problems and promotes its healing, it is also a weight reduction tea, but what I needed it for is the Theanine that is in this tea, I have an autoimmune disease that causes inner tremors and I take L-theanine to calm me down but this tea is doing that in a more natural way.  I will no longer be needing to purchase this supplement. This also is a tea that has very little caffeine and it did not make me nervous like the average teas do.<br />I do recommend this tea to everyone especially if you have any of these problems, but for me I enjoyed a very restful day without any jitters.<br /><br />As for the cost, this morning I cut off 2 grams of the tea and I am just finishing it, you can brew this tea many many times as you can see in the video, this makes it, for me, a very inexpensive tea. It will last forever even if I use it on a daily basis which I now intend to do.

review/summary: A Great Pu-erh the first time...
review/text: "The pu-erh received was lovely. It was aged, ripe pu-erh that had a distinctive honey taste and smell. Very enjoyable!"<br /><br />That is what I wrote the first time I bought this pu-erh. Though I didn't recognize the maker of the tea, at least the box it came in matched the pictured tea on Amazon. The tea tasted great.  I thought that I would get another- but what arrived was totally different.  Different producer and different quality. I would not buy from this source again, as there is no mention of the producer of the tea and no clear description of the<br />tea, as what area in China that it comes from or year it was produced. The first bing-cha was a good value for the money. I'm not sure I can say the same about the second bing-cha.

review/text: I have been having two different brands of Pu-Erh tea that my friend hand carried from China since last year. They taste very smooth and gentle to the stomach that I enjoy very much. I started to look for more Pu-Erh tea online as I was running out of them. I saw this brand online and gave it a try. Unfortunately, this Pu-Erh tea tastes just like Lipton type of black tea. It does not taste like good Pur-Erh tea and does stimulate my stomach a bit. I was quite disappointed!

review/summary: Don't Be Afraid to Try It
review/text: OMG. I am SO relieved. I've just taken my first few sips and I HAD to come and post a review. I've had this tea sitting around for weeks, frankly out of fear of it's taste. I read the reviews here and in other places. Descriptions like "earthy" and "mushroom" had me gagging at the thought of drinking the tea. I do NOT like mushrooms and "earthy" is a very vague description.<br /><br />That being said (this review is strictly about the taste. I will post later if I truly notice any health benefits) there is a subtle taste it that can only be described as earthy. Probably the way you'd imagine tree bark to taste. Not horrible, but nothing to drool about. I don't taste mushroom at all. The flavor is SUPER mild. It's not strong so it's almost pleasant to drink. Although the tree bark doesn't make my taste buds do a happy dance, I'm not gagging. I didn't need to add sweetener to my tea, and I can drink this every morning from now on with no problem. I have been trying to wean myself from coffee to tea and this is a good compromise IF it can wake me up in the mornings. The earthiness of the tea almost gives the satisfaction of drinking a cup of coffee that's not quite sweet enough. If you don't like sweetener in your coffee, you will probably enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I didn't time the brew. I have one of those 16 oz insulated cups with the tea diffuser inside. I filled the diffuser (not sure if it holds 1 oz. or 2) and I put hot water in the cup. I gave it 2-3 minutes then poured out the (light reddish) water and put in new water. It immediately became dark red. About 3-5 minutes later, I threw away the tea leaves.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I made mine too weak since I used a big cup. Maybe I should let it steep for 6-10 minutes? Also, I have to check to see if I used enough...or even too much tea. I'll play with it to make sure I'm getting the maximum health benefit but for now, don't be afraid to taste it! It's not horrible. No lingering after taste. If you don't like it, you'll forget it within 30 seconds of having tasted it.<br /><br />Go ahead, take the chance.

review/summary: Great impression of first time Pu Erh drinker
review/text: I just got the package a few minutes ago and just started my first brew. I followed the traditional procedure of rinsing the Pu Erh with boiling water for 20 seconds and throwing out the rinse. The first infusing which is the one I'm currently drinking while reviewing was a 20 second brew as well. This tea is very mellow and I'd imagine very hard to make bitter due to the fermentation process, it has strong woody presence, both scent and taste, reminiscent of green rooibos. I would definitely buy this again.. now back to tasting the tea.<br /><br />with 5.2 grams(Messured with a scale) I've just broken off gently with my hands, since I have no proper tools. A 150ml tea cup is used to measure the boiling water and drink from.<br />..<br />edit: Second, Third, and Fourth infusion have all been the same, no compromise to the complexity and only a very slight hint of bitterness on the  fourth, which was a 35 second brew, the longest....I'm going to go as high as 7 infusions.<br /><br />This tea packaging wrap has a date of 2007, so pretty decent aging.

This is great because I can be a stress queen and it explains why it does not make me jittery.  To see how strong it gets would make you think it would, but it is not bitter either. I bought this tea because of the health benefits so I am going to stick with it.  Health benefits or not, if I didn't like the taste I wouldn't drink it!

review/summary: Yunnan pu-erh Tea
review/text: After reading reviews and watching You Tube Chinese brewing methods I have found the instuctions on the pkg. to be adequate (2gm. in a cup of boiling water for 3 min.)  If you want to rinse it for 20 seconds and discard this first steep like the chinese ritual then rinse it.  I think rinsing doesn't clean the tea it may be a rehydrating process.  After all, this is a fermented tea and all the benefits of the fermentation process shouldn't be washed and discarded.  Keep in mind that the Chinese make teeny tiny cups of tea at a time so the steeping lengths are measured in seconds.  I make 16oz.at a time in a large mug so I put 4gm. of tea in a tea ball and steep in boiling water (just let it sit there) for 3 min. then set aside the tea ball for the next steep in 16oz. of boiling water for 3-5 min.  Color is the best way to tell the strength and steep time if it takes 30 seconds or 3 minutes.

review/summary: Great tea
review/text: I like the taste of Oolong tea.  This is along the same lines as far as taste, but much darker and flavorful.  I personally can drink it without sweetening it, but I still do add some sweetner.<br /><br />I have seen ways to prepare it on youtube, but I guess I do my own thing.<br /><br />I have a small 12 oz cup with a strainer.  I break up a relatively small portion and run hot water through it.  I immediately dump it out.  Some of the fine particles wash out and the tea is very light.  I let it sit damp for a while (most of the time overnight).  It seems that since the tea is now soaked, I can pour hot water over the tea leaves/stems and immediately remove the strainer (and consume).  I can do this 2 more times that same way as the same batch.  On the fourth time, I let it steep a few minutes to get the last bit out and then discard the used up tea leaves.<br /><br />I have heard that there are some health benefits from drinking this tea.  I cannot comment one way or another as I have not noticed anything.  I like the taste and the pick me up.  I usually have 2 cups a day between breakfast and lunch.  I like my sleep, so I personally wouldn't drink it too late in the day.  I also don't get too jittery like drinking a Venti Tarbucks.<br /><br />Enjoy!

Then, I rinse this in my infuser with freshly boiled water. I then steep the tea in freshly boiled water for the following times:<br />1st infusion: 65 seconds<br />2nd infusion: 75 seconds<br />3rd infusion: 95 seconds<br />4th infusion: 210 seconds<br /><br />The first two infusions taste pretty strong, the third is noticeably weakening and the fourth is about half as strong as the first.

review/summary: What Happened to BC Mashed Potatoes?
review/text: I remember when Betty Crocker introduced this line of mashed potatoes. They became a family favorite and every variety was good. Well it had been a few years since I had eaten them and decided to try the Original again and the Loaded flavor which is a new addition. What happened? Ever since Betty Crocker changed the packaging and cooking directions on their products the quality and taste has gone down hill. I'm seeing it across the board: complaints about the cake mixes, tuna and hamburger helpers, and now the instant potatoes. I tried making the Original potatoes 4 different times, trying to figure out the right ratio of water milk and butter, and each time the bits of parsley were like hard little bumps in the potatoes. They used to be soft and meld in with the potatoes. Couldn't get the mixture to the right consistency. The Loaded variety has a faint salty cheese taste. That's it. Not enough bacon bits like what's pictured on the box. Betty Crocker's directions are a joke. They are slowly but surely killing their reputation. Zero stars for the oringinal mashed varieties, two for Loaded, and that's being generous.

review/summary: Soy
review/text: I want to point out that the description says "no soy" but soy is the second ingredient. This is very misleading.

review/summary: Tastes like homemade
review/text: This is the closest to homemade that you're going to get. This soup is veryyyyy good. It's not overly salty like Campbells and it doesn't taste fake and gross, it literally tastes like you made it yourself. The noodles are thick and firm, the carrots are abundant and the chicken comes in thick cubed pieces. I'm not a big fan of Progresso soups but this one is a winner.

review/summary: Love my KCups
review/text: Great coffee, great price, fast shipping. Can't always find my coffee in the grocery store and when I do it is only 1 or 2 boxes there and it's only boxes of 18 and I am always running out.  I can order and have it here in a couple days and at a cheaper price than I am paying in the stores.  Now I have my coffee anytime I want it.

review/text: We try to eat healthy at home, and this oil fits right into that (I am the chef of the household).  I have replaced all of my oils with this one single product.  I use it for cooking, baking, frying, everything!  Light taste and has low saturated fat...could not ask for a better oil.

review/summary: Gift that was well recieved.
review/text: This was a gift for my wife.  She really enjoyed these, found them to be very tasty.  She also liked that they are portion controlled, making it easier to not eat all of them at one time.<br /><br />I thought they were a bit pricey for what I got, but they did the job, and my wife was very please.
