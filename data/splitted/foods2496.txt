review/summary: Great coffee for the Keurig!
review/text: This is a nice mild morning cup of coffee.  It is smooth and tasty.  I usually use it with the Keurig on the setting that gives the largest cup of coffee.  If you want it stronger, you can just adjust and use the middle setting for cup size.

review/summary: Great tasting coffee!
review/text: I love a nice smooth coffee that is a light to medium roast.  This is actually my favorite!  The only thing I can say about this specific product on Amazon is that it's definitely not a great deal/value.  After getting the product and breaking down the price, it was pretty much the same amount I pay for it at Publix or any other grocery store.

review/summary: Just when I thought it couldn't get any better than Caribou's signature blend, along comes Daybreak!
review/text: When I picked up a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, I really thought I'd found the best good-cuppa-coffee to please everyone in our household. Caribou is a coffee company that is very popular in Chicago and are known for producing great quality coffee. With their reputation, I've always been eager to try the other blends that are available in k cup form, but they are often hard to come by.<br /><br />I ordered a 5 k cup sampler size of this blend directly for Keurig because I was so happy with the Caribou Blend that I couldn't wait to try the company's other offerings. I'm so thankful I did, because the Daybreak Morning Blend just hit the original blend out the park!<br /><br />I enjoy a medium roast with a kick. Just because I don't like a dark, bitter cup of coffee doesn't mean I want to skimp on flavor or aroma. And Caribou Daybreak really delivers in both of those departments. This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop. It goes great with a little skim milk, too. A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us. So we have to order it online, which seems a little pricier (surprisingly). Oh well, I still think this blend is completely worth it. It's my new go-to k cup!

review/text: I bought my wife a Keurig machine a year ago and we've tried a lot of cases of coffees, teas, apple cider, hot chocolate... you name it and we've probably tried it.<br /><br />So far, this is one of our all time favorite coffees.  It's rich, has a wonderful aroma, and it's flavorful without being bitter.<br /><br />It's a little stronger than Coffee People Donut Shop but just about that same type of coffee.  We love them both as do many of our guests and visitors.

review/summary: Best coffee we have found
review/text: My fiance and I dont seem to like the dark roast coffees and medium roast k cups (except for the Dunkin Donuts one) that much so when we say this at the grocery store and saw that it was a  light blend that we hadn't tried yet we figured why not. We are glad we did.<br /><br />This coffee smells so good when it is brewing so we knew that was a good sign when we made it later that night after we got home shopping. Then we tried it and basically fell in love with it and don't drink anything else now in the mornings. We do have an iced coffee that is different on the weekend but that's another review.<br /><br />I highly recomend this coffee to anyone who like us feels that the bold and medium roasts are just too strong. This isn't at all and is just an all around very good tasting coffee.

review/text: The Caribou Coffee is of course equal and the same as any I could buy in a store or at any other on-line vendor.  The time it took to get to me was unacceptable though.  I will not be ordering my coffee from this vendor again.  I opted to pay for speedier shipping although I was eligible for the free Super Saver on this item, because I knew I would soon be running out of coffee at home.  I then received a notice of a shipping date that was almost 2 weeks from order date!  I had to then take my time and get stressed arguing with them about the fact that I'd paid extra for expidited shipping. I did get my shipping fees refunded, but not my coffee sooner.  So I had to then go out to a store to purchase coffee to use until the order from Amazon finally arrived, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place by placing the order on line.  Not a happy camper on this one!

Their growth to a nationwide brand is well-earned...this is by far the best Kettle Corn out there.  What makes the difference is not only their perfect blend of flavors, but the high quality of the corn itself...big, fluffy, and crunchy.  This new Cheddar Kettle Corn is TO DIE FOR.  It's sweet, it's salty, it's cheesy...it's perfect!  Get yourself some of this stuff (I call it "Cheddle Corn") and you will have your new snacking addiction...it's pretty much impossible to stop eating until you've finished off the bag in one sitting.  You'll see.

review/summary: Best litterbox I have used hands down.
review/text: I have owned 3 of these with 4 different large (up to 16 lbs) cats and a variety of litter types.  I would like to echo Esther G.'s review - this box is amazing if used "correctly"!!<br /><br />I'll try and explain another way for the sake of repetition.<br /><br />This system comes with 2 bottoms: at any time one bottom contains the litter (let's call this the "active box") and the other is empty (the "standby box").  The boxes fit inside of eachother so the standby is stored below the active box.  In fact, the lid won't seal properly unless the boxes and sifter are all stacked together in a nice package.<br /><br />There are two major ways to use the system - the NASTY WAY and the AWESOME WAY:<br /><br />********<br />NASTY WAY (most people do this):<br />Most everyone leaves the sifter inside the active box so that the litter itself is sitting inside the sifter.  The sifter, in turn, sits inside the active box.  From top to bottom we have:<br /><br />SIFTER (contains litter)<br />ACTIVE<br />STANDBY<br /><br />When it's time to change the litter, people simply pull the sifter out and dump the contents into the trash.  The sifter then goes into the standby box and the (cleaned) litter is dumped from one box to the other.  What was previously the active box is now the standby box and everything gets re-stacked like before.<br /><br />This is the most obvious way and I think the product literature even suggests this.  However, there is a small gap between the sifter and active box which leaves room for liquid to gather below (and around) the sifter.  Clumping litter will clump *around* the holes in the sifter and create clogs.  This also allows for some small clumps to gather on the inside walls of the box - these get smeared over time.  After a week or two, you're left with a messy, stinky box and a sifter that needs lots of attention.<br />********<br /><br />********<br />AWESOME WAY (everyone should do this):<br /><br />You can eliminate the clumping inside the sifter if you don't leave the sifter sitting in the litter!!<br /><br />You can order the boxes like this:<br /><br />ACTIVE (contains litter)<br />SIFTER<br />STANDBY<br /><br />When it's time to clean, you simply pull the active box out and pour its contents (including clumped waste) into the sifter (which is sitting inside the standby box).  Next, you pull the sifter out like you would have done for the NASTY WAY.  The sifter now contains all the waste but, since it hasn't been sitting in the waste, doesn't have any clumps or clogs!!  Throw away the waste, put the sifter into the empty box, and stack everything up.  Voila!  You're done.<br />********<br /><br />I have 2 cats sharing 1 of these boxes.  I can completely clean the box in less than 1 minute using this method.  This allows me to clean the box every day without trouble.  I change out the litter once every few weeks, rub down the insides every few months and do a deep clean maybe twice a year.<br /><br />That's seriously low maintenance and I have the cleanest box of anyone I know!! That includes those with fancy auto-cleaning systems!

review/summary: a must have for owners of many cats
review/text: I love this litter box.  It lets me finish my most dreaded chore (cleaning six litter boxes for four cats) in only a few minutes.  And since the chore now has less dread associated with it, I'm likely to do it more often (like I'm supposed to), which makes it easier still (and makes for happier kitties!).  I dread cleaning every litter box other than these, so I'm in the process of replacing all of our litter boxes with this type.<br /><br />My only major complaint is that I can't find it (or something like it) in an extra large size, and one of our cats really needs an extra large litter box (he sometimes misses when he uses the smaller boxes).<br /><br />Is it something you should buy?  I don't know.  Please read the other (less positive) reviews.  The complaints that others have are real.  My wife has similar complaints, and doesn't really like these boxes.  But it's my job to clean the kitty litter, so this is my review.  ;-)  I've dealt with a couple of mechanical self-cleaning litter boxes in the past, and keeping them clean was far more of a hassle than this litter box.<br /><br />One reviewer mentioned that "tipping it over even a large trash receptacle is awkward and messy."  I have a different approach: once the litter has been sifted, I place the tray (with the waste) into the empty pan, and place the entire thing into the mouth of a large garbage bag before pouring it out.  There's no mess at all with this strategy.<br /><br />The slots in the sifting pan *do* get clogged if your cat pees a lot.  I solve this by banging the tray and empty pan against the wall or floor a couple of times (while inside the garbage bag), and it always gets out the wet litter.  It also helps if you put a thin layer of baking soda on the bottom after most cleanings (before adding back the litter).  Since the large clumps wet litter is less likely break up while sifting with this tray than when sifting with a scoop, the litter also stays cleaner for longer.<br /><br />A minor complaint: the swinging door is flimsy and was both too stiff (so the cats tended to avoid that box) and it kept falling off, so I just pulled it off.<br /><br />I haven't used the "Omega Paw Self Cleaning Litter Box" (probably linked under "What Do Customers Ultimately Buy After Viewing This Item?").  But I'll be buying one of those soon, to compare, because they have such positive reviews.

review/summary: DO NOT use with pine pellets!
review/text: I got this box as an experiment for use with a type of Pine Pellet litter. For anyone who uses pine pellet litter, we know it does wonders to get rid of tracking issues and smells great, but the urine breaks the pellets down into a soggy and smelly sawdust. I didn't want to buy the Feline Pine sifting box because it lacks a hood. My room mates have dogs who like to go after the "kitty crunchies", and having a hood greatly reduces odor and the unwanted sight of your beloved pet taking a deuce in the middle of your apartment's kitchen.<br /><br />Anyway, my thinking was I could fill this with the pellets and sift out the urine soaked sawdust while the pellets remained on top, and scoop the solid waste.<br /><br />Bad idea. The holes are JUST too big to keep the pellets from sifting through. So don't bother if you're thinking this is the miracle solution like I did.<br /><br />So I bit the bullet and bought a Breeze system, which I will be using with the pine pellets instead of the type that comes with it. I'm going to try and jerry rig the hood of this litter box on top of the Breeze which has similar measurements.<br /><br />God help me. God help us all.<br /><br />Update: The breeze system was a complete fail. I do not recommend it at all.

review/summary: good-but not perfect
review/text: This system of litter box cleaning is much better than scooping by hand, especially with multiple cats.  However, as all things, it's not perfect.  Some of the clumps do get stuck in the sifter (especially when urine is fresh) and I end up having to wipe down anyway.  Outside of buying an electronic self-cleaning litter box (about which I've not read great things), this systems does the job pretty painlessly.

review/summary: Not quite worth it
review/text: When I first saw this in the store I thought it was a great idea and a possible time saver, even at the higher price than other traditional litter boxes. The extra money would be worth the time saving. When I brought it home and started to use it I was disappointed.<br /><br />First, the grate holes in the sifting screen are too large and so much of the smaller clumps fall through you have to scoop anyway. The clumps that fall through are so small that they fall through a regular hand-held scoop as well, I had to find a strainer that would work.  Also, the grate gets easily clogged and you have to clear it out.  The other thing that I find really annoying is that the lid system does not seal well so litter was falling out the back as my cat tossed litter around in the box.  This added a chore that I never had before, cleaning in back of the litter box.<br /><br />All in all I don't think this product has saved me any time or made the job of cleaning out the box any easier.  It actually created more work. I will replace it with a traditional litter box and send this one to the recycling bin.  I really would not recommend it.

review/summary: Works great if you use it right
review/text: I'm buying a second of these boxes, as we've added another cat to our family.  My 11-year-old son is in charge of keeping the boxes clean, and this box makes it easy for him.  As other reviewers have said, the clumps do tend to get stuck in the sifter, and it can be messy to dispose of the waste.  However, after some experimentation, we have found the solution to both problems.  First, store the sifter in the empty pan, and NOT in the pan with the litter (when stacked, the sifter should always be in the center of the stack).  When it is time to clean the box (preferably not when there are fresh clumps, as they will break if you don't give them a little time to harden), dump all the soiled litter into the second pan with the sifter in it (if any clumps are stuck to the bottom, it is easy to knock them off).  Then, lift the sifter to remove all the waste.  Slip the whole sifter directly into a cheap 10-gallon wastebasket liner, and dump the waste into the bag.  Finally, remove the sifter from the bag, put it into the newly empty pan, and place under the pan that now contains the litter.  The whole process takes my son about two minutes, and he has no problems.  He's used the scooping method before, and much prefers this box.

review/summary: best closed litter box i've ever had
review/text: this is a very good litter box for people that live in a small apartment or house, where there isn't much separation between the location of the box and the living area. the topper and flap keep the smell *very* contained, and the sifter makes it really easy to clean and change. my one complaint is that sometimes (and somewhat counterintuitively) the clumping kind of litter will get stuck and clog up the sifter, so it actually works much better (for me) to use the very cheapest *non*-clumping litter i can find. i give this product a 4, rather than 5, star review because the cheap litter is dusty and makes putting new litter into the box sort of annoying. other than that, it's really a great product and has made my cat's presence much more tolerable for my roommate, hehe

review/summary: Pleasently Surprised
review/text: I have used a sifting litter pan before, but it was a more shallow tray type than this one.  I didn't much care for it b/c of the sticking to the grate problem others have mentioned.  I do not find I have that problem with this pan.  (I've also wised up about how I use the pan)<br /><br />Some things I do to make it work best for me:<br /><br />I make sure to keep enough litter in the pan - as long as the litter is deep enough, the cats don't dig down to the sifting part and cause clumps to stick to it.<br /><br />I always sift the pan in the afternoon or evening, never in the morning or right after they eat.  I find the cats always go use the box in the morning, and one always goes after he eats.  As long as I don't clean at this time, I almost never have a "still-wet clump" problem.<br /><br />In the end, I clean this box as often as it SHOULD be cleaned because it is so easy, and that is the ultimate reason I bought it.  For that reason alone, I am happy.<br /><br />One of my cats is fairly large, and I have no doubt he would appreciate a little bit bigger box.  This is the reason I took off one star.

review/summary: Not a fan
review/text: I thought this would be a great way to avoid scooping out solid waste. It's a decent concept, but it's poorly executed. The slots in the sifting pan are easily clogged if your cat pees a lot, which mine does. I've tried keeping the litter level higher to no avail. When the sifting pan gets wet litter stuck in it, then emptying it becomes a GIANT mess- worse than any traditional scooping litter box (the kind I was trying to get away from) made. To be honest, it made a giant mess whether there was wet litter stuck in it or not- the sifting pan is very large, so tipping it over even a large trash receptacle is awkward and messy. I would sooner use a traditional scooping litter box.

review/text: I've got a decent sized cat, 16 pounds but has a long build. He's taken to this box pretty well, sometimes when he uses it he has to stick his head out of the door though.<br /><br />Regardless, the box functions well. I also recommend using it the way others suggest on here: do not use the box with the sifter already in it... use the box as normal. Then, when cleaning, dump the box into the other pan containing the sifter. Lift out the sifter, along with the waste, and dispose of the waste, then return the sifter into the empty box for storage on the bottom.<br /><br />Worth the money, good build quality, and provides privacy for my buddy when he's doing his business.

review/text: I wish I had thought about this purchase a little longer. It takes a large space to work on the sifting, the clumps have to be dumped from a large container into a trash bag, then the litter from one large container to another, after the sifter is reinserted. Clear enough if you look at the picture, yet I didn't really think it through. It is hard to do without spillage, and so can be pretty  messy and it seems like a major operation. I'm currently using sifting liners inserted into this contraption and ignoring its sifting capabilities altogether. I find them much easier. And, they keep the box clean. In this, you can't really use a liner and now there are three large pieces that need to be cleaned.

review/text: I loved the concept of this but it is messy. I got litter all over the floor when I was tipping it into the garbage sack, bits stick in the mesh and some fall out unexpectedly, and then you have to pour the remaining (dirty) litter into the other pan to get it on top of the mesh again - which releases dust, smells disgusting and just isn't a clever thing to do.

review/summary: Great litter box
review/text: This is a great litter box to have in a multi-cat household. It is extremely hardy and easy to clean. All four cats love this litter box and the filter keeps unpleasant odors out. The only problem I ran into is that one of my cats loves to dig. No matter how much litter I put in the box he always digs until he hits plastic and then cements the litter to the box. This of course makes the shifter completely USELESS in ANY combination with the two pans. So if your cat is obsessed with digging, this is not the box for you. If your cat is fairly normal she'll love this box and so will you!

review/summary: Love this litter box!!
review/text: My family recently adopted a 2 month old kitten and his 1 yr old mom from our local Humane Society. I haven't had cats for many years and forgot how messy a typical litter box can get. The first week they were here we had a small open litter box which meant I had to spend at least 30 mins a day and night scooping the litter then cleaning the floor where the majority of the litter would fall.<br /><br />2 days ago we went to Wal-Mart and bought the Van Ness Enclosed Cat box and it was the best $25 I've ever spent on a pet. The first thing I did when I got home was to put it together the way the instructions said but after reading a review here on Amazon telling us to put the sifter UNDER the active box and not on top, I re-arranged it. This method prevents the sifter from getting clogged and it also saves you money on clumping litter. It works flawlessly! I've cleaned it every morning since I bought it and it only takes me 1 minute and I don't even have to use the scooper.<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone with a cat or kitten. It's very reasonably priced, it's good quality material, and it's super easy to maintain. Even the filters are only $1 and are changed every 3 months

review/summary: BEST LITTER BOX EVER
review/text: ANY BODY WHO IS THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS BOX SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING POSTED ON 1/4/2011 BY BOBAROO, IT SAYS IT ALL, HANDS DOWN!<br /><br />5.0 out of 5 stars Best litterbox I have used hands down., January 4, 2011<br />By bobaroo - See all my reviewsThis review is from: Van Ness CP66 Enclosed Sifting Cat Pan/Litter Box, Large (Misc.)<br /><br />I have owned 3 of these with 4 different large (up to 16 lbs) cats and a variety of litter types. I would like to echo Esther G.'s review - this box is amazing if used "correctly"!!<br /><br />I'll try and explain another way for the sake of repetition.<br /><br />This system comes with 2 bottoms: at any time one bottom contains the litter (let's call this the "active box") and the other is empty (the "standby box"). The boxes fit inside of eachother so the standby is stored below the active box. In fact, the lid won't seal properly unless the boxes and sifter are all stacked together in a nice package.<br /><br />There are two major ways to use the system - the NASTY WAY and the AWESOME WAY:<br /><br />********<br />NASTY WAY (most people do this):<br />Most everyone leaves the sifter inside the active box so that the litter itself is sitting inside the sifter. The sifter, in turn, sits inside the active box. From top to bottom we have:<br /><br />SIFTER (contains litter)<br />ACTIVE<br />STANDBY<br /><br />When it's time to change the litter, people simply pull the sifter out and dump the contents into the trash. The sifter then goes into the standby box and the (cleaned) litter is dumped from one box to the other. What was previously the active box is now the standby box and everything gets re-stacked like before.<br /><br />This is the most obvious way and I think the product literature even suggests this. However, there is a small gap between the sifter and active box which leaves room for liquid to gather below (and around) the sifter. Clumping litter will clump *around* the holes in the sifter and create clogs. This also allows for some small clumps to gather on the inside walls of the box - these get smeared over time. After a week or two, you're left with a messy, stinky box and a sifter that needs lots of attention.<br />********<br /><br />********<br />AWESOME WAY (everyone should do this):<br /><br />You can eliminate the clumping inside the sifter if you don't leave the sifter sitting in the litter!!<br /><br />You can order the boxes like this:<br /><br />ACTIVE (contains litter)<br />SIFTER<br />STANDBY<br /><br />When it's time to clean, you simply pull the active box out and pour its contents (including clumped waste) into the sifter (which is sitting inside the standby box). Next, you pull the sifter out like you would have done for the NASTY WAY. The sifter now contains all the waste but, since it hasn't been sitting in the waste, doesn't have any clumps or clogs!! Throw away the waste, put the sifter into the empty box, and stack everything up. Voila! You're done.<br />********<br />I have 2 cats sharing 1 of these boxes. I can completely clean the box in less than 1 minute using this method. This allows me to clean the box every day without trouble. I change out the litter once every few weeks, rub down the insides every few months and do a deep clean maybe twice a year.<br /><br />That's seriously low maintenance and I have the cleanest box of anyone I know!! That includes those with fancy auto-cleaning systems!

review/summary: Awesome litter pan
review/text: I have read many disparaging reviews about this product but decided to give it a try anyway. I'm glad that I did because this really is a great product, my kitty litter pan scooping days are over. I followed the advice of another Amazon user by using the litter pan without the sift sitting in the active litter tray. That way, the holes on the sift won't get gummed up with litter and urine. When you're ready to clean, pour that active tray into the sift and let the "clean" litter fall into the 2nd pan.<br /><br />It's brilliant!! I manage to clean my litter pan in 5 minutes with no mess and certainly no scooping. The only downside to this is that my cat will absolutely not use the litter while the top is on and locked in place. One good note is that the sides of this thing are very high so I have not had problems with my cat kicking litter over the sides of it. Lastly, the carrying handle makes all the difference when taking the unit outside for cleaning. Get this  cat pan, when used properly, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Sifter doesn't work with wet clumps, takes MORE time to use.
review/text: I like the concept this box is going for, but it isn't effective. The sifter does a great job with poop clumps but wet clumps just stay stuck. Even with vigorous shaking sometimes the holes stayed plugged with wet, clumped litter. And if you have a large, wet clump stuck to the side, forget about easy removal! You still need a scoop to make this box work. I stopped using the sifter pretty quick and eventually just tossed it. I do LOVE having two bottom halves. Every three months or so I clean out the box and let it soak in a bleach/water mix for a few hours. Then I pop the clean half on the bottom and swap out when needed. It makes keeps the box clean and sanitary much easier not having to wash it right away and worry about an accident in-between. If you are a 1 box household like me that feature may be helpful but not for the listed price. I bought this box in a store for about $20. It has held up really well and is about 3 years old. The clasps are in great shape and the handle is still sturdy. I can fasten the lid and carry a fully loaded box outside for easy clean up without worrying about anything breaking. I don't use the swing panel door though, my cat never could get used to it. Overall this has been a good litter box and is very sturdy, but don't but it thinking the sifter will be of any help. If anything it took me MORE time to clean the box out than scooping by hand. I do love having the 2nd bottom half and it has held up amazingly, hence the 3 stars.

Lift, and pour the clumps into my Litter Locker. Easier than scooping, in my opinion.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my wheat litter sticks to the side of the box I just emptied, forcing me to get that cement loose. However, I recently read that spraying non-stick cooking spray inside the box before adding litter helps prevent clumps from sticking to the side of the box.<br /><br />My only concern is that it's only available in the one size. At least that I've found. And it's a bit small for my 17 pound (mostly muscle, but is a bit over-weight) cat. I would purchase a larger size if it became available, or easier to find on Amazon.

review/summary: Better than the automatic
review/text: I've used both the Scoop Free and Littermaid self-cleaning. They were ok, but messy to clean, and eventually broke down. One cat didn't like the Scoop Free crystals and used a wall. But the Sifting is great. I recommend taking the whole thing outside to dump the litter from one pan to the other. It's pretty dusty. I also recommend using quite a bit of litter, so that the urine doesn't get down into the grate.

review/summary: Best litter box ever, bought two
review/text: It took us one year of searching until we found our favorite litter box.  The sifter and the two bottom boxes makes this box the easiest to sift and dispose of dirty litter and place directly in to clean waiting second box.  This task takes only five minutes even when cleaning at that time the first sifter and the first bottom dirty box, do it and have the entire box react to go next time.

review/summary: Best Litter Box I've Found
review/text: This the second of these I've purchased.  I found the first one so convinent I had to buy another.  As long as you keep generous amounts of litter in the pan the sifting process works great and there is no need to scope.  The only time I have trouble is when I left the litter level too thin and it clogs the sifting pan.  The sifting pan did begin to crack after several years of use causing me to purchase replace the previous one.

review/summary: Worthless!
review/text: I purchased this item thinking how nice it would be to lift, sift and deposit waste into trash can. What a joke! My husband went to lift and sift and immediately stated "this thing is worthless". I looked at what he had in his hands and agreed. The "sifter" had clumps stuck to it, the debris left in the sifted litter still needed scooped and attempts to get the clumps stuck on the sifter to "loosen" only made more mess. We took sifter out and said "we'll scoop any day". I purchased another van ness sifting pan, without a lid, needless to say I'm not going to use that one either. What a waste of money. This is one of those times when I wished I'd purchased in a local store. I could return and get my money back. I'm not willing to pay return shipping to send back to Amazon.com. Buy the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box as we both like this one very much. Two suggestions with the Omega Paw is to wipe down the inside lid every couple of days and do not over fill with litter.

review/summary: S..t sticks in the mesh!!!
review/text: Agree 100 % with Allie - this sounds better then it is practical. The concept DOES NOR WORK IN REAL LIFE. I did try few different litters - all the same problem - there are peaces always stuck in the mesh of the "cleaning" part pan and to get them out is a messy challenge.I have 2 other boxes and prefer use the old system - scooper daily.<br />"I loved the concept of this but it is messy. I got litter all over the floor when I was tipping it into the garbage sack, bits stick in the mesh and some fall out unexpectedly, and then you have to pour the remaining (dirty) litter into the other pan to get it on top of the mesh again - which releases dust, smells disgusting and just isn't a clever thing to do.

review/summary: Quick and Painless
review/text: I was really bad about cleaning the litterbox prior to purchasing this product. Really bad!  Say once a month? I hated doing it. Now I clean it probably twice a week. A little shaking, switch around the bins, dump the litter in the top, and you're done. My cats like it and I like it. I didn't give 5 stars because sometimes the grating does get clogged but I believe with different litter this might not happen so much.

review/text: I bought this litter box because I was tired of scooping litter. I like the tray that lifts out all the used litter but the one thing I don't like is the door, first, I had problems keeping the door on, when I got it to stay on my cat had no problems getting used to the door(her old one didn't have a door) however, the next time she tried to get in the box, the door stuck. I ended up taking the door off until i figure out a way to attach it permatly, I want the door on to help contol the smell.  l'm still happy with the box, I just wish the door worked.

review/text: We have used this pan for a while.  We found that the door discourages the cats from entry so we removed the door with no problems.  The pan is great, but the postage is a killer.  I have priced these in the store and was happy to "pay less" on-line.  After the shipping and handling, I actually paid more than retail prices.  Tax was about the same.

review/summary: Does the job well, but needs regular maintenance
review/text: We use this box with two cats...one a large tabby (18lbs). What the others note about the clumping litter getting stuck in the sifter is true... urine clumps can get stuck. However, with a little bit of banging against the edge of the garbage can, most of the clumps come loose. The key to using this pan is regular maintenance. Be sure you do your sifting at least once a day, and before reassembling the unit, make sure to rinse and sanitize the spare pan. I've found that I need to hose down and sanitize the black sifter pan and the lid one a week. This keeps the odors down and the pans in good shape. Now, I say all this as somebody who HATES litter pans and for years would not touch them (made my husband do it). With this new set, I've found it takes a few minutes each day and about 10 minutes on the weekend to maintain. No problem at all.<br /><br />I do find that the latches on the lid aren't that great... before lifting the unit, be sure the latches are secure. As cats use the pan, they do come loose. Also, the sifter allows some of the smaller clumps to get through. When you sift, you might consider using a scoop or smaller strainer to lift out those smaller clumps out of the "clean" litter. If you leave them, the odor will get fairly strong.<br /><br />I also suggest that when you reassemble the unit, sprinkle some baking soda in the bottom of the spare pan, and on the bottom of the sifter itself before re-filling the sifted litter. This will help with clumping issues as well as odor.<br /><br />We've tried many different cat pans, and this one seems to be the best so far. Yes, it involves some work... but if you do it regularly, the effort is minimal, and most of it can be done during a commercial break of a TV show.

review/summary: Great to have on hand: they keep for ever and are very tasty!
review/text: I grew up up in a family that loved mushrooms, so I love using them in my cooking. Dried mushrooms are convenient because they keep so well! I like the flavor of Oyster mushrooms and JR Mushrooms brand has an excellent quality.<br /><br />To reconstitute them I put them in water and then put them into the microwave for 4 minutes to get the water boiling. Then let them cool. If some of them are still hard to cut I repeat the process on the ones that are still not soft. Then I cook with them like I would with fresh mushrooms.<br /><br />They are easy to use in many different ways. They taste great sauteed in butter. I like adding them to stews or as ingredient for any sauce I make for cooking chicken. I also found they go great with any Indian sauce, like Pataks: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMAVPS">Pataks Vindaloo Curry Paste 10 Oz</a><br /><br />Mushrooms, what do they taste like:<br /><br />* OYSTER - mild, slightly nutty<br />* PORCINI - sweet, nutty flavor reminds me of hazelnut<br />* CHANTERELLES - sweet mushrooms with flavors that make me think of corn<br />* BLACK TRYMPETS - smokey flavor<br />* CREMENI - more flavorful than button mushrooms, but not as strong as shiitake or portobellos<br />* ENOKI - very delicate flavor, slightly crunchy if fried<br />* PORTOBELLOS - meaty flavor<br />* SHIITAKES - rich, almost beefy flavor<br /><br />JR Mushrooms offer great quality at reasonable price. I recommend them!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: A saving grace for Green Mountain Coffee...
review/text: When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors. Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!

What is up with that?

review/text: It is very strange. Price is high while quality is low, delicious, but different from China's own products. Acceptable.

review/summary: Outstanding!!!!!!!!
review/text: This stuff is fantastic.  I hate, hate, HATE garlic but love tomato sauce.  This stuff has no garlic but is full of herbs and other wonderful flavors.  I found it at my local health food store and bought their stock.....then they ran out.  I use it for everything.  No sauce I've made has ever come close to this stuff.  YUM.

review/text: I really enjoy this sauce. It is not too thick or too light. Just the right blend of tomatoes and spices. You do not need to add anything to improve the taste. Great on pasta as a side dish or as the main course. I think you should try it, you will be glad you did.

review/summary: best ready-made sauce available
review/text: We love this sauce for its simpleness and great San Marzano tomato flavor.  There were some batches that we received that seem better than others, but I guess that can happen.  We generally like to make our own sauce, but when we're in a hurry, this is a great alternative.  Definitely recommended!

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: The price for this is horrible, but this is the most amazing candy ever! I actually bought it to surprise a friend. (She told me it was her favorite and is no longer available.) I tried them and WOW! It was a major hit at our youth Christmas party too.<br />(I am adding to my above 2010 review about a year later. Tootsie has decided to bring these back this year, and you can now found them in many stores for around $2 or less. I suggest you all buy some...just not here!)

review/text: the cost is a bit too much. I'm a teacher who likes to treat her students, but the price is prohibitive. However....I definitely would pay that price (grudgingly) to treat myself. Delish!

review/text: These lollipops are very very good!!!! I loved them when someone gave me one to try at Christmas time and had to hunt down a bag online to still get them after the first of the year. Thank goodness I found them because they are an awesome treat while I am dieting, refreshing mint followed by a little piece of chocolate goodness!!!

review/summary: Nice and crunchy without the cardboard taste
review/text: This toast is great with hummus and all kinds of dips. Very crispy and low fat. Great crunched up in Salads. Great for h'deovers (can't spell)!<br /><br />What I love about this is that sometimes you buy these things and they taste like cardboard. Wasa (swedish brand) is a good example of this. The only complaint, is that this is not 100% whole wheat. First ingredient is Organic Wheat Flour and then followed by Organic Whole Wheat Flour (I buy the Organic version of the Devonsheer Wheat Toast in my local supermarket). If you're looking for fiber, it's minimal, but it's still great!

review/summary: Crunchy
review/text: I used to buy the onion melba toast and they discontinued it and I now buy these which are less flavorful but still very good.<br /><br />I wish they made a line of extra toasted as I like when they are crunchy brown vs. light.<br />You never know which you will get in a pack.<br /><br />Sometimes, a melba toast is made too thin and they crack too easy. This is not often, but it happens.

review/summary: devonshire melba toast
review/text: The melba toast was tasty and fresh. One complaint is that about 20% of the individual cellophane packages had cracked slices!! I realize that store-bought melbas have a worse then 20% breakage.
