review/summary: Food is delicious but way overpriced compared to local supermarket
review/text: It is as yummy and nutritious as all the other reviews claim. You don't have to like Indian food to like this product and it does remind me of a good chile.<br />Regular price at Stop & Shop is $3.69. I thought that was expensive so I decided to look for it online. The price on Amazon and other online retailers is so ridiculously expensive that I'm going back to the supermarket to stock up just in case they priced it wrong.

review/summary: great product, but pricey
review/text: My family generally likes Indian food so it isn't surprisingly that we like this. However, my 7 year old announced today when he got off the bus that he could eat lentils and rice until he had a stomach ache and then he would still eat it! I had sent warmed left-overs with him to school. The product isn't cheap, but it is a great stand-in when you are out of ideas or need a quick dinner. Two pouches of the lentils and one of chick peas do my young family of 5 easily with 1.5 servings left-over. If you were feeding teenagers, I'm sure you'd need a heck of a lot more. With rice, and a salad or fruit or veggie, it makes a fabulous, quick meal in 20 minutes, (just for the rice, or course). I keep several tasty-bite products on hand for such times.

review/text: I bought this at Costco yesterday after trying a sample. This is something I will keep in my pantry. So good! Only 2 Weight Watchers points per serving. I don't like Indian food so I would have never tried this without sampling first. It just taste like a really good chili. My husband couldn't believe that there isn't any meat in it. I have friends on the Weight Watchers plan that also have to eat "gluten free" and I can't wait to tell them about this.

review/text: I'm a big fan of Tasty Bite and I've tried a lot of their offerings.  My absolute favorite is the Madras Lentils. (With or without rice) Than the Channa Masala and Punjab Eggplant. Beans Masala & Basmati Rice Ready Meal s also very good. The ones that I didn't like sooo much were the Jaipur Vegetables, Vegetable Korma, and Kashmir Spinach.  I really wanted to like the Bombay Potatoes but even over a generous helping of rice it's just too spicy, It has a good flavor but there's just too much heat in the mix. As a little side note, it looks like Tasty Bite is in the process of changing their packaging from envelopes in boxes to just envelopes. Good for the environment but WOW! the edges will cut you up. I'm still nursing a good size cut  from simply turning the package over to read ingredients. Hopefully they work on the design a bit more.

review/text: I am a great cook so I generally make things from scratch.  This is something I never would have tried had it not been for [...] giving out samples.  I couldn't believe that it not only tasted good, it also has a simple ingredient list with no additives.  Only wholesome things like tomatoes, lentils, red beans, onions, cream, salt, butter, sunflower oil, chilies and cumin.  That's it--really.<br /><br />I bought it with a quick lunch in mind--brown rice with the Madras Lentils on top, but I have also used it as a base for a dinner meal adding ground turkey sauteed with fresh tomatoes, green peppers, onions and garlic.<br /><br />It is delicious either way.

review/summary: Absolutely Delicious - my favorite Tasty Bite
review/text: I love tasty bite as a product.  I'm mostly vegetarian (I try to avoid as much meat as I can), and I love savory and spicy foods. I've tried at least 15 Tasty Bite varieties (mostly Indian varieties, a couple of the Thai ones), and Madras Lentils is my favorite by a long ways.<br /><br />- It is very flavorful - rich, savory<br />- It is a satisfying comfort food<br />- Good source of protein and not too high in fat or sodium<br />- It is very versitile.  I usually eat it plain (almost like a soup/chili) but you could also serve it with rice or naan or even Tortilla chips.<br /><br />I once held a party where the attendance list surprisingly filled up as people brought more friends that I was expecting.  I took two boxes of Madras Lentils, microwaved them in a ceramic bowl, garnished with a little cilantro, and surrounded with tortilla chips.  My guests didn't quite know what it was ("some sort of lentil/chili dip") but it went FAST and received a lot of compliments (and helped me quickly extend my food offerings).<br /><br />You'll like this one!

Ten minutes later we have a healthy and yummy meal that even my kids (age 4 and 2) LOVE!  And if you buy this through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, the cost for each pouch is only $2!  I usually use 2 bags for dinner and 1 container of tofu.  So I just fed my family of 4 for only $7 :)!<br /><br />P.S.  My son says that this tastes just like the chili from Wienerschnitzel :).

This is a K-cup, just without the outer plastic shell, which makes it a much greener option. If you cut a regular plastic K-cup open, you will see this..... coffee in a pod filter. Why have your coffee surrounded by plastic when it is absolutely unnecessary? This is a GREAT cup of coffee. If you like Starbucks, you will love this. May even be better.

review/text: It's a decent coffee. The Fog Chaser from S.F. Bay Coffee is a better choice.  This is what people consider a "bold" blend.  That means it has harshness that hits you over the tongue like a hammer.  It's not smooth by any sense.

review/summary: Simply The Best "K Cup" Cup Around
review/text: I'm a serious coffee drinker. I like it strong, rich and interesting. My wife prefers a good but milder variety. We've tried many, many K-Cup varieties and found several one or the other of us enjoys, but until now none that pleases us both. SFB's Rainforest does and in spades.<br /><br />This, to me, is simply the best "K-Cup" coffee around.  The details of the packaging are described elsewhere, but (to me)the biggest difference is that these 'not quite K-Cups' have more body than the regular fully sealed type - and lack of "body" is (again, to me) the biggest single failing of even the best K-Cup coffees.<br /><br />Great coffee. Ready in minutes. At a fair price. Doesn't that beat all? :)

As most others have pointed out this is not a true K-cup as the base in not plastic. These make a nice strength of coffee for your medium cup size. It is a little weak coffee for me on the larger size. They come in three bags and I do wish that they could be resealed but I solved the problem by placing them in an air tight container. When I opened the bag of coffee I was hit by the smell of fresh ground coffee. I hadn't realized how much I have missed that smell. You don't get that with the plastic cups. Over all I thought it was a good price and makes a nice cup of coffee. I will be keeping my subscription.

I would drink even more decaf (i drink plenty now...) if there were more options!<br /><br />Yes, as others have said, this is NOT A K-CUP! This is a mini-filter, so you have to keep it sealed or refrigerated until you use it.  It contains more coffee, for a bolder, more delicious cup than the k-cups usually offer.  I can hardly go back to k-cups anymore.

review/summary: Good kcup alternative
review/text: Strong yet smooth. I tend to lean toward dark roasts, but this has a strong smooth taste with none of the bitterness associated with say a French roast. Good coffee, like the filtered kcup San Francisco Bay coffees uses.

review/summary: My new favorite!
review/text: I've been a longtime Starbucks fan, but this is my new favorite! Because of the new, environmentally friendly kcup design, you get the heavenly coffee aroma from the second you open the vacuum sealed bag, a bold cup of coffee that wakes up your tastebuds and lingers on your tongue; it holds up to creamer too and the price can't be beat, as far as I can tell. If you are looking for a robust cup of coffee you won't be sorry.

review/summary: At last!  Good coffee for the Keurig!
review/text: I love coffee.  Good coffee.  For many years, I have bought high-end beans, stored them carefully and ground them right before making a pot of coffee.  My husband and I have a fine dining restaurant, and the coffee we serve there is simply wonderful, because I carefully sourced the coffee we buy to get the best possible flavor.<br /><br />So, when I was given a Keurig as a gift, I was not exactly thrilled.  I am the only coffee drinker in our house, and I thought it would be wonderfully convenient, although I was concerned about the quality of the coffee available for it.  I had no idea it would be as bad as it was.  I know you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you meet a prince, but I sure didn't think I would buy and taste so much pitifully poor coffee in my search for something good.  I tried so many of those environmentally-unfriendly little plastic cups, and even the five-star ones were ... meh.  I even bought several contraptions that let you use your own coffee, but they were more trouble to use than making a whole pot of the stuff, defeating -- for me, at least -- the whole purpose of having a Keurig.  I seriously considered just giving the thing away.<br /><br />Then I saw these lower-priced, more environmentally-friendly pods from San Francisco Bay.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  When my pods arrived, I opened the bag and was greeted by the wonderful aroma of GOOD COFFEE!  My hopes soared.  When I tasted my first cup, I was so happy that I went through my office giving pods to my coffee-loving friends (we use Keurig at my day job).  It's still nowhere near the coffee in our restaurant, but I can at last have GOOD COFFEE at work!  The fact that these are more environmentally friendly and cheaper than the bad K-cups I've bought in the past is just a bonus!<br /><br />I bought several varieties and am happy with all of them, though the Rainforest Blend is my favorite so far, rich but not bitter and with wonderful coffee flavor and aroma.  It's a bit of a pain to keep them in a ziplock bag, but you get used to it, and the coffee is certainly worth it.<br /><br />FWIW, I also tried another environmentally-friendlier pod, Cameron's, and found it not nearly as good as the San Francisco Bay coffee.  I'll stick with SFB from now on, and I'm keeping the Keurig.

review/summary: Neat new more enviromentally friendly K-Cup Option
review/text: I was initially shocked when I initially opened my parcel and found these very cool new San Francisco Bay Coffee Organic One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Rainforest Blend, 80-Count. First this is a great value at $33.00 including free shipping with my Prime Account. For those of you who have not tried Prime membership it pays for itself in between 60-90 days with moderate use and I believe Amazon still offers a 30 day free trial which is worth looking at to experience the benefits. I've had my membership for 3 years and its a great value! Enough for the the Amazon commercial back to the coffee. Price per cup is the lowest I have found anywhere at just under 42 cents. The normal K-cups are all plastic while these have a plastic ring with a fiber filter bag. Its not 100% recyclable but its a big step forward as the filter will break down quickly and the coffee grounds will then fall out allowing those to decompose as well. That leaves a small plastic ring (which looks recyclable) and foil top left. To assist to keep your coffee fresh you receive a reusable lightweight recyclable plastic tub with an airtight lid that holds about 8 K-cups for peak freshness. In addition each 8 K-Cups is sealed in a vented recyclable bag inside the box so you open one and put them in the storage tub after. Nice touch.<br /><br />This is a robust organic coffee with a smooth finish, its gives me above average caffeine buzz, please note I am not big coffee drinker, more a 1-2 good cups a day guy and I like to have variety, thus my move to a Keurig system (which I love and have spread this to 6 others in my family as well as many at my office). Thi is a good coffee with nice flavor and I also like the fact its organic, a little more recyclable and a good value. A++++

review/text: We use this coffee in our Keurig.  My husband likes strong coffee and I like weak.  These pods give us both what we want... he brews his cup then I brew the same pod again and it is still coffee, just weaker.  It saves us money... most of the other pods we've tried aren't strong enough to do a re-brew.

A better design would be to ship the product in a resealable bag or container of some sort. The difference in price between this and the plastic pods makes it worthwhile.

review/summary: Anxiously awaiting more like this - awesome new cup design!
review/text: The San Francisco Coffee Company has a fan here.<br /><br />Let's face it, what used to be an economical way to have a perfect cup of coffee has nearly become an all-too-expensive luxury.<br /><br />When I got my first Keurig coffeemaker years ago, (free from Green Mountain - the very first model made) I was impressed that I could get a consistently delicious and hot cup of coffee that compared with coffeehouse coffee for about 25 cents per cup at home. As the prices have risen over the past few years, we have cut back and use it probably half as much as before. Unfortunately, it is not the coffee but the packaging that costs so much more.<br /><br />Now that prices for many K-cups have risen to close to a dollar apiece, I was extremely pleased to see that someone has begun to offer a more economical and eco-friendly cup for the Keurig. I ordered a 36-pack of the Rainforest Blend to try it out at about .40 per cup - a reasonable price, in my opinion. The coffee is delicious (I will review the coffee itself after sampling some more) and the cups work without issue. In fact, I hope to hell Green Mountain licenses these guys' design to cut the costs of their products (maybe then I will start buying theirs again.)<br /><br />An added benefit is that it is MUCH easier to open the cup and efficiently remove the grounds for composting, before trashing the remains. I would guess I could fit the remains of 1,000 of these cups in the same garbage bag space as 100 of the conventional K-cups. Do yourself (and the world) a favor and start composting now.

review/summary: The smell of real coffee that's very good!
review/text: I think I read every single review here before ordering. At the low, subscribe-and-save price with free shipping, it was a no brainer to give this coffee a try. They arrived quickly and were packed in sealed, thick plastic bags. When I opened one of the packs, I was in heaven over the fresh smell of coffee! I have missed that with the conventional plastic k-cups. I don't know why more coffee companies wouldn't want to use the filtrated type k-cup method over the plastic. It's more natural and I don't see an issue with losing the freshness of the coffee if stored in a zip lock bag or container. Some complained of sediment in the bottom of their cup. I have not had this issue. Nor do I have those few tiny grinds floating in my coffee anymore as I sometimes had from brewing from the plastic k-cups.<br /><br />As for the taste of the coffee: I am a coffee snob. I admit it. I wouldn't be caught dead drinking convenience store coffee or Maxwell House type coffee! This is a smooth blend with no bitter aftertaste. It smells heavenly as it brews and is not weak. It tastes like a medium blend with slight hints of a dark roast. Some days I like it that way and other days, I run it through the Keurig twice for a lighter, yet still smooth taste. I end up with a large mug of coffee for (at this current time on subscribe & save pricing) less than twenty-five cents a cup!<br /><br />I can't imagine ever wanting to have my coffee brewed through a plastic k-cup again or paying sixty cents a cup for other k-cups.<br /><br />Enjoy this fabulous coffee and bravo to this coffee company for coming up with this far superior filter-style k-cup!

I'm betting the OneCup design is a little more eco-friendly as well.<br /><br />My suggestion to the manufacturer would be to make the plastic bag resealable so that I don't have to transfer the OneCups to a Ziplock container.  Other than that, a great product, deserving 5 stars!

review/summary: Fantastic K-cup!!
review/text: Bought a box of these from BJs before I found them on amazon. Let me tell you this is one GREAT cup-o-joe. I was a bit skeptical because of the kcup redesign but it brews perfectly in my B70.  I've been brewing kcups almost exclusively for the past few years, and as another reviewer noted I didn't realize how much I missed the smell of a freshly opened bag of coffee. These things smell Fantastic!  They come packaged in multiple vacuum sealed bags of 8 or 12 depending on the size box you order, I put mine in a vacuum sealed canister to store them on the counter once I open a bag due to the open bottom design of the kcup.  I'm really impressed at how full bodied this coffee is, I absolutely love it, kinda reminds me of a toned down version of  Timothy's Midnight Magic.  I think the thicker nature of the filter and open cup design allows for a more efficient extraction because this coffee turns out perfectly every time.  I also subscribed to the "fog chaser" variety which is very good but a slightly less robust cup.  For now I'm hooked on the rainforest!<br /><br />08/11/2012  Still loving the rainforest blend.  This is by far my favorite k cup of all time. This is the closest you'll get to a fresh cup of "coffehouse" coffee from a k-cup.  I just wish they would come out with a decaf blend also.

The coffee is a little stronger, I think since there is a filter bottom instead of just 1 hole so more coffee seeps out. I just run the machine cup-less for hot water and dilute it myself.

review/text: The cups are different. They have a paper filter that doesn't get punched like regular K Cups.In my opinion they make much better coffee than the others. Rainforest blend is my favorite,but the other blends are good too.

review/summary: This is good coffee
review/text: I was a bit skeptical about trying this product.  I wasn't sure if it would work in my Kuerig.  It is like the k-cup without the plastic cup.  It works just fine & is more environmentally friendly.  The coffee is bold the way I like it.  I would compare it to Emerils big easy bold.  K-cup prices have gone through the roof so it is nice to find an alternative.  I would recommend this if you like a bold cup of coffee.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKAA2">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup, Rainforest Blend, 36-Count</a>

review/summary: Strong coffee, cheaper than K-Cups
review/text: Tried because this was much cheaper than an original K-Cup.  Comes in a plastic airtight bag, but once you open it, you have to put it in a ziploc.  This coffee was stronger than I like, but I'll try another flavor.  The pod design is pretty cool.

review/summary: best k cup I've tried
review/text: We've been using the Keurig for a few years, shortly after they became available for home use. We've tried many brands of K Cups and these, to me, are the best!<br /><br />The coffee is shipped in vacuumed  sealed plastic bags and once you open them, the  aroma is quite intense and intoxicating. After enjoying a few heavenly whiffs, be sure to get a BPA free plastic container that locks air tight. This will ensure that these new style cups don't get stale.<br /><br />Of course, the coffee is sooo good that they likley won't be around long enough to get stale!<br /><br />The flavor is rich and full bodied. It's strong, but not in the bitter or acid tasting sense, only in richness. My 18 year old daughter loves it as does my husband who general prefers breakfast blends that are lighter. I am so happy to have found this and thankful for the other reviewers whose reviews encouraged me to try this. We used to have many great options with the Subscribe and Save offer and a variety of coffees, but since Green Mountain has bought up all these coffees and refused to allow Amazon to do Subscribe and Save anymore, it's just ridiculously expensive to buy them if you have multiple coffee drinkers in your house.

review/text: This is a very innovative idea no cup just the exposed pod.  This product fits perfectly in the Krieg, it did arrive in a plane Box with Three individual bags with vents, and after opening I placed the remaining pods in a zipper bag to preserve the freshness.  I do go through them very quickly, I don't really have to worry about them going stale.  For the price of this it is totally acceptable.  Its a Dark smooth roast, I'd call this a Medium roast very good even at the largest setting, not watered down.  I will recommend this to my friends.  Great product & good Price.  A new Favorite of mine I will defiantly reorder.

review/summary: Too strong/Same taste as Organic with the yellow cap
review/text: This brew is just Ok I will not buy again. I love the packaging, less waste and cups brew just like original keurig. The taste however was not to my liking. It was just like the organic blend with the yellow lid except with a little less bitterness and just a little less burned taste. The aroma and basic taste however were the same. I read on here in another review that they may stop making that brew so if you liked it this will be a very good alternative for you. But for me this is not pleasant. I may try another flavor because I do like the packaging. That is the reason for the three stars not the coffee..

review/summary: Will keep this one coming!
review/text: 1.  I adore the flavor. I find it well balanced and smooth but bold with a slightly toasted flavor. Do not let the pictures deceive you, the pods work perfectly in my Keurig B60 machine.<br />2.  It's comparable to the Newmans Own Extra Bold organic with less intense bitterness. If you like your coffee strong and bitter this may not be for you.<br />3.  The packaging is fine. It comes in vacuumed sealed bags. The pods are hard topped with a tea bag type of material bowl bottom that will allow the coffee to steep when the water is injected into the pod. This design leaves the coffee vulnerable to air and dust if not stored properly.  It's an easy fix. I just toss them into a ziplock bag when I open a vacuum sealed pack of pods. Not a big deal.<br />4.  It seems like the pod design is why the coffee comes out so well. It is ultimately more like how a traditional auto drip maker produces coffee without the wait or waste.<br />5.  Considering the quality you cannot beat the cost.

If you love full-bodied coffee then this brand is the one for you.  Excellent!

review/summary: Best K-Cup Coffee...And less plastic to waste.
review/text: No worries about not being full plastic K-Cup. It is basically a plastic ring with the foil top. A "mesh" filter bag replaces what we are used to being a plastic cup in traditional K-Cups. I guess this means less plastic waste. In the future, I plan to try to compost the mesh bag part. Haven't figured that out yet. No matter. It works just fine.<br /><br />This Rainforest blend has quickly become my favorite coffee. I'm no coffee geek, but if pressed, I'd call the flavor full and round. Not bitter. Not too strong, not too weak. I drink my coffee black, and this one does it for me.<br /><br />If there is a negative it is that the enviro-friendly packaging means that, once opened, you have to keep the un-used coffee in a plastic bag. We use one of those K-Cup Caddies, and this coffee sits on the counter in a plastic bag...next to that caddie. Small price to pay, I think.

review/summary: Good coffee, good price, less packaging to throw away!
review/text: I haven't found a downside to this coffee.  Bought it after receiving email from Amazon highlighting the San Francisco brand, which I had never heard of.  (Since Green Mountain instituted multiple price increases in 2011, and discontinued Hazelnut Dark Roast and a couple other favorites of mine, I have been seeking other alternatives.)  This was a much better price so I decided to try it.<br /><br />Didn't even pay attention to the photo that shows it is a bit different from a regular k-cup.  Surprised at the lack of the plastic cup portion, and very pleased.  My first thought was less crap to throw out into the environment.  Because it is not in a sealed plastic cup, and the plastic bag does not reseal, you need to store in an airtight plastic container or Ziploc bag, as others have mentioned doing.  As G. Eppinger said, the price justifies a little less convenience, and I am happy with less waste.<br /><br />I thought the flavor was great.  I buy only the extra bold flavors of whatever k-cups I purchase, and I did not find this to be weak.<br /><br />I would recommend this coffee, plan to buy it again, and will probably end up putting it on subscribe-and-save.  Green Mountain can keep raising their price if they want, I've found something new.

review/text: I bought these "kcups" to save money as the cost on my usual Kcups rose to 51 cents a cup on subscribe and save and I could not find them cheaper anywhere else online or locally. These ecocups produce a nice cup of medium strength coffee (not as strong as a regular Kcup). I use the Fog Chase and French Roast on the 12 ounce setting but the Rainforest is too weak to use  so I have to use the 8 ounce setting. The Big plus with these ecocups is that they are really good for use with your own coffee! I use DisposaCup Lids to refill these ecocups over and over again! That's a great vaule at 38 cents a "Kcup"!! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NM9YW6">DisposaCup Lids - 100 Disposable Replacement Lids for Use with Any Keurig K-cup - BOX of 100 LIDS</a>

review/summary: Not a K-cup but works in a Keurig
review/text: As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon. Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!

I was told that it is full bodied yet very smooth.  There is a slight astringency that adds a kick to the coffee.<br /><br />They aren't actually in cups but rather little bags with a hard top.  And it comes in 3 bags of 12 rather then in a box.  I can appreciate this fact especially since the savings is passed on to me the customer.  Now if only they would also make an iced tea.

review/summary: Surprise!
review/text: My first surprise was opening the box and finding a different configuration from K-Cups.  The individual package has a plastic ring at the top for sturdiness, covered with foil (as is any K-cup; but from there it is completly different.  There is no plastic cup, only a very fine filter material holding the coffee in a space that is half of what a k-cup would use.  I have seen some reviews that assume this means there is only half of the coffee of a k-cup; but it brews a rich full cup.<br /><br />The first thing that I did was try to find my refillable k-cup to hold it.  Doesn't fit.  Next, I tried placing it into the metal filter for the refillable k-cup.  Doesn't fit.  So I threw caution to the wind, placed the little packet into the b-75 as if it were a real k-cup.......guess what.....it is.  It worked great, will probably keep the lower piercing needle from plugging and made a very nice cup of coffee witout all of the high tech k-cup innards.  Since the is a green mountain compny. i guess they are trying new configuraions.  This one works; but it will require smaller stocking orders much more often to maintain freshness.........a major plus for the original k-cup.<br /><br />I am a strong advocate of sustainable agriculture and fair trade for the farmers.......+++ with this line

review/text: I dont't normally leave a review,but due to the costs of the kcups, i recently purchased an ekobrew reusable filter for my Keurig. Upon finding this item<br />( 36 for 20.00) I thought okay , I will try it. The rainforest brew is a true medium brew, just a bit on the light side, and finishes wonderfully and smooth. The aroma from brewing one cup lingered in my kitchen for hours! Yes, you cannot "display" them in a Keurig holder due to the packaging, but I store mine in a tin next to keurig, clean and tightly sealed. No drip, no problem with brewing in my machine. Love this item, will be back for more.

review/text: I am not one for coffee that is over roasted or extremely strong.  But after reading other reviews and seeing the prices, I signed on up to try both the Breakfast and Rainforest blends.  Some said they were similar to other Kcups they had used, like Donut People, and I have to disagree.  Even upon receipt I could smell the over roasted aroma, but gave it a try.  Luckily we'll have enough company to kill 160 of these things...and I will suffer through a few 12 oz brews (to get it as weak as possible) myself.<br /><br />If you like Green Mountain Kcups, stick with them...this is not what you are looking for.

review/summary: San Francisco Bay- Rainforest Blend for Kurig
review/text: I ordered this new style package to try in my Kurig.  I read the reviews for this before I ordered.  FOR ME I didn't like this blend.  If you like it, that's great, I just will not be buying this blend again.  I took a risk, that I understand, just like any other coffee blend I have not tried before... Three stars for my personal taste only.  Good luck in the market place San Francisco Bay, the K-Cup needs competition.

review/summary: Not bad taste but bad aroma
review/text: The price was right and the coffee was not bad tasting (not great either) but the smell (not really an aroma) when you open the package is a turn off. The semi-K-cup design fits the coffee maker ok but not so well in the carousel.

review/summary: No, they're not traditional K-Cups, but they work fine
review/text: The biggest differences I've noticed between these cups and the traditional plastic K-Cup are (a) they seem to leave a little more sediment in the bottom of the cup, and (b) they produce more "crema" - the brownish foam floating on the top of a good cup of coffee - than most other K-Cup products.  So far, only the "Extra Bold" varieties of traditional K-Cups have come anywhere near the amount of crema generated by these babies.<br /><br />But crema doesn't make up for lack of flavor, and I thought this variety was on the weak and watery side.  It's more like Maxwell House or Folgers than a real gourmet blend - color me distinctly unimpressed.  I found the French Roast variety grew on me, and the slightly "off" taste I thought I noticed at first didn't really bother me by the time I got to the end of the last bag.  But these I'm having to almost force myself to drink.  I didn't think I'd be buying the French Roast again when I first tasted it, but I've changed my mind.  This stuff I'm definitely NEVER buying again - in fact, I'm thinking about taking the last two bags into the office and leaving them by the Keurig for my co-workers to sample rather than drinking them myself - I dislike them that much.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I worked briefly for the company that makes these in the late '70s.  Since I had a personal connection to the product, I really wanted to like it.  Couldn't swing that with this stuff - I didn't care much for it at all.

review/summary: Very strong
review/text: I like strong coffee but was able to use the cup 3  times. Reminds me of Starbucks coffee. The cost is good but you really have to have a taste for very strong flavor. Asfar as ordering it again...NO. If you like strong coffee this will be a barginfor the cost because of making several cups of coffee from 1 k cup.
