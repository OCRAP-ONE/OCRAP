review/summary: really disappointed
review/text: though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did

review/text: I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.

review/summary: Tastes like sweaty gym socks
review/text: I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.

review/summary: Great tasting pecans
review/text: We have used these for years in salads. They are just the right size, easy to chew, and have a nice pecan flavor. If you refrigerate them after opening (as directed on the bag), they will taste fresh for weeks.<br /><br />Kirkland is the Costco brand. I currently buy these at my local Costco for fifteen dollars, which is less than half the current price on Amazon.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are high quality nuts, but shop for price.

review/text: The bag says "Pecan Halves" but very few halves are intact - most are broken (so if you want to decorate the top of a pecan pie - good luck!).  It should be called "Pecan Pieces."  There is a fairly high percentage of shriveled nuts (that are chewey) and too-dark nuts (that are bitter).  Speaking of bitter, I've encountered a few little bits of shell.  And, overall, they are not very fresh.

review/summary: Our favorite coffee
review/text: My wife and I bought this coffee just before Christmas, hoping to be able to serve a truly extraordinary coffee after our very first Prime-Rib-For-The-Whole-Family get-together at our house.  After dinner, I prepared a 12 cup pot in our Cuisinart coffee maker (the one with a carafe: wonderful!) and poured cups for those who wanted coffee.  I hadn't bothered to tell them that it was really expensive and that it was special for Christmas.  (Sort of thinking: our coffee's not always this good -- don't make a habit of coming over for coffee on Sundays!)<br /><br />Every single person who tasted it stopped after the first sip to tell me how good the coffee was.  I hadn't tasted it yet.  When I did, I knew why they had to remark.  This Limoncillo coffee is the most complex, most refreshingly delicious coffee I have ever put to my lips.<br /><br />The next day I went online and ordered five pounds.<br /><br />It's worth every penny I pay for it. You'll not be disappointed, believe me.

review/text: I usally buy the smmall bags of jelly babies at a local Scottish import store here in the town where I live, but every once in a blue moon, they would have the cartons. Each carton is about equivalent to maybe three or possibly even four bags of jelly babies but at a slightly better price and the carton is much more convienent-- or at least, I think so.<br /><br />These cartons are definitely worth buying if one is a lover of jelly babiess. It's just too bad that they are so hard to come by. When they become available, buy them and stock up because these cartons will go quickly.  :-)<br /><br />'Ron

review/summary: Good Candies
review/text: I have to admit that my interest in this product stemmed from watching Doctor Who in the 80's. The Doctor always had some jelly babies in his pocket. The box arrived in good shape and the candies were fresh in the package. The flavor was good and the jelly babies were soft when the package was first opened. I did notice the candies got chewier a few days after the package was opened, even with closing it up between uses. My recommendation is to buy smaller packages if you don't think you will eat all the jelly babies within the first couple days after opening.

review/text: I fell in love with yellow chicken curry after a vacation to Hawaii. I though that by buying an Indian brand curry paste, I could make the dish easier and faster. I do not like hot, spicy food, but I like curry flavor. This paste is too hot for me. If I use one table spoon for the whole pot (feeds 8 people) it's too much. If I got back any, I don't get the curry flovor and the dish is not yellow. This would be great for someone who wants to make a fast yellow curry dish, and who likes it HOT!

The flavor is great & you don't have to use the whole pack - just roll down the top and save some for later.<br /><br />These gravy packets also make an excellent binder, to replace the UBI (you know - Campbell's cream of mushroom) in dishes like broccoli rice casserole (throw in a little Daiya cheese!).

review/text: I can't say that I experienced a mouthful of Shitake flavor on my first taste but I was pleased nonetheless.  It was easy to mix and thickened quickly.  I was in the market for a lower calorie, lower fat, lower salt (?) alternative to canned and packaged gravies that I could use for weeknight menus.  I love those old fashioned hearty casseroles that my mother used to make but have become "unhealthy" in my older years.<br /><br />I've used this mix, as is, for mashed potatoes, but prefer to use it as a base for vegetable pot pie, chicken/tofu/tempeh a la kings, cream soups and stews.  It worked pretty well for all of those without a strong "packaged" flavor that some mixes have.<br /><br />The quality of this mix encouraged me to try a few other Road's End products - I think that, in itself, is a pretty good recommendation!

review/summary: GREAT ICED TEA
review/text: One of the best, if not THE best iced tea I ever had, was served at a little cafe beside a golf course in Arizona.  I asked the cook/waitress what type of tea they used, and she told me Farmer Brothers brand out of Flagstaff.  So I ordered a box of the Farmer Brothers Black Tea bags.  Each tea bag they say makes a gallon of iced tea.  She had a special machine to brew hers in, but I just use a large saucepan, pour hot water in it, and put the lid on it and let it steep for five minutes or so. When making mine, I use only three quarts of boiling water.  I guess the difference in the amount of water it takes is the machine, which I priced, and they started at $500.00.  However, you can still make the same great tea using just a little less water.

review/text: I am a major fan of the Cornucopia kits and this kit was the third kit of theirs I bought.  The wine was great, but as one reviewer pointed out, the labels are misspelled.  That's just a minor issue and was good for a few laughs.

review/summary: Very enjoyable wine with great taste
review/text: We prefer a sweeter dessert type wine and all the Cornucopia kits we have done (and we have made several) have proven to be to our liking. Sweet wines with very good flavors. We also enjoy the lower alcohol content these kits tend to have and that they don't over power the flavor. If you like a bit more alcohol, it's easy to boost that with a little corn sugar when you start.<br /><br />Having done a number of kits now, it's hard to beat the price on the Cornucopia kits. Other kits don't include corks, labels and foil wraps and are more expensive. Another bonus for us has been time. The Cornucopia kits are done and ready to bottle well within the 4 week time while "other brand" kits have run longer than the 4 weeks to bottling.

review/summary: A delightful, refreshing drink
review/text: First of all, there are two or three negative reviews for this tea flavor. Let's face it, we all have different tastes and what's a delight to me may be disgusting to you.<br /><br />But this is one of my favorite drinks. It's clean tasting, refreshing and just a hint of mint to make it that way. It's a light tea that is thirst quenching, unlike many drinks.<br /><br />If you enjoy a clean, light tea and if you like mint, you'll probably delight in this tea.<br /><br />The price here on Amazon is a bit high. I bought the tea at my local grocers for $1.50 a bottle. That may have been a sale price, however. And this brand isn't at every store. So ordering online may be the best option.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />- Susanna K. Hutcheson

review/summary: This is a great tea
review/text: I really like Ito En, products it tastes like tea (what a concept) and this one tastes like green tea with mint leaves. (Most tea drinks taste like sugar water these days)If you are expecting a "peppermint patty" you may not think that this tastes like mint but indeed it does. Very refreshing sometimes I add a few drops of Blue agave sweetener.I just wish the price was not so high. Also the taste of their products has changed slightly since the product is now made in Thailand as opposed to Japan.

review/text: I have been getting into the Ito En green teas and have primarily been drinking the traditional green, jasmine and dark green.  I wanted to try some new flavors and bought a bottle of this at my local Whole Foods to try first.  Man, this is really good!  The mint is very subtle but refreshing!  It lends itself to a sweet finish that I really enjoy...I am motivated to buy a case because it livens up the regular green tea I have been drinking so much of.  I wish I had tried it sooner!

review/summary: Great food for my dog
review/text: My Australian Cattle Dog loves this food, and it is much healthier than grocery-store dog food.  I have recently learned that dogs cannot digest grains, especially corn, and dog food that contains these ingredients just makes their stomachs upset, and their poop bigger and stinkier!

review/summary: Great dog food in theory, but....
review/text: I've been struggling to find the right dog food for my Giant Schnauzer Stella who suffers from digestive issues.  I was told that grain-free food was the way to go since the grain was probably causing her allergic reactions.  I bought Artemis and after going through three large bags of this formula, her digestive issues have only gotten worse. She has very loose stools and passes the most awful gas.  Even her body odor has gotten worse, and she requires baths every other week.  Her energy level also decreased significantly.  I was at my witt's end after going through various types of premium dog food including Artemis most recently.  Bottom line is, I dropped they dry kibble and I've been feeding her homemade chicken, rice and veggies with a multivitamin powder mixed in for extra nutrition, and her symptoms have all disappeared.  I don't care what anyone says, dogs do need carbohydrates (grains)!  Stella has regained her energy, her coat is shiny, her eyes are bright and her issues with the loose stools and gas have disappeared completely.  I know, this seems like a tremendous chore, but it's easier and cheaper than you think.  It's a lot better than having to clean after her loose stools...lol..I make her meals in bulk and I freeze the food into separate portions for the week. For variety I feed her chicken liver or the beef special of the week.  No matter how "premium" a dog food is, it will never compare to real, whole proteins, veggies and starches. There are tons of easy dog food recipes on the internet. If you are struggling with the same issues and you only want the best for your baby, please at least try it for a few weeks. He/she will love you for it!!!

review/summary: I Love LA Hot Sauce!
review/text: I love hot sauce, specifically the Louisiana cayenne type. The smaller bottles I can go through in a week, without really trying. Most things I eat are not ready for enjoying until the sauce is ka-chunked on, two or three glops or more. So, needless to say, I really appreciate the larger refill containers of hot sauce. I had recently been using the Red Devil brand, since they had the larger re-fill bottles, an item that was no longer easily obtainable for me. At such times of need, I tend to look on amazon.com for replacements. When I found the Franks Red Hot (a brand I have used before) in a 1 gallon size, I thought I'd died and went to hot sauce heaven, or else Nawlins. This should easily last me three or four months!

review/text: Better than Tabasco for sure but nothing special. Fairly mild for those who don't like heat (I'd give it a 3 out of 10) and decent flavor just nothing great. This is a good basic hot sauce that you'll find in a lot of colleges or diners but definitely not the best. If you want a great hot sauce I recommend Tapatio, it has a better flavor with about the same level of heat.

I do not know of a hot sauce that tastes better, everything is blended very well. Not too hot, just a touch of vineger and a nice cayenne pepper taste.<br /><br />Best of all, add Frank's and some butter on the stove, let it sizzle for 2 minutes and you have great tasting wing sauce!<br /><br />The only bad thing I can report on this sauce is if you find a very old bottle still on the shelves. There could be a small chance of some clumping and flavor issues.

But, about the chocolate, the flavor and texture are great! I like that old-world, kind of gritty texture, so different from the smooth, overly sugary, mass-produced "chocolates" people buy every day. You must try Blanxart!

review/summary: Healthy Alternative to Kibble, Canned or Raw Diets
review/text: Actually, Sojo's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw, but it an be cooked as I choose to do.  My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy.  Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing.

I got a refund from Amazon with no question and very quickly, but Amazon needs to keep control of the "use-by" dates of food they offer on their site.

review/summary: picky puppy...
review/text: I have a now 8 month old male Shih Tzu.  When I brought him home from the breeder, I kept him on the 'Pro Plan Puppy' tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished.  There was about 2 cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as I put it down.  As a test, I rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happen...he'd eat about 10 pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with. (Which I was happy with, as I don't want to 'play' with his food as a game to get him to eat).  I went and got him Blue Buffalo dry puppy food (lamb and oatmeal formula), which had bigger size kibbles.  It seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits, since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones, venison antler, lamb lung chips for comfort.  Again when I got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag, he would walk away from the bowl---this went on for almost 3 days.  He was still having small bowel movements, urinating, drinking water and playing, running and continuing his successful training exercises; called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by Science Diet/Veterinarian's Diet after the exam, which showed nothing physically wrong.  The one vet tech said that Shih Tzu's tend to be picky eaters.  I didn't pick up the food at their check out counter, left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet.  I know from some of our outdoor excursions that he's attracted to road kill (he'll sniff the air, and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devices...but I won't allow it).  I remember being a kid in the late 60's early 70's and all my friends who had dogs fed them 1 of 2 choices available back then: Gravy Train or Alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat; they ate bones, etc and all lived into their late teens.  One of my friends small mutt lived to be 24 years old!!!  I never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem, since I grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance.  Well, I read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the Sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighs/breasts.  My Weston isn't a big fan of totally raw meat, but when browned (I put it in the toaster oven and add 1/4 tsp of 'Missing Link' to the meat portion) with the soaked Sojos Original, he eats with gusto!!!  From his early days, I would play with and take his food away, so he's not food aggressive.  He eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done.  Weston then wants to play hard, train hard, take a nice walk and nap.  His coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed.  The droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up.  I just had him neutered 2 days ago and he ate this Sojos mix with the same gusto (even with the e-collar to challenge him).  So I am a fan and we are finished with the second 2.5 lb bag and I just ordered another one.  Hope this helps someone with a picky eater; I know another reviewer mentioned their Shih Tzu not liking it, but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other, much like us humans.

review/summary: Very odd flavor.
review/text: A look at the seasoning ingredients and I thought I would love this mix-organic jalapeno, organic cilantro, organic lime juice, organic spices- it's full of things I love. However, when I received the mix and tasted it I was overwhelmed. I thought maybe it was just too concentrated so I also purchased a bag of the go raw naked seed mix and mixed them half and half. There's just something off about the flavor, it doesn't taste right. I have only eaten them by themselves however, so they might be okay if sprinkled on a salad, but definitely not something I could just snack on by themselves. I won't purchase them again.

review/summary: Different - Maybe the taste will grow on me...
review/text: The old saying is" "to each his own."<br /><br />I ordered these as an alternative to salt on fresh baked soft pretzels. The sunflower seeds that are roasted and salted are a great way to cut the salt, and I remember pumpkin when getting pretzels in Frankfurt.<br /><br />This mix has just a touch of spice. I expected them to have more zip.<br /><br />I will try the un-spiced ones for pretzels. I don't think these will work for me in that context.<br /><br />Not thrilled as a stand alone snack. :/  Of course as your tastebuds go: YMMV.

There is no label, no country of origin, no weight/measure data, no nutrition information, no warning that it contains nuts, etc.  Literally, someone scooped the nuts out of a bulk bin somewhere, put them in a bag, tied it off and put the bag in a US Postal envelope and shipped it.  The nuts, of course, were crushed with this shipping method.  No matter, because they are going back.  I do not recommend purchasing these nuts.

review/summary: Scintillating Cinnamon & P.S. Caveat
review/text: When Trident dropped their cinnamon flavor (Robt Redford's favorite and mine), I went into sense-mourning.  After a year of pretending not to care and chewing peppermint flavored gum as a poor second choice, the 5-Flare pricey but good substitute came on the market.  YAY!  Then, gone, nada, nothing, nowhere in the San Francisco Bay Area could I find it.  I tried contacting whoever makes Trident and didn't get a response.  Researched the internet and found that cinnamon trees have a disease from time to time and it becomes rare, and thus difficult to produce.  To top it off, I read the flavor of cinnamon was a favorite of oldsters.  Hm, I'm over 65 and therefore potentially in a dwindling market (all our false teeth and arthritic jaws?).  However, I fell upon the Flare gum in a Pennsylvania store off the beaten track so I knew it continued to exist.  Now I'm on the internet and buying it through Amazon.  Bless you kiddos.<br /><br />P.S.  Two months after the above review....I think I cried "huzzah" too soon.  Almost every box I opened from this shipment from this purveyor (and I bought several multi-packs at one time), from the beginning of their tenure in my cool storage closet, had at least four sticks stuck together (each individually wrapped, yet still stuck to each other).  I checked, and Wrigley's is still making this flavor, so I don't know why they were glued together, making them unusable.<br /><br />I was told that the perfume sold in perfume "stores" in shopping malls are made up of mostly old product (thus the scent won't be "true").  I'm wondering if the same thing is happening with these wholesale online sellers.  They buy old, degenerating product from Wrigley's and pass them onto us? For my next order, I won't go with this particular seller.

review/summary: Excellent Emergency Provisions.
review/text: Here in California, we have an ongoing threat with natural disasters, and I'm thinking specifically of earthquakes. All electricity, natural gas, most communications and transportation could be out of order for unspecified times and It is advised that the populace ought to be prepared for such an event. Foodstuffs, water, batteries, temporary lighting and a variety of other provisions ought to be in supply to last at least a week. Well, no one can ever be totally prepared for a natural disaster, but I try to at least keep the food and drinkable water cabinet full. Fruits and veggies are real easy in canned or dried forms. Nuts, dried foods of other kinds and crackers are a snap. Good sources of protein are another matter and a little more difficult. Here I've gone with a number of canned items and one such item is Kirkland Signature Roast Beef in Beef Broth which comes in four-can packets and which I get at my local Costco warehouse store. It's fairly economical and easy to use. It's rather tasty for a canned meat product and can be eaton as is or cooked into a variety of meals. It's vary low in fat and consists of chunks of top and bottom round. It's fully cooked, but might be heated if you like. Now and then, in non-emergency times, I use a can so that there is a gradual turnover. Plus, I like to take a can or two along  when I go on camping trips. It suits these purposes well and I'm very satisfied with this product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Tender Chunks
review/text: Here's the content for this product:<br />Beef, Beef Broth, Salt, Modified Food Starch, and Sodium Phosphates.<br />12 ounces; recommended serving size: 2 ounces; servings per can: about 4 (that recommendation probably takes the presence of the liquid into account); calories: 80; calories from fat: 15.<br /><br />Total fat: 1.5g, 2%; Saturated fat: 0.5g, 3%; Cholesterol: 40 mg, 13%; Sodium: 180 mg, 8%; Total carbohydrate: 0; Sugars: 0; Protein: 15 g; Iron: 6%.<br /><br />Distributed by Costco Wholesale Corporation; 1-800-774-2678; [...]<br /><br />I pronounce this product good and low in salt.  The only drawback might be the phosphate content, but if that doesn't kill me, something else most definitely will.<br /><br />I'm a skinny person, but whatever food providers claim to be a serving never works for me.  The most I'll get out of this can is two servings; a larger person might have to eat the entire can's content, which contains a lot of broth.  I had my serving with mashed potatoes and peas, and it was good after I doctored the meat with curry, onion, Tobasco sauce, sesame oil, and garlic.  Although olive oil makes a lot of things taste delicious, my body behaves better when I feed it sesame seed oil.  Next time, I'll try the beef in spaghetti sauce or tomato sauce with vegetable puree.  However, I'm okay eating insipid stuff, so I could have easily eaten the meat as a sandwich with just lettuce and tomatoes.  For people who can't eat anything without flavor, you will need to add whatever you prefer; think of it as plain beef because that's pretty much what it is, with plenty of beef broth that you can use as a stock for stew, gravy, or any other concoction.  I used a portion of the broth over my potatoes; it made them smoother.<br /><br />The meat comes in stew-size cubes that were apparently pressure cooked to tenderness, since they flake apart with a fork - I like tender meat.  The meat has almost zero fat; much of which was solid and stuck to the lid, so I guess my apartment is comfortably cold.  The pack comes with three Mexican-style recipes, but you can definitely do your own style of cooking; a beef stroganoff would be nice.<br /><br />When I used to drive along the east coast and stay at the Days Inn, I always carried my own canned goods with me that I warmed up at the motel because a can of Health Valley soup, Del Monte vegetables, Progresso tuna fish, or Crown Prince salmon is always healthier than eating at one of those fast food chains.  I suspect that eating this Kirkland roast beef is also healthier, despite the sodium phosphate.  As the daughter of a cook, I can prepare fine fresh food, but I choose not to because I don't like kitchen duty.  So, whenever I don't order take out, canned or frozen items and baked potato work fine for me.  Conclusion: I recommend this product and will buy it again.

review/text: These are Pajarero figs from Valencia, Spain.  They are delicate, sweet figs that have thin skins. They're naturally dried then hand dipped in Caro Dark Chocolate . I discovered these at a boutique grocery in mid December. They were a little pricey ($10.00 for 4.9oz), but I love figs and chocolate. So, I decided to give them a try.  I'm glad I did!  It's nearly mid January and I'm still enjoying these little babies.  The figs are still soft and delicious.  The amount of dark chocolate to fig ratio is perfect.  I agree with another reviewer who said that just one was enough to end a meal.  So true.  If you like fig and dark chocolate, you won't be disappointed!

review/text: Many years ago a restaurant-owner said his secret to being able to serve such tender low-cost steak was the use of a tenderizer.  A tenderizer that worked like a charm came on the market shortly after that. You sprinkled it on the meat and blended it in with fork tines about thirty minutes before you cooked the meat.  Today's tenderizer (Adolph's) is supposed to work immediately by just sprinkling it on.  Not.  sorry.  Maybe it's the new cuts of meat with much less fat on, but it just doesn't work.

Other reviewers said it worked for them, so I placed the order.  Sadly, all of our dogs are still eating poop.  We don't just have one dog to test it on either, we have five...yes five.  It didn't work for any of them.<br /><br />This being said, I don't want to say it doesn't work for its intended purpose, to tenderize meat.  We just didn't use it for that.<br /><br />If you're buying it to try to keep your dogs from eating their own feces, I'd shy away from it.
