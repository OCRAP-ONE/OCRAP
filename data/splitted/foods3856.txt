review/summary: raw fed travel made easier  *BUT*....
review/text: I have a small breed service dog and his raw food diet can be a challenge when we travel. I bought this food based on the fact that it's the closest ingredient-wise to what I'd feed him at home. He loves this food and literally spins in circles when he hears me open the container I store it in, something he has NOT done for other foods in the past.<br /><br />My issue with this food is that when I received the bag I noticed through the window on the back of the package that the lower third of the bag seemed to be mostly crumbs; in transferring the upper portion of the bag to a smaller storage container I found that most of the bottom of the bag was almost "dust". The "dust" makes my dog cough even if he eats slowly; adding a little water to his bowl has helped with this issue.<br /><br />Edited to add: I've added a photo so you can see what winds up in the bowl.<br /><br />Since this was my first bag of ZiwiPeak I'm not sure if this is normal for the brand - at this cost though I feel it shouldn't be. It could be that the product had settled and the heavy weight of the upper product caused the lower portion to settle and break, or maybe this bag just had a really rough time in shipping. Either way, this product makes traveling so much easier and my pup just loves having it at home as a treat so I've ordered a second bag today and will see if the crumb issue repeats itself or not.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/16/12: The second bag (Lamb) was received in perfect condition this time.<br /><br />Would purchase again and recommend.

review/summary: Worth every penny
review/text: I finally upgraded to the 11 lb bag after purchasing several 2.2 1b bags. I have two small dogs at home, both are 10 pounds each. I was trying out the raw food diet after doing research online, and while the dogs loved it, I was definitely not a fan of the raw meat and having to wipe everywhere when they were done eating.<br /><br />Along comes Ziwipeak, and I tested out the different flavors in the smaller portions, ALL of which the two dogs loved.<br /><br />Here are the marked differences since switching over (previously they were on Merrick dry food, before that was Halo).<br /><br />Fresh breath, no more doggy odor!<br />Stools do not smell (or very very faint)<br />One of the dogs - a Maltese - her tearstains have completely disappeared!!<br />Glossier coats<br />More energetic<br /><br />Etc etc.<br /><br />So even though this is expensive, in terms of the visible differences you can see in the dogs, I believe it's worth it!

review/summary: Finally a dog food my Yorkie will eat
review/text: I have tried all types of raw dog food for my yorkie. He used to like the Paw Naturaw Grassfed Bison meals, but the last two bags i received had to be mixed with fresh raw meat in order for him to eat it. I tried Stella & Chewy's Freeze-Dried Raw meals and ended up having to do the same with that food. This morning i put out a small portion of "ZiwiPeak Real Meat Grain Free Air Dried Raw Dog Food, Venison & Fish" from a 2.2 lb bag and my yorkie gobbled it up. Shipping was quick too. I order on Monday and received it on Tuesday. I am very pleased with the product and the shipment.<br /><br />I am sold on this product and will definitely order this again.

review/summary: What a great product!
review/text: My dog started to become finicky with her Wellness Core dog food.  She must stay on it for allergy purposes so I really have no option but to encourage her to eat it.  I never in a million years thought I would spend 26 dollars on 2 pounds of dog food but I did.  I do not feed this to my dog by itself.  I crumble up the pieces and mix it in with my dog's food.  Man....does she gobble up her food now.....it is terrific not having to sit with her to get her to eat.  Even the cat picks some of the Ziwi out of her bowl.  : )  I certainly could not afford to feed my dog this food by itself but for those of us that want to give our dogs a treat or that need a supplement to encourage our pets to eat, I would strongly recommend this dog food.  It is quality through and through.  : )

review/summary: greatest dog food ever, but the price jump the worst
review/text: I can't say enough about ZiwiPeak, hands down the best dog food on the market, both dry (11 lbs) and canned food. I have been buying them regularly and Whole Health Pet had the best price, special offers, shipping and service. Unfortunately, with the New Zealand manufacturer's new canning supplier and packaging, within two weeks Whole Health Pet started charging freight and their prices jumped up to $2.00 more average PER CAN (plus shipping), and $40 more PER BAG (plus shipping)!! I am not changing ZiwiPeak for my dogs, but I am buying elsewhere which has slightly lower price overall but with faster shipping. I feel I need to talk about the price, because while ZiwiPeak could be the best dog food ever, so many more dogs cannot have them because the price is simply beyond their owners' reach, not good.<br /><br />I hope Amazon Prime will pick up this line soon!!!

review/summary: Our 2 dogs LOVE it!!!
review/text: We have a 6 month old Shih Tzu and a 2 year old white fluffy mix.  They weight 8lbs and 15 lbs respectively.  Each eats about 1 scoop a day.  Each 11lb bag lasts us about 1.5 months.<br /><br />Yes - it is not a lot of weight, but its also not full of filler.  A lot of dogs eat 3x + what they need to because their food is so lacking in nutrients.  This is pure meat (which as a vegetarian is odd to write).  Our dogs love apples, bananas, and oranges - but love their lamb.<br /><br />Warning - we just moved and couldn't find Ziwipeak.  They wouldn't touch anything else we bought!  Seriously.  They are hooked. They love it.<br /><br />So we are huge fans!

review/summary: Best alternative to a raw diet
review/text: This is the best alternative to feeding your dog a natural raw diet.<br />But it is WAY over priced. You can make your own raw diet for less than $1 a pound. Sorry but $10+/lb is not a good bargain. You can buy human grade cuts of raw fresh meat for WAY less than that. Even Lamb.<br />Good philosophy, not practical.

review/summary: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the product AND the company behind it!
review/text: I wrote a REALLY long review regarding a different brand freeze dried dog food and now I'm wishing I hadn't because it probably makes this product seem not as good in comparison and nothing could be further from the truth!<br /><br />When I originally read all of the reviews about this product I was a bit skeptical but VERY hopeful (despite the cost)since so many reviewers said that this was the one food that their totally-picky dog would actually eat.<br /><br />When I first tried giving her a nibble while out on a walk she turned her nose up at it like she does with all new things. I slowly started giving her some, mixed in with a clump of almond butter and her kibble. Eventually I got her to eat it and was happy to have something else to feed her along with the kibble and the other raw products I feed.<br /><br />(I know that raw is not supposed to be mixed with kibble, but in this case I am just trying to get her to eat anything) Anyway, I continued to do this until one day she just didn't seem to want it. Finally it dawned on me that she probably JUST wanted this and nothing else and much to my surprise I was right!<br /><br />She likes it so much that she will eat it without the almond butter, which is a HUGE relief to me for it's literally the FIRST and only food I've been able to skip the almondt butter with since she first stopped eating.<br /><br />She will get sick of it after a few days so of course I alternate what I feed her; before she had stopped eating completely I had her on a rotation diet which I believe is better for them anyway. The only downside, of course, is the cost, especially if you have a bigger dog like I do.<br /><br />It's understandable, however, since the food is imported and air dried which I imagine takes longer. I love being able to feed my dog a raw diet without the GI upset she gets with fresh raw. I finally noticed that her feces is MUCH smaller when she is on a raw-only diet, and for a dog of 60+ lbs hers weren't that big to begin with.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I can't say how AWESOME the ZiwiPeak company is! When I first noticed and wanted to try this product I emailed them asking if I could purchase a sample anywhere. Within days I received a package of the venison product in the mail. (Their "trial size" is a good size bag!) It wasn't until after the fact that I saw that you CAN purchase that size through Amazon, and it retails for $8-$10!<br /><br />Even MORE impressive to me was a few months later when I wanted to try the lamb variety. I wasn't able to find a similar trial size package of the lamb anywhere online, so I emailed them again and asked if the lamb variety was avaialble for purchase in anything smaller than the 2.2 lb bag.<br /><br />Once again within a few days I receive a package in the mail from them, and this time it included a large zip-lock baggie filled with the lamb variety and a scoop. Apparently they don't make the small trial bags of the lamb but that didn't stop them from sending me some! (which so far my dog seems to like!)<br /><br />To put this into perspective, I have emailed other raw manufacturers asking where I can purchase sample products from, including the other company I reviewed, and many of them never even answered me much less sent me anything!<br /><br />It definitely feels good to be feeding my dog something that I know she actually likes, plus feeding the benefits of a natural raw diet, PLUS a product that uses a drying process that hopefully preserves some of the natural enzymes of raw food.<br /><br />Can't say enough good things about this food - if it was the ONLY food I fed my dog it wouldn't be nearly as expensive to feed her but unfortunately because of her pickiness this isn't the case.

I add some cooked veggies and water, and they go gaga over it.<br /><br />Thank you, ZIWI Peak, for making a product without fillers!

review/summary: Ziwipeaks: A great, all natural dog food
review/text: Ziwipeaks is a great, freeze dried diet for my dog. Though it runs a bit expensive and rare, it's a great all natural, product. I use the venison because I'm trying to stick with my mini dachshund's ancestral diet. My mini is 2 years old and has been using this food for about 16 months now. She has a beautiful, soft, shiny coat and is healthy and energetic. The food comes in these small bits which are softer and more manageable for little, 13# dogs. Ziwipeaks is an excellent brand if you want no grain or sugar additives and you want to give your dog one of the best quality foods available.<br /><br />S. Joseph

review/summary: Excellent food for dogs with allergies
review/text: My golden|yellow lab mix was adopted from the shelter with a number of health issues including severe malnutrition, a pretty bad skin condition, and chronic  inflammation of the feet and face.  We placed him on an elimination diet and found that he was allergic to chicken, turkey and beef.  I use the ZiwiPeak, fish and pork as the main sources of protein for his diet. He loves the venison over the other flavors and has put on 40 healthy pounds and his skin and allergy issues have pretty much been cleared-up.<br /><br />The food is not the hard dried fare, but small moist squares.  It offered a good option for a balanced meal and you cannot beat the convenience of the pouch.  I would recommend refrigeration after opening.

review/summary: Great substitute for raw diet, but expensive!
review/text: We have a 13 month old, 100+ pound Rottweiler who loves his Ziwipeak.  We started him on the raw diet a few months ago, and use ZiwiPeak for training treats and for regular meals.  It combines the benefits of a raw diet with the convenience of kibble.  Notable good points: great 'output' for a dog with a sensitive stomach, gleaming coat with significantly less dander, fresh breath, easy to feed, and good for times when feeding frozen raw is difficult (traveling, boarding, you've forgotten to defrost the raw...).<br /><br />I took away one star for the high cost.  HOWEVER, a portion of Ziwipeak goes a longer way than the same amount of kibble, and the cost is on par - or slightly less if you look around - than most frozen raw foods.

The only thing that was better was a completely RAW diet, but with that you never know if the product you have purcahsed is the freshes it can be, and the pet suffers for that. where as the ZIWIPeak stay fresh for at lest 30 days after you open it and longer if you serve from the freezer.

review/summary: Best thing on the market (without the mess)!
review/text: My puppy has been on way too many dog foods: Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and now ZiwiPeak. Out of the four, I'd say this is the best but also the most expensive. A 2.2lb bag lasts probably 3 weeks at most, but at least I know I'm feeding her raw without the mess of raw. It's not cheap but considering how much it costs for us to eat out per meal, $28/bag for 3 weeks really isn't much on the larger scheme of things. It also helps that she loves this stuff and gobbles it up and we know she's not getting any filler. For those who are concerned that the serving size in the back is too little, we had the same concern. But after giving her more than what was recommended, we noticed our puppy was not finishing her bowl of food each time which told us that she was already full and didn't even want more. So if you're used to feeding your dog kibble, the reason there's less to feed her is because there's no filler and it's just meat, meat and more meat so they fill up on it without having to process things like potato. I've also noticed that my dog sneezes and farts significantly less. She used to get eye stains but after we switched to Orijen and now ZiwiPeak, we noticed that her stains disappeared all together!<br /><br />Unless my puppy has any health or allergy issues to ZiwiPeak, I will never switch her to any other brand or type of food!

review/text: This dog food is absolutely wonderful.  If I could afford to, I would feed my dog only this.  My 2 year old Vizsla is the pickiest dog I've ever met (won't even eat most treats) and she can't get enough of this food.  Not only does she actually get excited about her meals, it has had marvelous effects on her digestion, even though she only gets this food about half the time.  Her stools are noticeably smaller and more solid (always a problem with her) and her usually bad flatulence is almost non-existent.  If you have a dog with any food sensitivities and have tried many different foods this will be the last food you will need to try.  My dog has never looked and acted healthier than she has on this food (and I have tried about 20 different brands).  You won't be disappointed, it is worth every penny!

He just would not eat other dry dog foods and we were told feeding him canned food should be the exception and not the rule.<br /><br />This seems to be it. He likes this one the best.  But we are going to have to rotate it with other varieties. Because he just wont eat the same thing for any length of time.<br /><br />Definitely, he likes this one a whole lot.

Why wouldn't he?<br /><br />A hidden advantage of using this food is that you don't have to pick up much poo at all. Because this food is nearly twice as concentrated as kibble you'd only be picking up about half as much poo, which is a good benefit. Also, it takes up half as much space in your storage.<br /><br />An all around winner which more than makes up for the small premium in price.

review/summary: My Westie loves it!
review/text: I have a 6 year old westie that had the worst food allergies, her coat was very brittle, and she had low energy.  One walk and she'd be passed out.  As many of you on here, I take pride in my dog and pride that I want to take care of it the best that I am able to. I've tried blue buffalo and other high rated foods, but she would not eat them unless I "spiced" it up with something. It was time consuming, frustrating, and hard to keep her on an eating schedule.  I finally decided to give this a go ahead even though it is on the pricey side.<br /><br />What I've noticed is that she eats it immediately and even licks her bowl.  Her coat is soft and shiny now, she's a running dog now than a walk dog (and thats saying something considering she's a westie), and her eating schedule is regulated and I have a better idea of what she's eaten so I can control her weight (she's a small westie around 14 lbs.)<br /><br />For those of you thinking that its too expensive there's no way you could afford to keep your dog on this diet. For my dog she requires about 0.75 ounces or 3/4 of a scoop and that goes a long way for a 2.2 lb. bag.  So its not like I am buying this dog food every week.<br /><br />The only small negative is the dog food has a slight smell to it.  Nothing that will make you vomit but its not something I am used to smelling when giving her dog food.  For those wondering what the dog food looks like?  It's like small shredded pieces of dark jerky.<br /><br />Recommendation?  BUY

review/text: My dog loves his ZP. He's primarily a ZP venison kind of guy due to allergies, but with trying to introduce new protein sources to him I've turned to the other varieties of ZP including the Venison and Fish and Lamb. Both were gobbled down without hesitation. Clearly he doesn't know that the food is good for him, or I suspect that he would be requiring it to be doused with canned food! But that is the wonderful thing about ZP - it is super high quality with no grains or fillers AND dogs love it. And my boy Titan looks better than he ever has; he's always been a strong dog, but on ZP he looks like he lifts weights. He's been on an exclusive ZP diet for about 4 or 5 months and his coat is shiny and velvety like a champion racehorse.<br /><br />Something to attest to the supreme flavor of this food: recently I was running low on ZP and so I had to supplement with some raw venison. I put down a bowl of raw venison for him while I was rationing out the ZP. He pushed the raw venison chunks around and then looked at me and gave me that familiar nod as if to say "you gonna give me some of that?" No raw venison for him. Titan wanted his ZP and nothing more.

review/summary: Excellent food for allergic pets
review/text: My dog, Lucy, suffers from a host of allergies.  Of the higher quality dog foods on the market, Ziwi Peak is the only one without carrots or barley (two foods she cannot have).  Lucy loves this food and her allergies are much better--there are no grains, fillers, colors, preservatives or vegetables (I can give her those separately from home).  Without Ziwi peak I would be making stuff at home.  This is convenient and well worth the price--I only wish I could find a local retailer so I wouldn't have to order online...

With Ziwipeak, all the work has been done. Just scoop it out of the bag and into the dish and voila! A perfect and healthy meal. Happy dogs and happy me :-) I only wish it wasn't so expensive.

review/text: Tuffy, my 7 lb Pomeranian, has been the pickiest eater these 12 years and I have spent many hours searching for organic/natural products for him. It's been very difficult to find food he likes, but he went right to the venison and I am elated!<br /><br />I was unfamiliar with air-dried products and was surprised how dense the pieces are. He's eating a little more than recommended, but that's okay with me, it's good stuff.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product, not only because Tuffy likes it, but it is also a great value.

She didn't do well with many of the so-called organic products because they still contain a lot of low quality grains/starches.  Even better, there's less dog waste to clean up too because the product doesn't have useless fillers.

review/summary: Great raw food that dogs love...and grain free!!
review/text: We have loved ZiwiPeak for a few years now, when it was introduced to us by our local pet boutique.  (which is now out of business, unfortunately) It is available in venison, venison-fish, beef...and our dog loves all three, but due to past health issues we tend to stay with one of the 'venison' ones.  There is no odor, they look like little dried out beef jerky, but are not that hard.  They also have great treats.  It is a complete diet and it IS concentrated so feed only about 1/3 of what you would normally feed.  I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Pugs love ZiwiPeak!!!
review/text: A must have if you are looking for an alternative to a raw food diet.  Both of my pugs LOVE IT!  It is a little pricey, but you only use a tiny scoop for each portion for a small dog. WORD OF CAUTION: after using ZiwiPeak for several months, I noticed my dogs were gaining A LOT of weight.  You really have to stick to the manufacturers directions.  This is dehydrated food and a little goes a long way. I love too that they use ranch raised animals with no hormones or antibiotics or fresh fish not from farms.<br /><br />From the Raw Food Diet to ZiwiPeak:<br />After much research and debate with both my husband and my veterinarian, I decided to try a raw food diet.  Well, the raw meat was just nasty and my pug would go for several days without eating.  Proponents of the raw food diet say this is normal because the raw meat/bones took longer to digest, but truly, my dog just seemed ravenous.  Normally she was very polite when we ate, now she was begging and even jumping up trying to get food off of the table.  I just couldn't take any more.  Yes, her teeth were gorgeous and her digestion seemed better, but the poor dog seemed very unhappy with her food.  We tried to the frozen food that you thaw out and that worked okay for a while, a nice treat now and then...but then we found ZiwiPeak!

review/summary: Air Dried Venison Formula-Dogs Like It
review/text: I have been a raw feeder now for about a month. I've tried various high quality frozen and Freeze/Air-Dried dog food. I love ZiwiPeak's philosophy re quality and the ingredients seems to be top of the line. This is a nice idea for traveling with dogs who normally eat frozen raw (hard to go camping or car-tripping with frozen raw dog food). My Chow Chow first sniffed the food, walked away, then came back and ate it. My shih tzu walked away and left it (though she doesn't like dark meat generally - normally she eats fowl or rabbit - sometimes lamb). I am currently dog sitting for a poodle who will eat anything and he gobbled it right up. I may not purchase this product again simply because my dogs are really picky. But, I would purchase it if I had a dog like the poodle I am sitting for; as mentioned above, I feel this brand's ingredients are top of the line.

review/summary: 8 month Shih Tzu loves VENISON!!!
review/text: I guess my little pup went through what can be typical for the Shih Tzu breed to be a finicky eater.  He began walking away from his water moistened dry food: Blue Buffalo puppy, Nutro, Merrick (all of the same flavors).  I got this as my cousin had sent me some venison jerky she makes for her Yorkie's and they love it.  I put half the serving size bowl of this down for my little Weston and he lapped it up, looking up at me lovingly for more.  I gave him the rest of the serving size and he galloped away with more energy (even MORE than he normally showed) and played hard, napped and his eliminations were smaller and neater to clean up.  It seems that he is getting more nourished and retaining the nutrients he needs.  His coat is even more soft and supple.  This is a great product to take on trips without any mess or extra bowls, etc to pack.  Thanks, ZiwiPeak!!!!

review/summary: Good supplement for raw diet
review/text: I originally purchased this product to serve as my dog's main food since he is allergy-prone with skin issues and a survivor of mast-cell tumor disease.The vet had recommended other "veterinary prescription" kibble(potato/ rabbit) which seemed to really slow down our dog's healing process and worse, seemed to be doing more harm than good .  After giving up on vet reco 6 months later, we started experimenting with a number of 'healthy' and 'raw' alternatives, I landed on this just before going 100% raw. Though I have since gone 100% raw and eliminated all grain and processed food from our dog's main diet (with vast noticeable improvements in his health), I still use this food as one of his acceptable 'treats' and when I'm behind in making his raw meals. The texture is the consistency of beef jerky and the pieces are cut pretty small (think holding a small strip between your thumb and index finger about half the size of a fortune cookie paper...  It would be great for training since they are small pieces to feed frequently and more moist than dry kibble. It may be pricey to use as a main food , but it was great quality and seemed to be trustworthy ingredient sources. He likes the taste a lot too... but I can't vouch for that part.

review/text: I purchased the pack of five for $23.59. what i got was one pack for 12.99.  when i went back to the site, i clicked on the pack of five and it took me to the page to order, but it didn't have the pack of five highlighted so i got the other.  i should have spotted that, but it was down lower than the screen.  it had the right type of cookie highlighted so i assumed(my favorite word)everything was correct.  this is the first time this has happened.  they need to fix this.  who would buy one package of cookies for almost half the cost of a pack of five.

review/text: An astonishingly delicious soft baked chocolate brownie cookie by Pepperidge Farm, at a great price of only 13.00 for 5 packages that normally go for $3.49 each through Amazon.com seeing it rarely if never goes on sale at the supermarket unlike Pepperidge Farm's Milano Brand Line of cookies and their Goldfish Crackers all of the time. Great purchase at the right price when available! ENJOY!!!

No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling.

review/text: This is the only kind of Pepperidge Farm cookies that I have had in my lifetime that are just terrible. Very strange...the chips are great, but the cookie part of, well, these cookies, has a nondescript, bland, processed/white-sugar taste. No, you cannot compare the taste to a sugar cookie- it's like an alien's version of a chocolate-chip cookie hastily made in order to use to lure a human to its/his/her spacecraft. The brown sugar is just not kickin' here, so just kick these to the curb.

When you consider that these normally cost you listed on bag @ $3.49/per, and generally never go on sale at the supermarket/grocery store unlike the Milano Brand line of cookies by Pepperidge Farm the price was right to quote the famous game show still on T.V. today.

review/summary: PEPPERIDGE FARM COOKIES, Mmmmmmmm
review/text: What can be said negative about Pepperidge Farm Cookies.....ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! These soft baked, milk chocolate variety from Pepperidge Farm comes with 8 deliciously decadent cookies per package with a total of 5 packages per order and is mouth watering for any cookie or chocolate lover period! To boot, since this type of variety of Pepperidge Farm Cookies NEVER goes on sale at the supermarket or grocery store(at least where I live) unlike Milano and their Goldfish Brands, it would cost you $3.49 per bag X5, for a total of $16.95. Except I pick these up all the time through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for anywhere between my most recent purchase for 5 bags @ $11.04-$11.82 in the past, so you can't go wrong! If the Warehouse Deals(when available) or straight Amazon have a listing available at a higher price then mentioned in this review, then BE PATIENT and rest assure that the price will come down and you'll snag a great bargain like I do all the time on a regular basis. Having some now, Mmmmm!

review/text: I love Pepperidge farm Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies. They make the perfect snack. While other cookies are hard and dry with the texture of sawdust these cookies taste great, and are soft like they've just come out of the oven.<br /><br />Downsides? Each cookie is 130 calories which is a lot for such a small cookie. Also these contain interesterified fats/oils which are chemically altered oils. Not really great for humans to consume.<br /><br />The result? I think I'll bake my own... Without the chemicals. It would probably be safer. 5 star taste. 2 star ingredients. Rating, Average.

review/summary: another amazing noodley experience
review/text: Those of you who know me know that I don't eat pasta or carbs and am forever on a quest to find noodle substitutes that don't feel like a compromise.  A couple of years ago I bought and reviewed a turning slicer, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Y9WHQ">World Cuisine A4982799 Tri-Blade Plastic Spiral Vegetable Slicer</a> which I still love and use frequently to turn assorted vegetables into great noodle alternatives.  Recently someone mentioned these kelp noodles and I decided to give them a try.  Oh my, these are phenomenal in every way.  Don't like to cook?  Don't worry, these noodles don't require cooking.  You CAN cook them, but you don't have to.  It has only been a couple of weeks since I've found them so I haven't tried a large assortment of recipes but everything I have tried so far has been fabulous.  Cold noodles with sesame sauce was a hit with everyone.  These noodles are slightly chewy like pasta but they are also kind of crunchy like bean sprouts.  They are thin like regular spaghetti and crystal clear like cellophane noodles.  In and of themselves they have a delicate and refreshing taste with no weird smell like some of those other noodle alternatives. They are a wonderful size and texture and they hold thick sauces really well.  Everyone who has tasted the cold noodles with sesame sauce has moaned with delight and licked their plate clean.  I've also tried these noodles with a ramp pesto (slightly spicier than a basil pesto) and they held up so well with that sauce, too. The Ramp pesto was another crowd pleaser.<br /><br />If you are on a lo carb diet or lo calorie diet or a raw diet, vegan diet, vegetarian diet, or lo cholesterol diet, these noodles are a must have item.  According to the package nutritional info, there are only around 20 calories in a pound of the noodles.  There is no sugar, no cholesterol and only 1 carb per serving (3 servings in the bag).  And they are made from sea kelp so they have lots of good nutrition.<br /><br />To be sure, I was VERY skeptical when I first tried them.  I can be VERY squemish about new foods, particularly some of these weird, healthy alternative foods.  I also have a very sensitive stomach that revolts easily when it is displeased with my menu choices.  I was so afraid that they would smell like old shoes or taste like that horrible stuff you have to drink before a colonoscopy, but to my surprise and delight, there is no smell and no weird taste to get used to and my stomach has remained quiet and satisfied. In fact, I am beginning to wonder if they are too good to be true.  The cynic in me is waiting for the other shoe to drop, so to speak.<br /><br />Its not simply that these noodles don't smell or taste bad, its that they actually are so so so GOOD and they are fun to eat.  They have a clean and refreshing quality to them. I am enjoying coming up with recipes to showcase them but honestly I am not sure if I can top the sesame sauce.  I have yet to try them with traditional Italian pasta sauces, but I have a feeling they would be great with a hearty marinara. They are a natural for all sorts of Asian cuisine.  I bet they'd make an amazing base for Pad Thai.  If you do try them and find recipes you like, please post back here and let me know.<br /><br />So, to recap (for those of you who don't like to read a lot of text):<br />no cooking required (but you CAN cook them)<br />taste great<br />unbelievably lo calorie<br />lo cholesterol<br />lo carb<br />no sugar<br />versatile<br />healthy<br />holds up well to sauces<br />no weird taste, texture or smell<br />much much much better than shirataki noodles (in my opinion)<br /><br />The Bottom Line: If you use these in place of pasta I am pretty sure you wont feel like you are settling for second best.  These are a class act.  Their only flaw seems to be the somewhat steep pricing, but isn't this true of all relatively new foods?

review/text: These things are a giggle!  I won't bore you with too much detail because the other reviewer has done a great job covering all the details.  I will say my husband and I are not particularly into Japanese cuisine or anything exotic yet we find these kelp noodles delightful in every way.  Your imagination will run riot with them!  There is nothing NOT to like because they have no flavor but will absorb any flavor you put them with.  When kept cold they are crunchy, when cooked with liquid they soften.  Delightful to look at and fun to eat. Best of all they are full of minerals - including iodine - which are good for you.  Don't be a chicken - buy these.  If you don't want the whole case offered here you can order just one package directly from Gold Mine.

review/summary: Absolutely fantastic noodles!
review/text: I recently tried a different brand of kelp noodles which I liked a lot. I found this brand on amazon and took a chance. I thought the first brand I tried was very good. These are excellent! Kelp noodles can have a bit of a crunch. These noodles seemed thinner than the first ones I tried, so while they still had a bite to them, they had a softer consistency. They are so easy to use. You just rinse them off and toss them into a stir fry. I have served them to my family with pasta sauce and meatballs. Tonight I basically cleared out my leftovers by tossing in pot roast shredded with its gravy, sauteed onions and tomatoes and spices. Delicious! Each serving is only 6 calories and 0 carbs. (1 gram carb + 1 gram fiber = 0 carbs)<br /><br />I am going to try these noodles with chicken tikka masala this week. I am sure it will be great!

review/text: I was interested in these noodles because of the low calorie count (20 per bag). While they never get as soft as pasta noodles, you can get them close by soaking them in hot water for about an hour to an hour and a half with about a tablespoon of vinegar or the juice of a lemon/lime.<br />The noodles don't really have a taste so you will have to make some kind of a sauce to put on them. I usually make asian dishes with these noodle.<br />This is a great price for these noodles.

review/summary: Health warning to all
review/text: I loved these noodles. Found they absorb flavors very well and soften when boiled. However, something did not seem right about the nutritional content. I found a video on YouTube ([...]) and discussion forums that discuss these noodles. It turns out that these noodles are mainly made of sodium alginate, a highly processed derivative of kelp. The kelp undergoes a lot of chemical treatment including some at high temperatures to made this powder, which of course resembles the noodles a lot more than does kelp itself. In all likelihood very little of the nutritional value of kelp makes it into these noodles. It is used in the food industry as a gum, but please consider that you are eating a large amount of it in the noodles. It is not good for people with hypertension and people have ended up with upset tummies. Besides we don't really know what the long term consequences of eating this stuff are. It is unfortunate that they can even sell this product. I was not looking for raw food (which it is not), only something low calorie. Now I also am left with several bags that I will have to throw out.

That's the type of crunchy these noodles are when eaten raw.<br /><br />Not the least bit slimy.  No funny chemical smell coming out of the bag.  You can actually chew them (ergo the spider crunch) unlike the shiritaki noodles.<br /><br />Next time, I'll try simmering them for an hour or so with some acid, as a previous reviewer recommends.

review/summary: A Great Replacement for Conventional Noodles
review/text: If you cannot or should not or prefer not to have wheat or rice (or any other type of grain) noodles, these Gold Mine Kelp Noodles are a great alternative.  I'm not saying that they have the same taste or texture as the other types, however, when I want to eat noodles in either a marinara sauce, a Thai red curry sauce or a pesto sauce (3 of my favorites), these seem to do the trick and are quite satisfying...not to mention incredibly healthy, especially for those of you that may have thyroid issues (it's the naturally occurring iodine that is very beneficial).  They are just as good as the Sea Tangle Noodles in case you are wondering as well.  The more acidic the sauce, the softer the noodle will become.  So they will be a bit "crunchier" in the pesto vs the tomato based sauce. They can have a somewhat bitter taste and I'm not sure if rinsing them more thoroughly makes any difference, but surely the sauce you choose will make a difference.  I prefer to eat them hot vs cold or room temp.  Enjoy&#8260;!

review/summary: Very Filling (and it's a vegetable)
review/text: LWM already provided a great review but I'd through I'd add a few other points.<br /><br />- 1 Package contains a healthy serving (split for lunch and dinner or between two people).<br />- I'd liken the texture to having a distinct bite but not necessarily crunchy (e.g., potato chips) when cooked<br />- Because they contain no "taste" it should be accompanied with protein, light sauce or salad dressing that is well seasoned<br />- Great for a quick meal (boil kelp, add protein and "salad" ingredients) or late night meal without the guilt.<br /><br />Amazon's pricing is aligned with Whole Paycheck (20-cent difference) but at the Asian market they are priced between $1.50 and $2.99 depending on brand/country origin and weight. The 16-ounce pack should not be more than $2 for a case. I would recommend potential purchasers to buy one pack before committing to the case. Also, there are several sites (raw food or paleo based) that include good recipes to make the experience better. Finally, I'd avoid using kelp for a traditional (baked) spaghetti or tomato sauce-heavy dishes. Remember this a vegetable and not a starch. The results will not be the same.

review/text: I love Thai food and I use the noodles with many Thai recipes. Also, Once you cook them in red curry, they soften quite a lot.

review/summary: Beats the competition!
review/text: I don't often give 5 star reviews, but I really like this product.<br /><br />I recently tried the "Miracle Noodle," and these, and the kelp noodle is far better. Why?<br /><br />1.  Kelp noodles can be prepared with a slight crunch akin to a bean sprout, or cooked tender like a glass noodle<br />2. Kelp noodles aren't shipped in a smelly liquid.  Not only is it unpleasant, but the liquid is drained down the sink, so much of what you pay for is wasted.<br />3. Since you use almost all of the product that ships, that makes kelp noodles a better value.<br /><br />Yes, these have a few more calories than miracle noodle, but it's negligible in comparison to rice noodles. These really are a nice addition to a weight loss plan. I use them in stir fries at least once a week. I don't find any of these low cal noodles suitable for Italian style dishes.

review/summary: another good way to lose weight
review/text: They need a lot of cooking before they get soft, they remeind me of bean sprouts with that type of fresh crunch if you dont' cook them long enough. It's nice to have some kind of noodles to eat when you're trying to lose weight. I also like miracle noodles , but these are a better deal for the price.

review/summary: Gold Mine Kelp Noodles
review/text: I am really liking these noodles.  I can have crunch in my diet without the guilt. Have gone through 2 packages already since I received them last week.  Latest meal was a shrimp scampi.  Rinsed the noodles and put them in the sauce a few minutes before putting the shrimp in.  It gave them enough time to absorb the flavor and not let the shrimp get rubbery.  They even reheated well.  These will be my go-to noodles now.

review/text: I was a little worried about this after trying the shirataki noodles.  But these have no smell!  They taste great!  I ate them in a Thai wrap.  They have a nice crunch and taste like jicama.  Haven't tried them in anything hot yet, but I'm looking forward to it.

review/text: I wanted to try these kelp noodles, and when I ordered I didn't realize I was ordering 2 packs of 6!  What a great price!  They are delicious; I used some in a noodle salad and it came out great.  I am going to have to do some web surfing to come up with some more creative ways to use them.  Crunchy, healthful, and absorb flavors of whatever you mix them with.  Thanks!  Fast shipping.

review/summary: Not Good :(
review/text: I spent a LONG time reading all reviews of many kelp noodles.  Talked to raw foodie friends and went on sites regarding best preparation.  With that in mind, I prepared a yummy sesame ginger sauce, let the noodles sit over night after rinsing them well, etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />Result - crunchy badness.  Sorry but there it is.  I tried to give them away at work - a holistic medical practice - no-one wanted them.<br /><br />Poop!

review/summary: Noodles COVERED IN MOLD, completely inedible.
review/text: Our first order of these noodles were really good, excited to get more.<br /><br />Second order, huge disappointment.  The noodles have mold spores all over them and we opened one to be sure, it REEKS OF MOLD.<br /><br />Hardest time trying to return these, Amazon doesn't make it easy to contact them.  These items are classified as non-returnable.  However, after searching and searching, I finally found the Amazon contact information and spoke to their customer service department.  They apologized and refunded my money with no further delay.

review/summary: Very Nice Medium Roast Flavor
review/text: To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words "Medium Extra Bold" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Amazon should correct that description  and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other.

review/summary: My Favorite by a Landslide so Far
review/text: I must admit that I have gone a little overboard with my k-cup sampling.  So far I must have tried about 50 different blends.  OVerall I must say that the vast majority of them have been pleasant, better than what I used to make in my coffee brewer.  Then I tried the Donut Shop brand.  When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about.  When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing.  Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe.  My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day.  Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one.  It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite.  I will still search for something better, but I doubt I will find it.  I hope you like -- no strike that -- I hope you love this coffee as much as I do.

review/summary: Great Coffee--competetive price!
review/text: I've had my Keurig brewer for 5 months and have tried a lot of brands and the Coffee People Donut Shop regular is among my favorites. Green Mountain Nantucket Blend and Timothy's Italian Blend are also favorites.<br /><br />One reviewer remarked about Subscribe & Save costing less. It's only a dollar and a few pennies cheaper than this packaging and Subscribe and Save does not offer Donut Shop "regular" but instead has "Extra Bold". Also, this packaging gives you 50 k-cups as opposed to 48 (2) 24 count packages in Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about not having the standard boxes to dispense the coffee. I purchased a K-Cup carousel, available on Amazon for $19.95 that holds 26 k-cups; it looks nicer by my Keurig than cardboard boxes.

review/summary: Wake Up To Caffienated Perfection!
review/text: We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year, so we've been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible. This coffee is -- BAR NONE -- the best of the bunch. It is rich, syrupy and just a bit sweet. My experience, thus far, has been that the K-Cups listed as "extra bold" produce the best cups of coffee, but many of those are only available in dark roasts, while I prefer a medium roast. If you're a fan of a good, old fashioned diner-style cup of coffee (like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that), then this is the brew for you. We love it and make sure we always have some on hand.
