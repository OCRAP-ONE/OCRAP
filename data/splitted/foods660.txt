review/summary: Good things come in small packages
review/text: When I first got this container of Matcha I thought it was a lot to pay for such a small container. Let me tell you..a little bit goes a long way! Matcha green tea is also much more flavourful than brewing tea from a teabag.  I have also found many recipes that call for green tea powder and this has worked out well. I would say the price I paid is well worth the wonderful matcha that I purchased.

review/summary: Food grade matcha?
review/text: I found the matcha to be very bitter and grainy. I had few bowls but it ended up being used to cookies which were very tasty. Also made some smoothies with honey added and they were a hit.<br />I didnt buy from amazon. I got mine from a tea shop in chinatown for $5/can. I wanted to see if you really get what you pay for.<br />I have been buying my matcha directly from japan(yuuki-cha, ippodo,o-cha) and i dont think its fair to compare since they cost $20-30/can.<br />if you are looking for a serious drinking tasteful matcha stay away from this one. But as culinary grade matcha its certainly a good value.

review/text: When I received it and soon after opened it, the matcha appears a pale green, as if it has been sitting in storage too long before they sent it. DoMatcha, on the other hand, when I first bought it was bright green and fresher.<br /><br />Not into this brand --  I prefer DoMatcha. . .

review/summary: Rather disappointing
review/text: Being new to matcha, I bought two types to sample, this and the ingredient grade matcha from MatchaSource. I opened the MatchaSource one first and found it delicious, bright green, lovely flavour, dissolves well if you follow the instructions and dissolve in a little hot water before adding the milk. Then I tried this one, and was quite disappointed, the powder is sage green in colour, produces a grey-brown tea with very little flavour and the powder never quite dissolves.  Not at all what I was expecting given my experience with the MatchaSource tea. Between the two, this will not be the one that I buy again. Nice tin, though.

review/summary: Not the best -actually awful
review/text: I made a cup of my usual..using preheated steamed frothed milk, this "maccha" green tea powder  and sometimes a little Stevia. YUCK.<br /><br />I paid $14.99 at an Asian store for this. The Eden $36 a can was much much much better...you can get that $27 or $29 a can in bulk.  I've ordered some stuff from Japan..Ryu-Mei. I'll let you know how this works out when it arrives.<br /><br />I guess if you just want to add powder to regular tea to make yourself feel better about the added health benefits this would be ok. If you hate the green twiggy matcha taste, this is ok.<br /><br />This is probably ok as ingredient grade. Or if you like iced tea...<br /><br />This is a sage green powder color ground very fine.<br />Tastes like ground BROWN tea. YUCK.<br />Nothing like the "Green" in Eden's Spring matcha.<br /><br />The tin comes with a bag inside and a preservative (oxygen destroyer pack). You open the bag when you are ready to serve. Then dump the contents in the tin.<br /><br />To each his own, this is not for me.

review/summary: Tasty... but has MSG
review/text: Recently my grocer stopped carrying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XIZMQ">Mahatma Saffron Yellow Rice</a> so I decided to try Goya Spanish Style Yellow rice.<br /><br />Goya comes in a box, but is prepared much the same as the other yellow rices.  You bring 2 cups of water to boil, add 1 tablespoon of oil (or butter) and the rice packet.  You then boil for one minute and then reduce the heat, for 25 minutes.<br /><br />The result was a flavorful, fairly fluffy rice which my family liked.  My husband in particular liked it, and commented that is seemed less salty than the other brands -- 860mg per 45 grams or 1/4 cup.  And it was certainly good with the Kielbasa I served it with.<br /><br />Those with allergies to MSG take note.  This product has it.  In addition, the manufacturer uses Yellow Dye #5, and the rice MAY also contain, milk, egg, wheat, soybean, tree nuts, crustacean and fish bits, which freaks me out a bit, because it sounds like they have no production control at all.<br /><br />So, though tasty, we won't be purchasing Goya Yellow Rice again because of the MSG, the Yellow chemical dye, and because of the possibility that it might be contaminated with nuts :(<br /><br />Not Kosher.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/allergy sufferer and principle cook<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:::<br />Rice Long Grain Parboiled ( Iron, Niacin, Thiamine (Thiamin), Folic Acid (Vitamin aB) ), Chicken Bouillon ( Soy Protein Hydrolyzed, Salt, Monosodium Glutamate, Sugar, Maltodextrin, Flavor(s) Chicken ( Soy Protein Hydrolyzed, Salt, Chicken Fat, Yeast Extract, Flavor(s) Natural, Silicon Dioxide Added To Prevent Caking, Chicken Powder, Disodium Inosinate, Disodium Guanylate ), Soy Protein Hydrolyzed, Soybean(s) Oil Hydrogenated, Onion(s), Yeast Extract, Chicken Fat ( Chicken Fat Rendered, Annatto, BHA, BHA, Celery, Chicken ( Citric Acid ), Citric Acid ), Pepper(s) Bell Dehydrated, Onion(s) Dehydrated, Garlic, Garlic, Milk Non-Fat Dry Solids, Parsley, Propyl Gallate, Propyl Gallate, Salt, Silicon Dioxide Added To Prevent Caking, Yellow 5, Chicken Cooked, Silica, Coriander<br /><br />MAY CONTAIN::<br />Milk, egg, wheat, soybean, tree nuts, crustacean shell fish, and fish.

review/summary: Best Licorice ever!
review/text: So, I've been a fan of licorice for decades, and tried too many brands.  This one is a standout! Rich licorice flavor, chewy but neither rock hard or too soft.  Hard to find - I've literally gone to Cost Plus MANY times, seen full racks of other brands, and this specific formulation always sells out - and is hard to find. Now I get it on the 'Net.  Other formulations by Katjes are not as good, in my view.

review/summary: My dog loves them!
review/text: I have a GSD/lab mix with a bazillion allergies. I've cut out just about every allergen (most of which was not for dogs anyway) in her diet. I feel fully comfortable giving her these treats, and she LOVES them.<br /><br />For those people with severe allergy dogs, I want you to know that her itching has not stopped, just by using these treats. It is believed that she has environmental allergies too. However, the food allergy part (that was giving her massive ear infections) has, knock on wood, not returned. I also switched her food to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RO7AVM">Natural Choice Grain Free Venison and Potato</a>, so I think that these treats, combined with her food, has been a success, even if she still itches.<br /><br />Her itching is puzzling though because I did note a serious coat change when she started using these. It adds a teensy bit of an oily gloss and makes it look very healthy. Her "dandruff" has also disappeared, so it makes for a good moisturizer for dry skin, which is what I thought was causing the itching. Evidently not.<br /><br />These are small treats, about 1"x0.5". Though they are small, these are not good trainer treats due to the Omegas in them. These are just good old fashioned healthy snacks, like a human's raw vegetable snack.<br /><br />Okay, so all that said, check your prices. I have a 14-oz bag that I got at Petsmart on sale for about $8. That is significantly cheaper than here. Even if not on sale, I will buy them for all the reasons I've listed above.<br /><br />I read a review on these that said there is no odor. Maybe I'm overly sensitive, but there is a definite odor and it is not a pleasant one. It's not a powerful scent, but it is definitely there. Keep in mind that stinky dog treats are treats your dog will likely prefer over those that don't stink. After all they're dogs. They like stinky stuff. lol!<br /><br />I wanted to also mention that I see at their website (which is actually cardinalpet) that they do NOT use any Diamond facilities, in case any were wondering. I cannot vouch for that, but is just another FYI. Also, and this is fair warning, it says that they are a 'Product of China'.<br /><br />I noticed that Amazon does not give you very much information on the treats here, so let me give you what you're probably wanting to know, since I just happen to have a pack sitting right here.<br /><br />I think Amazon should require food sellers to provide nutritional data for humans and pet food. Don't you? It's too bad we have to do that for them. :(<br /><br />== Per their package (none of these are my comments) ==<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Salmon, sweet potato, cod, cane sugar, glycerin, salt, potassium sorbate and mixed tocopherals (vitamin E).<br /><br />These dog treats are designed and formulated using 100% food grade ingredients and produced in facilities that only make food quality products.<br /><br />Cane sugar and salt are part of a natural preservative system.<br /><br />DOES NOT CONTAIN<br />wheat, soybean, lechithin, BHA, BHT, ethoxyquin, artificial flavor, gluten or grains.<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br />Crude protein 10.0% (min)<br />crude fat 3.0% (min)<br />crude fiber 1.0%<br />moisture 16.0%<br />omega 3* 0.15%<br />omega 6* 0.40%<br />* Nutrient is not recognized as essential by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles.<br /><br />CALORIE CONTENT<br />8.6 Kcal per treat/ 2400 Kcal/kg<br /><br />== end package ==<br /><br />I do highly recommend these treats and give it the full 5-stars that it deserves.

review/text: I love sweet potatoes and it's hard to find sweet-potato cake mix, so I was excited to make this. I grated half a raw sweet potato into the mix and let the batter sit a while as the box suggested (optional) before baking.  The cake came out moist, dense, and full of sweet-potato flavor -- but way too sweet, even when on another try I added oat bran for a healthier version. Sugar content isn't numerically higher than other cake mixes (22 grams per serving) but the TASTE is way sweeter.  Maybe that's not a bad thing if it satisfies your sweet tooth with just a small sliver at a time.

review/text: One star is too generous. I love the tea and hate the seller. I ordered 6 packs of twining tea. The first seller I chose had a 6 pack and each pack with 20 bags. The next search was for the same deal and it even listed as a 6 pack. Now that I got the package I see it's one lousy box of 20 bags for more than $19. What an incredible rip off. Last time for Shaqdis Books and Marketplace for me.

review/summary: This is intense stuff
review/text: Since I am a teetotaler, I haven't tried this in the various cocktails where it is featured (just search the 'net for recipes). I love bitters in club soda. This product has a VERY intense lavender flavor, and I personally found that it was almost too floral to be drunk with soda. I did add some orange bitters and that helped. I think that these bitters will be perfect in cooking (I'm thinking lavender ice cream...) and perhaps as an herbal component, much like lavender in herbs de provence. If you love lavender you will very pleased. A little goes a long ways, so this bottle will last and last.

review/text: The Red Sea Salt has a earthy flavor; it is slower to dissolve on the tongue.  It is a beautiful, unexpected hue, and surprised and delighted my dinner guests--none had ever tasted it before!  I used a light sprinkling on my endive salad (along with pepper) and it looked exotic and tasted amazing!~

review/text: This salt has a great flavor.  It is a little coarser than I expected and is slow to dissolve, but it give a nice salty burst of flavor with just a hint of something more.  A little goes a long way.  I think this salt is wonderful on fish and beef.  I was very pleased with my order from DAS Salt/DAS Foods - fast shipping, great product, pleasant thank you note and samples included with my order.  Although it's not inexpensive, an order of gourmet salts is well worth it from this company.

review/summary: I don't get it
review/text: A few years ago we received a gift of salt someone brought us from Hawaii.  A beautiful salt that was a pink/beige color, a great texture and size, and lovely taste that enhanced all food.  It came in a baggie...sigh.  I've been looking to replace it ever since so I thought I'd try this salt.  My honest reaction about this salt - I don't get it.  I like the course texture of the salt.  It's a bit more chunky then we like though you do feel it when you eat.  The taste?  Here it is, I don't get it.  There is a critical mass point putting this salt on your food - and what we feel is that it's nothing or simply too much.  I know, I'm giving a lot of words here.  It's just that there are all these great reviews of how amazing it is.  The salt is kind of tasteless on the finger.  On food it seems to need a lot and then ICK!!!!  So my recommendation is a 3 because maybe we simply haven't found the exact amount to use to create the taste everyone is raving about.  I keep trying and it's either no taste at all or so over powering the food is awful.  For the price I'm tossing it in the garbage because it's too much a pain at meal time when I'm trying to figure it out.  I can't say it's awful because maybe it's us.  We are salt lovers and we buy and understand salt.  This salt?  I don't get it.  And that is actually saying something.  So I guess I'll take a stand and say - we don't like it.  I've tried it on simple and complex food and recipes.  Too risky when time is so busy these days to have to find a balance of the amount you use.  Going back to Morton's course kosher salt or our sea salt bought locally in Maine until I find that salt that matches the gift from Hawaii...

review/summary: A very welcome addition to my kitchen
review/text: I've been using this red sea salt for a few years when i work (I'm a chef). The flavor is really bright and enhances quite a few dishes, from meats to veggies and even desserts. I decided to buy some for my home recently here. I find it is better used as a finisher, i.e.  sprinkled on foods. I also use it in seafood rubs quite often. My favorite uses are sprinkled on fresh veggies such as cucumber slices and heirloom tomatoes, on chocolate/caramel dishes, and used with seafood. I have several salts, so i generally use this for those three purposes, but sometimes, I'll add it to other dishes as well. It doesnt really dissolve quickly (probably due to the red clay which gives it its color), so it is better used in dishes where that isnt an expectation. Otherwise, it is multifunctional and i think you'll like it. Enjoy!

Easy recipe too, rub this salt and a bit of liquid smoke on the pork shoulder or butt and throw into a crockpot.  Let it cook on low for about 20 hours and turn once during that time.

review/text: I debated buying this, as it's rather expensive. I'm glad I got it. It's highly flavorful and more effective than a similar amount of table salt. And since you need so little, it'll last much longer than the small container would make you think. The flavors have more depth than some other sea salts, but they aren't as overwhelming as the truly dark salts. The red color lends beauty to your finished dish. Keep in mind that this is intended as a finishing salt---something to be sprinkled in small amounts over a finished dish---not as a substitute for salt called for in a recipe.

review/summary: Earth of the Salt
review/text: Alaea sea salt contains traces of red clay from the Hawaiian pools where it is condensed. That explains its color, its slowness to dissolve, and its flavor. I have no idea whether the clay adds any nutritional value to the salt, but it has a certain Biblical resonance. "Clay thou art, Adam!" In fact, the name 'adam' is derived from the Hebrew word for clay.<br /><br />This is the only 'boutique' sea salt I've come upon that seems well worth the extra cost. It's extremely tasty on heirloom tomatoes. It looks appetizing on steaks and chops, sprinkled at the last moment before serving. It's something to reserve for "finishing" and "plating" food. A six-ounce jar will last a long time in most kitchens, so this is a decent value.<br /><br />If you live in the South, you might try sprinkling alaea sea salt on the tail of the next ivory-billed woodpecker or Carolina parroquet you see, as a means of clearing the land for development.

review/text: My husband loves his crackers and he was lamenting one day that the Costco crackers (Premium, big box) just didn't taste as fresh the last time we purchased them, so I went on a cracker buying spree trying to find the ultimate cracker. Lots of taste testing. Bottom line? A cracker, is a cracker, is a cracker. They are all pretty tasty, from the Keebler to the Krispy and the several in between. He liked this brand, but felt they were expensive compared to the Krispy crackers since the taste between the two was almost indistinguishable and the Krispy's were cheaper.<br /><br />BUT, and this is a big BUT...these are ORGANIC! Living in a farming community, I've seen the chemicals poured on wheat when it goes into storage bins (to deter bugs), and believe me, you don't want to eat non-organic wheat. ACK! The stench of the chemical permeates the air surrounding the grain bins when they are pouring that stuff on it. Why we as people poison our food before we eat it--I'll never get that.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good cracker and I would recommend this product if you want a healthier wheat product--the taste is delicious.

review/summary: The basic soda cracker had it all.
review/text: Reviews on this cracker are delightfully enthusiastic and helpful. A comment by Anne Smiley under Sally Boyd's review intrigued me by noting that the Back to Nature Brand is made by Kraft.<br /><br />If this is so, I wonder why KRAFT didn't think of making [or returning] their name brand cracker like this BACK TO NATURE offering, light and airy MINUS soy and the extra non essential ingredients which take away from flavor, take away from nutrition, and cause people like me to lose faith in name brand foods, indeed to lose faith in and almost dread buying and eating most foods from grocery stores and restaurants, people like me who have been harmed by long term assimilation of anti-nutritional "extras"?<br /><br />I think I know some of the answers to those questions, figuring out some of it on my own, then adding weight to some of my speculations by reading articles like "THE DARK SIDE OF CINDERELLA" by Doctors Mary Enig and Sally Fallon [that article can be read on Dr. Mercola's web site], and by reading books and perusing web sites by honorable medical professionals like Bruce Fife, Carolyn Dean, Mark Sircus, and many more.<br /><br />I know it's hard these days when no one knows what's truly healthy, but too many think they know, and force their "knowledge" into the food chain, while attempting to block alternatives. It's hard not only for consumers searching for food which is honestly healthy; it's difficult for food manufacturers and purveyors as well to know what to offer how.<br /><br />Maybe it's wise to focus on what has been remedied to the best interests of all, with products like this soda cracker, however it's packaged, whatever brand it holds, if it's made of only basic, simple, essential whole food ingredients, without adding excess toxic baggage.<br /><br />I like the brand name, packaging, and especially the taste/texture quality of this soda cracker which takes me back to simple days when I was very young...<br /><br />As I began writing this, I was spoon sipping a delicious bowl of steaming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM2PH0">Wolfgang Puck Organic Creamy Tomato soup</a>. Each sip contained a few crumbled pieces of these crackers, which I continued adding a few at a time to keep them somewhat crisp.<br /><br />If that flavor, texture, and process doesn't conjure the cozy home feel of "all's right with the world"... I don't know what would.<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon for making this treat so easily available to me at quantity prices.  Thank you Back to Nature, or Kraft, or both, all who went into allowing me to enjoy this at my kitchen table when my husband was on the road somewhere checking for parts and machinery for equipment for the coal mine where he works.<br /><br />He called me from the road as I was slurping, so I placed the remaining soup in the fridge to concentrate on his voice, knowing the creamy tomato soup made right by these classic saltine crackers would be waiting for me when his voice was temporarily gone again.<br /><br />Real soda crackers are one of the simplest, most basic of comfort foods. They're something to cherish in their simplest natural state. To add anything more to that completeness feels like an incomprehensible intrusion to me.<br /><br />So thankful that righteous minimalism has found its way home again,<br />Linda Shelnutt

review/text: I was in the grocery store a few weeks ago and found that all the Saltines had chemicals, preservatives, etc.  Some of them deadly.  For example, sodium bisulfite which will keep an apple white for three months.  Never used to be in Saltines and now is.<br /><br />Purchased the Back to Nature Organic Saltines.  They are absolutely perfect.  We are on our fourth case.  Some saltines do not have soda in them - they are useless for any acid reflux sufferer but Back to Nature Organic Saltines do have soda and  I noticed I was able to cut back on my Gavison. This is not medical advice but the crackers work for my family.  Taste great, not too salty and we intend to purchase them on a regular basis.<br /><br />It is getting more and more difficult to find chemical free products.  Thanks to amazon for helping its customers find products that we can feel good about eating.

review/text: Much like others have said here, I absolutely love saltines but due to the terrible ingredients I just could not buy them anymore. While there are plenty of good healthy crackers on the market these days, none come close to the classic saltine style I grew up with - until these. They really taste just like the classics. Simple and healthful ingredients, a perfect texture - no weird overly crispiness or off tastes. Great plain, with a little cheese or tossed on top of a bowl of soup. These 8 ounce boxes contain 2 separate packages of crackers, much like the classic boxes in stores today would have 4 packages (though these are a little shorter). Highly recommended.

The rocks were needed for a fun way to introduce science lab books to a group of fifth graders. Do be careful from whom you order.

review/summary: I am addicted to this coffee! NOT bitter or too strong with great flavor!
review/text: I am very picky with coffee. I really dislike the super strong blends that leave a nasty aftertaste, are bitter, and require lots of cream to stomach. According to a recent Starbucks survey 40% of Americans actually don't like the super strong bold type coffee - well count me as part of that 40%. I like a mild to medium blend with a nice flavor without any bitterness.<br /><br />I've tried MANY of the mild or medium roast blends. Until I found Caribou Coffee  I thought there was nothing out there for me - and I did all sorts of things just to have a cup of joe to enjoy (mixing hot water in, adding flavored creamers, and so on). I alternate this coffee with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O62H5E">Caribou Coffee Blend Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>. Both are outstanding. I've bought bag after bag of this and it's always the same great coffee. Not the cheapest coffee - but for me absolutely worth the price. No need for any flavored creamers - this one has fantastic flavor on its own!

They are both great on just a cracker with cream cheese, but I did make a<br />milkshake with the pineapple and it was about the best thing I've ever had.<br /><br />But these Pears, WOW! Reminds me of the preserves my grandmother and mom made. They<br />are packed with fruit, are just sweet enough, and have that wonderful velvety consistency<br />all good preserves should have. I reserve these strictly for buttered biscuits, croissants,<br />and toast, but I'm sure there are a dozen other uses.<br /><br />Its a small company that prides itself in quality and creativity.

review/summary: No added salt is a big plus
review/text: Yep, this is A LOT of curry powder, but if you use it often in cooking, it really is a better price than paying several dollars for a tiny bottle (even McCormick's own tiny bottle) that'll be gone in no time - or worse, make you feel like you have to ration it.  I like curry powder and for once in my life, I wanted to use it and not feel I must skimp.  I paid just under $11 and in about a month, I've used maybe 3/4 of an ounce (I saved an empty 1 oz bottle to keep a more manageable portion on the spice rack).  Like another reviewer said, it IS possible it tastes a bit different from the 1 oz version, but I couldn't say for certain, and moreover, I don't think it's bad - I'm using it, mainly on rice dishes.  To me, it's legions better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007B9JCFM">Taste Specialty Foods Hot Curry Powder, 16-Ounce</a> but not as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MXTMZO">Rajah Mild Madras Curry Powder 100g</a>.<br /><br />Google "curry powder health benefits" and you'll find plenty of results; it's best known for its benefits to digestion and for anti-inflammatory qualities, but also said to boost memory and protect against Alzheimer disease and cancer.<br /><br />Ingredients: Coriander, Fenugreek, Turmeric, Cumin, Black Pepper, Bay Leaves, Celery seed, Nutmeg, Cloves, Onion, Red Pepper, Ginger.<br /><br />The expiration, I'm pleased to note since there is so darn much of this(!), is April 2014.

review/text: I have been drinking Whey Up since 2007 and I LOVE IT!  There is not another protein energy drink on the market that tastes as good or works as well.  I drink at least one Whey UP a day and can certainly feel my energy levels increase when i drink it before a work out.  It's also been a great source of meal replacement with 20g of protein and again, it tastes GREAT!<br /><br />I even pack bottles of WHEYUP when I travel and have gone to great measures to get more WHEY UP if i run out.  People who work out should drink WHEYUP for the protein energy boost they get before going to the gym.  I have also pointed out to people that are dieting that they should drink WHEYUP as a meal replacement (once a day) and then keep filling the bottle with water for the rest of the day.<br /><br />I love that AMAZON is now selling WHEY UP and everyone should try it!

review/text: I discovered WheyUp 4 years ago after having bariatric surgery. It's a challenge to consume 60 grams of protein when your stomach is the size of a golf ball. Protein drinks are one of the best ways. The problem is, I hated the taste of every one... until WheyUp! I love the taste and I also love the caffeine. Having reached my goal weight, the challenge to ingest enough protein is still there! I like to have 1/2 before my morning workout and the other 1/2 immediately after.<br />I almost didn't write this review because I'm selfish and I wanted to make sure it's always in stock!

review/text: I grabbed one of these at QT a few days ago, and have loved them ever since.  As I'm writing this, they're unavailable on amazon, but I'm diligently checking as I'll be ordering a lot when they start selling them.<br /><br />I use this as a light, high protein pre workout drink, and I love that it has caffeine as that really helps me push myself in my early morning workouts.  I've tried milk+whey, but it was too heavy for me and always seemed to sit on my stomach and make me feel sluggish as I was trying to lift.  I've also tried water+whey, but mannnn that tastes horrendous and I just have a hard time doing it.  And neither of those have caffeine, which I think really helps to energize me.  So far I've tried the grape and berry, and liked both.  I haven't tried any of the other flavors.<br /><br />This does taste a little tiny bit bitter at times, and definitely isn't as good tasting as a protein shake, but it's perfect otherwise.  And you're not really drinking it for the taste anyways, are you?  Grab one of these, lift a lot of heavy weight up and down as many times as you can, follow up with a post-workout shake, rest and repeat, and you'll get strong.  Highly recommended!

review/text: My old favorite was Jasmine tea but ever since someone gave me one of these teabags to try this has been my new favorite.  I love the taste and aroma, although if you don't keep it in an airtight container it loses its potency.  Regardless, I need to order the 100 teabag size everytime because I go through it quite often.  This last time I ordered from Sadaf directly, they sent me a keychain and a tiny box of Special Blend with Cardamom (5 teabags).  I really appreciated that.  It's little things like that which will keep me coming back - even if I don't enjoy the Cardamom Tea sample!  I didn't realize Amazon sold this brand and I hope they get some of this in soon.<br /><br />FYI - I noticed on the Sadaf website that they now have a Special Blend Jasmine tea as well.  I'm definitely going to try that next time I order some of my Special Blend with Earl Grey!<br /><br />Also, as a side note, I drink this sometimes with a little lemon juice and sometimes with a tiny amount of orange juice added.  Either way it's delicious and unique... as it is just plain.

I'm also working on a white chocolate recipe and cinnamon roll frosting with them. Very good for the money.

review/summary: Love it
review/text: Love it! My favorite usage of this wonderful product is to add it to my morning porridge. For example, try semolina/yellow corn grits/cocoa butter chips or semolina/barley/cocoa butter chips. Of course you add the chips when the porridge is ready, you don't cook them. Enjoy!

review/text: I love chai and raspberries, put together they are heavenly.  Big Train makes many drinks that I like, and this is no exception, in fact this may be my favorite.  There is convenience in the single serving, and the price through Amazon is much better than I could get locally.
