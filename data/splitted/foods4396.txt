review/text: I had Tasty Bite Punjab Eggplant that I picked up from Target under 3 bucks; inexpensive and yummy.  Very similar to Kashk Bademjan I had at a local restaurant.  Great with some pita bread/chips, or raw carrots, etc.

review/summary: Great product, unpredictable price
review/text: This is one of my favorites of the Tasty Bite entrees; it's wonderfully flavorful and, as other reviewers have pointed out, it's a terrifically convenient option for folks on a vegan diet. My favorite way to eat it is over quinoa or brown rice, topped with chopped black olives. Hmm, it's just occurred to me that it would probably be excellent over pasta as well (with the olives)--a sort of Indian/Italian fusion. I used to purchase this product from Amazon via Subscribe & Save, and it was a great deal. Unfortunately, the price is now more than 30% higher than it was when I first subscribed--it's now actually cheaper for me to buy it from my local supermarket. Amazon, if you'll make the price competitive again, I'll subscribe again!

review/text: I keep a few of these in my desk at work for days when I don't feel like going out to lunch. They are super convenient because you can microwave them as is, just tear open slightly to vent and put in the microwave. No bowl required, just a spoon, or in a pinch, tilt your head back and slurp it!<br /><br />The taste is great. I love Indian food, and I love vegetables so this is perfect for me. The only thing to mention is that one of my co workers complained about the smell, but he's that sorta complainy person who doesn't eat Indian food and prefers Burger King. It tastes great, smells great, and is super convenient.

The cracked pepper has a slightly sweet hint which I find interesting and took a bit to get used to. I would buy again, its too bad you can't subscribe.

review/text: Saw these chips on Dr. Oz as an alternative to potato chips.  These chips work for me, but not my husband.  The chips have a light flavor, are crunchy and have a puffed texture.  I have just ordered my 2nd box of the 1 oz size to control my portion size because  I don't trust myself to stop eating before the bag is empty.  I hope this becomes a regular Amazon item that I can subscribe to and get Super Saver Delivery.

review/text: We discovered these as one of the snacks sent by a diet my husband was on.  They're good enough we then looked them up ourselves.  They're cheaper per ounce in the larger bags, but the 1oz bags are great for potion control.  All three flavors available on Amazon are delicious; my husband's favorite is the cracked pepper.  The rosemary is a reasonably strong taste, so I would recommend liking rosemary if you order it.<br /><br />I make fat free 'hummus' to serve with them (no sesame/tahini or olive oil, so it's not quite traditional, but that's necessary to cut the fat).  I just throw a can of chickpeas, juice from a lemon, salt, a handful of fresh cilantro, and varied roasted peppers & garlic in to the blender, until it's all mashed up good.  Delicious combination.<br /><br />I wish these were available on subscribe and save, since we would, in a heartbeat.

review/text: I tried this brand after having a successful experience with the 'Simple 7' brand and they didn't measure up. The baked chips are bland and they are coated in a film that changes their texture. They are to thick and just do not satisfy chip-craving. As the calorie in take is identical to that of the 'Simple 7' brand I'll stick with the latter, which is amazing.

review/summary: The Ice Cream of the Gatorade Line
review/text: This is one of the most fantastic beverages I have had the pleasure of tasting. The taste is revolutationary when you compare it to the other flavors. In fact, I consider Gatorade Cool Blue to be the ice cream of the product line. Orange, Red, and Yellow simply cannot compete with the Blue flavor.<br /><br />Don't assume from me calling it the ice cream of Gatorade that it isn't as healthy, because that is simply not the case. Gatorade Cool Blue has the same nutrition statistics but it comes with double the taste.<br /><br />As far as price, Amazon's asking price of $35.88 for 12 is high. This is an item that would be far more inexpensive buying it from a Sam's Club or a Costco.

It would also be cool if Splenda came up with something like this that was a sweetener+creamer.<br /><br />Looking forward to trying this in French Vanilla.

The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GW68ZI">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Flavor for Coffee, Mocha, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> is my favorite, followed by the Hazelnut and then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GW257S">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Flavor Blends for Coffee, French Vanilla, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. This is only a sweetener so I still use a splash of "Half and Half" along with two of these in my morning cup. These have no calories and less than 1 Net Carb each, so it isn't bad for me to have more than one cup in the morning.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Nothing but the best for the Troops!
review/text: My mom first sent my husband a box in his care package - he is stationed North of Baghdad, Iraq - and it was the best thing he had ever received.  Being in the Army for 24 years, he has had his share of bad coffee, but he doesn't have to have wake up to that anymore.  I sent him another six boxes of the Hazelnut, Mocha, and French Vanilla.  He says the Hazelnut is his, but he shares the rest.  It is a big hit with his unit and all have commented on the AWESOME taste and that the Army coffee is significantly improved!  We won't allow him to run out a box or two are added to every care package my mom and I send.  Nothing but the best for the Troops!

review/summary: Flavor Blends Versatility
review/text: I was disappointed with the product because it seemed to have an "after taste" which Splenda never does to me,.<br /><br /> The hazelnut needs to be more robust to balance things out.<br /><br />I will use the flavor blends in my puddings and baking as well.<br /><br />I truly wish Splenda would work on a "brown sugar" (w/o real sugar) product like Sugar Twin sells.

review/summary: Mocha is best
review/text: This is a pretty good Splenda flavor, but the Mocha is best, in my opinion.  The French Vanilla is a second favorite.  Hazelnut is better than no flavor at all.  I use one flavored packet and one regular Splenda packet in a large (14 oz) mug, and it's perfect.  Not necessary to use two flavored ones, as it is a little pricey and one has enough flavor for an entire travel mug.

review/summary: This is fantastic
review/text: I am on a great program that does not allow dairy products, giving up cream in my coffee was a drastic thing for me.  I love my morning coffee, so when I tried this new Splenda product with Hazelnut I feel back in love with my morning coffee.  The only difference between this and the creamer is that the coffee stays black.  You get the same creamy taste with the nutty flavor of Hazelnut. I am very pleased with this product and plan to order it before I run out.

review/summary: Perfect smell, great taste
review/text: I was using 3 sugar packages for 16 oz of coffee. One Splenda tube is almost as sweet as 3 sugar packages (3 spoons of sugar) and saves me from unnecessary sugar consumption. Hazelnut flavor smells amazing. Taste is great too but it also depends on the coffee used. In my experience, it goes best with Nescafe, other instant coffee brands did not make such an amazing taste with this item. And for some reason, no Splenda product goes well with brewed coffee.

review/summary: Flavorful & delicious, without the extra calories or cost!
review/text: I've been waiting for years for something like this to come along! Hazelnut coffee is my favorite, but it's so much work to find a nice hazelnut-flavored bean, so I'd always just add flavoring to my coffee. The only problem is that the creamers (liquid and powdered) have so many calories! Sure, there's the sugar-free Torani syrup, but it takes a lot to get an intense enough flavor, and it's $16 a bottle! No thank you! I just use 2 packets of the Splenda flavoring per cup, and it makes the best flavored coffee I could imagine! The flavor is intense and delicious, and the product is quite reasonably priced. Since a good review must have pros and cons, the only thing I don't like about this product is the plastic wrappers, which never seem to open very nicely (but all in all, that's a pretty mild fall-back). This is a wonderful product!!!

We normally drink plain black coffee and only occasionally add a small amount of Splenda But with these little tubes of Splenda and flavor, we now use them all the time.  Not too Sweet and just enough flavor. Very hard to find in stores around where we live (Fairfield County, CT) but this is a great price and convenient to buy on amazon!

review/summary: At least it's quick
review/text: I am not sure if I'd actually want to describe it as  'bitter', but I decided to purchase this product because I make coffee using milk. But then if I want a sugared cup, I would still usually have to add sugar and flavoring. So I principally bought this product just to forgo steps in the process.<br /><br />And the packets also seemed to provide convienience for me.<br /><br />But, I would like a stronger hazelnut flavor. Right now, it seems to be very sugary, so people drinking this product might not always detect if they are using flavoring at all. And this actually negates the point of producing the specific product. It would be better to just buy a can of regular sugar plus a bottle of syrup.<br /><br />Still, the product is edible and affordable in the markets where it is for sale. I am able to successfully drink the cups which I've made. And the individual serviving sizes are convienient. So it's not the worst thing which is produced on the market. It's just not the premiere accessory for coffee consumption.

review/text: Delightfully surprised!  Got the sampler pack and was least intrigued by the hazelnut, because though I love Ferrero Rocher and Nutella and the filberts, coffee flavoring in the past has fallen quite short.  O -- M -- G !!!!!  This is SOOO good.  Tastes just like a Ferrero Rocher candy -- and NO CALORIES!!!  I drink my morning coffee black brewed at home, and like to keep the Splenda packets around in case I go for an extra cup of the work brewed rock gut.  So convenient to carry packets in my purse also, if brews are not so tasty when traveling.  My least desired of the 5 pack has now become my favorite.

review/text: The item gets two stars simply because I figure my problem with it might just be a fluke.  I love the mocha flavor item, so tried this.  After one sip I poured the coffee down the sink because it tasted so awful - bitter and strongly chemical.  Maybe there is something wrong with the batch I got?...  At any rate, I'll just stick with the hazelnut creamer and Green Mountain Hazelnut bold k-cups for the flavor I love.  So disappointed.

review/text: I don't like plain coffee but even more, I don't need or like all the calories and fat that come with using flavored coffee creamers. Even the sugar-free creamers have a ton of fat, part of which is hydrogenated/partially hydrogenated.<br /><br />Flavor Blends for coffee are a wonderful alternative to fatty creamers. Easy to use and they come in portable small packages you can take with you anywhere. This is not a creamer but more a flavored "sugar". One packet gives a yummy, subtle hazelnut flavor but without being too sweet the way some things with Splenda are.

review/text: I love this stuff and was elated to find it offered through Amazon for a reasonable price. I ordered the 6-box quantity and received it in a reasonable time.<br /><br />However, of the six boxes I received, five of them had packets that had holes in them or ripped seams.  I discovered this on a business trip when I unzipped my suitcase and found that a few packets had shaken their contents out into my clothes. (There's nothing like having a fine white powder floating around your suitcase when going through Security at the airport.)<br /><br />When I got home, I opened the other 5 boxes and shook each individual packet to make sure no others had holes in them.  Unfortunately, every box had some defective packets.<br /><br />Hey, Splenda/McNeil Nutritionals -- the lot number on all the boxes is the same:  0311N16/073012.<br /><br />Although I like these hazelnut flavor sticks, I'll try and find another source for them.

It is much too overpowering, strong and when added to your beverage, that is all you can taste.  For instance, if added to coffee, you will not detect ANY coffee flavor, only the Splenda flavor.  Much too strong.  I prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this Splenda product - without question!!

review/summary: Goes beyond just for salads
review/text: We have been using the McCormick Perfect Pinch Salad Supreme Seasoning for a few months now.  It has become our go-to seasoning for many things including popcorn!  The small 2.62 oz. shaker from our local store can go as high as $4.00 a container.  Buying this larger size is a little bit cheaper and the convenience of just having it around is cost savings enough.  I would like to bring to everyone's attention you will get this larger container with a white label covering the bar code.  What is also covered is the storage instruction of "Refrigerate after opening to prolong freshness."<br />In addition to sprinkling it on popcorn, fresh and raw vegetable salads, pasta salads, we also use it mixed in the flour coating for sauted chicken breasts.  We are still experimenting. The first ingredient is Romano cheese cured with salt.  The next ingredient is salt.  Obviously, if you are on a salt restricted diet this may not be for you.  If you can eat salt, I would suggest moderation.<br />Remember, put into the refrigertor once you open the container and shake before using.

review/summary: A citrus treat!
review/text: I was very excited to try the Lime Matcha.  I opened this matcha and put it into a tin to keep it fresh.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.  I didn't have any doubts that this matcha would be tasty.  Lime flavored things are so popular nowadays...lime popcorn...lime and sea salt chips....etc.<br />I decided to first prepare this matcha cold with just water.  I added 1 tsp to a 16.9oz bottle and shook it up.  I then put it into the freezer as I really wanted it cold.  If I had let it stay in there overnight I could have had lime matcha popsicles!  I didn't think about that till after I drank it so I'll have to try that next time.  The lime added just enough tartness to give a kick to otherwise boring water.  This matcha intrigued me so much that I decided to prepare it again.  This time I used a bit of seltzer (bubbly) water.  I think I like it even better this way!  I did add a touch of sugar to both preparations.<br />Red Leaf just keeps on amazing me with their creative flavors and the lime flavored matcha does not disappoint!<br /> To get your own tasty Lime Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]

review/summary: Lime + Matcha = Different But Good
review/text: I ordered this Lime Matcha primarily for the mixing capabilities it offered.  I have quite a few Matcha flavors on hand, and I thought that the Lime flavored Matcha might add an interesting dimension of flavor ... of particular interest is a blend with the Watermelon.  It sounds refreshing, no?<br /><br />On it's own, though, it's really quite delicious too.  The aroma is very much like a lime tree.  I smell the bright, citrus-y notes of the lime, and even a hint of the lime blossom.  I smell the leaves and the earth and the tree itself.<br /><br />The sweet, tart, and slightly bitter taste of the lime offers a unique perspective into the Matcha - allowing me to explore the earthier qualities of Matcha in a way that I've never quite experienced them before.  It's a wonderful and very tasty Matcha!

review/summary: Great rawhide!
review/text: My dog LOVES to chew- she's 6 months old and is about 30lbs.  She can get through a rawhide pretty quickly- this one has lasted the longest and is perfect!  Since it takes longer for her to chew it up/eat it, her tummy doesn't get upset like it does with other rawhides that don't last very long.  I highly recommend this to anyone whose dog loves rawhide!

review/summary: Excellent choice
review/text: Thanks to all of the Amazoners who wrote reviews! I ordered this last week for my border collie. He is not that big of a dog, but a big chewer. He used to chew on everything, outdoor furniture, plants, wood, rocks out of our pond. And anything I bought for him didn't last. He is still chewing on this big ring after a week, and has only taken about a 3 inch piece out of it. At this rate, it should last a couple of more weeks.<br /><br />Last night he even got up in the middle of the night and wanted to go outside and chew on his ring. Very good value.

review/summary: Excellent Rawhide Chew for Chewers
review/text: My pit mix absolutely loves the chunky chew braided ring. She has been working on it off long enough to warrant its higher cost than traditional chews. She will go through normal rawhide chews easily within a day. These take her up to a week of real work to get through. The braided design helps in keeping the rawhide difficult to pull apart. Definitely on my short list of chew accessories.

review/text: wow! these guys are huge! got them for our two little dogs who are 10 and 14 lbs.  needless to say, they were not interested in the whole thing..just too big. so i took out a saw and cut them into threes...each piece lasted like a week!  maybe a little longer in some cases...they just chewed them forever!  some of the smaller stuff was gone in a day and we got tired of that...these things last a long time and they seem to like them both..the flavored and the natural.  they weigh like a pound or two a peice...crazy.

review/summary: The Husky Loves It!
review/text: My husband and I have had a hard time finding good distracters for our husky puppy (~1 year old this month). This definitely kept him entertained for a long period of time. It lasted much longer than other raw hide we had given him. I can't give a specific time frame, because we'd let him chew on it for 15-45 minutes and then take it away. He never got bored with it and was always happy to see it come out of his box! I'd say we gave it to him off and on for about a month.  My husband was impressed with how well it was wrapped and how it was made in a way that it was hard for him to bite off big chunks and swallow whole (one of the dangers of raw hide). Overall, I'll definitely be ordering more. We are on #3 of these! I think the first two were this "natural" one, and the other was the one with the added glucosame; I'm sure he doesn't need it yet, as a puppy, but from the sources I found, it can't hurt.

review/summary: Not very impressed
review/text: I was really excited after finding out they were making a iced coffee with cream but the taste is not that good.  I think it has something to do with the creamer they use because I only use real cream/whole milk and have never tasted something so bad.  The other iced coffee flavors are good and do balance out better with ice compared to normal K cups but I'll probably only buy the unflavored iced coffee in the future.  Green Mountain is the first company to come out with this so maybe it will get better if others try at it.  For now I'm sticking to black coffee and adding my own cream and sugar when I want to.

review/summary: An Exotic Black Tea
review/text: Black Dragon Pearl Tea tastes even better than I had expected. It is a smooth black/red tea that is strong without being bitter. There is a definite cocoa component, yet it subtly compliments the Yunnan tea flavor rather than overpowering it. There is also a sweet, earthy quality, but nothing near what one might find in a Pu-Erh tea. The pearls are good about five infusions, with the flavor starting to taper off in the fourth. The dry leaves have an aroma reminiscent of honey and 2-3 pearls per cup is a good place to start. If you have a glass teapot, you can enjoy watching the gold and brown marble-sized leaf balls unfurl in the hot water. The brewing tea has an almost malty aroma. To begin with, brew for about 4 minutes with near boiling water and adjust from there.<br /><br />Black Dragon Pearls is a relaxing, comforting tea that I'll be keeping in regular rotation. My suggestion is that you purchase yours from Adagio Teas rather than Teavana; you get more ounces for your hard-earned dollar and shipping is less expensive as well.

As with all things in life you get what you pay for. And with this tea you know you got your moneys worth. Also of note was the shipping. It shipped out super fast I believe the same day, and came UPS. But I was never given a tracking #. I'm sure you can just email them for one if you like. The packaging was also 1st class, with a free sample of another tea and a very nice catalog. Over all I could not be happier about ordering this tea, and will buy more as soon as I run out.

review/text: I don't like this product at all.I have been growing fava beans for my own home use consumption for more than 20 years.Unfortunately this year's crop was not as<br />good as I had hoped for and I was looking to buy some additional beans.<br />Looking at the offering of Amazon for the Westbrae beans I thought that this was<br />just what I needed but what a disappointment. After opening a can, at 1st glance<br />inside I knew these are very old beans. How could I tell? The big black stripe<br />on the top of the beans mean they were grown to maturity and probably dried before<br />canning, making them very tough. The taste:horrible.The product in my opinion isn't worth more than a couple of nickels per can.<br />Well,live and learn.<br /><br />Jan Van.
