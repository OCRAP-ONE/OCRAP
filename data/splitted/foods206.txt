review/summary: Reduced to a chokable in 10 minutes
review/text: I got these for a 3 month old 4 lb Havanese puppy because her breeder had given us one (I thought) that has lasted a couple of weeks.  I just gave her the puppy chew and I was shocked when she had a 1 inch piece in her mouth--which I quickly took away as a choking hazard--in less than 10 minutes.  I now believe what the breeder had given me was something else that looks just like these puppy chews.  Maybe it was an edible dog chew.  This chew is not long-lasting by any stretch of the imagination!  I should add that my puppy really enjoyed it for the 10 minutes.

review/summary: My Dog loves them, me not so much
review/text: So I read another review before I bought these and saw that it turned things orange but was easy to get out.....not so for my light gray wool area rug.  I have used several carpet cleaners and there is still a slight stain on the rug---much smaller than what I started with, but it won't come out.  However, my German Shepherd puppy loved these things and eat them right up--however I won't be buying them again.

review/text: My wife and I both enjoy flavored coffees.  This one is right at the top of the list!  It smells great and tastes even better.  To make it last longer, we do half and half; we put half regular coffee in the basket and half this strawberry coffee in with it.  We are ready to try the chocolate covered strawberry coffee next.  Outstanding cofee and a great deal, 2 bags for the price.

review/summary: Amazing Coffee!
review/text: My husband and I were served this coffee at Derby Dinner Playhouse.  We asked the wait staff what brand they were serving and they said it was Douwe Egbert.  I had never heard of that brand, and couldn't find it in any of our local shops.  Thankfully for Amazon, we were able to find to purchase for home use.  This coffee is so good!  It's the smoothest coffee I have ever had, and the aroma is heavenly!!!!!!!  I store it in the fridge, and everytime I open the door, I can smell this fabulous coffee.  You won't be sorry on this one!  Try it!

review/text: Douwe Egberts coffee is the most incredible coffee you will ever have, but only out of the machine that uses the liquid form. I was so excited about availability of ground but very dissapointed in the taste. It's ok but nothing like the machine. It doesn't change my opinion of the company and the amazing machine, but I'll just stick with Starbucks, Peet's, Seattle's, etc ground. As always though, Amazon is so easy to work with, I received my order quickly. Amazon never let's me down.

review/text: I'm kind of disappointed in this coffee. Touted to be so wonderfu.  Not all it's cracked up to be. First off the grind is too fine. Second, very hot water makes it bitter. Won't order it again. I wish I had been able to order just one box just to try it first, instead of having to order a set of three. I was looking to find the taste of the coffee in the restaurant.<br />They should sell the liquid like they use in restaurants. What a tease.

review/summary: Good, but I like Jacobs Kronung as much for LESS money
review/text: I've purchased several Douwe Egberts coffees before and thought I would try this one.  For the money it's no replacement for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVIRCU">Jacobs Kronung Coffee, 8.81-Ounce Vacuum Packs (Pack of 4)</a> or the larger 500g packs.  [NOTE:  watch for price changes; my last order of 17.6 oz bags shipped for $13.12 with Subscribe & save but now it's selling for $23.54---???????----so I skipped the upcoming order and hope the price drops back down.]  This DE Select Aroma was okay, but not worth the extra cost, and the Jacobs has a bit more body to the flavor.

I just wish I could buy the beans instead of ground coffee so that I may adjust the grind to my tastes. But holy wow! It is incredibly smooth with just a hint of sweetness at the end. A perfect dessert coffee, or just a lazy sunday coffee. If you love coffee, this will make your day. I swear.

review/text: I recently tried the Gnu Fiber bars in Banana and Walnut for the first time.<br />I have some dental troubles, so I am always concerned as to whether or not I<br />can even chew some of these fiber bars. Some are so hard, I can't bite them at all.<br />Others are expensive, and taste like cardboard.<br /><br />These bars are very tasty!  They are soft enough that they are enjoyable to eat.<br />There is one little seed in the bars that I have a hard time with - guessing it is<br />the millet. Other than that - they are easy for me to eat too.<br /><br />I didn't have troubles with them crumbling like another reviewer said. Mine were<br />very fresh and tasty.<br /><br />I am going to be buying these from here on out, and plan on trying some other flavors<br />as well.  I wish the cost was a little better, but watch for sales - they are out there<br />from time to time. If you like banana walnut flavored items, then you'll like this bar.<br />It tastes almost like a banana walnut muffin. Well worth trying.

review/summary: A Good Product, But Rather Bland.
review/text: My wife lived in London for three years and developed a variety of British tastes. One such item was for rice pudding or creamed rice. Not too long ago I spotted Ambrosia Creamed rice (in 15-ounce cans) on the shelves of my local Fresh and Easy Store (a British company). Well, I just had to try it.<br /><br />Creamed rice is not bad. It's rather bland for my tastes and perhaps it's meant to go with certain types of food.. It's low in fat and sodium and not particularly high in calories, so I don't feel guilty at all.I prefer it chilled. It's smooth and creamy and I'd judge it to be a good product. But, it might take me a while to develop a taste for it. Right for the moment, I find it overly bland.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: I fell in love in Paris
review/text: Yes, with this juice. Apparently I'm not the only person who loves this drink, it is the leading orange carbonated soft drink in France. What I love most about this drink is the not-too-sweet flavor of the carbonated juice. This is not like the super sweet orange drinks that are normally carbonated. It is more like carbonated water with a splash of real orange juice and flavor.<br /><br />I think I first tasted this juice in a caf&eacute; next to the Moulin Rouge in Paris. At least, that is what I remember when we ate lunch after stepping off the tour bus. Anyway, imagine my surprise when I found it was also being sold over here in local tea shops and grocery stores. And now it is here at our very own Amazon!<br /><br />A deliciously light taste and not overly sweet. Perfect for picnics and parties.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Orangina! My Favorite Little Juice Friend!
review/text: Nothing is as comforting and as fun as the orangina bottle. The photo does not do it justice at all. It is almost spherical and fairly stubby. Although it says "citrus" it is sooo orangee that well, you don't taste much else. The other citrus flavors are only in the form of subtle hints. Drinking orangina is almost like having aromatherapy. It is an adult and child pleaser, too. This is the beverage that allowed our children to "have a soda" without having a soda. We are a no pop household. It is also wonderful poured into a more sophisticated goblet, the flavor is alluring and can almost be called pretentious when properly served in place of a dessert liquor or wine spritzer. A lot of us adult Earth pod dwellers don't drink alcohol but want the joy of sipping and savoring. Great beverage. A treat like Polinarious. Enjoy. oh, and the pulp, hardly!

review/text: Orangina is a European drink, made with real orange juice and carbonated water. You can see and taste the pulp in it; it tastes like a spritzer, very refreshing and not overly sweet and artificial like an orange soda. It is really delicious as a cold drink! It used to be that you could only find it a finer foods market or deli, but it is getting easier to find now.  Also the price has come down recently since they found an American bottler to manufacture and sell it in the states under license to the French. Also the glass bottle has a very cool shape, and feels good in your hand.

review/text: Like another reviewer, I too fell in love with the beverage while in France.  I was overjoyed when, a few months after my return a found that it was available in an expensive grocery store near me.  Unfortunately, the kind of Orangina sold in the US is not the same beverage that is available in Europe.  The ingredients are totally different.  Since this product page says "Made in the US", I can only assume this is the American recipe, which is not as tasty (but probably has a longer shelf life).  Just thought I'd give a heads up to anyone who was expecting the European version!<br />I miss my Orangina

I remembered back in '95, Orangina bottles sold from Terner's Liquor had the exact shape and size like Clearly Canadians'(16oz?), after a while I couldn't find it anymore. I searched everywhere, including places like BevMo, zilch! All of a sudden it emerged out of nowhere in the form of slightly smaller "bulby" bottles. There is just something about this beverage, that I'll never forget the taste of it, the lightly carbonated juice stings your tongue and not too sweet. It was and still very unique and refreshing. I have not been able to locate this drink for about 10 years and was lingering in my mind from time to time every time when I passed by the L.A. area.....until now, thanks to Trader Joe's I stock 'em up chilled!

review/summary: Like Something You might find for sale at a four year olds juice stand
review/text: I, too, first tasted this at a "caf&eacute; next to the Moulin Rouge in Paris" it was about 90 degrees and reminded me of water from a hose washing over an old orange in the middle of the Sahara on a rather off day. In fact I venture to guess that's how its made with the bubbles that are there by some process of heat related fermentation.<br /><br />My experience in 1976 after ordering was regretting the 4 bucks just spent getting it, but I defend myself by saying I was so thirsty and hoping for a cold drink. Ha ha. I was later to realize that o get that kind of experience you had a better shot by freezing bottles of water in the US, putting in dry ice and hoping for a positive customs experience. That was a far, far better way to obtain a cool drink. At least in Vienne France if gave the nice inn keeper a twenty I got free use of a tiny fridge, which he found remarkably strange to use for my juice, colas or water. But that's off topic.<br /><br />Here's what you get for the almost four dollars per bottle, a weak watered slightly sweet beverage with a cross of what I hold is a mandarin and orange pulp, minor amount of pulp, some rather dingy looking stuff that's settled in the bottom that's grainy and a lot of off carbonated water. It's what my husband calls (poor word) water, but he likes them. For him they fill a sentimental niche. For me they say....France was very expensive.<br /><br />But I adored much about the travel and the country. I do like the bottles. I save them, peel off the labels and use them for rosemary in oil and other kinds of herbed oils I like to make. So if he'll drink it up, or I can pawn it off on some unaware visitor then I've got a nice bottle to use making bath oils. Great for lavendar scented bath potions.<br /><br />If you love it, give up on me in this regard. This is not a Sam-I -Am-Moment for the two of us. I would not, could not on one foot, in a bar, by a car, I will not, should not in cathedral, for a beagle or by that icosahedral. I can not drink it, Sam You Are, I do not like this watered juice in jar.

This allowed me to give this product about ten chances with different cooking and rinsing techniques,  various sauces and attempts at patience. It's awful. The rest of the boxes will go to the food bank because obviously some consumers like it. I will stick with Schar and a few other faves that get the consistency and flavor right... and just forego the angel hair.

review/text: We love pasta and it was my daughter in law who introduced me to this product, as I love pasta.  This is not heavy, like most pasta.  It is similar to angel hair pasta but more delicate and much more palatable and flavorful.  Perfect for pesto, light marinara or lightly buttered with shrimp (your favorite chicken or fish) vegetables and yet more healthy and satisfying.  It costs a bit more, but well worth it, for those who want to eat more light yet hearty.  My family love it!

review/summary: Great Angel Hair option for GF pasta
review/text: We were happy to find an "angel hair" version of GF pasta as my husband prefers this style to "spaghetti".  Although a box of this is comparable in price to a box of spaghetti, I do find I need to make more - our family of 4 will finish off close to 2 boxes in one meal.  The texture and taste are great (I also enjoy Tinkyada Rice pasta and Mrs. Leepers corn pasta).  The only other downside is that this pasta really seems to stick to itself once it cools off a bit.  It gets difficult to scoop it out of the dish during dinner as it has become one giant ball of pasta.  (We can't add the sauce to the pasta in the serving dish since not everyone in the family can have all the other ingredients - we are dealing with more than just GF.  Adding sauce may solve this problem for others.)

review/text: Jablum Jamaican coffee is Jamaica itself, especially the Sandals Resort at Ocho Rios. If you ever make it to Jamaica, be sure to buy plenty of Jablum in the airport's Duty Free stores . . . it is far less expensive, but not necessarily fresher. Also, make sure that the bean quality is #1 (not a problem with Jarblum products, but a concern with other Jamaican "blends" offered in stores and on the Internet). Thank heaven for the Blue Mountains (the "blum" in Jablum)!

review/summary: Straight from Jamaica
review/text: I was not expecting this coffee to actually be shipped from Jamaica, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a FedEx International package at my door.  One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other "Jamaica grown" products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price.

To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it.

I can only figure the seller received the coffee as a gift and had no idea the cost.  I LOVE coffee and figured this would be very good but was so disappointed.  I wanted to see how much it would have cost me had I not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when I saw the going price on Amazon!!!!!!  There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.  I too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places, but not at this price... Needless to say unless I find another at a yard sale, I'll never drink this coffee again once my 16 ounces is gone... except if I take a trip to Jamaica mon.  :-)

review/text: I purchased this coffee to replace my Lavazza because Lavazza quality has been inconsistent.  Upon opening, I noticed no date on the package... concerning.  I tuned my Vario grinder to ensure the correct grind for this new bean.  I pulled a shot of espresso (I have an Andreja Premium from QuickMill)... Horrible.  I adjusted the grind three more times with as many shots.  The shots were consistently watery, bitter, and, quite frankly, embarrassing.  DO NOT purchase this product.  I will use these beans to pull throw-away shots after cleaning my grinder and espresso machine... that's all they are good for.

review/summary: Great alternative to cane sugar.
review/text: I wasn't totally sure what to expect when I received my coconut sugar.  What I did receive was two bags of sugar, one labeled "blonde".  Both sugars were caramel in color with the blonde being a little lighter.  The smell and taste was very similar to brown sugar, however the texture was dryer.  The granules were not a consistent size as with cane sugar.  No "coconut" taste whatsoever.<br /><br />I wanted to bake with this sugar to see if it was interchangeable with cane sugar.  Coconut sugar is supposed to be less calories and have a lower glycemic level compared to cane sugar.  As I understand glycemic levels, the lower the level, the easier it is for your body to metabolize, thus not creating that "sugar crash".<br /><br />To compare to cane sugar, I used a 1:1 ratio as suggested by the company.  I ate it raw on cinnamon toast (blonde), and made pancakes (blonde) and Toll House cookies with it (both blonde and regular).  For the most part I found it to be completely interchangeable with cane sugar in recipes.  I noticed that the granules left "freckles" of sugar and didn't completely blend in, however, texture and taste was very close to cane sugar.  If health reasons have you making the switch, this is a great option!

review/summary: Best Sugar Substitute I Have Found
review/text: I use coconut sugar in everything that I used to make with cane sugar:  cookies, muffins, chocolate syrup, fruit crisps, cakes, etc.  A handful of helpful tips:  (1) It can be made into a fine powdery consistency by blending it in a Vitamix, food processor, or even a good coffee bean grinder.  (2) This enables one to make powdered sugar (just add 1 TB arrowroot powder or tapioca starch per 1 cup finely blended coconut sugar).  Then coconut sugar can be used to make icing and the like.  (3) Sweetened condensed milk can also be made. (See allrecipes.com's recipe for regular sweetened condensed milk.  Ingredients are: 1 1/8 powdered milk, 1/2 cup water, 3/4 cup coconut sugar, blended to a fine consistency.)  It isn't all that pretty (beige color) but it makes wonderful lemon bars.<br /><br />Coconut sugar doesn't taste exactly like cane sugar (more maple-y and hearty), but there is no sugar crash since it has a low glycemic index of 35 (lower than apples and carrots).  It is loaded with potassium, along with nitrogen, zinc, magnesium and several vitamin Bs (as opposed to agave syrup, which is fairly empty of any nutritional value).<br /><br />Additionally, this price that Amazon offers is less than my co-op's bulk price.

review/text: Just want to note my initial impressions.  I usually use sugar at home only for beverages and cereal.  I was running low on the 'raw sugar' I bought a few months back, and was looking for some more, when I ran into this.  For the price, it was worth a try.<br /><br />When I opened the package and caught the first sniff of the product, the first thought that came into my head was 'grape nuts'.  Odd, but that's what it made me think of.  The flavor is acceptable, no coconut that I could discern.  I agree that it doesn't seem quite as sweet as regular sugar.  It dissolves well in my coffee, but I haven't tried it on cereal yet.  I like the fact that it provides some nutritional value as well as sweetness.<br /><br />So, my 5 rating is qualified only by the fact that it is less sweet than I am used to.  I'm going to try using the same amount as I would if I were using 'regular' sugar and see if it's something I can get used to.  I could stand to become a little less dependent on sweetness.

review/summary: Most nutritious and best performing alternative sugar
review/text: I have been using Madhava coconut sugar for 6 months now, and have used it extensively in nearly every application where cane sugar is normally used.  Previously, I have used succanat sugar, raw honey, and agave sugars as well as non-sugar sweeteners such as xylitol and stevia.  Of all of the sugars, this compares most favorably to cane sugar in terms of taste and performance.  As a bonus, it has the most vitamins, minerals, and trace nutrients of any sugar available.<br /><br />The texture is very dry and lighter coming out of the bag.  The smell and taste is similar to succanat--as is the performance.  It works very well in any coarser baked goods -- muffins, breads, some cookies, and even brownies.  Like unprocessed cane sugars, it will color your baking brown and leave a bit of a gritty texture, so very fine baked goods will not work.  Also in baking, I sometimes add a tad more liquid to make up for the dryness.  For drinks, it dissolves a little slower than regular sugars.  Finally, it is definitely less sweet than cane sugar cup for cup.  To me, this is not a bad thing--I often reduce the sugar a bit in recipes anyway.<br /><br />Of course, we all need to eat less sugar.  This is a GREAT option for those who want a lower glycemic, more nutritious sugar to use in foods they are going to eat anyway.  Amazon has the best price anywhere on this, and I will keep buying as long as it is available.

review/summary: I like it!
review/text: I'm a sugar lover ... I know as I get older, I can't keep eating so much sugar.  They say this stuff is better for you, so I figured I'd give it a try.  Like other folks say, it's a bit less sweet than regular or even raw sugar ... I just add more to taste (hopefully that's not defeating the purpose!)  It does tend to have some dark specs in it, but I know it's part of the refining process.  I got a great deal on Amazon and I'm very happy with this purchase.  I use it in my coffee every day!  Now, I just need to find a 'healthier' substitute for creamer.

review/summary: Great in Thai recipes or curries, low glycemic though it is sucrose
review/text: Coconut palm sugar and date palm sugar are used in cooking in Southeast Asia. The sweetness is rather like a mild brown sugar or a raw sugar and coconut sugar is not highly processed, whereas cane and beet sugar are highly processed.<br /><br />Coconut sugar consists primarily of sucrose which is chemically the same as cane or beet sugar, but it has a small amount of glucose and fructose. Attention, diabetics, it should be dealt with carefully, though it is said to be lower glycemic, with a glycemic index of 35. It is said to be diabetic-friendly, but I'd be sure to test it out and measure blood sugar levels, to make sure how your system reacts to this sweetener. (I am not diabetic, but I am always chary of any new sweetener that claims to be low glycemic or better for diabetics as each person can have quite different reactions.)<br /><br />In any case, this has more minerals, less processing and tastes great. It's a really great substitute for raw sugar or evaporated cane juice and excellent especially for Asian cooking. I like jaggery sugar (date palm sugar) but as it comes in an unwieldy lump that needs grating, this granulated coconut sugar is a good substitute when making certain chutneys and other curries.

review/summary: be aware of teh blonde
review/text: I am diabetic....so I was looking for a good replacement for standard sugar, Coconut sugar did it for me.<br />Hardly any BG level changes an great taste. Be aware that there are 2 different Madhava Coconut sugars, blonde which is this one and the dark. Both are great, the darker version has a bit more of an "own" taste which is fine in any kind of baked goods and for example coffee, I absolutely did NOT like it in my iced tea. I cant tell you why...its a taste question.<br /><br />Even the blond comes with a bit of a taste, but much less then the dark.<br /><br />Oh..important! The taste I speak about is not Coconut...it doesnt taste one bit like coconut...sweet....bit of a candy taste which is great in baked goods and coffee.... for Iced Tea I use blue agave...fits perfect<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Oh...and dont trust my words my words regarding BG of you are diabetic.....everyone reacts absolutely different.

review/summary: The perfect low-glycemic sweetener for baking!
review/text: I love all things coconut, and was first drawn to coconut sugar when I turned to a paleo lifestyle. I love that it is an organic, low glycemic sweetener. The blonde variety can be used as a sub for either white OR brown sugar. I make everything from pancakes to muffins to cookies with this and recommend it to all of my friends looking to make a healthy, easy swap for refined sugar in their pantry. Added bonus that palm/coconut sugar doesn't clump up as much as traditional refined brown sugar!

review/text: My husband has diabetes and I bought this as an alternative sweetener recommended from the book Diabetes without Meds, by Suzie Cohen.  I love the product and to know that it sweetens without being overbearing like the artificial stuff along with knowing it is all natural and unrefined so we are getting the mineral benefits as well is awesome.  No one knows the difference and my husband's sugar levels do not spike when I use this.  Absolutely get the product and buy the book which is chuck full of info...All available at Amazon.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: This is the dried sap from coconut blossoms.  Looks and tastes like really good home-made brown sugar, but with a lower glycemic index than sugar...favorable with often more expensive blue agave nectar.  This has replaced all sugar in our house and can be used 1:1 like white sugar.  Aside from the low glycemic index, it has some nice minerals and amino acids.<br /><br />This pack of six is often sold at a very good price, competing with supermarket brown sugar which is just white sugar that has had a little molasses added back in.<br /><br />Whether its healthier or better is somewhat irrelevant.  It tastes good, should be better for me, and it doesnt cost an arm and a leg.

review/summary: You will never go back to regular sugar!
review/text: I first tried coconut sugar after Dr. Oz mentioned it as being better for you than regular sugar. Prior to this, I had also tried organic cane sugar but, this is just wonderful and TASTY! It substitutes one-to-one for regular sugar but has this delicious taste to it. You can use it in baking, etc....but I mostly use sugar in my coffee. I had been using Truvia recently but this makes the coffee so must more delicious!!! The only drawback is that it has calories, just like sugar does but....YUM!!!

review/summary: Good sweetener - not too sweet
review/text: I've been using the Madhava organic blonde sugar now for about 2 weeks.  I don't use a lot of sugar on a daily basis but I have used it in my coffee and tea instead of my usual agave syrup and used it on some hot cereal.  I found that I needed to use a bit more of the coconut sugar to get the drink/food up to the sweetness level I like, but all in all it tastes fine.  I don't know what the glycemic index is of the coconut sugars but that data would definitely determine whether I continued to use it more regularly (since I seem to need to use more).  I tried the darker coconut sugar too and will review that on the relevant page.)

review/text: One the plus side, I seem to use a lot less of this than I do regular sugar in my coffee. On the down side, I'm not really happy with the taste. It's not bad, just a little strange. Not at all like coconuts - I like coconut flavored coffee and coconut oil (I even like coconut oil in my coffee a la "Bulletproof Coffee"). I've also found hard particulate matter, just a little bit, in the bottom of my coffee mug. Something I don't see when using regular sugar.<br /><br />I'm not at all disappointed in my purchase, and I plan on using it all. But I'm not sure I'd buy it again. Truly a YMMV situation.

review/text: After years of using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FL08AG">Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Turbinado Raw Cane Sugar, 24-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> I decided to mix it up a bit and try something new.  I believe I made a mistake.  I didn't care for it when tasting straight out of the bag.  It's like a poor man's brown sugar, only costing more.  Next, I tried it in some tea and my dislike was confirmed.  The taste is tepid and to me it does not come close to sweetening using a 1:1 ratio to regular or turbinado sugar.  Maybe it will grow on me, and if it does I will be sure to update my review.  However, I do not see that happening.

review/summary: Not as sweet, but more flavor!
review/text: I originally came across this item because I LOVE coconut flavor, however I quickly realized that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HGOIQ4">Madhava Organic Blonde Coconut Sugar</a> doesn't actually TASTE like coconut. It does, however, have more flavor than regular cane sugar with a hint of caramel.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HGOIQ4">Madhava Organic Blonde Coconut Sugar</a> is excellent in coffee or tea and can be used in recipes, however the results will differ slightly from those made with white sugar. Coconut sugar is more mild so deserts may come out a bit mellow (less sweet) and processed white sugar may be preferable where a white/light color is desired. Just this evening we made tapioca pudding and, while I'm quite pleased with the results, it's definitely different than mom used to make.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that the (6) 16-Ounce packages mean you can buy in bulk without having to open a large quantity at once.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Low glycemic index (35)<br />- Safe for diabetics<br />- Rich "caramel" flavor<br />- Not highly processed<br />- Possible source of potassium, magnesium, zinc, iron, vitamin B1, B2, B3, and B6<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Sweetness may vary and be less strong<br />- May result in different appearance than traditional white sugar<br /><br />Overall, I give <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HGOIQ4">Madhava Organic Blonde Coconut Sugar</a> five stars as it's an excellent product for a great price.

review/summary: great sugar substitute
review/text: Bought this brand because it was featured on Dr. Oz (like the fact that it has a lower gylcemic level). Decided on coconut sugar as it had a 1:1 replacement for regular sugar, and I use sugar primarily for baking, so this was important to me.  Have found that it's virtually indistinguishable from regular sugar. I haven't noticed a difference in taste. This coconut sugar also reacts similarly to regularly sugar in baking, so my cakes, brownies, cookies, etc. have all been fine, and I don't feel like I'm sacrificing quality. The sugar is more granular in nature, i.e. larger crystals than regular or brown sugar- sort of reminds me of the fake brown sugar. It doesn't come in a resealable bag, so I end up putting it in a container. I bought it using subscribe and save, and that's the cheapest price that I've seen. I will definitely buy it again.

review/text: I love this sugar.  It is the only sweetener that I use now.  I bought my first case a few months ago and am getting ready to order the 2nd one.  For me... a little goes a long way as I don't care for anything overly sweet.  I use the same amount of this product that I used with the organic sugar I've now replaced.  For Lucy who is wondering whether this is 100% organic coconut sugar, the ingredient list states: organic granulated coconut nectar (it is made from the flower buds of the coconut tree).  It is very yummy!  I have even introduced others to it who like it so much they are now "converts".

review/summary: Don't know what's going on...
review/text: My parents are both diabetics (Type 1 and Type 2). Their blood sugar has been uncontrollable and was looking for a healthy alternative to Splenda.  Bought this last week at Whole Foods in Northbrook and it was on sale as well.<br /><br />Love the smell, but when they put it to their coffee, their blood sugar spiked 5 times the normal range.  At one point, my mom's sugar spiked to it's highest ever at 389.  She was so scared when she saw "CHECK FOR KETONES" on the machine.  Well, let's try baking bread and using this coconut sugar instead.  It has that same effect.  I was wondering if we could be doing something wrong.  Maybe we are using a wrong ratio to the table sugar.  My parents used the 1 to 1 ratio (e.g. 1 tsp coconut sugar = 1 tsp cane sugar).<br /><br />I really had high hopes with this product specially for my diabetic parents. I researched high and low here in Amazon and other diabetes blog sites. I have read nothing but excellent reviews of this product and other Organic Coconut Sugar.<br /><br />Please, if we are doing something wrong, let us know.  Give us some feedback.  My parents have stopped taking this and is looking for a different alternative. I read some excellent reviews regarding a product called Xylitol.  So i might try next.

That, coupled with the color in my items, I may not purchase it again until I decide to cut my sugar uptake.  I don't now how it will taste with the recipes on the site as I generally do not bake, but with the simple syrup the color is so pronounced. ;-(<br /><br />I got this off the Gold Box deal and it was a great price, so that is not a disappointment.

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: Booda Bone Dog Treats, 9 Pack
review/text: My dog loves Booda Bones.  They are a bit pricy so I only give him a couple a week as a special treat.  I'll continue buying them from Amazon for the best price.

review/summary: Very Healthy!
review/text: We have a dog with a liver shunt - so she can't have a lot of protein / can't digest protein.  Booda Bones are the BEST treat for her (and our other dog loves them as well!).  The only 'downside' whatsoever is that they're a tad expensive - but they're worth it!

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

review/summary: Dog is not a fan
review/text: My dog loves the chicken, steak, and peanut butter booda bones, but he's not as fond of the spearmint/peppermint variety.  My dog will eat it if offered, but my dad's dog who I often sit for will not even touch these.  I wouldn't recommend for a dog who prefers meat.

review/summary: My dogs have rated Booda Bones 5 Stars!
review/text: I have three King Charles Cavalier Spaniels and they are picky, picky eaters even when it comes to Treats.  They love the peanut flavored Booda Bones and have one every day.  They insisted I write this review on Amazon so their opinions could be known.  They're pushy that way...

review/summary: NOT long lasting
review/text: I was very disappointed by the product.  They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe.  I was going to buy Chewlotta's which take my dog about 2 hrs to go through 1, but I thought it was too pricey at $3 a pop.  My dog could eat this whole bag in less than 2 hours.  He does enjoy them though.

review/summary: Chloe loves them!
review/text: Our Boston Terrier loves these bones - we give them to her as a treat or to keep her busy when we have company.  For a 16 lbs. dog she's a mighty chewer and these last her a couple of hours, with breaks to investigate if she's missing anything!  We'll buy more of these!

review/summary: My dog goes crazy for these!
review/text: My chihuahua loves these, especially the peanut butter, chicken, and bacon varities. They have become increasingly hard to find at pet stores so I was happy to find them on amazon. I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.
