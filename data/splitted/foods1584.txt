review/summary: Less Additives than other Packaged Jerky
review/text: It's tough to rate a food item as everyone has their own tastes. However, I think when it comes to store bought beef jerky, Jack Link's is about as good as they come. Most companies add a ton of extra garbage to their jerky, including sugar. You'll sometimes find 8-10 grams of sugar in some other brands. But with Jack Link's you are getting only 2 grams, and a taste that is comparable. And while all jerky is high in sodium, I realized these are a bit less than most competitors.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is just good beef jerky without all the hoopla. A perfect healthy snack for someone in need of a little extra protein during the day. It won't beat the stuff coming direct from a butcher, but it's better than most of the other one's you'll find at a convenient store.

review/summary: Good but salty!
review/text: It's a nice price for a good jerky.  I try to keep loaded up on protein, and these jerkys are easy to just have lying around in case I feel like having one.  They taste pretty good, they're very low in carbohydrates and fat...<br /><br />But they're too salty.  I don't mean in a "Gee that's more than the Surgeon General recommends" kind of way, but in a disgusting kind of way.  Maybe if you have a really high tolerance for salt it's no problem, but I think most people would agree...anyway I get the Teriyaki flavor, with 440 mg of salt per oz.  The Pepper and the original flavors, at 770 per oz, are just too salty for me to want to eat.<br /><br />Amazon also has like alligator and elk and duck jerkey for sale...think I might give those a try once I run through this box.

review/summary: Thick and chewy, not traditional jerky but delicious nonetheless
review/text: I am in search of a good jerky and just had to try these.  I guess I paid little attention to the label "Beef Steak" versus beef jerky.  These pieces are thick and chewy and very peppery (in the original flavor).  I [personally find that I have more of an affinity to the regular, thinner sliced jerky over these "beef steaks" ... but we bought two boxes and are certainly enjoying them.<br /><br />These 2-ounce packs are filling, packed with protein and provide a great mid-day energy boost.  They travel well and the Jack Links brand has not let us down.  With so many varieties, we will be trying more.  These were a pleasant surprise and were different.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is a thicker cut, 2 oz packs have 1280 mgs of sodium per serving.  Quite a lot!  Also, keep a toothpick or dental floss nearby, you'll need it!<br /><br />Very enjoyable nonetheless.

review/text: I've picked up the smaller size at convenience stores and have always liked them.  I read some of the reviews and one person mentioned how very salty they were, but I bought this pack of 12 anyway.  I thought maybe he was just a little sensitive, but, wow, he was right!  I like the flavor, but cannot eat much of it at once. I eat only a small amount each time and close the package back up.  The small ones I get in the convenience stores don't seem this salty.

review/summary: That's what she said!
review/text: This is big!  It's about a foot long and they has a pretty good girth to it (that's what she said)!  It's not as soft as normal jerky you find in the bag - I think this stuff is made differently.  It's tough and salty (that's what she said).  It's not the best tasting Jerky I've ever had, but for the price it definitely exceeds my expectations.  I've tried the Oberto brand jerky sticks and they were not very good at all.  And with 23g of protein and only 2g of fat in each stick it's pretty good for you!  One stick is pretty much a meal, though.  I find myself working on it for about 30 minutes before I down it all (that's what she said).<br /><br />Goodnight everybody - i'll be in town all week!

review/text: I've tried the hickory and peppered so figured I'd try the cajun too since I like spicy food. It has a nice kick to it but it's not too hot, at least in my opinion. The spicy taste lingers in your mouth for a bit but it's not a hot burn. It's not as tasty as I'd like but overall it's good and I'll order it again. My favorite is the peppered though, great taste and just a little spice from the pepper.

I personally am a body builder and I'm looking to eat as much protien as possible everday. I definatly noticed an upgrade in performance in the gym and during the day when I take this. Although the cajun flavor is a tade too spicy for me at times. Like my eyes will get red and my nose will start to run. Other than that it is delicous. I will probably try the Teriyaki next.

I saw these in stores for at least 50% more and convenience stores.... well, who has a wheelbarrow that big to haul around their change in?<br /><br />Send a lot of Jacks Link's steak strips and jerky to the American GIs in the Sand and found ordering it this way to be much more pliable and easier on your jaw than the same brand in Mart type or warehouse membership stores. If you send any to the heat like that, this is a much better product so there's a little time allowed to still have decent jerky arrive.  Steak strips and jerky are better liked than the nuggets tho..

review/summary: Try it in strip form and from somewhere else
review/text: I usually buy the Sweet&Hot jerky strips at Walmart and love the taste. I decided to try the 2oz stick from Amazon and was disappointed for 3 reasons:<br /><br />1. They came with expiration date only 48 days away. I've bought a couple of grocery items from amazon and this seems to be a common pattern. I've also read reviews complaining about the expiration issue on other Amazon grocery products. I love shopping from Amazon, but this reason alone may stop me from buying perishables from them again.<br /><br />2. These sticks are not nearly as soft in texture as the strips. Maybe it's because it's almost reached its expiration date?<br /><br />3. The flavor is not exactly the same as the strips. It tastes more or less the same as regular beef jerky. A bit of hot (as most jerkies are), but not much sweet. Again, is age a factor?<br /><br />I've tried many brands and flavors, and Jack Link's Sweet&Hot is by far my favorite. Get it in strips.. and get it from you local grocer.

Really, it deserves 3.5 stars, but there's no half-star option available.

review/summary: Great furikake!
review/text: This is the most basic type--sesame seeds, salt, seaweed and sugar (not too much)...tastes just right for sprinkling on rice, and whatever else you want.<br /><br />I bought it for the rice (I missed the little packets we used to get in Japan) but have been having fun sprinkling away on non-traditional things.  Think cream cheese and celery.  This tastes great though I was surprised to see the 'product of China label'.  Oh well, I get what I can from Amazon--now that I'm in Europe instead of Asia.  It's just nice to have the authentic flavor again.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />JTG

review/summary: SUPER YUMMY!!!! Sushi lovers or not : )
review/text: If you like seaweed & sushi you'll love this seasoning. My Japanese friend first introduced me to it and it's a common treat in bento boxes. Kids love it too and my daughter actually sprinkles it on her popcorn, so I have to hide it in the pantry!!! I disagree with the other reviewer, there's no grass like taste to it at all. A pallet that appreciates the delicate taste of nori will love it. It is slightly sweet and slightly salty so it really satisfies the taste buds...it's a very delicate flavor.  Make sure to use *JAPANESE* sticky rice (not sticky sweet), shape in to little balls while hot with damp hands (this is the tricky part for us Americans...try plastic wrap if it sticks to your hands too much) and add the seasoning on top.  ****Super yummy**** and this brand has other tasty flavors. Good stuff, live a little and try it if you haven't yet, you will be back for more.

review/summary: Best Tea in the World!
review/text: As traditional and satisfying as Sunday Lunch.  A life long tea drinker of up to 10 cups daily, I've tried just about every tea I've seen and Yorkshire Red is my all time favorite.  It's full bodied, bracing, refreshing and relaxing all at the same time.  The taste doesn't fade with cream and sugar.  The loose tea brews quickly using very little.  I make it right in my mug with this nice infuser <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D07MCU">Finum Goldton Filters, Blue and Green</a>and it brews almost as quickly as pouring the boiling water over the leaves.  There is a Yorkshire Gold but I always prefer Yorkshire Red.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

review/text: I am very happy to see that Pepsi brought back their Pepsi Throwback after a limited-time offering a couple summers ago.  This formula is far superior to the current formula that uses high-fructose corn syrup.  To me, there seems to be a deeper taste, whereas the high-fructose corn syrup formula seems to me to have a more empty taste in comparison.  In any event, try it for yourself and make up your own mind... you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Brings back memories
review/text: I had some Pepsi Throwback back in January.  It sure brings back memories of when the formula for Pepsi was different than it is now.  This old Pepsi formula contains pure cane sugar instead of the high fructose corn syrup they now use (and have used since the 1980s).  When I saw the old emblem on the can, I thought something was weird until I read the word "Throwback" on it.  It makes me feel like it's 1970-something again.<br /><br />I give this product 4 stars because I've always preferred Coca-Cola to Pepsi.  I give the current regular Pepsi with high fructose corn syrup 3 stars.<br /><br />I recommend this product for anybody who wants to re-live the good old days.

It does taste better than the high fructose corn syrup version. And taste aside, I will never buy a product with high fructose corn syrup again because of the long term health risks.

review/text: When your cursor hovers over the stars as you start your review, three stars says "it's ok"; and four stars says "I like it", so I guess it's 4 stars.<br /><br />But, I'm not sure if I like it well enough to purchase again. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it. I certainly didn't dislike it. BUT I didn't LOVE it (five stars) and right now I'm not really spending money on something unless I NEED it, want it, and LOVE it.<br /><br />If I do purchase it again, however, I will probably buy the bulk bag instead. I enjoyed the convenience of tossing these packets into my purse and take with me, but I found that I needed three packets rather than one to give me the satisfactory cuppa Joe (Dandy) and it didn't seem very economical then. There are definite difference in uses and experiences in using an INSTANT product and a brewed product. If you like a brewed experience, nothing beats Teecino. Both are good but serve their purpose.<br /><br />Again, nothing wrong with it. It tastes very good, easy, convenient, happy to have found it and if you're absolutely looking for a coffee substitute, I think you'll like this INSTANT version.

review/summary: strong black tea, not bitter
review/text: I've been searching for a while for a strong black tea to be my morning pick-me-up.  I do drink coffee, but I enjoy tea a great deal more.  Most of the teas I've tried have good flavor, but they get bitter very fast if I've accidentally steeped the tea too long, which tended to spoil my enjoyment.  I'd expect a smooth drink, and I'd end up making a face in reaction to how bitter the tea would be.  So why don't you just make sure you don't steep it so long, I hear you ask.  Because I'm not a morning person, and I'm not setting a timer for steeping my tea.  That's a level of commitment I'm not prepared to make every day while I'm getting ready for work.  I also drink my tea black, so I don't cover up flavors with sugar and milk.<br /><br />I've tried the Choice Organic English breakfast tea, and, while strong and flavorful, it falls into the bitter-if-oversteeped category.  Given the good flavor of that tea, I crossed my fingers and went ahead with the purchase of this 6-box set.  This tea, the Celtic breakfast tea, isn't bitter.  The flavor is stronger than almost any other tea, as you'd expect from an Irish breakfast style tea.  I also think is the best-tasting tea I've had; better than the expensive loose-leaf stuff you can by from Octavia or other brands.  I was sold after the first cup of Celtic breakfast, and this will be the only tea I'll buy for a while.<br /><br />If you like a strong black cup of tea, stronger than English breakfast tea and with a slightly malty flavor, you'll like this Celtic breakfast tea.

review/summary: "Top of the line tea"
review/text: Over recent years I have revamped my eating habits considerably. Eight years ago I stopped drinking coffee and to this day drink tea instead. I drink three to four cups a day, and only black tea. About two years ago I found out that tea leaves are not washed and therefore any chemicals sprayed on the leaves end up in the tea itself. For that reason, I started drinking only organic tea. Immediately I could taste the difference. After searching around, and trying about eight to ten different types, I have to say that this is the best tasting full bodied tea. I do rotate it with other organic black teas, but this is my primary tea of the day. As is the case some times, I do have to order it on amazon because I can't find it in any stores in my area. A small price for a gooooooood cup of tea. ENJOY!

review/summary: D&A Spice Mill - Garlic At Its Best
review/text: If you're like me, often you just don't have the time or forgot to buy some fresh garlic at the store, and pretty much bottled dry garlic just doesn't cut it - I've tried them all!  BUT.... that's where D&A Garlic comes in - their spices, Garlic, Salt, Pepper and others, are simply the best possible products is an easy to use grinder container. Yes, you can easily find similar products at the store, but NOT similar taste.  Go ahead, try the garlic - heat up some spaghetti in a pot, add butter to coat, and grind on a nice amount of D&A Garlic, stir and let sit for just a minute or two - the fresh and natural flavor, as well as small fresh garlic pieces will astound you (and no tomato needed!) Try adding some fresh garlic to your buttered popcorn, get inventive!  The Med. Salt and the Multi-pepper are equally fantastic on your steaks, eggs or other favorite standard fare - add some spice to your life today.  These are worth the extra price - you pay for what you get! (and if you want quality, taste, and unmatched excellence - this is it. (I even had some old Garlic that was 3 years past its recommended best use date, and it was still wonderful - better than the other junk I had just bought at the store, which is what prompted my to retry this brand from Italy - made in Florence, with care and pride).

review/summary: Tastes Great, But Not So Useful
review/text: I actually purchased this to origanally replace galic powder as that what I typed in when this came up. I figured I use a peppercorn grinder and a seasalt grinder, so why not a garlic grinder. Sadly the grinder on this unit still leaves the dried garlic in large chunks, which means it is essentially putting dried minced garlic on or in your food. With how readiliy available peeled garlic cloves are at the grocery store, mincing fresh garlic is almost as easy, is cheaper, and tastes better than this product. That being said this is the best tasting dry garlic I have ever had, but I cannot recommend buying it.<br /><br />Overall I am giving it four stars, as I think it is the best product at what it is, but the failed logic behind it will prevent it from getting five stars.

It also makes it so easy to control how much garlic you want to use each time. The garlic always tastes fresh when you grind it for each dish, and it doesn't clump up like regular ground garlic always does after having it in the cupboard for awhile. I find it fun to use, also. There is no mess or wasted time. It is a great product.

I found it online, and have been ordering it here since then, now only to find out it is OUT OF STOCK!  I am hoping this is a very temporary situation.  I use this on all my vegetables, and whenever I need a little garlic kick, even sometimes when I have used whole garlic in my recipe.  Sometimes it just needs more garlic.  I have given this away to other people because it is such a handy way to season with garlic.  I use a lot of fresh garlic too, but for my veggies or a quick garlic infusion, this is the ticket!

We now order it by the case because we use it so much and it makes great gifts for friends and family that BBQ. It's a must if you BBQ a lot. We use it on whole tri-tips and on rib eye roasts - in the oven or the BBQ. A small amount is also great on hamburgers. For tri-tips, spread a fair amount over the entire roasts. For rib eye roast, cover the outside but not the ends. It has a good mixture of salt, garlic, pepper and other spices.

It is the best flavor for beef by far we've tried and we continually get compliments about our brisket and burgers. I hope they will release it in lager quantities soon.

review/text: I love ramen noodles but stopped eating them because of the terrible ingredients and high sodium content.  I was so happy to find a healthy version.  I even use half of the season pack and they are still delicious.  My son loves them too.  Actually he asks for them every night!  And even with him, I only add half or even a quarter of the season pack.  I also add little chopped pieces of broccoli to the same water the noodles are boiled in for some extra vegetables and it's a great, quick, healthy meal for my 4 year old (and me!).

review/text: This brand is a lot healthier than other types of ramen. It can be cooked on the stove or in the microwave. I usually put in just enough water so that almost all of it cooks out. Using too much water makes this ramen taste flavorless. I also let it sit before eating so that the noodles soak up all of the flavor. If you cook this properly, it is very delicious.

review/summary: It's decent, but if you think this is the same you're in health-denial.
review/text: This is ok, though I must say out of the 3 I've tried, this, Garlic and Pepper, and Mushroom, this was the worst. There is just nothing savory about it, it completely lacks any umami. As a miso broth, it barely hints at the unique flavor of miso. Miso soup is generally pretty salty, and that's about the closest asset to the flavor of miso soup that this product achieves, and even then I'd say it's a little lacking. The broth is also too watery, and not in the way that I "added too much water", I mean in it's viscosity or consistency. It needs a slight touch of some sort of thickening agent or something. The noodles are ok, but they are just too slimy and watery as well.<br /><br />Overall, I've had some luck concerning adding additional things to this flavor to make it taste better, but once you start adding meat and salt, aside from the lack of MSG, you're sort of defeating the purpose of buying this particular brand of ramen. You may have better luck than me, but in the aspects of taste, consistency, savoriness and texture of the noodles, it just doesn't have the effect of other instant noodles. I'd also like to point out that I eat a lot of stuff for it's health benefits over it's taste, but I've learned from this product that what I liked about certain brands of instant ramen had to do with their ingredients and how they were made, and not the nature of instant ramen as a dish.<br /><br />EDIT: I'd like to note that obviously the noodles are the same in all the Koyo Ramen so my critiques of the noodles themselves apply to the other ones, but the other flavors I tried at least had enough of a redeeming flavor that I didn't see it necessary to write a review suggesting people avoid them.

If you are like me and  love ramen noodles, but hate the fact that there's a ton of fat (which is 14 grams per pack and 1660 mg of sodium for chicken flavor), try these.  I drain the water from my noodles and season them.  I do not eat it as soup.  I use half of the seasoning pack and a couple of spritzes of liquid aminos (tastes like soy sauce).  It ends up having 1 gram of fat and about 50% less sodium, and is very tasty.  Now those like me who like to cut some fat and salt can have their ramen noodles and eat them, too!  ; D.<br /> Ohh Haapppyyy Daayyy<br /><br />Now if only someone will make a Snickers with one gram of fat.  : (

review/text: This is an edit of my first review, where I said the price was a little high, but at that point I hadn't noticed that both my local Walmart and Target carry it for less than $9.<br /><br />So don't buy it here - though it's a great coffee. I use this coffee as a drip-grind coffee, not French-press or expresso where so many people love it. It's still 5 stars!<br /><br />This coffee is excellent: it's called a dark roast but it tastes more like a medium or medium-dark roast and doesn't have much bitter/burnt taste so common in such roasts. It's woody with a hint of a citrusy taste. It's a little creamy and earthy. There's a considerable complexity of tastes which reminds me of Eight O'Clock's Bocar Blend, but Bocar is not as bold - but it is around 2/3 the price.  Eight O'Clock's Columbian (my most-brewed in the AM coffee) is as bold with a little less complexity and a more woody taste, again at 2/3 the price. It most closely reminds me of Starbuck's Caffe Verona, which is a little more chocolately in taste and is usually around $8 for one about same sized bag at Amazon.

review/summary: Excellent formula!!! Best ever!
review/text: After trying multiple commercial formulas (could only breastfeed for 10 days due to medical issues), baby had major issues with feeding. He was severely constipated and began breaking out in a face/neck rash from forehead to neck (including his eyes). Researched this online and decided we needed an organic formula that is lactose free. This is the ONLY USDA certified organic formula without lactose (without using soy, which caused the baby's face/neck rash & didn't help his constipation). Within two days of using this formula, the baby's face rash disappeared, his bowels went back to normal, and he became a happy, energetic two month old (he went from screaming his head off hours each day to a baby who now can't stop cooing and smiling)! We could NOT be happier with this formula. It says "toddler" formula yet meets the FDA standards for infant formula. Nutritionally, it's soooo much better than commercial, non-organic formulas due to the USDA certified organic ingredients, it does not use corn syrup, and the formula now comes in BPA-free cans with a BPA-free scooper to measure the formula. Excellent excellent product! Shop around for better prices (I've been able to find some companies online offering this for $12 per can, free shipping, and no tax!)
