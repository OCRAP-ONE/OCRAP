review/summary: Good selection, bad counter
review/text: My sampler pack arrived the day after I ordered it, so kudos for quick delivery! Although I bought the 35 cup sampler, there were only 33 cups in the box, so the people packaging should be more careful. I would have made a stink about it, but since it's a great deal I thought it wasn't worth the time to complain. None of my cups were damaged.<br /><br />On to the coffee: I received a nice sampling of coffees...I think I got at least one of every coffee shown in the picture. Many were doubles, which is fine by me, and I was pleased that there were 7 decaf cups included (including the half caf). I'm loving the medium roast coffees so far...we have found the light roasts to be a little on the weak side (especially the flavored coffees), and this is a great way to sample different kinds without committing to a whole box. I recommend this option if you are new to the K Cups or you're looking for something different to try.<br /><br />So, overall, we are happy with this purchase. I would have given it 5 stars if they had given me all 35 k cups!

review/summary: Agree with Prev Review - not exactly as advertised... BUT
review/text: I wanted to back up a previous review that you really are NOT getting 35 medium roast K cups.  This is a nice assortment though and of my 35 I would have guess that half were medium roast - I also had about 10 bold or dark and about 7 or so DeCaf.  Personally I was OK with the mix and I like the selection - Decaf is great for a late day coffee!  Also note that the price fluctuates greatly on this I paid $27.50 at one point and my next order is under $18.  I have seen this on MANY items on AMAZON so keep an eye on that if you buy.  All in All though I thought this was a good deal!!

review/summary: Just what I wanted.
review/text: I was a bit hesitant when I first ordered this coffee because I am the only one who drinks coffee and if I was not happy with them, I would be drinking coffee, unhappily, for quite sometime.  Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was exactly what I was looking for and am enjoying them each day when I wake up and, at times, during the day.  I have served them to friends when they come to visit, and they have complimented me on how good the cup of coffee is.  I tell them that it was all done with the Keurig brewer and unfortunately, I had nothing to do with that cup of coffee.  They smile and enjoy their coffee.<br />I will be ordering this assortment again when the current one gets towards the end.

review/text: I love coffee and get really bored if I have to drink the same kind on a regular  basis.  This sampler pack provided me with so many different kinds of coffee so that I didn't have to purchase an entire pack of some kind that I might not have liked.

review/text: This collection<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TM5458">K-Cup Coffee for Keurig Brewers, Coffee Lover's Collection - 48 Count</a> works out to nearly one dollar a cup. I can see that manufacturers would like to sell a machine with a high use cost [just like cheap printers with cartridges that constantly have to be replaced] but surely most people will give some thought to the cost per cup. Costco sells a box of Tully cups at $37 for 80, less than fifty cents a cup.

Thus, you get all the freshness of a mint gum, with the tastiness of a fruity gum.  I very much enjoy this, and I usually have a pack in my desk.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: It's hard to describe this to people who have never sampled it, but basically it's a powder to which you mix milk and sugar to get a sweetened malted drink. It is supposed to promote sleep.<br /><br />Quite simply it's a comfort drink when plain milk just won't do. You can also call it malted milk or a hot sweet malt drink.<br /><br />In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately. It's actually named after the inventor, William Horlick.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, you can make it as malty or sweet as you like depending on how much of each you add to the milk. But to those who love and grew up on Holicks, it's just a great comfort drink.

review/summary: Ideal for a Chocolate Malt
review/text: This is a premier product, although pricey with shipping added in, for making a outstanding chocolate malt. I think that it is far superior to the typical products one finds on grocer shelves. My recipe for a Malt for 1 person is 1/2 pint chocolate or vanilla ice cream, 1/2 cup milk, 2 Tbs Horlicks Drinking Powder, and 2 Tbs chocolate syrup. Mix in a blender. Adjust as you see fit..... There are many recipes on the web.<br /><br />I also made a hot chocolate malt at breakfast one morning. I used 1 Tb Horlicks Drinking Powder, 3/4 cup of warm milk, and 1 Tb chocolate syrup. That also was good.<br /><br />Again if you love malt this product is an excellent choice.

review/text: This is a great tasting hot drink. It is not chocolate base like Milo or ovaltine. When added to milk the color of the milk barely changes. It gives the milk a smooth texture and a creamy taste. I mix 2 tbs with warm milk, sometimes I use sugar and sometime I don't. Without sugar added it still has a good taste. The only thing is the 300g container is very small I was expecting something a little bigger for $10.

review/summary: Very Good Meat Snack - Highly Recommended
review/text: Jack Link's "X-Stick Original" snack sticks are very good tasting and far less greasy than other "meat sticks" (like Slim Jim). These are great snacks for diabetics (like me) since they have a negligible amount of Net Carbs.<br /><br />The Amazon "Product Features" incorrectly lists these as 160 Calories each, and neither the box or individual packaging list the Nutrition Facts, so I visited the Jack Links web site and found the following:<br /><br />Serving Size: .5 Oz (1 stick)<br />Calories: 60 (45 from Fat)<br />Total Fat: 5g (2g Saturated Fat)<br />Cholesterol: 15mg<br />Sodium: 220mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 0g<br />Protein: 3g<br /><br />These do contain MSG, which can cause "gastric distress" in some people (like my dad).<br /><br />Overall, these are great as a snacks between meals and they are so much better than the competition.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Good Stuff!
review/text: These are along the line of Slim Jims but have a milder, less spicy, taste. The X-Sticks also have a much better texture than Slim Jims, these things actually look like they are made of real meat, NOT the 'mystery meat - goat hair/cardboard' texture of the modern Slim Jim.<br /><br />The X-Stick is 'not exactly' a health food snack. They have a fair amount of fat, a little over 5 grams (each stick, in this package, is 14 grams total mass). Sodium content is about 224 mg and, about 3.2 grams of protein and only 64 calories (about 47 calories from fat) per stick.<br /><br />What the X-Stick is, is a very satisfying snack. I sometimes have to miss a meal, due to my work. One or two of these take the hunger away and puts some energy back into me. I do try to limit my fat intake but do not feel guilty about snacking on these once in a while.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Ken

review/summary: Great Meat Snacks
review/text: This review is for the 0.5 ounce X-Sticks box of 50.<br /><br />First I will comment on the taste.  The X-Sticks have a mild and pleasing flavor to them.  They taste similar to Slim Jims, just without the chemical spiciness and odd plastic texture of Slim Jims.  In a taste test, the X-Sticks would win without a problem.<br /><br />Next is the price.  The price for the box of 50 0.5 ounce X-Sticks tend to fluctuate on Amazon but it's still worth it, provided the price stays below $20 a box.  When you combine this with the Subscribe and Save discount, you can save even more!  The price of the same type of Slim Jims is almost $10 higher, so once again, the X-Sticks win.<br /><br />So my final thoughts are if you're looking for a meat snack that isn't going to repeat on you an hour later, these are the way to go.  Although they can't claim to be "All natural", they have more natural ingredients than the Slim Jim.  These also are composed of beef and pork (yum), whereas a Slim Jim is composed of beef and mechanically separated chicken...  (Eww).  Anyway, I was very happy with this purchase and I highly recommend them for you.

review/summary: Good for a snack --
review/text: I can't really compare these to other similar products (Slim Jim,etc.), as I had never had jerky-type snacks before I got these.  I decided to take a long road trip (4500 miles round trip), and I have a tendency to get drowsy if I don't get enough protein.  I decided to carry these plus some string cheese in the car to tide me over between meal stops.<br /><br />I really like these.  The flavor is good, the texture is fine, and the "damage" from a diet standpoint is minimal (these are 60 cal apiece, based on the Jack Links site).  They're not too salty, either.  Having them on the trip from Bellingham, WA to St. Louis, MO and back was a huge help.  One or two of these provided just the right amount of tasty protein.  The size and packaging is handy, too, and easy to open when driving.<br /><br />I now keep them on hand for when I need a little pick-me-up.

review/text: This was my second purchase. Watching carbs, I look for snacks that are high protein with low or no sugars. Tiring of nuts all the time I tired these a couple months ago. Very surprised, they taste good with a bit of spice kick. Recalling that most convenience store sticks were dry or greasy or blah tasting, it was nice to snack on these. They are not the long sticks but a nice size at about 6 inches. Wrapped individually and easy to open. Great item to grab when looking for a quick munch.

review/summary: Just okay -- not nearly a Slim Jim
review/text: While certainly edible, I don't think Jack Links brings a realistic competitor here with their version of the Slim Jim.  Honestly, there are some bites I take which remind me of dog food.  I know we are talking about meat sticks here and not fine dining, but the texture of these is just not right, almost too granular.  I know Slim Jims have that greasy taste but these guys have a bit of it too and I have to admit I kind of enjoy it.  Overall, in my opinion, Slim Jims are much much better than these guys, but to each his/her own!

review/summary: A bit on the greasy side, but the kids love them
review/text: Some fairly improved ingredients vs a typical 'slim jim', at least its not made with jowls and pink slime.  The taste is good, salty, smoky, a bit on the greasy side.  If you've had the x-sticks, this is just small pieces of that in a bag, four times the weight of the stick.  In other words, excellent for sharing or a snack at school where eating a whole stick might be a problem.<br /><br />I also dump a package into a ziploc and can snack on it a piece at a time to boost my protein and fat intake a bit.<br /><br />A pack of 12 lasted my 7 year old and his friends about a week, which is way faster than most other meat snacks I've put on the snack counter.<br /><br />But even the 7-10 year olds say its a bit greasy, as they devour another package.

review/text: Having never had the X-Links before, I bought them based off some customer reviews I read here. Maybe I should have read more, but these are most comparable to a Slim Jim. While they are much better, they still fall into the same category, and I was looking for something a little more "real" tasting. These have a much better taste than Slim Jim does, although there is still a substantial "artificial" taste. Highly recommended as a Slim Jim upgrade, but don't buy these if you're looking for a more natural tasting product.

review/text: I just bought my second box of Jack's Links because I'm sold on these!  I purchased a box of small Slim Jim's for my son's lunch box and for throwing snacks in my bag for the long afternoons of driving kids around to activiities and someone ALWAYS asking if I have something to eat!!  The Slim Jims were just ok, but after time got really hard, even in their individually packaged cases.  So I bought the Jack Link's X Stick and immediately my 10 year old son said they were WAY better than Slim Jims.  The 0.5 oz size is a little bigger than the small Slim Jims, yet not too big so that I'm filling my kid with even more fat and junk.  This is just the right size for a "snack" and the price is great.  At Amazon today I bought a box of 50 on sale for $17, which is about .35 cents a stick.  Don't hesitate to buy these if you are like me and need a variety of on-the-go, non-refrigerated snacks or lunch box fillers!!  Great product!

I wouldn't even put them in the same universe as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFS57I">Jack Link's Beef Stick, Original, 0.92-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 72)</a> or any of the beef sticks that Jack Links makes based on the 'Original' formula/base. I dig all of their flavored stuff, spicy stuff, etc, as long as it's based on the original beef stick variety.<br /><br />The X Sticks taste... like potted beef, wrapped into a beef stick? I don't know, It's odd. I'm still going to eat all 50 of them or whatever; they're not awful. Just "okay"; and in my world of seriously loving beef jerky and beef sticks, being just "okay" is a crime...

review/summary: Jack Link's X-Sticks-Original Flavor
review/text: Very much enjoyed the product under review; however, one slight problem.  The extended length of the X-stick over the shorter length market -size.  Prefer the shorter length.  Also, I have purchased the 7.2 oz.size in my local market.  This is also a good product.  I might be interested in buying these in quantity fron Amazon if offered.  Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

review/summary: Different tastes
review/text: Guess people have different. They taste like Slim Jims with all the flavor and texture boiled out of them. Bologna sticks shaped like Slim Jims. Anyone want a box of 49?<br /><br />update: After some time I tried another. Not inedible. The more I ate, the better they tasted. I think I still prefer Slim Jims. A little more work to eat; spicier, with a little snap to the skin. But I'm raising my rating to 3 stars from 1.<br /><br />I couldn't find any nutrition information which I thought was required for food products made in the US. I don't really want to know what the put in these things anyway

review/summary: Pretty Good - Not Trash
review/text: Good stuff if you want a Slim Jim type of replacement that is of better quality.  Does not have that waxy taste that Slim Jim tends to offer.  If you want real beef jerky I'd pass on this.  In fact, I assumed they would be more like the regular bagged Jack Links (myfault) just in stick form.  This has that mixed spiciness that you cant really find in any of their regular flavors but did remind me of Slim Jim.  Tastes like a hot dog in a way which is good and they tend to do the job as far as giving me a boost.  I give it 3 stars but I am going right back to the regular bagged stuff which so wayyyyy better.

review/summary: Great Deal for a Tasty Snack
review/text: These were only .19 each after getting 40% off with Amazon's snack sale, which is incredibly cheap.<br /><br />My hubby likes them in his lunches and I like giving him anything that isn't loaded with sugar or starches.<br /><br />I recently had a Slim Jim after about 20 years without trying them and it was awful. I like the flavor of Jack's Links ten times as much.<br /><br />Easy to get into the package, too, just peel it back.

Makes a great protein snack any time of day. Even the picky eaters in the family love these. Also love these come from my home state.

review/summary: Good jerky for a quick snack
review/text: I had tried one of the Jack Links snack pack, the kind that come with cheese, pretzel and meat, so after trying that, and loving it, I knew Id most likely enjoy this.  I took a bite from the first stick, and it wasn't too good, I guess it naturally tastes better with cheese IMO, but after eating the second and then third, they started to grow on me.  These things are perfect for that late snack and its convenient and does the trick for a hungry tummy.  They have a chewy consistency, but when you take a bite each time, you can hear a small snap from when you bite<br /><br /> I also like the design, you just remove a piece of cardboard from the bottom and it becomes a dispenser, which is a little nice idea. I ended up liking these so much, I am going to subscribe to receive these once a month.  Price is great and if you do that, you get a nice little discount (15% off).  I definitely recommend this.

review/summary: Individual Jack Links best for sharing
review/text: Have to admit I've never had Jack Links X-Stick (or any other Jack Links product) and have NO idea what they taste like.  I bought these because I know a Marine in Afghanistan loves them and so do his buddies.<br />This particular item is perfect for military CARE packages: each unit is individually wrapped so nothing goes stale or gets sand in it after the box is opened.<br />The small-size box is great for people without a lot of storage or 'personal' space.  The single-servings are ideal for sharing (without wiping yourself out of goodies) and fit into cammy pockets without taking up a lot of room or adding to the weight you're carrying.<br />They make a welcome change from MRE's or when you need a quick energy boost (the convoy can't always stop for lunch).<br />Even if you don't know if your 'fighter' likes them, I guarantee they'll be appreciated - remember when the kids traded lunches in school?  They may be older but trading goodies within the unit is a time-honored tradition, too!

review/summary: Meh
review/text: Edible, but not great. I picked these up because Amazon had stopped carrying Pemmican beef jerky (which hadn't been the same since the company was sold anyway) and I was looking for something to snack on. I like Slim-Jims ok when they're good (but quality control is a major issue with Slim-Jims, as for every good one you get, you're likely to get one that tastes rancid or worse).<br /><br />Obviously, these aren't like beef jerky, they're closer to Slim-Jims. The consistency seems to be much better than Slim-Jims and the price is pretty good. The flavor isn't as good as a good Slim-Jim, but is much better than a bad one, so it kind of evens out.<br /><br />I was hoping these would be closer to the "Matador" line of snack sticks that Jack Link's makes. For whatever reason, despite carrying many Jack Link's products at present, Amazon doesn't seem to have the Matador line.

review/summary: Great for my low-carb diet
review/text: I first learned to like Wasa crackers (or crispbreads, as they're called) from my old Finnish surrogate mother. But I never took them very seriously until a year ago when my doctor put the heat on me to lower my carbs and lose some weight. Actually, the doctor scared the hell out of me. So I got serious. Since then, I have essentially quit eating bread. But, I like sandwiches for lunch. What to do? Voila! Everything that I used to eat on bread, I now eat on a Wasa--and sesame is my favorite flavor. So with no real effort (other than switching to Splenda instead of sugar), I'm down 30 pounds in a year. I'm wearing clothes that I haven't worn in five years.
