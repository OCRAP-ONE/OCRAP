review/summary: Hazelnut milk is amazing
review/text: Hazelnut milk is my favourite stand-in for milk, having almost entirely replaced it in my diet. I don't even have a problem with milk, hazelnut milk is just better. When you eat cereal in the morning with ordinary milk, the cereal is great at waking you up for the day, but the milk brings you down - not so with hazelnut milk! Eating breakfast with hazelnut milk just gets you primed! The same concept applies amazingly well to hot chocolate. Standard hot chocolate is delicious but you know all that sugar and dairy is going to make you want to take a nap afterwards. Hot cocoa with hazelnut milk instead is amazing! You don't need as much sugar, the taste is like some kind of magical nutella drink, and the nut fats leave you feeling fantastic. Try it. Feel better about life.

If you are someone who enjoys crunchiness in a cookie...then this is the cookie for you but if you like softer cookies like myself....then better look else where! Also, the ad doesn't really specify that these cookies are not soft. The picture makes it look like you will be receiving soft cookies when in actuality it is not. One good thing about these cookies is that the flavors were great! Chocolate chip, Triple Chocolate and Key Lime.

review/text: I just love these little packets.  I know if I have a need for a lunch on the go, I can just grab one of these, and I'm covered.  Little premade packet of tuna salad (not a can.  Yay!), just enough crackers to use without extra after I'm done, a spoon to get the tuna out, a napkin to clean up with, and a mint so I don't smell like tuna all day.  Perfect.  I keep one in the glove compartment, one in the desk, and one in the bookbag.  Best emergency lunch I've found, and this is a pretty great price for 12.

review/text: Our family loves tuna, and it was nice to find these grab-and-go lunch packs.  The tuna in the pouch is moist but not soggy, and the crackers are fresh and plentiful.

Great for a light lunch, or a snack, or just to have on hand if hunger strikes.

review/summary: Tuna. Just like it says.
review/text: If you like Tuna, then you love these. Pre-Made (mixed) with mayo. If you don't like Mayo you can order some that is just straight up Tuna, it'll always come with a mayo packet though.<br /><br />I'm an EMT and have been working as one for 6 years. I've also been eating Fast Food for 6 years... i decided to eat better, so i got these. Whenever i felt hungry i would eat a pack and it would hold me over for a few hours. (Don't eat too much in one day, Tuna and other sea foods have high Mercury content, I ate 3 a day at different times). I would alternate between tuna, fruit, meats like chicken / turkey breast. I highly recommend this product to everybody that's always moving and doesn't really have time to eat something healthy. you can literally eat it right out of the bag, which is what i do. I just open it up and press with my fingers and "slurp" it up, then bite a cracker, perfect for on the go.

review/summary: 12-gram Monster Pod Not Significantly Better
review/text: I usually buy the 10-gram, see my review of the coffee quality there. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LQTGNE">Baronet Coffee Nutty Irishman Medium Roast, 18-Count Coffee Pods (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />This time I tried the 12-gram 16 per box. Same excellent coffee. Brewed the same way with a Cuisinart Cup-O-Matic, the larger size made very little difference. Additionally, so far 2 of the pods were split a little, spilling some of the coffee out. I can't be sure it didn't happen from tearing open the packet; perhaps you need to be more careful opening the larger pod packets.<br /><br />Bottom line for me: The difference between the 12-gram and the 10-gram wasn't significant. And the Baronet pods that are loose in bags contain only 7.77 grams per pod. So I will stick with the 10-gram 18-count.

review/text: My husband is a vegetarian who has not eaten meat since he was 12 years old.  He does not even remember what meat tastes like.  It is very difficult for the two of us to find a meat substitute that I will enjoy as well, and even harder to find one that I am willing to use instead of the real thing.  Hain Gravy Mix is one of those rare gems that I am happy to use.  The flavor is authentic and great, and it is SOOO quick and easy to make.  Plus, it's a lot healthier (which is worthwhile when you don't have to trade in flavor).  This one gets an enthusiastic 5/5 stars.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Love this stuff!  Perfect for vegetarians (not for vegans)!
review/text: As I was transitioning to a vegetarian lifestyle, the very last thing I gave up was meat-based gravy.  In the fifteen years of being a vegetarian, I have consumed a lot of vegetarian gravies.  Some were good and others downright awful.  I recently picked up two of Hain's vegetarian gravy mixes -- one packet of the chicken flavored and one packet of the brown gravy.  I tried the chicken flavor today and it was fantastic.  I cannot wait to try the brown gravy.  I love mashed potatoes and having an excellent gravy is simply joyous for me.  I will probably be eating mashed potatoes for the next month.<br /><br />The gravy cooks up quickly and the only ingredient you need to complete your gravy is water.  The packet produces a cup of gravy (four servings total) and, depending on your stove, can take less than five minutes to whip up.<br /><br />What is a little disappointing to me is that I will not be able to offer this to some of my family members as they are vegan.  (This product contains milk.)  I also found that you had to be prompt about serving the gravy once off the stove.  It can congeal and become lumpy once removed from heat. In addition, a single packet does not yield much product.  Due to the tendency of the product to congeal, I did add a little extra water, which made the gravy a little smoother and, naturally, provided a little more gravy.

review/summary: Good catfood, very poor delivery time
review/text: I would give five stars to the food, but only one star for the delivery time. Our two cats are big and eat a lot, so I thought it would be much easier to order through Amazon and get it sent right to our house, than go to the grocery often to pick up a case or two. Even though Amazon's price is a little higher, saving on gas and time, it seemed worth it.<br /><br />It is difficult to know what cats will like, so while ours love this food, and won't eat any other flavor I've tried, I'm sure they'd agree that it is 5-star. However, anybody else's cats may not agree, so that is always a tossup as to what they will go for. Cats is weird.<br /><br />What was exceptionally disappointing is the ridiculous shipping wait. It was listed as 4-5 weeks just to ship, and I don't know how long the stuff will be in transit, as I am still waiting for it.<br /><br />Trying to anticipate how much to order, and when, with such a long time just to ship out these is probably not worth the trouble. I brought this to the attention of Amazon via email, and their reply was pretty fuzzy, talking about different shipping locations.<br /><br />In any case, if you order 3-4 cases at a time as I do, you will have to have a lot already in your house before taking a chance or ordering this.

Seriously, I have to monitor my account almost every day.  The prices jump around from $9/case to $17/case ALL THE TIME.  I did not understand that part when I signed up for subscribe and save.  In the beginning, I ended up paying $17/case a few times (becuz I was not watching to see what the price was on my shipment day).  I can get it at WalMart for $10-$11/case.  I figured, subscribing meant locking in the price, and that is not the case with this program.  Now I watch them alot and I am just cancelling and re-activating everything all the time.  I will only do this if it is cheaper for me than I pay at WalMart.  I have lots of cats and I also feed strays, so I need to save money on catfood whenever possible.

review/summary: My cat sings Frikies' praises!
review/text: When my cat adopted me at a local shelter, I had no clue what kind of food is good for a kitten. All my dogs are on grain-free dry food. So naturally I started him on dry food. Later on, I tried different wet food but he refused them.<br /><br />My cat is not an eager eater. He gets unlimited supply of dried food throughout the day, and he always finishes fixed amount which is in line with vet's recommendation. He also snacks on Pounce throughout the day, but mostly he prefers just to play. Play with his hyperactive adopted doggie siblings, his adopted human, or any newly discovered toys. He plays non-stop about 80% of his awake time. Food comes second in priority. That was all true, until he met the Friskies canned cat food months later.<br /><br />The first time my cat tried the Friskies savory shreds whitefish and tuna in sauce, he hestiated just like when he first encountered cheese, yogurt, or small chunks of steak. But unlike steaks or cheese which he simply left untouched nowadays, he took one lick of the Friskies shreded seafood and he gulbbed down whatever he could fit into his tiny tummy. Since then, he's fed a mix of dry and wet food. He still gets unlimited dried food through the day and only one meal of wet food at night (mixed with dry food). He's usually not very vocal and hardly talk. But when he sees his wet food coming in the special bowl, he would follow the bowl and sing all the way to his dinning area.<br /><br />Like all pet owners, I hope my cat would always eat a healthy and balanced diet. I also wish he would prefer some food that would smell more pleasing to human sense than his current favorite, this Friskies. But being such a good, well behaved, and healthy pet, I think he deserves something he likes so much. My cat has been on a mix of dry and wet food for a few months now. He's long and lean like a 10 pound tiger. And the vet is giving him a clean bill of health. One day he may grow tired of this, or gain enough weight for us to be alarmed. But as long as he stays healthy and fit and sings the Friskies' praises, this will remain his nighttime snack!

review/summary: Something's different...
review/text: The Salmon Shreds are our cat's favorite (he's a picky 17 year old veteran).  Our local Walmart doesn't have this flavor so I usually get it at the expensive grocery store around the corner.  I was thrilled to find it cheaper on Amazon.  However, even though it's the same brand, same flavor, and not expired, he will hardly pick at the food from the ordered cans.  Thinking that perhaps he got tired of the Salmon Shreds I just bought a can around the corner for comparison, and he's really chowing down.  So perhaps the flavor of the ordered cans changed because they underwent some drastic temperature change, or maybe it's a different batch - don't have a clue.  Just wish I hadn't ordered 2 cases at once.

review/summary: My cats like the Shreds varieties
review/text: We have a few cats, so finding flavors they agree on was hard at first.  In this shreds or shredded type, almost all the flavors have met with their approval.<br /><br />We try to feed a variety of flavors in various cat foods to keep things interesting, but every morning we offer one can of shreds because it's always eaten by someone who preferred it to another offering. Of all the flavors, the two that have become the staples in our house are the chicken/salmon and the whitefish/tuna.  The others are just fine too, but these are the favorites.<br /><br />Even our one cat who prefers dry foods likes these, and really digs lapping up the gravy.<br /><br />This is available at our supermarket for about 45 cents a can, and we'd love to see it on Subscribe and Save at a more competative price than the current almost 80 cents a can offered.  If the S&S price were closer, we'd sign up for it.

review/summary: Not sure how old these are, but at 19.18 a case they are 70 cents a can
review/text: I ordered these to see if it might save me the trouble of buying at the store.  My cats only eat the chicken savory shreds, so when I saw they had this, I ordered it without realizing how much per can I was actually paying.  I pay no more than 50 cents per can at the local grocery store (sometimes they are on sale and much lower) so here I overpaid by a long shot.  I paid 19.18, which comes out to 70 cents per can. So then, I go to feed my cats some of this food, their absolute favorite, and they take a bite and walk away.  The only explanation I can possibly come up with for this is that this batch of canned cat food is not fresh. When I get it from the local store, they eat it all and want more.<br />So there has got to be something different about these cans and I suspect that they have been sitting in a warehouse way too long.  I won't order them online again.

review/text: When my rescued stray, Goldie, unexpectedly presented me with four kittens a few years ago, mealtime soon went from "Meow" to "Yuck."  All the little cats had different taste buds it seems.  The household went through several brands of canned cat food flavors with some untouched plates, some barely there plates, and a couple of clean plates.  The day the cats were introduced to Frskies Savory Shreds with Salmon was a day to celebrate.  All the cats love it!  The only reason it didn't get five stars is because I have sloshed salmon sauce on myself and the floor several times.  It could be a bit thicker maybe.

But then, fish is not their fav.<br />Friskies Tuna/chicken with gravy IS their fav, but obviously pure fish (even in sauce) is only "OK."<br />They eat it, albeit slowly...but they do eat it, cleaning down to the bowl.<br /><br />I buy it for variety, along with turkey in gravy and chicken in gravy. Beef? Nope. Beef is another no no in my house. They won't eat beef, even if I give it from my own hamburger...go figure. Cats!<br /><br />And if you thought that I put them into this groove, you'd be wrong. I tried umpteen different brands, flavors, textures, even organic and raw. But over the period of a year, we're down to about 4 or 5 different selections of gravy-laden food, and that's it. 3 are kittens; 1 is 5 yrs old; 1 old gal on a diet for obesity (not much anymore), however, will eat almost, that is almost everything I give her.<br /><br />The kids' main diet is Natural Balance Reduced Calorie, dry. It is on self-feed and they all like it...amazing.<br />They get only 1 can of wet food divided by 5, once or twice a day.

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are ground yellow corn, corn gluten meal, and chicken by-product meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a cheap corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs." Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Friskies at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, dry foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

I tried a Caribou K-Cup of coffee, which is considered pretty premium, and then a Starbucks K-Cup coffee back-to-back, and this definitely won out!  It is definitely stronger, and makes Caribou taste weak.  $25 for 15 of these is very expensive though, but I guess that's because you can't find variety packs in stores.  I buy the breakfast blend (10 K-Cups) of Starbucks at the grocery store for $11 (pretty standard for a K-Cup) and I think it's a great value.  Starbucks K-Cups deserve more love!

I even tried to buy my own grounds and use the filter for grounds but i couldnt get that strong, flavorful coffee i was used to with my old coffee machine. Starbuck's proves to have the best kcups to me so far. very satisfied. I will be buying bulk of these.

That said, beans go stale; you might run out; you can't brew small amounts very well. The Keurig cups supposedly (nitrogen sealed?) have a fairly long shelf life; I won't know until some time passes. If they don't store well, I'll have to find something else.<br /><br />In the meantime, all five varieties are very similar in taste and character while being slight muddy. The French Roast I'm drinking right now has an after taste not unlike "Tasters Choice" and the aroma is queer when sampled with a nose right in the cup, unnatural even.<br /><br />Shipped and delivered very quickly. A few of the cups were "deflated"; the seals were no longer "domed". I don't think that's right, I won't be using those.

review/text: I have 4 cats that are all 18 years old.  My vet continues to be amazed that they are as healthy and spry as they are, at their age.  They are all rescued animals who had very rough lives before coming to me.  I attribute their amazing health in no small part to their food.  I've always given them food with no by-products (Wellness and a few other brands) but when they hit 17, I started noticing a marked decline in their energy levels and appetite.  It wasn't until I tried Innova that the trend reversed itself completely.  They've always had incredibly soft and glossy coats, but the EVO has even improved that too.  My half Bengal's fur truly feels better than silk.  They've been eating the Innova for a year now and play like kittens again.  I couldn't be happier with the quality of the food or the results in my babies' quality of life.  You can't go wrong with Innova.

review/text: Both my cats Love this food.  I have tried many brands of canned food, and my two cats just nibble at it, then walk away.  However, they gobble up this EVO food. I like the fact that it not filled with cereal and fillers, like so many other cat foods, and that it is OK for kittens as well as cats.

review/text: I have 4 cats and one of them is a 14 wk old kitten. Great to have one type of food that is GOOD for any age cat. / They took to the food without any complaints. 2 of my cats are very stomach sensitive and have allergies but with this NEW food we've had no adjustment issues./ Despite the higher costs for this food.... it is worth every penny. To know that this food does not have the wheat gluten present that has killed so many other animals. I love my pets and it would just be the the worst thing I could imagine to serve them some food that would cause them harm or death./I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!

review/summary: Has made such a difference in my cats' health
review/text: For years I struggled with trying to help my obese cats lose weight -- they were very restricted in how much they were allowed to eat, but just couldn't stop gaining the pounds.  I was feeding them what I thought was a high-quality food, Nutro, especially given the price.  The vet suggested I switch to all wet, which I did but they still didn't lose any weight.  Finally the vet suggested a grain-free diet, and I began purchasing Innova Evo.  WOW, what a difference!  It did take about 2 months to adjust the cats to the new diet...which I did by feeding them a mixture of Innova (non-grain free) and Innova Evo grain-free, but each week scaling back the amount of non-grain free.  Both cats have really started dropping weight at a healthy rate.  But that's not even the most amazing change.  One of our cats had always had bad dander, but after switching her food the dander has completely cleared up, and her fur is so soft!  Our other cat had episodes of not only chewing her paws, but of throwing up her food.  The chewing has stopped and she hasn't regurgitated once since the food change.  The only down side is how strongly the food smells, but they use the litter box less, so it's a trade-off.

review/summary: This Food Will Change Your Cat's Life!
review/text: When my cat suffered severe weight loss due to vomiting after a misdiagnosed case of bladder stones, I did extensive research on what the best possible food would be to nurse him back to his former self. EVO dry, Orijen dry and Nature's Variety dry were the three foods that I chose, and both of my cats preferred the taste of EVO (though I'd recommend any of them as excellent grain-free choices). I wanted to integrate canned food in order to help him keep up the best urinary health I could. Unfortunately, he is not a fan of canned food. Until I tried the EVO canned formula! He loves it, especially when I add an extra half can of warm water to the food. It's packed full of nutrition, protein and lots of all-important moisture. Try it and you will definitely see an improvement in your cat's health (skin, coat, energy level -- everything). The first time my other cat tasted it she meowed at me for 15 minutes while licking her chops as if to say, "Yum!"

review/summary: THE BEST CAT FOOD - PERIOD
review/text: I have four older cats.  One of them seemed very, very ill.  Two of them had horrible skin.  I changed their food to this after a trip to the vet.  Within a week - their skin was healthy again & they just looked gorgeous.  This is worth the $.  More than any of the Iams, Science Diet - any of them.  This is what cats would eat in the wild.  I am one of the cheapest people on the planet - but this is worth my hard earned $.  AND is way cheaper than a trip to the vet.  I truly believe this food saved my cat's life.

review/summary: Great for my picky 7 year old
review/text: When I ordered this food, I was expecting to wait longer than usual for it to arrive, but it came in less than one week.  I was also worried that my 2 cats, especially the older 7 year old, would not eat it, because since Petco stopped stocking Innova pouches, their favorite food before the pet food scare in early 2007, I've had some problems finding a reliable replacement.<br /><br />I decided to upgrade their food to something more nutritious, and tasty, away from Science Diet, which had been their emergency food replacement, and Innova was recommended on a holistic pet nutrition website, as an all wet foot diet (which is supposed to be the next best thing to a raw food diet), so I bought a case on Amazon, hoping for the best.<br /><br />When I opened the can, the cat seemed more interested in sunning at first, but then was soon seen eating half the can, much more than she usually eats.<br /><br />The food has 12% protein content, while Science Diet is only 9%.  It also has Vitamin E, amino acids, mineral chelates, and some vegetables that are good for carnivores.  It doesn't contain any grains or meat by-products, but does have carrageenen, which I believe is a thickener, but I could be wrong.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased with this product.  I will be ordering again from this merchant because the process went so smoothly and it arrived at my door sooner than expected.

review/summary: Extremely picky eater loves this food
review/text: My cat is extremely picky when it comes to food - I had to get a new brand of cat food each month or two, and he would only eat wet food that's sliced or cubbed in gravy. After the poisonous wheat glutten incident I had to stop feeding him those cuts and gravy style foods because all of them contain wheat glutten. Even if they are not contaminated I still feel uneasy about it. So I research all of the web and found this unique food. It's not available in regular stores so you have to go to their website to find specialty stores that carry them. Anyway, I was so happy to see that my cat loves this food, both the dried and the mushy canned version. I now feed him 1 can of EVO wet food and some dried EVO kibbles plus low-sodium chicken stock (he won't drink plain water) each day. It's been 3 months since I switched his food and he still seems to love it. In fact, he's getting FAT on this diet because I over fed him (he asks for food whenever I go to the kitchen, and he gives me that sad look so I feel guilty if I don't feed him). I am starting to cut down on his ration and minimize my trip to the kitchen. I also hope the cooler weather will encourage him to go out more and burn off those extra calories.<br />I read a lot about benefits of this food but honestly only my cat knows. His fur is very soft but not really shiny (don't remember if it was ever shiny). Don't know about litter box odor because he goes outside. Energy-wise, well, he's a lazy cat and sleeps a lot and nothing can make him run a marathon.

review/summary: Questioning if EVO is still a good food
review/text: I have been feeding my cats EVO Duck for the past 5-6 years. I recently changed back over to Wellness and Felidae as I have noticed that the EVO food has been changing colors. It (EVO Duck for cats) is now a nasty gray color, no longer the rich red/brown color duck is known to have. It also has no congealed juice/gravy on the top of the food any more. This is usually found in good cooked food made with fowl.<br /><br />Over the past 2 months I have noticed a change in smell, color and consistency. Another clue that something was different was that my cats had started getting sick after eating, lots of vomiting. It was starting to smell like regular old rancid cat food where with old EVO you could actually smell what meat was used (it actually smelt GOOD). It makes me wonder what kind of rendered crap is in there now!<br /><br />I have written P&G and was promised that there would be no change made in recipe, meat sources and other ingredients within the first year. The year anniversary for the buyout was in January 2011. I had been assured a few months ago that they would still be procuring everything (same grade) from the same sources that EVO had used before being bought out. With that year over with, I have seen new changes every time I look in a can.<br /><br />Having worked in a vet hospital in the past, I know that pet food industries are NOT required to make changes on the food label until 6 months AFTER the change has been made in the formula. I am very aware of the mess P&G got into with the Melamine a few years ago and I don't want to risk it. I have opted to go back to Wellness (yes they had a recall recently, but were great about quickly buying back food. They also have put in other measures that I am comfortable with to prevent this from occurring again)and Felidae. Both of these foods are manufactured by original owners who have set standards with both brands.<br /><br />I will not risk it and I would advise anyone thinking about EVO to do a little homework before purchasing. It looks to me like they are charging top dollar for sub standard quality.

review/summary: No more diabetes!  Thank you Evo!
review/text: My 11 year old cat was diagnosed with diabetes, put on science diet prescription cat food and insulin.  He was still lethargic, wouldn't lose weight and stayed pretty much in one spot.  The science diet was a big waste of money and did nothing for my cats diabetes.  Without the insulin my cats level would spike to almost 400.  Yes I did say 400.  We honestly thought there was no hope of ever being off insulin.  He was checked for ketones and by some stroke ok luck, he did not have them.<br /><br />We took him to a different vet after months and months on insulin, and science diet.  This vet suggested feeding him evo.  I had never even heard of it.  I have to say within 2 days he stopped gulping down water and cried for food less.  He began literally exploring the house again.  He stopped peeing outside the liter box not long after this.  Now thanks to evo my cat is losing weight, fun again, purrs constantly..... And the best part?  No more insulin!!!!! Yes this food changed not only my cats life, but ours.  No more running to get home to give insulin.  No more constant vet trips.  No more "accidents" outside the box.  No more 100 dollars a pop bottles of insulin!  My cat is happy, healthy, has a shiny coat and his blood sugar is around 60 daily.  I can't say enough about this product.  It truly is a life saver!!!! Try this food before insulin if possible.  Ask your vet.... This food is amazing.  Thank you so much evo!!!!!

review/text: My 12-year old cat was diagnosed with diabetes a couple of years ago.  He needed 5 units of insulin twice a day, and he weighed 17.8 pounds.  After switching him off dry food and onto Innova Evo, he has lost 3.8 pounds, and his daily insulin dosage is 1.5 units twice a day.  He weighs 14 pounds now and plays like a kitten.

review/summary: Wonder food - best food for healthy cats!
review/text: I've always fed my cats "good" food, per my vet's recommendations (Royal Canin (sp) or Science Diet). But I made a crazy mistake when my cats turned 7; given Science Diet recommends a switch to a geriatric food at age 7, I changed to the geriatric formula.  BAD decision. I have Siamese cats (boy weighed 9# and girl weighed 7#) - over the course of 9 months, they each lost about a pound, which is a LOT for these little guys!  Talked to my vet and he said my cats definitely did NOT need a geriatric diet yet.  They are extremely active, as are most Orientals.<br /><br />Instead of switching back to their old Science Diet, I asked friends who did rescue work and friends who were breeders for their recommendations: they all swore by Innova Evo.  I started my cats on it and they LOVED it - and put back on the weight they lost. I also increased the amount of wet food in my cats' diet, as they previously ate predominantly dry food diet with a small amount of wet food as a treat. The change had other positives: I noticed they were vomiting less than they had in the past and my male cat, who had long suffered with allergies got better.  (This was a big deal, as he has been through extensive testing and we've tried MANY foods to help his allergies.) The only negative is that my female cat, who always had the silkiest fur, lost some of the silk and luster in her fur.  I have no idea what Science Diet puts in the food that Innova Evo doesn't have, but there was a marked change. I talked to my vet and he put both of them on Fel-V omega-3 oils, and my little girl regained most of the silkiness of her coat.<br /><br />Over time, my cats started to quit eating the Innova Evo and I experimented with some of the Innova foods with some grains, but they were only mildly interested.  My cats are finicky eaters and they get tired of the same wet food after awhile.  So, I went back to giving them many varieties of Fancy Feast (they share a 3 oz can as a dinner-time treat, as most of their diet is dry food, which they love).  They had regained the weight and were healthy.<br /><br />Jump ahead seven years.  My cats are now just shy of 15, and about six months ago, I realized my boy was losing some weight. I took him to the vet, and he checked out fine - just getting older. He still loves to eat, so I decided it was time to pack in more nutrition and calories in what he eats. Given my prior positive experience with Innova Evo, I went back to it.  My cats have again taken to it well, and my little boy has gradually regained some weight.  (Both cats remain active, racing through the house, playing, etc.) When I went to get the Innova, I was thrilled to find that there were more flavors of Innova available than I could find seven years ago (might just have been the pet store I used).  Perfect!  With the variety of flavors, I've been able to provide them some variety in their diet, while still knowing they're getting nutritious food (the regular Innova has grains, but is still a well-balanced, superior cat food, and I work the Innova Evo in as much as I can).<br /><br />When I changed my cats' wet food to Innova, I realized they also made a dry food with salmon and herring (my cats are seafood lovers, with chix as a second choice).  I got them started on the Innova dry food and they love it, too!  It's got about 3 times the protein of most "commercial" dry foods.<br /><br />I'm committed to ensuring my cats have long, healthy lives, and I'll be staying with Innova!  Nothing else compares (in my opinion - and I've tried a lot of foods due to my boy's allergies).  You've got nothing to lose my giving it a try - because it's so nutrition dense, the higher cost actually balances out.

review/summary: Evo
review/text: My cats, both himalayans, are doing well on this food. My first himmy had dietary problems and I had to feed him a special diet. When he passed away at the young age of 12 I bought another himmy kitten and then another one. I noticed that the first kitten had constant diarrhea type stools(half solid,ending with diarrhea)and I noticed that he was very sleepy and lethargic during the day. The food I was feeding him at the time was Merrick. Later on I would find out that cats are not suppose to be eating that many grains,fruits and vegetables so I switched to EVO which has more protein and higher fat content and is more closer to their natural dietary requirements. It has made a difference though not as much of a difference as I would have liked. Maybe he will get better through time on this diet. What I  can tell you is that in the past month that I have switched over  he has no more diarrhea and has a little more energy. He also drinks a lot more water and I'm hoping that this is not a problem. If it keeps up I will come back and comment. Its so important to buy your cats the food that is best for them and not something that you like. They weren't meant to eat what people eat. A breeder once told me that she sold a cat to a woman who only gave it what she ate and didn't buy cat food. The kitten died about 4 months<br />later.When she came back to buy another and the breeder found out what she did she didn't sell her anymore kittens. So stupid but I had to use as an example to make the point. A cat will die w/o it's proper nutrition even if you are "feeding" it. So if you don't feed a cat what it was meant to eat then you are taking years off of its life. Don't buy inferior food if you love your cat.<br /><br />This is an update: I didn't continue to use this food because my cats became too constipated. I switched to Wellness and they have done the best with this food. What can I say. When I tried EVO they practically slept near their water bowl.(High protein food makes cats thirsty!) Now they are happy and healthy.

review/text: I have a diabetic cat and this food is awesome.  I also thought, how nice to have it delivered to my house for close to the same costs as I was paying in a very smelly pet store.  BUT my main complaint not about amazon but that this is coming from another associated company...it did NOT arrive during the estimated time but 5 days later than that.  In all total from order to delivery it took 17 days to receive my order!!!  Had I know that I would have either ordered MUCH earlier or not at all!  The final complaint is that this does not qualify for free shipping even thought the cost is over 25 dollars.  Maybe again because it is an affliated company or due to the weight.  This too made my wait and the costs to wait less appealing.

review/summary: Great vegan (and gluten frree) frittata.
review/text: I bought this product on a whim when I saw it at the local grocer and was very happy with the results. I've never had frittata before this, so I cannot compare it to a traditional egg-based frittata, but this was simple to make and came out delicious as a side for pilaf. It reminds me of a cross between polenta and cornbread - slightly bread-like, a little damp, flaky, and delicious.<br />I like the edible rosemary in the mix. Most times when a product comes with rosemary already in it, the leaves are horribly dried out from being old, but this is quite the opposite. Gives an excellent flavor.<br />I only use 500ml of water when I make this to make it a bit firmer. I also cut back on the salt, but I feel that it does need a little to bring the flavors together.<br />Also, this is a product that just happens to be gluten free! Great for making meals where everyone feels welcome at the table.

review/summary: vegan, gluten free, and delicious...
review/text: I love that this is simple to make, and fits into my family's nutritional needs.  Takes about 3 minutes to dump the water, oil, salt, and cinque into a bowl and whisk it up.  I cook it for 16 minutes and then let it set for ten.  Definitely take the time to let it set even if you ignore everything else in the directions.  I use my cast iron skillet - 9", and it works perfectly.  I spray with a bit of oil to prevent sticking and it comes out easily.  Not sure how other pans handle it.<br /><br />With reference to the above review about the simplicity of ingredients, I take a different view:  I really like that there are only two ingredients.  No unnecessary fillers, preservatives, chemicals...nothing.  I have tried to make something similar with store bought chickpea flour, but it didn't work well at all.  Apparently, Lucini's 'special milling process' does have a purpose and really made a difference to the finished product...it turned out to be a completely different beast (and not as good as Lucini's by a landslide).<br /><br />I like to get creative with this product - it is such a great blank canvas.  Sometimes I cook up the entire package per the directions and serve it up sliced like I would a pie.  Other times, I will only use a half a cup to a cup of the batter and use it as a base for pizza toppings.  I set the temp to about 400 and just keep an eye on it, then switch it to broil so it gives me a nice crispy-without-being-brittle crust.  Or I cook it on lower heat with no broil and roll it up for a nice wrap, filling it with falafel balls, hummus, and homemade taboule.  I wonder if I can use the plain variety and make a sweet something with it.  I've also tried the Chili flavour and just love it - but for those sensitive to heat, it does have a good swift kick to it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there isn't much to compare this product to, so it is hard to describe to those that haven't tried it.  I think frittata does an all right job, though I'd say (for when I make the full-batch, anyway) it is a bit custardy, or creamier than a fritatta would be.<br /><br />For the calorie conscious and salt-avoiders, I have made it without both of these ingredients and it turned out just fine, so I think playing around and finding what works best for you won't spell disaster.<br /><br />This stuff now has a dedicated spot in my pantry, it is just so versatile, filling, simple, and healthy.  Love it.

review/summary: Not Like I Remember
review/text: There were just of few grape, blue & green, there were a TON of red, my least favorite.  The packaging is cheesy, the sucker is smaller and several were broken.  I remember Charms being packaged in nice cellophone and the sucker was thicker and larger.  My favorite was grape, although it was sweet, there was a tartness to it.  I'm not sure if my memory enhances what was my favorite candy or this sucker is really is not the same.  Either way, it was disappointing to me!

review/text: Although I hesitated about ordering for fear of the lollipops arriving broken (as happened to several other reviewers), I was unable to find these in any local stores so I took a chance.  They all arrived in excellent condition.  Although I prefer the taste of the original Sweet Pops, my kids love these.

review/summary: Wonderful but pricey
review/text: This stuff is fabulous!  I use it for a pulled pork recipe and it adds a wonderful flavor.  However, there are only a few ounces in the bag, so it only lasts for a few recipes.  I like it, but have a hard time paying $8 for a few cents worth of salt and smokiness. If you're a true foodie, this is great, but I've found I can easily mimic the flavor using plain old kosher salt and some of that Liquid Smoke in a bottle (around $1.50 at your grocery store).

review/summary: Reminds me of grandma's freshly picked apples
review/text: I love the aroma of this tea.  As soon as I open the wrapper, I'm transported back in time to my grandparents' farmhouse, when life was simpler.  In the entryway to the house was a cold room for muddy boots and tools, among other things.  Also, kept there were bushel baskets of apples picked during the harvest season.  Wow! What a memory!  Add the hint of cinnamon and it's a hot winter comfort drink.<br /><br />I will buy it here on Amazon, because I can't currently find it in my local grocery stores.

review/text: This is great tea! I love the aroma and the flavor is wonderful. Apple, cinnamon, and caramel are delicious. One bag does the job in my 12oz travel mug. I love that it is organic and without citric acid (preservative) found in other Tazo teas but I would love it even more if they used unbleached tea bags! Alas then I would have to award it 6 stars!

review/summary: Very good herbal tea
review/text: I have tried a lot of herbal teas over the years, and have been trying even more since I gave up coffee a month ago.  This is one of the best.  I especially like the caramel flavor, that you can smell more than taste.  It adds a really nice touch to the infusion.  I often mix different herbal teas, especially when I'm making iced tea or refrigerator tea, and the apple red, in addition to being great by itself, goes well mixed with other flavors like citrus and berry.

review/summary: Unique taste
review/text: This is my husband's absolute favorite tea. I couldn't find it in any stores. Then there was Amazon.com. It was just fine that the minimum order was 6 boxes of tea. He loves it. Not a great way to test out a new tea though. I would like to be able to buy just 1 box especially if I was not sure I would like the tea.<br /><br />As far as the tea goes, he loves it, I think it's ok. It is a very unique taste and I don't taste as much of the apple or cinnamon. It is heavy on the rubios which is an African bush so not technically a tea in the traditional sense. Still way better than other teas I have tried though just not my favorite. Which is ok since that means more for hubby.
