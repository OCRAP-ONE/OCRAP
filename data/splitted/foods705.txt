review/text: My dog really liked this and she can be a picky eater. She reacted more like it was a treat than regular brkst/dinner so it must be yummy for her. As far as ingredients go its not that much beter than your regular pet food, but not as good as most that you would find at the Vet's office still we will definetly try this from time to time since our dogs likes when we switch it up a bit.

review/summary: My Gigantic Dog Loves Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin
review/text: I have a giant dog.  If he were standing on his hind legs he would tower over me and I'm 6'3" tall.  I don't know how much he weighs but I would suspect it's well over 200 pounds.  He is a Great Dane and he is, in fact, great.  So I imagine that, like me, he probably likes sirloin.  I mean who wouldn't right?  He can consume an entire hamburger in- literally- one bite.  So I supplement his incredible diet of pizza and hamburgers with Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food.  Admittedly a 4.5 pound bag is the equivalent to an afternoon snack for me but, hey, he's worth it.  It's not easy being a dog the size of a small horse so only the best for my beast.

review/summary: Average dog food with tender bits your dog might like
review/text: I have two dogs - a large lab mix who can and will eat anything, and a small dachshund mix who is very picky and would much prefer to eat people food. I have been feeding them Flint River dog food, but the little one is not especially thrilled with it.<br /><br />Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor (made by Purina) is certainly attractive looking. There are irregularly shaped, soft pieces that look like small chunks of meat mixed with smaller, crunchy, green and gold kibble bits. It is not strong smelling. The size of each bit worked well for my smaller and larger dog.<br /><br />Although it looks pretty good to me, my small, picky dog was no more interested in this dog food than the Flint River he usually gets. He ate it, but only after making sure there was nothing better to be had. The larger dog scarfed it down, but then again, she will scarf anything down.<br /><br />Since my lab is elderly and I know nutrition is extremely important, I will be keeping my dogs on the other food because from the ingredients listed on the packaging, it is a higher grade food. (No comparison intended because Flint River is four times the price of Chef Michael's.) However, Chef Michael's seems to me to be an average, middle-of-the-road dog food that is readily available in most stores and has soft bits that many dog's seem to enjoy. I'm just not crazy about all the ingredients, particularly for dogs who have trouble with weight.<br /><br />Here is the nutritional info listed on the package:<br />Crude Protein (min) 28.0%, Crude Fiber (Max) 3.0%, Crude Fat (Min) 16.0%, Moisture (Max) 12.0%<br />Ingredients: Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of vitamin E), brewer's rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite.

review/summary: Meat is the first ingredient
review/text: Chef Michael's has both soft (not necessarily moist, but soft) meat pieces and harder small pieces, so most dogs should be fine, even if they have a difficult time eating standard hard dog food. The product also lives up to its name with meat being the first ingredient.  Chef Michael's was preferred by my beagle over Iams.

review/summary: Dog loved it (but no more than he loves cheaper brands!)
review/text: We're a family that opts for high-quality ingredients in our cooking and eating as humans, so I do like that this dog food is made of high-quality ingredients.<br /><br />But our precious canine family member is, after all, a dog.<br /><br />While we'll prioritize the expense of extra money spent on the higher level of quality for us, our dog thrives on the cheaper stuff, so we'll stick with that.<br /><br />Our dog did love this. But he also eats his own puke as well as the poop from our kids' dirty diapers if he can fish it out of the trash, so I'm not sure that his willingness to eat this says a whole lot.

review/summary: The dogs love it, but no one is loving the after effects!
review/text: I should start by stating that my dogs have never eaten dog food that wasn't organic and made from the same ingredients that humans consume. They digest it well and they are healthy.  I decided to give this dog food a chance because it's inexpensive, and I fell for the slick marketing. I'm not sure what I was thinking!  I thought they might turn their noses up at the new food, but they loved it.  I only gave them a handful each to test it out, and I think they thought they just received a handful of treats!  Many hours later, however, their stomachs started to rumble and they became a little sick.  The low quality ingredients are hard to digest, especially for dogs that are used to human-grade foods  (in other words, they eat REAL food).  I feel guilty for even trying this.  I'll stick with organic dog foods from now on.  They do cost more, but when your dogs are like family, why skimp on something so important?  I recommend Newman's Own dry dog food for a lower cost organic that is still high quality.

review/summary: ok, dog likes it, but.....
review/text: Seems there are four types of dog food.  The first is the bargain brand wal-mart variety.  Benefit-lots of food for less money.  The second type is the garden variety mass produced dog foods.  Brands such as Purina fill this market.  The third is the pseudo-gourmet market again dominated by the major brands with weird names to try to make folks think they are part of group 4 which is gourmet/specialty dog food, those that specialize in high protein, low grain and filler foods.<br /><br />Chef Michaels is an effort in the pseudo-gourmet market.  This stuff was like doggie crack.  As soon as I put it in the bowl, he was attacking the bowl.  so its a good start.  Here's the problem-the gas ran me out of the room.<br /><br />So its a mixed bag.  I think I'll stick with Blue Buffalo

review/text: Not sure how nutritious this food is.. It's not rated very well with the dog food community ingredient wise but my dogs LOVED IT. I mixed it in with their normal Kirkland brand food and it made them eat their normal food with little bits of this food like it was the best thing they have had in their lives.. The dogs felt like it was treats, versus food it smelled and tasted good for them..<br /><br />I wouldn't feed this on a normal basis due to the ingredients ( even though beef is first ), but for a dog that needs help eating, a treaty meal or stimulating appetite this might be a good food enhancer.

review/summary: A Great Pre-packaged Dry Grilled Sirloin
review/text: THOR (the dog) liked this one, with no problem.  It met all our needs for a store-bought dry dog food that is handy and convenient to use.  Yes, I agree with some of the other reviewers, that this would (of course!) not be a fully-desired complete nutritional program, over time, but that kind of attention and augmentation to diet is one of the responsibilities of the pet owner, anyway.  That is called "loving attention."<br /><br />We are glad to have the security of the vitamins and minerals that are included.  At under 5 pounds per bag, it is easy to pack and convenient to take along, especially for camping trips or temporary stop-overs, where planning and convenience trump freshness, temporarily.  Recommended.

review/summary: tasty to the dogs but not cheap
review/text: Well, three out of the three dogs who tried this brand did really seem to enjoy it, and it's easy to see why when meat is the first ingredient listed (as advertised).  There seems to be a good amount of protein to Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry, which the dogs enjoy, and some nice veggie flavoring, but I'd probably consider this more a treat than an every day meal unless you have a small dog and can stretch a 4.5 pound bag to last a while - it's not quite the value as some other brands out there, even if the dogs do enjoy it.

review/summary: Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin
review/text: I've had dogs since I was a kid, and we've fed them everything from cat food to dog food to people food.  Dogs aren't that particular (do you know how much it costs to make 'steak' treats look like steak?  The dogs don't care what it looks like!) but clearly there are some foods they prefer.  Chef Michael (whoever he is) knows how to serve 'em up.  My dog chowed down on this and finished his bowl during our dinner. He NEVER does that...he'd rather beg for food (which we usually don't give him) than stick with what he already has.  Not this time.  He eats it down to the bowl whenever we refill it...that's some serious appreciation for a dog food, one I've never seen before.<br /><br />The bag say that real beef is the number 1 ingredient.  I say it doesn't matter...the dog loves it and, as near as I can tell, its nutritious (mostly) and will keep.  There may be soy and corn in it, but those are fillers.  They aren't unhealthy, they just don't add a lot of food to the food.  It might matter more if the dog was a puppy, but the bag clearly identifies that it is for an adult dog. Last, about the ingredients, if it is beef, I also don't know that there's THAT much nutrition for a dog.  There's protein and that's good...I will keep serving him this.

review/text: I'm a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FVTQJQ">Purina Beneful Healthy Weight, 7-Pounds</a> user and my beagle loves it. When I saw this premium looking dog food I decided to try it out and give my dog a treat. The problem is that she wouldn't eat it. And looking at it I can see why (check my pic above.)<br /><br />This food is gross looking and smelling. My dog sniffed it for a second but wouldn't go after it. I left it out for her during the day and over night and she never touched it.<br /><br />Some dogs may go for it so I can't say it's a bad product. But I can say that it was a bad product for me and my pet. I don't recommend it.<br /><br />NOTE: I'll be giving this away to a family member for her daschunds and I'll update it if they liked it to be fair.

review/text: Emmy is somewhat picky but tore into this dog food.  It is obvious that she enjoys the taste of the food and it appears to have no ill effects on her digestive track at all.  Obviously a five in her book.  As for why I give it a four - the ingredients list does hold a number of less than healthy items.

review/text: This is fancy-schmanzy gourmet dog food by Purina, with similar sort of ingredients to other Purina products, but the dogs certainly gathered around when I served it! It wouldn't be ideal for a dog with certain sensitivities (check the ingredient list before purchasing), and it's probably a little rich for my two who are both getting pudgy, but for an occasional treat, or for younger and more active dogs, it is just fine. There is the convenience of dry food, too; I'm not much for messy canned food. Once my pudgy puppies slim down, they can have it more often.

review/summary: The dogs give it five stars!
review/text: I figured that a dog food made with beef and Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor would smell really good to a dog, but I did a little test.  I put one dog's regular food in a paper bowl and the new food in another paper bowl--so that the bowls wouldn't interfere with the test.  Then I put the old food on the floor in its regular place, and I put the new food further away.  The dog smelled her regular food first, and then she started sniffing all over in the air until she tracked down the new food.  She gobbled that up and then ate her regular food.  The next time I put the new food further away--behind the dog food storge container--and she tracked it down and ate it first again before eating her regular food.  (I divided the food half and half so it would be her regular amount.)<br /><br />"Real Beef is our #1 ingredient" it says on the bag.  In the list of ingredients that is followed by soybean meal, soy flour and lots of additives, including the dyes and corn products, etc., plus 23 essential vitamins and minerals.  Green beans and potatoes are listed as garnishes.  There are crunchy kibbles and tender pieces, which I'm assuming is the beef.  It's for adult dogs, and the product is now made by the Nestle Purina Pet Care Company.  A company in Switzerland owns the trademarks.  (I trusted Purina.)<br /><br />The instructions say to gradually mix the old regular food with the new, which I always do--except for the two tests.  Btw, while studying the information on the bag and making notes at the dining room table, the dogs were all over me.  One wanted to climb up on the table via my lap; fortunately he's short.  (He picked the beef pieces out of his regular food earlier; it was mixed together.)

review/text: MY dog actually liked this dry food, which is surprising because he never likes dry dog food...So clearly the makers of this product got the taste right with this. But this is definitely not something you want to feed your dog daily as it is substandard when it comes to nutritional value. BUT , I can see myself giving this a  couple times a week as a break for sure though.<br />Overall, if your like me, with a picky dog when it comes to dry dog food, give this a try. I dont recommend giving this daily, but it could be a nice complement to your dogs regular food (if your dog likes it!).

review/text: Chef Michael's dog food does contain beef as it's first ingredient which makes it a good choice compared to other grocery store options if you can't afford the high end stuff at pet stores. Both my dogs loved it but (full disclosure) they aren't fussy at all. I suggest you do what I do if you can't afford high-end dog food. Mix the better grocery store dog food choices like Chef Michael's with dog vitamins, fish oil, and a mixture of chicken or beef and eggs, maybe throw in some sweet potatoes and spinach, some brown rice. It punches up their food with more of what they need and is more affordable than expensive pet store food and freezes well. Plus some of that pet store food isn't all its cracked up to be.

review/summary: The Dogs Give This A Paws Up
review/text: I hate to admit it, but I actually taste new dry dog food brands before giving any to my pooches.  You wouldn't believe how awful some dog food really is.  I knew Chef Michael's was a winner from the get-go.  The dogs just love it, and I feel good knowing it's loaded with vitamins/minerals, and the primary ingredient is either beef (grilled sirloin flavor) or chicken (oven roasted chicken).  Unlike some dog food, Chef Michael's isn't overly-sweet or heavily laden with corn.  My older dog is finicky and has a little trouble chewing, but she can easily (and readily) eat this.  It's a blend of soft pieces and smaller kibble.  Mixing with a little water helps even more.<br /><br />My one complaint is expense.  Dog food prices, particularly better quality brands, have skyrocketed.  I refuse to buy junk, so must take advantage of sales and coupons.  I often wonder what the actual cost to make dog food products really is.  Ten dollars for a 4.5 lb bag of dog food seems extravagant.

It looks like it too, what you see on the outside of the bad is exactly what you get on the inside, big chunky pieces of beef that your dog will go crazy over. Even my cat stopped eating her food and tried to sneak a nibble of this she was so enticed. With 23 extra vitamins this is an excellent choice for a healthy adult dog. I would highly recommend this to any dog lover.

We have found we cannot let them free-graze with this food; they will eat until they are sick.  We have decided to use this food for training treats as it is too enticing to let them have a bowlful. Plus with two dogs, one will get left out, depending upon which one gets to the food first.

review/text: My dog **loved** this food. As soon as she smelled it she started barking at me, as I poured it into her bowl. One of my elderly cats even sidled up and tried to steal some of the dog food, and a small food fight erupted momentarily. So for palatability this rates high! I could see this being a successful food for a pet who just normally is not enthusiastic at eating.<br /><br />But let's break it down: the main composition of this dog food? Soy, rice, corn, wheat. If my dog weren't a carnivore, I'd be ok with this. But my dog has allergies, big time, and this food is mostly filler in my opinion. I feed her Blue Buffalo Wilderness (no grain) or else she will develop a bad smell, itch, and have lots of scabs and skin problems.<br /><br />At the end of the day I would recommend this to someone instead of Ol' Roy or some cheap store brand food, but overall I don't like that most of the ingredients are filler grains. I would not feed this unless I absolutely had to. At least I would know that my pets would scarf it down!

review/summary: He actually spit it out!
review/text: I thought for sure that our dog was going to inhale this food.  He will pretty much gobble up just about anything you put in front of him so I fully expected Chef Michael's Gilled Sirloin to be a hit with him especially after seeing so many reviews saying that their dog loved this food.  I was shocked when I gave it to our dog and after chewing the first bite he actually spit it out.  I tried getting him to eat more of it but he wasn't having it.  I guess there is something out there that he won't eat.

review/summary: My dogs LOVE the little bits of steak
review/text: My little 1.5 lbs yorkie mix loves these tiny bites.  I will sit down with her and pull the little steak bits out and throw them to her.  She loves to jump and chase them.  She also seems to be pretty happy with the harder kibble bits, although she doesn't chase those, so they must be less appealing.  Normally she is a very finicky eater, but really likes this food.  She also has had no digestive issues with it at all.<br /><br />My 20lbs mongrel sweetheart dog loves this too.  She isn't a picky eater, but the wrong food makes picking up after her in the park a nightmare.  I allowed her to try this anyway and have had no digestive issues at all.  She also seems to think the chewy steak bits are super treats.<br /><br />I will definitely repurchase this food.  The price on Amazon at this point is about $2 cheaper than my local grocery store.

review/summary: So-So Food for Dogs
review/text: It is very hard to tempt my dog with dry food, and this product proved NOT to be the exception. An almost life-long eater of moist food, my 10 year old Doxie - mix will eat a few bites if it is included with her canned food. Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food did prove to be a hit with cats, but not as much as did the Beneful Dry that we tried earlier this summer. The number one ingredient in this product is beef, while corn gluten, which seems to be a hot button issue for many, comes in seventh. All pet food sold in the United States meets the minimum nutritional standards for dogs and cats. Now, one can decide that just meeting the minimum is not acceptable and choose to purchase a more expensive brand from a vet or a speciality store, but for some price is a consideration as well. If my dog liked this brand I would buy it, but she seems determined to keep me purchasing wet food for her.

review/summary: Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food 4.5 Pound Bag...
review/text: The doggies (Nena, Samantha and Spike) love this dog food - and that's saying something.  Chef Michael's come up with a great product here.  The only problem:  The bag is too small (but, perhaps that's the point?).  Purchase a bag in your local grocery and try it out.  I think you'll be pleased.<br /><br />At my local Ralph's grocery, the bag retails for $11.99 (relatively expensive, but it is a great dog food - the dogs actually eat their bowls clean!)<br /><br />I rate "Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food (4.5 Pound Bag)"...Five stars!<br /><br />Recommended!

review/text: My two dogs, a chiweiner and a chowrot, loved me very much the day I brought this home. They have been fed the same dog food all of their lives and couldn't wait to dig into this one. They left their regular food alone. I don't know what is so special but the first ingredient is beef so that seems alright. I really know how else to rate it as I don't eat it but my dogs gave it five paws up.

review/summary: If you don't mind a gassy dog afterwards....
review/text: In a nutshell -- the dogs (both under 20 lbs)in(2) separate households tried this product and they scoffed it down without a morsel left in the bowl, but unlike cats these dogs are not terribly fussy.<br /><br />It does look appealing, but when reading the top ingredients, and considering the price, it doesn't seem to be a wise or an economical food for the dogs.<br /><br />But the number one reason is, both dogs became very gassy (I'm guessing from large amounts of soy). Honestly, this is not something pet owners want to have to deal with on a regular basis.<br /><br />Not recommended.

review/summary: Finicky Dogs (& Cat) Love This Dogfood!
review/text: My dogs are finicky about what they eat.  Basically, one of my dogs doesn't care for any brand of dog food and only eats it when he's famished.  We've tried the expensive stuff (Eukanuba & Blue) and the cheap stuff (Purina & other brands) and he hates them all equally.<br /><br />The most notable thing about Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food is it's appearance.  It really does look like petrified pieces of beef, and you can see the vegetables in it.  Also, the number one ingredient is beef, which is unusual.  Even the high-end brands mentioned above do not have meat products as their main ingredient, but have corn listed first.<br /><br />Taste test on this product was a success; both my dogs ate it.  And my cat, who only eats meat products, had a few bites too, which is a verification of the meat content, in my opinion.<br /><br />The cost is not prohibitive, especially considering the prime shipping.<br /><br />Will I buy it?  Probably.  I have to wait to make sure my finicky dogs continues eating it until the last morsel is gone.  I've been fooled before.

review/summary: Meaty, happy with beef content; still contains corn
review/text: I'm very happy with beef being the top ingredient in this very nice dog food; meat SHOULD be the top ingredient in a dog's diet. I am happy with the soy products, rice, poultry products, fats, wheat and barley. Those are relatively wholesome foods, and - my guess is - delicious. My dog loves the soft meaty chunks and happily wolfs down the kibble pieces too.<br /><br />Corn is still high in the list, however, as the seventh and eight  ingredient. Corn is a cheap filler, so I understand its common appearance in dog food. Unfortunately, dogs do not digest corn well, and many canines have corn allergies. I would have preferred more of the dried green beans and potatoes, which are lower on the list.<br /><br />I don't really know how to rank this - do I remove a star for adding cheap, indigestible corn? Do I give Purina five stars for what seems to be a sincere attempt at a high-end, beefy, nutritious product?<br /><br />Looking at the list again, I am curious about the high salt content. Do dogs need salt to flavor their food, or is the salt included as a somewhat natural preservative? I'm also concerned that Purina consistently feels a need to include food coloring in dog feed. Color can only possible be for the benefit of the people serving the product, which is a bit mystifying. I assume people aren't eating this. :)<br /><br />So. This is a pet product containing mostly beef and other nutritious options in the end. It just needs to be tweaked with a few omissions of questionable ingredients. A resealable bag would be a nice bonus.<br /><br />If this was marketed as a mid-line feed, I would certainly not hesitate to award five stars for what it is. Since this particular brand is touted as a high-end, discerning palate-type kibble, I'll stick with four stars for now. Kudos to Purina for trying and I hope they keep working at it. :)

review/summary: paws down, the winner
review/text: How do you review a dog food that you aren't even going to taste yourself?  Being scientifically accurate, I brought four dogs to the (figurative) table:  two Rat Terriers (Riley and Hawk), a Doberman (Halle), and a Brown Lab (Polo).<br /><br />For testing purposes, I (really, I did!) set out four bowls.  My idea was to let each of them take a choice of the four:  Beneful by Purina, Chef Michael's (this product), Kirkland Lamb & Rice (their regular food), and strangely enough, dry cat food which seems to be a hit with all of them (they obsess over it).<br /><br />Each dog had a turn.  I'm not sure if it was the look of it, because it looks like a real pot roast dinner, but this product got woofed down the fastest.  They didn't even look at the others.  I don't think dogs see in color, so am convinced it wasn't the colorful kibbles.  My testing problem was that trying to take each dog away and put them aside to let the other dogs have a turn at the taste test was fraught with danger. They did NOT want to give it up.  The Kirkland and the Beneful didn't warrant any interest, even when Chef Michael's was gone and those were the only options.  Even the cat food that they usually go for (probably just to get on the cat's nerves) sat unnibbled.<br /><br />So, easy to say, this was a hit.  Small dog and big, none had trouble with the size of the food.  It sort of looks like Chunky Stew without the liquid.  Also, a side bonus was that the gassy little rat terriers didn't seem so gassy after....although, this bag only allowed them four dinners between the four dogs.  Now that it's gone, they are sad.<br /><br />If I could afford this regularly, I would purchase it.  There was no waste, nothing for the blue jays to hit on the next day.  And an unexpected treat is that when you order dog food online, if it's Prime shipping it shows up quick and shipped free...so no lugging it from the store.  I like that convenience of that, and plan on putting dog food on a subscription plan on Amazon so that I don't have to run out when when we frequently run out.  Plus, I get tired of running to Costco for what I'm told is quality food.

review/text: Of course my dog loved this food.  There have been very few that she hasn't liked.  She didn't go as crazy about it as she has with other formulas I've tested and reviewed.  I feel though that, while this food is visually colorful and appealing, it is because of artificial colors and flavors.  If this was the only bag of food on the shelf, I would buy it.  Otherwise, I prefer feeding her Iams Sensitive Naturals Ocean Fish, Rice and Barley Recipe.

Even our difficult child the bassett hound, did not play her usual dinner time games and just chowed down! They seemed to like to moist kibble the most, but their bowls were cleaned up.<br /><br />Update: My difficult child the bassett ran to her bowl and sat down in anticipation for another meal of Chef Michaels, when her regular chow appeared she turn and gave us the nastiest look and walk away.

review/summary: You're dogs will love it, owners will love it for the price but it may not be the healthiest...
review/text: When it comes to dog food, as you can see with the many reviews on Purina Chef Michael's products, you have passionate pet owners who are concerned about their dogs health and feeding them the best food possible.<br /><br />I admire pet owners who can do just that, as I know many who prefer to cook their dogs meal to those who will splurge in order to make sure their dogs eat the best and are healthy.  But with today's economy, I also know that there are owners who can't cook, can't splurge and try to look for the best price that they can to feed their dog(s).<br /><br />Purina's Chef Michels brand sounds like gourmet food for the dogs.  But looking at the price, how can gourmet food be so cheap?  Well, for the Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor dog food which comes with potato & green bean garnishes, there is no doubt that many dogs will eat it.<br /><br />Ingredients are: Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, salt, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, natural filet mignon flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and other color), sulfur, zinc sulfate, Vitamin E supplement, ferrous sulfate and many more.<br /><br />My small adult Pug-tzu's love eating this dry dog food.  It's small and at first they sniffed it but after 10 minutes or so, they began scarfing it down.  I did mix it with other dog food but on its own, I'm sure they enjoy it.  And what I like about it is that Amazon offers it for under $10, Purina does say they use real beef and the crunchy kibbles includes 23 essential vitamins and minerals.  Granted, after eating this, they also tend to have more stools.  I also want to note that my dogs did not produce any horrid flatulence after eating this dog food, like others have reported.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I'm not an erudite when it comes to what is healthy for dogs and what isn't.  There are many reviews from hardcore dog lovers that you can read on this product to know that many have chimed in and called this "junk food" for their dogs.<br /><br />But I also feel that there are many people out there who are dog owners who can't afford to pay so much for their dog's food and the price of this dry dog food is quite appealing.  Purina does claim this particular Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dry dog food does include 23 essential vitamins and nutrients.<br /><br />So, for the pet owners who are very budget-conscious, are looking for dry dog food that their small dogs will enjoy but also getting the essential vitamins in their meal, then Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog food may be for you.

review/summary: Junk Food for Dogs
review/text: I use Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food almost as an occasional - and small - treat for my 10-lbs dog, but don't consider it to be good nutrition wise for every day food. Nutrition aside, for small dogs, these pieces are way too large so for that reason alone, I would not recommend this food for small breeds. I give my dog 1 piece and it keeps him occupied with chewing for a good 20 minutes.<br /><br />As far as ingredients go, yes, the first ingredient is in fact beef. However, everything that follows is a junky filler - soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat, rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, etc. Hasn't Purina (the maker of this dog food) heard that soy can be terrible for dog's stomachs? I haven't seen any Purina brands that provide good nutrition for dogs, and this one is no exception.

review/text: My mini-Aussie loves this dog food.  Unfortunately, she loves it so much she gobbles it up faster than she does her regular food.  Then she gets hungry faster and wants to eat again.  This is a problem since she's overweight and we're trying to limit her food intake.  I've begun mixing Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin with her regular food to keep her from overeating.<br /><br />When we first received it, my 8 yo and 11 yo sons thought it looked so good, they each tasted a piece of the dried steak.  They informed me that it tastes like beef jerky. No wonder my dog likes it.  Thankfully, my sons haven't kept eating out of the dog bowl.

review/summary: Our Dogs Ate it Fine
review/text: Our dogs' diet is largely people food as my brother spends his day cooking.  However, we always put out a bowl of good dry dog food for them when they aren't interested in our meals (been on a low red meat quick lately to keep the cholesterol under control).<br /><br />Although the ingredients aren't quite as good as the premium brand I've been giving them, I certainly don't consider it poison as some reviewers have stated. If soybeans are good enough for menopausal women, why would you think it's going to harm your dog?  It might cause bloating but it won't kill them.<br /><br />So I give it a three as adequate and the dogs seemed to enjoy it.

review/summary: Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food
review/text: I gave this to my friends 2 little chihuahuas (sp) and they loved it. They didn't eat as much at one time as they do cheaper brands of food which leads me to believe it is more filling and more satisfying. That also means less poo to get rid of later off the yard when I am taking care of them. The sirloin bits that are soft tend to stick together so if your giving it to a tiny dog then I suggest you pull those chunks apart a bit so they don't get them caught in their throat if they eat too fast. I noticed they sniffed it out and ate all the sirloin chunks first, then ate the rest. They definitely enjoy it and when they see this bag they come running. I do wish the bag ahd been resealable for freshness though. I dumped it all in a huge tupperware so it would stay fresh.

review/summary: Dogs love it...
review/text: I'm in agreement with the various top reviews for this product, dogs love it, but humans don't. Look at it this way, any product containing only high quality beef is going to cost a lot more than this price and is anyone buying this going to expect 100% beef inside? I partly blame manufacturers for this, they advertise dog food with vegetables on TV. Do we really expect our dogs (carnivores) to be eating steak, mash potatoes and a side of veggies? It seems consumers buy into it and so are also partly to blame for buying them and causing the manufacturers to making and selling more.<br /><br />Anyway, without taking any of the above into consideration my comments on this are:<br />1. Has a good variety of colors and shapes<br />2. We mixed it with other dog food and my dog ate all of the Chef Michael's only!<br />3. Her stool seems to be more than before (more indigestible ingredients?)<br />4. The zip lock bag is good<br /><br />So as far as my dog's opinion goes, she loves it so a 5 star from her!

True, they swallowed it right down, but the gas and diarrhea that followed was horrendous.

review/summary: He likes it so well we may wind up with a plump pup!
review/text: Our dog has tried near every dog food on the market.  We started him off on one of the premium brands, purchased at our Vet's office.  While that one was balanced nutritionally, he did not particularly like it, and it gave him gas (a noted problem, according to our vet).  Now that he is grown, I have been less concerned about precise balance of nutrients, though I do look for quality ingredients.<br />  With Chef Michael's, you get both nutritional balance and high qual8ity ingredients.  It is one of the very few dog foods which lists meat (in this case beef) as the first ingredient.  It also has grains, vegetables, and vitamins.  He doesn't much care about all of that.  he clearly likes the taste.  yesterday I accidentally gave him half again as much as he usually gets because I tipped the bag too far, and in a very short time it was gone and he was looking for more.<br /><br />  I like that it is packaged in plastic, which preserves it better in our humid environment, and the small bags make it easier to handle.  The one and only downside is the cost, near double what other Purina dog foods sell for.  I also love Amazon delivery, as my biggest challenge has been getting my teen to come to 5the market with me to heft 20+ pound bags of dog food (we have a Big dog :)<br /><br />  In the past we have rotated through several brands to make sure he was getting variety and a balanced diet.  I think I will be adding this one to the rotation.  He very clearly likes it.  It provides a good balance in terms of nutrition, has quality ingredients, and the size and packaging keep it fresh until lit is gone (not very long ;)

review/summary: Dogs loved but leaves this weird greasy residue
review/text: The dogs literally licked their bowls when they finished with this however the weird greasy feeling that got on my hands from reaching in the bag leaves me wondering how "good" this can be for the dogs. The other thing that bothered me is the smell from it, I have never had such a strong smelling food, for the 1st time I have to keep the lid tight on the food container and it in the garage as the dogs tried to open the cabinet we keep it in... Its an odd smell too, and we have tried all different great brands. This is something I am not sure I would buy on my own seeing as my concerns about it but I know the dogs love it!!

review/summary: Dog loves it!
review/text: While I'll admit the food smelled strange when I opened the bag, my dog does love this product. It's a little crunchier than her regular food and I like that because I feel it helps clean her teeth instead of something that's easy to chew. If the dog likes it then it's a product that I'll enjoy giving her, and trust me, there are some foods that she sticks her nose up at and refuses to eat. This was not one of them.

review/text: My  three dogs went crazy for this food, even the chihuahua. It has a crunchy blend of filet mignon garnished with potatoes and green beans not too bad for dogs, I wouldn't mind having this every day for dinner.  It doesn't look like typical dry food.

review/summary: If I was a dog I'd want to eat this, not a good thing though...
review/text: I have 2 chihuahuas.  One is aged 12 and the other is aged 4.  Both of them really enjoy this food but it doesn't agree that well with either of their stomachs.  It seems to give both of them really loose stool which makes them need to go potty more often than they should.<br /><br />The food itself looks incredible.  If I were a dog I'd be thrilled to be given this food.  The big meaty pieces are nice and tender which is good for my 12-year-old chihuahua who only has 2/3 of her teeth left.  This is very easy for her to chew.<br /><br />Although they seem to love it and it looks so well, it may not be the best option nutrition-wise or for their stomachs.  I think it's best for us to just mix some of this in with their other food so that this is not all they're eating.

review/summary: I'm going to clarify, potatoes in dog food....
review/text: The nutritional profile has already been discussed to death here from what I see so I'm going to address a concern that we had regarding the addition of potatoes to this blend.<br /><br />We had always heard to  NEVER give your dog potatoes so when I saw it listed as an ingredient I was very surprised so I did what everyone in this cyber age does... I googled it!<br /><br />The best explanation I've found is on the ASPCA website, to summarize it, they say that the ripe potatoes aren't considered poisonous, it's the green parts of the plant or a green potato.<br /><br />A potato (& tomato for that matter) is a member of the nightshade plant family.<br /><br />It contains solanine which if eaten in large amounts produces drooling, upset tummy (including diarrhea & even vomiting), weakness, loss of appetite, sleepiness, confusion, personality/behavior changes, dilated pupils & slowed heart rate...<br /><br />So while a LITTLE bit of ripe potato occasionally shouldn't be a problem for a dog be sure they do not eat any GREEN parts of a potato or a living potato plant.<br /><br />Wow, who knew!<br /><br />In this modern day & age of mechanization I'm sure that an occasional "greenish" potato or 2 gets into the mixture, so with having a VERY small Yorkie that only weighs 2 pounds (who BTW LOVES the way this tastes & will eat way more of it than he does of his regular food the little piggy!) I'm not going to take a chance on him having a reaction to a possible green chunk of potato!  So I'm just mixing this bag into our Labradoodle's food to dilute the ratio of potato he is exposed to as opposed to her eating this straight as it comes right out of the bag to use it up.<br /><br />Even though they both love it I will not be reordering it.

review/summary: What's your definition of "good"?
review/text: As any human on a diet (or simply trying to eat healthy) can tell you, good tasting and good for you are not necessarily the same thing.  Personally, if I could get away with it, I might eat nothing but ice cream with chocolate syrup.  Unfortunately, ice cream does a number on my stomach, and you don't want to be around me a few hours afterward.  Which is not to say I don't occasionally indulge.<br /><br />This dog food is sort of like that for dogs.  My dog, a thirteen-year-old German Shepherd mix who has been spoiled with canned food most of his life and usually won't touch dry food, scarfed this up in seconds flat.  I'm pretty sure if I'd have let him at it, he would have eaten the entire bag in one sitting (I understand, Callahan, I've been there).  I was pretty excited and all set to rate this a five star dog food.<br /><br />But then, a few hours later, lordy, the smell was enough to knock me out of bed!  Callahan was eager to go outside where, after relieving himself, he spent the rest of the night eating grass, which is what he does when his tummy isn't happy.  But apparently, like me with ice cream, the after effects apparently weren't bad enough to make him stop eating it.  When I offered him some more a week later, he was happy to indulge (with similar results).<br /><br />Other reviewers have compared this to candy for dogs, which is pretty much how I'm treating it.  It may not be good for him, but he loves it and once a week or so isn't going to hurt him.  Yes, the ingredients are all bad for dogs, but then, have you looked at the ingredients in most ice cream brands lately?  If you're concerned about only giving your dog healthy food, I'd pass on this.  But my dog is old and probably won't be around that much longer.  If this food makes him happy (and it does), then I don't see a reason why he can't die happy.

review/summary: He loves it, but I don't
review/text: While I usually feed my dog, a Border Collie/English shepherd rescue, the best food possible, I figured I'd give this a whirl. He loved it! Granted, what I don't love is the ingredient list. Things like soy, corn meal and animal fat are not something I intend to feed my dog to keep him in the best health... so it's not something I would buy all the time for his food source. I've been giving it to him as a treat, a few times a week just to keep things interesting. The beef and vegetables are good, but there's too many other things in it that would keep me from feeding it to him on a daily basis.

review/summary: It is simply put dog crack
review/text: This stuff lasted about 20 seconds in the bowl once I put it in.  The dogs loved it and I can recommend it on that alone.  As long as the dogs eat it and dont starve to death what is inside the thing doesnt bother me to much.  They are dogs, they eat poop.  They dont care what you put in front of them, they will eat it.  I have dogs of all size and my little one was able to eat it as soon as she snuck under my big dog.  The pieces are easy enough to chew as I did try, and my teeth are no where as good as theirs, and it seems to digest easily as I havent had any episodes since eating them.  Regardless, I can say this stuff is good enough for me and them.  If you have a dainty dog you might want to try something else, I have junkyard dogs and they will eat anything.

review/summary: All three of my dogs like the food
review/text: We have 3 large dogs, two labs and a German Shepard-Chow mix. All of the range widely in ages and finickiness with foods. One dog will eat anything in sight, but many things give her gas. Another is picky and gets quite ill of off several different kinds of dog foods. The third dog is sort of in between, will eat most all dog foods, but has never had stomach issues with any of them. I gradually mixed in a little of this food at a time with their usual dog food <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I">PURINA Beneful</a>. Then slowly got them till they were eating just this Chef Michael's. All three dogs seemed to enjoy the food and the dog who often gets ill from new dog foods, did not with this one. However our youngest, who will eat anything in sight, did get a little gassy with the food. But it's not uncommon for her to get gassy with her regular food as well. The dogs all enjoy it and seem to have no real problems eating it, anymore than they to their regular Beneful dog food.

review/summary: Dog Tentatively approved of taste but upset stomach
review/text: Taste Test: I expected this to be a big hit with the dog but in fact, he seemed rather cavalier about it...somewhat more excited than a bowl of plain dry kibble but less than his canned food which makes sense given the fact that this is a moist type kibble product.<br /><br />Tummy Test: We have special needs dogs so always introduce new foods slowly and carefully however, after several days of feeding, this seemed to upset the stomach of one dog. Now, to be fair, he tends to have a delicate stomach and is prone to upset but after reviewing the ingredient list, I think it is probably the soy. It was the only thing immediately different. Frankly, giving a dog soy doesn't make a lot of sense to me...it seems like a far inferior protein source for a dog who is clearly not vegan but a carnivore to begin with.<br /><br />Price Test: Given the price per pound and the stomach upset, I would not be likely to buy this product again. It may be acceptable for a pet less prone to stomach upset but it makes me wonder over the wisdom of the soy.

review/summary: My picky dog will eat this
review/text: We have been Iams and Science Diet fans for the four years of our dog's life, but decided to give this a try when he started being finicky about flavors. He cleans the bowl in about 10 seconds. Our other tiny dog also likes this as much as the super expensive stuff made for "royalty." Neither had stomach issues with the change over and they will work for it like a treat. If you are looking for something a notch up form junk dog food, but priced reasonably give the Chef Michael's a try. It even smells good to us!

review/summary: Pups are enjoying this
review/text: The chunks in this packaged dog food look like hunks of beef and freeze dried peas and carrots.  It's a bit chewy but they really love it.  As soon as I opened the bag, they were interested - sniffing around it before I filled their bowls and then they wolfed it down and stood begging for more.  We've been using a different brand for years but this may be a new one that we buy to have as a treat.<br />The kibble really does look tasty out of the bag like chunks of real grilled meat.  Chef Michael knows how to cook for pups.  It will be something I'll recommend to friends with dogs and will continue to use myself.  Thanks, Chef Michael or should I say "Woof, woof" which is what my dogs would say.

review/summary: It looks appealing - to humans - but is it any better than the others?
review/text: Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food is a `gourmet' offering from Purina.  It's a tasty dinner (or so my Aussie Fred says) with tender meaty chunks, and it smells like beef.  Fred's happy with Chef M.  But then Fred is also happy with his usual Science Diet ProActive Health Adult Dog MiniChunks.<br /><br />And Fred's Mama?  I'm happy that Fred likes to eat, but I want a dog food company that tells me EXACTLY where the ingredients in my dog's dinner come from.  Both Purina and Iams don't list country of origin with the reasoning that it varies.  But we all know why I'm concerned.<br /><br />I want Fred to enjoy his dinner, eat all his dinner, get a well-balanced diet and be safe with what he eats.<br /><br />Most major dog foods supply a well-balanced diet.  Chef Michael is no exception.  The listed ingredients are Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, salt, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, natural filet mignon flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and other color), sulfur, zinc sulfate, Vitamin E supplement, ferrous sulfate, choline chlo.<br /><br />His usual Iams contains Chicken, Corn Meal, Ground Whole Grain Sorghum, Chicken By-Product Meal, Dried Beet Pulp, Chicken Flavor, Chicken Fat (Preserved With Mixed Tocopherols, A Source Of Vitamin E), Dried Egg Product, Brewers Dried Yeast, Potassium Chloride, Salt, Caramel, Calcium Carbonate, Flax Meal, Fructooligosaccharides, Minerals (Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Oxide, Manganese Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Manganous Oxide, Potassium Iodide, Cobalt Carbonate), Vitamins (Vitamin E Supplement, Ascorbic Acid, Vitamin A Acetate, Calcium Pantothenate, Biotin, Thiamine Mononitrate (Source Of Vitamin B1), Vitamin B12 Supplement, Niacin, Riboflavin Supplement (Source Of Vitamin B2), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Source Of Vitamin B6), Inositol, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Folic Acid), Choline Chloride, L-Lysine Monohydrochloride, Dl-Methionine, Rosemary Extract.<br /><br />My degree isn't in animal nutrition, so all I can glean from this is that one has more beef and one more chicken.  Since as far I as I know beef isn't more nutritious than chicken, I assume that as long as Fred likes the taste there's not much different there.  The rest of the list I find equally confusing.<br /><br />The Chef Michael's is designed to look good to humans and smell good to dogs.  At the moment it's fourteen cents an ounce; the Iams is nine cents.  The effect on Fred will be pretty much the same - both offer the nutrition he needs.

review/summary: Gobble It Up
review/text: I won't dispute the fact that Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin is somewhat expensive and may not be the healthiest choice in dry dog food, but there is no denying the fact that dogs love it. Heck, I have 2 cats and even they enjoy snacking on it when the dog isn't around. Perhaps it isn't ideal nutrition, but I don't think it is as bad as some other reviewers have made it out to be. In any event, this is more of a treat food than a diet staple, and when viewed in that light, it is actually healthier and much more cost effective than many of those little packages of doggie treats that line the grocery store shelves.<br /><br />Place a serving of this next to a bowl of "healthy" store brand dog food and there is no comparison. Aesthetically it looks better, but I know that isn't what dogs care about. The bowl of Chef Michael's food will be eaten first every time. My suggestion is to either mix it in with your regular dry food, or use it as a treat. If you are overly concerned by the ingredients in your pet's food, then you may find issue with this brand. Also, there is no "zip-lock" to re-seal it so you'll need a large, strong clip to keep the bag closed. Or you can use an large plastic container like I do. Otherwise, this pet food gets two paws up!

review/text: Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food 4.5 Pound Bag<br /><br />What a dog I got, his favorite bone is in my arm. --Rodney Dangerfield  :)<br /><br />*reads label* "A delightful crunchy blend of filet mignon garnished with potatoes and green beans. This delectable dish is full of meaty goodness that will make your dog's mouth water. Nothing delights your dog like the ultimate steak flavor."  Okay, into my Shopping Cart it goes. :)<br /><br />As I am not about to taste the food ( myself ), My dogs ( Rottweilers ) will tell me the rest:<br /><br />Opened up Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food, and let my Guys have an initial sniff. (I've learned this is very important -- if mine just sit there, they will probably not eat it).  Their eyes really lit up and you could tell they were getting excited about trying something new and different.<br /><br />The dog food does have a nice variety of earthy colors and shapes - to stimulate their minds - , and has a very pleasant aroma.  Nothing annoying to the senses, as far as I could tell.  It is a mix of hard and semi-soft foods.<br /><br />They waited for the "cue" to eat, and then dove in and woofed all the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food down, then hunted around the bowl for any possible spilled nuggets.  I knew it was a hit when they sat up and begged for more. Bravo!  *claps hands*<br /><br />Guess they love it, and Purina is a brand I can trust! 'nuf said!<br /><br />Purina does not include a handy zip lock with this particular bag (unless I inadvertently cut it off when using the sissors to open the bag) -- which would have been a "plus", if ya know what I mean.  So, I had to hunt around for one of those gigantic potato chip bag clips. But, that's not a biggie, as the bag is only a 4.5 pounder and will probably be eaten a lot sooner than a gigantic bag of the same food.<br /><br />Does Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food sound like what you may be looking for in a dog food? :) I'm off to buy more, as this 4.5 pound bag will not last long, if ya know what I mean!  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012

review/text: I will admit that I am not the one who looks at the ingredient lists.  My dogs receive plenty of exercise and have always gotten the thumbs up from our vet.  So I tend to buy what my dogs will eat instead.<br /><br />When this arrived, I refilled the dogs dishes with it and they couldn't get it down fast enough!  They loved it!  I think they enjoyed this better than their previous dog food.  It even looks better than some of the other dog foods I have given them in the past.<br /><br />If you aren't a stickler for ingredients, then this would make a good choice for already healthy dogs.  Mine enjoyed it and are currently on their last bowl of it.<br /><br />The one thing that I don't like about it is the price.  It is a little high for the package size and other brands will give you more for the same price.

review/summary: Both of my dogs love it
review/text: This bagged dry dog food "presents" very nicely . . . no disagreeable dog food odor, visible chewy meat and vegetable nuggets, and apparently an excellent taste that dogs enjoy.<br /><br />We normally feed our Jack Russell and Chihuahua using a feeder that allows them access to food 24/7.  However, with this Chef Michael's Grilled Siroin Dry Dog Food, I'm forced to ration it out in suitable serving sizes to each dog to prevent overeating (the same routine I would use for table scraps).  Notwithstanding the overfeeding caution, I trust Purina (the maker of Chef Michael's) as a reputable pet food manufacturer and have no concerns with nutritional or health issues here.  Combine that with the apparent great taste and this is a 5 star product in my opinion.<br /><br />If I may add further opinion regarding the quality of this product and the variety of reviewer responses -- I see that many reviewers took issue with the ingredients list, finding most of the ingredients to be inferior, undesirable, or harmful.  I guess I'm a bit more economically frugal in my views.  As this is a relatively expensive dog food, I don't mean frugal price-wise, but rather resource-wise.  OF COURSE by-product meats and some vegetable filler (which does have nutritional benefit) are used.  I find it acceptable and even expected that the meat and fat products used in this DOG FOOD would come from animals that are in-part legally unsuitable for humans  (although in other parts of the world they would be consumed by humans). In fact, nothing in the animal slaughter industry goes to waste and the ingredients in this pet food product are far from the bottom of that usage ladder.  Unacceptable are the synthetic pet food products such as we have imported from China that have actually killed our pets or ruined their kidneys.  Acceptable, in my opinion, are pet foods (such as this Chef Michael's branded product) made by a reputable experienced manufacturer using by-products and vegetable products known as suitable for pets.<br /><br />Anecdotally, I recall growing up on a farm where our Labrador loved to kill and eat groundhogs . . . it sometimes took a few days to finish one . . . in the summer.  Burying didn't help, as she would dig them up.  Anyway,  the dog loved the disgusting decaying groundhogs, which would have violated pet food laws and sensitivities on many fronts.  She lived long and healthy.  And happy.

review/summary: We've been using Chef Michael's for a long time and our satisfaction level is high ...
review/text: Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavored dog food has been my choice of dog food for quite some time.  I used to feed both of my dogs the same food, but when my smaller one developed seizure activity I decided to change.  One of the things I liked about this particular brand is that it doesn't have any "suspect" ingredients such as rosemary extract which have been rumored to exacerbate such activity in small dogs.  No, he has not been cured, but with anti-seizure medication and a food sans "natural" ingredients I feel more comfortable with his diet.<br /><br />When I went to the store to select his new food I stood in the dog food aisle for a long time and read every single dry dog food label in the store.  Chef Michael's was the one of choice.  One other thing I liked that the FIRST ingredient was beef.  Dogs are carnivores and need the protein.  I could do without the added color, but that obviously makes people feel better.  The food is loaded with tender pieces of beef and my dog loves the taste.<br /><br />My dog is small and this food lasts for quite a while.  If you want to keep it fresh, you might also want to add a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A6UF4U">Gamma Vittles Vault Plus</a> container to your order.

review/summary: Good for a picky eater - not good for a healthy eater
review/text: "Grilled Sirloin" sounds great for a dog food, and my dog was sniffing the package and followed me from the door to the kitchen with intense interest. He was more interested in this food than many types of treats he has had. So, if your dog is a picky eater who would lose weight rather than eat a food that doesn't interest it (I have had a dog like this), then this might be a viable choice for you in order for you to get your dog to eat.<br /><br />On the flip side, if your dog has no problems at mealtimes and you want to provide him/her a healthy meal at a fair price, you may want to keep looking. My dog eats 4 cups of his regular food, maintains his weight and energy and has good stools. With this food, he needs about seven cups and a couple more trips outside each day. More food and more waste, because less food/volume is being absorbed by the dog. Less nutrition and more fillers. Pet food manufacturers often split up a filler food into separate types (soy meal/soy flour) so that a meat type will move to first in line of ingredients. First up is "Beef" although not specified as grilled sirloin or not, it is still generally better than foods that start with four types of corn product or a meat byproduct. This also has poultry byproduct meal, plus 3 soy ingredients, 2 wheats, brewers rice, corn, barley,  and 4+ artificial colorings. While it is not the worst dog food on the market, it is certainly not the best, and certainly not at this price point. Your dog will probably love this stuff -kind of like how people love junk food.

review/text: Lexie is a picky eater and does not like most dog food or most treats.  But she loves Chef Michael's.  We discovered this brand about a year ago, and were astounded at how much better she ate than with other brands.  The Grilled Sirloin flavor is new to us, and she likes it just as much as the chicken flavor she'd been eating.

review/summary: Green marrow, not bag, irrelevant
review/text: ****<br /><br />When my six-year-old, seventy-pound dog, PheyeG'hdeaux, hears me opening his usual bag of Eukanuba he does wander over after a while and watch me till I've dumped several pounds into his giant feeding tub, and then he does typically aimlessly meander over to it and sniff it and eat some.  I think he's just checking to make sure I haven't added a live squirrel or a robin, both of which he's 100% sure he can catch out in the wild if he tries just a little bit harder, which he always does but which never quite works.<br /><br />But shortly after I opened the bag of this product, Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food 4.5 Pound Bag, PheyeG'hdeaux not only RAN to the kitchen, he actively sniffed up a veritable storm as I walked a few steps here and a few steps there preparing to present him with the food that so tickled his extraordinarily sensitive olfactory palate.  He snarfed, if I'm using that term correctly, down several bites more than he would snarf up of Eukanuba, which tells me there's something special about this dog food.  I think -- and I admit I'm just guessing here -- that the Purina people have somehow managed to synthesize a special molecule or compound whose only purpose is to appeal to a dog's taste buds and smell neurons, and they've added it to the product under review.  If your dog is a picky eater, this might be a good choice.<br /><br />In any case it's important to consider not only taste and texture but healthfulness.  In order to test the nutritional value of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food 4.5 Pound Bag I myself went ahead and ate it exclusively for three days, and now that I'm conscious again I can report the results.<br /><br />First, second and third, it tastes awful.  I realize it might taste really good to a dog, especially if that dog usually eats Eukauba (but see my review of June 7, 2012, of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>) for years at a time with only the rarest of desserts of bunny carcass or cat poop, but as a human I can tell you here and now, without any doubt, that this product tastes awful not just after a few days, not just after a few bites, but after a few chews of the first bite.  There are different shaped bits and they are different colors, but no matter which bit you choose it will turn out to be dreadful shortly after you bite into it.  You try the first bit and it's nasty from the first chew to the last swallow.  Hopefully you try a second shape of bit, but it turns out to be even worse.  Still hopefully, you try a third shape or a different color, and it proves to be yet even more dreadfully awful-tasting.<br /><br />As I say, I ate nothing but Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food 4.5 Pound Bag for three days, and at this time I also wish to report that my bone marrow has turned green, which the many doctors who've attended to me since this morning when I had to take myself to the emergency room because of several unusual and quite alarming alarming symptoms say is not just uncommom but downright unprecedented.  Also, they say my blood tests indicate I'm pregnant, which is a whole new problem since, as you know from previous Amazon reviews, I'm still a virgin.  I'll keep you updated, because I think we might have something here.<br /><br />****<br /><br />I subtract one star because the bag is not nearly as handy as the Beneful one.  It's not as tough, and it has no opener or closer.<br /><br />In case you didn't click to read my review at http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BESE8R6UU51I/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VJ0B0I&nodeID=&tag=&linkCode=of the Beneful product, you probably should if you're ever going to get another dog or cat.  Go to the section titled AD LIB FEEDING.  Also, note that I have updated the list from seven pets to eight.

review/summary: Fast Food  for Dogs
review/text: Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food is like McDonald's for dogs.  The stuff looks tasty, smells great (apparently), and must taste really good because my papillon practically swallows the stuff whole without chewing.  But, is it healthy?  Not really.  If you read the ingredient list (and read a few of the user reviews), you'll see that this dog food is really not that healthy (or that great of a deal, considering how much more the dog needs to eat in comparison to a high quality brand to get full.<br /><br />If I were judging this dog food just based on favor and reaction from my dog, this would be a winner!  He loves it and sucks the stuff down.  However, if I were judging from the more parental side, I probably wouldn't give this to him to eat all too often just based on the nutritional value.

review/summary: My friend's 2 dogs and 5 shelter dogs ate this dog food eagerly
review/text: Since my friend is into rescue work, I figured this dog food would be great to test on her two dogs and the five shelter dogs she is working with.  All the dogs ate this food eagerly and they were not starving dogs; so I'd say it gets five stars for taste.<br /><br />According to the packaging, Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food is 100% Complete and Balanced for adult dogs with 23 essential vitamins. Since dogs are carnivores, meat should be high on the ingredient list and the first four ingredients in order are beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (from of Vitamin E).<br /><br />Each serving contains:<br />Crude Protein 28%<br />Crude Fat 16%<br />Crude Fiber 3%<br />Moisture 12 %<br /><br />Overall, the dogs loved it and since the food states it is 100% complete and balanced and the first ingredient is beef, I give this five stars.  From the dogs point of view, it appears to be delicious.

review/summary: Dog enjoyed it but ingredients no better than any other Purina brand - Lotsa CORN, WHEAT & GLUTEN
review/text: The images on the bag make this Premium Purina dog food look well worth the price but a quick look at the Ingredients list should warn you that if you are gonna spend extra money on your dog's food, you might as well go for the brands that DON'T fake you out with photos of sirloin steak and fake green beans formed from corn & dehydrated green beans.  I'll be truthful - my dog loved this and ate it happily.  I mixed it it with his regular dog food and he just gobbled it right up.  However, my dog doesn't do well on foods loaded with grains so I won't likely be buying this despite how much he loved it.  Here are the ingredients in order by weight:<br /><br />Beef  - good to see it's the Number 1 ingredient but from her, it gets sketchy<br />Soybean meal<br />Soy Flour<br />Animal fat<br />Brewers Rice (an empty calorie filler leftover from Beer making process)<br />Soy Protein Concentrate<br />Corn Gluten Meal (another filler)<br />Ground Yellow Corn (filler)<br />Glycerin<br />Poultry By Product - (ground up bones and feathers)<br />Ground Wheat<br />Animal Digest (??? I think I know what this is and it makes me sick)<br />Pearled Barley (Grains again)<br />Calcium Carbonate (ground up rocks)<br />Calcium Phosphate (ground up rocks)<br />Salt<br />Grilled Siloin Steak FLAVOR (no meat)<br />Dried Grean Beans<br />Dried Potatoes<br />Sulfur, Vitamin E,<br /> Choline Chloride,<br /> Zinc Sulfate,  Ferrous Sulfate (both colorants)<br />Added colors - about 5<br />Niacin<br />Wheat Flour (grains again)<br /> and so on and so forth.. the same as basically what's in Beneful.<br /><br />My advice - if you have to go with a Grocery Store brand, don't be folled by a fancy photo on the bag of Sirloin Steak.  Compare the ingredients and buy what you can get the most of for your money IF YOUR DOG CAN EAT THAT STUFF.  Mine can but I still go the extra mile and try and by a more meat based diet.  While I was pleased that Beef was the first ingredient, I prefer to see the first few ingreidents be meat and never to see fillers like Corn and Brewers Rice.<br /><br />So  2 stars for taste, 1 star for being the same as every grocery store brand from Purina who makes this and  two stars OFF for deceptive packaging and advertising.  READ THE LABELS!

review/summary: Read Ingredients First.... Nutrition is Misleading....
review/text: So its been a week since I let my dogs "try" this food. We have 4 dogs so this bag went quick! 3 Small dogs, Shih Tzu and Maltese's and One Yellow Lab, all adults.<br /><br />The product states how tender the pieces are and how your dog will love it... and that they do... It also says theres no artificial perservatives and that the #1 ingredient is the beef that your dog wants.. but... is this what your dog needs???<br /><br />Just because the product looks good and colorful and says your dog wants it doesn't mean its good for him. This was more like a treat for my dogs then "food" and even then a very unhealthy treat. There is a ton of soy and corn in this food and by products. I think the colored bites are more to please the humans then the dogs! That means there are aritifial preservatives or flavors or colors of some sort to get the colors. Does a dog really need this? but mainly is it healthy.... For a 4.5lb bag of unhealthy food it is pricy too.<br /><br />You are what you eat... and if you give your dog a healthy food with NO byproducts and no corn etc.. your dog will be alot more healthy (and less gassy if gas is a factor) I'd recommend trying good healthy food for a week or two if your not already, you will see a difference and there are a bunch out there on the market. Yes they are more costly.. but think of the benifits as well. Why give your dog stuff thats unhealthy? Can lead to problems... and more bills.<br /><br />I don't recommend this food, and my dogs enjoyed their short treat while it lasted. We didn't fully finish the bag either as after a few days I didn't want to keep giving them "junk food"

review/summary: Struggled with this rating because my dog loves it.
review/text: I picked this up on a whim. My thought was to uses a very small amount as a sort of snack for my dog before bed.<br />I do this with my cats, too. I give them each a very small amount of a dry cat food that is low on the nutrition scale,<br />but high on the cat  junk food scale. I had been giving my dog an oatmeal biscuit or two each night. When I saw this<br />I thought I would try it and give him the same sort of treat as I do the cats.<br /><br />First of all, he loves it. He practically kisses my feet when I give it to him. It has an odd texture, in my opinion. Sort<br />of similar to a handful of raisins, not quite dry but? And Duncan gobbles it up and clearly wishes for more. I have a<br />fairly spoiled dog. Due to health issues, I cook for him every week. He eats cooked fish, beef or chicken with rice or pasta<br />peas, and some supplements. So if I ever do give him dog food in any quantity at all, it is a very high quality, not so yummy<br />as this ( apparently) dog food. So I am very concerned with what is in the food he is given. I see no problem with a tablespoon<br />or two a night for my 70lb dog, but I would not feed this as his sole diet. The nutrition value is very low, which is usually the<br />way it is with the food dogs like best.<br /><br />So, I really wanted to give this a higher rating since he likes it so much, but since I am writing this for dog people who are<br />surely interested in keeping their dogs healthy as well as happy, I had to go with two stars. Now, as a treat, or an occasional<br />meal, I see no problem with this. Dogs enjoy junk food, too.

review/text: The rating is one star because the dog liked it a lot and one star in thanks for the Vine program which allows us to try products without spending good money on them.<br /><br />My dog is 130 Mastiff and he did not like or eat the Beneful dog food that we reviewed a few months ago. Not so with this bag. He was interested in the smell as soon as I opened the bag and ate the whole bowl when it was placed in front of him. He is not a dog who is normally interested in food. He doesn't beg at the table, shows no interest in scraps and usually has to have wet food mixed in with the dry before he will eat. His preferred diet is couches, dog beds, remotes, eyeglasses, and a 9" ratchet wrench. Yet he likes this food. I wonder what the attraction is , since he usually shuns table scrap meats.<br /><br />In spite of the fancy name, the colorful textured kibble, the grilled sirloin label, this bag is full of stuff that is not good for dogs as a daily diet. Too much soy, soy products, artificial colors, etc.<br /><br />We will be using this bag as a training treat, because he seems to like the taste, but we are still on a hunt for real, unadulterated, healthy food.

review/summary: My dogs like it
review/text: I'm not normally a dog owner who buys her furbabies food made with either corn or food coloring.  My five big dogs eat a variety of high-quality brands like Taste of the Wild Lamb, Blue Buffalo Chicken n' Rice, Dogswell Chicken or Wellness 5.  I rotate these brands to add variety for them.  They graze out of a large bucket as they please.<br /><br />I poured the contents of this bag into the bucket, separating it from the Taste of the Wild kibble already in the bowl.  I wanted to see if my spoiled dogs would care for this stuff.  The contents did look like little pieces of ground steak and peas, only dried.<br /><br />Well, the two youngest dogs went right for this product with gusto.  Perhaps my mutt Zeke really did think he was eating Grilled Sirloin Steak and peas?!  HA!  The first ingredient listed on the bag is indeed "Beef," but for the pet food industry that basically means anything from the cow not suitable for human consumption.  "Grilled sirloin steak flavor" is in this stuff, but further down the list, after soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat, brewer's rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley,  calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate and salt.  There are also four added colorings to this.<br /><br />(For a more detailed list of ingredients and their true effect, please read the one-star review by Brenda Franks below.)<br /><br />Crude protein is between 16-28%, crude fiber between 3-12%.<br /><br />The fact that my active dogs ate this stuff must mean there's something in it they like, so this is not a total waste.  I would buy this food if I were on a strict budget since there are better nutrients in this food than in most other popular Purina dry foods for dogs and cats.  In fact, for those whose pets love this stuff, a better deal would be the larger bags of this stuff.<br /><br />If you do not like serving your pets corn or food coloring, though, stay away.  This food won't harm your pets if served only occassionally--the "beef" chunks could serve as treats during training sessions--but for those who want to feed their dogs the very best, look for foods that do not contain food coloring, corn or other cheap fillers.<br /><br />I posted two photos of two of my dogs eating this stuff.<br /><br />UPDATE 22 July 2012:  After gobbling up the entire 4.5-pound bag in 24 hours, the dogs are obviously telling me they really, REALLY like this stuff.  Unfortunately, it gave the dogs some serious runny, yellow poop, and lots of it.  I scooped up more poop in a 24-hour period than I normally do feeding my dogs the high-quality dry kibble.  Poop isn't normally yellow, nor is it runny soft.  The yellow is from the undigestible food coloring.  Just remember that healthy food creates healthy, dark, solid poop!

review/summary: He ate it once and then never again
review/text: We have three dogs.  One will eat anything, one will eat almost anything, and one is a picky eater.  Fortunately, the picky eater is the chihuahua.  Part of the picky eating comes from his sensitive stomach, and we avoid chicken and turkey because that consistently upsets his stomach.<br /><br />The first time he was offered Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food, he devoured it with pleasure, and I was ecstatic to have a dry food that got some enthusiasm.  Unfortunately, that enthusiasm was gone by the next day, and he absolutely refused to eat it for two days.  We gave up.  If he'd rather eat the big dogs' food than eat his premium food, there is no  point in spending extra for a more expensive food.<br /><br />From my point of view, the "premium" seemed to be mostly the "Chef Michael" name, as it didn't seem to have any better ingredients than the other Purina foods.  Beef was the first ingredient, but it was followed by soy meal and soy flour. (Can we say GMO?) It also contained chicken by products (a long ways under the soy products, by the way.)  Even salt appears before green beans and potatoes.  It is cuter than regular kibble, but I don't think the dogs care.  It also has varying textures, but once again, even when I let the big dogs try it, they weren't overly impressed.<br /><br />My opinion is that either spend more and get real premium food or save your money (unless you want attractive kibble) and just buy a standard dog food.

review/summary: Great taste, but not something I'd feed my dog regularly
review/text: It took about ten seconds to realize that this product tastes great to my dogs.  We have a lab and a pug, and both of them attacked their bowls like I'd given them steak.  I'm sure they weren't happy when I went back to "boring" Hill's the following day, but this isn't a product I'd recommend for keeping any dog healthy.<br /><br />The reason I've only given this product four stars is that many of the ingredients aren't something I want my dogs eating regularly.  They don't have many problems with soy, but I know a lot of other dogs do.  They (and I) do have problems with the heavy use of corn, the always-worrisome chicken by-product, and artificial colors.  That last one seems like an obvious admission from the makers of this product that they're really targeting dog owners more than they are dogs.  My lab certainly wasn't awestruck by the various colors on the package.<br /><br />My feeling is that this is a nice treat or occasional meal-topper for my dogs, but it won't be something I purchase for daily consumption.  Both dogs certainly love the taste, and I commend Chef Michael for that, but for long-term health I'd recommend other options.

review/text: The picture on the bag of the food looks really healthy. One can only assume by the name they are trying to push a better food product for our beloved pets.I mean Chef Michael's? How can someone not buy it? It has to be great!<br /><br />My dog ate it quickly, but then again, my dog isn't a picky eater.<br /><br />I had a bag of Blue Buffalo. I try to feed my dog better food. Here are the list of the first few ingredients: deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground brown rice, whole ground barley, oatmeal.... etc. etc.<br /><br />This is what is in the Chef Michael's: beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed tochpherols(eh whats that?) brewers rice, soy protein concentrate etc. etc.<br /><br />As you can see there is a big difference. While the food looks decent. Its softer. The brown stuff looks like meat. And it has bits of yellow/brown and green hard nuggets.<br /><br />While your dog will probably eat it, I'd say spend the extra 4 bucks and get a bag of something better. Its $13.87 in the store for a for a 4.5 pound bag.  I think I paid $17.00 for a 6 pound bag of BB. Or something a little healthier.<br /><br />Bottom line is that each pet owner must choose what they think is best for their four legged buddy.

review/text: Beef might be listed as the first ingredient but that hardly makes it the main ingredient.  After reading the ingredients list this "food" seems to be mostly made up of various forms of soy.  I am not a fan of soy & with all the GMO crap being pushed on us, I like it even less.<br /><br />Upon presenting this artificially flavored & dyed product to my fur babies, they started to eat up.  But then one by one they stopped & looked at me as if to say, "What is this crap?  We don't want this.  Where's the stuff you normally give us?"  I left the food for them.  Several hours later, the food was still in the bowl & a disgusting explosion of black runny vomit was all over everything.  Jerk that I am, I continued to try to get them to eat it.  After all, I have a review to do - that's how I ended up with the food in the first place.  After several days I gave up.  One of my babies simply stopped eating.  That was the final straw.  I am not torturing my pets any longer.  They are back on their usual grub. No more black vomit.  Everyone is once again eating until the bowls are empty & my furbabies are back to their joyful behavior.

review/summary: Dogs like it. I don't.
review/text: Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food, doesn't that sound tasty? The packaging is slick and pretty. And, really, who wouldn't want a chef preparing their dog's food?<br />We have three dogs, a Boston Terrier and 2 Doxles, (beagle/mini dachshund). They are normally very picky eaters, and yet they loved this! It even LOOKS appetizing! Chunks of stuff that looks like meat and more chunks that look like healthy veg!<br />So, the dogs loved it, why am I giving it a 3 star rating? The ingredient list. There is so much grain in this food, you may as well buy the cheap stuff! I choose to feed my dogs something that is better for them! Go back to the kitchen, Chef Michael and try again!

review/summary: Doggie Desert - updated review a week later
review/text: I may want to live on caramel and ice cream, butterfingers and apple pie - but after a few months of this diet, I'd be an overweight diabetic. This dog food, even though the name sounds (lets use the thesaurus here) resplendent, delightful, and even pulchritudinous (!) - is canine candy. I mean, come on - "Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin"? Sounds like something I'd want to eat. But read further, and it's "sirloin flavored" and is full of corn and other fillers.  Sure, the way my dog devoured this looked like I had not fed him in days - he was ready to lick the chrome off the bowl. "Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin" is a name dreamed up by the marketing department.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the food is flavor and filler, low quality protein, and high in carbs/calories.  If your dog is a lay-about, couch potato, indoor pooch - this stuff is better as a mix-in for finicky eaters, or as an occasional treat. A dog will have to be pretty active to burn off the calories if this was his/her staple.<br /><br />A week later? The dog won't touch it. Just nuzzles the stuff and gives it a tentative lick. Guess he wizened up!

review/summary: it's okay... but there's so much better available for the buck!
review/text: The Chef Michael's dog food by Nestle Purina is an OK dog food, but there's soo much better available for similar bucks with wholesome ingredients such as bison, salmon, blueberries and tomatoes. Examples include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W5U5H6">Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, Hi Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison & Venison, 15-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />My German Shepherd Dogs took to Chef Michael's much better than to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a> but not nearly as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W5SLB8">Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, Hi Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison & Venison, 30-Pound Bag</a> which they absolutely love and thrive very well.<br /><br />To my stunned disbelief the bag of Chef Michael's recommends feeding 1 cup per 10 pounds of dog's body weight. 9.5 cups of dog food, per day.. wow... imagine the "landmine waste" they would be producing! I have 95 pound dogs... they only eat at most 3 - 4 cups of Taste of the Wild.. usually much less. The reason being is rather evident in the list of ingredients:  beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled salmon steak FLAVOR, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E Supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (red 40, blue 2, yellow 5, yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, l-lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium panthothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyrodoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menodione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite. According to the package the Metabolizable Energy (ME) is 3801 kcal/kg, 1728 kcal/lb or 270 kcal/cup.<br /><br />The Chef Michael's customer service is 1-866-738-3663 Mon - Fri 7am - 7pm CST.

review/text: Unfortunately he can't write the review!<br />Whenever you switch dog food on a dog they will be all excited the first time. Discovering something new in their bowl , scarfing up how ever much you give them; and then the newness goes away. A few servings and they seem tired of the taste.<br />Not so with this Chef Michael's product. Until the bag was empty , our dog looked forward to his morning feeding with great anticipation.<br />Usually the dog is in our bedroom waiting for us to get up...three of the last four days he has been sitting by his bowl.Think he likes it

review/text: My dog loved this food. He scarfed it down and wanted more. However, when I looked at the ingredients, I was disappointed. Lots of soybean meal and soy flour, and corn meal. Is it really so hard to make dog food that's not full of this stuff? When I buy Purina, I'm expecting something that is actually good for my dog as well as delicious. A definite let-down.

review/summary: My dog likes it a lot but the quality is not 5 star
review/text: Opening the bag I noticed there's no zip to reseal.  It would be helpful if there was even a zip closure. I had to put the bag up high because I was worried about my dog food loving cat getting in it - she was all over it. It smells like people food to me, it's got a smell that is a lot like steak.<br /><br />My dog eagerly ate it, even though he really shouldn't have been all that hungry.  His first taste of this was after he'd already ate his regular food.  He seemed to really enjoy it and he ate it all.  He can be picky about food and is one to turn his nose up at a lot of the healthier dog foods.  He's also the type that will leave kibble in the bowl of a certain type in a combo if he doesn't like just that type - but he ate all of this.  There wasn't a chunk left in his bowl.<br /><br />The ingredient list is subpar though so I can't give it 5 starts- it has corn and soy both, and it is probably filled with GMOs.  The rest looks like it is mostly animal byproducts and flavor enhancers.  For the price I'd expect it to be a bit better.  My dog has not had any gas issues or allergic reactions though - he is allergic to a fleas and who knows what else but this has not bothered him.

review/summary: Gourmet Supermarket Kibble
review/text: If you feed your dog Supermarket grade kibble, then this might be a step up for your dog in taste if not nutrition.  Two of my dogs loved it, the third, who has a sensitive stomach, didn't really care for it.  It has nuggets that look like vegetables and others that look like bits of meat although the distinction is purely cosmetic.  The meaty bits are supposed to be tender but they felt as hard and crunchy as the rest of the nuggets.<br /><br />Also, the protein content is pretty high at a minimum of 28%.  I know, we have been told by dog food companies of late, that our dogs crave meat and lots of it.  The truth of the matter is that too much protein can damage your dog's kidneys.  Sadly, we found this out the hard way with our beloved Shiloh.  The pain and expense of having a dog suffer through kidney failure is significant and not something I would want to go through again.  Our vet told us that we should switch to a kibble with a protein content in the range of 18-20% and to get out of the habit of feeding our dogs high protein treats like jerky and pig's ears.  I don't know, but you might want to talk to your vet about it before switching.<br /><br />Now on the other hand, if you feed your dog premium dog food or organic premium dog food, then I would definately not advise switching.  Our vet also recommends organic natural dog food based on a suspected link between preservatives and fillers used in cheaper dog food and certain types of cancer in dogs.  Some articles I've read in various dog magazines have also reported the link between preservatives in dog food and cancer in dogs.  Again, you might want to discuss this with your vet.  Also, FYI I'm suspicious of any vet who tends to only recommend the brand of dog food that they sell at their office.  So, if this happens to you you might want to do your own research on line just make sure your truely getting an unbiased opinion.<br /><br />So anyway, I had been feeding our dogs the "good stuff" for several years but my husband would frequently comment (which in guy speak is like complaining) on the doggy food bill.  He ultimately suggested that we give this stuff a try because, after all, Chef Michael feeds it to his dog.  So I tried it and well, I'm sorry to have to tell you this dear but we're switching back to the premium stuff.

review/text: I will echo the concerns about the healthiness of this product but without question, my dog ate this food like nothing else I've given her. The odor is<br />not overly strong and it does appear to be a nice mix of meat and vegetables. I will be using this as a supplement to her normal dog food, which is much healthier but for a little treat, I'll mix this in with her food. The pellets are small enough that you could use these bits as a snack and not for the principal meal.

review/summary: Our dogs love it
review/text: I was surprised watching out two Huskies eating Chef Michael's creation and then asking for more because they would not normally eat bagged, dry dog food unless hungry. This may be a first because, as it's probably the case with most dogs, they would rather eat human food then dog food and if human food wasn't available they'd first go for some fresh 'rabbit' or 'field mouse' if they could catch any.<br /><br />I haven't tasted the food myself but our dogs seem to find it delicious. As for its nutritious qualities, the number one listed ingredient is 'beef' so it appears to be so. There is some text on the bag claiming that there are vitamins and minerals that would give the dog a shiny coat but that's probably speculation. I don't know of anything that I could eat and make my hair turn shiny so I can't see how such a miracle food ingredient could exist for dogs. If you want your dogs to have a shiny coat, there's shampoo.<br /><br />The food appears to smell good too and it comes in a variety of bits, some soft, some crunchy. The bits come in different colors but that's probably something that we humans are more likely to notice or appreciate because dogs' vision is believed to be either black and white or something close to an old 50's color TV.<br /><br />Since this is the first 'from the bag' food other than Milk Bone that our dogs actually love, it gets a well-deserved five star rating.

review/summary: Good Enough For A Dog
review/text: This dog food has beef as the #1 product ingredient as well as 23 essential vitamins and minerals.  Yet that isn't good enough for a lot of people out there.  Yes it has soy and corn in it.  Oh well.  Dogs will eat it up.  Who cares from what part this by-product comes from?  Dogs are scavengers folks, just check Wikipedia.  Some use this product as a dog treat -- great idea.  I suppose if you have a show dog this dog food will not be good enough for you, but what did you expect for this price?  The only think that really bothers me about this product is the food coloring added.  Is that for the dog owner or the dog?  I just can't see the dog really caring about the color of the food.  The dog bag is a thicker plastic sealed extremely well so this food is going to be air tight.  I'm not a big fan that I have to use scissors to open it however.

He ate around the kibbles first, then finally gobbled them up with the rest of his canned food. He won't eat any dry dog food unless it's mixed into his canned food.<br /><br />Our mutt loved this food, but she'll eat anything.<br /><br />Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin contains mostly semi-moist kibble bits and some crunchy bits too.

review/summary: Doggy Crack
review/text: My dog loves this stuff.  That's a bad sign.  We normally feed her very healthy dog food, and she always looks at us with disdain when we put it out for her.  We've tried plenty of different foods and it's clear to me that her appetite is just like our kids': The worse it is for her, the more she likes it.<br /><br />The price for this small bag is also higher than I like to pay for dog food.<br /><br />I'm not a health nut by any means, but the ingredients look more like Cap'n Crunch than a  healthy meal for my dog.<br /><br />I will keep this bag (and maybe even buy more in the future) for when we camp.  Our dog is always off her feed when we take her camping.  She loves to camp, but there are so many distractions that she tends to ignore her food.  This isn't good when we're out for more than a short weekend.  So on those longer weekends, it's puppy Cap'n Crunch for her.

This puppy will eat just about anything put in front of her, intended or not, but she absolutely devoured this stuff.<br /><br />The issue is that it has a lot of soy, corn, and rice, and unidentified animal fat high on the ingredient list. It does have beef listed as the first ingredient, which is probably why Sissy loves it so much. I am not sure that it isn't "good enough", but this will not be our dog food of choice and it will be given as a treat on occasion.<br /><br />Recommended, with the caveats above.<br /><br />CFH

And, most importantly, with all the dog food scares from food made in China and distributed by US companies, I make certain that it is both manufactured AND distributed in the USA.  This product met my requirements and my dog's appetite and my reward was a slobbering kiss.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LANN56">Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food 4.5 Pound Bag</a> is listed in Grocery and Gourmet as well as the Pet section of Amazon but I would not at all label this as a gourmet item.  I would not rely on this food as a nutritional foundation for dogs and would only either mix it with another more healthy food or would present it as a tasty artificially enhanced treat for training or rewarding purposes in limited amounts, sort of like liver treats.  Our dog likes it and it's a good size kibble for her, but I just can't get behind the ingredient list on the package.  Is Purina preparing for a doggie food channel by creating an imaginary Chef Michael?  If so, I wish Purina would use better ingredients.  If you don't really care about ingredients, then I'd still recommend another option because I think this one is more expensive than others in the same class of dog food product.

Frankly, they went bonkers over Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. I'm probably not going to make this part of their regular diet, but I will continue using it as a treat.

review/text: I have a beagle who is a pretty picky eater (weird for a Beagle, but she's kind of a diva).  So I thought she might turn her nose up at this food, but I was totally wrong! She LOVES it-we did mix it with her normal Pedigree food so that she didn't get a sick stomach from an immediate switch, and I would recommend doing that if you're switching b/c this food is much more rich and fresh than normal dry dog foods.  The ingredient list includes A LOT of added vitamins (D-3, B-12, E, K) which is better than the Pedigree I normally feed her. It is dry, which is great b/c it keeps for a long time and requires no prep other than just tossing it in the bowl! It is considered a premium dog food, so that does make it more expensive, but it's a great treat that is good for my dog and she loves it too!

review/text: I've never seen my dogs go as crazy over a dog food as when I gave this to them.  They absolutely love it.  The food looks just like it does on the bag, with pieces that are supposed to be beef that look like shredded beef and then little round balls that are supposed to be potatoes and green beans.  The potatoes and green beans are a little under 1/2 inch, but the beef pieces are closer to 3/4 to 1 inch, so this food might be best for a bigger dog.  The smell of the food is not as strong as some other dog foods we've purchased, but it definitely must have a good flavor.  It's made by Purina, which has been around forever, so I think it's a product we can feel safe using.

review/text: I have two small dogs who are very picky eaters and they like this dry dog food. They don't like many dry dog foods, but they will eat this one, especially when it's mixed with some canned dog food. They like the beef flavors of the Chef Michael's canned food, so I'm assuming this dry food must have some of the same flavors. I noticed the larger pieces of food, which appear to be those that are the beef-flavored bites, get eaten first. They do eventually finish all of the food, which with my picky eaters is something to celebrate.

They grazed at this and didn't really finish it till their favorite part of the meal (the package of moist food) was added to the top. It is a healthy food, and just because my parents dog was not totally find it their favorite, doesn't mean all dogs will not like it.

review/summary: Finally! The spoiled dog eats her food!
review/text: My dog is spoiled. She was a rescue, but I think she forgets this. When I buy her food with crunchy dog food and soft pieces mixed up, she typically only eats the the soft pieces. And when there are both red and yellow soft dog pieces, she picks out the yellow pieces first. So, due to my dog's finicky eating habits, I did not have much hope that this dog food would impress her. Still, I try to expose her to different dog foods in hopes she will like one. We've tried quite a few varieties and I always end up giving unfinished bags to my neighbors to give to their pets.  This bag, however, will finally be finished.  My dogs loves the little steak pieces.  As a senior dog, the ability for her to easily eat the food is important and it was my perception that she was able to eat this food easily -- she ate both the moist pieces and the kibble.

review/summary: The dogs love it!
review/text: The 4-legged critics on my taste panel are 3 hardened street dogs who usually eat anything. Yet, they will turn up their noses at something if they don't like it. They liked this. These are rescue dogs and need fattening up. Fillers in a gourmet dog food will do nicely.

review/summary: Strong Steak Smell Gets My Dog's Attention
review/text: I currently use an upscale dog food, dry kibble with no grain, all meat and sweet potatoes. My dog likes it but gets sick of it unless I embellish it. So I was intrigued by Amazon's offer for me to try Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin. I decided not to replace my dog food with Chef Michael's but to use it as an enhancer and as a snack food.<br /><br />Bottom-line: My dog Gretchen loves Chef Michael's, both its strong steak smell and its taste. I decided not to do a total replacement in part because Chef Michael's has soy and corn ingredients and while I'm no expert I've read that these aren't prized ingredients in a top dog food. Let me say, though, that I don't know this as fact. This is just what people in the "dog community" tell me.<br /><br />However, if push came to shove and my picky dog would only eat Chef Michael's, I'd use it. For me what the dog eats is a huge factor. So if your dog doesn't have soy and/or corn allergies, you might give Chef Michael's a try.

review/summary: SHE LOVES IT!!
review/text: I've got to say this is the ONLY dog food my dog has ever tried and wanted more AND I don't have to doctor it up with shredded cheddar cheese or leftovers or anything else.  She just devours it!  I don't know how to recommend this any higher than that.<br /><br />I know it's a tad bit more expensive than some other Purina foods, but it's well worth the money.  I will be purchasing Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food again, and again, and again!<br /><br />Thank you Purina!!!

review/summary: My dog loves it
review/text: This is what I can tell you - my dog loves almost all of the food she eats, sneaks or straight out steals (she is a rescue dog with food issues). I cannot honestly tell you anything about this food (not having tried it myself) except that my dog loves it and snarfs it down.<br /><br />After looking at it on the package and than in the bowl my wife did make the comment that this dog food looks better than a lot of the stews and casseroles we have eaten.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: This part of the review is being provided by a cairn terrier -- her owner is just transcribing the notes. The terrier says: I have never been that crazy about dry dog food, especially when it's compared to that great mushy stuff that comes out of a can. But this smelled and tasted so good that I pounced on it immediately and scarfed it right up. And begged for more. It tastes like meat, so I guess it is.<br /><br />From Divascribe: I was surprised at how quickly my dog took to this food -- she's never been particularly enthusiastic about dry food before. But the bag says "Real beef is the #1 ingredient." I looked at the ingredient list, and beef is listed first. There's a long, long list of other ingredients, some of which don't sound that appetizing (poultry byproduct meal), but unfortunately that's the case with most dog food. It has a nice, beefy scent that got my dog to stick her head in the bowl. My only concern is that, because I have an older dog, this might be a bit rich for her. So I plan to mix it in with her regular dry dog food for a while. No problems so far, though, and one very happy dog.
