review/summary: Best pralines ever!!
review/text: I live in New Orleans and we are known for our deliciour pralines, but the coconut pralines that  I bought from Kelly B's for the second time in a month were the best I ever had. They are so fresh and just the right size. I could have eaten them all in one day, but I rationed myself to one a day. I intend to buy more.

review/summary: I prefer Sweet Mint
review/text: For those who've tried it, does it remind you of anything?<br /><br />To me, this tastes just like strawberry-flavored toothpaste that I had as a kid. It's rather unappealing, you feel like you shouldn't even swallow the gum juices because it's like swallowing toothpaste. The smell is deceiving, it's more accurate compared to a true strawberry. The texture is a little tougher than other Orbit gums to begin, then gets softer than usual and stays that way for a long time. It's not a bad gum, per se, but Sweet Mint, Spearmint, or even Sangria Fresca are a better bet.<br /><br />On a side note, I wish there was no aspartame or other gook in Orbit gum. The reason I chew Orbit is it seems to be a mainstream gum that has less coloring / artificial sweeteners than other gums. The coloring / aspartame, etc. are less than 2% of ingredients, while sorbitol is the main ingredient. I hope they will decide to phase out the unnecessary parts. I really couldn't care if the color of the gum matches the fruit flavor advertised as long as it tastes right. The industry could easily use stevia or any other combination of available natural sweeteners on the market. Anyway, rant over. Hope that was helpful.

review/summary: I've found my coffee!
review/text: I've tried so many different types of coffees, and this is my new standard.  Recently, Camano Island Roasters ran a promotion, and I was able to try most of their offerings.  Honduras Dark stood out for its blend of bold, smooth, sweet flavors.  There is no bitterness, and the flavor remains consistent--meaning the beans and roasting are top-notch!<br /><br />Coffee has recently been recognized for its health benefits.  This, then, is the healthiest of the healthy--it's organic and shade grown.  So, besides great flavor, this is a clean java.<br /><br />Finally, it is good to know that one of my most common pleasures in life is doing good for all involved.  Camano Roasters are a fair trade company.  Additionally, they contribute back a portion of their prophets to the farmers who harvest the beans.  So, with this brand, I get good taste, a clean bean, and the satisfaction of knowing that the economics are a fair deal for all.<br /><br />Camano Roasters do quality work with a quality product--and they do it the right way.  Amongst their beans, I found that Honduras Dark matched my flavor preferences to a T.

Caffe Kimbo is a rich, dark coffee that makes an excellent espresso, especially in a moka (stove top espresso pot).  It is rich, full bodied with a depth lacking in other brands.  Well worth a try!

review/summary: Caffe Kimbo
review/text: Naples is a city where very good coffee and excellent pasta are still produced. Neapolitans take their food - and drink - seriously. Coffee is generally served in cups that have been heated with steam,avoiding hot coffee and cold receptables. Even pizzerias have DOC in their title, meaning that all the ingredients used in making the pie come from the region of Campania. It is also a city we have frequented each September for the past 8 years.<br />At the point of being immodest, I believe I know good coffee, and Caffe` Kimbo is a very good choice.

Caffe Kimbo's taste and aroma is superior to other coffes around claiming to be the best. If you want a REAL Italian caffe experience with the golden crema you can see and taste, then you must try Caffe Kimbo Espresso Napolitano.

That said it is wildly popular in Belgium, you can't turn around without running into it or Milka.  And, from what I've heard/seen, Belgians know a little bit about chocolate.  Try before you buy or deal with the consequences.  As a disclaimer, no, I do not work for Amazon.

review/summary: Cote D'or 86% Best for Men and their Hearts!
review/text: Have been eating this chocolate for years: ever since discovering it. Firstly, the person who made the Off Comment! - you don't go straight into it - start with the 70%, then work your way up to the 86% - then go for the 100% - at this point you may want to try the Claudio Corallo 100% Original Cocoa Bars. (Only made from Original Cocoa beans, not from the hybreds you find in most of today's chocolate bars!) Another nice thing about the Cote D'or - break off 2 pieces, this is usually all you need to quench your appetite for chocolate - very rarely have I ever wanted to eat the whole bar! Usually lasts 5 days at 2 pieces a day. The higher the % of chocolate, the better it is for men's hearts - for men, milk chocolate is a killer!<br />PS. I buy this in Canada when it goes on sale at Shoppers Drug Mart for 2 for $5. Which it was this week, and I cleaned off the shelf this morning to put into my freezer - love it crunchy!

review/summary: Prince of Peace Organic Green Tea:  fresh, light-tasting, & no bitterness
review/text: I drink a lot of green tea, iced.  I use a Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Pot for consistent, high quality brewed iced tea every time.  I'm very impressed with Prince of Peace Organic Green Tea for many reasons.<br /><br />For one, the price is right!  They say on the box that they "buy in enormous volume and have eliminated layers of middlemen.  We do not have expensive advertising campaigns.  We are glad to pass our savings on to our customers..."<br /><br />Then of course there's the actual tea bag.  One thing that sticks out is the unbleached, brown colored bag.  Does it really make sense to be steeping organic tea from a *bleached* bag?  Not to me!<br /><br />But let's not forget the most important thing, the taste!  I'll compare this to Bigelow Organic green tea since that is the brand I'm most familiar.  The PoP tea is lighter, more delicate.  It has a mellow taste, not harsh whatsoever, as I find the Bigelow to be.  And it doesn't taste "grassy" like the other yet it does taste "green".  But this is the way authentic, organic green tea is supposed to taste.  No astringent, overpowering flavor like black tea.  This is due to less processing time; this is the very reason why all the beneficial chemicals remain intact, and why green tea is so good for you.<br /><br />I consistently steep six bags of green tea in the Iced Tea Pot for 3 minutes for 2 quarts.  So when I compare the two brands here I am preparing them in exactly the same way.<br /><br />The one thing I would recommend that you do when this tea arrives is to place the contents of the box inside an airtight plastic container.  The individual bags are sealed within paper, not the air tight packaging that the Bigelow tea comes in.<br /><br />If you're simply looking for a strong tasting beverage you will not be satisfied with this tea.  But if you're looking for an authentic tasting green tea to drink because of the health benefits, look no further.

Regardless I'm not a fan of the flavor so I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this product.  If you do buy this product I would recommend cooking it, then letting it sit in the refrigerator overnight in sauce as to completely soften up the cheese.

review/text: Our pup LOVED this bone. It's huge and meaty, and we took some pretty hilarious pictures of her trying to carry it around. But after a few days of chewing on it, the bone started breaking off in little, sharp, swallow-able pieces. I felt so cruel taking it away from her, but I felt that there was a pretty big risk of her either choking on one of the broken pieces or having it lodge in her intestine. I have bought lots of bones, tendons, and antlers in our girl's short life, but I have never seen one break off like that and for me it wasn't worth the risk.

review/summary: My Lab Loves these bones!
review/text: I have bought many of these bones for my 1.5 y/o lab. She is a chewing machine, and these will last her for about a week a piece. She likes to pick them up and drop them for some reason so they will break in half. Then she will gnaw on the knuckle part till it's gone. They do break into sharp pieces sometimes, but I just throw those bits away. All in all these are a great natural dog chew. Plus, with free shipping and no tax from Amazon you can't beat the price.

It is a dinosaur sized smoked legbone!<br /><br />The best part, I think I still have pieces of this thing laying around months later.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of bones, these lasted and didn't disintegrate. My dogs are very active chewers.<br /><br />I should go buy two more right now...

review/summary: It's a little danger for smaller dogs
review/text: My dog generally doesn't swallow without chewing, but she broke off a sharp little piece of this bone and swallowed it as I watched in terror. She gagged a few times and coughed it out, thank god. The piece that few out was definitely something that could of injured her if swallowed, I threw the bone away afterwards.

review/summary: Surprisingly big and dogs love it.
review/text: Both my 80lb yellow lab and 26lb mix dog love this bone.  The bone is huge!  Watching my yellow lab with the bone makes me think of that investment bank commercial which features a dog worrying about his bone.  So far the bone has lasted a week and is still >70% intact.  Both dogs take turns chewing on it and when the larger dog picks it up to carry it away the little one is in tow trying to grab it.  It's provided alot of entertainment for them and I'm glad to be able to give it to them at the start of the work week - I have another one waiting for them when this one is finished.  Bottom line - will order again.

review/summary: Great bone
review/text: I got this about two weeks ago & they are still going at it. It's better than the other mammoth bone I originally got for my 63lb dog. This bone was for my little girl but my bigger dog hogs it all the time. The smell is intoxicating & my guess why the dogs love it. When it does get broken down my dogs love chewing at it & eating it. They even eat all the little crumbs that it makes. They LOVED the skin (is my guess what that is) that was on the bone. They had a great time scraping that off first before they got to the real "meats" of the bone. I wish it had a filling bc they enjoy licking it quite a bit. I would def buy this again.<br /><br />Oh & let me add that it goes down okay. My dogs didn't get the runs which they normally do. The first night they did throw up but just a tiny bit, nothing compared to when they eat outside stuff. The nights afterwards they had zero problems. I also just noticed that when pieces do break off they don't automatically go for it. I guess maybe those pieces were not appealing to them? So your dogs may be able to differentiate the good and not so good pieces. This way you just throw it away in the case the little pieces your 35lb puppy can't chew doesn't get lodged in her throat.

review/text: Wow I wasn't paying attention to the item description because i was shocked at how large it is, But this is a good thing!!! My dog absolutely LOVES it. I love the scent of it, not personally but i believe its something that my dog will enjoy unlike the other chew bones you get in the stores that you can't even smell at all (Pleasant for me but not so good for my dog who likes things with interesting smells). I'm sure this will last for a few weeks, if not months. The oily coating of the bone might also be something the dog loves. Should be very flavorful for him. Will buy again.

review/summary: Beef Straganoff
review/text: January 3, 2012<br /><br />I purchased the Beef Stroganoff from Omaha Steakhouse last week. It arrived in a small tray covered with plastic. I didn't really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars.

review/summary: NOT better in person.
review/text: I was so excited when I found these cookies online, they were perfect for my sister's hello kitty themed birthday party, i was going to pass these out as favors. When I received them, I was less than thrilled. They are defintely a lot cuter online. I wasn't expecting them to be perfect (after all they are just cookies), but I wanted them to be made with more care/time. In the entire box, there are about 3 that I like. The rest it looks like someone made them very quickly. About 90% of the black outline of the face are jagged as if they did it on purpose, but only a select few have a nice smooth outline like in the picture. Many of the faces have tons of black marks from the black frosting, but the marks are extrememly noticeable on the white face and I'm embarrassed for the people who end up with a MESSED UP LOOKING HELLO KITTY. Also, many of the pink bows are mixed with black so much that it bothers me. I am not a picky person, but when I order Hello Kitty cookies, I expect them to be done decently. I am a person who makes things for parties and I put a lot of time and detail into my work. Next time, I will make these myself. Such a disappointment. I had high hopes for this item. Oh well. If you want to order these for a party and don't really care what they look like, then go for it, but if you want them to pass out as favors, I would suggest you think of something else. Hopefully by adding cute packaging and some ribbon I can salvage these. Next time, please make products that look more like the pictures. There needs to be quality control. Thanks.

review/summary: Good jerky, too much pepper!!
review/text: The jerky itself is very good quality. The only problem is how much pepper they load onto these pieces. It's so much that it burns my mouth and I can't even taste the jerky, all I can taste is strong pepper. Then it gets into the back of my throat and burns sometimes, or might get stuck in my teeth, all making for a very unpleasant experience!

review/summary: Never again
review/text: I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch.  I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor.  Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion.  I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away.

review/text: The price was very good, but I guess I know why.  I gave it 1 star because it's low in carbs and another because it's edible.  There is a distinct foul odor when you open the bag for the first time.  After airing the bag out, the first piece I tasted was like chewing shoe leather, dry and chewy without much flavor.  After the 2nd piece, the meat began to leave a bad chemical aftertaste.  I understand everyone's taste buds will be different so do yourself a favor and buy a small bag of this at Walmart before getting the big bags here.

These 2 purchases were the worst possible way to spend my money.  The meat was so dry I was not sure if I was eating dried rat tail or beef jerkey.  The "meat" caused sickness and lock jaw.  Jacks links is as good as scraps off leather shoes.  It was pretty incredible of them to sponser the WSOP but provide poor quality food at a ridiculous price.

review/summary: Great snack....even during battle!!
review/text: I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Amazon). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it.<br />For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product.<br />If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it!

review/text: I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you.

review/text: Good stuff....but.  I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag).  I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Amazon (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors.  I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there.  (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.  I will give kudos to Amazon for their customer service policies, though.  I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free.

I told them they could try it, but that it would be spicy. They agreed, took the small bites I gave them and continued to ask for more until the entire package was gone! The flavor is exactly as the title describes. It's sweet and spicy, and reminds me of a dish I would order at a Thai restaurant. It's not as Spicy as the Sweet N Hot, but it still has quite a kick. It's not my favorite flavor, but I still give it 5 stars for the great texture and good flavor (and the fact that my kids devoured it). I bought this package with my kids in mind.

review/summary: Varies in quality
review/text: I have had this on order for about a total of 8 bags. I first had a good experience and what seemed like a quality jerky and continued to keep it ordered on my subscribe and save account. The next 2 bags were awful. There were tiny bits and they were extra hard and grisly. I thought maybe it was just a bad run and let the next order come through. They were terrible also. It was like there was one or two decent strips of meat, and the rest was inedible. I'm not sure how this keeps happening. I had meant to cancel this subscription but remembered after I was shipped another pack of two. Maybe they'll be better but I haven't been eager to to open them. Roll of the dice, I guess.

review/summary: Mold all over! Be careful
review/text: This is my second order of Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack from Amazon due to lower price than other stores and I hit the jackpot.  You can see the pictures I upload for this product.  It has mold all over, which even can be seen from outside the bag.  Unfortunately I did not see it and put one in my mouth.  Few seconds afterward, the taste was so strange and my friend, who was about to eat, stop me from swallowing.  Try for yourself, but please be careful.

review/summary: Great product but the subscription ships old products.
review/text: I love this beef jerky and so I looked everywhere for it, and had trouble finding it readily. So when I found this product on subscription on Amazon, I was more than thrilled to subscribe. That was two months ago. I've now cancelled my subscription. Why you ask? The unopened packages of the beef jerky were hard as a rock and were tasteless as a result. I don't know what Amazon does to receive the jerkys so cheap thereby giving the customers the 15% discount, but I'd rather pay more and get them off retail and enjoy every piece.. I am very disappointed at the result and won't re-subscribe again.

review/text: I bought eight packs. Seven of those, I hope, were in good condition. One of them looks darker and has mold on it. I didn't notice that after I ate two pieces... That was disgusting!! It says on the package the jerky will be good until 2013. I guess the company is wrong.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon CS. After 5 minute they decides to give me refund. This is probably all that Amazon can do, but I will not buy any kind of food/snacks on Amazon anymore. And I will not buy any Jack Links product on line or in store. Their quality control is really doubtable.<br /><br />MOLD ON JERKY!! Be aware!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SIY3O2">Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>This order took five days to deliver and this is Florida with high humidity and high heat. Upon receipt I opened each package because I always place in my fridge in gallon zip locks. I ordered two of the mega two-packs and three of the four were fine. The fourth was FULL of mold which was visible through the packaging. I am seriously disappointed (and grossed-out). No returns/exchanges means I will NEVER purchase foods items from Amazon again.<br /><br />Update: After figuring out a way to contact Customer Service despite their policy of no returns on food items, they credited back 1/4 of total purchase price and offered free next day shipping for this item (which I will not use).

I wish I would've gotten pieces or a bag without any of it considering this is pretty damn expensive stuff, but it is good.<br /><br />They definitely need to work on quality control if they want to keep the prices so high for this stuff, or I might have to go to a different brand.

review/summary: Best ever
review/text: I buy a lot of stuff online and only write a review if something was very good or very bad.<br /><br />I honestly have to say that Jack Link's Jerky is the best jerky I have ever eaten (I've even bought some from a meat market before).  I have tried several of their flavors and all have been good.  The Sweet & Hot could be a little hotter, IMO, but it is still awesome and my favorite of theirs.  Besides the different flavors being good, what really sets Jack Link's apart from every other jerky I've tried is the quality of the meat itself.  The meat has the perfect amount of moisture, making it able to actually bite a piece in half without having to gnaw on it for 20 minutes.  While other brands aren't very consistent, particularly Pemmican, which I used to think was the best available, Jack Link's is very consistent with the quality of each piece.  Most brands usually have a mix of perfect pieces, dry pieces, and way too thick pieces.  Not Jack Link's, I've yet to get a dry piece, or one that was way too thick.<br /><br />The several people that I have "turned on to" Jack Link's would fully agree with me about this review.  We've actually spoke about how amazed we are with it.<br /><br />Walmart is the place that I first found it, and they are always out of stock of it.  So I turned to Amazon and was able to find it for roughly the same price when you factor in shipping.<br /><br />BTW, the package of ten 1.5 ounce bags is nice if you are like me and tend to just keep eating until it is gone.  :)  Also, each 1.5 ounce bag has about 25 grams of protein.  So if you are on a workout program, it makes a nice way to get extra 25 grams of protein with very little fat into your diet.

review/summary: By Far The Best Jack Links!
review/text: I love beef jerky, its perfect for work, packs tons of protein, easy to eat and store.  I have to say though the price of the stuff locally is insane, the 3oz bags go for up to 7 bucks a piece.<br /><br />This is the best deal I've found by far, select delivery 1 time a month for 16 bucks and sit back and wait for your jerky!<br /><br />Now on to the flavor, I usually buy the peppered Jack Links for the touch of spice.  Recently I found the A1 steak jerky, and its fantastic!  It seems like its more dry, like the homemade jerky I remember from my grandparents.  I find the most of the flavors to be to moist, and salty.<br /><br />If your a fan of jerky, and the taste of A1 sauce, you will enjoy this product, use amazons subscription option and save another 15%, excellent deal when compared to store purchasing.

I like beef jerky and Jack Link's especially, just not this flavor.<br /><br />Anyone who is a health nut may not like this because it's loaded with MSG, though I think most beef jerky is.

Way too sweet, doesn't taste like meat, and most of the pieces don't have the texture of meat.  At times, I thought I was eating plastic.  Or some soy meat-substitute.  I couldn't even make it through the whole bag.  I miss the original Pemmican..., before ConAgra sold the brand and it got ruined...

Looked through package window, and what was left of my jerky could not even be identified as jerky.  It was white yet covered with mold.  Couldn't see any evidence of a hole in the packaging.  It came in a 2-pack, and the 2nd pack looks fine but has the same date stamp on it, so I'm not sure I dare eat it.  They expire in December of 2013...14 months away.  I'm not sure what happened to it, just that I wasted $10, and I'm still nauseous just thinking about the sight and smell of it.  Is jerky even supposed to spoil at all?

review/summary: Taste good but not quite Thai Spicy
review/text: I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links.

review/summary: Pretty Damn Good Jerky
review/text: I've been trying different jerkys because my Dukan Diet allows it... Some have way too much sugar content. Thanks, Jack Links, for doing it up right! (3 grams sugar compared to 7+ in other brands.) The peppered flavor is spicy enough to let me know I ate something, but it's not so sweet it comes across like candy. I buy pound bags and divide it into five baggies, or I'd eat the whole bag at once. The meat is pretty clean, compared to other jerky I've had where every other mouthful is unfit for chewing. Best price I've found was through eBay buying in quantity, then dividing the bags myself. That last crumbly handful left in the bottom of the one pound bag is a real eye-opener, as that seems to be where all the pepper seeds congregate. Good Times! P.S. Lost 40 pounds on Dukan Diet in about three months and am very content with the foods I get to eat, jerky being one of them.
