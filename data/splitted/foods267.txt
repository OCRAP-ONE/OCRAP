review/summary: Sage Tea - helping with hot flashes
review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/summary: Red Clover Tea
review/text: I purchased this tea because it is recommended for helping women's PMS symptoms and menopause symptoms.  I've only had one cup of it, so I can't say if it has helped my symptoms or not.  I have purchased other teas of this brand.  I would recommend their teas.  I wasn't crazy about the taste of the red clover, but that is just my personal opinion.  It's a little bitter but bearable.  Add some sugar and you're good to go.

review/summary: Interesting taste
review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

review/text: I watched Dr. OZ on television and he was explaining how to minimize and/or avoid crows feet. His advice? Drinking Fenugreek tea, taking L-Arginine supplements and getting a good nights' sleep (6 hour min.). Well, I am going to give it a shot. This tea has an interesting taste-not your typical tea but not bad. It tastes pretty good with a bit of honey added actually. I wasn't able to find this tea in any local supermarkets but here it is on Amazon. Seems they have everything!

review/text: I have one cup a day and it really decreases my night sweats. I'm in amazement at how much it helps!<br /><br />The taste isn't great, but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviews have said. If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/text: Cook some Basmati rice and you have a meal for two.  This is an excellent product and doesn't need any additional ingredients.  Tastes almost as good as authentic Indian restaurant food.<br /><br />EDIT:  Changing the rating.  This last batch was a little bland.  It tastes OK, but not great like before.  With previous packages my wife and I would practically lick our bowls clean! With this last order, there is flavor missing.  It no longer has the strong spicey taste to it like the restaurants do.  We are really hoping it was just a bad batch.

review/text: I usually have pretty low expectations for boxed dinners, but this dish certainly was surprisingly full of flavor. There was plenty of spice, so I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is not a fan of hot, spicy food, but if you are buying food from this region, it's probably to be expected (the description calls it mildly spicy). The vegetables dominate the mixture, which was very easy to prepare, even in the microwave. Despite what the box says, you get one nice-sized serving per package. Considering this isn't a dish most would be likely to make on their own, it's a nice cullinary departure and worth a try.

review/summary: Not like the restaurants, but still good on its own
review/text: This definitely does not taste like the vegetable/navrattan korma I've had from restaurants. This is kind of oily and the vegetable korma I order out is always creamy. This also has cubes of cheese, which I've never had in my vegetable korma before. However, I think it has a good flavor. If I could describe it in non-Indian terms, it's a bit like a minestrone flavor, but of course it has that curry gravy. I would agree with the other reviews, I noticed maybe three pieces of cashew in this. I thought vegetable korma has raisins in it too, but this doesn't seem to have any. This is actually one of Kitchens of India's lower-calorie offerings -- I wondered how vegetable korma could be low calorie, but now I see it's because it's not creamy the way it is at restaurants. Still, it's decent if you don't expect the same thing you'd order out. Would go well with some basmati rice.

We added our own peanuts and cashews which was great.<br /><br />Aside from those small quantity issues, we just loved it.  My mom got this, and I grabbed some cause it sounded easy to make and it really was.  5 minutes max!  Smelled and tasted awesome and was perfect over rice.

Usually, I get concerned with products containing paneer (cheese) in prepackaged form, but the paneer in these packs turned out not to have the rubbery texture I was concerned about. Along with the special discount, the price on these packs is great as well. Unfortunately, as with most prepackaged Indian foods, sodium contact is high and the korma is pretty oily.

review/summary: Payback for US franchises fattening Hindus in India
review/text: What I mean is that the ratio of calories to grams of protein is unacceptably high, and there is too much butter used in the making. Also, the seasoning is slightly higher than mild for US tastes, although if you like Texas chili, you might like it. I think this is true for the Spinach Paneer, both of which I sampled right away on arrival.<br /><br />As a precaution, don't open the packet near an open flame. All the packets I have tested spurt a mix of oil and butter when opened, maybe a teaspoon or so in all, maybe a fire hazard, but also a bugle call for any household Florida cockroaches to come running (and be dealt with).<br /><br />If you want to blunt the spiciness, I recommend adding a tablespoon of protein powder and mixing in after heating. That also brings down the calories to protein ratio.<br /><br />OK, heat it in an Amazon stoneware saucepan-pfaendl using a multi-size Amazon lid to keep it from splattering. Pour it out over genuine Amazon kasha, with maybe some Amazon iodized table salt to taste, and the kasha justifies the butter somewhat. And, would you believe it, one (1) cashew, cooked until tender, included.

We make couscous because that takes less fuel than rice, and then each pick and boil a packet of curry.  It's the easiest way to get our veggies while in the desert for a week.

review/summary: The only kind of packaged food I will have!
review/text: While I am really picky when it comes to foods and their quality (not easy for a German in Amerika!), I am really happy to have found this brand on amazon a while ago. Now THIS variety must be new, because we saw it in May for the first time in a local store (for 3.99 a pack, imagine!!!) and shortly after it also appeared available here.<br /><br />It is mildly spicy, very well for european taste (we don't like things toooo hot!), and I love the little Tofu dices (they call it different). The cashews are few, and yes, they are soft, not crunshy. That comes from the simmering, I guess.<br /><br />We eat a pack a person, actually, over Jasmin (or Basmati) rice or Naan, when we find it locally. (I wished I could make Naan myself).<br /><br />A tip for variety: I am preparing different varieties of KOI for each person, and then the plates are exchanged to share. Usually it is just Hubby and me, so I make 2 different packs and we swap the plates after having eaten an half each.<br /><br />We are living on one small income in a low-income state, so we have to watch the money quite much. So I was enthused when I was able to stock up for half the price in June!!! Well, compared to local supermarket stores it was even better ( = less!) than half, as amazon's prices were already lower.<br /><br />I have stocked up really big, my pantry is now filled up with all KOI products for probably 2 or 3 years. Inflation, you can come now, we are ready! Ha!

review/summary: Good stuff...
review/text: I got this in the variety pack. The entire package, which I did eat in one sitting, is 325 calories and 12 grams of fat. For me, it requires something bland to eat it with, as well. As such, I very much enjoyed the nice curry seasonings and all.<br /><br />This has 3 grams per package more fat than the Red Kidney Beans Curry I also tried, but does include a broader variety of veggies and other ingredients.

review/summary: Quick, easy fix for Indian Food
review/text: These Kitchen of Indian meals are great for a quick and easy meal. They are not as good as going to a very good Indian restaurant, but they are close enough to give you a satisfying fix if you love Indian food and flavors as I do. Just make a few servings of rice to go along with this and you're all set.<br /><br />One of my local grocery stores actually sells these a little cheaper, but they never have carried the Navratan Korma flavor, so that's why I get them from Amazon. I also really like the Rajma Masala (with the red kidney beans) and the Palek Paneer (with the spinach and cottage cheese) flavors.<br /><br />Whether you already love Indian food or just want to try something new, spicy and flavorful, I can heartily recommend this brand.

review/text: I bought a bunch of the Kitchens of India items during a promotional sale and the only one I'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce. If they were tasty I could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but I'm not loving the taste. I ofter buy similar products from Trader Joes and those, in my opinion, are much better and cost far less.

review/summary: Includes free CD
review/text: I've bought this brand at World Market for more money.  In the case I ordered, the boxes each have a free Indian CD.  This is sort of ironic because I was playing one of the free CD's from a local purchase and it got stuck in the CD player.  Now I have a replacement.<br /><br />I knocked off 1 star only because these are higher calorie than some other brands.  I also really don't like the design of the box.  They're a "triangle" design (see picture on the side) and do not stack properly.  This doesn't seem to save any room in the case when shipping.  So I don't know why they made a box this way that's inconvenient for the customer.

review/summary: pre packaged food that's a little different
review/text: kitchen of india  navratan korma  is what I am reviewing.<br /><br />If you like Indian food, go to an Indian restaraunt.  If you dont have any nearby, and crave something to have at your desk or table that's a little different, already prepared, buy this.  I thought it was pretty good for pre packaged food.<br /><br />I dont have any expectations for packaged foods, so perhaps I'm setting the bar a little low.  I thought it was tasty!  Pop it in the microwave for 2 minutes or so, and done! It was seasoned nicely  and can also be cooked on stove top.<br />I would buy again, I first bought something similar to this at a local store, and after a few years, they didn't stock the same brand, or types of foods liked. So I went to amazon and looked to see if they had it.<br /><br />I think the package says it serves 2 or 3.  If you serve with a side dish like rice or salad or bread, it's enough for 2 to lunch on.

review/summary: Amazingly awful
review/text: Simply terrible in all aspects.  Far too salty.  Mushy/overly soft texture.  Unattractive brown throughout, lacking any fresh vegetable color.  Smell is unappetizing and taste is far worse.  We've visited seemingly every Indian eatery in NYC from Curry Hill to Zagat top rated to rat infested taxi stands and pushcarts in the street.  Kitchens of India Navratan Korma wins the prize for being tossed in the trash in record time.  What we were reminded of is if you want edible prepared Indian food, purchase frozen entrees...NOT unrefrigerated pouches.  The most redeeming quality is nobody has yet to go to the hospital with an illness as a result of this product (but it has only been an hour so that could be coming).  Spoke too soon--my stomach is starting to hurt.  You've been warned.

review/summary: So-So At Best.
review/text: I decided to try this because our grocery store was having a decent sale, but I am skeptical of Ready to Eat meals and doubly so of this brand because of my experience with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V1AWBK">Kitchens Of India Curry Paste For Vegetable Biryani, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. Although this wasn't as spicy as the Curry paste, it still had a bit too much heat for me. I think I may be getting more sensitive to hot, spicy foods in my old age.<br />There was only about 3 pieces of cashews and of paneer. Both were soggy and the paneer was tiny and had a spongy texture that was pleasant. The flavor wasn't too bad but it certainly paled in comparison to many restaurants I have experienced.

review/summary: Meh
review/text: These prepackaged curries are edible but not too tasty. Even by the low standards of Indian food in foil pouches. Do not even think of telling an actual Indian person this is any good. Really the only upside is that one of these just takes a couple minutes in the microwave to heat up, so if you need to eat RIGHT NOW and you don't much care what you eat, this could theoretically work. Though, if you absolutely must have curry in a pouch, I can think of at least one well-known private-label grocery store brand that is far better for roughly the same price if not cheaper. If you just want very fast food out of your own kitchen, there have got to be better alternatives.

review/text: You are guaranteed to lose weight with this product as it tastes so bad, you will not want to eat more than a few tablespoons. It is salty and has a bitter taste to boot. I wanted to avoid writing a negative review but i had this a few hours back (third occasion, since I ordered 6 of these) and a few hours later, the acrid taste still remains in my mouth. Hence I decided, I have to share my experience so that others do not jump in based on most of the other good reviews. Sorry folks.

review/summary: Best On The Market
review/text: This Southerner loves to make homemade "pimento" cheese.  In fact, I've perfected my recipe over the years, and a restaurant recently asked to add it to their menu. One of the secrets to my recipe is Mario Pimientos, and I've found them superior to anything else on the market. (Pimientos are made from the same pepper that is harvested for paprika.)<br /><br />Mario's pimentos have superior color, flavor, and texture. Additionally, the juice is a deeper red than other brands, and that means additional flavor. (If you need to drain these babies for a recipe, don't pour the juice down the sink. Add it to salad dressing or a Bloody Mary!)<br /><br />Kudos to Amazon for carrying Mario Diced Pimientos. This is a 5-star product, and, if I had five hands, I'd give it 5-thumbs up!

review/summary: Pricey but I'm Satisfied
review/text: This is a nice bag of 1lb of different kinds of dried seaweed: wakame, aka funori, kiriboshi wakame, shiro kikurage, ito kanten, kizami hoshi kombu, according to the label.  I'm somewhat new to seaweed but there's definitely a nice variety of colors (red, white, clear, light green, dark green) and textures among the seaweed- it looks beautiful in a salad. Sixty-some dollars is alot for a pound of food but at 1/4 cup (dry) per serving of sea weed salad, this will last you a while: the bag says there's 90 quarter-cup servings in the bag.  The sea weed swells alot when soaked in warm water.  Also, I live in the middle of nowhere and I can't just run out to my local Asian supermarket to see if they have a similar product for half the price.<br /><br />The seaweed smelled nice and fresh, a gentle ocean smell- no stinky fish smell, no "off" flavor.  There's no sauce or seasoning on it, you make your own.  Unlike the limp salads made of wakame leaves, this seaweed mix makes a light and "fluffy", "perky" salad.  This product definitely makes a fancier, better seaweed salad than I've had at the 6 or 7 Japanese restaurants I can remember eating at.  Although, if you are looking for just dried wakame stems, this is not that product.<br /><br />I googled and found a dressing I really like, made of 3T rice vinegar, 3T soy sauce, 2T sesame seed oil, 1tsp sugar, 1tsp grated ginger, 1/2 tsp minced garlic, 2 chopped scallions, all just mixed together.  (The dressing even stays good in a cup in the fridge for a week or two!)  I soak the seaweed for 10 or 15 minutes in warm water, drain, mix in the dressing, and it's ready.  To make a small amount of seaweed stretch further, I serve it on top of shredded carrot and/or shredded radish.  (I got that idea from my local Japanese restaurant.)<br /><br />Unlike Emerald Cove's 3lb wakame product, which is made in China, this 1lb sea salad is a product of Japan. The website says that it is wild-harvested along Japan's coast.  It's imported by Great Eastern Sun from Ashville NC. The label lists no preservatives or anything besides seaweed as ingredients.

review/text: Ok So I saw a Video of this online and I was like Dang I really want to make this at home. So I bought it and Wow the shipping is fast.  I've bought things from different countries and this shipping is fast considering that it's from japan. Well let me tell you about my experience with this candy.  Making it is fun it takes about 10-15 mins. to make it and you can get the instructions in English from [...]. The best part was making the fish eggs. The texture of the fish eggs is cool because it is like a skin around the egg and liquid in the center.  The rice smells like Sour apple and the fish eggs were sweet. The taste of the Fish gelatin (Red colored Gelatin) and the egg gelatin (The Yellow Colored Gelatin) was not too tasty.  It felt weird and not normal in my mouth and wouldn't eat it again.<br />I consider  this to be a fun little gift for a young teen or a kid that likes to make food.

review/summary: Great For Sushi Lovers!
review/text: I bought this for my daughter and she loved it. She is a huge fan of Japan and their wonderful culture. Even though she loves real sushi, she begged me to get this for her, because it's so cute and the reviews were great. This is the first of the Popin' sets I have ordered. I'm planning to try the bento one next.<br /><br />It's a bit smaller than what I thought it would be, but not dissapointing at all. It's very easy and fun to make, and pretty much all of the jelly like food is grape flavor but it's not to strong and it's sweet, some is sour but not very, I hate sour stuff but I could easily eat this, so no worries. The best part I think, was making the salmon roe eggs with the water dropper. It shipped to me in about a week, getting here just one day after it said it would. If you are looking into buying this, I say you should it's a wonderful gift or activity to do with someone! =D

review/text: The sushi kit from Popin' Cookin' is something I have had my eyes on for months--my friend and I have been watching the videos on Youtube on making these for a long time!  It was as fun to make as I expected, and you really do get to make "popping-boba-like eggs" to put on top of one of your sushi rolls, which is really cool and fun!  But, for what it's worth, I would view these as completely inedible, the grape flavor is very strong and the texture is...out of this world, like eating alien goo.  But!  That doesn't diminish the fun and novelty because, like eating anything from an Easy Bake Oven or a Doctor Dreadful kit, you don't expect much but it's fun to make, which is the whole point.<br /><br />And one note about the seller--they got it here about 2 weeks earlier than I expected with a handwritten thank you note!  Very classy :)

review/summary: Very Fun!
review/text: This was my first time ordering a Japanese candy, from Kracie, to be exact. I was so excited to receive it after watching many YouTube videos about it. I must say, it was so much fun to make this! Don't worry if you don't know Japanese, as you can either watch instructional videos from YouTube or follow the pictures, as they are thourough.<br /><br />All of the different ingredients smelled wonderful. The rice smelled like bubblegum. The egg and meat smelled faintly like mango. The seaweed smelled like grape. The fish eggs and soy sauce smelled a bit like mango, but more of a fruitier smell.<br /><br />Now for the taste. I loved the taste of each one, as they weren't overpowering. But the textures are what really displeased me. The rice was really cool because of the feel in my hands, but in your mouth it tastes kind of stiff and grainy. I think that the worst texture was the meat and egg. They were so grainy that I could barely swallow them, and to top it off they were on top of the rice. Yuck!<br /><br />The best taste and texture had to be the fish eggs. They are little gel balls, just like that product from a long time ago that Listerine made. It was breath freshener "mints", that were in the gelled ball form, and they exploded with liquid when you bit them, making your mouth feel fresh. I actually ended up saving the fish eggs instead of putting them on the sushi because I liked eating them. Also, the soy sauce and the mixture that you put the fish eggs in tasted wonderful, with that faint fruity taste.<br /><br />The product shipped the day after I order it (standard shipping), and came a week later (the first estimated delivery date). I was very happy about that, especially since it shipped from Japan.<br /><br />Overall, I think if you are considering it, buy it! It is such a fun way to make candy. Just beware of the rice, meat, and egg after you make it!

Otherwise I suggest you find directions online "how to make candy sushi" out of rice krispy treats, Swedish fish and fruit roll ups or come up with your own ideas and have fun!

review/text: It was my first time ordering food from Amazon.com.  These skittles arrived with undamaged condition.<br /><br />The only reason I gave 4 stars is because these candies have expiration date by May 2012 (only 9 months left). At local convenient store or gas station, I found ones with at least 18 months left, but I guess it is acceptable as these are dry-food.

The bags weren't defective, the skittles were indeed sour, and I found that some skittles' coating was melted. But that's more likely due to the climate here.<br /><br />Overall, there's nothing like sour skittles, and I only wish these were in stores still.

However, I was a bit disappointed with this purchase.<br />The item was delivered quickly as Amazon has fantastic shipping.  When I went to enjoy my first bag of sour skittles, I found that the candy appeared to be melted and the colors of the skittles ran into each other.  Moreover, the sour coating was minimal to non-existent.  I consistently found the same result with all the individually packaged bags.  I don't know if there was a storage problem or if I received a bad batch, but i wasn't satisfied with the purchase.

This NIDO Powder is just so natural, no preservatives or funny taste. I usually use it with tea instead of regular milk, or with cereal.  I ran out of milk last night actually, so I just added 3 full teaspoons to a glass of water and Voila! rich authentic taste. Can't praise it enough!  Brought me back to my childhood. I had bought 4 tins and I loved them so much I gave one to a friend to try! she loves it and now I'm ordering more, probably 8 this time! I love NIDO , this particular one not he ones that have baby pictures on them, those have added Vitamins I think. Not the same taste.

review/text: I had previously ordered baby hulless from Riehl's Select but tried Whirley-Pop this time since it was less expensive. It didn't seem to be baby or even remotely close to hulless, as many hulls got stuck in my teeth (and one still stuck at the back of my throat). It was lacking in taste, too - better off buying regular grocery store popcorn for the taste (if you don't mind the hulls). Amazon was great and refunded my money, but I'm going back to Riehl's baby yellow popcorn.

review/text: I ordered three types of popcorn to sample when I bought my Whirley Pop (which by the way is friggin awesome, get one, they are cheap and work so well!), all from Wabash. I got the baby white, the baby yellow, and the ladyfinger. Using 1/2 cup of corn and 2 tablespoons of oil in the whirley, both the ladyfinger and the baby yellow would pop up fluffy enough to fill the entire whirley. The white consistently only fills about halfway...it just doesn't taste as light and crisp either.  Recommend going for the ladyfinger (tastes the best and the least hulls by far, but it's so tiny it's almost hard to eat without dropping a lot) or yellow if you're trying this brand. Hope this helps.

The small white popcorn is tender, but the hulls are still there in high volume.  So I will NOT be eating it.<br /><br />Order at your own discretion.

review/text: My best friend in high school (1980s) and I once ate a whole bag of these after a particularly strenuous workout at the gym. They're addictive and go down sooo easy. I just wish we had a gallon of milk to go along with them.<br /><br />While to my more adult taste buds these are a bit sweet and have a hint of mass produced taste to them, they are still great cookies. Especially when heated up until the chocolate chips are just starting to melt. Serve with a cold dairy beverage and you have yourself some baked nirvana.<br /><br />I prefer homemade cookies now to the Keebler variety, but if you need a quick fix and don't mind the sugar and calories, then you could do a lot worse than these elven concoctions. They get 2 thumbs up from my kids as well!<br /><br />~ Kort

review/text: This is definately chihuahua puppy approved. I like the fact that there is a puppy food for smaller breeds. These are real small bites. My puppy was 2.16 lbs at 7 weeks and tiny, so having something that is small enough for him to chew. At 5.5 months old, he still enjoys it. I also like that this small bag is resealable and helps with keeping it fresh.

review/text: I have been using this dog food for quite some time, until my dog started throwing up and basically wouldn't eat much of this dog food anymore like he used to.  I stopped feeding him this dog food and bought organic.  My dog started eating again and stopped throwing up. I will not be buying this dog food anymore.

review/text: Hill's Science Diet Puppy Small & Toy Breed dog food provides precisely balanced nutrition to meet your small breed dog's special needs.It is the only brand with an exclusive blend of clinically proven antioxidants.This formula is specially designed to boost immune defenses and support the long life expectancy of small and toy breed dogs.<br />There a myths that allergies are caused by ingredients such as corn but that is not the case. To say that something is a filler would imply it has no nutritional value; when in fact corn is a superb source of nutrients. There is a misconception that whole corn is used - in fact the corn is baked and is much like ground corn you buy. When cooked it is highly digestible.We hear many concerns about by-products in pet food. We need to understand how they are defined and what they really are and what is their nutrient value.<br />By-products is really a play on words. Virtually all ingredients in pet foods are by-products. No one for example uses real chicken breasts as we know it.It's neck and backs of a chicken.<br />Another common myth is that meat should always be the first ingredient, inferring that if that was the case, there would be more meat than anything else in the food. Often the carbohydrates levels are higher than the meats because of the way they are listed in the ingredient panel.Meat first is often the first ingredient only to please the consumer look st the ash levels and mositure levels, and ingreident spliting.<br /><br />I have fed Science Diet to my two dogs and I am very happy with the results. They love the food, it seems to have a good nutrient profile, my dogs have not had any gas or loose stool, in fact the clean up has been minimal so far, poop is much smaller and less of it that ever! I keep searching the yard with the scooper several times a day and there just isn't much to clean up! I can honestly say that they are going HALF as much as they were before! I never would have believed it, considering that there is a considerable amount of corn in these formulas.<br />My dogs were itching, had greasy coats and dandruff all at the same time! I was frustrated and worried for them...after a relatively short time, one of the dogs has virtually stopped itching and the other has decreased her itching intensity.<br /><br />I do wish the food was less expensive.

review/summary: Expected More...
review/text: I received my first bag via a coupon from BzzAgent, for free... since price was not a factor I was more than open to seeing positive changes. I really wanted to give this a high rating because our little mutt really seemed to like eating it and it is the perfect size but I did not notice any positive changes in her. By the same token, I did not notice any major negative changes either. However, the first few days she had diarrhea and after that it went back to almost normal consistency but she was pooping about twice as often. She was also thirsty all the time while eating this.<br /><br />I would say this food is average in quality, the pooch liked the taste but did not experience any of the claimed improvements so I do not think the price is justified. Others may have better luck with it but it just did not work better than our old food.
