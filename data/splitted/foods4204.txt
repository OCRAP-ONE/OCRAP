review/summary: Dog loves this food!
review/text: I have a two-year old Jack Russell Terrier and she loves Newman's Own Dog Food! She ate Beneful for a year before switching. This goes down much easier. She doesn't each eat it "just because she's hungry"; she actually likes it! I highly recommend this product and would consider giving any dog nothing less!

review/summary: Great product just need to adjust the subscription.
review/text: My two small dogs took to the food immediately so well in fact I have had to move up the subscription for the 12 pound bag. Since they are young its not immediate if they look healthier or bouncier as they seem to be that way all the time. What I have noticed is there business is allot more controlled and any problems such as regurgitation which I had in past products have gone away. If your a prime member I would suggest setting up a subscription and be rid of of the chore of last minute runs to buy dog food and also know you are giving your pets a quality tier of dog food.

review/summary: first rate dog food
review/text: Newman's Own has been an excellent choice for my dog. The ingredients are organic and high quality; her coat is beautifully conditioned and she has never had an allergic response as with some of the more expensive products from the vet's office. Also, she is a small dog and the kibble bits are easy for her to chew.  It was annoying that the price was reduced between the time of my order and the delivery, but Amazon made an immediate adjustment.  I like the 4-pound bags for freshness because my dog is small and takes awhile to eat that much, but there are other sizes available to suit larger dogs.

review/summary: My dog loves it!
review/text: I have a 3 year old Boston Terrier who is not only a picky eater, but most dog foods give him bad gas.  I searched high and low for several months for a dog food that would help with his stomach issues and finally found another brand of dog food that, while not organic, helped relieve the gas problem.<br />After finishing a bag of the old brand, I stumbled across this on amazon one cold day and thought I'd take a chance and see if he'd like it or not.  I'm happy to report that he loves it AND it doesn't give him horrible gas at all.  His coat is shiny and healthy, as well.  The only downside I can see--like the other brand--is the price.  But being that the product is high quality and organic, I can't argue that too much.  Plus, with amazon's subscribe and save, I get it at a discount and delivered right to my front door.  You definitely can't beat that!<br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with this and will continue to purchase.

review/summary: so good even a dog does not turn its nose up at it.
review/text: I bought this dog food initally because I like everything that I have tried from Newmans Products for humans. So, I thought that my Pug, Chloe may like Newmans also. Well, she sure does, there is no turning up her nose at it. I get it delivered regualry, so this negates the need to make a special trip to get Dog food.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/12/15  the last two bags I recieved had a mite in the foods which caused my dog to have severe bouts of diarrhea. I only found out today when I took her to the vet, and was informed that these intestinal bugs were usually located in the dog food. Sure enough, when I got home and looked in the dog food, guess what I cfound on the bottom of the bag, tiny mites.......it went out into the garbage containers.<br /><br />I will return to this dog food in a few months......she ahs liked it so much, but will wait for a bit.

review/text: and I love buying it for her. Not only is it a healthy organic meal, I personally like what the Newman Foundation does with their profits (after taxes) from their products.....$265 MILLION has been donated to various charities to date by their foundation. I buy Newman's Own products whenever I can (their spaghetti sauce is out-of-this-world..."Roasted Garlic"...YUM!).<br /><br />My dog has eaten this food for years and years until, out of the blue, my local grocer decided not to sell it anymore. I then had to grab a bag of food for her because we were out completely and decided to get Beneful. Apparently, her digestive system didn't like it and she ended up with bloody stools. That's when I came to Amazon.com (a GODSEND for people like me who have lame grocery stores to shop from) and found her Newman's Own dog food! I can always depend on Amazon.com. I've now got this on auto-delivery. I trust Newman's Own products and I know my dog is getting a well-balanced organic meal and it's Melamine-free.

review/summary: Best Dog Food Ever!
review/text: Newman's Own is the best dog food ever, in my opinion. My 12 year old white German Shepard eats and digests this food wonderfully. Before changing to this food a few years ago, she had digestive problems often, even though she was fed a "so called good brand name food".  My three year old pittie girl also eats this food, and loves it .. she is in perfect health. I would recommend it to anyone. My next door neighbor orders it now from Amazon for his pittie girl. Amazon is a wonderful place to purchase dog and cat food, groceries, and anything you need .. the prices are always good, and the specials are great! The specials are the best ever, and I was shocked to find out that a today "Friday" special price on Newman's Own dog food was automatically reflected in my subscribe and save item price of the Newman's Own.  Even though I just received a bag yesterday, I ordered two more today, and some Newman's Own cat food.  What other retailer would automatically do that for you .. none that I know of.  Amazon .. please continue to offer the Newman's Own dog food .. I would be lost without the delivery, since it is difficult for me to get out and shop and carry large items like bags of dog food.  Thank you for being here for me and Snowey and Sophie.<br />  Linda

review/summary: Great for dogs with allergies
review/text: I was giving my dogs Science Diet Puppy food from the time I got them at 8 weeks. Science Diet changed the formula about 3 months ago and the food just did not smell or look right. It was very oily and fishy smelling, which I realize they did at more fish oil. After about three weeks of the new food, I noticed my puppies (well now 1 year olds) skin was very flaky like dandruff and they both had been continuous licking their paws. I took them to the vet and he said they had food allergies. He wanted me to take them off the Science diet and put them on pumpkin and pinto beans for 7 weeks. Well, under duress I tried it and my dogs did not eat for 3 days. I decided to try the Newman's organic and after about 4 weeks their coat looks so much better and the licking has really decreased. I am so glad I saw this food when I was doing research.

review/summary: My Picky Cat LOVES this food!
review/text: I was advised to try this food by a worker at Petco when I was having difficulty finding wet cat food that my cat would like. His wet food 3oz per day would sit in his dish for hours with him only touching a little bit of it. It was a total waste of money for me.<br /><br />At first I was questioning the quality of the food because it was set in between the cheaper low supermarket brand cat foods instead of it being placed near the higher quality foods like Wellness, Natural Balanace, Blue Buffalo etc. The worker said.... "just try one 3oz can and see if your cat likes it." I looked at the ingredients and it looked like a pretty good food list. I asked her if it was made by Petco and she said "no."  I asked her if she knew who made it and she was not sure.  I am glad the other reviewer posted that it is made by the same company who manufactures<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70V0">Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> which has excellent reviews on Amazon. Finding this out makes me feel so much better about giving this food to my cat.  I give my cat a dry combo of Nature's Variety Rabbit Food with Blue Buffalo adult so I know he is getting great dry food in his system so I wasn't too worried about the wet not being up to the level of the dry as long as the food wasn't full of crappy stuff.<br /><br />Well I gave him him the Shrimp flavored one first the other day and he literally ate it in 3 or 4 minutes without stopping to take a break. I then went back to Petco to buy some more Shrimp and figured I should just try all of the flavors. Well, there wasn't much to choose from but I did buy as many flavors as was available. Apparently cat owners are getting told about this wonderful food and the stores are running low on it. I picked up the Chicken & Pumpkin(gone in 3 minutes again yesterday) as well as the Tuna in Gravy ( ate it this morning in less than no time) so I am really glad the Petco worker suggested this food to me. I am certain that my male Ragdoll will love the rest of the flavors too given how much he has loved 3 of them so far.<br /><br />The foods come either in a gelee or a gravy. My cat loves both forms of the wet cat food. The three cans I have opened so far two of them, the chicken and the tuna were both in a shaved meat form while the crab was not in a shaved form but I could see the pieces of crab in the food.  I couldn't not believe that I saw actually crab meat in this food!  I hate to tell more cat owners about this food in fear that the shelves will be completely empty when I need cat food but I just couldn't help spreading the good news about this new food I found.<br /><br />I would not hesitate trying this food. It seems to be a winner in my house!!

review/text: I was excited to try a blend of Jamaican blue coffee.  We had been there and loved the coffee but the pure beans are to difficult and expensive to get here.  I had tried another blend and was pleased but could not find that brand again so I tried this one.  Frankly it tastes awful.  Like the back end of a 5 pound tin of 4$ a pound coffee.  The flavor was harsh, stale and acidic without a hint of the the mellow chocolate notes that come with the Jamaican beans.  It was my first exposure to this brand and I will not try Jeremia's Pick coffee again.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I was disappointed in the flavor of this coffee. Frankly it does not compare with the true Blue Mountain Jamaican Coffee Beans which of course are much more expensive.  I have found the Eight O'Clock Columbian Whole Bean to be the best flavored for a reasonable price.  You can get it direct from the manufacturer on the Internet.

review/summary: Terrible Beans
review/text: I buy all sorts of whole beans to make espressos and lattes. I've been to the Blue Mountains, and the coffee is by far the best in the world. But it is the most expensive coffee too. I'll never buy a blend again, because you just don't know what they cut these beans with. This is just terrible coffee. Horrible. For a "gourmet" brand, they really screwed this one up. I'll stick to buying 100% Kona coffee in the future. I can't explain just how bad this bag of coffee is. I've had to blend it with stronger coffees just to drink it. On its own, it tastes like bad, bad diner coffee. It's not strong. It's really weak. Yet the bad taste is very strong. Ha. Just awful. Shame on you, Jeremiah.

review/text: Pretty OK coffee. Nothing special, but I suppose its a fair deal for the price. We picked up the pack of 3 as an emergency stash, and it has worked well for that, but its not my caffeine deliver system of choice ;-) Of course, my coffee of choice is over three times the cost of this stuff, so the comparison is not very fair.

review/text: If you're expecting these to taste exactly like regular, the difference will be more noticable.  However, if you are on a gluten free diet, you'll probably find that these chips offer a lot more flavor than some prior gluten free offerings. Instead of crackers, try these with chili or mexican dips.  Pretty tasty.

review/summary: good sale price
review/text: I bought these when they were on sale for boyfriend to go on his camping trip with his friends. They arrived well, no crushed bags or anything. The reason why I give it a three out of five is because I tried a bag and there is this very nasty metallic like taste on the inside of the bag where it was sealed. The actual chex mix was fine but if the mix or your fingers happened to touch that specific part of the bag then you would get a mouthful of that nasty taste. I asked my boyfriend when he got back to see if it was just my bag and he confirmed all of the bags were like that. I've never bought this before so I don't know if that's just the usual Chex Mix packaging or just the batch I bought. They mix was very good though but if I bought it again in the future with similar results I would cut off the top and repackage in a ziplock

Overall I think the parents were pleased and the kids loved the small party

review/text: What's better than brandy-filled chocolates? Well, yes, maybe a few things... But really, you'd be hard-pressed to stop nibbling on just one of these little delectables when they're sitting right in front of you. So that's probably why I don't buy them for myself; I give them as Christmas gifts. You see, around my house, they'd be gone tout de suite. But no one says that I can't sample one or two as they get passed around at someone else's Yuletide function! The only shortcoming to these little tins of tastiness is that there aren't nearly enough sweets in them! But, that's probably a good thing in the end, not only for one's teeth and waistline, but also for the drive home (they contain alcohol, after all!).

review/text: NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FROM THE 8-oz SIZE BOTTLE OF THE SAME COFFEE, SOLD BY AMAZON IN A CASE OF 2-OZ SIZES.  BUT...IT'S THE SAME COFFEE!!!!<br /><br />"Good To The Last Drop!" has been Maxwell House Coffee's 'signature line' for a very long time.  And, in the case of their regular instant coffee, it holds wonderfully true, even today!  (Probably for all the rest of their coffees, as well!!!!)<br /><br />I truly feel for the author of the previous review.  Maxwell House has changed the jar top (at least on the 8-ounce size).  It is now YELLOW, and the top has "Easy-To-Open" printed in blue letterings.  I don't know if they have done the same with the two-ounce size jar-top or not.  But I do know -- after many years of drinking Maxwell House Instant Coffee....first with a red metal screw-on top (with a lovely 5-pointed white star printed on it), and then to the familiar red plastic screw-on top, (no star printed on it) -- that, despite the jar being somewhat easier to open, (it has been approved by the American Arthritis Foundation), that I sorely miss the beautiful red screw-on lids that I grew up with.  (In fact, I KEPT the last one I was able to find....but, being plastic, it cracked and broke.  So, now I must use the new, easier-to-open, yet somehow not-as-inviting yellow-with-blue-lettering jar top, if I want to buy and use Maxwell House Instant Coffee.)<br /><br />If the new, blue top, is on the 2 oz size as well, I hope that my mention of it can help both you, and your grandmother, to find Maxwell House Instant, if you wish to!<br /><br />The good news is that the Coffee inside is the same as ever!  It is not the most "gourmet" of coffees.....but it does have a very nice flavour, if made correctly.  (TO MAKE GOOD INSTANT COFFEE....OF ANY BRAND....THE NUMBER ONE RULE IS: BOIL THE WATER A LOT!  You simply CANNOT over-boil water that you will later pour over instant coffee!  The longer you boil the water, the better-tasting INSTANT coffee will be.  One trick I learnt<br />to make the water boil longer...yet save on gas and electricity...is this:<br />Use a 2 or 3 quart SAUCEPAN to boil the water, NOT a tea-kettle.  Then, first, put in just enough water to cover the bottom...plus an extra ounce or two. Put the heat on high, and wait until the water STARTS to boil.<br />(With a glass pan, you can COVER the pan and make it boil even faster, thus saving even more gas or electricity.)  When the water just STARTS TO BEGIN TO BOIL, put in a bit more water.  When that water just starts to begin to boil, add more.  And so on...until you fill the pot with the right amount of water.  You have to be careful -- especially at the beginning -- NOT to let all the water boil out, or your pot will be ruined!  But if done correctly, this not only saves power, (as the smaller amounts of water, naturally, take less power to boil), but also boils the water far more than if you just put all the water in at once!<br />So, you get a better tasting cup of instant coffee....and also help preserve the planet, at the same time !  : )  (This method of boiling water is NOT recommended for tea, however.  Tea needs water that has been boiled, yes...but boiled as LITTLE as possible. Indeed, I have read, (in "The Little Princesses", by Marion Crawford, which I have also reviewed for Amazon.com -- that Queen Mary, herself, used to wait until the water for HER tea had JUST started to boil, before using it for tea.<br />(I guess this boiling water LESS for tea, can help save natural resources, too!)<br /><br />The main thing I want to say, of course, is that MAXWELL HOUSE INSTANT COFFEE has a wonderful flavour, especially if you make it with REALLY boiled water!  It is the least-expensive of brand name instant coffees...and gives a nice, invitingly-flavoured cup of coffee!  If you like, you can always mix it with other, more expensive instant, (or even regular) coffees....but it's great all by itself.<br /><br />If you want a great tasting cup of instant coffee, yet want to save money, and yet still again, NOT buy a "store brand" instant coffee, then MAXWELL HOUSE INSTANT COFFEE is for you!  It is, and always has been,<br />"Good To The Last Drop!"<br /><br />P.S.:  I still yearn, however, to taste Maxwell House's more varied regular ground coffees in instant form.  Please, Maxwell House...treat your instant-coffee customers to "1897" Coffee, and the other types of Maxwell House ground coffee, in instant form.  I predict they will all be an "instant hit" with customers!

review/summary: not the right coffee
review/text: i ordered this coffee as a gift for my grandma that is almost 83 and can't see well at all, because she can't find this coffee with the red label anymore in any store. i serched everywhere and found it on here. she lives 90 miles away so i had it sent to her house. she got it about 5 days later and opened it and made a cup of coffee. she said it didnt taste right so when i saw her over x-mas she brought it to me and it was in a blue label and wasn't the original that i ordered. so either maxwell house changed the coffee taste or the wrong kind was sent. the picture was in the red label like grandma always bought and thats why i bought it for her and i was very upset after spending 35.00 to find out it wasn't the right kind. i dont think i will ever buy from this company again due to the fact that it wasn't the right coffee that was sent.

review/summary: My Dog Loves This Food!!
review/text: I was using Organix for a while, and was happy with the ingredients, and my dog seemed to enjoy it. Then I saw all the great reviews for Newman's Own Organic Dog Food, along with the great price, and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />They say that it takes a dog a while to get used to a new food, but I have to tell you: from the first day I gave him the Newman's Own, he REFUSED to eat the Organix anymore, he loved the Newman's Own so much - even though he'd eaten the Organix for years! I even tried mixing the bit of Organix I had left in with the Newman's Own. But he would just pick out the pieces and leave them on the floor next to his bowl.<br /><br />So, I don't know what it is, but my dog sure seems to love this food! He's eating more now and he's very healthy.<br /><br />Again, I had no complaints about the Organix. I think it's probably a good dog food. But my dog sure prefers the Newman's Own!!

review/summary: My picky dog LOVES this stuff!
review/text: I have a 11 yr old Pomimo (1/2 Pomeranian, 1/2 American Eskimo) who seems to only like human food. Although I'd love to give him human food all the time, I know it's not good for his digestive system, and it doesn't have the proper nutrients required for a dog, especially at his current age. Upon trying various brands including Blue and Call of the Wild, I couldn't justify the price in comparison to how little my dog liked the taste. After reading some positive reviews here on Amazon for Newman's, I decided to give it a go. Surprisingly, my dog started eating the food immediately after I poured some into his dish. He never does that with other dry dog food, and usually waits to eat after I've given him a nibble of everything that I eat during the day. What makes it even better is the reasonable price for the quality. Yes, I understand that organic and quality US-made food are naturally more expensive, however some of the brands charge double of Newman's and provide only half the taste. As humans, we're usually sold by the nutritious & wholesome advertisements when buying dog food, however I think its pretty important for my dog to actually like the taste of the food also. Newman's seems to be the ticket for both nutrition and taste. Will be buying Newman's as a regular!

This is one of only a few brands that is corn free and it cured the teary eye problem quickly.  BLUE brand does not contain corn, but they include garlic in their blend which can cause kidney problems in dogs over time according the veteriniarian.  It smells more natural than Purina One which I had been feeding them and they seem to like it better.  I like that the sales from the food go to charity too.  A good product.

They have been eating Newman's advanced dog formula for active or senior dogs for 18 months now and have not tired of it. Their skin and mobility has improved and they love it. I buy it by subscription so we never have to worry about running out and it is the cheaper way to purchase. My local stores only sell small bags which is an expensive way to buy.

review/text: Received in a timely manner and in good condition. My Mishka is a little spoiled (I cook her meals when I can afford it, buy her wellness kibble when I can't) but she ate this willingly. I bought this because it qualified for overnight shipping, unlike the much heavier wellness bag, and she was almost out of kibble. I'm happy with the compromise.

review/summary: Great product, my dogs love it!
review/text: I buy Newmans Own adult dog food for my two chihuahuas.  I've always fed them natural, human-grade dog food, even though most brands can be a bit pricey.  Like most pet parents, I try to do the best I can for my dogs which starts with feeding them right.  Most dog food can be disgusting and the practices behind it are disturbing.  Newmans Own is more affordable, and I feel good about the company's ethics and practices so it was worth a try.<br /><br />My dogs love it so it was easy to switch from the other brand.  They gobble it up! I now have it on subscription so we don't run out.

review/summary: Dogs Love It
review/text: I read all the reviews before buying this food and overall I was impressed with the product myself.  The dogs like it, they have no ill effects as 1 reviewer alleged (looking at her other reviews I think hers should be tossed by Amazon) and I can get it for even less on a subscription with Prime which means 2 Day No Cost shipping.  Whats not to love?  I do mix this with some Prescription Diet J/D since I have one "older' dog and 1 with some allergies and the combo seems to help.  Bottom Line:  It is a good product and after doing a ton of reading (I don't buy my animals cheap food or ANYTHING that I think comes from China) I think it does everything it claims.

review/text: This is a great product. Very comforting for owners that it is all natural (and mostly organic) with no by products and preservatives.<br /><br />We gave our dog (a 7 year old lab mix) PetPromise before. After the transition it took a couple of days for her to get used to it, but once she did she loves it. My dog is quite picky about her food and she likes "junk food" better rather than wholesome food and treats (of course!). She is very used to Newman's own now and it gives her very good bowl movement. Always a plus!

review/text: I've always given my dog what I thought was high quality dog food since she was a puppy.  After the pet food issues of a few years ago I switched to only organic dog food for her.  Since she is only 10 lbs the price difference isn't too bad.  I am a free feeder which isn't ideal but means my dog basically has access to food any time she wants it.  Because of this she only gets really excited when "people" food is offered to her.  Well when I open this bag she comes over and eats asap.  Good enough for me!

review/text: I expected Newman's Own dog food to be great.  It may be very nutritious, but my little terriers told me, "We are NOT eating this stuff.  Period.  No Way."  After 3 days they sniffed their bowls and walked away.  So I ordered another organic dog food (Natural Balance Organics) and it came today.  So, half old, half new, by the book, and they picked out the new stuff and left the Newman's in the bowl.  Go figure.  Just thought some of you might like to know.  I am switching them from Iams to something much healthier and I finally think I have a match.  But it's not Newman's.

They found Ethoxyquin on it - a pesticide. [...] I just want to make sure if someone out there has the same problem, that it must be known. I'm still not happy about this incident. I decided not to pursue it any longer, but I still feel people should know. These 'Organic' companies can't get away misleading people. If everyone exposed them, then this would be a better world.

review/summary: Grains don't belong in dog food
review/text: I will never again even CONSIDER a dog food with corn, wheat or soy in it. Grain has no place in a dog's diet!

review/summary: Newman's Own Organics Dog Food
review/text: I cannot express enough how pleased I am with this dog food. I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding.  For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems.  Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food.  After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me.  Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is.  I do spoil my fur kids, but their health and well being is my number one priority.  I have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats Newman's Own cat food, both dry and canned food, and since then, I have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair balls.  I know that I am truly a pet lover, but I believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them, unnecessary medical issues, and all around good health, a good balanced, safe, natural food is the way to go.  I highly recommend Newman's Own dog and cat food.  I also feed my two dogs Newman's Own biscuits as treats.

review/summary: Give it time
review/text: I adopted a dog that was raised by a bunch of frat age boys.  You can imagine the diet she had; Burgers, fries, ice-cream, and the cheapest dog foods on the market.<br /><br />No, she wasn't crazy about Newman's dog food when I switched her to it.  But if you think about how people react to a healthy diet in the beginning it makes sense.  It takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there.<br /><br />It has been almost a year.  My dog, Molly, is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free. She gets dry Newman's fed free style, and 4 ounces of Newman's canned every day.  Her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her. Her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week.<br /><br />On another note, this diet has made doggy duty much easier. She never vomits anymore. Her scat is always firm, making her easy to clean up after.  She is regular as clock-work.  All these plusses make it more enjoyable to be a dog owner.
