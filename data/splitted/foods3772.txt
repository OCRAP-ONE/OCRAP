review/summary: Fabulous flavor!
review/text: This is the syrup they use to make white chocolate hot chocolate and various drinks at Cinnabon.  Since moving to AZ, I have not been able to find a Cinnabon location that sells anything with "white" chocolate--so I started searching on my own for it!  Shipping was very fast, and when I purchased the bottle, I did NOT have to buy a separate pump--it came with one.  Pump is well constructed.  I have had zero problems with it sticking or not pumping the proper amount of syrup.  I have also had several friends over to enjoy and they just raved. Yum!

review/summary: Disappointing results
review/text: I found this sauce to be underwhelming in flavor, all sweetness with a less than lovely aftertaste.  I tried smaller and smaller amounts in my espresso and could never get a comparable result to using the ghiradelli chips.  Also, the companion pump didn't keep it's prime and had to be pumped several times to be reprimed every day and so the amount released was inconsistent which made it difficult to "measure" easily.  (1 pump, 1/2 pump, etc)<br />One ounce in an espresso was VERY strong and not pleasant, and a half ounce is just sweet without a white mocha flavor.

review/summary: Just like Starbucks, in my opinion
review/text: I find very little difference at all between this and Starbucks. Perhaps it's because I gave up Starbucks when I gained the ability to make these at home and the comparison isn't there for me anymore? not sure, but really, I found this to be highly comparable with Starbucks.  It's not too sweet either.<br /><br />I've ordered a few of the 64 oz bottles and something I don't like is that when they arrive, the bottoms are bowed out and they don't sit squarely on the table.  I was weary at first because sometimes when products go bad, the packaging becomes misshaped but I went ahead and used it and all 3 containers had perfectly fine/safe contents.

review/summary: COST OF PUMP IS MORE ?
review/text: Chocolate is great for my morning mochas, but seriously to charge extra for the pump is obsurd, luckily i live near Ghiradelli so go buy it directly from the sorce an everytime they include free pump, i mean seriously how else are you supposed to use it ?  though have washed pump an placed in each new bottle.  An price is cheaper directly from the source so if you live in or are visitng San Francisco go visit Ghiradelli but if not just remember take the pump apart an wash it so you don't have to buy new ones each time you buy the syrup.

review/summary: The only oats I use
review/text: I am gluten intolerant and make my own granola, so this pack of 4 arrangement is handy and less expensive than buying single packages off the shelf at my health store.  It is good quality, as all Bob's products are.  Honestly, I can't taste any difference from the regular oats.  I think it only amounts to Bob's using a separate mill for this product than he uses for his regular oats.

review/summary: Excellent old fashion Italian raw food that tastes super
review/text: -These kind of cold cured meat products never go over 100 degree in Fahrenheit, yet for 1000's of years this process preserves meat and while retaining all the nutrition and enzymes of raw. It tastes just awesome like a beef prosciutto.<br />-Prosciutto, ham is salted and then air dried for a period of up to two years. After curing, prosciutto is sliced into paper thin pieces which are usually slightly transparent. It is typically eaten uncooked.<br />-I have a Mandolin slicer that I use to shave the Bresaola very thin. Watch out very addictive with cheese and crackers. Maybe some wine too.

review/summary: Just like in Italy
review/text: I purchased Daniele Bresaola about a year ago for the first time and was very skeptical. The item arrived very well packaged in a sealed bag and with an ice pack. Since then I have ordered it 4 more times, the quality of the product is excellent. Sometimes the amount of salt added differs, but generally the quality is similar to italian. I first tried bresaola in Italy, so I know what it is supposed to taste like. The only recommendation I have is slicing it with a professional knife very thin. This makes the meat easier to digest and you would fully enjoy each single slice.

review/text: I absolutely LOVE Stokes Green Chile Sauces, but I'm not about to pay $5.14 for one can!  That's outrageous!  Go down to Wal-Mart and buy a can for only $3.00.  Whether you buy the sauce with chicken in it, or my favorite, with pork, it's worth the price.  I mix a can of this sauce with a can of refried beans (my fav is Rosarita) and spoon it over tostadas or Indian fry bread.  Top with lettuce, tomato, and shredded cheddar cheese and wow!  Delicious!!!<br /><br />By the way, WHEN did the Hatch Chile Co. acquire the Stokes brand?  They'd better not change anything...although Hatch DOES make the best red enchilada sauce on the planet.

I carefully pick through the slab for seeds and then put it into a sealed container in the fridge for later use or just to eat sweetened with some honey.<br /><br />All brands of 'seedless' paste in blocks like this that I've tried have seeds. I don't understand why they label it seedless? Someone could break a tooth or wreck their food-processor blades if they didn't know better!

review/summary: Not quite "dried" peppers...
review/text: I dehydrate many types of peppers and then use a coffee grinder to make a powder out of them.  I was expecting to be able to do that with these peppers, but they are not dry enough for that.  They are closer in texture to the dried apricots you buy to eat out of hand.  Sort of leathery and pliant.<br /><br />Not a big problem, as I just plopped them on the dehydrator for a day until they were brittle/rock hard, and then ground them up.  As a precaution, I set the dehydrator outside on the deck to avoid the fumes.  They smell incredible -- a lot like chipotle peppers, actually.  I tasted just a tiny bit of some of the outer skin, and it was quite hot.  I'm sure with the seeds and veins included when ground, it's going to be flaming.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of rope fibers mixed in with the peppers, but I didn't mind this, as it reminded me that these were dried the old fashioned way - by tying and hanging them up.  It just took a little time to pull these threads off as I was placing them on the dehydrator trays.  I probably could have not bothered with that and just ground up the fibers with the peppers.<br /><br />I'll add to this review when I find out exactly how much "one pound" of these peppers actually weighs when properly dried.

review/summary: Great peppers and hot.
review/text: Maybe I just got a good batch, but the heaping pound of peppers I received are extremely hot, hottest I've ever tasted, and make amazing chili powder too.<br /><br />There is also a strong smoky, mesquite, jerky, sweet flavor to go along with them.<br /><br />If you are watching the guys on youtube eating bhut jolokia(ghost chile) and expect a similar experience you're sadly mistaken.  These are dried peppers, and while still very spicy, they are unlikely to retain the same bite of a fresh pepper.  Especially since you don't have to chew the pepper very much.  Also those people are acting for dramatic effect, who wants to see a guy take down the hottest pepper in the world without any flair.<br /><br />I'm very satisfied with my order and plan to try growing my own this summer.

review/summary: Baja South of the Border Contest
review/text: Recently my friend took a few samples of the Salsa that I make with Habanero peppers to a Chili contest in Mexico.I also entered a new  salsa made with Bhut Jolokia peppers and a basic traditional recipe and is quite good. To my  surprise the Habanero salsa won First Place and my new found "Fantasma Bhut Jolokia Salsa"  won Third place. I was very excited and also it made me want to experiment more with the new found pepper Bhut Jolokia, My entrees were a Mild Fantasma at about 90,000-150,000 scoville units and a X-tra Hot Fantasma at about 150,000 to 350,000 scoville-units. As you can see I have used just a portion of it's potency but I'll keep you posted on any new developments arising from this new venture in Bhut-Jolokia pepper fever. Thanks to Angelina's Gourmet you've made my day and your pepper selection is great. Yours Truly  AL

review/summary: HOTTTTTT
review/text: I want to thank Angelinas Gourmet for these HOTTT Bhut Jolokias and for Angelinas fast shipping. I ordered a pound of dried peppers and was not disappointed. Angelina's Gourmet has the best prices on the internet. For those who are saying these Bhuts are not hot are sadly mistaken. I grow and eat Habaneros, Bhut Jolokias, Tepins, Japones chilis and Jalapenos and know what hot is<br /><br /> Here are some ideas for everyone to try. Cook these peppers in soup or anything liquid base and you will notice the heat. You can also break the peppers in half and suck on the side with the stem, seeds and flesh. That is when you will feel the full potential of the heat of these peppers. Plus you can saute these pepppers with some olive oil and peppers and the heat will be noticeable as well.<br /><br /> I am satisified with this product and plan on buying more. I went through a 1lb bag already because I have been given them away for people to try. I am a well satisified customer and thank you for these hot Bhut Jolokias.

review/summary: Ghost Chilis
review/text: This is going to read like another ad for the company, but rarely have I been so completely satisfied by a product. I was specifically looking for dried bhoot jalokia (ghost) chilis that I could grind myself for a variety of uses. I had never purchased from this company before and was concerned that the peppers would be leathery and not really dry enough for my grinders to work correctly. No worries! These chilis were exactly what I was looking for. They were perfectly dried and I was able to grind them very easily into the different consistencies that I need for my various uses (jerky, salsas, etc.) The peppers are first rate: the flavor is awesome - the perfect intense flavor and incredible heat. It is obvious that they started out with only the finest fresh chilis and dried them to perfection. Not only that, but the delivery was faster than promised and the packaging was excellent as the peppers arrived in perfect condition. There is no question where I will go when I need to replenish my supply. If you need perfectly dried chilis of the highest possible quality, look no farther. You will NOT be disappointed.

One of our most loyal customers, for whom we made a sauce with habanero chilies as a base, wanted smoething hotter.  We have finally achieved his dream of a sauce that has both real flavor and heat.

review/summary: As hot as advertised!
review/text: I've always loved hot, spicy food, and after hearing about the Ghost Chili on "Man vs. Food," I decided I had to check them out.  Did some research on the internet, including watching videos of people eating dried Ghost Chilis, and still thought "no way are they that much hotter than a Habenero."  They are.  So hot, in fact, that the huge bag of dried Bhut Jolokai peppers I recieved in the mail is enough to last for years- a half-teaspoon of the dried peppers ground up is enough to make a huge pot of chili very hot, the same amount in a container of home-made salsa renders it un-edible by all but a very few "hot-heads."  Smoky and spicy at the same time, it has a heat that builds a little slower than other hot peppers and lingers longer, with a definite sinus-clearing component and a catch in your throat.  For super spicy food lovers only, be careful when handling them as well.

review/text: Since I purchased these primarily for the heat, I too am disappointed: When I said "you gotta try these" to some heat seekers, they were likewise unimpressed for the scoville thrill.<br /><br />However, all of us agreed these really are some very flavorful peppers and a few of those heat seekers will be buying them on that virtue.<br /><br />UPDATE: After cleanup some up and simmering in water for a couple hours, I made a paste from the pulp, reserving the liquid.  Both retained the smokey taste but the heat became quite a bit more impressive. Still, the heat was less than a habanaro though.<br /><br />The crowd now wants to use it in chili for a cook-off. It is great on Pizza.

review/summary: Where's the heat?
review/text: These peppers are supposed to rate at over 1 million Scoville units; that's almost 3x hotter than a Scotch Bonnet habenero. Maybe it's just me, these peppers seem to be lacking that good old capsaicin. Don't ask me why, but these don't seem to rate anywhere near the orange Havana habaneros I normally cook with.<br /><br />On the bright side, these definitely convey the smokey flavor that the Jolokia is famous for. This stuff is exceedingly good crushed on pizza, on jerky, or pureed into barbecue sauce. Still, true lovers of that caliente feeling will probably wonder where all that legendary fire went to.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: At first this tea may sound like a strange combination, this mostly can be summed into one question: chocolate TEA? I was apprehensive, but all the flavors are appealing separately, so why not put them together? I love Revolution Tea, I always find them to have to freshest, most flavorful tea. I even bought expensive loose leaf tea and it wasn't nearly as good as Revolution Tea. Revolution never seemed to disappoint me, so even though I didn't know what to make of this flavor, I decided to try it anyway.<br /><br />I'm glad I did try it! This tea is absolutely AMAZING! The main flavor is the green tea, with a hint of citrus and the smoothness of chocolate! The aroma's the best part; it smells just like warm chocolate! I took it to work and shared it with my coworkers and they loved it as well! They always ask if I have more with me!<br /><br />If you like green tea and chocolate, TRY THIS TEA! It's my new favorite and I always keep at least 3 boxes at home now!

review/text: The combination of chocolate and orange in a green tea is different and exciting. It is still green tea, but the accents are there. It is good with or without a sweetener added. It is good both cold (iced) or hot. It is also double sealed with a reclosable zip-lock top so it doesn't get stale sitting unopened in the box or opened. The servings are generous. The bags are not the usual fine paper teabags, so it brews better although there will be more "dust" in the teapot because of that.

review/summary: Bewley's (and Barry's too) are my favorites.
review/text: This blend was my first experience drinking Bewley's tea.  I found that I liked it very much.  Loved it,that is.  There was one cup of it that I felt was probably the best tea I'd EVER tasted, but I've never been able to duplicate the flavor of that one cup!  --Have found that my tea is best if I make it in a pot instead of a cup and carefully follow basic classic good tea-making instructions, i.e., pour boiling water in the pot to prepare it beforehand, then when tea-water is boiling, pour out the hot water from the teapot, put in tea-bags (1 to each 8 ounces of water), pour in the boiling tea-water, place the lid, let steep 4 or 5 minutes.  It seems that Tea made in a pot comes out mellower, less harsh-tasting than in a cup.  Still, I keep getting different flavor results with each different pot of tea I make.  Very mysterious problem.  Maybe I need to time the process precisely with each cup or batch and note down the results of each different timing, then see if the timing produces a consistent result every time.<br /><br />(I used to flavor my tea with honey, but now I prefer Xylitol sugar substitute which is mild but satisfying, has less calories, and possibly is healthier.)<br /><br />I also love Barry's Tea.  Both Bewley's and Barry's are my super-favorites.  (Not available in my grocery so am happy that I can order both brands through Amazon and can get super-saver no-shipping-fee.)

review/summary: 80 Count Box, Excellent Breakfast Tea
review/text: I hope Amazon changes the heading from 30 to 80 count; this price for 30 count would be ridiculous.<br /><br />My doctor directed switching from coffee to tea.  He is no longer my physician but I began with Twinnings Irish and English breakfast teas; finally, I found Bewley's.  My breakfast tea style emerged into drinking one batch of 2 bags of Irish breakfast tea, for its strength, followed by using one bag of English breakfast tea an hour later.  Today I use Dublin morning tea-bags, 2 then 1 of course.  It falls in between these two breakfast tea types, slightly milder than Irish but perceptibly stronger than English...and still smooth.<br /><br />The physician made an erroneous assumption about my coffee habit.  I had only been drinking 6 ounces every morning, for years; occasionally decaf cappuccino after dinner.  He probably would have not recommended the switch to tea.  I am happy to have found a strong excellent tea, and have been on Bewley's for a year.  It is smoother and stronger than Twinnings, in my opinion, and about the same price.  A winner all around.<br /><br />If you drink your coffee as espresso, cappuccino, or french press, you will appreciate this strong smooth tea.

review/summary: Former morning coffee drinker gives 5 stars for new brew.
review/text: A while back, I began drinking hot tea instead of coffee in the mornings to cut down on the "jitters" I get from the latter.  Now, I'm the type of person who doesn't take on new habits lightly.  So I began trying many popular brands and blends to try and decide which I like best.  Included were blends from Twinings, PG Tips, Barry's, Bigelow, Taylors of Harrogate, Devonshire Tea, Celestial, and (of course) Bewley's.  Of all the blends I've tried, Bewley's Dublin Morning Tea is by far my favorite.  I don't miss drinking coffee every morning, but actually crave this tea instead.<br /><br />Bewley's Dublin Morning Tea is a very robust tea, somewhat similar to an Irish Breakfast blend in my opinion.  I enjoy it with sugar and milk.

review/summary: Best brand so far
review/text: The Feline Organizational Committee in my house has informed its employee that this is an acceptable product. They previously complained about everything except Natural Value with Albacore and this one. You do not want to be in this house when they are complaining.<br />As for my research, so far as I know there are no additives. This company does not fool around with the product or try to make it pretty for me or stretch it with inedible filler. They provide real fish and real crab (in a small amount of clear fishy jelly). That's fine with me. I don't want additives that make things colorful and eventually kill my cats. I don't want to look at it, they don't see in color, and all they want to do is smell it and eat it. And when they are happy, I am sooo relieved. Keep up the good work!

review/summary: Our picky cats love this food.
review/text: They are not so wild about the pate style flavors but all of the red meat tuna topped with something (crab, mackerel, etc.) are the most successful selections we have ever had in our household.  We used to feed them only dry food, having been advised by a vet long ago this was better for their teeth.  Recently, our vet who is a dental specialist has revised that opinion, saying that cat teeth are not designed for the kind of crushing most dry food requires, and may lead to dental disease and breakage in cats with vulnerable mouths.  So we have switched to wet food, requiring considerable trial and error to find a brand they would accept, and we're happy with Natural Value's healthy ingredients.

review/text: I give my kitty this every once in a while as a treat but I don't make this his main meal because he's prone to bladder crystal formation and fish tends to make it worse.<br /><br />This is VERY fishy tuna and you need to transfer whatever you don't use into another container because the metal container will make the fish taste like metal if you try to save it in the original can (which is pretty gross).<br /><br />My cat DOES love this stuff but he gets bored of it if I give him too much and then he gives it the ol' "paw-shake flip-off".<br /><br />His favorite feast by this company is the chicken pate which I mix with organic pumpkin and he loves that.<br /><br />Here's to all of our kitties living long and happy lives!

review/summary: Great price for a truly healthy product
review/text: I love this pineapple.  Right now Amazon's price is pretty comparable to what I pay at Costco for this.  My problem with a lot of fruit snacks is you think you are getting something healthy, but the way they process it makes it not so.  This product is truly healthy!  It is organic and it is not processed with sulphur.  I think it tastes amazing!  It is sweet and juicier than any dried pineapple I've ever had.  Yes, it is not going to drip with juice because it is DRIED pineapple, but it is definitely moist and tasty.  It is a bit brown, but isn't that to be expected?  This is an organic, all natural product that is actually good for you.  If that is what matters to you, get this.  If you care more about looks and cosmetic features of your food, then I'd recommend going the sulphur route where your pineapple will look super pretty but be more unhealthy.

So many dried pineapple snacks contain sugar, but these don't, they're just natural dried pineapple. I love the taste and the convenience. The only problem I've encountered is that I need to put a handful in a small bowl before I start eating. If I eat them right out of the bag it's too tempting to just finish the whole bag!

review/summary: Okay, but not nearly as good as whole fruit
review/text: I really like whole fruit pineapple and usually eat about two pineapples per month.  This is the first time that I have tried dried pineapple.  Overall, I was unimpressed with this product.  Since this is the first time that I have had dried pineapple, I cannot say if my disappointment is because of this particular brand or not.  I expected a stronger burst of pineapple taste, but this product was relatively bland.  I was also surprised that this dried fruit was less sweet-tasting than I expected, even though it is highly concentrated in sugar (as are all dried fruits).  The individual pieces are relatively soft and small.  They are also sticky, such that there was essentially one large mass of pieces stuck to together when the bag was first opened.  The individual pieces can be separated easily.

Since we only drink decaf in the evenings we finally gave up wasting our money until my husband came across Mount Hagen in a grocery store.

review/text: There are many claims for best instant coffee, and I have tried many of the top priced brands.  The Mount Hagen brand, both decaf and caffeinated, is excellent.  Sometimes, I do not have the time to grind fresh beans, and I have sent a lot money trying various top end brands.  A little disheartened with The result, so many lack a good solid and smooth coffee taste, I actually bought a box of the 25 sachets rather than a jar.  And boy was I shocked to discover that both the decaf and caffeinated were excellent.  In fact, the decaffeinated had just the right strong and smooth flavor of excellent ground coffee beans: one would have thought you just ground them and it did not taste watery or weak.  I kid you not.  The amazon save and subscribe is a great price!  Thank you.

review/text: I really like this decaf. As others have mentioned, it is very smooth. I really love that it is organic. I drink quite a bit of decaf because I love coffee but cannot handle caffeine more than once per day.<br /><br />Here is my only issue with this coffee. It is a *very* light roast. If you like a darker roasted coffee, or even slightly dark roasted coffee, this is not the one for you. This is considered a "city roast", which is very light. Even if it were slightly darker, I would buy it again. As it is, I probably will not buy it again because there are a few other options out there. I thought that I would mention this because it is difficult to tell from the photo.

review/summary: Not too shabby
review/text: This is a pretty darn good freeze-dried coffee. As it's the only organic decaffeinated freeze-dried that I'm aware of, there's not much to compare it to aside from good quality drip coffee. My only qualm with it, is the cap. Flimsy plastic that snaps on, instead of twists on, which doesn't seem like it'll keep any air out of the jar. I'm hoping the coffee doesn't end up tasting stale in a few weeks. Another thing to keep in mind is that the serving recommendation for one cup is 1 leveled teaspoon, which definitely isn't enough (leaves the coffee tasting watered-down). I'd recommend 1.5 tsps, which leaves the coffee tasting pretty solid, though the servings per jar then drop from 60 to 40. I'd definitely consider purchasing this product again, and luckily, with this bulk order, that won't have to be for another 6 months!

review/text: Warm, rich, deeply satisfying -- that is what Mount Hagen Organic Freeze-Dried Instant Decaffeinated Coffee tastes like!  A strong brew, but not overly so, with just a hint of sweetness!  Totally superb -- this is COFFEE!  Additional benefits, of course, are<br />that it is instant coffee, decaffeinated, and organic.  But....mmmm!  That taste!  Totally terriffic!  (I bought only one jar somewhere else -- it went SO fast!  The "six-pack" here on Amazon is a great idea!)<br /><br />P.S.:  For the BEST taste in ANY instant coffee, let the water boil as LONG as possible.  For the best taste in any TEA, let the water boil for as SHORT a time as possible.  (In her books on the British Royal Family, Marion Crawford reports how Queen Mary would stand at the tea kettle, and take it off as SOON as it started to boil.  For tea.  But for a truly "royal treat" in Instant Coffee, my suggestion is to this scrumptious Mount Hagen Decaffeinated Freeze-Dried instant.  I son't think a better decaffeinated instant can be found anywhere!

review/summary: The best.
review/text: I don't care much for the "Caffeine Buzz", since I don't really feel it. So, I drink coffee for the taste of it. Naturally, I drink decaf -- it's healthier, and again, why have caffeine if you don't benefit from it anyway? I read about Mount Hagen about 2 months ago -- and that's how long I've been drinking it. The taste is very close to a good brewed coffee and ten times better than a gas-station-grade one. I use more than "one level teaspoon" per cup, as I'm sure most people do -- it's a decaf, isn't it?;)<br /><br />I just bought 6-jar pack for an unbelievable price, with the current Amazon promo + free shipping. But I'd buy it with or without discount -- that's how good it is. The funny thing is, when you just open a jar, it doesn't smell nearly as delicious as any of it's competitors. Than you put a heaping spoon of it in the cup and poor boiling water on top... As a matter of fact, I'm about to do it now!<br /><br />Peace.

review/summary: Best Instant Decaf Out There
review/text: As someone who loves high-quality freshly ground coffee, I'm pretty hard to please when it comes to instant. While I can't say this is as good as an expensive, high-quality, freshly ground, brewed coffee, I can certainly say that it is better than any of the store brands of pre-ground brewed coffee! That's pretty hard to find in an instant coffee -- let alone DECAF instant. This is an excellent replacement for brewed coffee when you're in a hurry or you just want to make 1 cup. (And it tastes better than most K-Cups so there's no need to buy an expensive machine that brews single cups.) I use a bit more per serving than it says in order to have a very robust and flavorful cup of coffee.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about Mount Hagen is the cap on the jar. It snaps on rather than screws on, which doesn't create a tight seal. Because this is freeze-dried, the coffee does stay fresh even without the tight seal, but I usually like to reuse old jars and it's a shame that I have to recycle these otherwise nice, square glass jars.

review/summary: Really, No One Will Believe You Didn't Brew It
review/text: This is a superb instant decaf:  taste and smell are superb.  No bitter notes.  No "chemically" decaf taste or formaldehyde--it's naturally decaffeinated via a carbon dioxide process.  It's organic, and it tastes like it.  Mellow, deeply colored, and delicious.<br /><br />Another great feature is that you can make each cup to just the right intensity for every drinker's preference (I keep a small teaspoon-sized scoop in the container).  My husband jokes that I like nothing but what he calls "Cajun coffee" (brewed black, hot, and strong) while he likes his with a lighter touch.  Nice to both be able to enjoy our coffee together, without ever having to brew a pot just to "water it down."<br /><br />I've secretly served it to some friends who are fellow coffee snobs.  They never noticed the difference & one actually argued that it couldn't possibly be either decaf or instant--he would know.  Without a doubt.  So Wrong!<br /><br />This is a great German import--you've got to taste it to believe it & Amazon's Subscribe & Save price is excellent.  A great find!

review/summary: Disappointed after all the great reviews
review/text: After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to take the plunge and get a case of the Mount Hagen Instant Decaf. My first cup was a weird experience...wasn't sure if I made it wrong or if it had gone stale. Opened another jar and it was the same; weak, flavorless coffee, almost like drinking tea. The only things I liked about the coffee are that 1) it's organic and 2) it has ZERO aftertaste or bitter finish. I tried doubling and tripling the amounts and then it just tasted like sludge. If you like a weaker coffee or are coming from old-school instant, then this would be a good choice. Even my wife (who is more of a tea drinker) commented on how smooth, but extremely bland this coffee is.<br /><br />I prefer a stronger cup of coffee (not darker; my preference is a french-press medium roast from freshly ground beans). I guess back to VIA it is. I despise most of Starbuck's coffee, but VIA is surprisingly good.

I couldn't find this coffee locally, so I thought I would try it through Amazon. It has good flavor.  If you like it stoong, just use more.  I would buy this again.  This seems to be a little bit expensive over other decaf instant brands -- thus the reason for only 4 stars.

review/summary: Perfect Organic Instant Coffee
review/text: I love Mount Hagen instant coffee, both the regular and the decaf!  I have been drinking Mount Hagen for several years.  I started with the regular and when I got pregnant, I switched to decaf.  It makes wonderful iced coffee and I love being able to make a fresh glass of iced coffee without having to make a whole pot of coffee.  The decaf is freeze dried, so it doesn't have the chemicals in it that most decaf coffee has.  I highly recommend Mount Hagen and the decaf is perfect for those who are avoiding caffeine.  I really can't even tell a difference in taste between the decaf and the regular.  Both are rich, robust, pure, and flavorful!  Perfect!
