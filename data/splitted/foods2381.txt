review/text: This is the only brand I've had of spearmint tea, but I have no reason for complaint! It's one of the smoothest tasting teas I've ever had. While it would be nice to have string handles on the tea bags, I understand why they don't, so I'm okay with it. The bag tends to inflate with air and float on top so it's easy to grab with my fingers without getting them burned.

review/summary: Excellent tea, consistent quality
review/text: I've ordered multiple cases of this tea now from Amazon and I've been completely satisfied every time. Each case has arrived without damage and perfectly intact.<br /><br />This tea has a great "grassy" lemongrass bite to it, that you could describe as a mild bitterness. I think this lemongrass flavor really compliments the strong earthy green tea flavors of the tea itself. You can tell this tea is brewed to exacting specifications and I've yet to get a "bad" bottle.<br /><br />Delicious straight from the bottle or over ice. Recommended.

review/summary: Great flavor and consistency
review/text: I tried Lemongrass Green after reading a blog entry at Men's Health, where the only knock was the relatively low level of catechins. The flavor is wonderful, however: a little grassy, with citrus coming slightly afterwards. It is very slightly bitter at the finish, but entirely pleasant. I've read that some drinkers will carefully reheat this bottled tea rather than brew their own but haven't tried that - it's too good right from the refrigerator.

review/text: This doesn't taste bitter to me in the slightest.  The green tea has a wonderful grassy/herbal taste and the lemongrass flavor is very distinct.  It in no way tastes like floor cleaner, that review was way off base.  This is the first grocery product I'm ordering through Amazon (and auto delivery) because it's just so hard to find, not to mention expensive, around here.  I'm looking forward to trying it with sushi, but it goes just as well with a simple sandwich.  Definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys unsweetened tea as well as fresh lemongrass.

review/summary: Another excellent Ito En tea, different & fresh flavor
review/text: I am a great fan of all of the Ito En & Teas' Tea products, and I love lemongrass so I was intrigued by this.  The lemongrass flavor was true, but stronger than I'd expected it to be, so I mixed the tea 50/50 with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTI6BI">Westsoy Organic Unsweetened Original Soymilk ( 8x64 OZ)</a> and that made it work for me.  Somehow the added texture/flavor from the soymilk just rounded things out.  What I like about Ito En teas is how fresh and pure they all taste; what sets this tea apart from the rest is the distinctly bright, energizing and refreshing flavor from the lemongrass.  It just seems like a great summer refreshment to me.  I gave it 4 stars only because I didn't fully enjoy it plain.  But, that's a bonus because it saves money; I love these teas but they are a little pricey.

review/text: I would not recommend this Ito En Teas' Tea- Lemongrass Green Tea, especially not if you want to drink it with a meal. I love lemongrass in various soups and with seafood or poultry, but somehow lemongrass in green tea just isn't the same. Lemongrass does not simply taste like a lemon, so this tea tastes nothing like green tea with lemon. While this tea may be very healthy for you, I personally could not get past the lemon Pledge/lemon dish soup flavor (not that I have ever consumed either of those products, but you will understand if you try this tea). Without sugar or any other flavoring, the lemongrass flavor is so incredibly strong that is of course all you taste. I took one sip from this tea and dumped it down the sink. I hate to waste something I paid for, even if it is just a beverage, but I found this green tea completely undrinkable.

review/summary: So that's why it costs so much!
review/text: I was really hesitant to buy this food because it costs about twice the most expensive premium brand grocery dog food costs at the pet food store, but decided to give it a shot since Amazon offers a deal for subscribing. (I bought the 15 lb bag, which is why I don't have a verified purchase in the 30 lb listing) I honestly wouldn't even know about this product if our new puppy's breeder hadn't recommended it, and was using it on their pups. I'm not one of those people that have to eat organic, or those guys that have to have the word "holistic" on their animals' food. In fact, I usually just buy what's on sale, as long as it meets my personal quality standards. But after trying this, it kind of makes sense why they cost more.<br /><br />When I first opened the bag, I noticed that it did not have that strong dog food scent that most dog foods I've purchased for my dogs have. It actually smells kind of good, to where I would almost be brave enough to taste it. Second, the kibble size is perfect for my golden retriever puppy. Not too big or small, and it perfect for training treats. In the morning before feeding my dogs in their bowl, I usually let them earn their meal through training, and these are perfectly sized and tasty enough to use for that. The outer layer seems almost coated, so you don't get kibble crumbs in your hand and into your fingertips. Third, and most importantly- It's really good for your dog! Prior to buying our new puppy, I did a lot of research (as a good prospective dog owner should) on raising a healthy dog. One of the biggest things that stuck with me was that you WILL pay for your dogs' health- either in the form of good dog food, or in the form of a vet bill. Have a nice day:)

review/text: We are relatively new pet owners.  We've had our goldendoodle for 10 months and during that time, we've tried a variety of products.  Started out with Wellness, moved on to Chicken Soup, I think there was another one in the mix, and then landed on this one.  I don't have anything negative to say about the others- our dog likes them all- but this one made a huge difference in her bathroom schedule.  She is so regular right now, I could set a clock to her.  I attribute it to the food.  We are very happy with this product.

review/summary: gassy puppy!
review/text: Our puppy was being fed this food for a little over a month with no problem. She eagerly awaited to be fed, and wagged her tail the whole time she was eating. However, in the past couple of days she has been very gassy. It seems to be related to this food, because when we switched back to a raw diet, there were no problems. It seems like all of a sudden her body changed, and is not accepting of this food. She was farting every 5-10 minutes... very SMELLY gas that would clear the room! Her stools were also soft and very smelly.<br /><br />I'm going to switch to the grain-free "Instinct" line of food by the same company, and see if this helps. I'd like to go 100% raw, but it just is a bit too much work.

review/summary: Depends upon your use of them
review/text: After watching a Dr. Oz special which lauded the digestive effects of Caraway Seeds, I ran to my computer to order some immediately.  The idea that ingesting a half a handful of seeds would cure me of excessive gas and bloat had me excited beyond words, until I received them in the mail and shoved them in my mouth ...<br /><br />Word to the wise, do NOT eat caraway seeds by the handful - you may choke to death, but even worse, you may not.  Picture a day at the farm, walking through the stables ... now picture picking up some straw and shoving it into your mouth ... that would be preferable to chewing craway seeds.<br /><br />The best parallel to eating caraway seeds would be if you went to woodshop, picked up the carvings, mixed it with dirt and pepper and chewed.<br /><br />Now that doesn't mean that you shouldn't buy them, but be aware they need to be an ingredient ... like if you want to bake your own rye, although, that seems foolhardy since Rye bread is cheap.

review/summary: Very Happy Dog
review/text: And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating.

It's supposed to be good for you, but most people eat it just because they like how it tastes.<br /><br />Marmite isn't easy to find in the U.S, but you can get it in larger "health food" type chains like Sun Harvest Farms and Whole Foods Market where they charge about $5.00 for a 125g jar.

review/summary: A Yankee's take on a British staple
review/text: Having lived in the US all of my life (although I have traveled quite a bit) I had never heard of Marmite until last week. I've been participating in an on-line, UK based think-tank dealing with international brands and digital advertising. As we discussed products that we grew up with and are still loyal to Marmite came up several times. I looked at some Marmite ads (the British call them "adverts"), and then searched for it on Amazon. Being a dedicated foodie I decided to give it a shot. Here is my impression:<br /><br />When I first opened the glass jar and gave it a whiff it seemed oddly familiar. I put just a dab on my spoon and tasted it straight. Again, strangely familiar. The taste was very strong, almost condensed. I could taste the beer-like yeast but I was also getting a savory, deep vegetable flavor. Then it hit me.<br /><br />I love to make sauces and I often use pre-made glaces and demi-glaces which have a very thick consistency when gently heated (before heating they are almost solid). They come in many different varieties: beef; duck; veal; chicken; lamb; seafood; mushroom; vegetable; etc. Marmite has a strong resemblance to a straight, undiluted, vegetable glace. Pungent, earthy and with that quality that the Japanese refer to as "Umami". WOW! Who knew? Well, I guess a lot of people did but it was new to me. Now, what to do with it...<br /><br />My on-line British friends gave me some sage advice: use it sparingly and on some sort of bread with butter. I bought some fresh English Muffin bread from a local artisan bakery shop, lightly toasted it, coated it thinly with about 2/3 teaspoon of Marmite and spread some salted Vermont cultured butter onto it. HEAVEN! The Marmite balanced out the heaviness of the butter perfectly. That gave me the inspiration for my next test. I've alway loved a toasted bagel with cream cheese or Marscapone but need something to cut the palate-coating fat of the cheese besides a slice of onion (lox works well if you have it). Marmite fit the bill technically, but I think that I will have to get used to the combination. Still, I will keep using it here for a while and I think that it might become a favorite for me.<br /><br />Next I tried it in a simple sauce. I browned a tablespoon of finely chopped shallots in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (who am I kidding? I used 2 tablespoons of butter). After the shallots were browned I added 3 tablespoons of Marite and 1 teaspoon of water. I reduced it a little and added 1/3 cup of heavy cream, a small bouquet garnet in cheesecloth and 1 tablespoon of dry sherry. I reduced it by about half and adjusted the strength by adding more Marmite (I needed more, maybe I should have used less cream). When finished it tasted really good, not great but it could certainly WOW most people. Put this on fish, chicken, turkey, or any light meat or veggie and it works.<br /><br />Marmite has an advertising campaign that tells people that they will either love it or hate it. I am definitely in the love camp.

review/text: I'm not certain a taste for Marmite can be acquired.  You may have to grow up with it.  Not only is it good (spread thinly) on bread and toast, but it is a wonderful savory flavoring for soups and stews.  It can also be dissolved in hot water for an enjoyable drink.  Once appreciated, it is difficult to live without, and, fortunately, I can find the small jars quite easily and only wish people would stock the larger ones.

review/text: I was actually trying to find Vegemite, just out of curiosity. Apparently it's not available in the US, and during my searches I found that Marmite, the British equivalent of the Aussie Vegemite, was available. By equivalent, I mean they are both made from yeast extract. I don't know if they taste the same. Now I ordered and received two 125 gram jars. I'm nearly finished the 2nd jar. The simplest way to eat it is to spread a THIN layer on buttered toast. If you like salty snacks, you might like it. If you don't like salt, run, don't walk from this product. I happen to love salt. Pretzels, potato chips, crackers, etc. without salt have no flavor to me. Personally, I think 2 slices of buttered toast with Marmite is a great way to start the day! I WILL be ordering more soon.

review/text: I have never been outside the U.S. and I don't think I have a bit of British or Australian blood in me, but I love both Marmite and Vegemite, and get both of them at World Market (formerly known as Cost Plus World Market) for about $5.00 a jar. Marmite is more syrupy and salty than Vegemite / Vegemite is more solid and less salty (but still quite salty) than Marmite. VEGANS TAKE NOTE : both are good sources of vegan B vitamins, but Vegemite lacks the crucial B12 and Marmite HAS B12.

Despite hearing that "it's an acquired taste" and "you need to grow up on it," I loved Marmite immediately--in my 30s, and I'm not British! I'm not sure why it gets the bad reputation. Yes, it is salty, intense and concentrated. So you're supposed to use it sparingly! It adds richness and a flavor punch to toast and sandwiches. It's really good on buttered toast with mashed avocado--perfect balance of fat and salt. There's a bit of a tang to it. It's also great in a grilled cheese. Hell, I lick the spoon after I use it... Addictive. Only con: watch the sodium intake. It's the only thing keeping me from eating loads of it.

review/summary: Marmite
review/text: I've seen some people compare this to soya sauce, I would say it's savoury sort of like soya sauce but I can't say it tastes anything like soya sauce. Delicious and nutritious when spread thinly on toast. There's a Marmite cookbook on Amazon that gives you many ideas for cooking with Marmite. It also has some funny and entertaining info and comments from famous people. In short, you either love or hate Marmite, there's no in between. If you liked it as a child you will always love it, I suppose it's harder for people introduced to the taste later in life to take a liking to it.

review/text: Bottles arrived on time and in good condition. Marmite is a love it or hate it affair. If you have lived in the UK or Australia, you would have come across it. I have it on toast with butter, but it's also good as a drink (tastes like strong soup stock) or for use in dishes with mushrooms because it has that dark, earthy flavour.

review/text: I've been eating Fri Chik for over 30 years.  This low fat version is not much different in taste.  I fry it in a flour mixture and spices that I like, soul flavor, garlic, onion.  I use the liquid with added water to make a simple gravy from an envelope mix, a few boiled potatoes, veggie , salad... whatever.  perfect meal.  When I was younger, my family used Fri Chik along with the canned vegetarian burger to form a mock turkey loaf for holidays.  I also love to eat the Fri Chik straight out of the can.

review/text: While I do recall these might not be as delectable as the full-fat version, I'd have to have them side by side to say for sure, and even then I believe the difference probably wouldn't be enough to raise a fuss over. I like these so much I eat them right out of the can. Then there's the added bonus of left over gravy! I like to use the gravy over whole wheat egg noodles, or add to veggie broth when rehydrating tvp. The gravy freezes well until needed, and the FriChick itself stays fresh in the fridge for up to a week once opened. On it's own I personally don't think it actually tastes like chicken, but it quite yummy in it's own right.

While the nuggets are similar in shape to the formed McNuggets, the taste is much more like a juicy beef meatball or meatloaf.<br /><br />Sodium is high here, so it may not be a good choice as a regular meal, with when I have a case of them, it's hard to make them stretch - they're a favorite.<br /><br />They're packed in a rather unappealing liquid, that I make sure to drain and rinse off.

review/text: Heed the advice to find a source for a single can to try before buying the 12-pack. I am not vegetarian, but I do like vegetarian foods from time to time as an alternative. These are better than a lot of real chicken nuggets I have had. They are a bit too salty, for my tastes, to eat as-is with the gravy. No MSG on the label for the FriChik. The label on the can shows 400mg Sodium per serving (about a 1000mg for the can) and 0g dietary fiber, which differs from the nutritional data under the product info. I'd rate them a four, considering, knock off one star for the salitness. I'll finish the case, but will unlikely order again for that reason.

review/text: I love these and the fact that they are low-fat is a definite bonus; the gravy is awesome and I like them so much that I sometimes will get such a craving that I'll eat them just by themselves &lt;g>. My favorite way to have them is in a recipe called "Mock Chicken Casserole".<br /><br />There's not really that big a difference between the low-fat version and the original, higher-fat one, so I'd rather use these and save on the fat. Many times on Thanksgiving and at Christmas, I'll have these in place of the turkey most of my family has and I feel lucky that I get to eat them all by myself (well, I used to get them all to myself until one of my nephews decided to become vegetarian, too; so, now I have to share... lol). They're VERY flavorful and juicy.

These "chiks" come in gravy so they're very moist. I think there's usually five to a can.

review/summary: A very pleasant way to start the day.
review/text: I was introduced to Glengettie tea by some Welsh visitors a number of years ago. It's not gourmet tea but it is a black tea that really helps me start the day. We don't put milk and sugar in the tea, just drink it black. So having a tea like Glengettie just hits the spot.

review/text: I was unhappy to find that Brach's made their candy corn in Mexico, so I set out to find USA-made candy corn. Found this - a California-based company, U.S. made, and pretty good. A bit chewier and less crystalline than Brach's, but pretty tasty.

review/summary: Down with greasy chips!
review/text: I didn't grow up with Pita chips or Pita bread for that matter... I discovered them when I moved to California.  I grew up on greasy, fried potato chips and all the other unhealthy chips who's manufacturer rhymes with "haze".<br /><br />I'm definitely a convert to Stacy's because they pack a lot of taste and they have far less fat and other bad ingredients.  This flavor is particular is my go-to snack at night because they give me a full feeling without worry about breaking my diet.  For some used to potato chips, they may not seem to satisfy you, but I recommend just sticking with them for a few months and you'll grow to enjoy them and you're shrinking wasteline.

review/text: These chips are wonderfull. I've ordered three flavors so far: Texarkana Hot, Parmesan Garlic Herb and Pesto & Sundried Tomato. They are much lighter than fried chips, but are thick and substantial. They are great with dips or on their own. The Texarkana are quite spicy. The other two flavors are on the mild side.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious! And mostly guilt-free
review/text: I'm a big fan of Stacy's pita chips because they're all natural, baked, and delicious. I don't feel too guilty about eating a whole bag because these are not fried, lower in sodium, and caloric total is modest at 200 calories. This flavor is by far my favorite. The chips are coated with a nice golden brown crust of Parmesan cheese and herbs. I don't really taste the garlic and herbs that much, but no complaints. The overall flavor is delicious and addicting.<br /><br />For snackers who are new to Stacy's, they're NOT like potato chips. These are baked pita chips and quite dense/hard by comparison. They'll give your jaw a workout. Many of the pieces are large rectangles that are not bite-sized. I like to crush down the pieces so they are smaller shards and easier to eat.<br /><br />Stacy's pita chips are pricier than regular potato chips. The cheapest I can find them is about $0.50/oz when on sale, so with Subscribe and Save, you are getting a good value.

I really enjoy the flavor and the fact that they are soy free (I seriously don't get why it seems like every American product out there has soy of some form in it especially when you consider all the negatives that go hand in hand with soy), I just wish they weren't so hard! Crunching through them is a chore! But man, they are oh so good :)

She was thrilled that you had it, ordered it, and again was thrilled at how fast it got here and how easy it was to order it. In fact, she is going to order some more.<br /><br />Thank you amazon.com for our little taste of Hawaii everyday!

You generally do not want to substitute all the oil in a recipe with this, as it will impart too much hazelnut flavor.<br /><br />Addendum: Wow the price on these really went up.

review/text: As a German, I cannot live without this oil. Try cooked carrots with a pinch of sugar and this oil. Do not fry or cook with it, just add it plenty AFTER cooking. The aroma is a dream, and it tastes grandious!!<br /><br />Unfortunately amazon is not making any effort in protecting the metal cans. I ordered 3 cans in a set and one book at the same time. Now imagine, they just packed the book in a box and put the oil cans on top. That's all! No packing material, no stuffing, nothing! A box with 3 oil cans in it plus a book.<br /><br />Imagine how that book looked like. It had been roughed up by the metal cans rubbing on it during the 10 days of shipping! And all 3 cans had bendings in the outside. I was glad I still had 2 old cans left from last time, so I could refill the oil into the old cans.<br /><br />If I had a chance to buy this oil somewhere else, I absolutely would, but unfortunately I have not found any other place yet. So I have to deal with amazon's careless packers.<br /><br />But the oil really is fantastic!<br />If you see it somewhere in a store, buy it!!

review/text: I had never tried Hazelnut oil before receiving my order, so I have nothing to compare it to. But I have enjoyed this oil, using it in salad dressings, bread, and baked desserts. It has a very nice Hazelnut aroma and a light flavor. So far I haven't noticed much of a distinct hazelnut flavor in the things I use it in, but it does add something to the overall taste.<br />The oil came in what seemed decent packaging, but each of the cans were dented. Not horribly, just a few dings and a couple of bigger dents. I wonder if perhaps they were damaged before shipping. Oh well.<br /><br />So far my favorite use for this oil is a Raspberry salad dressing. Mix the Hazelnut oil with some Raspberry vinegar and voila! a yummy dressing. Also good in Chocolate Decadence.

review/summary: My GoTo Oil
review/text: Tastes good, smells good, good for you. It has just about the best fat profile of any oil, high in Mono, low in Saturated. I keep it in the fridge and use it in oatmeal, rice, to saute chicken tenders, and I drizzle it on steaks and other meats during or right after cooking. La Tourangelle is a flavorful hazelnut, slightly stronger than some in the grocery store ~ if you can even find hazelnut oil in your grocery.

review/summary: True rich hazelnut flavor
review/text: I have subscribed to getting this oil delivered on a regular basis - that probably says it all. I eat very healthy and only have 2 tablespoons of oil per day - not more. With this restriction I want my oil to be really good and tasty. La Tourangelle Roasted Hazelnut Oil gives dishes that are not garlic olive oil kind of dishes an extra wonderful "hue". Particularly good with okra, brown basmati rice and chicken or tofu.

review/summary: Great price, cans dented
review/text: This is one of the best tasting hazelnut oils I have found.  This is a great price - I did see it at Safeway but the can is half the size for the same price.  Two of the three cans arrived with minor dents in them.

review/summary: Oils OK, arrived damaged, Twice!
review/text: These oils are lighter in flavor than their descritions.  But still a good value. My Biggest problem was the cans were all damaged, not by shipping but by the individual that packaged them.  I ordered 5 of the different flavors, each oil has 3 or 4 cans with the offer.  In the first shippment 9 cans were crushed, not dented.  The 2nd order had 11 cans damaged.  My intent was to give these away as gifts; of course in that condition I was not able to!  If you want these oils for personal use by all means order them.

review/summary: fair to medium in flavor
review/text: Not as good as the walnut oil in flavor. It is best with a raspberry vinegar I think. Still more flavorful than plain olive oil though.
