review/summary: Good Food
review/text: Science Diet has always been known for decent quality food to feed your cat or dog.  This product is no different.  I have a finicky cat who will only eat certain types of dry food and this seems to be one of them.  She took right to the dry without any hesitation and seems to continue to enjoy it.<br /><br />On the downside is the size of the food.  The food comes in large triangular shaped pieces that some cats may not like.  Buy a small bag and try it for your pet.<br /><br />4/5 stars for the size of the food and the price tag.

review/summary: Saved my Cat
review/text: This product was recommended by my vet, and literally saved my cat's life. I was very worried and was willing to try any diet on the market. Really, I have tried many diets etc but nothing seemed to help out my cat after the sudden onset of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  I have no idea of where that came from. I always gave him clean water; fresh food etc but this caught me off guard. I have been feeding him "Friskies" prior to Hill's and everything was fine until one weekend. After a couple of days of feeding him, I noticed an immediate difference. My cat was no longer passing soft stools (diarrhea), and was eating as he normally did. The diet also seems to have been helping him regulate his weight also. He was a very big guy (~20 lbs) but now he is down to 16, after about 4 months on Hill's. Thumbs up and 5 stars for this product!

review/text: Wow if i knew how much cats would love this stuff i would have been feeding it to any and all of my cats long ago.  You would think it was wet food the way my kitty chows it down.  I got it because he had gingivitus and i had to spend quite a bit to have his teeth worked on.  The vet told me his teeth are still looking nice and clean a few months later!

review/text: Ok cats, you can stop wiggling and showing me your lovely bellies, and get up and play.<br /><br />Let's get down to the nitty gritty. Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food does what it says it does and MORE!!!<br /><br />Now, I DO feed my cats wet food, so I give them Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food as a TREAT and a SUPPLEMENT -- and it is powerful stuff!! To be graphic, let's just say that Big Bad Baby Twinkle's poops used to look like small rocks, no matter what I did for her food (and she loves her daily hairball gel too) -- but NOW after feeding her even a small amount of Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food (twice a day after she eats her wet food) one look at her litterbox and I think that a German Shepherd has visited the litterbox. To say that this makes me happy may sound wierd but now I KNOW that "stuff" is moving THROUGH her intestines and not getting impacted or staying inside and creating toxins.<br /><br />The same for Cee Cee kitty -- she, who is daaainty and small (BBBT weighs twice as much as Cee Cee and is twice as long as Cee Cee), also pops out some big ones now. I am happy -- yes I am -- this means their intestinal transit time (from eating to pooping) is shorter and they are healthier for it.

review/summary: Hills Science Diet Oral Care
review/text: My cat loves this cat food! He likes the big chunks and if I mix it with another variety which is smaller nuggets he sifts through and pulls out the bigger oral care pieces. Another plus - my cat is 13 and has never had his teeth cleaned. The Vet believes the oral care chunks have been beneficial in keeping down the tartar on his teeth.

review/text: My 2 indoor cats have been on this food forever.  They do not get any canned food supplements.  However, with all the Science Diet flavors I often find that the large bag of this one is not in stock when I go to buy it in my local pet stores including the big box stores like Petco or Petsmart.  so finding it on Amazon and eligible for Prime shipping made my day.

review/text: This is the only flavor of Science Diet (or any other brand) they will all eat without complaint. I don't know what I'll do if they stop making it. I have 3 cats, two Maine Coons who get hairballs, and this stuff really works to prevent that. As long as they eat some of it daily no more hairballs on the floor. It's a great product. I hope they never try to "improve" the recipe or change it in any way, or my cats will probably reject it as they have so many others! If it ain't broke please don't fix it, Science Diet! It's a winner as is.

review/text: We have several cats, one of which has had a vomiting problem for many years.  We tried many cats food.  Science diet sensitive is one of the foods that works.  There are 2 otherss.  1 is Purina 1 Sensitive which is also great.  the other is a Royal Canin Oral Sensitive.  I think the Science Diet and the Purina 1 are the best.  We also give the cat Prednisolone under a Vet prescription, as the vet said it was inflamatory bowel disease.

review/summary: Does what it claims
review/text: I had to stop giving my  15 year old cat dry food because he could no longer hold it down (even the ones with only whole food ingredients were too hard on his system).  He would even throw up blood clots if I had to leave him with dry food for a couple of days.  His stool became loose and smelled even worse than usual.  I gave him this on a trip that I had to bring him along with me and he has been doing great on it. His stool is hard now and he holds it down.

I decided to add Hill's Adult Oral Care to his regular food for two months and see if it made a difference.  Two months later, my vet examined him and he no longer needs the cleaning!  Now every tail in my home has this product added to their favorite food.

review/summary: Bought this for the Fiber
review/text: Was feeding my 3 cats - Blue Buffalo Blue Wilderness Chicken Dry Cat Food - which is one of the best brands out there... No grain, all meat, blah blah.  Cats loved it over all the other 'meat only' brands...<br /><br />Only problem was... soft stools...  Talked to the vet and she said that sometimes cats need some form of fiber, even if it isn't nutritious, it helps to bulk up the stools and get rid of the God awful odor...<br /><br />So went up and down the food aisle and this particular brand/version had the highest fiber content of all of the bags of food.  The BWC food has 3.5% fiber... This indoor cat food has 10% fiber... yes it is indigestible corn... that's the whole idea... a form of roughage to helps the bowels.  This food also has added fiber on top of the corn stuff etc...<br /><br />So I'm going to see if this helps with the soft very stinky stools... if it does, I'm sticking with it.<br /><br />So far the cats haven't seemed to mind the larger kibble size.  They chomp a piece in half, and eat both halves...

review/summary: Blotto cries for it!
review/text: My cat has gingivitis, and he's only 2. My vet prescribed fancy expensive food that you can only get from a vet. I did some research, and this stuff is made by the same company, with a nearly identical ingredients list. While i was mixing in his old food with this stuff to acclimate him, he'd pick out the new food until he ate it all, leaving behind his purina!<br />As far as helping his gingivitis, it's helped a little. The plaque has gone down considerably, but the gumline is still reddish. He really loves this stuff, so I'll probably buy this again.

review/summary: My kitty LOVES it.
review/text: The story goes that I adopted a cat from an agency last summer. Having always grown up with dogs and not cats, I went ahead and wandered down to my Target to get a bag of Friskies. About a week later, my kitty (named Sugar) starting vomiting. Confused, I assumed it was the wet food we were feeding her in the morning. So we changed it. Then we changed it again. No results. I took her to the vet and asked. He checked her out and said likely the problem was having a sensitive stomach and he recommended Science Diet. Bam. My cat does great now. She's lost a little bit of weight so she's the right size now. She doesn't vomit anymore. This food works and it works well. I read the negative review here and I would say the problem was unique to the cat. My cat loves it and is doing brilliantly now.

review/summary: The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?
review/text: I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Worst Junk Food Ever
review/text: I have two cats and have always been feeding them this food,one is 5 and the other 9 years old and they are both 15 pounds.So they are fat and I could never figure out why,since they only got to share on cup between each other all day.So about two weeks ago I did some research on this food and my eyes were opened.I feel horrible that I fed them this junk food and I thought I was giving them the Best out there,since my Vet gave it to me and said it was great for them.<br />So anyways my male cat is now on Wellness Indoor dry and expensive wet food like Blue Buffalo,Wellness and Merrick.He loves it and I had no problem switching him over and I already notice the difference in his energy level.But my biggest issue is my female cat,she will not touch any other food than her Science junk food.I tried mixing it with the new food,starting at 75% old to 25% new,nothing she wouldn't touch it.So I tried 90% to 10%,still nothing.She cried and wined and didn't eat one morsel in four days and was just laying in one spot all day having even less energy than before.So I called my new Vet and she said now it is getting dangerous because she wouldn't eat at all.I had to give her her old junk food back,because I did not want her to die.I have no idea what to do,she is so addicted to this food and I can't get her of it.She hates wet food with a passion.I am worried about Diabetes if she will get any bigger.So I am really sad that nothing seems to work with her.<br />I made her a junk food addict,it's my fault.I wish I never started her on this food at all.

review/summary: Terrible ingredients but my cat did eat it.
review/text: Check the first 4 ingredients: Brewers Rice, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn Gluten Meal, Powdered Cellulose. Rice is ok but not as a first ingredient in a cat food; meat by-product is sketchy in general in a food this expensive; corn meal I have no great opinion of, but whatever; but the 4th ingredient - powdered cellulose - is sawdust. SAWDUST is not what I want to feed my cat, even to help her lose weight.<br /><br />No wonder this food feels so "light" physically.  The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.<br /><br />I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer.

They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  Please try another brand like orijen or evo.  your cat will thank you.

review/summary: Toasted Corn and Rice for Cats!
review/text: I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!

First, its labeled for cats up to 6 years old, second it appears to be jammed will fillers, and third, its rather pricey.  I'm glad I came home and started researching this product and reading about others experiences with this food, and I'm definitely not feeding this stuff to my cat!

That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting.

review/summary: Not tastey
review/text: I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.

review/summary: BAD, do NOT buy!
review/text: Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling "corn gluten meal" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google "U.S. Patent 5,030,268" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price.

review/summary: OK, but could be a lot better
review/text: I have tried the Jack Links Jerkey chew a few times, mainly as a way to have a little flavor in my mouth while working in hot/dusty conditions. This seems to be the only brand you can find stocked on convenience store shelves.<br /><br />In terms of the flavor, the "Original" is pretty mild. As noted by a previous reviewer, I also found the can didn't seem to have much in it. However, it only takes a small pinch at a time. For me, I thought it was a little too much on the dry/powdery side. Realistically, it's probably the "ground up" pieces that probably fall to the side when they are packaging their regular jerkey. It does highly resemble the "genuine" bacon bits that you buy at the grocery.<br /><br />For what it was, it was OK. I would like to see it a little more "shredded", so it packs better, and a little less ground up (like coffee grounds). I'd also like to see it a bit more moist, so it would pack better. As it stands, you have to be careful opening the can in a strong wind, or you might lose half of it. Finally, I think it would be interesting if they had a mildly nicotine-infused version, but that would restrict over-the-counter sales and bring on a whole new level of rules. Otherwise, I don't see where it would really help someone get over a dipping habit.<br /><br />One reviewer noted that this could easily be considered a "gateway" path for children to using real tobacco. To that, I would agree on some levels. Much like "Big League Chew" resembles a pouch of chewing tobacco, or "cancy cigarettes" resembles a real smoke. The important thing, if you are allowing your child to "eat" this, is that you convey the dangers of tobacco use and make clear that this is not the same thing. The packaging does not "make" the product something else.

Also, naturally, there is no nicotine so you won't get any of the stuff you are hooked on in the first place.  I don't know what else you'd use it for except as maybe a substitute for "bacon bits" on your salad or something as due to it's dryness it's tough to get out of the can.

review/summary: Not Sure the Point-Bad Packaging
review/text: CAREFUL!!  My nine year old stepson is around people that dip REAL tobacco in similar packaging.  Therefore, he idolizes this as a way to mock the older guys and their bad habit.  When he came for a visit he wanted some so we bought it.  Next thing we know, he was asking for a snack.  When we inquired about the jerky, he said it was not to eat but to "put in your mouth and suck the juice".  He even packed it like grown men do their tobacco chew.  Granted, a child will absorb what he sees around him but I feel the packaging makes it look too much like a child's version of adult chew; reminds me of the candy cigarettes. So, this product in my opinion is either for a child as a stepping stone to chewing tobacco or an adult's step down from it...otherwise, what's the point?

You can barely call this cherry cheesecake.

If you let it cook to a light golden brown it is best.<br />I make 21 instead of 24 cupcakes and they puff up into little domed cupcakes. I use soybean oil. They are so cute.<br />I think the sweetness is perfect and with the vanilla frosting these taste like gourmet. Thank you, Nora! With 3 eggs<br />these kind of have that waffle cone taste. This mix is my favorite.

review/summary: Wonderful!!! No Cornstarch
review/text: My kids and I are allergic to GMO corn- I've no idea why, but it makes us sick.  This is one of the few mixes that has no corn starch in it.  Not only that, but it's delicious too!  I get so tired of having to bake everything from scratch- so it's great to keep naturally Nora cakes in the pantry for times when I am in a hurry.

review/summary: Tastes & Looks Like Homemade!
review/text: Naturally Nora cake mix tastes like homemade and looks homemade too.  Tasting homemade is a good thing, but looking homemade isn't if you are baking to impress or for a special occasion.<br /><br />The yellow cake mix tastes like grandma used to make, but does not rise well.  The cake I made was lopsided and didn't rise well.  (I used one springform pan).  The cake was soft, moist and tasted great, if not a bit heavy, but honestly, I can make that kind of cake from scratch.  There's really nothing to it.  And since you have to add 3 eggs, some oil and milk to the mix, you are only a few ingredients short of making a cake from scratch anyway.<br /><br />You have to add a stick of melted butter to the frosting mix, which makes it a butter cream frosting.  This kind of frosting stiffens when it cools and won't be too fancy looking either.  It tastes fine; nothing special about the frosting consistently or taste.<br /><br />Overall, for the price, these mixes aren't worth it to me.  With all the ingredients you are adding to the mix, you'd might as well pull out your cookbook and make one from scratch!

review/summary: Kale Chip Fanatic Says "Yes" to Rhythm BBQ Flavor==Scrumptious!
review/text: Mind you, I am a kale chip fanatic! Started eating these things like there was no tomorrow when they first came out over 10 years ago (No, I am not a raw vegan, but eat plenty of raw foods). The wonderful thing about kale chips, in my humble opinion, is that they are a great portable "green" snack. Beware though, as they are somewhat high in fat due to the nut-based batter that coats them, but if your diet is low in fat (as mine is), then these are the perfect food. They are crunchy and filling.<br /><br />One other plus about Rhythm Foods packaging is that the package is resealable.<br /><br />Note that this flavor does contain a small amount of sugar. The ingredients are: kale, carrot, apple cider vinegar, tomato, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, beets, yeast powder, garlic, raw sugar, spices, sea salt, natural liquid smoke concentrate. (almost all ingredients are organic).<br /><br />All kale chips are pretty expensive and this one is no exception. A 2 oz bag is going to cost about $5! which believe it or not is pretty much the going price for this product. Anyway, this might be a good crossover product for those not familiar with raw foods, so give it a try--I mean how many awesome green leafy vegetable snacks are there out there? Kale chips definitely fall into that category--awesomely scrumptious!

review/text: I make kale chips at home on a regular basis but wanted to give these a try for flavor inspiration. I opened the bag and a nice scent of BBQ wafted out. So, I pop a piece into my mouth...and while it tasted indeed like BBQ, there was also a distinct stale flavor and the powder flavoring actually coated my tongue - I could have been eating a BBQ-flavored cardboard chip for the lack of kale flavor. They have a heavy feel and do not resemble kale much at all - I was really disappointed. Back to making them myself.

review/summary: Find out what your baby likes. The subscription price is fair
review/text: The Vegetable Variety Pack provides an opportunity to find out what your baby likes.<br /><br />We have twin 7-month olds and their favorite is the sweet potato followed by the carrot jars.  They love those.  They like the winter squash.  We could not get either of them to eat the peas with brown rice despite numerous attempts.<br /><br />They like the brown rice cereal we give them though, which we get from the same brand, Earth's Best. They really dislike the peas and will not eat that one.<br /><br />You can get this variety pack at the subscription price, which when considering free shipping is fair enough.<br /><br />You can also get any of these flavor types individually in packs of 12 for the same price and with the same subscription arrangement.  You can even get lentils with brown rice under the same terms, so scroll and see all the types of jars they have.  Therefore, once you know what your baby likes and will eat, you'll know which subscriptions, if any, to sign up for.<br /><br />For us it makes sense to go with subscriptions since we're buying for 2 babies.

If it's in the lids, it's going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging, shipping, storage, etc. I was planning on being a devoted Earth's Best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass, but then I found out about the BPA. As a note, if BPA doesn't bother you, most of Earth's Best food is tasty.

review/text: I started to panic when I read the comment from someone about BPA in the lid of EB glass baby jar foods. I make most of my baby food at home, but when on the road this is such an easy option. I called the company right away to get the facts. I was so relieved to hear that there are no BPA's that come into contact with the baby food. There are two layers of plastic in the lid and the layer that touches the baby food does NOT contain BPA. The layer in between has small traces of it, but their research has shown that it does not leech into the food. I personally feel comfortable with this and am glad I can still support this company.

review/summary: BPA IN LIDS!!
review/text: I bought this line of baby food because it was organic and came in glass jars. I prefer to make my own baby food, but some times you need other options, especially when traveling. It is incredibly disappointing to find out that there is BPA in the lids. I just talked to the company and they confirmed this. My understanding of the canning process is that it requires heating the product to a high temperature in order to create an airtight seal. So not only is the food being exposed to the BPA during this heating process, but then during the entire storage process until an unknowing consumer like me buys it. I feel incredibly dumb for trusting Earth's best to be good for my baby. Get with the program and create BPA free lids! I recommend everyone taking the time to call the company and urge them to change their packaging. Until then I will stop buying this food line.<br /><br />Here is a website that will give you some ideas for other organic baby foods that have BPA free packaging<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Nice selection of basic baby food vegetables
review/text: I am pleased with the Earth's Best Vegetable variety pack.  These are the standard basic baby food vegetables: Winter Squash, Carrots, Sweet Potatoes, and Peas with Brown Rice.  I would have preferred plain peas but I am guessing they add the brown rice to thicken it and make it not so runny.  The flavors are bland but palatable and slightly sweet so most babies (mine included) enjoy these vegetables.  The consistency is great for babies from 5-9 months but probably too runny for older babies 10+ months.  Three of these four (squash, carrots, sweet potatoes) are available at my local store but the price is slightly cheaper on Amazon and the variety pack is convenient.  The cardboard tray is great for storing the jars in my pantry so they aren't rolling around everywhere.  I will purchase this product again as long as my child is eating baby food.

review/text: I am a strong believer in giving my baby organic foods as much as possible. We used many of the Earth's Best flavors and baby really enjoyed most of them. What I found irritating though was how runny many of the flavors were; I often had to add oatmeal or rice just to keep the food on the spoon. Water is added to many if not most of the flavors. I wondered if that was a necessity however "Plum" "Ella's Kitchen" and "Happy Baby" brands (also organic) do not have water as an added ingredient. We definitely used these, but to be honest, I prefered the other brands because I felt we were getting a better value considering we weren't paying for water in those packages.

review/text: We like this variety pack, and our baby eats all four varieties and seems to like them all.  However, it's unfortunate that the only green vegetable in this variety pack is green peas.  Earth's Best also makes a spinach/potato variety and a green bean variety, and it would be nice if one of those could be included rather than three orange vegetables and only one green vegetable.<br /><br />These vegetables are very well pureed, and are perhaps even a bit too thin for older babies (our baby is 8 months old).  We like to mix in some rice cereal or oatmeal to thicken the consistency, and this seems to work well.

So my go-to backup is Earth's Best Baby Food.  We're on stage two now, almost stage 3, and he loves them.  I appreciate the no added sugars / preservatives and that it's mostly organic.  He loves the taste and combos.  Good stuff, great product, LOVE IT!

review/summary: I love earth's best
review/text: I have made my own baby food in the past but with the fourth one it was too overwhelming for me without much help. Earth's best has a great texture and the fact that it is organic make feel better about not making my own. I also like the variety of the flavors in the variety pack.

review/summary: love it but would love it more with less orange.
review/text: I love earths best and was excited to see this variety pack on amazon. We were doing the subscribe option but had to stop as this pack contains to much orange!I know it sounds strange but i like my dd to get a bot of variety and with only one green option the oranges (winter squash and sweet potato) were staking up and not being used....I would say good to order every once in a while but not enough variety to subscribe to.

review/summary: Great food - baby and toddler love it - note for Amazon
review/text: These jars of vegetables from Earth's Best seem to be the only way to get veggies into our toddler. We've thought about making our own baby food, but anyway you do the math, it just takes way too long.  Earth's Best is a good brand and I trust them when they say no sugar or salt is added.  A note to Amazon - apparently you changed the packaging on this, which is great. But I think it basically meant that you said this product with the old standard "retail packaging" was out of stock, so we thought the whole product was out of stock on subscribe and save and didn't know what to do. We actually had to buy jars at a higher price at our local grocery store. It turns out you do have it with the new "frustration free packaging" and I had to unsubscribe from the old item and subscribe to this. Might have been nice to have a note next to it where it says out of stock, something along the lines of "We have it in stock in different packaging." Or perhaps send us an email with "Earths best baby food in the subject line."  I'm sure there's software to do all that easily.  Generally, you guys make our life much easier, so when you don't, it's unusual, and I thought I should let you know.

review/summary: Packaging for delivery needs to be better
review/text: I received my first order of Earth's Best Vegetable Variety 12- pack and one of the jars were completely shattered spilling pureed peas and brown rice onto half of the other jars. I had to VERY carefully clean, wash and inspect all the other jars to make sure they weren't also broken or have any glass pieces stuck to  it. And when I am ready to use a jar to feed him, I inspect it again before feeding. Now that I think about it, I should just throw it all away to avoid any risks. I normally make my baby food at home but thought these would be convenient for on the go feedings. My 7 month old son seems to like everything and has not rejected any foods I've given him, yet. *knock on wood* Anyway, I'm sure this stuff is good. But if I decide to buy it again, it'll be in the stores.

review/summary: Absolutely Disgusting
review/text: First off, I realize slim jim groups all their reviews together. I dont have a problem with their other products just specifically this slim jim flavor, Zesty Garlic.<br /><br />To begin, I absolutely love garlic and put it on literally everything I eat. I also love slim jims. So I figured why not order a box of these! Fast forward a week when the box arrives I eagerly open one of these bad boys to see how it tastes. My initial and only reaction was absolute disgust. For lack of a better words, these slim jims taste like feet. More specifically, feet with a slight tinge of garlic. I wasn't able to take another bite, not to mention the small piece I had left my breath smelling like dead fish.<br /><br />I'm hard pressed to believe that anyone at slim jim HQ had actually tasted these before putting them on store shelves and online. Now I have 17 sticks left, and I honestly wouldn't even dream about giving these to my worse enemy.<br /><br />All in all, I've done many stupid things in my life. But, spending 40 bucks on a box of feet jerky definitely ranks as top 3.

review/text: My son bought this at a 5 & 10 store for he and I to try now we are totally addicted they have a burst of zesty garlic flavor without the burn of original slim jims we definitely do not taste anything nasty nor is the consistency like wet dog food as both reviews here have stated, Not sure if they got a box of old, or tainted sticks but the ones we buy are delicious and the only ones I now buy besides the mild..I say give it a try, I gave my mom one today and she is now hooked as well :o) Delicious!!!!

review/text: This 'stuff' was terrible, the flavor is okay but the but the texture of the meat inside seems as if they filled the skin with wet dog food. Slim Jim has some great products, this is not one of them. Avoid these sticks at all cost.
