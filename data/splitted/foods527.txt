review/summary: Best decaf tea available
review/text: I love Twinings Lady Grey tea.  It is the perfect blend of bergamot/citrus that is light and not overwhelming. I had to give up caffeine for medical reasons, but still wanted to have my daily lady grey. I tried various other flavors of decaf brands available locally. I gave up tea entirely this past summer because I didn't enjoy the taste of any I found. I was so excited when I found this decaf version here on Amazon with convenient subscribe and save.

review/summary: Wonderful tea!
review/text: This is a great decaffinated tea. It's very hard to find in the stores so I was happy to find it online. This seller sent it in a box, neatly packed. It took a bit longer than I would have wanted, but I think that was because of the holidays. Snow and all - overall, quite happy with quality and delivery of product.

review/summary: Love my Morning Joe....
review/text: Well, I don't know anything about the Gold Coast coffee issue but I know I've liked Morning Joe as soon as I found out about it and tried it.  Even though my favorites were Verona and Italian Roast, Morning Joe quickly became my favorite.  Unfortunately, it has been discontinued in all the grocery stores in my area.  With the price increases in coffee, I think this 6-pack is a decent value.  Hopefully the coffee itself is not being discontinued.  (I still drink Verona as well.)  :-)

review/summary: Morning Joe is the same as the old Gold Coast
review/text: I was skeptical at first when Starbucks started calling Gold Coast morning joe (lower case on purpose) but after drinking a couple pounds now I am completely convinced it is the same and just as great as the old Gold Coast.  I'm been drinking Gold Coast for several years now and it is the only ground coffee I stock at home.  Up to now I've always purchased it at the store but am switching to Amazon since it is about 30% less expensive and I just signed up for Amazon Prime.  My only concern is that most vendors who sell Gold Coast on Amazon don't seem to honor Amazon Prime.

review/summary: Cat Approved
review/text: The only reason that I bought this PetGrass is because I was ordering something else and needed to spend a few more dollars for free shipping.  Lucky for my cats, I chose this PetGrass for them :-)<br /><br />I have 2 cats - 1 of them isn't too crazy about the grass, but 1 of them LOVES it!  He will chew on the grass, lick it, and play with it too.  In addition to putting the grass near their food bowls (still in the pouch), I also snip bits of it into their food.<br /><br />I am not sure about the actual health benefits of this on my cats, but they seem to like it.  Even though 1 of my cats doesn't bother with it when it is in the pouch, she seems to like it in her food.<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />Just one pouch produces a lot of grass.  It does last quite a while as long as you keep watering it appropriately (my last batch is going on 3 weeks).  But, it is too much for my cats.  So, I split the amount in half.  When I open the pouch, I will divide the seeds and dirt.  I'll only put half in at a time.  Once the first batch goes dead, I'll add the second batch - I put it in the same pouch after rinsing it out.

review/summary: Tall, sturdy and lots of it
review/text: Had problems with a different brand because it either wouldn't grow or it would grow bugs.  This stuff grows nice, is very sturdy and long lasting.  Kitty loves her new dental floss (and occasional snack).  It's very tall and thick compared to most grass I've purchased in the past.  Growing it all at once may be more than your cat needs or wants.  I split mine up into quarters.  Great value.

review/text: I really enjoyed growing the wheat grass using this package. It was simple, clean, and the grass grew really well!  I was pleasantly surprised at how lush and green the grass was. Though my dog doesn't eat it off the stems, I just cut them into smaller pieces over his food. Definitely recommended for the experience, whether your pet will eat it is a different stories, as we all know, the little ones can be picky. =)

review/summary: Big win with our Pride.
review/text: I have five totally indoor cats, which means that they have zero access to fresh greens.  One of them, aptly named Monster, will eat anything that looks remotely like a plant; green fabric, faux flowers, my floral purse.  Thus far we have tried approximately 5 other brands of cat grass and this one is the biggest hit.<br /><br />The cats all love this stuff, and we are also snipping bits off for our chinchilla and box turtle.<br />The packaging is nice and sturdy so the cats cant destroy it while munching.<br />Greens are thicker and healthier looking than most of the other brands we've tried.<br />Directions are easy to follow.<br />I like that its USDA certified and provides batch information for each bag, including contents, date tested, and type of wheat.<br />Unlike many other brands of pet greens that only target cats, this is marketed towards a variety of animals and includes suggested methods for feeding each.  I am the inventory mgr at a petstore and this allows us to reach more customers with the product!<br />The company, Bellrock Growers, supports animal rescue, adoption and shelter programs, which is an added bonus to an avid animal lover!<br />The only downside is that I have to hide the container while the grass is regrowing!  The cats will go to great lengths to find and munch on it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this brand of pet grass!

review/summary: A healthy and natural hairball remedy that's hugely popular at our house
review/text: The senior cat in our fairly finicky 3-cat household has a foot injury that's taking a very long time to heal, so I've had to close off feline access to the patio where my cats like to graze. Hairball upchucks ensued in short order.  The Cosmic grass seed from the pet store was a big hit, but it's been out of stock for weeks now. Which is how we came to try this. Was a tad worried about how quickly my guys would do away with the contents of such a wee small garden-in-a-bag. But the crop it produced  is much more dense than other kitty grasses we've tried and is still going strong after a couple of weeks on the floor next to their water dish--despite heavy use. It often gets tipped over, but since nothing ever spills out, that's not a problem. My cats, for some reason, won't eat snipped grass scattered over their food. They will only chomp greenery straight from the source. This product is perfect for that.<br /><br />Update 11/30/11: First batch lasted a full five weeks.  Have ordered more.

review/text: Grew like a charm in the window; per reviews from others I only put about half the grass seed in there and it was still really thick / lush. Of the four cats, only one of them chowed down on it pretty regularly.<br /><br />While the packaging was pretty conveinent, the cats didn't like it very much: even cutting the edges back, the sharp edges of the package seemed to bother them.<br /><br />While this was a neat product and did everything it said it would, in the future I'm just going to get a pot and a package of grass seeds.

review/summary: Excellent product, but be careful!
review/text: I bought this grass for my very picky (tortoiseshell) cat and she loved it.  Every time she walked through the room she would either rub her face on the plant or take a few bites.  If I so much as dared to touch it while she was nearby she would swat my hand away!  And she's an indoor/outdoor cat, so it isn't like this is her only option for fiber either.<br /><br />I say "be careful" because after about two weeks I noticed she stopped eating it, then by the third week it was all wilted and brown.  I'm no greenthumb by any means, but it seems I should have used a free draining pot (like the instructions say to do...I'm just an idiot) instead of the opaque, closed-bottom one I chose.  It turns out I had the grass swimming, and when I dumped out the pot it was probably the foulest smelling mush on earth.  I had to open all my windows and run the attic fan to clear out the stench!<br /><br />That's not the product's fault at all, hence five stars.  In fact, I'm about to reorder and start a new batch since she liked it so much.  I'm just throwing this review up here so other inexperienced growers like me can hopefully avoid the same mistake!

review/text: When we took in our first cat I had no idea that cats crave greens naturally.  Until one day I noticed my plants were all chewed up and bits & pieces were all over the carpet.  So I tried this Bellrock pet greens and now our cat won't eat his food without it!  I just trim some of the grass and sprinkle on top of his meal.  It's super easy to grow and one package lasts me about 15 days.  Super!

review/summary: Surprisingly Great
review/text: My wife bought this at a store as an impulse buy.  It was cheap, so no big deal, but I had doubts that it would grow since we live in an apartment with only a small balcony that doesn't get much light.<br /><br />I did not do a great job planting either.  I grabbed a clump of dirt off the top, poured in the seeds, and threw the clump of dirt back down on top.  Noticing it was probably too deep for the seeds, I shook the bag.  Most of the seeds ended up on top.  I figured it was a lost cause, maybe a couple strands would grow.<br /><br />4 days later, I noticed several grass stalks (this WITHOUT being in the sun, mind you).  Once the stalks got above the height of the bag I put it outside where it gets maybe 3 hours of light...and a week later it was flourishing!<br /><br />This stuff is incredibly thick, not browning at all, and incredibly strong.  Our cat loves it (and no, she hasn't thrown up from eating it, which was our main concern).<br /><br />I am very glad my wife purchased this stuff.  I always felt bad that our cat, who was probably a stray for many years and used to the outdoors before we adopted her, was cooped up in an apartment.  Now she can at least enjoy getting a bit of sun and nibbling on some fresh plants.

review/text: I tried to follow the directions on the package to the letter.  However, I was not really able to cover up the seeds since the soil was already in the container.  I mixed them around some and so some were covered and some were not.  Despite that, the grass grew quickly and richly.  I just kept it moist at all times and out of the sun for the first few days (until the sprouts were about an inch high) and then in sunlight the rest of the time.  It has been wonderful.<br /><br />Our cats love it and both take turns attacking it.  They can't get enough.

However, whenever she'd eaten a plant, my cat would always end up throwing it up because she couldn't digest it. I thought that she would be able eat and digest this product since it's "pet greens garden wheat grass." I had no problem with the growing of the grass. Actually, it grew beautifully (took about 5 days to really start growing out of the bag). However, my cat cannot digest this grass either. Multiple times now she has eaten some grass only to throw it up about 5 mins later. I am somewhat disappointed in the product.

I was amazed!<br /><br />When I'm home I put the bag on the kitchen table and the kitties jump up and nibble on the blades of grass.  They seem to like it OK, but it seems to be more curiosity than anything else.<br /><br />I looked up whether humans can eat the grass, too, because wheat grass is full of beneficial nutrients.  So far I've gotten both yes and no, so I plan to research it more.  If I can eat this stuff I'll be psyched!  Easiest gardening ever.<br /><br />Gave it four stars because the cats don't love it and it's more of a novelty item.  But it's cheap and easy enough and fun to watch them play with it, so why not?

It doesn't say how much to give them, so it's a guess, unless you ask your vet, but they aren't suppose to eat too much - whatever that would be.  It's been a couple of weeks and the grass is not as healthy green looking so I guess it won't last, but I would say it was worth it.

review/text: We have a White Shepherd that loves eating grass and since you never know what is sprayed on that grass, we bought this as special treat for her.  The kit grew very well and continues now for several weeks.  However, other than to dig it up and play with the dirt, she really won't eat the grass like she does outside.  She will eat it if we mix it with her food, but she still eats the outdoor stuff.  HOWEVER, this is NOT the products fault.  This kit does just what it says it will do, grows well and easy.  She eats it, but not from the pot.  So I don't blame the product for her choice, I just find it comical!  (She probaly wouldn't use a pet treadmill either!) :)

review/summary: Amazing customer service
review/text: When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert "3-4 mm" to inches and consequently discovered the "Coarse Grinder Salt" was almost 1/4" (1/6" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!

review/summary: Product changed....
review/text: This product seems to have replaced a similar previous product (Natural Himalayan Crystal Salt). The previous prodcut was a deeper pink color and the texture was better than what I was finding elsewhere. This new product (Himalayan Organic Natural Unprocessed Cooking Salt) is much more like what the competitors are selling. I've enjoyed all my products from The Spice Lab, but was disappointed with the replacent for this product.

review/summary: Great salt
review/text: This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a "rounded" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference.

review/summary: For more than salting foods.
review/text: Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet, and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron.

review/summary: Fluoride Content An Issue?
review/text: Not sure, but have been reading about Himalayan salt and apparently there is a high fluoride in this salt according to several reviews I've read, and that's not so good.  However, it looks very nice in my salt mill and tastes much better than Morton salt and I don't use it everyday.  Also, it's mined in Pakistan if that really matters.

review/summary: super fast shipping, free samples
review/text: placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping; super faster. the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me. in addition, it came with 3 samples (himalayan salt, lemon citron flake salt, and cyprus white flake salt) weighing quite a few grams each (sorry, doesn't say the weight and i don't have a scale with me at the moment).<br /><br />as far as product quality goes, i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods. i haven't tasted it yet, but i bet it tastes like salt. of course price wise this salt (the spice lab) is WAY cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods (even including shipping).

review/text: This is the first time I have used land mined salt.  I usually use salt from various sea sources.  After reading several reviews here on Amazon I decided to try this salt.  I was very pleasantly surprised the first time I tasted the salt. The flavor was fresh and subtle.  Not like the salt you usually buy in the grocery stores. Plus it has a lot of trace minerals your body needs.  I highly recommend this salt.

review/summary: the only salt I use--except herbamare and trocomare
review/text: I have not purchased this from Amazon yet as still on what I purchased elsewhere BUT I noticed many people buying the one pound bag. Just to let you know: one kilo equals 2.2 lbs. Why would you buy the one pound bag on something that never goes bad when you can get more than double for just a few dollars more.<br /><br />Dr. Mercola's comments regarding Himalaya salt benefits are what started me using this initially a few years ago. Many micronutrients, great purity. One person questioned the iodine: no salt naturally contains iodine unless it is iodized or contains some sort of seaweed. You can easily see his comments at mercola.com.<br /><br />Himalaya salt has a very 'clean' taste--add at the end of cooking.

review/text: This salt is so tasty!  It tastes nothing like the iodized table salt.  This has a light, mild taste that greatly enhances meats, vegetables, etc.  It's pink/peach color also looks very pretty in my clear Cole/Mason grinder.  It grinds very finely with no issue.  In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.  If you're a neat freak, this might bug you a little and you might find yourself wiping out the top of the grinder.  Great salt and the bag lasts a long time.

I don't know if it tastes any different from regular table salt but I think there is something about the shape of the crystals that changes the way the salt hits your tongue. If you have a good grinder I highly recommend checking this stuff out.

I have fairly large/strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult/impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon).

review/summary: SALT OF THE EARTH - Himalayan Style
review/text: Silly me, I didn't even know there was such a thing as pink Himalayan salt.  A friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style.  So now, it's like buying a red, Ford Mustang.  It's all you see on the road or, in this case, on the shelves of the stores.<br /><br />I'm actually glad I purchased this and have stopped using regular old white salt almost totally.  The salt does seem to have a milder taste but I don't find myself using any more of it than I did with the good old "when it rains it pours" variety.<br /><br />Since ordering this from Amazon, I've managed to find some here in my little town but it is way expensive.  When you purchase this you will also need a salt grinder unless you like throwing big chunks of salt at your food.  Worth getting the two together, however, especially if you purchase a grinder with a glass container as the salt really looks attractive in a pretty, transparent grinder.  And, of course, it tastes good, too.  About it's nutritional value I admit to knowing zip.  Does salt HAVE nutritional value?  In the meantime, I give this four stars.  If I find out more about the actual food value I'll update this review.

review/summary: Distinctive, great-flavored Japanese tea
review/text: *****<br />Ashby's Japanese Green Tea is a distinctive, strong, great-flavored Japanese tea. Nothing wimpy or mild about it, and I'm glad, because it's so enjoyable. I made a large thermos with one tea bag, left the tea bag in, and drank it for several hours, and it never got bitter. I then made more tea with the same tea bag. The flavor is definitely Asian and I could drink cup after cup. It smells great, too.<br /><br />Ashby's of London writes this about Japanese Green Tea: "From Japan, this pan-fired tea is lightly rolled and dried over a fire in a large flat bottom pan. This tea contains the desirable "Polyphenols" that have been reported to be a cancer fighting substance. It has a very light, fresh taste and produces a transparent greenish colored brew." I agree, but please note that the tea is distinctively flavored, not mild (which I really like) and delivers a wonderful tea experience.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, and if you enjoy Asian teas, or want a true green tea, you'll not go wrong here.<br />*****

review/summary: I may never "cook" again!
review/text: OMG, I can't believe the variety of these "Sides" that Lipton has to offer. After devouring the tasty Stroganoff Side, I just had to try another "stick-to-your-ribs" meal, so I went for this Rice Medley.<br /><br />At the risk of sounding like a glutton, I'm going to confess I made those little, impolite moaning sounds while eating this dish ... but who wouldn't? The flavor of this yummy rice dish is enhanced by vermicelli, dried peas, carrots, and onions in chicken-flavored sauce.  Mmmmmm ... Oops, there I go again! (Well, at least I'm not burping. ... lol)<br /><br />Oh-hhh, I see other tempting varieties: Asian Sides, Fiesta Sides and more, and all just as easy to prepare as the Stroganoff (see previous review).<br /><br />Excuse me, I'm off to the kitchen again. These are so easy, so delicious, I may never "cook" again.<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />author of: Millennium Babe: The Prophecy

review/summary: Very good flavor
review/text: I just used these in a beef stew last night and was very pleased with the tomato flavor they added to the stew. The tomatoes themselves are about twice the diameter of grape or cherry tomatoes. My wife just picked them out of the can one by one, mashed each with thumb and forefinger, and dropped them into the stew. Without peels, they cooked down and just became part of the stock.<br /><br />You can buy these with and without basil added. It looks like a couple of people who reviewed here were shipped the SKU with basil by mistake, and instead of handling their problem with customer service, blamed it on the product. Here's what you do if someone ships you the wrong product. Instead of mis-targeting the product, call customer service and tell them to send the right product, and send a shipping label to return the wrong one. If they won't do that, call your credit card company and deny the charge. It is that simple.

I did not have problems with getting a different kind of tomato than I'd ordered -- I got the regular whole peeled tomatoes. As for the cans being dented, sure, a couple of them are bound to get dented considering it's TWENTY POUNDS OF CANS BEING SHIPPED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. A couple dents are to be expected, folks.<br /><br />Overall, it's really tough to complain about this (though the price does seem to have jumped since I ordered them ... too bad.)

review/summary: A Basket of Grapes in a Bag
review/text: We like raisins (Sun Maid Raisins, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)), and if you knew how many we eat, you would be shocked. We eat them on our cold cereal, in our oatmeal, mixed with almonds, stirred up with peanut butter, and by themselves.<br /><br />They are good to eat and good for people. They are pure food . . . "grapes and sunshine" Sun-Maid calls them.  They are made in California's San Joaquin Valley from Thompson Seedless grapes.  One pound of raisins is 4 � pounds of fresh grapes.  The hot summer sun makes the grapes sweet and juicy.<br /><br />In addition to snacking on raisins, we like to cook with them.<br /><br />Here's a classic recipe using raisins. My sister Ruth won a prize with it in a cooking show, and she shared it with permission in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook.<br /><br />Ruth's Prize-Winning Broccoli Salad<br />4 cups broccoli<br />� cup raisins<br />� cup onion<br />� cup nuts<br />� cup celery<br />� cup real bacon bits<br />� cup light mayonnaise<br />� cup sugar<br />� cup vinegar (apple cider or white)<br /><br />Mix the first 6 ingredients.  Make a sauce out of the mayonnaise, sugar, and vinegar.  Pour the sauce over the salad. Toss and chill.<br /><br />Lately we are paying more attention to nutrition.  Raisns have 130 calories in a 1/4 cup serving.  There are condensed food.  They contain no fat. They have natural sugar with a large carbohydrate load.  One serving has almost no sodium but 310 mg potassium.  Diabetics and renal patients should consult with their dieticians before including raisins in their diets.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy Ruth's recipe and find this review helpful.

review/summary: Fantastic Raisins in a Convenient Package
review/text: Sun Maid raisins are delicious.  They are plump, moist, flavorful, grown in the USA and have no added ingredients or sugar.  Really, the ingredients list on the package has only one ingredient:  California seedless raisins.<br /><br />There has always been one big problem with Sun Maid Raisins:  their packaging.  It used to be that the raisins were packed in cardboard cartons that didn't seal or re-seal well and the raisins would dry out and get unappetizing, especially when they got smushed, stuck or smeared onto the cardboard package.<br /><br />Happily, Sun Maid has finally found the perfect solution to their packaging problem.  These 12 ounce pouches are wonderful!  They contain a reasonably small quantity of raisins (about enough for a big batch of oatmeal raisin cookies) and are resealable too, so it's no big deal if you don't finish the whole packet at once.

Half way through mountain biking, surfing, step master, weightlifting, hiking etc. when I stop and want to insure that I have the right energy, I feed my body hot tea with raisins, grapefruit, banana, etc. since the potassium keeps my muscles flexible and the natural sugar in the fruit itself, gives me an immediate glucose which burns immediately and turns into energy and most importantly it tastes great. I keep the big bag in the refrigerator inside another zip lock bag and only take what I need on weekly basis even though I consume this frequently and need to purchase another bag every month.

review/summary: Good food; good snacks !!!
review/text: Sun Maid Raisins provide an excellent snack for persons on the go who want quick energy; they are also healthy for just about anyone, too. They are fat and cholesterol free and they don't have sodium. Raisins contain dietary fiber as well. Moreover, just 1.5 ounces equals one serving of the fruit we need to have in our diets every day. Excellent!<br /><br />The packaging allows for easy transport and the stay fresh reclosable zipper works well. If for some reason the zipper on your bag doesn't work then use a tie from a loaf of bread or something similar to keep the package closed.<br /><br />Moreover, Amazon correctly notes that these raisins are delicious with yogurt and cereal. They can be used in salads and numerous other recipes, too. I add them to hot oatmeal in the morning to give the otherwise bland oatmeal a natural sweetness that wakes up my taste buds big time! SMILES<br /><br />Unfortunately, raisins contain few vitamins and they do contain some carbohydrates. Amazon also notes that these raisins "may contain an occasional grape stem or wood piece." Consult your doctor if this concerns you. I wish they contained vitamins; this disappoints me so I will take off one star to make this a four star review.<br /><br />Overall, however, Sun Maid raisins provide us with a healthy alternative to candy bars and junk food when we need that snack or burst of sugar energy. They help us get the fruit we so badly need in our diets and the packaging allows us to carry them around easily.<br /><br />Buy some like I did and ENJOY!!!

In contrast, raisins from sun maid bought at local stores were always good. I was unpleasantly surprised therefore to find the raisins that arrived with my order to be these same clumps of dry, low quality type of raisins as those no brand discount raisins sold in some food markets. I'm sure they still good for cooking but not for eating out of a bag. Very disappointing.

The description does warn against occasional stems or wood pieces, but I was sure surprised when I nearly broke my molars on a stone about the size of a raisin.  I wrote the company to see if they wanted to examine the stone or the package of raisins, but never received a response.<br /><br />These raisins are very tasty, but I have to give a one star rating based on Sun-Maid's poor customer service.  A solution is to eat them one at a time, inspecting each one prior, but what about oatmeal raisin cookies?  I am not sure I will ever be able to eat these raisins with the enthusiasm I used to have.

review/summary: A very sensitive stomach is settled. Waggy Tails!
review/text: Our poor little pooch (ok, ok ... a big ol slobbery mess) had some serious stomach issues since we moved to the city from 4 acres of freedom. We tried everything to help her adjust, including altering her diet. Adding small amounts of oatmeal and rice to her regular food helped, but we kept having to increase the portions. Eventually, she was eating too much people food, and not enough dog food. We knew it was doubtful that it was a medical problem because of prior history of stress induced digestive issues. Not only that, she always had a fussy stomach to begin with (already vet checked). Nonetheless, we were beginning to get worried.<br /><br />Finally, on a hunch, I visited a local family owned pet store down the street. The kid there obviously knew his stuff, and the products. I explained the situation, and he recommended California Natural. I never wanted to try this brand because of the price but I decided to trust him.<br /><br />Well, the problem cleared up completely in less than 2 days. There was very little, if any, transition period between her old food and California Natural. The, ahem, results (if you will) are now normal, occur less frequently, and compact (sorry to be gross.)<br /><br />At first, I was worried about the cost. I realize now, a resulting vet bill could cost far more. I am now looking at this as a preventative measure; an investment into her health and longevity. If we had started her on California Natural at the beginning, she probably wouldn't have the "fussy stomach" I mentioned earlier. Not only that, we might have saved countless dollars, hassle, discomfort, and emotional distress by avoiding trips to the vet.<br /><br />The food satisfies her, she loves it, and it is gentle on her stomach. And, I am told, it is healthy stuff. All I can say is - hallelujah!<br /><br />Thanks guys -<br /><br />- from Sandy the pooch<br /><br />(and us)<br /><br /> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XLVBU">California Natural Lamb Meal and Rice Adult Dry Dog Food</a>
