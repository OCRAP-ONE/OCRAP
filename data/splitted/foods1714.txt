review/summary: Juicy, fruity flavor
review/text: This tea is yummy!  Unlike many of their fruit flavored teas, this one has no licorice in it (yeah!).<br /><br />Smooth berry flavors, but not too strong on any one flavor.  It gets better as it sits.  It can steep for a long time and not get bitter at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Best Peppermint Tea We Have Found
review/text: My husband has IBS and peppermint tea is essential to managing his condition. We have tried a variety of the peppermint teas commonly found in our local supermarkets and none of them come close to the quality and effectiveness of Stash Peppermint Tea. We were happy to be able to get it in bulk from Amazon.com.

review/summary: Fruit-Flavoured Tea
review/text: Stash is a very good quality, full-bodied tea and I am a big-time tea drinker.  I have been drinking tea since probably before Superman was born.  I like to keep a bunch of different flavoured teas around, especially some fruity flavours.  I call them dessert teas because I usually don't eat dessert, but I like to have a fruit tea after dinner.  Stash tea bags are usually, if not always, individually sealed in a foil-type packet, so the flavour stays fresh for a long time.<br /><br />The acai berry flavor is delicious!  It has a nice natural sweetness and a very fruity taste.  It is very smooth and is a caffeine free herbal tea.  The 100% natural ingredients, listed in this order, are: hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, orange peel, chicory root, blackberry flavor, blackcurrant flavor, acai flavor, acai fruit powder, and licorice powder.  Contains soy.

review/summary: One caveat...
review/text: This tea is great! It is very sweet on its own- I like to alternate drinking it with sips of water, which makes the licorice flavor even more pronounced!<br /><br />Just use caution if you have high blood pressure or glaucoma. Licorice root can raise blood pressure. I don't have either condition, but after finding that out, decided that this was better as an occasional treat (as opposed to a daily ritual.)

review/summary: Fresh ginger & mellow lemon
review/text: This herbal tea is well balanced and pleasant.  It tastes to me like good real lemon, but not acidic.  The ginger seems just enough.  Bonus; you can use the bag twice and get a good cup of tea the second time.  Also, it's nice to steep this with black tea, and get a bit of caffeine if you choose, along with the ginger / lemon flavors.

review/text: This is my 'go to' tea out of all the tea brands and flavors I have tried. I average two of these tea bags at my office every day. I particularly like the fresh blend in Stash brand and I think this particular brand makes superior mint tea over other fancy tea brands. My husband and I each have a box in our separate offices and a box at home at all times. Yes, it really is that good- just try it and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />On a related note- we have tried the Moroccan Mint bags and the Premium Peppermint is much better.

review/text: My favorite tea is raspberry flavor and I have tried every one I have found in the stores. This one is by far my favorite! The flavors are so sweet and I have been able to give up coffee for this one! This is a great price too if you buy two 6-packs you save the shipping. At my local store I can get this tea for $0.15 per bag but on here it works out to $0.11 per bag, which would save me $9.60 on that amount of bags.

review/summary: Best unsung home remedy
review/text: I never liked the flavor of this tea initially, and had a box sitting in the back of my cupboard for over a year, until I discovered its use as a home remedy.  It is soothing to the throat and digestive system, and contains natural expectorants and antispasmodics.  As such, I've found it to be a great reliever for coughs, cold or allergy symptoms such as congestion and sneezing, and even painful periods. Today I swear by this stuff and always have to have a box around for sickness. I've thrown away all my cold medicines and cough syrups, the natural herbs in this tea are better for you and almost as effective without the side effects of drowsiness or confusion. Not a doctor, just a happy customer.

review/summary: Nice tea
review/text: I have been drinking this tea for some time.  I happen to like Chamomile teas they are very a mild, I do not like teas that are to strong.  One bag is enough or me I can put it in a cup of hot water and leave the bag in without worrying if it was to get too strong like other teas do.  Adding just a little raw honey enhances the flavor also.<br />I enjoy this tea before I go to bed and it has a very soothing and the warmth of the liquid allows me to slip into a nice sleep.<br /><br />I like the convenience of a foil package, I can carry one or two with me when I go out to lunch with friends, I just order a cup of hot water and slip this tea into it.<br />I have on occasion I have put this is a cup with some fresh ginger and it makes a totally different tea, and he ginger helps sooth the tummy while the Chamomile tends to relax you.<br />Doesn't get much better than this.

review/summary: Sweet and Lovely Tea
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Licorice Spice Caffeine Free Herbal Tea has a the sweet flavor licorice teas are known for, along with several nice spices that complement the licorice in a lovely, more-subtle-than-chai way. Licorice Spice Tea contains licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise, sarsaparilla, natural vanilla flavor, natural orange flavor, natural clove flavor, natural cardamom flavor, and natural cinnamon flavor. Sweet and delicious!<br /><br />You don't need to add anything at all to Licorice Spice Tea, even if you normally like your tea sweetened. It is perfect just as is. It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Yum for Yumberry!
review/text: I don't think I ever heard of "yumberry" flavor before, but it is yummy!  As I have said before, I am a big time tea drinker and Stash makes excellent teas.<br /><br />This one has a smooth, fruity, berry taste and is sweet and delicious.  It would be great served alone, after dinner, or with a piece of good quality cheesecake.  Although I am drinking it warm, it would likely taste great as an ice tea, too.<br /><br />If you want to sweeten it, I suggest natural brown sugar, honey, or agave cactus juice (natural food isle in supermarket).  For this one, I used 2 bags for 24 oz hot water.<br /><br />As with all Stash teas, each bag is sealed in its own foil pouch to protect its delicate flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients, in order listed, are: hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, yumberry flavor, chicory root, blackcurrant flavor, blackcurrant powder, and licorice powder.  Contains soy.  It is a 100 % natural, herbal, caffeine free product.

review/text: Best chamomile on the mainstream supermarket shelves. Other chamomile teas have had a bitter aftertaste, but this one by Stash is really smooth and fresh. It's neither strong nor bland, just floral and pleasant. Reminds me slightly of chrysanthemum. It doesn't make me sleepy or keep me up, for what it's worth. I had some primo stuff at a local coffeeshop that tasted much like the Stash brand, but had an awesome citrusy floral aroma; been wanting to find something like that for a while, and so far this Stash Chamomile comes closest.

review/text: This tea is really tasty...I wasn't even a tea person until tasting this, and once I did, I was hooked. The flavor is light and super-refreshing but you can still taste and smell the mint. The only reason why I took off one star is because I tend to like things that taste strongly, and this one is a little bit delicate for me. To remedy that, I either steep it with hibiscus or black tea, or I steep it at double strength and all is well.<br />Putting it with honey and stevia also tastes great, and makes me feel better when I have colds. I love this tea!

review/text: This is the first camomile tea that actually maintains the most of the medicinal properties of camomile!! So far it is the best out of five different brands we got to try in USA including various organic, so called farmaceutic quality, etc.. To give a specific example of this tea's well-preserved qualities: it really helps us get rid of extra water in our bodies, nearly as good as "water pills"  doctors recommend. One packet in a small cup does great.. And can be repeated if you need.  We have subscribed to receive it from Amazon on a regular basis - the price is better then in a supermarket.

review/summary: Absolutely the best tea I've ever had
review/text: I'm not a big tea drinker. I keep buying different types of tea convinced I'll like them, and each one turns out to be completely different than I anticipated. In other words, I think all teas taste generally the same: like hot water. Even with sugar - then they taste like hot water with sugar. But this tea is completely different.<br /><br />I love licorice. This tastes exactly like licorice. It smells like licorice (clearly from the anise, since licorice root basically smells like cooked bark). It doesn't need sugar. It's sweet. It has an 'aftertaste' of licorice. In other words, it's perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately no store I've ever been to has carried it, although I look EVERY TIME I walk down the tea aisle. Even if they did, it wouldn't be that awesome, since this is pretty much the same exact price it would go for in, say, Target. Unfortunately it is 6 boxes...but I really don't think you can have enough of this stuff.<br /><br />After some trial-and-error, I can now say that, of the few other licorice teas that do exist, nothing really comes close to Stash. I've tried a weird Celestial tea  mix of  licorice root + 3 other things (tastes like hot water), Batavia Anise tea (hot water with a licorice aroma), and store brand Albrecht Heijn Zoethout tea (from the Netherlands - smells like hot bark but tastes exactly like this tea. Unfortunately it's completely nonexistent here.) What I've discovered on my quest fs that only a few brands even attempt to make JUST licorice tea (it's not popular here, and it baffles me that people don't appreciate the taste), and of those only Stash is successful.<br /><br />Buy it. Amazon is a good deal and it's soooo good.

review/summary: Different and Tasty
review/text: I am a tea drinker from way back and Stash is an excellent tea.  This flavor has a smooth strawberry/pomegranate taste and is delicious.  It is a red tea (red in colour) and red because its primary ingredient is Rooibos, which is red tea and is slightly sweet.  Also included (in this order) are rosehips, hibiscus flowers, raspberry leaves, citric acid, and strawberry flavour and pomegranate flavour.<br /><br />I did some research on the health benefits of some of these ingredients.  This info is what I found reported in a few different sources:<br /><br />Rooibus tea:<br />Rooibus tea is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids and is reported to have 50 times more antioxidant power than green tea. It also has other antioxidants not found in other teas.  The effect of free radicals in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the antioxidants in Rooibus tea.  Rooibus tea is completely pure and natural .  It contains no additives, preservatives or colorant.  It is strongly recommended for those suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension.  It has no caffeine and so has a soothing effect on the central nervous system.  Rooibus tea is low in tannin and so it does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.  It has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants.  It also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, hearrtburn, stomach ulcers and constipation. It supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and flouride, and it contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid. I was also told that red tea does not have ECOG, a healthful property that green tea does have. That is why I drink both red tea and green tea, to get the best of all worlds.<br /><br />Rosehips is supposed to be good for infections, bladder problems, and diarrhea and also a good source of vitamin C.<br />Hibiscus flowers is supposed to be a diuretic (fluid release) and reported to help lower high blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />If I had only two words to describe the taste of this tea, they would be fruity and smooth.  It is also caffeine free.  It is a nice change of pace from standard flavors and a nice after-dinner comfort drink.  Stash makes a good full bodied tea, stronger than some of these cheapie teas, so I find I only need one bag per a 24 oz cup. (Of course, that all depends on your preference.)  These special Stash flavors are a little hard to find because many stores do not carry them unless they have a super large tea display.<br /><br />BTW--I am not a doctor--(my disclaimer)--just someone who has done a lot of reading on alternative health care.

review/text: Stash's Cinnamon Apple Chamomile is a comforting blend of apples, hibiscus, chamomile and cinnamon. I use two teabags per cup as it gives the tea a much more full-bodied flavor. I've tasted quite a few cinnamon-apple teas and this one is my favorite. There is not too much cinnamon and just enough apple flavor. It is even more delicious when sweetened with a huckleberry honey. You will want to drink this tea while decorating for Christmas or while eating a piece of cake. This tea is especially good with the Butter Rum Cake from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811867811">All Cakes Considered</a>.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I bought this to compliment my growing Stash Tea collection at the office. Like my friends they expected a sharp lemon taste with this tea however upon trying it you notice the ginger seems to have the stronger taste. I like the tea though - it is a strong tea (former black coffee drinker here) if you let it sit for awhile. Definitely recommend.

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry Delight
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: What's With the Weird Sensation Seconds After Sipping?
review/text: I bought a box of this herbal tea at my local grocery store and highly recommend trying a smaller quantity before committing to 6 boxes of it here.  Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor "blossomed" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea "dances around the sides of your tongue."  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the "flavor burst", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The "flavor burst" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil.

review/summary: Stashed Premium Chamomile Herbash
review/text: After a lengthy trek in the Himalayan Range, the Himalayas, or Himalayalabalyakamonkatonka for short, in Tibetan, (a mountain range in Asia, separating the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau), I was in bad shape.  First of all, my scrotum shrunk from the extended lack of healthy oxygen.  Secondly, I had all sorts of intestinal problems due to my diet of yak meat only.  Thirdly, I had plenty of holes in my socks and underpants.<br /><br />I eventually made it to a small town in China where I visited the local Apothecary.  A man, if I recall correctly, by the name of Ying Yang Ping Pong Luke, recommended Chamomile Herbal Tea.  I had often heard of the healing properties of it in old and ancient Zulu scripts (pictographic and ideographic) but had never tried it since I despised teas.<br /><br />Well, after a few months on a Chamomile Herbal Tea only diet plus brown rice, I was fixed up.  Chamomiles are medicinal plants.  They are  emmenagogues, stomachics, carminatives, diaphoretics, antispasmodics, and sedatives.<br /><br />In my case, Chamomile Herbal Tea fought intestinal gas and stimulated my gastric juices and encouraged my appetite.<br /><br />Stash Premium Chamomile Herbal Tea is very weak so some won't like it.  I do because you can drink a nice hot cup before bed and it helps you.  It has no flavor aside from a bitter taste of weed but again, I think of it more as a comfort Tea than something pleasurable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HFBMQ">Neti Pot Starter Kit with 1.5 Oz Aromatic Salt Original Neti Pot Salt</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I21K18">Adagio Teas PersonaliTea 21-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basket</a><br /><br />Nature's Way - Chamomile Flowers, 350 mg, 100 capsules

The hibiscus is great for your kidneys.<br />The flavor is great hot or cold. If you are wondering what this tastes like, if you have tried Starbucks' "Berry Berry Hibiscus" drink and liked it then you will like this also as the flavor is quite similar.

review/text: I decided to be risky and order a big box on unknown tea - this stuff, along with big boxes of Blueberry and Raspberry.  The other teas were better than expected - but this stuff was just plain unflavorful and weird tasting.  Couldn't taste the strawberry.  Perhaps the weird taste is the Rooibos in the tea.  I have to be sure to never buy a rooibos based tea again, although the stuff is supposed to be good for you.<br /><br />I drink my tea iced and always brew a bag of plain ol green tea in with the herb bags, but I don't think the green tea messed this tea up.  When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'.  I was right.<br /><br />Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers.

review/summary: I'm Wild for this Wild Raspberry Tea
review/text: Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon's convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.

I have tasted other brands that have a stronger ginger taste than Stash but they've also had a strange taste to them as well so so far Stash is my favorite. This tea is great for upset tummy.

I mix it double-strength in a tall clear glass with 12 ounces of water. I like to watch it change color for five minutes, then I sip it and enjoy the sweet relief. The flavor is lemony, but not overly so, with a good ginger kick. Caffeine free. Excellent. I'd recommend this over Tums or Nasty Bismo any day, and it works better too. Peppermint tea and licorice tea are also good choices for indigestion. Also look into digestive enzymes.

I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/summary: Really great tasting tea.
review/text: I purchased this tea for a neighbor when she had mentioned that she loved the taste. I then went and purchased a pack of 120 (a bit much, I know) but it was totally worth it. The tea has a spicy, yet citrus-y taste that is both refreshing and aromatic. I highly recommend this tea for anyone whom is looking for a new 'everyday' flavor of tea.

review/text: bland, and boring... thick crust.<br /><br />My daughter wouldn't eat the fish at all due to the trout's skin which has a slimy consistency.<br /><br />The fish had no flavor and no texture.  The crust is like a big, thick blanket of a pre- processed mashed up casing, not a traditional bread crumb / with cheese topping.  It has no texture and the flavor is lacking.

review/text: We were excited to find a source of Patak Balti Sauce, a cooking ingredient, in the US, and ordered some jars.  We were notified that they had been shipped, and given an arrival date approximation, but they never arrived.  A few weeks later, we received an email from Amazon telling us that the item was out of stock and that we would have the cost refunded.  We did receive the refund. We wish we had been told at the outset that the item was not available.

review/summary: Good taste, hard to dissolve, Red 40 :(
review/text: I have no complaint in the taste. It tastes great, strong enough so I feel like I actually had a treat, but not so heavy that the sweetness is a turn off. It's also very portable and easy to pour into a bottle of water. I plan to keep a few of these in my car for when I need something to add to water. Super easy.<br /><br />I do, however, have two complaints. It never dissolves totally. I have shaken the life out of a bottle of water and not had any luck. It just won't dissolve. And it's not just a little, there are clumps left. I can dissolve a little more once the bottle is half full and I really shake it hard.<br /><br />My other complaint is that it uses Red 40 for coloring. Sigh. I had hopes that I could use these with my kids, but I have one that's sensitive to Red Dye 40. In fact, there are a whole lot of people that are. I was hoping that a larger company like Kellog would lead the charge and getting rid of some of this junk for our children's diets. Alas, not.

review/summary: Keeps me full and hydrated, too
review/text: My body and I have a love-hate relationship since I wish I was tall and slim and it has been determined to be short and chubby since birth. This powder gives me protein and fiber to help me stay full (and not snack) which is a good thing. I prefer this flavor to the pink lemonade since the latter is a bit too tart. I buy it by the case on the subscribe-and-save program and keep cases of it at home and at work and order a lot during the summer since it seems to go out-of-stock during the winter.

review/summary: A Must Have!
review/text: My husband and I have been trying to conceive now for about a year and failed. My gyno has recently put me on a 180g high protein diet regimen to assist.<br /><br />So the search was on... to find the best tasting, low calorie, inexpensive product I won't get tired of.<br /><br />Just like the previous posts, I found this product in the protein/diet isle.<br /><br />It is absolutely amazing! I am going to try them all. Zero protein taste or aftertaste, AND only 30 calories. I agree, it needs to be cold, but it is just fine room temp (which is more than I can say for most protein mixes).<br /><br />The unfortunate part is that it is only 5g of protein. Every little bit helps me get to the 180g mark, so no complaining here. :)<br /><br />Happy shopping!

review/summary: Does not dissolve in water!
review/text: On the positive side, the taste of this product is OK.  Tart, yet sweet.  The package says it contains 20% Daily Value of fiber, and 10% DV of protein.  Then it adds lots of artificial ingredients and food coloring to the mix.  My main problem with it (other than the ingredients list) is that it does not dissolve in water.  Something  advertised as a "Protein Water Mix" should dissolve in water!!! Another small gripe, while I'm at it- each serving is in a skinny straw-like package with a tear off opening- that does not open wide enough to let the powder sprinkle out- so I have to find a pair of scissors to open it enough to use it- making it impractical for on the road.<br /><br />I finally found another use for the five and a half boxes I had left of the stuff after giving up on the protein water idea. I add about a third of a package to a container of plain yogurt or kefir.  After a minute or two it is completely dissolved and has added a little sweetness and nutrition for an added ten calories.  I'm not sure why it dissolves better in these products than in water, but it may be because it is a whey based protein.

review/text: Not sure if this is true in all stores, but I found the K20 in the "diet" section of the store, not with the other powdered drink mixes.  I'd actually given up on finding it and was on my way to get tylenol...one wrong turn down the pharmacy isle and there it was!<br /><br />That being said it tastes great and will go a looooong way in ensure that I drink enough water every day.  I have never found a diet drink that I like (and I've tried them all) because of the after taste but I must admit that to me, the K20 doesn't have an aftertaste.  I've only tried the Strawberry Kiwi flavor but so far so good!

review/text: I bought this product because I missed the old product from Kellogg's with the 10 grams of fiber that was discontinued. I believe it was called Kellogg's All Bran Fiber Mix.  I like the taste of this drink mix, and will continue to use it, but it only has 5 grams of fiber--although it also has 5 grams of protein.  I would prefer the discontinued drink mix because of the higher fiber content.  I do like the Strawberry Kiwi flavor.

review/text: I lost 80 pounds in 8 months, and I could not have done it without K2o! It's the perfect pick-me-up to get over that 3:00PM slump between lunch and supper. I first learned about this product from my gastroenterologist, who allowed me to have the tropical flavor when I was on liquids preparatory to a colonoscopy. Now my household is never without it, and I carry the "stick shaped" pouches in my purse (fits great into the mouth of a bottle of water, just shake & you have an instant "snack"). I also keep it in my car, along with bottles of water. It's better ice cold, but it's not bad at room temperature and can get you over an unexpected slump.

If I don't like it, I won't eat it. I like the addition of whey protein because I can drink this, which stops the cravings, to avoid overeating between meals. Otherwise, I still prefer plain water. It has a tart/sweet taste and it helps me with my weight management.

review/text: really nice tea, and smells wonderful. I enjoy it with a teaspoon of "sugar in the raw."  Stores well as is wrapped in foil. I usually buy the box of 100 teabags since it is an excellent value

review/summary: A ginormous box of 1,000 tea bags
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile. I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you really, truly like chamomile tea, or own a restaurant, this ginormous box of 1,000 single-serving tea bags is a good choice.

review/summary: Stash Chocolate Mint tea
review/text: Fast shipping. Smells good when you open the tea bag - tastes like watered down coffee with a faint mint aftertaste. Not recommended.

review/summary: the best
review/text: Hands down the best strawberry jelly I've ever tasted. It will most likely be all I'll buy from now on. It's not overly sweet, which is nice.

review/summary: Sadly made in China
review/text: I bought the crackers for my baby son and he LOVED them. I liked very much that the ingredient list is so short. But then I discovered that the crackers are made in China - stopped giving them to my son and threw them all out. After all the lead in toys for children and melanin in baby milk, I just try to buy as little as possible that is made in China - and definitely nothing that my son will eat! If these crackers were made in the USA, I would totally recommend and buy them again.

review/summary: Made in China- won't buy again
review/text: I saw "Japonica rice" and made the mistake of thinking these were made in Japan.  Realized they are actually made in China.  I avoid buying anything made in China, if possible, because of the political ramifications, but particularly avoid buying products for my infant made in China because of the safety issues.<br /><br />My daughter did enjoy these, but I won't be buying them again.
