review/summary: The Best of Its Kind
review/text: this is by far the best of its kind!  if you want a good cup of coffee/espresso quick and easy, caffe d'vita espresso is the way to go.  i've searched everywhere and tried many different kinds of instant coffee and instant espresso (there are fewer of these), but nothing beats the taste of this.

review/summary: Caffe D'Vita Instant Espresso vs. Medaglia D' Oro Instant Espresso
review/text: I love coffee, but I also love not having to be messing with the coffee maker sometimes. This instant espresso is one of the best I have tried. I rarely drink instant espresso plain; I mainly use it in iced coffee drinks, frappes or mochas.<br /><br />I also have the Medaglia D' Oro Instant Espresso in our pantry and it is wonderful as well, but with less bite that the Caffe D'Vita supplies.  I like to use the Caffe D'Vita when I want a pronounced java edge and the Medaglia D' Oro when a delicate espresso flavor is needed.<br /><br />Neither brand is acidic at all, I find that if I drink it on an empty stomach that I don't get a tummy ache like brewed coffee can sometimes induce.<br /><br />It dissolves quickly in hot water, is lightweight so it travels well (great for backpacking/camping) and both are very versatile to have around for cooking:<br /><br />-- Put a tsp. in a batch of brownies to deepen the dark chocolate flavor<br />-- Add a Tbs in a BIG batch of chili to compliment the spices and add extra richness<br />-- Sprinkle a bit to Mexican mole sauce for punch<br />-- I also put it in: chocolate icing, truffles, chai tea with milk for a java chai latte, coffee drink mixes for extra umph, etc.<br /><br />Both brands are over [...] bucks at supermarkets, when/if you can even find it, so it is nice to know they are cheaper at Amazon.  The Caffe D'Vita is even less costly with Subscribe & Save at amazon!

review/summary: Nice flavor, excellent for recipes
review/text: Recently purchased several cans of this for inclusion in dessert recipes that called for coffee flavoring, and they turned out very well. Also, one of the folks in our office makes supremely weak coffee, and a spoon of this brings it up to drinking strength quite nicely! Definitely a great way to add coffee flavor to something; far better than regular instant coffees.<br /><br />I've tried several varieties of instant espresso, and none (including this) really make anything like real espresso; I have all the apparatus to make it at home, and this doesn't compare. However, unlike the other instants, this IS reasonably tasty when made to espresso-strength, and I find myself actually drinking it as an "espresso-like" beverage once in a while.

I don't even want to try this in my cake recipe!<br /><br />The worse thing is I cannot return this item and don't know what should I do with the rest. It may be my personal taste, but it is better to just buy one jar at the first time to see whether you like it or not.

review/summary: A very good product if you like strong coffee like I do
review/text: I like to use the instant esspresso in iced coffee.  It's best to mix the Cafe D'Vita in the bottom of the glass with some warm water first since the crystals dont disolve as well in cold water.  Then add your chilled coffe, creamor and flavoring.  A very handy product in our coffee cabinet.

review/summary: Better than refrigerated
review/text: I have been using this product for about 5 years now and find it a great substitute for milk.  However, this is the only one I like anymore.  About a year ago they added some new flavoring? or way of processing the refrigerated type which gives it a somewhat rotten or spoiled taste.  I wrote to them about it but only received a canned response.  Don't know if they really care what their customers think.  Anyway, I continue to buy the quart non-refrigerated type (until opened), as they have not ruined the taste of it as of now (even though it is more expensive than the refrigerated cartons).  If you find the flavor has changed in the refrigerated flavors (even the organic one) write to them and maybe if they get enough complaints, they will take it back to the original taste.  It always amazes me how companies take a perfectly good product and think they have to improve it with the end result being worse.

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: The color of Kirstian Reg&aacute;le Pomegrante-Apple is peach-ish, or coral. The Pomegranate is the stronger smell, overwhelming the apple. The fizz isn't nearly as fizzy as Martinelli's, and the taste is sharp with a strong bite. The Pomegranate gives it a fair amount of acidity without too much of a tang. The bite overwhelms the finish as it fizzles away. The apple can be tasted, but acts more to tone down the pomegranate. It went very well with the lemon chicken we had, which was already pretty acidic. The Chicken was pretty light, yet still strongly acidic, and this Sparkler went well with it. It's sweet, but much dryer than any of the other sparkling juices we've had, and cleanses the palette much like the dealcoholized wines I've had. Less of a soda than other sparkling juices I've tried so far, with smaller bubbles. It's not flat, just finer. This doesn't have a head, while the others generally have a bit of one. This one also has continues tiny bubbles drifting upwards, where the others I've tried so far (Welch's Red and their White sparkling juices, as well as R.W. Knudsen's Sparkling Pear Juice and Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Grape) just have bubbles that are stagnant, attached to the side of the glass (in general.)<br /><br />Did I like it: Yes, both my wife and I enjoyed it quite a bit. 9 out of 10.

review/summary: Solved our dog's food allergy problem...
review/text: I was price checking on Amazon to see if I wanted to add Dog Food to our line-up for Amazon Prime purchases and was so surprised no one has reviewed this that I had to post -- in case there is someone out there in the desperate situation we were in 6 months ago.<br /><br />We have a pure bred retriever with horrible food allergies.  Among them is chicken we have figured out, but also something else (we suspect wheat).  She is 4 years old now and and while much loved, has cost us an absolute fortune in vet bills and throws up if she eats anything other than Royal Canin's Hypoallergenic diet.  She wasn't excited by the taste of the Royal Canin but ate it when she got hungry enough.  And no treats allowed, advised the vet.  How miserable.  We tried many many brands of dog food -- all top of the line, highly reviewed, and very expensive.  We transitioned gradually between foods.  We did all the right things.  Only Royal Canin helped (and it was bland, and expensive and required a ridiculous veterinary prescription). We were contemplating switching her a straight beef diet when we came across this product. We had happened to stop at a feed store out in the country and they swore by this line.  Said it was their top pick for dogs with allergies.  No wheat.  No corn.  And in this flavor the chicken was such a small amount they really didn't think it would hurt.  We bought a bag and have been on it ever since -- we now have a happy and healthy dog.  No more throwing up and the food bill (while not cheap) is much more tolerable.  I haven't been brave enough to try their dog treats but maybe...<br /><br />Oh -- and the price on Amazon for the 15 lb is a wee bit cheaper than retail locations in our area (by maybe $3-4).  Not as incredible a discount as the pricing on some of their other items I guess, but not worse than retail at least.  If you don't have Prime though, that would of course jack your price for shipping.

review/summary: Magnificent Molossus 2
review/text: In addition to Avoderm Lamb and Rice canned dog food, we also feed the dry food of the same formula.  Since our blue brindle Cane Corso is somewhat of a finicky eater, I buy lamb breasts (ribs) at between $1.78-2.08 per pound, bake them for three hours, debone them and then mix about a pound with his dry food.  I also add either rice or sweet potatos to bulk it up.  The lamb grease further seasons the dry food and has helped him maintain a beautiful shiny coat.  Lamb has a bit of a gamey odor so be prepared for somewhat of a stinky kitchen while cooking.<br /><br />See correlary review on Avoderm Lamb and Rice canned dog food.

review/text: The flavors are great! They are exactly as I remember them... however... I also remember them being much softer and if you held an airhead vertical it would bend on it's own. I received the box just yesterday (in shrink wrap) and the candy was hard and could barely bite into them. I'm still in search of an expiration date on the box. With any food you order online you definately take a chance... some good and some bad... I'd rate this as a 3 for same great flavors and packaging but freshness... I gotta take 2 stars away.

review/summary: I LOVE AIRHEADS NOT THIS SELLER
review/text: First off I would like to say that I thought long and hard about buying this. I read other reviews claiming these were "stale" and "not stored well" and I would like to say this is 100% correct. You might not notice it very much, but it is correct. The airheads are not gooey and chewy like they should be. I got several hard lumps of something in many of them. There was no green apple flavor, only mystery, watermelon, blue raspberry, cherry, orange and pink lemonade. The orange and cherry had the most problem with deformation (melted and then hardened into different forms).<br />The flaws with these airheads are subtle and will only apparent to an airhead connoisseur. If you don't mind these very subtle flaws and love airheads, buy this! But if you want fresh delicious airheads buy them elsewhere.

These are wonderful and, now that I think about it, can be used by a wise little entrepreneur if they so chose.

The Airheads are all individually wrapped and in a box that has an opening that you can leave open, like a store display would have it, so you can grab one on the go. The candy is tasty and fresh. The only problem is that I have fallen for the false advertising twice. The item listed its contents as having flavors that did not come in the actual delivered box of candy. Twice I thought I was getting a variety selection that included Strawberry and Apple, but both times there was neither selection included. That said, it is a great item with several great flavors.

I've tried all kinds of syrups and extracts, but this is the only hazelnut flavor that has been as tasty as the CoffeeMate Hazelnut creamer.<br /><br />My only problem is that there's no list of ingredients anywhere on the label...or on the Amazon page...or on the company's website. The main reason I'm trying to get away from CoffeeMate is because of all the artificial ingredients, so without knowing what this stuff is made of, I personally have little reason to continue buying it. And it ain't cheap.<br /><br />If you don't care about artificial ingredients or high prices, I definitely recommend this stuff.

review/summary: Oh so virital flavorings
review/text: We love flavored coffees but the price is just to high so I bought orange flavor, hazelnut flavor, cherry flavor, caramel flavor, and chocolate flavor powers, to make my own and they work very well. we can flavor by the cup or the pot and we are very happy with them.<br /><br />With some experimentation we fond all but the chocolate dissolve in cold. So we can and do use it in ice coffee, and we can now make our own flavored water with out having to pay the overly high price.

review/summary: Tasty AND Healthy!
review/text: The first time I purchased this, I paid twice as much in a health food store.  Initially, the 'Aloha Bay Himalayan Crystal Salt' took getting use to after decades of having processed sea salt.  I was motivated to continue using it because of the beautiful coral color and my new, clear, glass salt grinder!  Once my taste buds adapted, I was sold on this product.  I love that I am getting needed minerals into my diet in such a delicious form.<br /><br />When making popcorn, I prefer to use the already ground, 'Eden French Celtic Hand Harvested Sea Salt' for its unique flavor, but the Himalayan salt will continue to be my usual table salt.<br /><br />As a side note; several years ago I invested in small quantities of about eight different salts with trace minerals, in the search for those I liked best.  The top two of my taste choice, are listed above.  I enjoyed the quest and would encourage you to do the same, if you appreciate high quality.

review/text: You don't need Himalayan salt. They're gouging the price of some salt they mined in Asia to confuse you into buying their product.<br /><br />I'm not satisfied with the ass-backwards way they market salt as a "healthy alternative" to regular salt.<br /><br />Sea salt is just as good as "Himalayan salt" if not better, and it costs about $1.50 for twice the amount as this 18 ounce bag of junk.<br /><br />It's a marketing scheme. Do your research about salt instead of falling for this scam.

review/summary: OK. Clean looking but thin paper.
review/text: I ordered these primarily to wrap wine bottles, which may be an unusual case. (When stacking wine in the basement, I like to wrap the bottles to help protect the labels, block light, and cushion in case of an earthquake.) The size is exactly what I expected for a "lunch" size bag.<br /><br />The bags are a nice bright white. However, they are fairly thin - not like brown paper bags in thickness, and substantially thinner and lighter than copier paper. They are partially translucent. This would be a good thing if you wanted to use them for luminaria or something like that.<br /><br />For lunches, they should be OK as long as there is nothing really dense (like a soda can). For my wine bottles they are also OK except of little use for blind tasting; you can read most wine labels through the bag.<br /><br />Overall I'm satisfied but would like something thicker. So I'm giving 3 stars for a decent product but nothing exciting.

review/text: Willy Wonka's Everlasting Gobstoppers are a box of small jawbreakers you suck on. These really do keep changing colors while you eat them just like in the movie, and they do last a very long time. The only minor drawback is that they are not the same strange shape as the one in the movie, but the common round shape instead. They do not have gum inside like a gumball, but are candy all the way, good fruity flavor too.

I became addicted to these great treats last Halloween at my physical therapists office where they were a part of an assortment bag and have not been able to find them in the store.  The candy/gum combination got me through lots of pain.  I have truly not enjoyed any other gumball since I tried the Nerds gumballs, and I wish they would distribute them widely in my area.  Beware, if you try them, you may become addicted too.

review/text: I have been searching for a hair product since Keratase discontinued their moisture creme (nutri sculpt).  I've spent time and money with no success until I tried this TRESemme Hydration Lotion.  It's perfect for my natural curly hair.  Everyone has different needs to style their curly hair, so I have discovered that it is difficult to use other reviews to use on my hair.  This is NOT sticky!  It does a nice job of moisturizing my hair.  I add Gene Juarez Curl Creme to my ends for the small amount of stickiness that I need.  Perfect!  What's better?  I get a six-pack of this product for the price I used to pay for one 6-ounce Keratase Nutri Sculpt.

It gives my hair control, keeps it from being fly away and I can even use it on dry hair.  I have had to order it online now because I can't find it in the stores but it is totally worth it.  I only need about 3 pumps after a shower and I have hair just past my shoulder.  It is really a terrific product that does not weigh my hair down but gives it control and keeps it from being so fly away.

review/text: My hair use to look like Larry's from the 3 stooges! Seriously!  I used Infusium 23 but it left it way too dry and it seemed that my hair would fall out easily?, I also tried the Olive oil root stimulator cream and at first it was awesome but at the end of the day, again my hair was really dry :( Then I found out that it is flammable! So I said, "Forget it."  Then I came on to amazon and read all your reviews about this product and i bought it. I must say that my curls feel amazingly soft and bouncy :)  The only reason I didn't "love it" was because i had some trouble detangleling my hair while wet. I don't know if I used too much product? I wished it would have smoothed out my hair so that I could comb through it easily. I've only used it once, so I guess I have to wait and see. I'll let you gals know. Oh, I also bought the shampoo and conditioner.

review/text: Great coffee.  Not bitter at all.  Love the flavor.  Now I like the more robust french coffee, but, for a decaf coffee, this is pretty darn good stuff.  Smooth, mellow and and no hateful after taste.  Doesnt taste like decaf either.  If you want it a little stronger make a smaller cup size. I was pleasantly surprised how smooth and perfectly blended it tasted.  Go easy on the cream and sugar.  i drink it black, but if you go easy on the cream and sugar, like my wife, she enjoyed it also.  So, sit back in the evening and enjoy a great cup of joe without the caffiene or the bitter flavor.

review/summary: Green Mountain Decaf Coffee
review/text: Didn't like the taste of this coffee at all, would not purchase it again. Have had much better decaf coffee. I think the price was high for the coffee since the taste was so bad, Green Mountain should try to improve their decaf coffee's taste because right now it stinks!!!!!

review/summary: Not at all memorable
review/text: This is an adequate decaf K-cup. While it lacks any significant defects, it also lacks much body or richness. The main downside is a slight sour aftertaste.  I'll certainly drink what I have, but won't be ordering it again. Better decaf K-cups can be found, such as Donut House or Timothy's Columbian decaf.

review/summary: Good selection of vanilla flavored coffee k-cups
review/text: We just bought a Keurig coffee maker from Costco.  It came with 60 k-cups.  Luckily for my husband 55 of the k-cups were regular coffee, like French Roast, so he is happy.  I've been buying a few variety packs of flavored coffee for me so I can find a few flavors that I like.  Included in this Sampler were the following items:<br /><br />2 Gloria Jeans French Vanilla Supreme<br />2 Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla Cream<br />2 Green Mountain French Vanilla<br />2 Folgers Gourmet Vanilla Biscotti<br />2 Wolfgang Puck Vanilla Francaise<br />2 Wolfgang Puck Creme Caramel<br />2 Van Houtte French Vanilla<br />2 Van Houtte Creme Brulee<br /><br />I haven't tried any of the k-cups yet but I am confident that I will find one vanilla flavored coffee that I love.

review/summary: The highest entity that exists on the earth
review/text: I feel unworthy to even be reviewing this item, as it is so far beyond my comprehension, but I will do my best.<br /><br />Chester's Hot Fries are the most sacredly intensely brilliantly delicious thing that has ever been on this earth.<br /><br />I really don't understand why people invest in bonds and stocks, when Hot Fries are so obviously a better investment. They are, firstly,  incredibly cheap; A fair-sized bag fetches $.99, yet their yields are far more abundant than $.99 and they have instant maturity! They are like the Steinway and Sons of the chips world; They are undebatably the greatest product in their field. As such, no price, I mean no price would be high enough to encompass the brilliant ecstasy that these heavenly beings have to offer.<br /><br />I am at a lost to explain drug addiction, when the highest high you can get is clearly to be gotten from these incredible snacks. Not only that but these are cheaper too.<br /><br />I would give a million dollars for these chips. I would give my car, my house, my home, and my life, to maintain the existence of this monument of divinity.
