review/summary: Great quality popcorn
review/text: Tiny But Mighty Popcorn or "TBM" is the best popcorn I have ever had. Being adventurous I've tried all sorts of Popcorn, kettle-corn, cheddar, butter, sugar, even marshmallow popcorn.  So with my "experience" in the popcorn world I can truthfully say I will always come back to TBM Popcorn.  It's the most healthy popcorn out there on the market and it even taste better then every single microwave variety out there.  I have been eating TBM Popcorn for years, recently they have totally redesigned the bag the tiny popcorn comes in.. WOW!!! It looks classy, elegant, sophisticated AND it even gives you guide lines on how to prepare the product to its best results when popping -Not to mention a little history on the ancient heirloom popcorn.. Well done TBM Popcorn Well done! As an avid popcorn lover I cannot wait to see what your next big move is! Keep up the good work Farmer Gene!

review/summary: Love Tiny But Mighty
review/text: I recently moved out west, and was devastated to find Tiny But Mighty unavailable in stores. Three whole days on 'the big stuff' organic yellow popcorn, and my tiny body felt bloated  and backed up, my teeth and head ached from all the hard fluff on the larger corn. Thank goodness 10 pounds of Tiny But Mighty Heirloom Popcorn came in the today. It is my favorite food, perfect for a late night snack without hurting your body.<br /><br /> My posture and attitude are ranked among fantastic, now that I am reunited with this amazing product. Thank you Tiny But Mighty Heirloom Popcorn, I'll never eat big popcorn again!

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I ordered a small bag of this to try out as we like popcorn occasionally.  Received it and followed the directions to pop it stovetop.  Lots of kernels left unpopped, but not an overly unacceptable amount.  Sprinkled some salt on it, and tried it.<br /><br />Not only ARE there hulls left on the popcorn, the popped amount is so small that all you can taste are the hulls!  Other reviews stated that this tasted sweeter than normal popcorn, and we have to disagree.  It tasted plain, and the hulls really bothered me.  Harder than normal popped corn, it was very disappointing.<br /><br />I'm very glad that I only ordered a small bag of this, as it will probably get thrown out.  Unacceptable to us and a waste of money.  Everyone's taste may vary, but we'll take normal-sized popcorn for our snacking needs.

review/summary: Fastachi Belgian Marzipan
review/text: Although this product arrived quickly and well-packaged, it was not the best tasting marzipan that I have ever had.  To be fair, however, it was not the worst I've had either.  My main complaint is that there was little almond flavor to the pieces, which is, of course, the reason you buy marzipan!  But if you want marzipan at a very reasonable price and are not too picky about the taste, this product will suffice.

review/summary: My favorite of all the Cravings Place mixes
review/text: I am a Cravings Place fan, and this is my favorite of all their mixes.  I have allergies/severe intolerances to wheat, dairy, eggs, and nuts.  It is hard to find tasty baked goods with a decent texture, but the Cravings Place mixes are the best at achieving both.<br /><br />I love this mix so much, that I had my mom make it for my wedding cake!  She used homemade, thick apple butter between the layers, and a maple frosting.  It was to die for!!!  Nobody could tell it was not "normal" cake, and nobody cared!  Like most GF cakes, this does not hold up so well to layering - but my mom is a kitchen goddess and figured it out.<br /><br />I make this mix frequently.  I love the cookies and cake equally.  I can't keep my husband out of it, either!<br /><br />Very fast and easy to make.  Serve a warm bar cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice/soy/rice cream for an excellent treat!

review/summary: Kind of pointless, and creme layers are single, not double.
review/text: When I first heard about these cookies, I imagined they would be essentially be a sextuple-stuffed oreo.  Excessive, but why not?  They I saw the photo with the three cookie layers and two creme layers, so I revised a little and expected a quadruple-stuffed cookie, with a chocolate layer and a vanilla layer.<br /><br />But no.  This is three cookie layers, and two single creme layers.<br /><br />Is it an okay tasting cookie?  Sure.  Would I buy it again?  No.  Regular or double-stuffed Oreo's are both superior.<br /><br />Nabisco, you have missed an opportunity here.  People want more and thicker creme layers!  This cookie is far too healthy compared with what I want.<br /><br />Clog my arteries or give me death!

review/summary: The Long-Awaited Aw.
review/text: I'll give it three stars, because it's still an Oreo, and Oreos are awesome.<br /><br />I've been waiting for these.  It seemed to me like something that you would make a YouTube video about.  A thick layer of classic creme, a thick layer of chocolate and three cookies?  Sure!<br /><br />Aw.  And not the roly-poly-kitten awww.  Just aw. It's three cookies, with a single layer of either flavor filling.  The chocolate it nice, but I prefer the classic.  Although the logo imprint on the chocolate creme was kinda cool.<br /><br />The serving size on these bad boys is one cookie.  The classic cookie has a serving size of two cookies.  The Triple Double has 100 calories per cookie, while the classic has 80 (per cookie, 160 calories per serving).  There are about 18 cookies in a 13.1 oz package.<br /><br />So, they aren't bad, but Nabisco had me revved up for something exceptional.  Don't tease me like that.

I can buy the cookies for far less at my local grocery store.  I'm making sure everyone I know sticks with their local store and not your overpriced company.  One shopper I know said if Amazon is that expensive for cookies I can get so much less expensively, then I won't even use them for other items.

review/summary: Dog loves them, but I hate the smell
review/text: I have a 70 pound lab mix, and he goes nuts for these treats. He'll devour one in less than 5 minutes, but it's awesome to see him so happy. However, they have a super strong odor, and I do not find them to be as appealing as he does. Recommended for dog's happiness, just hold your nose if you're sensitive to strong, funky, meat-like smells.

review/summary: Good, but try the Extra Fresh flavor
review/text: My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.

review/text: I have a VERY picky 9.5 yr old German Shepherd that leaves anything but a milkbone on the floor to collect dust.  She LOVED this bone!!!  I was amazed to see her crunch it up the large bone so quickly!  She's always been very well disciplined until these bones arrived at least.  She went into my pantry and tore the bag open and ate 7 bones!!!  She had such a low hung head when I approached her about the issue all I could do was laugh!!!  Luckily, my 4 month old shephard got one before her sister ate the batch!)  I save about $5 ordering the bones on Amazon.

review/summary: Ithing and chewing on paws
review/text: I first purchased a pack of Nutri Dent puppy chews for my Welsh Terrier when he was just a few months old. He LOVED them and they kept him busy for a while. Around the same time, he started itching and chewing on his paws incessantly and would not stop, even for a treat. Initially we thought it was the flee protection, then the shampoo, then the treats, then the peanut butter and lastly these. We continually phased each of the previous items out of his diet/lifestyle until finally we determined that the itching and scratching was related to these. We've obviously stopped giving these to him and now he rarely scratches or chews on himself. Your dog may have a different reaction to them but if he's experienceing any of the above symptoms, it may be related to these.

review/text: A friend of mine gave me quite a few jars of this brand baby food leftover from her baby.  I tried the beef first and upon opening it thought it smelled like cat food.  I guess the cat thought so too because she came running.  I tried to feed it to my baby and she spit it out with a dramatic gagging fit.  I gave the food to the cat and she licked the plate clean.

review/text: Actually I am "Horse Lovers" husband.  I picked up a jar of these about a month ago.  I like jalapenos pretty well with my TexMex, but these are really different.  They have a bit of bite to them but at the same time have a sweet taste as well and are crunchy.  They are great on burgers and anything else you would normally have peppers with, good with cream cheese, and here is the weird one - something possessed me one morning to put some on toast with honey.  Very good but I had to keep it hidden from my wife who would be appalled!!  Anyway, the only problem is they are hard to find (that is why I am on the site right now..).  But I gotta find some more -

I kind-of had to since I lived in New Mexico for 4 years and they put jalapenos in everything from eggs to spaghetti.<br /><br />Texas Pepperwork products are all very good -- These peppers included.  I also like their salsas (except the white one).

review/text: I bought this locally when I couldn't find Monin's syrup.  I like Torani's caramel, chocolate, and nut flavored products in coffee. The pomegranate flavor, though, tastes like cough syrup but not as good.  Monin's the one you want. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H85GNQ">Monin Pomegranate Syrup</a>

It is so fast and easy to use my left over's in it to make a great bread.  In the summer I use zucchini, or make strawberry bread, or Orange Bread, Banana bread, blueberry bread, Raspberry, Applesauce etc.  Whatever I have on hand at the time I want to make bread.<br /><br />Chris

review/summary: 7 months past "best used by" date
review/text: This product tasted off, like it had melted and then resolidified, and also stale. On investigating, I found that the best used date was last year. I have followed the procedure to notify them that I wanted to return it. I needed to email them to get a Return number. The website stated that postage would not be reimbursed. I think that was around $16.<br /><br />I emailed on Wed.  Got a response Sat saying she was just leaving the office but would send me my return number on Tuesday. She said my money would be refunded after they received the merchandise back. Today is Friday, and guess what? I have heard NOTHING from them.<br /><br />If it were possible to rate this no stars, I would. For them to knowingly sell expired food products and not stand by them is atrocious, especially in today's economy. They will never have my business again.

review/summary: Melted yet still taste good once separated
review/text: This company shipped quickly and packaged item well.  Unfortunately, all of the boxes opened so far, 9 out of 12 have had 1/3 to 1/2 of the chocolates melted in it.  Perhaps this happened because of the package sitting in the delivery truck until it got to me.  I am not sure how it happened, yet it is dissapointing which is why I give them an overall score of 3. When melted, the chocolates are sticky and at times difficult to separate in order to eat.  In our case, the mint melted out the top of the chocolate squares and connected all the melted mints together. We love them so much that we ate them this way even though it isn't as enjoyable as when they are unmelted.  Unlike in previous reviews, our chocolates were within the use by date by a few months and taste just fine.

review/summary: Perfect fit
review/text: These are the PERFECT solution for re-using K-cups. They snap very tightly and handle the Keurig's brewing pressure.  I may even be able to reuse these lids a few times.<br /><br />Each K-cup has a filter inside that does not get punctured by any of the needles.  If you tear off the foil top, clean off the filter by rinsing and lightly brushing with a tooth-brush and the letting them dry (if you want), then you can refill them with your own coffee and snap one of these lids on.  It works perfectly.  I can even store them in my carousel - no leaks, no spilled grounds, no problems at all.<br /><br />It took me 30 minutes to prepare and clean 100 K-cups, 2 days for them to thoroughly dry and about 10 minutes to refill them by dumping the coffee in a stock pot and scooping the K-cups through, then snapping on a lid.  No fuss, no muss, no mess.<br /><br />These things are AWESOME!

review/summary: DisposaKup Lids
review/text: The beauty of the Keurig machine is that you can make a single cup of fresh coffee in seconds with no waste.  The drawback is the cost of the K-cups.  However, I have found that the K-cups are reusable many times if you don't mind tearing off their aluminum lids after the first use, and rinsing out the coffee after each use thereafter.  The DisposaKup lids are also reusable many times.  After allowing the K-cups to dry out, if you don't mind periodically taking a few minutes to fill the K-cups with coffee, 50 or so at a time, you can effectively reduce your cost per cup, after your initial investment, to the cost of the coffee. I have found that you need to use a slightly stronger blend as the K-cups will hold slightly less coffee with the DisposaKup lids. I am very satisfied with this product and would give it 5 Stars but for the high cost of the lids, which I would think cost next to nothing to make.

review/summary: Great product, with a little effort. Here is the 1 . 2 . 3 . .
review/text: This product will save you a lot of MONEY! I love my Kurig machine but I don't love the cost of the K-cups. I saw these lids online and immediately started saving, and cleaning out, my used K-cups. Tear off the foil top, dump out the grounds, rinse out the cup and leave them to dry. The lids were a bit of a challenge at first, but I stepped back and thought about it. The lids seemed to be to big for the old cup, but they need to be very tight to withstand the injected water pressure. Solution: 1)Put some lids in a cup of VERY hot water for a few minutes to make them pliable. Remove them as you sue them. 2)Take an EMPTY cup and carefully press the lid on. Hold the cup by the top edge, thumbs under the edge, and GENTLY press the hot lid on like it's very tight Tupperware. DO NOT press on the body of the cup because they crush easily. You may mess up a couple but you will get the hang of it. 3)Let the cup sit for a while, empty. 4)Pop off the lid, I use the edge of a spoon to help with this as it is very tight. 5)Fill the cup with your choice of coffee. Remember, the coffee you took out was used and puffed up, don't over fill or you will waste coffee. 6)Snap the top on, gently, it will be a "snap" now. 7)Pop it in your brewer, turn the cup until it drops in the original hole in the bottom, close the top and enjoy your lower cost, personal choice, coffee! I have re-used the lids, and refilled the same cups, six times and counting. It will take a while to run through 100 lids, but I will re-order when I need them again.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NM9YW6">DisposaKup Lids - 100 Disposable Replacement Lids for Use with Any Keurig K-cup - BOX of 100 LIDS</a>
