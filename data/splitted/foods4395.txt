review/summary: Feed your darkness
review/text: There's a Keurig machine at my new job, and they have a couple varieties of K cups that I haven't seen in local stores or wholesale clubs. My favorite, easily, of these is "Double Black Diamond", the darkest, boldest coffee offered by Green Mountain. So I checked for prices on-line. I was psyched to find this box of 50 for a reasonable 57 cents each or so delivered to my doorstep. I ordered on Wednesday, and the coffee showed up Saturday morning in time for brunch. Hooray to Green Mountain and Amazon. We'll be ordering more soon.

review/summary: Kick in the @#@$%
review/text: Ive tried many KCups. I bought a Green Mountain Bold Variety pack and it had a few of these gems in it. This is some good, strong coffee. Might be overpowering for some people.<br />I recommend this to anyone who has been searching for a kcup that taste like REAL coffee. some of these kcups are so weak. i say giver it a shot or at least try the bold variety pack. their espresso blend s also very strong and Kenya-AA (all part of variety pack) but i liked this one over all.

review/summary: Almost too strong!
review/text: My biggest gripe with the Keurig pods is that the coffee is too weak so I always try the bold varieties.  I think I met my match with this one though. Its almost too strong for me.  I take my coffee black and this one has just a hint of bitterness. I have to use the tallest coffee cup setting when I use this pod.  Dont get me wrong...its a good cup of joe but for my taste I think I like the Emerill bold pods a tad better.<br /><br />On the plus side you can often reuse this pod for a second cup as its strong enough to still make a good cup second time around.

review/summary: Did you feel that coffee lover?  That was the freaking Quickening!
review/text: We're comfortable being honest are we not?  Cool, so I have a coffee problem, I'm OK admitting that to you.  And with that affliction comes the experience of having consumed a crap-load of coffee from all over, K-cups and otherwise.  In the end, Highlander-esque, there can be only one, and the Double Black Diamond is that coffee.  This is the untouchable, best Keurig coffee that I have ever encountered and I am relatively sure that once or twice while drinking it I experienced the mythical Quickening.<br /><br />Buy it, don't buy it, I don't care, just get out of my way so I can keep drinking it.  I just want to die with the taste of it on my lips.

review/text: This coffee is excellent if you like strong coffee.  I have tried Black Tiger, Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, and most of the other XB coffees, but this is the first one that is strong enough for me in an 8 Oz cup.  For reference to Tassimo owners, this is very similar in strenght to the Starbucks Caff&egrave; Verona t-discs.<br /><br />I would NOT purchase from this any of the sellers selling it for twice as much as the other sellers though.  DO note that this product package cost you about $1/cup as you only get 1 box (of 24 cups) vs 2 boxes.  Otherwise, enjoy!

review/text: I've had my Kuerig for about 6 months now.  The hardest thing to do is find good, bold, strong coffee that can be used to make a 10oz mug of coffee.  Too many (most) K-Cups produce a watery-horrible 10oz mug but this cup stands up.  A mug of this coffee is still rich and bold.  I still lhave a hard time with how much K-Cups cost but when on sale this is a worthwhile coffee.

review/text: I found this blend to be among the strongest and best K-cups I have ever tried. It is strong enough for me to brew a regular cup and then use the same Kcup again at the small cup setting to fill up my travel cup.  Never bitter, but very dark, rich and satisfying. I like to mix this with other k-cups such as Jet fuel, Italian roast, etc. If you like strong, non-bitter, dark rich coffee - try this.

review/summary: Awesome brew, strong, bold!
review/text: Every time I get a new Keurig k-cup to try, it just gets better and better most of the time.  This one is no exception.  Green Mountain Double Black Diamond is AWESOMELY bold, and makes a great 6oz. cup. (And it is strong, so you may like an 8oz. brew on this one!) You can tell by shaking the k-cups that these bolder flavors are ground more finely, almost like an espresso.  This really is the best k-cup coffee I've tried so far, just edging out "Dark Magic" because of it's arabica origin.

review/text: Nice strong coffee - smooth but does have a bit of acidic taste at the end. My favorite is Coffee People's Donut Shop, and the Double Black Diamond is a bit stronger with a kick at the end. I've tried three cups so far. Of course it's all preference, but I think this is great. I would buy again. Strong but not too strong. Of course I do drink it slowly...this is not one to gulp down! Don't let the reviews scare you - if you're looking for a new bold coffee try the Green Mountain bold sampler pack - good choices in there, including this one!

review/text: This is definitely one of my favorites it has a fresh and great coffee taste, it's delicious. This will definitely be a must buy for those that like strong (almost espresso) coffee. If you need some energy and a nice strong kick in the morning this is definitely the coffee for you. I know I do, I live in NYC and have an awful commute in the morning. So, I need lots of caffeine to get through my commute and the rest of the day. I wasn't really getting that from some of my other coffee choices of the k-cups. I just got my machine and I am experimenting with all the extra and extra-extra bold coffees and so far between this one and the Timothy's Parisian Nights. So, so good I love them!! This is very addicting, strong coffee!!! ;o)

review/summary: Strong Bold Taste
review/text: I like strong coffee and this fits the bill. My favorite is Barista's Italian Roast with Starbucks Verona close behind. Green Mountain Double Black Diamond is almost as good as those 2 but less expensive. I will buy this again.<br /><br />To save money, we have been making our own Kcups by reusing the brand cups -- after use, peel the foil top off, try to get all off the edge (but not necessary). Rinse out the used coffee. There is a filter built into the cups. We bought some Kcup lids on Amazon - 100 for about $15. Fill the rinsed out cup with your own favorite coffee, snap on the replacement lid and you are good to go. When placing in cup holder, make sure the little hole on the bottom from first use puncture is at the top and fits back onto the bottom pin - that way you do not get 2 holes in bottom of Kcup. You can resuse the Kcup many times befor it wears out.<br /><br />In the morning I will start off with GM Double Black and then for 2nd or 3rd cup use one we filled. Someday's I splurge and start with Barista Italian Roast.<br /><br />If you like strong, bold coffee, try the Black Magic. It is smooth without much of a bitter after taste. Although, I kind of like that after taste. It is too bold for my wife, so I tell her to reuse the Kcup I just used and make an 8oz cup... makes a good cup of coffee, just not quite as strong... and we get 2 cups out of the one Kcup.

review/summary: Nice replacement for Green Mountain Coffee's Espresso Blend
review/text: Upon trying to replenish my supply of Green Mountain Coffee's Espresso Blend, I found they had discontinued it.  I hesitated to buy Timothy's Espresso Blend (now the only espresso k-cup on the market) due to the reviews but have since tried GMC's Dark Magic and now GMC's Double Black Diamond.  Double Black Diamond doesn't have the flavors the Espresso Blend has but it has a very good flavor on its own.  It has no bitter aftertaste as you would expect with such a strong, extra bold coffee.  Where the Dark Magic was too weak for my daily latte, the Double Black Diamond makes for a very fine latte.  This is my pick as a substitute for GMC's Espresso Blend.<br /><br />Update: I've been drinking this coffee for a few weeks now and have to say, it is great.  It is my new favorite!  Also, bought a couple of Extra Bold Roast k-cup coffee sample packs via Keurig and haven't found any better than GMC Double Black Diamond.

review/text: I grew up drinking coffee in New Orleans.  I have been soooo disappointed with all of the K-cup coffees because they are so mild. After reading reviews, I decided to try all the ones that were said to be good, strong coffees.  First I tried Jet Fuel.  It is strong, but no taste.  Then I tried Paul Newmans dark roast.  It was so so, but nothing special.<br />I saw the Big Easy k-cup and thought, this must be it.  It is good. Don't get me wrong.  It is my second choice.  But the winner is  Green Mountain Double Black Diamond! It is really, really good.  If you like your coffee strong and bold with great flavor, this is the one.  I don't care what it costs.  It is worth it.

review/text: In my search for the boldest, richest, darkest blend for Keurig, Double Black Diamond wins hands down. When compared to traditional coffees, it is comparable to Cafe Du Monde. I am actually quite surprised it doesn't have chicory in it. It is bold and rich without being at all bitter. Prior to this coffee, I thought Starbuck's Italian roast was the boldest commercial blend. But, Double Black Diamond makes it look weak in comparison. It brews to an almost jet-black and is very dark and earthy without a hint of bitterness or sweetness. It is very much like an espresso and I suspect it may contain as much caffeine. I am very surprised to find a Keurig blend that is comparable to the best French Market coffees and Italian espressos.

review/summary: BOLD
review/text: I found that this coffee was much more BOLDER than the JET FUEL that I had before. If I would have known it was that much stronger I would not have bought it. It is good, I just make the smaller cup and blend it with another flavor ,such as cinnamon. Other than that I like it. I will not buy it again though, it is to bold for my taste buds.

review/summary: Strong but French...
review/text: Ok here is the short version, I love a strong cup of coffee but I dont like french roast. So this coffee is strong and has almost no bitter after tase but it does have a french roast taste to it, so if that is what you like try this. Personally I am sticking to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHIZXE">Gloria Jean's Coffees, Black Gold Extra Bold, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.

I don't like french roast or some other types of extra bold if they are gonna have that burnt taste. But this does not. It's just a strong type of coffee. If your like me, you will like it.

review/summary: GM Double Black Diamond - Pretty good.
review/text: One of my concerns with the K-cup brewers is that I wouldn't be able to get a good, strong cup of coffe, which I love.  It has taken a few orders of different varieties to find a strong one that has the right blend of bold, flavor and bitterness.  Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond meets most of that criteria pretty well.  It is a little more on the bitter side than I normally prefer, which I why I only gave 4 stars, but overall a great bold cup of coffee.  I would order this variety again.

review/text: I have tried many of the available coffee's available but, I enjoy a robust coffee in the morning and both Black Magic and Black Diamond Extra Bold meet and exceed what I was expecting.  The Nantucket Blend is a great coffee for anytime of day or night.  I usually wait until Amazon has a sale on these to make my purchase...Make sure when you buy k cups that the Amazon Prime logo appears...Without the Amazon Prime Logo, I have found what I received in the past did not reflect what I had ordered.. Substitution get made without your knowledge and sometimes count is short, etc...

review/text: Bought a Keurig for times when a single cup of coffee is all that is needed.  What I had not anticipated was that my husband was underwhelmed with the assortment of coffees that came with the brewer... until I found the Double Black Diamond Extra Bold. Now my Keurig is being used for afternoon coffee breaks and I don't feel like my "investment" is headed to a yard sale/thrift shop anytime soon.  If you are a lover of stronger, premium coffee, this may be exactly what you are looking for when a pot of coffee is simply too much for one.

review/summary: Very Dark and Bold
review/text: This is one of my favorite K-Cups, and over the last several months I've sampled pretty much all the "extra bold" ones I can find. This one is very dark and strong without being too bitter (although I don't mind a little bit of bitterness in mine). They are similar to the Green Mountain "Dark Magic" variety, but I find that they are stronger, and perhaps a little more bitter. For reference, my favorite K-Cup is the Starbucks French Roast variety, but I also really like this kind, Green Mountain Dark Magic, and Emeril's Big Easy Bold.

review/text: My husband hasn't been able to find a K-cup bold enough for his taste.  I bought the Double Black Diamond after comparing reviews for the various brands and blends.  We have not been disappointed.<br /><br />This has a french roast taste, which is a favorite of his but not usually a favorite of mine. The coffee is not bitter nor does the coffee taste burnt.  Pretty decent on days where I want something with more of a punch.<br /><br />I am glad this is the brand/blend that I chose.  I probably won't be experimenting with the K-cup bold blends. This one works for us.

Double Black Diamond is getting there, but it's still a touch weaker than I prefer.  Green Mountain's Dark Magic, or Sumatra Reserve, go a little darker and deeper and are, in my estimation, the five-star K-cups.  This one's close, but still not on the target.

review/text: I've tried lots of different coffees in my Kuerig brewer located in my office.  I like strong coffee, but it also has to be smooth.  Some of the stronger coffees tend to be bitter, but at least for me the double black diamond is smooth and tasteful.  While I drink some other flavors just for variety, this is by far my favorite for that first cup in the morning.

review/text: My original review was 1 star because I believe that I got a bad batch. I kept trying it and finally it started tasting good. It is the strongest K Kup on the market. With every other bold-strong coffee that I used to buy, I needed to use the 4oz setting on my Keurig or else it would be too weak. With this brand I can use the middle setting  (8oz) and it is still strong enough for me. Actually this saves money. Be warned, if you do not like strong coffee you will need to use the highest level on your Keurig or you will think it is too strong. If you want the strongest, this is the one you need to get.

Portion control is also easier with the small can size.<br /><br />I've ordered a few packs of these almonds, and while there is some slight variation in the taste from batch to batch (some are roasted a bit darker than others), I have always found them fresh and tasty.<br /><br />Almonds are relatively healthy too - high in protein, a good source of magnesium, calcium, and manganese, and full of unsaturated fats.<br /><br />I haven't seen organic roasted, salted almonds from this company, but I hope they offer them eventually at a decent price.  One thing I would also like to see is some kind of assurance that the can liner is free of BPA.

review/summary: Perfect little guys
review/text: Yup, no stray pieces, just whole brown almonds. Which is to say that these are not "blanched" - blanching being the process that removes the actual skin of the almond (not the husk) and leaves a pale buff-colored product. And the description of "lightly salted" is accurate. I can barely taste it. The can says the ingredients are almonds, vegetable oil (canola, safflower and/or sunflower) and salt. That's it. Gluten-free. Interestingly enough, there is no indication on either the can or their website whether these are raw or roasted. And I couldn't tell by eating them. But Blue Diamond responded to my email query, saying they are in fact oil roasted - have to be "Pasteurized", per a new California law. [You might want to know that this is a "light" roasting. I would say that it goes part way to a roasted flavor, remaining as healthy as possible while conforming to the legislation I mentioned. My taste preference is actually for the flavor of a fully roasted almond, bad me.]<br /><br />They taste fresh and almondy, as they should. They make a wonderful addition in both taste and appearance, to my just-created Nonpareil Trail Mix which is lo-carb and gluten-free as I am trying even harder to follow this kind of diet. I'm pleased to report that these Blue Diamond Almonds are properly dated: on the bottom of the can it says "BEST BEFORE JUL 20 14". That gives plenty of time to use up six little cans.<br /><br />And about the cans, they seem to be metal bottom and sides, making them superior for storage although the plastic replaceable top with sealed metallic foil under it might be breachable by the ubiquitous rodent. The little cans are nicely reusable.

review/summary: One of my very favorite flavors!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack. This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 2% of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is the perfect one for you. This is as good as it gets in snack foods and good for your body and diet.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.

review/text: If you like snacks that are a healthier alternative to other options, almonds are a great way to go.  These almonds are lightly salted and roasted.  They are absolutely delicious.  I could easily see getting in trouble with these since I could sit down and eat the whole can in a sitting and not even realize it.  I snack on them pretty much every morning to tide me over until lunch without having to eat a big meal or something very unhealthy for me.

I believe this is Blue Diamond's best selling variety of Almonds. These come in 1.5 ounce packages and for me each package is good for 2-3 servings - about a handful each serving. Very tasty

It's the same price (about $3 a can) at the local Target.  Plus, and this is a personal problem, I had a hard time being conservative with em.  They are delicious (not as good as the smoked ones though which Amazon doesn't sell for some reason) and I couldn't stop eating them!  I went through two cans in the first night!  I love to snack, but almonds aren't the best for snacking in large quantities, and I won't explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system.  Anyways, the nuts are perfectly fine and it's a decent price (considering you're not paying sales tax outside of NY and that there's free shipping if you're patient) so I can't not recommend them, although I will never buy em again in this quantity.

review/text: DESCRIPTION:<br />> Blue Diamond Roasted-Salted Almonds are moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil (but not oily or greasy), and lightly salted.  These are "heart healthy" oils which are actually good for you, as is the almond oil itself.  Roasted Salted Almonds are available in bags or small cans small.<br />> Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds are similar with wonderful smokey flavor.  At this time Smokehouse Almonds are available from Amazon only in 16 oz (and smaller) bags.<br />> I have not tried the "lightly salted" variety but I presume that they have almost no salt.<br /><br />CANS vs BAGS<br />Various types of Blue Diamond Almonds are available in bags or small cans.  The small cans (3 1/4" in diameter by 2 3/8" high) are very convenient and assure that the almonds stay fresh until openned, and afterward, because they don't stay "openned" long (it is easy to eat a whole can at one setting).  Arguably the bags more environmentally friendly, but you don't get much of a price break for the much cheaper packaging.  I prefer the convenience and freshness of the cans.<br /><br />EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful.  Well roasted and crunchy.  I cannot decide which I like best: the Roasted Salted or the Smokehouse.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  I happen to like the roasted-in-oil flavor.<br /><br />LESS ROASTED ALMONDS<br />If you prefer less-roasted almonds, roasted without added oil, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COJ85G">Back To Nature California Almonds, Sea Salt Roasted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />UNROASTED ALMONDS<br />Unroasted almonds are available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COE1AI">Back To Nature California Almonds, Unroasted & Unsalted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> but beware that thorough roasting makes almonds more digestable.  Unroasted almonds are susceptable to fungus which can be carcinogenic.  While commercial domestic almonds sold in the US do not contain significant levels of cyanide, bitter almonds, (which have a much richer almond flavor, particular in baked goods).  Indeed natural almond extract is made from bitter almonds---artificial almond extract is safer.  Bitter almonds are sometimes illegally sold in the US and are often encountered in other countries, and do contain dangerous levels of cyanide when raw.  7-10 raw bitter almonds can kill a child.  Moreover, a child raised on raw almonds may conclude that raw peach pits (essentially a variety of almonds) are safe to eat---they are NOT.  The safest practice is NOT to eat unroasted almonds.

review/text: I've been dieting for so long I can't remember what high calorie/high fat food tastes like and this has become one of my simple pleasures.  Dump a pack over a little brown rice and it really has what grandpa called "stick to you ribs" qualities.  It has enough spice that I've used it layered over black beans topped with onions & cheese & told friends it was a "Mexican dip" & they LOVED it without ever suspecting it was good for them. (ha-ha).  There are other Tasty Bite dishes that are quite good but in my opinion, this is the best and quite versatile.

review/text: I am a huge fan of Tasty Bite premade food. I am a vegan and these are super simple meals that I can take with me to work. So far this is my favorite. It has a nice flavor, you get alot of eggplant with not too much spice. This is a bit more calories than their other meals and it is more mushy, is the best word to say. They suggest using this as a spread or dip or something to add to another dish. I agree. I used it with rice and snowpeas. If you arent into softer food then don't try this as a main course by itself.<br /> Texture aside the taste is on point. It is not really indian food but it sure is a good cheap subsitute.

review/summary: Tastiest Bite!
review/text: My favorite of the Tasty Bite entrees.<br />The best things about this is: convenience, entirely simple & organic ingredients, tasty flavor and combination of spices, and shelf stable.  Also, it's a little spicy. Yum!<br />Don't set your expectations too high. This is shelf stable, processed food. It's not supposed to be anything close to restaurant quality.  For what it is, it's delicious though.<br />The main and only downside for me is that it is quite high in sodium, and a little oily.<br />Also, don't expect any "chunks".  It's more like a thick eggplant soup, but it's delicious poured over white rice, which is how I eat it. Dipping naan into it is another tasty option.
