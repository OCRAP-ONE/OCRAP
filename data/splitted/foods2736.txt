review/summary: Very nice, soothing, and flavorful Peppermint Tea
review/text: Sit down, put your feet up, and take a break with a nice cup of tea. Chances are, you do not often have the opportunity for this kind of quiet luxury, so the tea better be superb.  And this herbal peppermint is flavorful and delicious.<br /><br />Peppermint tea typically has no caffeine, so you can enjoy this any time of day or night.

review/summary: Good and strong.
review/text: I drink herbal tea in two ways. The first, and honestly less common way, is to pour hot water over the teabag and drink it hot. Sometimes i even take the bag out after a few minutes. The other is to pour cold water over the teabag and let it sit for a few minutes, making basically a weak impromptu iced tea when i don't feel like drinking plain water.<br /><br />This tea was good for both types of drinking, though it might even be a little too strong for the cold-drinking method. You could probably get two to three cups of hot tea from a single bag.<br /><br />The flavor is clean and fresh peppermint, with none of the mustiness that one sometimes finds in mass-produced mint teas. The bags are individually wrapped, and they're the kind with a string attached that you can use to anchor the teabag to the handle of your mug if you choose.

review/summary: Very Smooth - Good Tea
review/text: This is very smooth, good tea. I have a habit of getting busy and letting my tea steep too long. This can make most teas have a bitter aftertaste, but I have noticed that this tea does not get too strong, even when steeped too long. This has a nice, smooth peppermint taste. Peppermint is one of my favorite kinds of tea; I use it for digestion/stomach problems. Personally, I like this tea.

review/summary: My Favorite Brand Of Tea For Many Reasons
review/text: Higgins & Burke has quickly become my favorite tea brand.  Their teabags offer more robust flavor than others; the peppermint is no exception.  How relaxing to sit down with such flavorful brews.<br /><br />Higgins & Burke quality goes beyond good taste.  Whoever designed the box should get a promotion.  Thank you for providing the little diamond cut-out which allows for easy dispensing.  No more fumbling with box tops.  I can also pack a few in my purse for travel as each bag is individually wrapped.<br /><br />The only drawback is item availability--I sure wish I could find Higgins & Burke teas locally.  Thankfully Amazon stocks a wide variety.  That helps but consumers have to buy in bulk, usually six boxes of one specific type tea.  Perhaps the company would consider selling a variety pack or mix & match--six boxes with six different flavors.  That would be a nice way to sample other varieties.

review/summary: Mild, pleasant peppermint tea
review/text: Higgins and Burke's Peppermint Tea is pleasant hot or iced. The flavor is very mild, and even if you leave it to brew well beyond the 3 to 5 minutes recommended on the box, the taste does not change. My one criticism for this tea and for Higgins and Burke's chai tea as well is that it isn't quite strong enough. I've about decided that these are designed to be brewed in a tea cup and rather than an 8 ounce mug. So if you like a mug of tea with an intense flavor, you will need to use two tea bags. For this reason, I give these tea bags four stars, rather than five.

review/text: Even though we steeped the tea in extremely hot water and the color had a nice caramel hue, the flavor of the tea is too weak for my taste.  It's supposed to be peppermint.  It has a hint of mint but that's about it.  I've tried it hot and iced and I wouldn't buy it, even though I will always choose flavored teas in restaurant when I have the opportunity to do so.

review/text: I really enjoyed this wonderful peppermint tea. It is quite mild, even when allowed to steep for several minutes. The peppermint does not totally overpower you. A light touch of menthol is hinted at. I have some nasty little tummy troubles, and find this definitely helps to soothe away the tummy upset and pain. I highly recommend this delightful tea!<br /><br />****DISCLOSURE: This product was provided by Amazon Vine in exchange for an independent and non-biased review.

review/summary: Not the best tea in the market place.
review/text: I love the flavor of peppermint but that barely comes through in these tea bags.  I was sorely disappointed by the bland, almost missing flavor in this tea.  My aunt barely dips her tea bags in the hot water because she like her tea to be really WEAK and half full of cream but I drink mine black without sugar and enjoy a robust flavor.  This tea is not very good and I will give my aunt my remaining bags.  I won't be buying this Higgins and Burke Teas ever again after I tried a second flavor with the same tasteless results.  Unless you are like my aunt, I can not recommend this company's teas.

review/summary: refreshing peppermint, nicely balanced
review/text: I love almost all things peppermint, and we're big tea drinkers in our house. Last winter, I discovered peppermint tea for the first time at a local coffee house, and have seen been trying to find one as good. I bought a Bigelow peppermint medley tea at the grocery store, and it was lackluster to say the least. When I saw the Higgins & Burke Peppermint tea through the Vine program, I jumped at it, even though it's summer!<br /><br />It was finally not 100 degrees out this morning, so I made a cup of tea. I let it steep for several minutes, because it didn't seem to have much flavor. After another few minutes, I took out the tea bag, tasted it again, and decided to add a packet of Splenda. Some herbal teas are flavorful enough that I don't add a sweetener, but I did find this peppermint tea to taste a lot better with it because the flavor is a bit too subtle. It has a refreshing mint taste with a lovely aftertaste. I haven't tried it as an iced tea but based on rave reviews from others, I may do that too.<br /><br />I like that the bags are individually packaged to help keep them fresh longer. That means I can bring some with me when I travel or keep a few in my purse. The box has a built-in dispenser, which is also handy. All in all, it's a lovely tea. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it still isn't as good as the one I got at the coffee shop, but it's still very good.

review/summary: Perfect Amount of Peppermint
review/text: I have a love/hate relationship with peppermint. If it is overly strong (like in Altoids) I don't really like it. This tea was perfect for me. It had a great peppermint taste without numbing my taste buds. Each box contains 20 individually wrapped tea bags. I really appreciate having tea bags individually wrapped as it makes storing them much easier. The peppermint smell was very strong when I unwrapped the tea bag. This indicated that the tea was decently fresh and pure. The only ingredient was peppermint leaves so there wasn't anything to distract from the taste of peppermint. I really loved this as an iced tea. It's very refreshing on a hot summer's day. I highly recommend trying this brand. It's my favorite peppermint tea thus far.

review/summary: A Refreshing Break
review/text: I sometimes like a cup of peppermint tea after dinner or before bedtime - it can aid in digestion and/or relax me to help me to sleep. And sometimes a cup of peppermint tea in the afternoon is a simple refreshing break! The problem I have with most brands is they are regular teas with a peppermint flavoring - not what I really want, especially after a meal or at bedtime.<br /><br />I gave this tea a try, and I had never heard of Higgins & Burke. It is made of 100% peppermint leaves, which are individually bagged. To get the true essence of the tea, it should be steeped the full 3 to 5 minutes - which is true of most herbal teas. It gives a nice, rich color, and the aroma is a delightful, delicate peppermint.<br /><br />The taste is not overwhelmingly peppermint or minty. It has a more delicate taste, which I think I prefer. I've had some peppermint/mint teas which tasted more like a peppermint stick - just a bit strong! This tea is more delicate, more teasing, and I enjoyed it. I do sweeten my teas, so I think that prevented the "bland" taste that some reviewers are speaking of here.<br /><br />I will certainly be on the lookout for this brand name, and will certainly try other teas they produce!

And I was every bit as satisfied with this peppermint tea as I was with the Black Chai.  I think it's perfect for those times when you need a pick-me-up, but don't want any caffeine.  This tea has a stimulating peppermint taste that perks me up quite nicely, but won't keep me awake when it's time to go to sleep.  The ingredients list reads "Premium Peppermint Leaves" and that's it.  So if you like peppermint and want a nice, refreshing cup of herbal tea, you might want to give this a try.

review/text: This tea is really tasty. I've tried myriad brands of peppermint tea and I have to say that this is a real competitor. If you've ever had peppermint tea where the peppermint wasn't evident, you'll appreciate this tea. It has menthol in it and perhaps that's the reason that the flavor is so much more robust but it was really good and it didn't leave you guessing what kind of tea you were drinking when you started out.<br /><br />This may be a one-off but when I sniffed it, it did noticeably clear up my sinuses for several hours afterwards.<br /><br />It's also caffeine-free so it's safe to have before bed. I would definitely purchase it in the future.

review/summary: Makes marvelous mint iced tea
review/text: Peppermint is one of my favorite tea flavors.  I have tried quite a few different mint teas, searching for the brightest, most flavorful options.  The true test for me is whether or not I'll need sweetener to enjoy it.  If it doesn't need sweetener, than it truly is a special flavor!<br /><br />Out of the individual wrapping, the tea bag smells strongly like an Altoid mint - refreshing!  No other ingredients mixed in with the mint leaves goes a long way to ensure a pure peppermint taste.<br /><br />Brewed as hot tea, I found this to have a very nice flavor.  I did not need sweetener!  It was not quite as strong as I would have liked, but it still did not disappoint.<br /><br />I also tried brewing this as iced tea.  I found the flavor to be much stronger when iced!  Mint is so cooling & soothing, it makes complete sense that the taste of it in cold form would have more impact.  This was actually the best mint iced tea I think I've had.<br /><br />As hot tea, this is a runner-up to my favorite mint tea by Tazo.  As iced tea, though, Higgins & Burke was fantastic!  Plus, when you're through the bags are completely compostable, with no staple holding the tea bag to the paper tag - a finish I can feel good about.

I like that it's caffeine free, so I can drink it even at night before bed.<br /><br />I like the sturdy box this tea comes in - it's got a tear-away panel for dispensing the packets.  Some other teas I use have flimsy boxes that either open repeatedly, spilling the bags, or get crushed.  I also like that each individual bag is sealed for freshness.<br /><br />I will look for this tea again, when the box is gone.

review/text: Well, I can't say I'm a tea expert - but I do like iced tea and hot tea once in a while, usually just regular teas, not herbal, not special flavors, etc...the cheapest is fine for me. So, I tried this out of curiosity and simply put, I'm impressed....it is excellent. I tried it in the morning, but I think it would be fine whenever one desired tea. Usually, I add sugar to my tea, but here there was no need - it tastes great, very understated - the peppermint and menthol work well, even with a nice aroma which enhances the drinking experience. So, no calories, natural ingredients and the claim that it is made from premium tea leaves and Oregon peppermint leaves, calling it the world's finest peppermint - as I say, I am no expert, but I am pleased and it does feel nice to think some extra effort was made in making this tea.

review/text: I love dual flavors.  I just love flavors and am always looking for ways to make something I already like more flavorful.<br /><br />That being said, this makes my already strawberry flavored tea have that cool flavor that I really love in the summer and it does stand alone as a light minty tea.  I can't wait to try this later in the year for a quick warm up on a cold morning. Now I have this as a drink with my snack in the evening as it is caffeine free.<br /><br />Higgins and Burke already introduced me to the most flavorful Earl Grey I've ever tasted and they pay attention to the smallest of details like the bag.  I never get any stray tea in my glass, and this bag does have a string and tag on it so that I can trash the box if I so desire and still know what it bag contains.  I even got a second cup out of one bag.<br /><br />Wonderful tea...can't wait to gradually try the other flavors as Higgins and Burke is affordable unlike a lot of the others I see.  Try it...you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Incredibly good for colds!
review/text: I received this box just as I was catching a cold, so this was incredibly good timing. This was just what I needed for a stuffy nose and scratchy throat.<br /><br />The box says to brew for 3-5 minutes, but I only had to brew this for three minutes to get a good strong peppermint taste, so it brews up quickly. (A plus, if you're short on time or just impatient.) It has a nice scent to it and does wonders for my poor tortured nose.<br /><br />The taste is the best part, though. This isn't an overwhelmingly strong peppermint taste (although if desired, I'm sure you could brew it for longer to achieve that) and is a good sipping tea. I was a little afraid that I wouldn't take to a tea that was only peppermint flavored, but this is excellent.<br /><br />This is absolutely delicious and soothing, a must buy for tea lovers.

review/text: The Higgins & Burke peppermint herbal tea is a refreshing minty tasting caffeine-free drink for any time of the day...or night, with no worries about not being able to sleep. I drink it hot or cold; it's easy to make, and I like it both ways. I would buy it again because I like the flavor.  I put two bags in a large mug, btw.  (The pictures on the box show one bag in a small cup.)  The package also says you can use it for a sachet, but there are more fragrant sachets.

review/summary: Excellent Peppermint Tea +++
review/text: This is indeed an excellent peppermint tea. It has a great peppermint aroma even before encountering a strong peppermint flavor. This is a rich invigorating tea that clears ones nose and soothes mouth, throat and belly. Like other Higgins & Burke teas, the pure herbal Oregon peppermint leaves are in bags that are enclosed in individual foil pouches. This tea is great hot or iced -- alone or with other tea -- such as a favorite green or black tea. It could become especially liked as a basis for Summer iced teas -- alone or with green or black +++

review/summary: The Six pack! Perfect for the Home Bar
review/text: I have tried several of Fee Brother's Bitters and I am ordering the rest of them today. The Orange and Peach Bitters are the finest there is. I might be one of the few people that has actually compared different brands of bitters. If you want to have a complete battery of bitters for mixing drinks at home or at a bar, you need:<br /><br />Orange Bitters<br />Peach Bitters<br />Lemon Bitters<br />Old Fashioned (Angostura-type) Bitters<br />Peychaud's Bitters<br />Jaegermeister<br />Campari<br />Unicum<br /><br />I have used Fee's Brothers at my bar for over ten years, and you can't get some of these anywhere else in the world, if you like mixed drinks, you'll need to buy several of these from Fee Brother's, the complete 8 pack is great. The Old Fashioned Bitters you can get lots of places, and Angostura is quite good, but Fee Brothers is every bit as good. Fee Brother's Orange Bitters is far better than Angostura's Orange Bitters, so I think this set is the quintessential set you'll need. Go ahead, try to find peach or cherry bitters from another company. Get some Peychaud's and a few others and you're good to go.<br /><br />The idea of rhubarb bitters seems a little strange to me, but I haven't tried it, to be honest, and rhubarb might be a little overkill, so this six pack might be perfect for lemon, orange, peach and cherry bitters. Grapefruit sounds great, look forward to trying it.

review/summary: Great Producet, but 2 Major Failures -- Fire your log/ops, FeesBros.
review/text: The products are great.  I love mixing drinks, and these bitters give me a bit of an extended arsenal on some otherwise standard and expected recipes.<br /><br />But there are 2 major problems.  The first, and in my opinion more minor, is in packaging/shipping.  At least 2 of the 6 bottles arrived having leaked 1/4 of their contents.  When I received my order I opened my large-ish Amazon box  of office supplies and was greeted with a wall of fruity boozy KABOOM!!!.  This was because the orange and peach bitters leaked all over themselves, their fellow bottles, and into the enclosing box.  No biggie, some lost product, but I can deal.<br /><br />The second and more problematic problem is that the shaker caps don't fit.  I wanted 3 dashes of lemon bitters in my manhattan and received 3 oz.  It's not a loose fit, it's a non-fit.  The cap is way way too loose.  Even if you try to shake it cautiously it jumps right off.  Not just 1 of my bottles, it's done it on the lemons and the grapefruits.  I've only tried 4 of the bottles so far, so that's a 50% catastrophe rate.  2 drinks with fine bases, down the drain, undrinkable.<br /><br />This set is awesome, but HEED THE WARNINGS, sailors.

review/summary: A problem
review/text: I was really excited to get this. When I opened it, there was a note inside. The note stated to be careful when using the lemon bitters as the oils in it might loosen the drop pourer when used. Well, I didn't have to worry about it spilling when I used it, because it had leaked nearly half the bottle while still in the box. I was out of town for an extended time and my boyfriend put the box on our extra bed and it leaked thru the box on to the linens. It's oily and very difficult to remove the stain. I guess I just expected more since this wasn't cheap at nearly 9 bucks a bottle, and to discover almost half a bottle gone is irritating. I hope they get there issue resolved, but I will think twice about ordering from them in the future.

review/text: I wish I had known previously that Fees are glycerine based bitters, and it my fault I did not research this more.  However with the cocktail craze and people buying bitters at break neck pace these days.  One should know that "traditional" bitters are alcohol based extractions and give a much different flavor profile than sugar extracted bitters "glycerine extraction".<br /><br />I will try returning my bitters, which are untouched, as I learned my mistake after ordering.<br /><br />I highly recommend Scrappy's bitters from Seattle.

review/summary: Wonderful. Easy. Tasty. Vegan. Even has a little fork.
review/text: One of the best things about this product is that it does not require refrigeration. It is quite simple to prepare in a microwave and is very enjoyable. It doesn't take long at all. Just make sure not to use too much water or you'll dilute the flavor from the sauce. I don't do an exact measurement. I turn on the faucet and let a bit get on the bottom. It doesn't need a whole lot. This may require some experimentation for each person. This is my favorite boxed meal. * I put the noodles in before the water. Just let the water get around the noodles, not on them. - As for those with peanut allergies, I don't know if there are peanuts somehow in the sauce or anything, but there is a package of peanuts that comes with this that you can use or not. I prefer it without the peanuts.

review/text: These noodles replaced another, excellent brand on our grocery shelves. (Annie Chun, fyi.) Both brands make similar flavors--Kung Pao, Sesame, Peanut, etc.<br /><br />These noodles have a pastiness that is unpleasant and no really good flavor. I like this variety of convenient pre-boiled noodles for a quick lunch at work; they are easy to make up in the microwave and come in a bowl of their own (though I put mine into a ceramic bowl as I don't like eating out of plastic if I can help it.) Sometimes I am too busy to go out for lunch and hot noodles are very pleasant. But these are NOT pleasant. No, indeed.<br /><br />These are dominating our grocery shelves but they don't deserve to be there. Bad taste and texture. Just bad. Don't bother.

review/text: Wow. I was really excited to try these; unfortunately, after struggling through about six bites, I had to throw it away. Immediately out of the microwave, the bowl reeked of melted plastic. At first, I thought I had melted the bowl, but after inspecting it and attempting several bites, I discovered it was the scent of the noodles and broth. The noodles were super fine, which I like; however, I couldn't get past the super slimey feel. They almost seemed like they had a glue-like consistency. I only cooked for two of the recommended 2-3 minutes. I don't know if you get different results with the boil and pour method, but I disliked them so much I'm not willing to give that a try.

However, they are extremely sweet - almost like eating a candy bar. 2 of the first 5 ingredients are some kind of sweetener (syrup or sugar). 13 grams of sugar, only 2 grams of protein, and 130 calories. It may be worth it to some to snack on, but I'd rather have something with less sugar and more nutritional value. My search continues...

review/summary: Great and good price!
review/text: I love these noodles.  They are really great for a midnight snack.  It's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner.  If you do eat it for dinner, you will be hungry later.  Maybe some people wouldn't!!!!  But, it just doesn't stick to my ribs.  I love them though and Amazon has a really good price.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: This soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy! I really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up, nice texture. It is very satisfying to me. I'm a single gal who doesn't really cook & am often in a hurry for my next meal, and I find that this soup really hits the spot. Although it does tend to be more of a mid-afternoon snack/light lunch item for me. It will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours.<br /><br />Personally I LOOOVE this soup that much more because I had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because I developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  It seems that often these instant noodle packets/bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. This one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. Another plus for me is that it's not spicy. I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have GERD/reflux, so believe me if i can eat it is NOT spicy. Just tasty :)<br /><br />One thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable (in my town they only take 1's and 2's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of.) Oh well, can't have it all....

review/summary: Olden, No Longer Golden
review/text: Amazon shipped these to me in September 09.  The label on each fig package clearly states "Best Before 25 August 09".  They were a very dark golden when I received them but are now the same blackish dark like mission figs, which is what I usually buy.  Shame on you, Amazon, for either not catching the old stock or for hoping I wouldn't catch it.  That being said, I get a lot of things from Amazon and overall am quite satisfied with my dealings with them.  I am going to chalk this up as a rare oversight and move forward.<br /><br />The figs themselves are good, and a nice change of pace from the little mission figlets I usually get.  When I bought these, they were discounted quite a bit.  Had they been twenty dollars for the six packages as they are now, I would not have ordered them.  That is too much for what you get.

review/text: At first I was skeptical about the packaging concept for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6BJK">Tsp Spices Ground Organic Nutmeg, 12 One-teaspoon Packets, 4-Ounce Tins (Pack of 3)</a>and thought perhaps it was over-packaged, but once I tried it, I have to say I love it!<br /><br />I prefer for my spices to be organic and as fresh as possible.  Some dried spices, such as nutmeg in particular, once the jar is opened, I cannot use the spice frequently enough before the flavor stales and fades to dust.  With these clever little one-teaspoon packets, which really are the perfect measurement for my recipes, I have incredibly fresh, organic ground nutmeg every time.  The integrity of the nutmeg is not lost and being a raw foodie, I take special delight in such freshness. Uncooked spices tend to be more intense and really stand out.  I love the vibrant flavor of this nutmeg in some of my favorite raw recipes. ( My raw nutmeg coconut cookies are divine! )<br /><br />The little tins are sweet too.  This is just an all-round wonderful product, organic product and I am eager to try some of the other Tsp Spices.

review/text: My first objection to the mix was the difficulty of preparation. I buy mixes for ease expecting to add water or milk and maybe an egg, not all three plus melted butter. That being said, I mixed all expecting something wonderful. The batter smelled like soapy dish water to the point of making me feel ill. I sampled the batter and found it to be a strong smelling buttermilk batter with some occasional ( far too few) spirgs of coconut floating around. I prepared the batter and was sorely disappointed in the waffle. The next time I doctored the batter with sugar and vanilla but was still disappointed in the final product.<br />  If this were an actual store -- I would return it but returns are too much trouble over the internet assuming they take it back.I would be willing to try another of thier products if they would swap out the coconut but I'm not holding my breath that they will offer.<br />  My verdict --Save your money, its buttermilk batter mix with too acid a bite to the buttermilk and a foul smell.

review/summary: Steep too Long and It's Bitter
review/text: The mint in this tea is very good, but it's not the oily strong mint that I get with some flavored teas. The mint leaves are dried and they are a bit weak. When steeped for too long or if too much tea is used, the tea gets very bitter. However, I can put in a spoonful of the leaves in the hot water, and refill or top off the cup two more times without losing major flavor of the tea.<br /><br />This mint teas is wonderful for after dinner. I love the way it seems to settle my stomach. It's become a regular after-dinner tea. I received it as a gift, and while I have tasted some teas with a stronger, oilier mint flavor, this one is nice in that it doesn't have the essential oil floating in it that can sometimes irritate the lips or the stomach. This has the real mint leaves dried in the tea to steep. Adding a few sprigs/leaves of fresh mint to the tea and lightly mottling/crushing them in the cup right before adding the water makes a huge difference and really enhances this tea.<br /><br />But even without that, this is a great tea, high quality green tea, delicate flavor. Just don't use too much of the tea so it doesn't get bitter. As for steeping time, I just throw the spoonful in with the hot water loose, so I steep it the whole time I'm sipping it and it doesn't get bitter or lose flavor at all. I prefer that to using a strainer or bag for brewing. I love drinking tea and herbal mixes loose like that.<br /><br />I think most people, especially for the price, will like this tea if they like mint teas in general.

review/text: This tea is great, but alas, it has a big flaw for me, there is a lack of strong mint flavoring in this mix. I definitely expected a strong mint taste mixing well with the green tea, but there's a lack of mint taste here. You can see the leaves in there, but the taste is lacking.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great green tea. I suggest steeping it for longer than the directions say, but definitely not longer than 3 minutes. Maybe even adding a bit of spearmint herbal tea will help?

review/summary: Java took a back seat to this fine tea
review/text: About 3 years ago I was intrigued with all health benefits associated with green tea.<br /><br />I decided to give it a whirl.<br /><br />I should mention that since my late teens I had been a drip (black)coffee lover (no cream or sugar the stronger the better).<br /><br />I started out with the usual Safeway green tea brands...Bigelow, Stack,  etc... and while the tea was o.k. and I began slowly replacing my usual 10 cups of java a day with the green tea I was concerned about the price....20 tea bags for about an average of 3  bucks.<br /><br />One day I walked into an asian supermarket here in Seattle and found a green tea I had never tried before...Stassen Jasmine Green Tea.<br /><br />I always thought there was nothing like the smell of fresh brewed coffee in the morning ...and I still treasure that aroma..but now I enjoy  Stassen Jasmine Green Tea and how its delicate aroma is part of the enjoyment of sipping this health laden beverage.<br /><br />Never thought coffee would take the back seat to tea (I still have one cup of black coffee every afternoon so that we remain friends though not as close as we once were) but that's what this wonderful Stassen Jasmine Green Tea has done to me.<br /><br />I drink a lot of it.  I feel less jittery. It doesn't have that acidy thing about it like coffee and I just feel flat out more healthy drinking it.  And I never tire of inhaling that captivating jasmine with every cup I pour.<br />I also find the 100 bag box of Stassen Jasmine Green Tea a far better value than what Safeway has to offer.

review/summary: Best tasting Jasmine Tea in US
review/text: Being originally from Taipei Taiwan, I'm puzzled over the years by the bland, below expectation Jasmine tea in the restaurants, from the Chinese grocery stores etc. It's like nobody take this popular tea seriously in the US. Sure, I enjoy my Oolong tea(from Nantou, Taiwan) tremendously, but sometimes nothing beats the pleasing, lingering aroma of Jasmine steaming up from the white porcelain cup ... IF you can find the right tea ... to me, that sure was memory afar. Then last week, someone placed a few tea bags in our Buddhist temple in Dallas, I picked one up, made the tea in a foam cup (shame on me), sipped it and immediately I reached for the tag that was dangling by the cup ... "Stassen", wow, this tea has the right combination of Jasmine fragrance and smooth green tea, my search is over. While waiting for my order to arrive, I can't help sniffing at the foam cup from time to time(shame on me twice).

review/text: My husband's co-worker gave him two bags of this to bring home.  It was unbelievable.  The best green tea I have had.  I thought I had the best at TenRen in Taipei, but this is great.  The aroma is incomparable.

review/summary: Jasmine Green Tea.. Yummy!
review/text: I've been consistently a black tea (and flavored) drinker for years. I tried plain green tea and almost wretched - I thought it was bland and boring.<br /><br />My boyfriend and I recently went to a restaurant where they used this as the 'hot tea' option. I stole the tag and went looking.  Luckily, I found it at the local asian market - where it is only $4.80 for a box of 100 - double bonus!! Found the tea, and at a great price.  Needless to say, bf and I finished a box in less than a month.<br /><br />The perfect marriage of jasmine scent and flavor with green tea. Add a touch of honey if you prefer and enjoy!

review/summary: Like Drinking Perfume or Incense
review/text: I was taken by the raving reviews of this product. Seven reviews and all seven rated the product with 5 stars. I thought this was amazing, so I bought the product and I have to wonder if the products producer didn't provide these ratings.<br />I love green tea, but this is too much. If the floral was subdued it might be real nice, but this bold floral taste makes me feel like I'm drinking Mom's favorite perfume, or gargling with aftershave to cover-up bad breath.<br />I don't know if I can develop a taste for this, but I almost have to, since I have 99 more cups to drink!

review/summary: Vile tasting
review/text: I am not a picky eater.  I love to try different foods, and enjoy nearly all ethnic foods.  That said, this rub is awful.  It is hard to describe a flavor in words, but the closest I can come are bitter, and rancid.  It is not merely a taste we did not like, it is so bad it is almost impossible to eat.  Save your money, and do not buy this like I did.
