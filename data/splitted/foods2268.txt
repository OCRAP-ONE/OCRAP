review/summary: Very good, smooth coffee when fresh
review/text: I got my bag from Costco and it was really good. I'm not sure how Amazon's version is but the coffee I got was very smooth and not at all acidic or sour as others complained. The batch must have been really fresh since the glass container I put it in would pop every time I opened it. When I roast coffee, this will occur from the gasses being released and expanding. Again, I got mine from Costco and from my guess, they take orders and have them filled directly from the company, so it was pretty fresh. The price was very decent for organic fair trade as well. Even for espressos, latte's and cap's, it's a very nice coffee. Highly recommend. Suggestion, don't over grind or drink after coffee has been sitting too long, it will get sour and/or bitter. Don't buy coffee that's been sitting on shelves too long either.<br /><br />Oh yeah, DON'T EVER BUY COFFEE FROM TJMAXX, MARSHALL'S, ROSS, OR HOME GOODS (I know, they're basically the same store). Every time I've bought a food item from these companies it was horrid!! A batch of coffee I got from TJMaxx turned to dust when I tried to grind it!? They wouldn't take it back either. Even the clothes are irregular, but food items, forgettabboutit.

review/summary: Chocolaty.Soury aftertaste.
review/text: I've had a different experience with this particular whole bean medium roast coffee.<br />The coffee beans smell fine.I made a brew,and I found a very pleasant chocolaty taste.<br />But,the aftertaste was soury like.The aftertaste seemed unpleasant.Tested it few more<br />times in following day.One time it seemed OK.The other time, an unpleasant aftertaste<br />was still there.Also,I noticed an acidic smell of an organic origin on a brew.<br />Also, the overall feeling was not as pleasant as after Camano Brazilian or Sumatra<br />cup of coffee.I had to decide if I'd like to keep this 5-pound Papua NG bag.<br />The chocolaty particular taste,which I didn't experience as strong in other types<br />of coffee,was certainly Pros.But,that soury/acidity aftertaste and smell was<br />Cons.I think I'd keep a pound bag.But, for the 5-pound version,I decided not<br />to go with.I had to return it thought I bought it for $39 with free shiping<br />(12 dollars less than Amazon offers).It might have been the case with a<br />strange batch.I'm wondering what kind of organic subtitute they use growing<br />this particular coffee type.It might be the minerals on the other side,<br />which give this urine acidity like light aftertaste and an occasional smell.<br />I don't know.But,if you've never tried it,I'd order a smaller bag before<br />giving a try to this 5-pound one.

review/summary: Very mild. low acid
review/text: This is a great deal on this coffee especially w/ subscribe and save. It is a very mild coffee and if you have issues w/ reflux it is very low acid and I have not experienced reflux w/ this coffee. I ordered the medium roast and started mixing it 50/50 w/ another brand of organic decaffeinated coffee that I purchased locally. If you are a french roast or Starbucks fan, you probably will not like it being so mild. I do have to use more beans w/ this type which I did not when I used this brand's Peru decaffeinated light roast which I also found to be low acid.

review/text: I got this as a treat for my nephews one summer.  They all liked it a lot, as none of them had ever seen honeycomb.  You have to kind of get over the mental "I'm eating wax...." factor as you munch in to it, but it tastes just like fresh honey.  We ate it on sour dough bread coated thinly with salted butter, with peanut butter on that.

review/summary: If you've  never had good honeycomb, this is okay...
review/text: ...but if you've had the good stuff, this is a little bit disappointing. The wax is very waxy tasting, instead of being really infused with the honey and instead of being soft and pliable, it was brittle, which is something I've never experienced with honeycomb. Additionally, the comb part wasn't full and complete--the edges were broken and there were broken 'holes' in the interior part of it, instead of being a weavy-comb like it should have been.<br /><br />On the plus side, there was a good amount of honey in the box and the plastic packaging that it's in is hard plastic with an easy enough pop top to it. When the product was delivered, it had melted and slid all to one side, and had leaked out of the packaging. I'm not rating this product by the packaging or the shipping though (I gave shipping feedback elsewhere). This is just about the honeycomb product inside.<br /><br />It's not bad and if you've never had the good stuff, for a fair price, this one is fine enough maybe to get for the kids to try it. If you're wanting it for cooking, for a gourmet or specialty display or to use for something that requires a solid, full and soft, pliable wax, this isn't your product.<br /><br />But for just sucking on some honeycomb and chewing some wax, for kids who don't know the difference, or even for breaking off a piece to drop into a tea or a hot drink, this is good enough, at a fair enough price.

review/text: I had not had honey comb in over 40 years.  I ordered a bottle of honey comb from a local company here in las vegas.  It cost $10 for a small bottle of honey with a small cube of honey comb.  It was good.  Then I found this honey comb on amazon and ordered it.  It was a huge piece of honey comb.  I took a bite of it this morning and I was in heaven.  It was much better than the other one I had gotten.  This is the best honey comb ever.  I will be ordering more of this comb.  Highly recommended.

Nature's Variety is great because we can change the flavor without switching foods and upsetting her digestive system. That being said, she usually gets tired of a flavor toward the end of the 30 pound bag, which lasts her a little over a month. But she never got tired of this flavor.

review/summary: Finally Relief
review/text: My Black Lab/Newfie has serious skin issues.  After much work and loving care I have found a food that works.  She was fed Pedigree for years and every year she had to have allergy shots for during the summer and spring months sometimes the fall months.  In recent years she has even gotten a layer of what appeared to be leather like black skin on her tummy.  I tried everything that I could, changed her food multiple times.  Finally realized she started to smell horribly.  So after much research I decided to try the Salmon Brown Rice and Oatmeal food.  This food with a supplement of Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil has worked fabulously.  The fur she lost has grown back.  I love this food.

review/text: i was really hoping my french and english bulldog would love this food! they love the beef and lamb versions, however, my frenchie will only eat this very reluctantly. my english will eat anything so he loved it. BOTH dogs have very loose stools after eating this variety and the same happened with the chicken. i am not sure why. i will only be buying the beef and lamb in the future and will have to ration the salmon into their meals periodically to use it all up as it is expensive to just throw away. not a big deal but it makes it a little more difficult to pick up after they do their "thing". the salmon also has a very fishy smell which is good because it means that natures variety is using quality ingredients, however, my husband hates the smell of salmon and does not enjoy giving it to the dogs :)

review/summary: Excellent Dog Food
review/text: I have two male French Bulldog's both around 2.5 years old and have run the gamut looking for a suitable dog food that I felt was both healthy for my dogs and something they would actually enjoy eating.<br /><br />Previous to switching to Nature's Variety I was feeding my dogs a brand called Taste of the Wild. We had good results with that food and I even rated it here on Amazon at 5-stars. However, I believe that one of my Frenchies was developing an allergy to something in that food. Needless to say we decided to switch dog foods (again) and after doing much research stumbled onto Nature's Variety.<br /><br />There's a lot to like about this dog food that in my opinion ranks it highly with other top-tier brands such as Orijen, Canidae, Innova and others. First, the formula is grain free - a must in my household. The main proteins used in the different formulas aren't by-product like in many mainstream brands. The first ingredients listed on the label are proteins and not fillers.<br /><br />The manufacturer claims that their formulas are meant to be interchangeable. In our household we have successfully been practicing rotation feeding with Nature's Variety Prairie formulas with very minimal side effects. With other brands we've used in the past rotation feeding has been very difficult even with gradual integration of the new food over a 2 week period.<br /><br />Lastly and maybe most importantly our dogs devour their food. This is coming from a household with two very discerning Frenchies!<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Picky Papillons Love It
review/text: My Papillons (ages 8 and 9) have been the pickiest damn dogs I have ever met.  You know when the vet says "they will eat eventually, they won't starve"?  Well, no.  These damn dogs would starve if they didn't get to eat something they liked.  I have been struggling for years to find food that is not made in China, not made from chicken from China even if manufactured in the USA.  Finally, I found Halo.  I integrated the Halo Spots Stew kibble and the Halo Spot's Stew chicken canned into the Paps diet over 2 weeks.  Week one they ate half of the Halo and by the end of week two they were eating ALL of the Halo product and the small amount of the old brand was left in their bowls.  Their skin is fantastic, their poops are a perfect consistency (not too hard or too soft) and they are energetic and just happy and excited for meal time now.  I also feed them the Halo LiL Bits freeze dried chicken treats.  All of the ingredients are from USA and made solely here.  And, I am thrilled that my favorite TV talk show host, Ms. Ellen Degeneres is a part owner of the company.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for offering this here as it is hard to get in my somewhat small town pet stores who seem to cater to gross China food that will make all our dogs sick.

review/summary: my dogs love it
review/text: I have spent 2 years trying to find some sort of dog food that won't break the bank, that's made with dog health in mind, and that my dogs actually like. having said that, I was truly skeptical about buying this, simply because of the price. I mean, it's dog food, they all look the same. But. it's. awesome. I started off by mixing in a spoon full of it into their regular food, and for the first time ever my dogs were cleaning their plates. its got chunks of real vegetables in it, and in combination with the dried food (also Halo, I mix the salmon with the lamb) my dogs are eating like kings and queens: 3 types of meat, 15 types of veggies & fruits...wow.<br /><br />I'm totally in love with this brand. I have switched over EVERYTHING, their treats, their dry food and their wet food.if halo comes out with a flavored water supplement for dogs, I'll probably buy that too. its just a great brand, reliable, and with a conscience.

review/summary: Only dog food I will use
review/text: After reading horrible reviews about dog food and with the onset of my puppy having seizures, I made him only home cooked meals specifically for dogs.  He was having stomach problems and went through many different recipes always consulting with my Vet, but then I found Halo dog food.  My dog eats this and looks for more, his stomach problems have subsided and he's doing very well. This was such a relief due to his seizures and stomach problems and I tried so hard to make him well.  He's been on Halo canned chicken Spots Stew now for 2 months and I am so relieved.  Now if only I could do something about the seizures, all would be well.  However, I give very high recommendations for Halo food.  A bit expensive, but worth every penny.  I need to add that I know how much Ellen Degeneres loves dogs and put my trust in her advocating Halo food.  I'm not sorry. Thanks Ellen.  Thanks Amazon for carrying it and offering monthly subscriptions.

I cannot figure out how they make it taste like pie with only these ingredients but they do. How wonderful to have an item with such a short healthy ingredient list.<br /><br />My second favorite so far is the Lemon Bar, it's really good too, and has only 5 ingredients. Key Lime Pie is good... heck, they're all good!<br /><br />So refreshing to eat something that tastes so decadent, and is made from whole foods, thanks Lara Bar! :-)

review/summary: Larabar Key Lime Pie
review/text: Yum!  This was my first experience with a Larabar and I really liked it.  I love key lime pie to begin with, so I was beyond excited to find a bar in that flavor.<br /><br />While it didn't taste exactly like a Key Lime Pie, this bar did have a lot of lime flavor.  It also had some crunchy nuts that contrasted nicely with the almost fruit chews texture of the rest of the bar.  I also was able to taste the hint of coconut in there as well.  Between those three flavors, it tasted very fresh and almost like I was eating a fruit salad in bar form.  Definitely a pleasant experience.<br /><br />The ingredient list on this bar is phenomenal.  Only 5 ingredients are in it:  dates, cashews, almonds, coconut, and lime juice.  That's it, no hard to pronounce ingredients, no added sweeteners, just plain food that is easily recognized by just about anyone.  In fact, according to the package, because of those ingredients, this bar equals 1/4 of a cup of fruit.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, this bar is about on par with most other fitness bars.  It has 220 calories, which is high for a snack but good for if you're working out or as a meal replacement.  Sugars are high, 24 grams, but at least it's from all natural foods and not because they dumped a pile of sugar in the bar.  There's also some vitamins hiding in there, but those too aren't from vitamins injected into the food.<br /><br />A pretty good bar.  I'm eager to try out the other Larabars and see if they're just as good.  And I know I'll definitely be buying this one again.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Simply Delightful
review/text: I love a Larabar as a snack at work.  I don't get breaks or lunches, so I eat one mid-shift which holds me over well until I get home to eat a real meal.  They're convenient to throw in my purse, and are easy to eat.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Super healthy.  Three simple ingredients, no fillers, no added sugars.<br />- Good source of protein, plus a handful of vitamins and minerals.<br />- Very tasty.  Slightly sweet, and fresh peanut taste.<br />- Soft and chewy, easy to eat.  The peanuts are ground into small pieces, which I really like.  They're plentiful and blended perfectly with the dates.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Make me thirsty.  I recommend at least a little water after eating.<br />- A bit pricey.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I just love these Larabars.  They don't taste just like a peanut butter cookie, but they do have a wonderful flavor which I found surprising given the ingredients.  I love that there is no added sugars.  One bar makes me feel great after I eat it, and there is no sugar crash later on.  With protein and fiber, it's a great choice.  Also, it's gluten-free and dairy-free for individuals who cannot consume either of those two things.<br /><br />I highly recommend!

review/text: Being an elite cyclist and always looking for healthy nutrition that tastes great I have tried a lot of bars. Larabar have become my only choice for a snackbar while riding. They are great tasting soft and easy to chew while riding. Best of all they are not loaded with any artificial crap or fillers.

review/summary: Gingerbread without the guilt
review/text: At Christmastime, I made gingerbread men that I rolled out thick so they would retain their softness. They were good -- so good that I put on more pounds than I wanted because I enjoyed them so. But it's hard to find that spicy ginger taste that satisfies. Most gingerbreads and gingersnaps are lacking.<br /><br />In February, I started eating paleo. (Look it up - I won't explain it here.) For the occasional "cheat," I wanted something naturally sweetened without glutens or grains. Many paleo/primal websites recommend Larabars. I've eaten them before but never the Ginger Snap variety.<br /><br />O.M.G. They hit the spot and then some. What an indulgence -- and they remind me of my fattening gingerbread men from Christmas. Soft and chewy with that marvelous gingerbread taste. So worth it.<br /><br />So whether you're eating paleo, gluten free, natural whole foods or just want a good for you treat, Ginger Snap is it for ginger lovers.

review/summary: Cinnamon Roll
review/text: This Larabar tastes just like a cinnamon roll!!!  I don't know how those Larabar people do it, but whatever the flavor of Larabar it is, it tastes just like the real thing!!!  This particular Larabar is cinnamon roll, therefore, it goes good with a cup of coffee.  And in this cold weather lately, good hot coffee has been welcome!!!  I've been having my share lately of good hot coffee and Larabars!!!  And if you like cinnamon rolls, I'm sure you would love this particular Larabar.<br /><br />And for hot weather, or for the flavors of Larabars that go better with cold beverages, cold iced tea works very well also with Larabars.<br /><br />Oh, and I need to tell you, Larabars are natural - no added sugar, only natural sugar from fruits.  There are no bad ingredients.  There is also no soy.  Larabars are healthy, convenient, filling, perfect.  And vegan.  And even if you aren't vegan, you can still eat Larabars because they are so good.  They are so good, you forget that they are made from healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Cinnamon Roll Larabar.  Highly Recommended.

review/text: I'm always trying different "energy bar" type products. Lately I've been eating the Larabar during my long XC skiing tours. I've got to say that I think these are one of the best tasting bars I've eaten... ever. I love the tangy taste of the cherry and it is also good news to me that it is made with raw ingredients, no added sugar and no saturated fat (cholesterol free).<br /><br />The closest thing I could equate this bar to would be the inside of a fig newton cookie. It's firmer though and has more pronounced cherry flavor. I find it satisfying and I do "feel good" about eating it. I also like Cliff Bars but if I had only these two to choose from, I'd choose the Larabar Cherry Pie. Yum.

review/text: I'm off gluten and trying to wean myself off dairy as well.  Larabar pecan pie has no gluten or dairy, and it actually tastes great!  The bars are 1.6 ounces, which I find just the right size for a snack.  The pecan flavor is sweet, but not too sweet, and the bar has a nice balance between soft and crunchy. There are 220 calories in each bar, and 130 of them are fat calories, but this is FAR healthier for you than any candy bar.  Ingredients are dates, pecans, and almonds- amazingly simple!<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Pretty good - though flavor not all I had hoped
review/text: These are, like all LaraBars, flavorful, filling, and made of simple ingredients.  The flavor wasn't all I'd hoped, given some of the reviews - they're cherry pie LaraBars with chopped peanuts added - a little peanut taste as you bite into them, and a peanut aftertaste.  What I loved about peanut butter sandwiches was the way the richness of the peanut butter contrasted with the fruitiness of the jelly.<br /><br />These bars don't do it for me, since they lack the rich peanut butter taste I love.  However, they're not at all bad in themselves (just not so good that they'd make my favorites list, where apple pie remains at the top, though I've never tried a LaraBar I really didn't like).

review/summary: As healthy as bars get
review/text: The raw nuts and fruits in these bars make them as close to nature as anything you will find in a wrapper. The Larabar reminds me of the naturally zesty and sweet fruit rolls I used to eat as a kid but also has wonderful, flavorfull fresh nuts mixed in. Raw nuts contain healthy fats and the protein and fat in the nuts will lower the glycemic index of the food. If you don't want to lug around raw cherries and a snack bag of raw nuts, this is the convenient alternative.<br /><br />Keep in mind, these are excellent treats for pets too. They are especially nice for birds who like to pick at the dried fruit and munch on the raw nuts. If you are going to offer these to a pet, please check the ingredients to be sure they are compatible with your species of pet.

review/text: I've tried many bars over the years, from snack bars to energy bars. These bars are the best tasting and are great in any flavor, but my favorite flavor is Peanut Butter Cookie as it's not too sweet. Being gluten sensitive and struggling with low blood sugar, Lara Bars are the perfect balanced snack for me when on the go whether I'm running errands or exercising. I ride a bicycle for many miles and carry a couple of Lara Bars, some fruit, and water. As a result, I feel sufficiently fueled for my rides and do not encounter any stomach distress.

review/summary: Yummy G/F Alternative!
review/text: First let me state that I've only tried 3 flavors so far (chocolate coconut, cocoa mole', and apple pie).<br /><br />I found chocolate coconut to be my least favorite. Normally I like the chocolate coconut combination, but in this brand it just didn't work for me!  If I had to rate it, I'd only give it 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that cocoa mole' was a huge improvement (so if you're in the mood for something chocolaty- I would highly recommend this)!!  The cinnamon/chili combo is very unique (but shouldn't be a surprise if you know what mole' is).  The cinnamon is comforting, and the chili gives it a little zing- with a faint hint of heat.<br /><br />  The apple pie flavor is so far my favorite out of the three.  You can definitely taste the distinct apple cinnamon flavor.  I'm not sure if I encountered a rasin in mine though.  I also like that it has walnuts in it.<br /><br />  Anyway, I can't wait to sample other flavors!  ..I hope they come up with a new flavor that involves macadamia nuts!!

This is disappointing because I am familiar with this product and I know what flavor to expect. I still like LaraBar and will continue to consume it but my next purchase will have to be from a brick and mortar location where I can sample an individual bar prior to purchasing a full box.<br />Upon my request Amazon had issued a full refund for this purchase.

review/text: I can't believe some people actually manage to compare these bars to Snickers or other fake-ingredient bars. Really? A 200 calories of fruit and nuts vs. hydrogenated, high-fructose, heart-attack calling candy bars should really make this decision easy.<br />I actually came across Larabars just recently. I heard about them, but I was just never too curious to actually read the ingredients and try one. To give a little background on my life-style, I do all of my own cooking to make sure I know exactly what goes into it. I stray away from all the processed foods and I don't eat grains and starches such as potatoes. I also don't eat refined sugars as it falls into a category of processed foods. With that said, I am a human being and I do get cravings for something dessert-like. I have very high standards for my dessert. It has to be all-natural, unprocessed, and preferably without added sweeteners. With all of those requirements one has to pretty much always prepare their desserts from scratch because there aren't whole lot of prepackaged foods out there that have that same philosophy about preparing it. Larabar is one of the very few out there who actually got it right.<br />I was a little skeptical about the taste of the bars when I bought a couple to sample, but they all exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be buying them in the future.<br />Now, I wouldn't overindulge in eating a few of those a day as they are still plenty sweet and carbolicious, but I usually have a few bites after lunch as a dessert treat. One bar lasts me 3-4 days and I will choose it over Snickers any time of the day.

review/text: I love that this has a fair amount of protein and the only sugar source is directly from the fruit.  I also love that it has a VERY short ingredient list.  This is why I picked this bar for my kids, who have several allergies, including gluten and soy.  My favorite flavor by far is the Pistachio.  DS aged 4 agrees with me.  He only wants the green one!

review/text: I love the fact that the gluten-free products by larabar say so right on the display box in the store so it takes the guess work out of it for you. They taste just like the flavor they're supposed to and aren't too sweet for a quick snack. They still hold you over until you can get some actual food in your stomach, which is great. I keep these around as much as I can! My favorite GF flavors are key lime pie, pecan pie, apple pie, and banana nut bread.

review/summary: Wonderful fruit and nuts on the go
review/text: This bar is great for getting raw fruit and nuts into your family. Could the nuts be chopped a bit smaller? Sure. But then the whole bar would be too mushy. Could they use fewer dates (to cut the sugar) and make the bar as moist? Doubtful. Cheries are tough as dried fruit goes, and I'm guessing that's the reason for the excessive dates. (Note, though, I can't stand plain dates and I don't notice the flavor or find them overwhelming. I'd just like a more tart, less sweet bar.)<br />This is the alternative to giving yourself and your family dried fruit--this bar is softer, easier to share, and slightly more flavorful than the best dried fruit. It makes nuts palatable to kids who think they don't like nuts. And that means more protein into your diet (though not as much as I'd like, it has exponentially more than plain fruit).<br />Great bar. Good price through Amazon. Stash these bars in your car, your briefcase, your desk drawer, your diaper bag, your kids' backpacks, and your family's workout bags.

review/text: While looking for a healthy, all natural, food to eat on my long runs, i found the larabars. I had tried some other bars that were more fruity and had some sugar crashes. The larabars did not cause that effect on me. I have tried many of the flavors and find them surprisingly delicious for something so healthy. The cinnamon roll, cashew cookie, apple pie, and gingersnap are my favorites so far. The cherry pie was too cherry for me. This is a snack you can feel good about eating!

From the look of it and my experience with natural snack bars in the past, I was not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was VERY sweet and tasty, despite having no added sugar and all of THREE natural ingredients.  Sure, it's 200 calories, but it's filling and satisfied my (huge) sweet tooth.  I can't wait to try other flavors!

review/text: Lara bars are easy to pack in a purse or desk drawer, make a full meal [for me] with a glass of milk, and taste good. I'm amazed that they are able to make so many different flavored bars using so few ingredients. Only one thing would make Lara perfect: being able to buy a 'variety' box. I don't have enough room in my small kitchen to keep a box of each kind.

review/summary: Great gluten-free snack
review/text: I started picking up these bars at the health food store after I had to give up granola bars.  The cherry pie bars taste amazingly like the real filling, except without all the unnecessary sugar.  The bars are sweet enough on their own and the nuts add a delightful crunch.  The other flavors are delicious as well.  The price of the individual bars can fluctuate by more than sixty cents depending on the vendor and Amazon sells them for less as a large package than the individuals would cost at the cheapest store.  The organic ingredients and lack of additives ensure that the bars are gluten-free, but are still tasty.

While a bit more expensive than the Cliff Bars I had been buying, these were an absolute treat and I plan to purchase more.  The all-natural raw foods approach makes for the best snack bar I've ever had - delicious, not over-sweetened, no sticky aftertaste, not too dry, and one bar was often the perfect mid-afternoon snack to carry me over until dinner.  I tried the chocolate version and found it a little too dry for my taste, but similarly well flavored.

review/text: I am taste testing the Larabars, and the Cashew Cookie bars are wonderful - they have the consistency of the canned Halvah that you get in the gourmet stores, but has a cashewy taste.<br />Of all the flavors I have tried, the Pecan Pie, the Cinnamon Roll, and the Cashew are my favorites.<br />The least favorites - Cherry Pie, Ginger Snap, and Banana.<br />The Apple Pie is good, but blander than the other flavors. The Chocolate Coconut is good, but the coconut flavor isn't as prominent, though it is worth getting.<br />Also if you have seen the Larabar site, they also have Maya Chocolate Bars - I got some, and my first taste was what I can only describe as 'turpentiney' - do not bother.<br />But these Larabars are a great meal replacement, or snack, and oh so healthy -<br />and a great price with Amazon.

I tried the "energy" bars and "nutrition" bars, but they all have fake sweeteners with that nasty aftertaste. Saw these in the grocery store and picked up a few different flavours. WOW!! All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think.

They're not bad, but there is nothing else you can taste in those flavors besides dates and nuts. I would buy one to try before investing in a whole box of the flavor you're looking for.

review/text: The creators of this flavor (in the excellent larabar line of energy bars) got the lemon flavor perfect;but why did they leave out the potassium common in most other selections?The potassium is what makes the good "well being" feeling after you have digested this wonderful fiber heavy food and without that you get a curious hollow feeling when you are supposed to be humming.That is Humm Foods goal, after all.I wonder what lara was thinking about with this one flavor?I would suggest a re-working of the lemon selection to incorporate more minerals.( especially the potassium).Otherwise, these are great bars; the cherry pie and cinnemon roll are the best ,followed by banana cookie,pecan pie,and apple pie of the flavors I have tried.But as everyone knows, most no other opinion is more subjective than taste.

review/summary: This is what a really healthy snack bar is ....
review/text: I think that this series of Larabar is what a real healthy snack should contain. If you look at the ingredients on all of this series of Larabars, then you'll see that it has only 3-4 ingredients like the fruit itself, dates and some form of nuts. It doesn't have sugar, salt or other preservatives. Because of the dates, it has natural sweetness and because of the nuts, it has natural saltiness. The nuts also give this bar it's calories (an average bar is about 200 calories).  The taste is well ... not like eating a Nature Valley snack bar. The taste is more like eating mashed fruit and nuts mixed together with dates. If you don't like dates or have a thing against dates, I wouldn't buy any of this series of Larabars because 90% of them have dates as a main ingredients. I think they use it as a natural binder. Because of this, I find that a majority of their bars taste kind of the same ... heavily flavored with dates.<br /><br />But, if you're trying to snack healthily and want to avoid processed foods and those sugary / salty snacks in the "snack bar" aisle at the supermarket, this is the bar to go with. Plus, if you buy it in bulk from Amazon, it comes out to be less than $1.25 / bar whereas at the markets it can go as high as $2.00+ / bar.  You just need to go the market and try all the flavors first before you commit to 16 bars of the same flavor at Amazon. It would suck to order 16 bars of a flavor and find out that you can stand the taste of it after the fact.

review/text: So far I have tried the Key Lime Pie, Cherry Pie, and the Peanut butter cookie and they all have all had really good flavor without having all the extra processed junk that so many other snack foods have.  I look forward to trying more flavors.

review/summary: Moldy! Full of a white fuzzy mold!
review/text: Every one of the bars have a white fuzzy mold on them. It is disgusting!<br /><br />Fortunately, I received a refund; without having to go through the hassle of having to package them up and send them back.

review/summary: Most Delicous Larabar EVER EVER EVER!
review/text: First of all, if you haven't tried Larabars yet, you're missing out!  All of their flavors taste just like their names.  Before I tried the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, my favorite flavor Larabar was Key Lime Pie (it tastes just like real key lime pie but is so much better for you!)  What first impressed me about Larabar is that I can pronounce all of their ingredients.  What next impressed me was that my picky 3 year old would eat them! He's now 5 and these are still his favorite snack.  Perfect way to get him some healthy, natural calories when he won't eat anything else.  These are my favorite breakfast, and they're best refrigerated.  They're a staple in our house.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Yum
review/text: So I was going to the store in the morning and then I saw this Larabar in my pocket. I ate it, and my hunger is all gone, so instead of the store I rolled to the park and took a walk.  True story.

review/text: I love the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. Its amazing. Good product--mostly filling for something on the go. Would recommend. Package got to me in 2 days with Amazon Prime. It came in good condition. Was a little worried about melting but I haven't experienced that as being an issue.

review/summary: Super tasty and gluten free
review/text: Love these bars. They're easy to tote around and taste like real food! They actually satisfy peanut butter/chocolate cravings! Plus they're gluten free. I've purchased these at different places. They were on sale here and qualified for free shipping...I got two boxes since they tend to go fast!

review/summary: Simple, Flavorful, Satiating
review/text: These satiate my need for either a quick breakfast or something to eat in the afternoon for a snack when I need something I can carry in my purse. I've tried the lemon and the apple pie. I've very please with them both, but I didn't have unrealistic expectations for them. We, socially, have his idea that for example if we're unwrapping the lemon bar it's going to be bright yellow, vibrant, and very lemony. Not the case. They come out brown and nutty with a light, fragrant lemon flavor. The apple pie is the same. Unwrapped it is a brownie sized cut of brown apple pulp with ample nuts mixed in; very simple, tasty, and meets my need for a quick boost of fruit that won't immediate spoil like buying the freshest of produce might.

review/summary: Wonderfully delicious . . .
review/text: I have always enjoyed LaraBars and these cherry pie bars are delightful.  Just three ingredients: dates, almonds, and cherries, these bars are a great texture and slightly sour cherry flavor.  The bars are 200 calories, but you can't argue with the quality of the ingredients and these bars are very satisfying.  I look forward to trying hte other fruit and nut flavors, but I can highly recommend the cherry pie flavor!
