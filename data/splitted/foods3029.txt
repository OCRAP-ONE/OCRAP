review/summary: Bun for my hotdog? Check!
review/text: Udi's has quickly become my favorite gluten-free bread brand because of flavor, texture, and variety. The hotdog buns held together and were a great compliment to the rest of the hotdog. They do taste slightly sweeter than the average wheat buns, but that wasn't a problem for me. Thankfully, they don't have that "chewy, stick to the roof of your mouth" feel like classic gluten-filled white breads often have.

review/summary: Easy, refreshing and finally no caffeine!
review/text: I am addicted to this stuff it's practically the only thing I drink these days. I admit at first I found the flavor a little unusual, but I've come to love it and the flavoring is all quite natural which is nice. Just various fruits and whatnot. The big thing for me was the no caffeine though. I love iced tea but brewing pitchers of iced tea every day and then waiting for them to cool was a hassle so it was great when cool brew tea first came out back in the day, however, drinking a full pitcher every day( which I often do) could be an issue with all the caffeine, so finding this decaf flavor was perfect.

review/summary: Good -- but don't get it near heat
review/text: This tea is designed to cold-brew.  Do not question the packaging!<br />If you brew in cold water, you'll get a refreshingly light fruity blend that's lovely on a hot summer day.<br /><br />If you hot brew it, you'll instead be met with a chemically-bitter, awful concoction that would be lovely mainly compared with dehydration.<br /><br />This is a lot of tea bags, so you need to be serious about your iced tea to make the purchase.  If you are, I say go for it!  I look forward to someday trying the other flavors -- only five more boxes to go...

review/summary: Family loves it with stevia sweetner!
review/text: I brew a lot of herbal (no caffeine), fruit-flavored sun tea in the summer, as a family we drink 1 gal/day (Note: we don't drink black iced tea, so our taste buds aren't expecting that flavor). I usually use various flavored herbal tea bags, sometimes throwing in a few of these too, always sweetening with healthy, no-sugar stevia added to the whole pitcher. When we were caught without our daily gallon, I decided to make this "straight," since it brews quickly. Turns out my husband and son love this by itself! Told me it tastes (good) like some "bad for you" fruit juice flavored drink. As I pay $6/box at grocery store & it seems I will need to purchase much more, found it here on Amazon for much less, of course :-)

review/summary: More floral than fruity
review/text: I drink a lot of unsweetened iced tea and I love cold brew tea bags. I decided to give this product a try because I wanted to try something different. I've never seen this product in any grocery store where I live (Sacramento, CA) and decided to just buy the 6 pack.<br /><br />Taste: It's very floral. If you bother to read the ingredient list, the first thing listed is hibiscus flowers. I don't really care for the floral tastes in my tea, but it's not as overwhelming as other teas I've tried. I like my tea a little more on the over steeped side (for a cold brew tea bag) so I use two bags for a 12 oz cup. It has a fairly good fruity side, but not as fruity as I was expecting it to be.<br /><br />Also, it's caffeine free. I like my caffeine, but I knew that when I was buying this product.

It is quick and very easy to make and it does brew within five minutes. This tea is very full bodied and flavorful. I sweeten this with the light amber agave to keep the taste light and fresh. I feel this is a much better alternative to other fresh brewed ice teas and sodas, which my household does not drink. If you do decide to purchase this tea, take advantage of the adding this to your account as a monthly shipment, you will save money and have this on hand always. Bearing in mind, we all have different taste buds , I really feel you will not be disappointed, I am not,  never have been, I keep coming back for more.

review/text: So happy I found this product, as is my whole family. These noodles cook quickly (one minute) and are versatile enough to serve in many different ways. I have added them to soup, served with tamari, tofu, and vegetables, and next intend to put in spring rools (rice wrappers). They hold together well but can get very sticky if you overcook them. For best results add a bit of oil (or rinse well) after cooking so they are less apt to stick together. Good nutritional value overall, and very tasty.

I was soo happy to learn it did not have any preservatives and was made from organic ingredients. Because of this it has a shorter shelf life but it didn't last long in my house. I ordered 4 boxes and each contained 4 servings.  A total of 16 servings disappeared as quickly as it had arrived. I am going to have to try all the different flavor variations. Many of my family and friends have been asking me about these noodles. As the holidays are lurking around the corner, I will be ordering these noodles for my holiday gift baskets. It will be a hit for sure!

review/text: I really like these little fruit mints because they are sugar-free and not very minty (I don't like strong mint flavors). The artificial strawberry fruit taste is actually pleasantly mild, and the cool mint side is truly more "cooling" than minty. According to the package, there are about 37 of these mints per round box, which has a nifty little design offering a tab for "Not To Share" and a smaller tab for "To Share"--(please see my photos of this). The fruit side of the mint itself has a purposely bumpy texture, while the white side is smooth (see my photos). All in all, I enjoy these and recommend them to anyone looking for a sugar-free mint that is not overly minty with a mild fruit flavor.

On the other hand the gum cigarettes lasted much longer. Pretending and chewing gum are a great mix of 2 favorite activites. This Amazon offer gets you a whole case of 24 packs, and about 10 cigarretes per pack, thats over 240 gums. Also they come in 4 different art work packages in the case, they have really cool original retro designs from 30 years ago. Don't forget that Bubble Gum Cigars are also sold by the case at Amazon.

What flavor there was rested in the bottom of the tin and after sampling that, it tasted like 10% cheese, 5% jalapeno, and 85% salt.  Very weak: I gave them away to a co-worker that had no tastebuds and low standards - who was happy to have them for free.

review/text: One day, I was making a favorite bean and sausage soup and I started counting up the sodium content. For a "healthy" soup, one serving contained about 70% of the daily sodium requirements. Yikes! I jumped on Amazon and started searching for low sodium broth and beans. This broth is the one I found and the one I bought. Love it! It has great flavor and body and is the perfect soup starter. The "Less Sodium" broths (Swanson, etc.) are all about 24% per serving of the daily allowance for sodium. This broth is ultra low and is a much better base for soups. I like to cook up big pots of soup and then freeze in single servings for future meals and this broth holds up very well during the freezing/thawing/re-heating phases.

I first found this product at my local Hannaford & decided to buy a case of it online since I liked it so much & knew I would be using it on a regular basis. Great product that I recommend to others.

review/text: I have been an avid devotee of KITCHEN BASICS after attending a couple of cooking schools and the instructors all recommended that brand.  After reading the reviews on this product I thought it must really be good and I'll give it a try...big mistake! I've still to use up the last of it, even when I mix it with KITCHEN BASICS.  This product is, as the old saying goes..."bland as dishwater" compared to KITCHEN BASICS which is rich and full tasting.  I've learned my lesson.  I'll stick with my old friend.

review/summary: Good Salt!
review/text: I was at a health and wellness conference-- of all places-- when I was introduced to this salt by the manufacturer at the exhibitor's hall.  However, I had to agree with him that salt has taken a bit of a bad rap lately.  It isn't that salt is bad, it is the tons of salt dumped into most prepared foods that is bad!  Anyway, I was a bit skeptical at first about a better salt.  Isn't all salt the same?  The exhibitor gave me a bag to try when I got home.  Now it is all we use!  Maybe I am fooling myself, but this salt just seems to have so much more flavor!  And unlike bleached out white rice or white bread or washed out white salt, this naturally pink-colored salt has all the minerals nature originally put into it!

review/text: We first found this salt on a trip to Utah in the 90's and  brought some back home.  Used it, loved it, and at that time, was able to find an obscure online store that sold it so we bought some more but ran out long ago. Fast forward 7 years. We are SO happy to find this on Amazon.  This is the best salt...all of the trace minerals make it taste fabulous, we are actually using the salt more and really enjoying it but there are no side effects like puffiness or swelling hands.  I buy the large crystals so I can use it in my salt grinder.  It is really pretty and pink!

review/summary: TOO MUCH GRIT FROM SAND, BLACK PARTICLES
review/text: I purchased this product from Follow Your Heart natural food store in So. Cal.  I noticed big chunks of black particles in it.  I then went online to Amazon and found some people complaining about maybe chipping a tooth from hard substances.  Pre-preemptively, I pulverized this product in my mortar and pestle.  Have you ever been at the beach and you get sand in your food, and it is grinding in your teeth?  This has been my experience with this product, and I am returning it today and will never purchase any salt from this manufacturer.  Going back to Himalayan salt, and might try Celtic Salt for the first time, but not just now, I need a rest.

review/text: Found this salt in a Utah cafe on a road trip in 2003-ish. At that time I could only get replacements from the company on line, but I'd bother ordering a bunch it every couple of years because I can tell my body really responds well to this salt. The taste is delicious, and I don't bloat or feel puffy from it. I have since tasted many other sea salts since they are now so trendy... This is still my favorite! Now they sell it in nearby grocery stores, but not the course grind that I love in the salt grinder. So I'm on line to buy again!  Introduced it to a lot of friends over the years....

review/summary: My favorite spicy Korean "instant" noodles
review/text: I say that they're "instant" noodles because, to the uninitiated, it might come as a shock that you actually have to boil the noodles rather than simply soak them in boiling hot water.  The preparation time is still very quick, and it's definitely worth it.<br /><br />These noodles are far thicker and chewier than your standard supermarket Top Ramen noodles.  They also come with a spice package and a dry ingredients packet that contains bits of seaweed, mushrooms, and carrots.<br /><br />I usually only put in about 3/4 of the spice package and add extra ingredients like nappa cabbage, shrimp, scallops, green onions, mung bean sprouts, and/or an egg.  Kimchi also goes really well with these noodles.<br /><br />The bulk price that Amazon offers is an excellent deal, especially for people who don't have access to Asian supermarkets.  It's the perfect food to have for when you want a quick and flavorful meal.

review/summary: delicious but not for everyone
review/text: In my book, these noodles are even more delicious than the flagship shin ramyun "spicy picante". The noodles are coarser than even the shin variety, perhaps the coarsest noodles you'd find in a pack of instant ramen, and are billed as "udon type".  They certainly are chewier, and have a slight potato starch flavor, which is delicious.<br /><br />However, the ride-along packets may not be for everyone.  From what I understand, the company came up with these noodles after extensive taste-testing to make up for their relatively late start in the instant ramen industry.  However, bear in mind that these taste tests were done in Korea.  So if you don't like korean cuisine, you will not like these.  The soup base is fiery hot with a touch of squid flavor (tip: don't add the whole packet).  The vegetable packet is filled with seaweed (mainly kombu kelp), and tastes very fishy.<br /><br />Delicious I find these, but not everyone will.

review/summary: Mmm mmm good...
review/text: Incredibly tasty, incredibly spicy, just the way I like it! It does have the flavor of seafood but it's fairly mild. If you absolutely do not like the flavor of fish, this may be something to avoid. Try the kimchi flavor instead.<br /><br />Incredibly salty, one pack is supposed to provide 2 servings but let's be serious - maybe for kids, but I garnish mine with vegetables and it's a full meal. 480 cal per pack at just over TWO grams of salt (that's 2080 mg). For me that's over twice the amount of salt I normally intake daily. But it really works with this soup. I wouldn't eat it everyday unless I was going to sweat it off/out. Noodles are very good in consistency, hearty and slightly chewy without being tough. Don't overcook the noodles, they get soggy/mushy in the worst way and are absolutely (IMHO) unpalatable.

review/summary: Not what I'd hoped
review/text: I'm so sorry to say that this was not good at all.  I really had high hopes, since I am a huge fan of tortilla soup.<br />It was watery and had a strange flavor.  I made it according to the directions, too.  I'm just sad I have three boxes left over.  I also purchased the potato soup, but haven't tried it yet.

review/summary: Excellent starting point for making tortilla soup
review/text: All by itself, this isn't much, but you can turn it into an excellent tortilla soup with a little work.  After adding the soup mix to the water, we add peeled and chopped carrots, peeled and chopped potatoes, and chopped scallions.  If you like it hotter, add a drop of Dave's insanity sauce.  Cook for 20 minutes per the instructions. About five minutes before it is finished, we add frozen corn.  While the soup is heating up, we grill some skinned chicken breasts or thighs, cut them up and add them to the soup when it is done cooking.  Serve with tortilla chips and fresh cilantro. Sometimes we add a dollop of sour cream or plain yogurt.  You can also add black or other beans to the soup.  The advantage of using this package is that it has a nice selection of spices, it is relatively low in sodium for a soup (190 mg per serving), and it is fast to make.

review/summary: Totally enjoy this tea!
review/text: I read reviews on this product and if I hadn't tried it from my Mom first, would never have purchased it.  I'm so glad I did though.  I never tried the black tea version many other reviewers talked about.  THIS version I really like.  It's not sweetened so I feel I can drink it all day with no empty calories.  I add a bag to my s/s water bottle (28 or 32 oz) and leave it in.  I drink a couple of these a day.  It's a light flavor that I can drink all day long and really enjoy the taste (yes, it is a LIGHT flavor.  No matter how long I leave the bag in, it's still a light flavor - the tea doesn't get super strong but I like that about it).  I don't like plain water at all, so this is an excellent alternative plus I'm getting the added benies of antioxidants in the green tea.  My daughter is now a convert and asks to have a bag whenever she drinks her water.  My husband loves it as well.<br /><br />I've tried the other flavors of the Cool Brew Iced Tea and this one is by far my favorite.

review/summary: Ho Hum Brew
review/text: As a big fan of the old Cool Brew Blueberry Ice, I bought this because the other had been discontinued.  I thought this may have just be a "repackaging" (40 instead of 48 tea bags) and would taste the same.  I was very disappointed because this pale green tea had very little blueberry taste.  In fact, there was very little taste at all.  Since I have six boxes, I am experimenting with ways to make it palatable.  I'm adding a couple of bags of other teas (Blueberry Breeze) when I make it, to add a hint of flavor. I wouldn't recommend as a blueberry tea.  Guess it is a good alternative to water.  Hope Celestial Seasonings brings back the old version.

review/summary: The previous Blueberry Ice (non-green) was MUCH better
review/text: I purchase a case of this at a time as I drink iced tea in the summer and winter.  Previously Celestial Seasonings had a Blueberry Iced Tea and this new version is a Blueberry Ice GREEN tea.  I loved the old version and really do not like the new version.  The previous iced tea was really "blueberry" in taste, color and odor.  It was much smoother.  The new tea is simply not good - definitey not very blueberry-like.  I am exploring just purchasing their regular blueberry tea (not iced) from here on in.

review/summary: Great cold brew tea
review/text: My only recommendation is to let it "brew" for at least 10 minutes, probably even 20 to get a full bodied flavorful green tea with a hint of blueberry taste. It is not over-powering and perhaps that is the main complaint. Green tea alone is not very inviting to me, but this adds a nice fruity taste that is just right.<br /><br />It is unfortunate they do not sell this in stores, but I buy it 6 boxes at a time so I always have it on hand.

review/text: Didn't try the original blueberry Cool Brew tea from Celestial Seasonings, so we are not comparing this version to the previous version.  All we can say is this is a delicious, crisp green tea with just the right amount of blueberry flavor.  Have tried & enjoyed some other flavors of the brand and like the idea of drinking a healthier version with green tea. These Cool Brew teas are a warm weather staple in our house.

review/summary: Cool, Fresh, better than soda
review/text: Personally, I love this cool brew tea flavor, it is much, much better than regular iced teas.  It is cleaner, fresher, caffeine free and in my opinion very good. I know everyones taste buds are different, the taste of the tea is light, subtle,it is not overpowering, if this is what you like in an herbal tea than this is for you. I really like it and keep pitchers of it made year round as I am not a soda drinker, my choice, try it , it just may become yours too. I also recommend the Tropical Fruit cool brew also by Celestial Seansonings,another fav of mine.

review/summary: My Golden Approves.
review/text: I'm pretty pick about what I feed my beloved Golden Retriever.  (I adore my furr-baby.)  I stick to Blue Wilderness or Natural Balance for her dry kibble.  Of those options, this flovor of NB Alpha seems to be her current preference.<br />Higher grade kibble has substantially reduced our vet bills (Golden's are prone to ear infections---switching her to a higher quality protein diet a few years ago has totally eliminated hers!)<br />I trust this brand (and Blue Buffalo) and my dog approves.

review/summary: Picky Shiba Inu loves it....
review/text: My Shiba Inu started off eating Wellness Core and decided she really wasn't "that" into her food.  I switched her gradually into Natural balance starting off with the roll food mixed in with the Wellness and sometimes just as a treat. This year we went all Natural Balance Alpha dog and we started off gradually increasing the amount daily, as suggested on the bag.<br /><br />When switching out dog food it is very important that you introduce the new food gradually to your dog or else he/she will have stomach issues which could lead to diarrhea and the constant bowel movements.  My dog is a very picky eater and she absolutely loves this food.  Her poop is very firm and easy to handle after each movement, she has never had loose stools from eating this food and she only poops twice a day.<br /><br />Natural Balance Alpha Dog is ranked as one of the top 10 dog foods on the market; there are other flavors to choose from and I tend to go back and forth with all flavors.  Even my Norwegian Elkhound puppy eats his Wellness puppy food with some of this mixed in and once he gets older will be switching over to Natural Balance Alpha dog.<br /><br />I would recommend Natural Balance Alpha dog to anyone with picky eaters; however, I would also suggest that whenever switching out dog food it is very important that you don't do it cold turkey, that you follow the instructions listed on the bag.

review/summary: Good if your dog is constipated
review/text: I switched my two yorkies to Natural Balance (ultra premium) over a year ago and liked it.  However, I saw that this was a new product and one of my yorkies has allergies so I decided to give it a try.  Bad idea!  This food made my dogs poop uncontrollably.  Both of my dogs are house trained and have been for years, but this food made them poop inside and poop multiple times a day!  Unfortunately, I bought two bags of it (this flavor and another) and wanted to use it all.  I'm almost at the end of the second bag and can't wait to transition them to another food.  I don't know why it made them poop so much, but I would not recommend it to others.  Try Natural Balance ultra premium or another top rated dog food.

review/summary: Decent cake, great towel!
review/text: Kudos to the makers for coming up with VERY clever packaging - doesn't hurt that the cake mix is pretty tasty as well. I did jazz up the basic mix a bit by adding some spices and touches of my own (2nd time around) but the first time I just made it as directed and it was still delicious enough to be snapped up by friends and family.<br /><br />This is a lovely item to have on hand for a quick gift because once the cake is gone, the recipient will have a sturdy, attractive towel, adding a nice spot of color to the kitchen. You couldn't save this forever because the cake mix probably has a limited shelf life but if you regularly give gifts and want something to have on hand for those occasions, this would be perfect for someone just setting up house, newlyweds or people who don't have time to make something from scratch but still like to cook something that tastes pretty close to homemade, far better than what you'll find in the "cake mix" aisle.

This is more of a treat for me when I'm really home sick, and when I order them I tend to make them last and savor the flavor. German Deli has another brand that is pretty good, doesn't touch Karamalz though, and you can get 14 for roughly the same price if you're willing to settle for a lesser quality. I really wish it was easier to get in the States, because whenever I go home to germany I easily drink a crate of 20 in two weeks.
