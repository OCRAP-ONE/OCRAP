review/summary: Very Good Cooking Oils - Highly Recommended
review/text: This set of flavored "Mini Olive Oil" bottles is great to have on hand for most types of cooking, but particularly useful when preparing Mediterranean style dishes. These bottles may be small, but they do go a long way as it only takes a little to impart a lot of flavor.<br /><br />This set includes:<br />* Garlic Oil - this is very strong and fresh tasting, making it perfect for garlic bread or to season pasta just before serving<br />* Basil Oil - this is great added to lighter pasta dishes<br />* Lemon-Pepper Oil - this is somewhat more bitter than I expected, but that is easy to adjust for<br />* Roasted Chili Oil - this is my personal favorite for adding a little heat to almost any dish<br /><br />These are all good quality and taste completely natural, which is borne out by reading the the few ingredients listed on each bottle, just olive oil and the spices with nothing else added.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Not quite what I expected
review/text: I think if you want to try a few varieties of oils, or wanted to give it as a gift,  this might be an okay purchase. Otherwise, these bottles are tiny and are used up quickly, and thus I don't think are worth the price. I really wanted to try the lemon and garlic flavors. The lemon one was actually a lemon-pepper flavor, and not very good. The garlic was okay. I can't say  I cared too much for the basil or chili flavor. For the price, I should have just gotten a bigger, better bottle of lemon oil and garlic oil.

review/summary: My favorite lollipops of all time
review/text: I was really disappointed when the WalGreens and grocery stores around me stopped carrying these. They have been my favorite lollipops since I was about twelve years old.<br /><br />For those buying blind, let me just clarify once and for all: THESE LOLLIPOPS ARE FLAT! THEY ARE NOT ROUNDED LIKE A TOOTSIE POP OR A DUM-DUM.<br /><br />The actual hard candy part of the lollipop is a delicious granny smith apple flavor unlike any other candy out there, with a very satisfying, crisp tartness. On the outside, the Tootsie Roll company has slopped a generous spoonful of sweet caramel, and yes, this does tend to make the shape of the lollipop undulate a little bit. The shape of one pop isn't going to be consistent to the next.<br /><br />If that bothers you, well... I'll be honest, I find that a really weird thing to hold against a lollipop. Either way, the real draw here is the taste. These things are so good that, despite them not being available in my area anymore, I am willing to online and spend shipping & handling to get them. That should say something.

review/summary: Best Candy Ever
review/text: Caramel Apple Pops is simply the best candy ever created. The flavor is both sweet and tart and the flat shape makes each piece of candy truly unique. I buy these pops year-round. The only problem is that if you order them online- shipping is very expensive.<br />* These will melt (it has caramel on the outside), make sure if you are having them shipped that they pack the box according to the weather as most good shippers will do anyways.

review/summary: Mighty tasty
review/text: These are irregularly shaped sour green apple suckers, covered in delectable caramel.  In the past I have had similar suckers with a standard round shape, but these are kind of all over the place, making them look sort of homemade.  I like the odd shapes because then the caramel doesn't sit so evenly over the green apple, and I don't end up eating caramel followed by a sour apple pop.  I get a little sour poking through the sweet outer layer, and I still have some sweet there when I get to the inner sour.<br /><br />I really enjoy them, a good caramel apple sucker!

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I was standing in a hallway at my daughter's high school when one of the other parents handed me this sucker.  I loved it!  Within a couple of days, I went to the grocery store to buy a bag and they were out.  Drove to another grocery store and they were out.  Came home and ordered from Amazon (which I should have done from the beginning).<br /><br />These are basically melted Apple Jolly Ranchers coated in caramel.  Each one is oddly shaped due to the ingredients so they look a bit odd, but who cares when they taste this good?  The sweet and the tart mix together well for a wonderful flavor.  I also like them since they take a while to consume and when I am finished, I feel like I have satisfied my craving for sweets.<br /><br />I keep a couple in my purse now and have found myself handing them out to friends.  Most of whom have the same reaction I do --- great!

review/text: I ordered and tried this product as I am a lifelong Tootsie Pop fan. I had never tasted these pops as they have never been available at a store in my area. I was not disappointed as they are a great addition to the Tootsie Pop assortment. A little different, soft caramel outside and hard green apple candy inside. I have shared them with friends and now will have to order more. Thanks Tootsie Roll for continuing to increase and improve an already great product.

review/summary: The uneven caramel is done on purpose
review/text: I purchased the Caramel Apple Pops to share at my office.  They are delicious.  They look a little misshapen, but I realized after eating one that the uneven coating of caramel is so that you can get the caramel AND the apple flavors at the same time.  Think about it.  If the sucker were completely covered with caramel, you would not taste the apple candy until the caramel was gone.  I don't recommend biting through both parts of the candy to get the 2 flavors.  As it is, I must be careful about the caramel sticking to my teeth.  The manufacturer's  way of handling the dilemma looks messy, but is pure genius.

review/summary: Found these at local stores!!
review/text: Love these suckers. The caramel is delicious and the sour apple is nice and sour! For some reason, they've become harder to find in stores, but good news at least for Texans! They're available for two dollars and fifty cents a bag (20 suckers) at Brookshires and Walgreens (not online sadly). A couple of years ago, I found them at dollar stores and Big Lots. I've unsuccessfully checked around and even called around (gosh, I must be obsessed!) and Walmart, Costco's, Family Dollar, Dollar General and looked at the websites for those stores and these - Target, CVS, and Walgreens, Online, the only places you can buy these are candy retailers, Amazon and Costco Business.<br /><br />At the prices available at Amazon for 13 and up, those prices include shipping. That's ridiculous to say free shipping. These pops cost 13 cents retail at stores and nearly 30 cents on Amazon. They're making plenty off the price hike to cover shipping. It's shameful, really.

Also, these suckers are really just that good. Some people have commented that they're funny shapes and stuff like that... well they're supposed to be randomly shaped. That's the nature of the suckers. Each one is different. Each one has a different amount of caramel or apple sucker. Some are more caramel than apple sucker. Some are more apple sucker than caramel. That's just how they're made.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/text: Oh, Caramel Apple Pops, how I've missed you! I remember getting these as random gifts from my parents when I was a little girl, then suddenly one day... they just disappeared, and I died a little inside. When I came across these on amazon, I couldn't help buying an entire box all for myself! So glad I did, they're just as great as I remember.<br /><br />Reviews stating that their pops came warped or stuck to the wrapper -- that's normal. In fact, not only is that normal, it's great! These pops aren't supposed to come perfectly symmetrical, nor are they covered in a wax paper like your tootsie pops to prevent sticking of any kind. I've had a few where a bit of the plastic wrapper stuck to the caramel, but it's nothing a pair of nimble fingernails couldn't fix.<br /><br />These AREN'T supposed to be round balls either (They're not tootsie pops, nor are they blo pops). They're flat, ugly, asymmetrical, and sticky... but they taste frighteningly similar to a granny smith covered in caramel to me and that's why I enjoy these so much.<br /><br />I love them and my inner child adores me for buying them.

review/summary: taste is great, but inconsist apple/caramel proportion & shape
review/text: I agree with previous poster & was disappointed with the flat shape. Not only does each pop seem to be a random combination of hard apple candy/soft caramel (sometimes 50-50, sometimes 80-20), but they often have irritating rough edges. The inconsistency may even apply to the total weight/amount of candy for an individual pop. When you open the box, it looks like something went wrong with either the packaging or the manufacturing process.<br /><br />However, the taste is great... and addictive. Even while criticizing the design, it achieves something that would not be possible with a traditional 'hard-on-the-outside-chewy-on-the-inside Tootsie Pop shape: you get immediate taste sensation of Granny Smith apple and creamy caramel together,as they should be. I haven't found anything out there to compete with it.

review/summary: Odd but good!
review/text: This is my first experience with these suckers and I am ordering more.  They are very unusual and delicious.  They are a hard apple flavor sucker with caramel spread on top.  I would not really compare them to a caramel apple because with those, you get apple, caramel and peanuts in each bite.  With these, you get caramel and then the apple flavor.<br /><br />A couple things to keep in mind.  These are suckers you have to lick.  There's no chewing these and there's no putting them in your mouth and letting them melt.  If you leave them in your mouth for even a moment, the caramel sticks to your teeth and feels like it's going to pull out your fillings when you go to remove it.  The sucker will last longer than one you can chew, but you do have to work on the lollipop.  This isn't something you can enjoy while doing cross-stitch, for example.  You need one hand free to hold the stick at all times.<br /><br />Another thing - as you get down to the last little bit of sucker, it becomes sharp on the edges, so I would not advise giving these to children.  Lastly, because you do have to lick these from beginning to end, you are working on it for a while.  So the paper stick starts to fall apart right at the end.<br /><br />These small things aside, I would absolutely recommend these unusual but tasty suckers.  I certainly plan to buy more.

review/summary: Melted and disfigured
review/text: A review from 2010 reported the suckers arrived melted and disfigured, but since that was more than a year ago, I assumed whatever had caused the issue had been fixed. It has not. It's December 2011, it's cold where I live, and my box of suckers (intended to be stocking stuffers) also arrived melted and misshapen. Planning to order directly from the Tootsie Roll company, and hoping for better results.

review/summary: Too wide for my mouth, and I'm a big guy
review/text: First of all, I'm not a huge fan of the flavor - not bad, but nothing great either.<br /><br />The big problem, though, is that these aren't the kind of lollipops you can keep in your mouth. They're flat and wide, so they don't really fit in there. And I have a big mouth (literally and figuratively)! I'm 6'3", and my mouth size is proportional to the rest my body as far as I know. When I put these lollipops in my mouth, they are too wide to fit on one side (in the cheek, outside the teeth), and also too wide to fit in the middle (between the teeth). So you have to keep it in your hand, outside your mouth, and lick it like an ice cream cone. That's just a weird way to have to eat a lollipop.

review/text: I ordered this because it's vegetarian and I've been trying to find a good tomato flavored ramen (I used to buy Maruchan but they've discontinued it). I really should have tried to find it closer to me and tried one bowl of soup before buying a whole case, it tastes AWFUL! It's really bitter and doesn't taste at all like tomato to me. After initially trying it I let it sit for a while so the noodles could absorb the juice more and see if that tempered the bitterness, but they don't, it's unfixable.

review/summary: All three of my cat's rate it a BIG 10! 10! 10!
review/text: Simon, about 7 years old has some kind of adversity to most foods and throws up shortly after eating canned or dry cat food and nearly died from, can you believe, bronchitis? ...2 years ago. We have gone through many foods, dry and canned until I found Holistic Select canned cat food(He gets the Salmon or Ocean Fish). He loves it...and does NOT throw it up!!! ...even tho he only gets about 2-3 teaspoons morning and night and not a lot of dry, 2 x's day. He somehow still manages to weigh 14 pounds.<br /><br />Bella, a mostly gray with white chest and paws, about 10 years old would most likely fit within the widest part of a 16 oz soda bottle, in other words she is soooo skinny ...and might I mention FINICKY!  Her biggest nick name is Princess. She "cautiously" walks up to a new food I put down, sniff's it and IF she likes it, adjusts her sitting position, sometimes moving to a different angle before she slowwwly starts nibbling. She USUALLY does NOT like them and has this look on her face that says "You've GOT to be kidding me if you think I will EAAAAT THAAAAT!!!!! EWWWWWW!!!". She stands back up, shakes her paw and glances at me as she runs/hops off like a deer into the woods. Bella IS the reason I tried the Holistic Select. When I put the HS down for her, my eyes nearly popped out of my head. She QUITE eagerly, without hesitation or any adjustment to her seating spot or angle dove in as if she had not eaten in a week or more. She will only eat the Salmon or Ocean Fish. I have tried the Duck and the turkey and "no way!" I would so like for her to gain at least one pound! I think she still weighs about SIX pounds and eats as much as a fly. To make sure she is the only one eating her food, I bought her a bird cage "dining room". She is the only one of the three cats that fits thru the entrance.<br /><br />Then there's Bob, a brown tabby! What about Bob is what we always say. Bob doesn't run from much and eats more than he runs from. The least picky, doesn't throw up and is, like Simon about 7 years old. They're best buds, btw. (Bob also nearly died about 2 years ago from liver disease.) Usually, Bob quietly hangs out by his bowl near the stove, tripping us or getting stepped on. Knowing he is going to get HS, he has frequently becomes quite vocal in anticipation of his "Happy" meal.<br /><br />I, THE cats so recommend trying Holistic Select. Petco, when they kept it ON their shelves, sold it for $2.49 a can(even if you buy a case of it!). They said they did not sell enough for them to stock it and encouraged me to order it thru their website. I always have to "shop around" and found it on Amazon for $1.90 a can. I'm IN and Petco is losing OUT! (Initially, I would encourage buying a can, if you can find it at petco to see if your cat will eat it. They will order some for you but u have to check back &lt;they don't call you when it arrives!>, they just put it on the shelf and it disappears FAST). Once you know it's good to go, order online. If you do the Prime shipping thing on Amazon, most everything you buy is shipped free.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!<br />~Yvonne

Two other cats developed kidney problems later in life and needed additional fluids everyday.  I have tried a variety of cat foods, but this is their all time favorite. I like it because it is a Holistic Blend of great ingredients that the cats love. It has a soft, blended, wet consistency. I still give them Halo Dry food, a small amount each day.

review/text: Desperation led me to try this food although I wasn't crazy about the brewers dried yeast or potatoes. I needed to try something without fish in it for my kitties when 2 of my 3 cats started to get flaky skin from food that did contain fish. I found it quite a challenge to find a good food that doesn't include some type of seafood.  As this one did not, I reluctantly decided to give it a try.  All 3 cats seemed to enjoy it, but I will not be buying it again.  Even though the moisture is only the usual 78%, it is so mushy and just awful to work with.  My girls didn't seem to mind, but between the consistency, yeast and potatoes this just doesn't cut it for my cats.  I'll have to be satisfied with fewer foods in their rotation.

review/summary: Jolly Rancher Hard Candies, Wild Berry, 6.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)
review/text: ASIN B000F8L4GQ - Since I've just reviewed various listings for Jolly Rancher original flavors, I thought the Wild Berries assortment deserved a word or two as well.  Unlike the original flavors, Wild Berries seems to have only one listing, direct from Amazon.  This means two things: you don't have to look at a bunch of listings to try to figure out the best price and, if you'll spend a couple extra bucks, you can get free shipping.  Without free shipping, it;s really not worthwhile to buy these candies online.<br /><br />Usually, in packages of assorted flavors there's that one flavor that no one really wants.  It sits there, in the bottom of the bag, and one day it's all that's left.  That never happens with JR's Wild Berries.  It includes: wild strawberry, blue raspberry, mountain berry, strawberry-watermelon, and raspberry-lemonade.  Blue raspberry is the only re-run from the original assortment.  The one thing both packages have in common is fantastic, sharp flavor - literally mouth-watering, as real-tasting as candy flavors get.  With about 24 calories in each candy, how could you possibly go wrong?!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/summary: Long pepper may be the original caravan spice
review/text: When Columbus and Vasco de Gama sailed from Spain and Portugal in the late 1400s they were looking for sea trading routes to get "pepper" or spice.  Spice had been carried west on the caravans for centuries and it was expensive.  Since long pepper may be the original spice that supplied the name pepper (from Sanskrit) to round pepper and chili pepper I wanted to try it.<br /><br />The flavor is far milder than black pepper.  To get the same level of heat I had to use more than 5 times as much.  No problem once I learned that but I didn't expect it.<br /><br />There's far more to the flavor than the simple hot that I know from black pepper.  This stuff really is a spice in the sense of added a complex and rich flavor to food.  It's a pepper in the sense of adding hot, but think of the intense heat of horseradish and the mild heat of most mustard preparations.  In horseradish there are other flavors but the predominant feature is its type of heat.  In mustard there is some of the same type of heat (look out for Indian mustard oil or a mustard mixed from powder just before use) but most preparations have a lot more to their flavor than that.  Prepared mustard gets used as a condiment for that reason.  To think of black pepper versus long pepper think of horseradish versus prepared mustard.<br /><br />The flavor reminded me of Worcestershire sauce somehow.  It's not an accurate description of the subtle and rich flavor but it is the closest I can think of.  Okay, maybe more like the least distant I can think of.  Think of the difference between Worcestershire and soy sauce - It's the part of that is different.  I can tell it's somehow related to allspice as well as to black pepper, but it also has some sort of deep rich aromatic flavor of its own that I have not had in any other spice.  If you think cloves and allspice and cinnamon total two spices because of their overlapping flavors you'll like the fact that long pepper brings something new to the table.  The overlap with black pepper and allspice is not it's primary flavor.<br /><br />Because of the aromatic nature cooking it greatly reduces the amount of flavor it contributes.  If you want to put it in before cooking experiment some and you'll end up using it by the teaspoon.  If you want to use it sprinkled on the food just before serving it's a lot milder than black pepper so you'll end up using maybe 5-10 times as much as black pepper but less than teaspoon amounts.<br /><br />I bought it for the romantic history notions.  I use it because it's a nice spice that brings something different to the table.  Not an oh-wow-more-please experience, but it is delicious and a hey-this-is-different experience.

I just love having different kinds right there for me to chose which one. They packaged, Krackle, Mr. Goodbar, Hershey's Special `Dark, Hersey's milk chocolate, four total and I just tried all four and they were delicious, fresh and sweet and melty.  The only one thing is that it is more expensive here but it can be shipped free if you get to $25.00.. That is a deal if you cant get out to buy everything. Besides life is too short the sweat the small stuff.<br /><br />I am happy and I think you will be too.

review/text: These are pretty delicious, however the package feels like two fistfuls and the nibs run out fast! 4 oz is too small, it could be 6 oz for the price. Also tried other raw nibs with much greater value at 16 oz per package and also less sweet, more balanced natural taste. Wont buy again, because of those two things. Overall its a nice product, just a bit disappointed with price to value and sugar content.

The difference between sweetened and unsweetened is drastic.  No one in my home wants to eat them.  There is a no return policy on this product so I just spent $25 for five bags of un-edible product.

Also, make sure that the bean quality is #1 (not a problem with Jarblum products, but a concern with other Jamaican "blends" offered in stores and on the Internet). Thank heaven for the Blue Mountains (the "blum" in Jablum)!

review/text: I was not expecting this coffee to actually be shipped from Jamaica, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a FedEx International package at my door.  One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other "Jamaica grown" products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price.

The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it.

I can only figure the seller received the coffee as a gift and had no idea the cost.  I LOVE coffee and figured this would be very good but was so disappointed.  I wanted to see how much it would have cost me had I not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when I saw the going price on Amazon!!!!!!  There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.  I too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places, but not at this price... Needless to say unless I find another at a yard sale, I'll never drink this coffee again once my 16 ounces is gone... except if I take a trip to Jamaica mon.  :-)
