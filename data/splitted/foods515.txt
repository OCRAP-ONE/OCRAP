review/summary: Pleasant Surprise
review/text: I was not expecting to like these, but was surprised to discover I had absent-mindedly eaten almost half the container while working at my desk for a couple of hours after first opening the package. I took the container to the kitchen where it managed to last a few more days.<br /><br />These are an interesting variation on the traditional salted cashews. I would not buy them instead of traditional cashews, but would be happy to have them as an occasional change of pace. One star off because the onion leaves a mild aftertaste.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: These are still fattening and overpriced, but the sea salt and pepper keep the eating experience slow. Instead of munching on a whole can of fattening cashews without much flavor, you eat the nuts slowly. And they are very salty (and peppery as well). So they are still fattening but they are slowly fattening you for the feast.

review/summary: Zesty and Flavorful
review/text: As a health nut, there's nothing like picking up fresh food that's tasty and nutritious.  During breaks or on the run, Emerald's Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews are a zesty change from drab, empty-calorie snacks.<br /><br />Nutrition wise:  It adds a healthy dose of protein, iron, zinc, and good lipids (fats) to the nut mix.  For kids, it's a low-sugar alternative to everyday peanut butter.<br /><br />The designer canister fits snugly in your car beverage container, and the nifty lid is perfect for portion control. With four canisters and 10 oz. in each, you get about a month's worth of rewards--if you can control yourself.

review/summary: Pretty good.
review/text: These are a pretty good snack.  But, there's nothing extremely out of the ordinary.  After trying the cocoa covered almonds (simply delicious), I had high hopes for these babies.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. They are pretty good.  But, I had some jalapeno flavored peanuts a week or so ago that were delicious.  Black pepper while it gives these a little kick is not enough for a real spice lover.  It does kind of sneak up on you after you've had a few though.<br /><br />BTW, the nuts are also flavored with sugar, citric acid (adds a touch of tartness, I think) onion, "spice" and "natural flavor" in addition to the sea salt and black pepper.  You can definitely taste the sugar, onion and the citric acid (kind of a citrus twang- not a lot, just a hint)  That's something I would have liked to have known before purchasing.  But the taste that comes through is the sea salt and black pepper.  Actually quite a bit of black pepper. After trying them over again, I don't like them as much as at first.<br /><br />If you're looking for real cashew flavor with just a hint of spiciness, these are OK- not bad at all. But, not stellar either.<br /><br />BTW, the lid that is a serving size is a GREAT idea for those trying to control their snack portions, which is really hard to do with something as addictive as cashews.

review/text: I think these would have been better without the pepper -- or maybe just a little less pepper.  It creates a very overpowering taste.  I can only eat 2 or 3 at a time.<br /><br />The cashews themselves are soft and delicious.  The packaging is nice -- resealable and recyclable.<br /><br />So if you like salty nuts, you may like this.  I prefer my nuts lightly salted and with just a little pepper.

review/summary: A Gift for My Worst Enemy!
review/text: Ok, when you start screwing with the original delicious flavor of cashews, then you are experimenting randomly.  These do not taste good!  Plain and simple.  Pepper belongs on eggs only and NOT on cashews.  There is a tangy citrisy flavor that doesn't make it either.<br /><br />I honestly say, I tried a handful, husband tried a handful and we said, NO WAY!  The claim is SEA Salt, whatever that is;  I know I wouldn't drink sea water, so why would I like SEA Salt.  The cashews are hot and spicy and overall, the heavy seasonings take away the original flavor, and without original flavor you have something completely different.<br /><br />Cashews generally are a good source of snacks and these have no transfat which is good.  It's a good thing I have a few enemies in my lifetime, because they will deserve these!....Rizzo

review/summary: Nuts for these nuts!
review/text: I like nuts.<br />I eat pistachios and cashews and walnuts and pecans and macadamia nuts all of the time.<br />After all this time, I know what I like and what I don't.<br /><br />At first, these cashews didn't grab me.<br />Sure, they are a good quality nut and are crunchy and "fresh."<br />But the spicing was not something I was used to.  I usually like my nuts plain or lightly salted.  The seasoning here seemed a bit extreme.<br /><br />However, by the time I reached the "bottom of the barrel," these nuts had grown on me and I have to say they are pretty darn good.  The spicing really suits the cashews.  If you like salty, peppery nuts with a very strong onion aftertaste, then you will really enjoy this offering from Emerald. They also make some Cocoa Roasted Almonds that I just have to try.  But if you like your nuts fairly plain, I would steer clear of the strong flavor these nuts offer and instead get something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ELYHNG">Emerald Nuts Whole Cashews, 4.5-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Overall recommended if you are a little adventurous with your nuts.  :')

I know that is not nice of me to say, but these cashews are so phenomenally delicious, you will end up with an empty green pencil holder (one idea I had for what to do with the can after my can of nuts was empty because of my family eating all of the nuts) and just a fleeting memory of your incredible delicious Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews by Emerald.

review/summary: Cashews are very fresh, but much too salty, sea salt questionable
review/text: I'm a big fan of Emerald nuts, just check out my other reviews.  However, I was slightly disappointed in these cashews.  While they're very fresh, there was much too much seasoning, especially going overboard (haha, get it?) with the sea salt.  Furthermore, I question whether real sea salt was used, which typically has larger grain sizes than table salt.  It looks just like regular table salt.<br /><br />However, there is a saving grace for these nuts, and it prevented me from dishing out just 3 stars.  What to do with overly salty, peppery cashews?  Stir fry some chopped chicken breasts, and make Chinese chicken & cashews with bell peppers.  Don't bother adding salt to the chicken- just add in these cashews, and you're good to go!

review/summary: Pesky Little Prickly Pepper Picked for Palate Pop
review/text: I am writing this review fully acknowledging that tastes are matters of personal preference, whether in music or in food. That being said, I have to come out and say I just don't like these cashews, which are practically encrusted with salt and pepper.<br /><br />In our family we don't salt and pepper our food liberally, so maybe my wife and I were particularly sensitive to the salt-and-pepper blast of these cashews. Again, it's a matter of taste: if you love salt and pepper, you might like these.<br /><br />To write a fair review, I decided to wash the seasonings off the cashews under tap water to taste the bare nut underneath. I was surprised to find that the salt and pepper didn't just rinse off. Something was making it adhere to the cashews. So I soaked and rinsed and rubbed with my fingers a little more and finally got all the seasoning off the 5 or 6 cashews I had in my hand.<br /><br />Once I got all the seasoning off (or so I thought), I noticed something else that surprised me: the cashews were still greasy. This wasn't intended to be a whole-day affair, so I just popped two in my mouth. The first thing I noticed was that the cashew retained a slightly crisp, roasted character even after the drenching. That was the good news. Then I dropped the remaining cashews in my mouth, and a few seconds later came the bad news: I started tasting that pesky little prickly pepper picked for palate pop, poking its way through an otherwise tasty though plain roasted cashew.<br /><br />If you'd like a simpler review, my wife, a no-nonsense woman, ate just a couple and said, "I hate these. Do they have those Emerald almonds with the cocoa back in stock yet?"

review/summary: granulated onion and sugar + pepper = icky taste,  doesn't make any sense to call these "sea salt and pepper" flavor
review/text: I love cashews, was VERY hungry when I opened the container, and was ready to scarf down a handful of these!<br /><br />Unfortunately, they are nothing like "sea salt and pepper" flavor. This is one of those weird combos of ingredients that end up tasting very artificial.  In fact, the coating of sugar, granulated onion, and salt even has a strange texture that feels sort of plastic-y on the tongue and does not seem to dissolve.  The ingredient list is ridiculously long for a product marketed to appear simple and natural.  Why was all the artificial and processed junk added, when the basics of cashews, salt, and pepper could have been so tasty?<br /><br />If these had truly been as advertised I'm sure I would have eaten half the container. :)  Instead, I was only able to eat 3-4 nuts, then closed up the container.  When I find time I'll try rinsing them off with hot water in a colander so that they don't have to go to waste.<br /><br />On a positive note, the packaging is nice-- reseals easily and is convenient.

review/summary: Tasty Cashews Somewhere Under All That Seasoning!
review/text: I'm a big fan of Emerald nut products, especially their almonds, but I have to say I'm not nuts about Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews.  Cashews are generally tasty enough so all they need is a little roasting with a sprinkling of sea salt to heighten their flavor.  In this case, the poor cashews don't stand much of a chance against all the salt and, especially pepper--not to mention the granulated onion.  Where cashews are concerned, less would definitely be more!

review/summary: A peppery little bite!
review/text: I like salted cashews to begin with...and I just discovered that a good sprinkling of pepper makes them even better.  The taste is great. All that fruity sweetness in a cashew is brought out by the pepper. These nuts have plenty of salt and enough paper to leave the tiniest burn on the tongue.  The peppery flavor enhances the taste of the cashew and heat is just the right intensity. If you have an ultra-sensitve or immature palette and cannot abide anything spicy, you may want to give these a miss. But if like a little bite in your bite, you'll gobble these goodies down. Serve them with beer, alongside a sandwich plate, or tossed on top of any salad. They'll add a little crunch and terrific flavor.  I liked the Cocoa-poweder dusted almonds that Emerald recently introduced. They are subtle, unusual and delicate. These cashews, on the other hand, are bold...all that salt and pepper pack a lot of flavor into every nut.  The taste is so intense that one handful is very satisfying...good news for us who like to watch our calories.

review/summary: Charlie Cashew Sez: "I Coulda Been a Contender"
review/text: Like Marlon Brando in "On the Waterfront," these lovely cashews could have been a solid winner, if they had at least half the salt. Instead they remind me of the time I put a cup of salt into the cookie batch instead of sugar. There's quite a bit of pepper too, and it's nice if you like things peppery now and then, and most of us do.<br /><br />The best one can do is try to shake or paper towel some of the salt off (unfortunately this takes the pepper off as well) and sprinkle the nuts on a simple salad with just oil and vinegar for dressing, or perhaps nibble them along with some very plain veggies, like celery sticks. Serving size is listed as 1 oz. (1/4 cup) which gives you 160 calories, 4 grams of protein, and 270 mg of the dreaded sodium.<br /><br />Like other Emerald nuts that I have really liked, Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews would have been delicious and a 5 star item with much less salt, so they are a disappointment. Perhaps Emerald can change their recipe a little to give us "menos sal y mas pimienta." The sturdy container has many "post nut" uses, with a label that comes off easily, a lid that screws on tightly with ease, and a shape that fits the palm of your hand, as well as the cup holder in your car.

review/summary: Purchase only if you have more willpower than me
review/text: This is the easiest review I have ever written. I am in love with a nut (my spouse is too...and both of us really like these cashews).<br /><br />I like cashews plain or salted...I like salt & pepper potato chips. So I couldn't say no to this product when I saw it on Amazon (I have yet to see it in my local grocery which is probably a good thing). From the first taste, I really was in snack heaven. I very easily could have eaten the entire canister. They are lightly salted & lightly peppered with just a hint of onion. There is very little pepper-burn that some aggressive chips can have. If you stick to the serving size (difficult) they're only 120 calories. Fantastic.<br /><br />I don't give many five star reviews, there's always room for improvement. At 4.75 a canister, I guess these could be cheaper...but that's comparable to lower quality grocery store cashews & they taste much better.<br /><br />They're also available at a slightly higher price point (per ounce) in 2 oz. packs. If you DON'T have more will power than me, I would suggest buying them that way to avoid overindulgence...but who am I to talk? I'm having a little baggie of them for breakfast right now!

review/summary: Should Be Called Onion, Sea Salt, & Pepper Cashews
review/text: This is the second type of nuts that I have tried from Emerald with the other being the Cocoa Roast Almonds.  While the almonds were a sweet and salty snack, these are salty and spicy.  As with the Almonds, the lid measures a 1/4 cup serving of nuts.  After eating these for a few days, here are my impressions.<br /><br />As you can tell from the headline, these didn't turn out to be quite what I was expecting.  Granulated onion is listed on the ingredients along with "spices", but the onion flavor comes through rather strongly with the salt and the pepper.  While the taste grew on my pretty quickly, I found that these made me very thirsty.  Compared to the 25 mg of sodium in the Cocoa Roast Almonds, these cashews clock in at 270 mg.  The almonds also win with 210 mg of potassium versus only 140 mg in the cashews.<br /><br />In the end, though, the taste is what is going to make or break this product for most people.  What you need to know is that the flavor of these cashews is very strong, and it doesn't come from the cashews themselves.  If a strong salt, pepper, and onion flavor is what you are looking for in a snack, this will be right up your alley.  For me personally, they are something that I wouldn't turn down if someone offered them to me.  However, I probably won't go out of my way to buy more of them.  Finally as with all nuts you have to be disciplined because the serving size is small for the calories you get.

review/summary: Like cashews? Bet you can't eat just one!
review/text: Had only tasted a couple of these once before, and found them quite interesting. But if you're going to do a taste test the right way, you really need to get a canister of these for yourself: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ55ZO">Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashew, 10oz Canister</a>. Cashews are a personal favorite, and have been for years. Normally don't go in for anything but lightly salted or plain cashews, and personal preference over time has ruled out the dry roasted, chocolate covered or honey roasted varieties.<br /><br />That being said, expected that black pepper and cashews could go together but must say that these these turned out to be a surprising taste treat. The nuts were high quality and had a fresh taste which combined surprisingly well with the pepper and sea salt. These are only 160 calories per serving, which is the same as a handful of regular cashews. They are a good source of iron and zinc, and have no trans fat.<br /><br />Must also note that Emerald's "On the Go" canister" is an excellent variation from the standard packaging, featuring a handy lid that seems about right to measure a single portion.<br /><br />You can also get the same thing in a different packaging here: Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashew, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24).<br /><br />Ingredients: roasted cashews, sea salt, peanut oil, black pepper, others.<br /><br />Serving size: 1 ounce (about 1/4 cup)<br />Servings per container: 10<br />Calories per serving: 160<br />Calories from fat: 120<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br /><br />Pros: good sized cashews, lightly salted and a nice balance with the pepper, combined with an excellent natural buttery cashew taste. No trans fat.<br /><br />Cons: oil and sodium... but it's that sea salt that makes them great.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want some really flavorsome cashews, Emerald does a tremendous job with these. Will order more of them for sure...<br /><br />For those who prefer their cashews plain, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM2RVY">Emerald Nuts Cashew Halves & Pieces, 4.5-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 12)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ55YU">Emerald Nuts Whole Cashews, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)</a>, both of which have outstanding natural buttery cashew taste, and are packaged in the same or similar handy canisters.<br /><br />Warning: any of these can be habit-forming!

review/summary: Only if you really enjoy processed foods
review/text: I enjoy cashews and thought these would be a tasty variation. I eagerly bit into my first one and was replused by the oily taste. Since I always make my kids take 3 bites of everything, I kept chewing. It didn't get any better. Soon a salty taste mixed in with the oil, followed by the flavor of stale dimestore pepper - the kind grandmas keep in a tin in their cupboard for years because no one uses it. After completing the first tortureous bite, I ate 2 more nuts just to be sure they were not some acquired taste or novelty I may be missing out on. They were not. Took a good brushing and rinsing with Listerine to burn the flavor out of my mouth.<br /><br />I gave them 2 stars because I eat a lot of fresh foods and an above average amount of raw foods. Some one more used to a processed food flavor might find them more desirable than I did.

review/summary: Not just salt and pepper! Onion and Mystery Spice Too!
review/text: These are very strongly seasoned, with not only salt and pepper, but also sugar, granulated onion, citric acid, and mystery "spice." (I've uploaded a photo of the label above).<br /><br />I find them unpleasant for two reasons -- 1) they're just FAR too strongly seasoned and 2) I do not enjoy the pepper/onion/mystery-spice combination.  I can definitely taste the onion and citric acid (provides a bit of tartness), and cannot quite put my finger on the mystery spice.<br /><br />The nuts themselves are reasonably sized, most are whole or halves, with some broken pieces.  I've uploaded a photo above so you can see them.<br /><br />But ugh.  The taste is just not for me, and there is too much of it.  I think the rare person who really likes the salt/pepper/onion/mystery-spice flavor might enjoy these, as at least one reviewer has, but I'll pass in the future -- and I *LOVE* cashews in general.  The might be good to cook with, adding to a dish with no prior seasoning to add cashew and spice flavor!

review/text: I love cashews, and the idea of these yummy nuts with a dash of sea salt and pepper sounded inspired. However, the result is way too salty. If there was one-tenth the amount of salt, I might have tasted the pepper and -- even better -- the nuts.<br /><br />Another problem is the twist-on lid. It doesn't stay secure, which means the nuts are going to get stale, and maybe spill.

review/summary: Too salty, a little too oily and overpriced!
review/text: I found these cashews too salty and peppery for my taste. There is also a hint of onion flavor with some citric acid to give them a slightly sour taste. Some cashews were almost completely encrusted with coarse salt making them almost bitter in taste. I found it hard to have more than 2-3 cashews at one time. Combining a handful of these cashews with a cocktail is a sure way to get heartburn!<br /><br />The price is also on the higher side. I prefer the store branded lightly salted and far less oily tinned cashews you can get at any grocery store to these.

review/summary: Strong Kick Takes Away From Natural Taste of Cashews
review/text: Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews are advertised as an alternative to "plain old cashews".  And while the combination of salt and pepper create an interesting flavor and an almost elegant alternative to most snack junk food, I am a big fan of the natural taste of cashews and think this product is essential a "fix" to an unbroken staple of American snacks.<br /><br />If someone does not enjoy the natural taste of cashews, however, then this product does present a clear change and certainly an upgrade.  The salt and pepper combine for an irresistible, slightly hot combination that's hard to put down (if you have plenty to drink, of course).<br /><br />Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews come packaged in the kind of handy plastic cylinder with a sturdy lid that my grandma would wash and use to store sewing supplies.  Even more appealing is that the canister fits perfectly in a car's cup holder, and the lid is designed to hold exactly one 160 calories serving.

review/text: The new Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews are a bartender's best friend.  Every bar in town should have a dish of these prominently displayed for their customers to enjoy--and in return many cocktails will be served.  These cashews are not for the faint of heart.  I love salty snacks--especially those salt & sour potato chips--and cashews are my favorite nut, so I was very interested in trying Emerald's new brand.  The natural sea salt is great--but the "hint" of pepper is overpowering.  It was way too much seasoning for me.  Eat too many of these and you'll need a few cocktails or glasses of water.  I think I'll stick with my regular old tired boring cashews from now on.  But I'm sure some folks might really like the pepper seasoning--like bartenders looking to serve a lot of drinks.

review/summary: A strangely exotic treat that grows on you... but bring water!
review/text: Okay, it's almost impossible to screw up cashews.  So, that'll net three stars right there.  The idea behind these seasonings had me worried, though.  It was so obvious that someone must've been avoiding it for a reason.  After enjoying them, I'm not sure why this wasn't done a long time ago.  In short, the snack works.  I had seen the Emerald Robert Goulet ad and knew that the company was being run by mad geniuses, but I could never find the brand.  Until now.  A quick breakdown...<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />They really lay on the "sea salt."  And I find the idea of "sea salt" vaguely pretentious.  It all tastes like salt to this Philistine.  Anyway, there's a lot of it here.  Make sure you have cocktails (these go very well with martinis, gin & tonics, or scotch), sodas, or water to mitigate the mouth-puckering amount of salt.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />Great container... for one person.  Easily fits into a car or movie theater cup-holder.  (Of course, the squatter Planter's containers double as nut bowls, but then, they're useless on the go.)  If you're on your own, you can pretty much "drink" the snack out of the container.  If you just lick the seasonings off the nut before biting in, as a friend of mine did, you won't get a fair idea of why they're good.  The flavors -- salt, pepper, and the buttery cashew taste -- only work when you've chewed them together.  At that point, food chemistry takes over and the mix takes on a sophisticated zing.<br /><br />Overall, an oddball snack with an air of hoity-toity, cocktail-hour sophistication.  This is the eccentric, world-traveler uncle of snacks.  A wacky-yet-bland idea that works best after you've melded the flavors for a few bites.  And I commend Emerald on one other point.  Nuts are my favorite snack, and I tend to stick to the traditional brands -- Planter's, Diamond, Mauna Loa.  These were of an equal quality -- large, not broken into pieces (mostly), faintly sweet, and very fresh.<br /><br />PS --<br />Since writing this review, I found a similar product at World Market.  The Emerald brand is far superior.

The cashews are rather small and a bit broken up (which could have been from the shipping) although they seem to be of good quality.  The problem with this product, however, is that it goes way overboard on the salt and pepper spices.  They nuts are too salty and too peppery and just not very enjoyable.  And they get even more salty and more peppery, thus less pleasant, the further down the container you go.<br /><br />I love cashews, but these are ruined by the spices.

The canister itself is very convenient and wide enough to reach into for the snack without scraping your knuckles on a rough plastic rim.  The pepper flavor is significant, but not overpowering. A good balance.  However, I like salty snacks, but found this to be a little too salty, even at the risk of drowning out the flavor of the cashew.  If you like VERY salty, these are good, but if you like mildly salty, steer clear.  I can't even imagine how the ones on the bottom of the canister would taste.

review/summary: SALTY!
review/text: My first impression of these cashews was that they are very salty.  Sea salt has a stronger flavor than traditional salt and it comes through in spades in these.  So, those who don't like or want too much salt may not want to try these.  Also, true cashew lovers may not appreciate them since the salt and pepper seasoning *almost* overpowers the nuts.  That I said, after the initial startlement, I found I liked them very much.<br /><br />I don't usually care for cashews since they are softer than other nuts I prefer.  But the extra spicy aspect the pepper gives these (and I admit to loving salt) make them a nice change.  I needed a large glass of ice water, but I did enjoy eating them!  I would buy them again, though not in bulk as offered through Amazon.  They are too strong for regular snacking.  However, if they ever offer a mixed nut selection I wouldn't hesitate if these were included.  Recommended to those who like salty treats, and those looking for something different.

review/summary: Way too much pepper (and salt and sugar and onion, oh my!)
review/text: First off, let's start with the product description for these cashews that appears on the product page: "Lightly roasted with natural sea salt and a hint of pepper - Value added seasoning for the consumer who is tired of plain old cashews." From reading that description, one would assume that these cashews have "a hint of pepper." That is not the case. These cashews are LOADED with pepper. When I first opened the container and saw these nuts, it looked like someone had wet them and dredged them in black pepper. And believe me...You can taste the pepper; and it stays with you. Very, very spicy. Too much so for me. I also agree with other reviewers who have said the nuts are too salty. WAY too salty, with 270mg of sodium in a single 1 oz. serving. Now, back to the "value added seasoning" description...Nowhere in the product description does it mention that these nuts have SUGAR added to them. Sugar? With salt and pepper? Add that to the "granulated onion" that also appears on the list of ingredients and maybe you can understand what I mean when I say that there's just a bit too much going on here flavorwise. You can't even taste the nuts!! I love cashews. And I love seasoned cashews. But these just don't make the grade. I think my biggest complaint is definitely the amount of pepper that are on these. It's WAY more than a "hint." Stay away from these nuts unless you want to make your taste buds very, very angry and give yourself some major heartburn.

review/summary: Hold the pepper!
review/text: After trying Emerald's Sea Salt & Pepper cashews, my household reached a general consensus. We would rather NOT have pepper on our cashews. While there were varying levels of dislike throughout the house, nobody really liked them. My sister thought they were disgusting. My dad, who LOVES cashews, will hardly touch them. I thought they were alright, but they're not something I'd want to eat a lot of.<br /><br />The pepper definitely adds a zest to the cashews. Whether that's good or bad... I guess it depends on your personal preference. If you love nuts & cashews, and you're tired of the same old thing, I'd suggest giving them a try. While I'd rather pass on the pepper, I did like the fact that they used sea salt, which is better for you (nutritionally) than regular old salt.<br /><br />I cautiously recommend this product to anyone who likes a bold flavor.

review/summary: No improvement over the almonds...
review/text: After Emerald's disappointing cocoa-powder covered almonds, I expected these to be better. If anything, they're slightly worse.<br /><br />Pepper seems a complementary taste for cashews. But there's too much pepper, and way too much salt. They smother the cashew taste. Though the cashews are of good quality (off-brands can be Really Lousy), their texture isn't quite as crisp as I'd like. (Granted, cashews aren't particularly crisp to begin with.)<br /><br />The cannister is nice -- ergonomic and sturdy. I can see buying this product simply to get the cannister to hold plain nuts or other snacks. (Lead balls, too.)<br /><br />Most nuts are sold "plain", with only a bit of garnishment (salt or mild spices), and for a good reason -- nuts taste good by themselves. They don't need enhancement. If Diamond (the "synomymous with walnuts" company that makes Emerald products) is trying to enhance their profits by "enhancing" their products, they're not doing it very well. I'd rather have a can of Planter's, thank you.

Maybe it was just that he was eating too much at once?<br /><br />I did notice that he went back to the Archer Farms brand that I had in the pantry, so I don't know if he'll be finishing the Emerald brand or not.<br /><br />If anything changes, I'll update my review again.<br /><br />I like the fact that the lid fits securely and they seem to stay fresh for a long time.

review/summary: Maybe too much pepper, but a good flavorful snack
review/text: I think it's important to note that the "pepper" here is ground black pepper - not a spicy pepper like jalape&ntilde;os - something I didn't realize when I ordered these cashews.  But, no problem, I actually like black pepper.  And I think the combination works very well here, except that there's a bit too much pepper being used - the amount could probably be cut almost in half.  And the pepper is pretty strong, like freshly ground pepper, so it gives a good strong taste, but not so much that you don't taste the cashew.  I thought it kind of overwhelmed the flavor of the sea salt but as I shared some around the office others thought the product was a bit too salty (I'm something of a salt-aholic).  Nonetheless, everyone agreed that they're good enough to be slightly addicting.<br /><br />As with the other Emerald nuts, the cap makes a great measuring cup for a serving - if you can limit yourself to a single serving.  It's maybe not my first choice among the many excellent Emerald products, but a good snack for anyone who likes pepper.

Of course, maybe that's better than a snack you continuously pop into your mouth until you've devoured the entire container. Some may say that the salt and pepper overpower the nut flavor here. I disagree, though the heat from the pepper definitely lingers. I'm going to give a thumbs up on this tasty product, but with a strong warning that if you don't like things hot and spicy, you won't like these. There probably is a smidge more salt and pepper than necessary, the only reason I'm not giving it the full 5 stars, so perhaps Emerald could take note of that and lighten the amount just a bit.<br /><br />As for the nutritional information:<br /><br />Calories - 160 per serving (120 from Fat), Total Fat 13g (saturated fat 2.5g, trans fat 0, polyunsaturated fat 2.5g, monounsaturated fat 8g), Cholesterol 0mg, Sodium 270mg, Potassium 140mg, Total Carbohydrate 8g, Dietary Fiber 2g, Sugars 2g, Protein 4g, Calcium 2%, Iron 25%.<br /><br />Ingredients: Roasted Cashews (cashews, peanut and/or cottonseed oil), Sea Salt, Peanut Oil, Black Pepper, Maltodextrin, Sugar, Granulated Onion, Citric Acid, Spice, Natural Flavor.<br /><br />Allergy Info: This product is processed on equipment that also processes other tree nuts or peanuts.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: First of all, I'm a cashew lover, so I figured I'd like these nuts. What I didn't expect was how much I'd like the sea-salt pepper combo. There's a slight 'twang' after eating a handful of these, and they are great with a cold beer or soda. Each nut is big and bold, no little pieces in this jar. The packaging is great; good for taking along on trips. The twist lid is easy on and off. If you enjoy spice, go for these, the pepper does give a little extra kick.

review/text: If you're the kind of person who lets the waiter grind the pepper mill until he pulls a muscle.....these might be for you. If you're the kind of person who likes a little popcorn with their salt.....these might be for you. Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews are not for the faint of heart. This is a strongly seasoned snack. Lots of salt and lots of pepper. I really liked them, but I can see where they wouldn't be to some people's taste, and for God's sake! if you're on a sodium restricted diet, don't even be in the same room with these!

review/text: I was a little bit leery of trying out cashews with pepper on them, but I was very pleasantly suprised.  The black pepper complements the cashews well and kicks up the taste a notch.  As with all the Emerald canister products, the quality is excellent, the canister is fashioned to fit in a car cup holder and the top is a handy measuring cup for a serving. I really enjoyed them.

review/summary: Fantastic - but you'd better love pepper!
review/text: The combination of salt, pepper and cashew does work. I really wasn't sure what I was going to think of these but was intrigued at the idea of the pepper.  The first thing you taste is a lot of salt.  And then you taste a LOT of pepper, and I do mean a lot.  In fact, even though I love black pepper, my reaction to the first couple of nibbles was not very positive.  I put it aside and tried it again awhile later and found that the taste had "grown" on me.  I now can say honestly that I love these and could see myself choosing them over plain cashews on occasion.  My 10-year-old daughter, who likes spicy food but usually does not like a lot of black pepper, says these are "awesome."  I definitely would buy again.

review/summary: Perfectly peppery
review/text: These are very tasty cashews. My husband's quotes are..."Amazing", "bleep those are good" and "Can we get more?" I wasn't sure about sea salt and pepper on cashews, but I think it is a good combination, too. The pepper slows me down on how fast I eat these, which makes me enjoy the flavor and taste more. While not an issue for my family, this product contains maltodextrin, which is sometimes made from wheat. As we are fans of wasabi peas, we have previously tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V99IZI">Emerald Wasabi Bold Peanuts, 12-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 12)</a>, but we like this flavor much better. I will buy this product again.

review/summary: Less Really IS More
review/text: Given that Salt & Pepper is my favorite potato chip flavor (specifically Kettle Brand Krinkle Cut for those who might be interested) and I love cashews, I was looking forward to trying these. Alas, once again, Emerald has managed to just miss the mark.<br />I like only enough salt in my food to enhance the taste, and the fact of the matter is that cashews are flavorful enough that not a whole lot is necessary. These nuts--which are nice and crisp and unbroken, no problem there--could easily lose 75% of their added salt and they'd be great, especially given that the black pepper used is of pretty good quality and kinda kicks in after everything has been eaten...if you can refrain from gulping your beverage of choice to slake the salt-induced thirst, that is. There's also some onion powder added, which would be a good thing if it were only discernible. But it's not because of the salt.<br />The lion's share of the nutritional data peeled off when I opened the canister, so I'm not able to provide them (I think I can be forgiven for not rifling through the garbage). Cashews are relatively low in fat for nuts, but they're not a low-cal food by any stretch of the imagination, plus these are roasted in peanut oil as well. I personally think nuts, plain or flavored, are a great source of nutrition but only if I can actually taste them.<br />In my experience, the single ingredient most common to mass-produced foods is salt, which seems a shame to me, especially since its misuse is so unhealthful. It's a lot easier to add salt to a dish than remove it, so if you're interested in actually tasting your food (and I think even simple, inexpensive food should and can be wonderful), let the manufacturers know. This product could easily be delicious if whoever formulated it would put a bit more finesse into it.

review/text: HOLY GUACAMOLE!!!  Never thought I'd say this, but MAN I LOVE HAVIN' THESE NUTS IN MY MOUTH!!!  As if cashews weren't already perfect enough, the Emerald guys decided that "nope; they need to be better"!  They've gone and packed a whole bunch more flavor into an affordable can of already scrumpcious cashews.  I'll admit every now & again you'll get a cashew so salty that your face'll contort into one of those stupid salt overload kinda faces, but those are few & far between.  The pepper adds a great flavor & a little heat at the tip of your tongue, it's literally unlike anything I've tasted on a cashew before, AWESOME!!!  Seriously, it was like god touched my mouth while eating these suckers.  Oh well, he giveth & he taketh away.  In the time it's taken me to write this review half of my stash is gone :(.  If you're looking for something semi-healthy this is for you.  Pimp My Cashew Baby!!!<br /><br />Now if only we could get some Wasabi flavored cashews (Hint! Hint! Emerald)

review/text: I love cashews but wanted to get several different opinions so I brought this in to be enjoyed by all of my coworkers.<br /><br />It didn't last three minutes.<br /><br />Personally, I loved them.  The picture shows some cashews lightly covered in pepper but when you open this up there is no light covoring.  These things are three times as smothered in salt and pepper than the picture depicts.  The taste was fantastic!  It added a lot of flavor to cashews and brought them to an entire new level.  They do have an after-taste, but it is a good aftertaste so you can enjoy them longer than they last in your mouth.<br /><br />Now this is all opinion, but I hope you can trust this lover of cashews.  How quickly they disappeared amongst coworkers should be further testament to their tastiness.  One of them even hunted me down asking for more.<br /><br />If you love cashews, at least give these a shot.  I haven't found anybody yet who didn't enjoy them.

review/text: Found these by accident in the grocery store and fell in love. they aren't Planters but that is what makes them special. Yes,depending on the batch, the pepper can be a bit much, but that is a saving grace.  The spiciness limits intake to one serving (a capful) or you might end up eating the entire canister in one setting.  Talk about being "rich" for the system. My sister, who has no tolerance for spicy foods, actually loves them. She plans to add a couple cans to her Hurricane kit.<br />For the past month, I have not been able to find the nuts.  Knowing that Amazon has a supply is simply great and at a cheaper price (including shipping).  Needless to say, I will be ordering a "few" cans.

Unfortunately, I was hoping the problem was limited to only one container, so I opened them all, and they were all inedible.  I was very disappointed, so I cancelled my autoship. I see no reason to keep paying for something and you're rolling the dice on the quality.

review/text: I got a chance to taste these cashews at my trainer's house a couple of months ago. Normally I have much better manners than to finish off an entire can of snacks offered to me at someone's home, but these cashews were fantastic. They are large, creamy and buttery cashews sprinkled (okay showered) in a luscious coating of high quality sea salt and pepper. Definitely not a treat for "blander" palettes (unless you shake off the excess)...but for someone like me for whom there can never be too much pepper, these nuts are the holy grail of snacks. The excess coating is great to season seafood and makes a terrific cashew encrusted Tilapia...just yummy.

review/text: I love cashews and I love pepper. The first time I bought these I thought they were great. Then a friend gave a canister to me as a gift and they had tried Sea Salt& Pepper cashews and they were not sure they liked them. I was surprised by their comment and then tried some of the cashews from their canister and immediately noted that they were much saltier than the cashews I had tried previously. I later tried the cashews they had given me as a gift and those too were much too salty! I thought at that time maybe it was just a "bad batch". I had almost decided to not buy any more but then gave them one more try and once again found them delicious and not too salty! I have bought more since then and some are too salty and others are not! I plan on letting Emerald (Diamond Foods) know about the inconsistency because when they are not too salty they are REALLY good!!!<br />Update: 7/12/2012. Diamond Foods responded promptly to my complaint that the product is inconsistent by sending me a coupon for $5.99. But unfortunately the product continues to be very inconsistent. The last few packages I have bought have been way too salty--so sadly I will not purchase any more! Once again--if you are lucky enough to get a good package they are great!

review/summary: I do not like cashews, BUT I LOVE THESE!!
review/text: I was introduced to Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews on a recent fishing trip. Someone asked if I wanted some, and I declined... "Thanks, but I don't like cashews..." I was then encouraged to try these, because they were "amazing". So I did, and I agree! I could NOT stop eating these! Ordinarily, the only nut I like are peanuts. However, these were SO awesome that I recently found myself shelling out for them in the local grocery. I took them home to my wife, who was also skeptical, and she loved them as well.<br /><br />Here's the deal: if you are sensitive to or do not like things that are extra salty or peppery, DO NOT buy these. You won't like them. They are not "lightly" treated -- they are heavily salted and peppered, which is (in my opinion) what makes them so great. The salt/pepper does not bother me at all, but I still make sure to have something to drink nearby!<br /><br />These cashews were priced at like $5-6 in my local grocery per 10oz container, so they are not cheap. But the Amazon pricing on the 4-pack is a good deal, and I'll definitely be coming back for more in the future!

review/summary: An Excellent Breakfast Blend
review/text: Product:  Tetley British Blend<br /><br />Some quick terminology: a "Breakfast" tea is usually a blend of "black" teas that have been matured/fermented (until the leaves turn nearly black in color) to give an infusion that's a rich ruby color and an above-average caffine content.  Assam usually makes up the core of the blend. "English" style breakfast is a bit of a bastardized term that originally referred to a blend that was optimized for being brewed in soft water which, if you're fortunate (like I am) is the best for making tea ... soft means very pure, with negligable dissolved solids. As a general rule, if breweries like the water, it will make great tea.<br /><br />Ok, back to the Tetley.  My wife and I go through a lot of tea, and "Breakfast" style tea is our favorite.  Tetley's British Blend (henceforth "Tetley-BB") a very nice breakfast style blend that's also very convenient and economical.  The flow though bags are sturdy, fine woven, and infuse very well.  My only tiny nit is that if you're brewing a large pot requiring more than just one bag, you have to give it a brief stir to seperate the bags, or they'll tend to cling togethber and not infuse fully ... a problem not shared by pyramid bags.<br /><br />Flavor and appearance wise, the Tetley-BB brews up a bright ruby red, with good body, modest floral notes, good caffine, and a healthy tannic edge.  I like tannic tea, because I find it edgy and appetizing, rather than watery and insipid.  However, in this blend's case, the tea throws quite a bit of tannin ... enough to be noticeably staining, so you'll need to periodically scour your mugs, to remove tannin buildup.<br /><br />There are better teas out there, and plenty of comparable ones ("PG Tips" Pyramid Bags spring to mind) but in addition to good value, good and consistently bold floral flavor, and convenience, this one also offers relatively easy availability.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: I have looked long and hard for a great affordable everyday tea. Between us my wife and I drink about 2 1/2 to 3 liters of tea daily. This tea can be found for 4-5 cents per tea bag and holds more than other teas such as Lipton. For me a good tea should be able to sustain a long brew time to get the most flavor without an excessive tannin taste. I can brew the amount above for 5 1/2 minutes with only 3 teabags. 4 bags would suit others. We put the tea in an airpot and it tastes good all day. Just try that with Lipton "tea dust". It has been stocked in our local grocery stores over the last couple of years and I buy several boxes at a time. I bought 12 boxes from Amazon though because it was cheaper and tea keeps for months if not a year or more. I hope this tea catches on. Only 4 stars as there are other better tasting teas, such as Empress from Fairmont Hotels or a good pure Assam, but as noted this is a great economical everyday tea.

review/text: Some tea, ("herbal" teas), say they are different.  They are.  To my admittedly middle-class, (but striving to go upward!) tastes, herbal tea is awful.  "Regular", bagged American tea is not far behind, (but at least is palatable.)  I count myself very, very fortunate, though, to have sampled the delightful, tasty, wonderous delights of loose, pure Jasmine Tea, Fortum and Mason's delightful "Royal Blend Tea", F&M's "Queen Mary Tea", and the wonderous "English Blend" tea, put out by several manufacturers, including the now sadly deceased, (it was far too good a company to judge its wares 'defunct'), Jackson's of Picadilly.  ALL these "fancy" teas were wonderous, and wonderously different from the "ordinary" tea one usually finds on supermarket shelves.  Alas -- all these "extraordinary" teas had extra-ordinarily high prices -- which, sadly, keep on climbing.<br /><br />Tetley's British Blend Tea is a very happy medium!  Not quite as tasty as my favourite, pure Jasmine tea, Tetley's British Blend is still, wonderously, delightfully, and quite tastily, different and delicious!  It has a nice, full, rich flavoUr, as in NO (other?)supermarket tea I have ever found!  It is a "hidden treasure" in the supermarket -- and here in Amazon's grocery, as well.  I like to think of it like me -- a person of modest means who is working hard to try to find a way to enjoy the best things in life, for myself and those whom I love.  I would daresay that this "Tetley's British Blend Tea", (so neatly and conveniently placed into round, but otherwise, deceptively "ordinary" tea bags), is, indeed, "the tea of the American Dream"! : )<br /><br />To make the best tea, I've found that one should boil the water.  A lot.  THEN LET THE WATER RST FOR A FEW HOURS.  When the water is cold, let the water come to a boil again....but J U S T to a boil.<br />(If you lack the time for this, then just bring the water JUST to a boil the first time.)  Mmmmmm...absolutely first-rate!!!!<br /><br />P.S.:  I do hope that Amazon is able to sell this wonderous tea forever, and that the "only 3 left" does not betoken either Amazon's<br />slow sales on this (hidden!) treasure....or, (worse!) Tetley's decision not to manufacture it any more(!)?  If either is the case, and no more can be had by the usual channels, either on Amazon or in the supermarket.....watch Ebay....and watch the prices soar for the remaining boxes!<br /><br />Please keep making this tea, (Tetley), and selling this tea, (Amazon), forever!<br /><br />In the meantime, I'm going to end this review, and buy some right now!

I am convinced that the only reason the US prefers coffee is due to the poor quality of tea available here.

review/summary: This is what tea should taste like
review/text: I drink a lot of tea, usually 2-3 liters a day. Of all the teas I have tried, Tetley British Blend and Twinings English Breakfast are my two favorites. If I had to pick one tea, it would definitely be Tetley British Blend.<br /><br />If you like a strong but smooth tasting tea without bitterness or a twang, Tetley BB is a tea to try. The little round tea bags are great with no bleed through. It is good for hot/iced tea, sweet or unsweetened. To me, Tetley tea BB is the perfect tasting tea. It is what tea should taste like. In my opinion, you will not find a better quality everyday tea for the price.<br /><br />Also, one case of Twinings Breakfast Blend, 120 tea bags, is about the same price as one case of Tetley, which is 480 tea bags. So Tetley is by far the better deal.

I used to buy Stash and Yogi other nice lines of tea (pricier too!) but I am so in love with this, I will never buy another brand. I pray they don't stop making it. All other brands of tea now give me terrible heartburn. This one soothes my tummy and makes me a very happy woman :-) I typically purchase by the multiple boxes, such as at least 4-6 boxes at a time. I live in a very rural area and it's difficult to get out to "the store", meaning the ONE WalMart within 45 miles! LOL. Otherwise, I do all of my shopping for items like this online, which is much easier. Thanks, Tetley and thanks Amazon, for being there for me in a crunch when I was almost out of tea!

review/summary: A taste of home... but...
review/text: Tetley Tea by far is one of the better British Teas out there for those that do not wish to afford the expense of Twinnings. It is great to see that you can buy one of the biggest selling teas in the British Isles over here across the pond however for those that live close by to a Walmart, go and check their shelves first. Online it is $3.18 for 80 count, in my local store it is only $2.75 for 80 count and I dont have to subscribe to get a cheaper price and I dont have to wait for it to be delivered. I first missed all the good things from home but since Lays have started Salt and Vinegar "Crisps" and I can find Tetley Tea on the shelves of Walmart along with Chocolate Digestives, all I need now is to find a place that sells Crumpets and I will be in heaven.

review/summary: HARD TO FIND
review/text: I was thrilled when I saw Amazon sells this product.  It is very hard to find in my area so I purchased five boxes.  I live near the Canadian border and was raised in Canada so became used to British tea.  I normally drink Red Rose (Canadian) and have since I was a child.  Now it is so difficult going across the border to get the tea so I tried and finally found one that satisfied my taste in this Tetley product.  If you are a tea drinker I think this one is so full of flavor and so close to the Canadian Red Rose you will enjoy it as I do.<br /><br />I noticed Amazon also sells the Canadian Red Rose but they are out of it, when it returns I will order a full supply for myself. Or may even try crossing the border again to go shopping in Canada.

review/text: When I lived in England, I used to buy this type of Tetley tea. Of all the English teas, this was my favorite. English tea is strong and mellow, whereas American tea is weak and bitter. British Tetley was the best English tea. It is nothing like American Tetley tea. Completely different. Buying this British Tetley from Amazon is no more expensive than buying regular American tea at the grocery store, postage notwithstanding. I order case after case; never get tired of it. Serve it, after steeping it in fully boiled (not just heated or warmed) water, with milk and sugar, the English way!

review/summary: The best...conditionally...
review/text: So being from the U.S., I'm much more used to iced than hot and, honestly, that's how I prefer it, year round. I enjoy hot tea on occasion but at work I usually only have time to lug around a large lidded cup with room temp tea (I think I need not add the word "regretfully" there).<br /><br />As others point out, Lipton tea is lackluster at best. PG Tips is pretty easy to get over here now and usually isn't unreasonably priced. Yorkshire Gold may have an edge on PG in aroma and flavor, but only slightly - and it always costs more and has to be tracked down. I've seen Red Rose but have never tried it; ditto Twinings.<br /><br />What I can say is this: neither Lipton, Tips or YG ever lent themselves to enjoyable "cold brewed" tea - merely drinkable, sometimes barely, even for me, who is used to it. Which is why Lipton's big Cold Brew bags are doubly disappointing. They SHOULD make good cool/cold tea but don't. Neither do Tips or YG.<br /><br />Tetley, however, DOES.<br /><br />I had never seen Tetely until a month ago when the spouse couldn't find Tips and brought home Tetley in its colorfully glossy but subdued box. Opened it up...nice fragrance. What's this -- round bags vs pyramids or regular old squares? Intriguing. Sadly, I never got around to doing anything more with that first box than taking it to work, where it sat unused for about four weeks.<br /><br />It's very dry winter weather here right now so yesterday, mid-morning, I was parched. Dropped 2 Tetley rounds into the bottom of my 18 oz plastic cup, poured on frigid tap water and let it sit for awhile (don't be disgusted yet, hear me out). After maybe 20 minutes, I shook the cup, swirled it around and sipped. Wow! EXCELLENT flavor, even cool! Tips, YG nor Lipton Cold Brew had any flavor when I'd prepped them in just this fashion. Tetley cool wasn't just drinkable, but was enjoyable!<br /><br />I know this means of tea drinking is heresy if not sacrilege to many here, but the fact that Tetley gives so much flavor when made this way - whereas the other big brands don't - has to say a lot about its quality.<br />Now all I have to do is buy a second box for home and try it hot, with a side-by-side comparison against Tips. I'm suspecting Tetley will come out on top. Plus, it's cheaper off the shelf.

review/summary: A Great  Flavor Adventure! (but no price bargain)
review/text: These are absolutely great to eat!  The peanuts are unusually crisp and crunchy, and are delightfully spicy with the flavor of the hot red chili shards and (more exotic) Szechuan peppercorns which make your mouth tingle. The chunks of chili and little Szechuan peppercorns mixed with the peanuts are also crispy crunchy, and very potent.  I think the salt must be infused into the peanuts somehow, not sprinkled on, because I found no grains of salt.  The spices from a bag (after I sorted out the peanuts) weighed about 4 grams.<br /><br />My 5-star rating is based entirely on the product, not the price.  I can get these peanuts for $1.59/bag at an Asian grocery store here in Sacramento.  To send some to a friend as a gift using Amazon, with shipping costs I paid $17.92 which is $4.48/bag for four bags.<br /><br />If you want to try these peanuts, first see if you can find them in a local Asian market before you order from Amazon at the price I paid.

review/summary: Too expensive!
review/text: Such a ridiculous price for a 7.5 OZ pack of peanuts.<br />It's only $1.99 for a 3.88 OZ pack in Asian markets.
