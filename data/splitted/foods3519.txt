review/summary: Easy meal
review/text: This is a good product for a quick and tasty meal, and lends itself to amendments like hot pepper or olive oil. Just add a few crackers and a salad and voila. I was expecting mostly beans, but it's about 50/50 and the beef is in real chunks, not microscopic like in most chili. Needs a little salt, for my taste. I got this on "subscribe and save" and saved a little more, and having it delivered sure beats lugging it home from the store. I will definitely buy this again.

review/text: So tasty & not overpowering with the spices(re:  doesn't revisit you later).  With lots of large tender chunks of steak it's a hearty meal in a can.  Very disappointed that our Kroger stores no longer handle it but happy and surprised to find it at Amazon & cheaper too!

review/text: real chunks of beef - excellent flavor if you like medium spice - may have too many beans for some customers - enough red pepper and corn to be seen - It's the way I'd want to make chili if I had lots of preparation time.<br />I eat it straight - I know of folks who use it as a topping for nachos.

review/summary: They know beans, but........
review/text: I can't fault Campbell's for designing (engineering) a food product for the masses.  It's their job.  But taste is intrinsically subjective.  To me, there is a sweetness in the sauce that I don't really care for.  Were it not for this, I would give it better marks.  I am a down-home chili lover to be sure.  But taste is taste.  There are adequate other vegetables in this to fill the stomach for quite a while.  As to the calories etc., bring 'em on!  I'll never consider "low fat" in any food.  I'm evolving into a higher life form and I need all the calories I can get.  I have tried other Campbell's soups & stews and they are just OK.  But they could reduce the sweetness in this one for my taste.  Oh, well......

review/summary: Very good
review/text: Ordered 12 cans of this and it was gone very fast. The larger than normal cans were just right for a big eater such as myself. The chili was very good tasting, and loaded with chunks of tender meat. At least one piece of meat in every spoonful, and in some cases, 2. Never a single spoonful without a chunk of meat, and that tells you just how meaty it is. 8/10 I give it, because I have tasted better chili, but dont get me wrong, this stuff tasted just fine.

review/summary: Fresh, tasty, herbal/salt blend
review/text: Herbs de Provence can bring many dishes to life. Baked chicken and root veggies are a good place to start, for those who are not familiar with this herb mix. Then expand the horizons by searching all the wonderful online recipes. Winter is coming; it's time to enhance those savory stews and one-pot dishes --- to take the plain to the extraordinary.<br /><br />I personally like this French gray salt and herb combination because I don't like to overdo it with the herbs. I prefer a more subtle flavor. However, if you prefer more herbal punch, you may want to stick with purchasing the herbs alone, or make your own mix, which is quite easy to do. Otherwise, you will be fighting with the salt.<br /><br />If you need to watch your sodium intake, you need to know that this product is heavy on the salt --- and the crystals are very large, so it is easy to over salt your dish. You will be fine, if you make adjustments for salt required for your particular recipe. This is just something to consider, when ordering this combo product.<br /><br />I can attest to the freshness of this product.  Upon opening the glass jar, the fragrance was very potent and lovely. I also prefer having the herbs in a jar with a twist-on-lid.  This will help maintain freshness.<br /><br />All said, I highly recommend this product, with the reservations mentioned. These concerns are manageable. Just remember that this product is predominately salt, with herbs as the secondary enhancement, but the herbs won't go unnoticed.

review/summary: This box takes me back to my youth
review/text: My parents were never very religious, but they still celebrated Easter Sunday.  By celebrated I mean they gave us each a basket of candy in the morning and then we'd go out to eat for dinner.  Jesus, God, and the crucifixion were never discussed.<br /><br />They used to give us a variety of different chocolate Easter related products, like Cadbury Eggs, chocolate bunnies, and Peeps.  On the eve before Easter 1990 my parents gave me a box of 48 full sized Snickers bars.  It was purchased at Price Club (which became Costco) and was the same box supplied to convenience stores.<br /><br />After dinner I opened my box and had a bar each before I began playing what would become a marathon videogame session of Rambo for the Sega Master System.  My father sat down and watched me play.<br /><br />"Did you open your Easter box?"<br /><br />"Yeah, but I only had one."<br /><br />"Just one?"<br /><br />"It's not like I could eat them all tonight."<br /><br />He considered me for a minute and then said, "You know what, I bet you could eat them all tonight."<br /><br />After hemming and hawing with him for a couple of minutes he finally began to taunt us.  "What are you, a wimp?  Go ahead and start eating, do it!"<br /><br />My manhood was then challenged and he was getting angry.  I knew better than to poke the bear.<br /><br />The first 10 bars went down pretty well.  Since I knew I was in for the long haul I began pounding the candy bars with Diet Pepsi (hey, why waste calories?)  The combination of the massive amounts of sugar and caffeine made me loopy.  I paused my game and laid down for a bit.  My father yelled at me to keep going.<br /><br />The next couple of bars weren't so easy.  This challenge would be won by pacing.  I decide to eat no more than 5 or 6 Snickers bars an hour.  I must have polished off an entire case of the soda as well.  At midnight my father went to bed, but before he left he told me that I had better finish that box.  "Make the family proud!"<br /><br />I ate the last bar around 5:00 am.  My brother celebrated the victory with me and then we started waiting for my parents to get up.<br />The wait was broken almost two hours later.  Ever since the first couple of bars I had felt gross, but now I felt deathly ill.  At around 7:00 my stomach lurched and the urge to purge hit me like a truck.  I ran to the bathroom and lost all control.  I shot nougat, chocolate and peanuts everywhere.  I filled the sink and the toilet.  I was so loud that I woke up my parents.<br /><br />For a second I had imagined a triumphant victory where my father exclaimed that he was proud of me.  That image evaporated when he yelled, "You ate all of those things?  What are you an idiot?"<br /><br />Over the next couple of hours I evacuated half digested (and fully digested) Snickers bars from both ends.  If you melt a Snickers bar in the microwave you can get the same image as I saw...once again, from both ends.  After the first bout of vomiting my nose was bleeding from the small jagged peanuts that had flown out of it at 30 mph.  Luckily the nougat kept most of the blood from spraying all over the place.  It felt like I had wet cotton balls shoved up my nose and a serious case of stomach flu.  It seemed like I had an endless supply of material to spew forth, and after 48 bars I guess I did.  No one seemed to care that I was heaving all day - even my brother lost interest after an hour or two.<br /><br />By late afternoon everyone else was ready for dinner.  We all piled into the car and drove to a Chinese restaurant.  We had to pull over twice for me to chuck, once I didn't open the door fast enough.  I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />I remember placing the order for egg drop soup.  The next hour was spent in the bathroom.  By the time we got home though, I did manage to eat and keep down the soup.  It didn't taste very good and it was cold, but it stayed where it was supposed to.<br /><br />It was at least five years before I ate any chocolate at all - the smell made me gag, and almost 13 years before I risked eating a Snickers bar again.  I remember eating the thing and then waiting, but luckily nothing happened.  I no longer like the taste of Pepsi - that night converted me to Coke.<br /><br />So, yeah.  Buy the box.  Just don't eat them all in one sitting.

review/summary: Best Ramen Ever
review/text: Although, I understand that the Goreng part of the name means noodles without broth, I'll never stop calling this ramen (meaning noodles with broth). The Indomie products that I've tried (original, satay, and pedas) are all delicious. Make no mistake, not all oriental noodles do it for me. When our local Asian market ran out of Indomie, the owner told me to get a different brand that he promised I'd like better. I ended up throwing it out, because the taste was just awful. Indomie (original) however, has a mellow taste, with enough spice to keep you interested.  This Pedas variety in particular increases the heat for the spice-addicted of us, without killing the flavor of classic Indomie noodles. My suggestion? Try it and see if you're not addicted after the first bowl.

review/summary: Layers Of Mild To Moderate Heat & Flavor
review/text: Years ago, I used to love McCormick's Mexican Seasoning, perfect for tacos, casseroles, homemade tamales and enchiladas. It only came in tiny bottles, and I was hoping to find a larger size but with the same mild yet full flavor remembered.<br /><br />Never did find it in the last few years, but happened upon this blend, with mild ancho chili powder combined with the dehydrated garlic, onion, oregano, celery and bay I might normally add myself.  On a heat scale of 1 (very bland) to 10 (screaming hot scotch bonnet), I would rate this a 3, meaning kid safe and husband approved.<br /><br />Wonderful sprinkled over pork steaks, grilled chicken or steak and as general seasoning for the Mexican dishes mentioned above...you can always add some cayenne pepper or hot sauce, if you'd like a more medium (5) to hot hot hot (8-10) heat level.  Received this in fresh condition with at least a 9 month expiration date, something that's important for our smaller family. It's also about half the cost of those itty bitty glass bottles of the original seasoning used before.

It doesn't require much kneading and tastes like vanilla, a bit on the sweet side though.  If old (over a year), it will taste rancid and be a bit hard but can still be rolled out.  Wilton brand rolled fondant is gross tasting and not as soft and pliable.  Marshmellow fondant is more pasty tasting and gummier.

review/text: I recently purchased a box of these cookies at my local grocery store because I have to regulate my blood sugar, but sometimes I just need a sweet treat to satisfy my sweet tooth. I honestly thought these were going to taste like cardboard, but I was pleasantly surprised! They are very coconut-y, so if you love macaroons, you'll love these cookies.<br /><br />These cookies are slightly soft, but not chewy, and I don't feel deprived of "normal" cookies when I eat them. Best of all, my blood sugar doesn't go haywire after eating them! They use fructose rather than aspartame, so people who can't consume phenylalanine can eat these, unlike other low glycemic products.<br /><br />The serving size on the box is 4 cookies which is good because I usually feel like my sweet tooth is satisfied after just 2 cookies, and 4 cookies is a REAL treat!

review/text: I recently bought 2 packages of Bergin Pecans and my family immediately requested Pecan Pancakes for a full week.  They were fresh and oh so good!  I have also noticed that purchasing Bergin Pecans through Amazon is cheaper than purchasing pecans from my local markets.  The quality of these Pecans are excellent and I definitely got my money's worth in quantity. I absolutely recommend purchasing a bag or two of Bergin Pecans, they taste awesome!

review/summary: Tasty Cheese
review/text: We searched high and low in grocery and specialty stores for this fragrant and tasty imported cheese, which we have enjoyed for many years. Luckily it is available at Amazon. Sap Sago is a very hard cheese, which you grate and mix with butter; then spread on your favorite cracker. A little goes a LONG way!

review/text: I can't wait to get this! In the 70s-80s, we used to go to Germany quite often and always made sure we stocked up on "krauter kase" (sap sago). It's actually from Switzerland and for some reason has become really hard to find in German grocery stores. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. My favorite way to eat this is by dipping bread and butter into the grated cheese. Yum! (I'm going to surprise my sister! She'll be so happy!)

review/summary: So happy I made this purchase!
review/text: Living in the south, I was a little worried about ordering chocolate for Halloween.  I decided the Wonka Mix Up Halloween Bag would be a better option as we're still in the 80 degree weather range in October.  You get 2 bags, each containing 200 pieces of candy.  The candy is small, but filling.  I sampled some of the Nerds and Sweet Tarts and was happy to find everything was fresh and not stale.  One bag alone filled up our rather large candy bowl.  I'll probably put one bag out for our Halloween party and pass the other bag out the following night on Halloween.  I'm very satisfied with this purchase!

review/summary: Lots of sugar, limited variety
review/text: This should satisfy your (or your kids) sugar craving for a long time.  The biggest downside is the limited variety--Bottle Caps and Sweet Tarts come in a variety of random flavors, but the Nerds and Laffy Taffy are limited to two flavors each.  The Laffy Taffy comes only in Banana and Strawberry flavors and the Nerds comes only in Strawberry and Grape.  Not a problem for handing out at Halloween, but if your family's doing all the eating, the flavors may get old long before the candy runs out.<br /><br />Still, it's a lot of candy, and it's pretty much what I expected to get.  Not a bad buy.

review/text: Two huge bags of candy - one bag filled one of those tupperware shoe boxes overflowing.  Most of it was a little stale - the laffy taffy was harder than it ought to be, the sweet-tarts were softer etc.  But still it's a fair deal for a work candy jar or a party or halloween.  Seems to include all four types in equal measure - nerds (grape and strawberry) laffy taffy (mostly strawberry, some banana and a few cherry and apple) sweet tarts (assorted) and bottle caps (assorted).

review/summary: Very Good and hot! A lot more flavor subtlety that expected...
review/text: This is now one of my favorite ramens ever.  If you're looking to graduate from the stuff you find in the regular American supermarket and your tastebuds are adventurous, you could do a lot worse than this.  It tastes citrus-y, peppery with other notes underneath that round out the flavor so it's not just too 'bright' as some citrus-y foods are or too hot as some peppery foods can be.  It is definitely quite hot, however, so if you're not into hot food, think 3 times before trying this.  That said, you should know that it comes with three separate packets and you don't have to add all of them to the mix.  The main flavor packet is a must, but the pepper packet and the paste could be left out and you'd still have a meal, though not quite as delicious in my opinion.<br /><br />Tastes really good with added dried shitake mushrooms, dried shrimp and dried seaweed, all of which add bulk and absorb the flavors nicely.  This is a creamy ramen -- if you haven't had one of those before, this is definitely the one to start with... again, assuming you like things hot.

review/text: I love the shrimp flavor mama noodles, both in their original silver packeted incarnation, and in this creamy shrimp flavor golden packet. Before I tasted the creamy flavor I was skeptical that it would work- kind of like when someone makes a peanut-butter and cheese sandwich. I was amazed at how tasty they were though.<br /><br />Ny only complaint with this amazon offering is that it is way too expensive- you can buy this at a local chinese supermarket for less than $10, so the $30 pricetag is steep. I am not talking about chinatown in sanfransisco either- i get these for $9 in minneapolis in the middle mid west!

review/text: I thought these noddles seemed like an interesting buy. I love shrimp anything. It took awhile for the packages to arrive, and when they did I fixed a pack right away.<br /><br />I thought I was gonna burn my tongue off. I didn't see anything written in the product discription or title about "extremly spicy" I was only expecting what it said "Creamy shrimp flavor", how that translates to spicy I have no idea. If I had known it was spicy I wouldn't have bought it, now I have several packs of noodles I can't eat.<br /><br />This is a warning to anyone considering buying these, they are VERY hot and spicy. There really should be something in the discription forwarning this. This is why my rating is so low, for lack of warning.

review/summary: Vivier Grapeseed Oil: A Far Cry From What I'm Used To!
review/text: First of all, both tin's had dents in them (I left feedback on that).  Second, the tin says on the side under ingredients "May contain trace amounts of other tree nut oils", for for those that may have allergies- BEWARE!!<br /><br />I'll admit that this is only the second grapeseed oil I have bought.  However, compared with the one that I had been buying (Napa Valley Naturals Expeller Pressed), this is certainly a far cry!  It's a very light color, like vegetable oil, not green like "NVN".  The taste bland; the smell is almost rancid.  I can't tell the expiration date.  There's a small stamp on top that says "10:17", and underneath it "J.01.12".  Aside from a "B2B Space" website (in French), there is no official website to contact them.<br /><br />I planned on using it for cooking (mainly popcorn) because of the high smoke point.  Won't even do as a moisturizer; when it came in contact with fabric it left a rancid smell behind.  Thankfully both cans were a combined $13.68.  Had I paid the full price (basically double), I would say it's definitely not worth it! Needless to say, I won't be buying this again.  If you're going to use this for cooking, I suggest you try another brand!!

review/text: I follow a low-carb, low-sugar food plan but of course I get the sweet tooth every once in awhile.  This drink helps curb my sweet tooth and satisfies me without making me feel guilty.  If I want to indulge a little bit more, I use chocolate milk instead of regular to make it and it adds just a nice hint of richness to it.  I highly recommend this to everyone and anyone who asks me what I use for dessert and I truly think it is worth the money.  You get a nice big container that can easily last over a month depending on how often you drink this.  One reviewer commented on the price but if you look at it like this... you can easily spend $30 at Starbucks in one to two weeks.  Plus with Starbucks, you get extra calories.  So if you like coffee type drinks and want something sweet, this is your drink!

review/text: Ramune is the Japanese version Lemonade, and it is a really nice drink, if you can get the glass ball to move away from the opening without spraying yourself with your drink. If you have been sprayed once too often, but love the taste, perhaps you should try this candy.<br /><br />I am pretty addicted to the stuff, and eat them 3 or 4 at a time. I enjoy just letting them sit in my mouth with that fizzy taste. They really taste quite a lot like ramune should. Sucking on some ramune candy is nice way to pass time reading, actually. They are quite refreshing.<br /><br />These candies are not hard, and quite chewable for those who prefer that.<br /><br />For anyone looking for a candy that is not over-the-top sweet, give Ramune Soda Candy a shot. It is a nice candy and makes a great snack. Even the container looks like a ramune bottle.

review/summary: It's Ramune in candy pellet form!
review/text: Ramune is a popular Japanese soft drink that has a marble sealing the bottle. To open a Ramune, you have to use a special poptab to push the marble into the neck of the bottle. It's a fun drink, very popular with kids of all ages. Ramune comes in several different flavors, but the original flavor is very much like a Sprite or a 7-Up, in other words a very basic lemon-lime soda.<br /><br />Now, you can recreate that taste with Ramune candy. It comes packaged in a miniature plastic Ramune bottle and tastes remarkably like it's liquid counterpart.  If you love the taste of Ramune, it's a no-brainer that you'll also love this candy. It's high on my favorites list, especially for quick snacking when I don't want a heavy sugar overload. You get a cool fizzy sensation if you just let the candy dissolve on your tongue.<br /><br />Way fun, just like Ramune itself. Can be had for around 99 cents at any Asian market. Order online only if you have no other way to get ahold of this stuff.

review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: I got this for a friend that likes japanese candies. I myself have tried it, and it was a nice treat. First off, this fascinating ramune soda candy is in a small plastic bottle that is reminiscent of a ramune soda drink bottle(minus the marble and glass bottle), and it is about half the size of one as well. The candy is in the shape of pellets and sort of tastes like ramune, but the taste could also be similar to Smarties or Wonka Fun Dip candy sticks in pellet form. Nonetheless a great candy.

They are pressed candy powder that comes apart and dissolves when you chew it. The sweet, unique taste fills my mouth, and instantly I reach for another.<br />In the two minutes I've taken to type this review, they are now gone and I'm contemplating buying in bulk. They aren't fizzy at all, but they are delicious!

They were pretty easy to make and they tasted okay, but they were kind of hard - not soft like cinnamon rolls should be.

review/summary: Balanced flavor and fire
review/text: The Caribbean El Yucateco is a midway point between their regular habanero sauce and the hotter Salsa Kutbil-Ik -- the sauce smells spicy but a bit fruity when you open it up, but once it's on your tongue it tingles pleasantly. (disclaimer: I really like spicy food, so my "tingles pleasantly" may be "burns horribly" to some folks)  The sauce has a bit of onion powder and a rich flavor, and isn't too heavy on the vinegar since it uses a carrot base like Melinda's habanero sauces.  The piquant burning feeling lasted about 30 seconds if I took a drink of water and ate some tortilla chips to 2 minutes if I just let the flavor dwindle away normally.  This is good stuff; give it a try if you like your hot sauces flavorful instead of a pure capsaicin kick in the teeth.

review/text: I bought this pouch along with several other wet cat food brands to see which ones my 4 picky cats (who eat more dry food than wet) would like, and I have to say this one beats the others hands down.  Because it's real shredded chicken pieces in a small amount of liquid, my cats couldn't really tell the difference between this and regular chicken.  The one benefit this has over regular chicken is that it is a balanced diet that has all the nutrients adult cats need and is AAFCO approved.  Needless to say, it was gone within a minute or two.  I will need to try Weruva's other flavors and get more of the Pumpkin Lickin Chicken for my babies.

review/summary: Weruva Pumpkin Lickin Chicken pouched cat food
review/text: The cats do love this food and I feel good feeding it to them because it is high quality food.  Read the ingredients and you may forget you are looking at a pouch of cat food, no ambiguous contents like "poulty by-product meal" here.  My only caveat is the cost.  Yes, I know you pay more for good quality cat food but I have read that even a lower quality wet food is better for your cats than the best dry food any day.  I feed my cats wet food once daily and they have "grazing priviledges" with a bowl of high quality dry food (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1WE5O">Solid Gold Indigo Moon Holistic Cat Food</a>) that I typically have to fill once a day.  I may buy this once in a while as a treat but they seem to enjoy the less expensive leading brand just as much.

This food gets good reviews for being in pouches, but our cat really does not care for it. She is not finicky, but never got exited about it. She does like the liquid, but she ignores the food itself. Also, once she licks the juice and picks a little at the chicken the remaining chicken gets dry really fast and she never goes back to eat it.

review/text: 130 calories, 0 carb, 14g protein, 2g saturated fat (6g healthy fats), 30mg cholesterol. high in omega-3s, free of any preservatives or fillers. if healthy foods are what you're after and you're not afraid of deep sea fish, this tuna is a very good choice!<br /><br />if flavor and texture are what you're after, on the other hand... this tuna is still a great choice! this is the only olive-oil packed tuna i've tried so far, and i've liked it so much i've stayed put (i've heard good things about progresso's, which is similarly priced, and some brands that are out of my price range-- frankly, i just can't afford to fall in love with a $32 can of tuna...)<br /><br />the first thing you'll notice on opening a can of this tuna is that the contents smell *good* -- not rankly fishy, not oily, not acrid or stale. it's yellowfin, not albacore, and the flesh is pink and comes in thick, meaty layers, not watery bits and pieces the way some tunas often are packed. the texture is succulent-- moist without being watery and rich without being greasy. the flavor is good, too-- the tuna itself has a very satisfying meatiness to it, fine tuna flavor heightened with a bit of salt, and the olive oil gives a little green sweetness at the same time. it's the only tuna i've felt compelled to describe as "beautiful" right out of the can... also great in casseroles, on canapes, in tuna salad sandwiches, etc. it has a robust flavor that stands well on its own and also performs well alongside other ingredients.<br /><br />of course it's a good idea to keep an eye on the amount of fish you consume, particularly tuna, which has been documented as containing high levels of heavy metals in several studies. look up guidelines suggested by the Seafood Choices Alliance and the Environment Defense organization if you're unsure of what is generally regarded as safe for someone of your age and gender. That said, when you do consume tuna, it should be GOOD tuna. this is the canned tuna that i buy for myself, and i DO find it to be GOOD! i think you will, as well.<br /><br />dolphin-safe & wild-caught-- enjoy!

Don't break it up too much, just heat it through. Or just pile the tuna on a sandwich with a little mayo and some pickles on the side.<br /><br />I buy it by the case (much cheaper than in the Italian delis) and give it to people I really really like.

review/text: Take it from an Italian, this is the best tuna and so glad I found it at Amazon. Can't find it anywhere in Las Vegas. The family had this shipped from NY to us because it's worth it.<br /><br />Try it with pasta. Put some olive oil in a pan, sliced up garlic, red onions, and some tomato sauce. When the onion and garlic is translucent (don't let it burn), add a couple of tablespoons of sour cream, add the whole can of tuna (oil included), mix it all up and put it over your pasta...WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Update: I found out that this tuna comes from Thailand. I used to think it came from Italy. The caution here is mercury. There are no government controlled food inspections in Thailand as there are in the US, so you may be taking a chance with mercury poisoning. I'm very disappointed and will not order again...

review/text: I had heard that tuna packed in olive oil tastes better than any other type, but until recently I had never tried it.  I found this tuna at a bent & dent store, and bought 4 cans.  I wish I'd have bought more!  As soon as I opened the can, the smell was so good I just knew it would taste good as well.  It was far less "greasy" than tuna packed in vegetable oil.  I simply set it on paper towels for a while to get the excess oil off.  The texture was lovely, and the taste was just fabulous.  I thought I liked tuna before, but now I love it!  I could just eat the whole can of it with a fork and be perfectly happy.  It makes the absolutely best tuna salad I've ever made, and it's awesome simply plain on top of lettuce with a little dressing.<br />My only problem with it is that it is quite a bit more pricey than what I used to buy, but I will simply adjust, because it's worth it.

The Genova Tonno tuna packed in olive oil is excellent to cook with; it imparts its flavor throughout the dish you are preparing.  It is also very chunky not broken up like the tuna being canned nowadays.  I will be ordering another case soon and I very much recommend it.

review/summary: Best Darn Tunafish in all of Christendom. .  .
review/text: OK - I know it seems ridiculous to review tunafish online, but I'm currently working in montreal and there is NO canned tunafish that is as good as this brand. Sure they have olive oil and all sorts of tuna infused flavors like dill, peanut and sundried tomato, but even their Italian "gourmet" tunafish does not have the olive oil infused almost creaminess and texture of this tuna. I don't know what they do to this tunafish, but this is the best tunafish. Hats off to Chicken of the Sea. Better buy up before there's no more tuna in the ocean.

review/summary: over 50% damaged
review/text: This is very good tuna and I've purchased from them previously, but this time they get only 1 star as 16 of the 24 cans were dented, some looking as if they were beaten with a hammer. They were delivered via FedEx and the outer packaging itself is not damaged, so I can only surmise they packed up a bunch of dented cans not caring whether their customers get decent product or garbage. For $50, I don't want to have 2/3 of it away...

review/summary: Good tuna (not the best, but good) and a great value
review/text: This is not the best canned tuna I've had--that is sold by Ortiz and is more expensive.  I save that for special dishes.  This is what I use for tuna salad.  It is good, comparable to Cento tuna, and far superior to anything I can buy in my small-town grocery stores.  The 6-oz. can is a nice size and the pack of 24 cans is a superb value.

review/summary: You'll never go back to Star-Kist!
review/text: My Italian grandfather used to buy this brand by the case and give it to us for Christmas.  Essentially, I was raised on it.  Then he passed away and we couldn't find it in stores.  Now it's back and I'm in Heaven.  But beware!  Eat a can of this stuff and you will be hooked for life.  The is no Tuna but Tonno.  Accept no substitutes.

review/summary: This is what canned tuna is supposed to be!
review/text: I first bought Genova Tonno in olive oil a few years ago from an upscale market near our downtown apartment. It was on clearance for half price (&lt; $1 for 5 ounce can), so I picked up a couple cans. Wow! this tuna was the way I remembered it should be. Solid packed, moist, and not a floating mess of tuna bits you find now in those cheap Chicken of the Sea and Starkist products. I immediately bought out the remaining dozen cans, and was sad when I finished the last one.<br /><br />Since then we moved from the downtown, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it still at some of the Milwaukee area Pick N Save stores. It usually retails for about $1.90 and is rarely on sale. I think the last time I bought some, I saved a nickel a can. It doesn't matter, because I always know it'll be good. I can eat it plain, but a little mayo and I get two hearty sandwiches out it.<br /><br />So ignore the water canned stuff and buy this if you see it in your store or here on Amazon if you don't. You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Better than average
review/text: This is better than other canned tuna in olive oil. It's chunkier and tastier.  Especially good for the recipes in "The Mediterranean Prescription" by Dr. Angelo Acquista....a fantastic book & recipes for following a Mediterranean way of eating.

review/summary: incredible tuna - mix it (drained) with shredded apple!
review/text: Major Market decided to quit stocking this in their northern San Diego county stores.<br />Great.<br />Stater Brothers and Ralph's still carry it, though.
