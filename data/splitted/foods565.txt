review/text: I drank one of these at least once a day for 3 months, I  usually get sick from my coworkers on a monthly basis, but not while I was drinking these.  I recommend these to EVERYONE!  Very great taste, I would still be drinking these if they hadn't caused me to experience heart palpitations, bummer for me.  Maybe if I drink less :(

review/summary: 5 Calories, Extra Vitamins, Plenty of Flavor
review/text: The Crystal Light On The Go packages are terrific.  The Immunity Pomegranate Cherry is my personal favorite.  Not only is it an ideal way to keep you drinking water rather than soda, it also gives you that extra boost of vitamins.<br /><br />These packets are perfect of liter bottles.  There is no sugar in these packets so I've never had to worry about mold, after taste or cleaning.  Simply fill your bottle up again and you're ready to go.<br /><br />A great way to stay refreshed if you've been running or just working at the office. You won't be dissappointed unless you want to be.

review/summary: Avoid this product - It is unhealthy
review/text: This product contains aspartame. This is a toxin with over 90 known side effects. It has caused cancer in rats, though it's very difficult to know if it causes it in humans (because at one point we all consume aspartame and it's still a pretty new product). Aspartame is an alternative to sugar. It's an artificial sweetner. Companies use it instead of sugar so that they can cut down on the calories in a beverage. However, I'd rather have 35 grams of sugar in my system than the kind of agonies that aspartame brings. Don't get me wrong, if you consume it in moderation it's ok, but do NOT consume more than 1-2 packets of this per day. I had no idea the effects of this product until I began consuming it at my only thirst quenching beverage. It all but destroyed my bladder and gave me tons of headaches. Since getting of it, I feel a lot better in both areas. It's a shame, because these packets are incredibly delicious and there's really nothing else on the market that tastes as good.<br /><br />In my experience, I've found that the best alternative is Propel from Gatorade. It's low in calories (10 per bottle) and it only has 6 grams of sugar per 20 ounces. Propel Zero tastes terrible, so avoid it. But regular Propel is fantastic. Not as sweet as Crystal Light, but still good, and much better for you. It uses sucralose for its artificial sweetner, and I trust Gatorade to not go for a bad one (havent heard anything bad about it). Sobe Life water is disgusting, and regular Gatorade has way too much sugar. So if you're looking for something to drink on a regular basis, you can't go very wrong with Propel. Stay away from anything that has aspartame. It's a tough sell, because it really does taste good - but it's just not worth the health risks.

review/summary: Why not promote Crystal Light Pure???
review/text: To help me drink more water I used flavor crystals to make it more palatable. When I visited my doctor I was told I had high blood pressure. I asked why for 66 years my blood pressure was normal but now it was high and I needed 2 prescriptions. Doctor said that was normal. Since I like to research I found that the crystals I was using had Aspartame, one of the most dangerous artificial sweeteners. Side effects include headaches, anxiety, abdominal pain, nausea, heart palpitations, irritable bowel syndrome & high blood pressure. Acesulfame potassium is another artificial sweetener used in some Crystal Light varieties. This sweetener contains methylene chloride, which is a known carcinogen - long-term use of this carcinogen may cause cancer. Other side effects include nausea, headaches and impaired liver.<br /><br />I stopped using anything with Aspartame(threw out the prescriptions)and my blood pressure is now normal. The "Natural" crystal light is not really natural because it contains Aspartame(which I was told is also genetically modified). Crystal Light has a very good product called "Natural". It uses cane sugar (not GM sugar beet) & TRUVIA. This is a much better product and only a few calories more than the "Natural" which is not really natural. Aspartame is not natural. Many other synthetically sweetened products use Aspartame. You have to read all labels. It's better to eat smaller amounts of real food rather then more synthetically sweetened, GM frankenfood and avoid the side effects. What's the big deal in a few extra natural calories?

review/summary: Good coffee, low price
review/text: After the latest price increase for Starbucks whole bean coffee, and Costa Rican or Guatemalan decaf no longer available (at least, locally), I tried the Direct Decaf Dark Costa Rican 5 pound bags carried by Amazon. At less than $9.50 a pound (Starbucks was at least $5 more than that when it was available), it has turned out to be every bit as tasty as the high-priced version. When the opened bag is kept tightly sealed in the refrigerator, the flavor is just a good at the end of the bag as at the beginning. I am sold!

review/summary: Edges out the other two variations by a hair
review/text: This is the last of the three (elbows with four cheese, shells with aged wisconsin cheddar) that I tried, and I think it's better than the other two. In all, each variation is excellent, but this white cheddar sauce is excellent and has a very distinct flavor.<br /><br />My favorite addition to this is mushroom slices (or whole small mushrooms) seared in butter and garlic. After letting them pick up a golden brown in the frying pan, I douse them with vegetable broth, just to get the flavor stuck to the pan off it, and mix all that into the rotini and cheese sauce. Mmmmm.

review/summary: the best taste in mac and cheese
review/text: I used to tolerate eating the blue box of mac and cheese because my husband and son "liked" it.  One day I saw this and said you can eat your blue junk and I'll eat this nice healthy box.  That night changed their minds.  They ate all of my box and we threw the blue box out to the birds.  There is no brand out there, I mean no brand - that can come close to the taste and health benefits of this product.  I add a full cereal bowl of cooked organic frozen peas to the box to make the mac and cheese into a whole protein meal.  It's a very nice and easy way to get a complete meal.  This Amazon price is way lower than my grocery store.

review/summary: My favorite mac and cheese style product
review/text: Annie's is simply the best alternative to things like Velveeta and Kraft, etc. This product has no artificial ingredients whatsoever, it is over 70% organic, and it tastes delicious. Sodium levels are high as with any of these types of products but it doesn't taste like pure salt. The cheese package that comes with it is a generous portion and add some chicken or tuna to it and you have a full meal, just add a vegetable side. I personally like to throw a can of peas in mine and a can of chicken - very well balanced meal.

Plus, there are slips of paper between each slice, so you need not cut anything or worry about adhesions.

review/text: Cheesecake arrived within a week of ordering.  Packing was amazing, ice in the pack was still frozen, and so was the cheesecake. We let it thaw to room temperature.  It is delicious, creamy, crust is perfect...but for me personally, it is super-sweet.  Typical of my taste, I just don't like super sweet anything. So, if you have a love of cheesecake that really is 'New YorK' style and really love super-sweet, then this is perfect for you.  For those of us who love creamy cheesecake with a nice crust but are more reserved on the super-sweet, think twice.

review/text: This is a resubmittal of a previous review.  Originally, when I received my cheesecake I was very disappointed with the careless way it had been packaged and delivered - and I said so in my review.  I NOW say that if anybody ever says that Omaha Steakes doesn't care about their product feedback, do NOT believe it.  After submitting my original review, I was contacted by Mr. Sendgraff of Omaha Steaks who apologized for their poor packaging and inormed me that Omaha Steaks has a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all their products and, that he was refunding my entire purchase price, including shipping.  Even after I told him we had eaten the cheesecake, and it was really quite good, he insisted that my experience had not met their 100% satisfaction guarantee standards and my refund would stand.  I say, THANK YOU, Mr. Sendgraff, you are a credit to Omaha Steaks Customer Service and have restored my confidence completely.  I'm looking forward to my next purchase of an Omaha Steaks product.

"Classic Curry" from Spicy Nothings is perfect - the consistency, the taste, the spices, etc. Whenever my wife and I wanted good chicken curry, we'd end up driving 20 minutes and spending $30 at a nearby Indian restaurant...With this, however, cut up some chicken, cook it in a pan, add a bottle of "Classic Curry," let it simmer for 5 minutes, and you not only get a BETTER meal (and healthier), but you can easily feed 2-3 people for $10. Can't recommend it more highly.

review/summary: Best curry hands down
review/text: Found this gem at my local health food store. I had been looking for a bottled curry sauce that I can just throw onto some chicken and not have to make actual curry sauce myself. Tried out this sauce and I was blown away. It tastes amazing, and coats everything perfectly. It tastes like I spent hours perfecting the sauce when I literally just dumped it on there from a jar.<br /><br />This stuff is so good I made sure I got every drop of it out of the pan after cooking, and licked my plate clean. Then I told my family about it and sent them all a jar. I brought it into work as leftovers and had coworkers following me around just trying to find out what smelled so amazing. I'm not exaggerating at all.

review/summary: Classic Curry (Madras)
review/text: I am not East Indian, but I have enjoyed this cruisine all my life, and thats a long long time. Back in the 1970s we owned a restaurant in Cucamonga, California that served Indian food one night a week. The other nights we served American, Mexican, Greek, Spanish, and Arabic food. along with entertainment of that country. Having been taught by several of the best chefs of Indian food, (North and South), I know what it should taste like. This product is among the best you can find in a jar. I used to make it from scratch, but now I use this excellent product. Try it. you'll like it.

review/summary: She is a thing of beauty
review/text: After going through the Amazon checkout, I awaited my delivery of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese with great anticipation. In fact, as I waited, I became quite impatient and actually strangled a homeless man. It wasn't my finest hour, nor is it something I'm proud of. Regardless, I rather quickly descended into a life a crime and drug abuse. But soon, the UPS man delivered my order; I was ecstatic! I quickly made the macaroni & cheese, keeping strictly to the directions on the box. I did have a little trouble trying to get the packet of cheese out of the little, perforated hole out of which the macaroni is poured, but it only proved to be a temporary setback to my redemption. Upon completion of the meal, I fell into a pool of joy as the warm, cheesy elbow macaroni noodles slid down my throat and into my stomach. Suddenly, I found myself free from my drug addiction! I couldn't believe it; all my withdrawal symptoms disappeared quicker than Judy Winslow from "Family Matters." I then said to myself, "If this can do that for me, I wonder what other wrongs I can correct. I found the homeless man I had earlier killed and force fed the mac & cheese to him. Much to my surprise, he soon revived and thanked me for the meal, as that's all he had ever wanted. He later became a successful businessman, and has only the mac & cheese to thank for it. After fixing all the problems I had caused, I ate the last spoonful of mac & cheese. Not long after mastication, Publisher's Clearing House showed up to my front door with a check for $5 million! I attribute all my success in life from that day onward to the box of KRAFT MACARONI & CHEESE.<br /><br />At $60 a box, it is a bit pricey, but well worth it.

review/text: I grew up on Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. I still love it and now my daughter loves it, too. There are all sorts of fancy macaroni and cheese, but only the Kraft classic will do. It's not too runny and not too cheesy and not too gooey. I make it "lite," as per the directions on the side of the box, and it comes out healthier and I like it just as well.

review/summary: Daviola Note
review/text: Do not know what happened with the previous reviewer.  I found this product to be hot but not too hot.  According to the manufacturer, it has 10% habanero and the rest being regular crushed red and Ancho (for a little flavor).  Maybe the previous reviewer thought he was getting 100% Habanero - but the label says CLEARLY - Hot Habanero BLEND!  The manufacturer says that more than 10% Habanero became a health hazard for the packing process workers...  All in all, a quality product for a great price (dried habanero are $25 a lb and then you have to chop it).

review/summary: Made in China
review/text: I bought this ginger for my wife thinking it was probably made in Australia or in U.S.A. because the only factories listed in Ginger People's web site were in either Australia or California.  Therefore we were quite disappointed when we found out that it was made in China.  We could probably have bought it cheaper in the local Chinese grocery store.  We tried it and it was both very gingery and sugary.  All you could taste was a full month of sugar and it was so HOT.  The ginger also came in small cubes and they should call it candied ginger.  Some were quite tough.  In short, I was not very impressed with this product.  We could probably purchase better products in the local Whole Food.  We were also skeptical with it being Organic since it was made in China where the standard for "organic' can be substantially different that that of the States.

review/text: This ginger is excellent.  It is fresh and juicy and isn't stringy at all.  I don't cook w/ ginger, I just eat it straight from the box, so I can't comment on this particular brand's cooking quality.  The cubes are small and generously sweetened, I usually eat 5 or 6 at a time.<br /><br />My only gripe is that it's a little more mild than I prefer, but that's just a personal preference, I enjoy a very spicy ginger.  I was surprised this ginger turned out to be so mild because several other reviewers have remarked how hot it is.  If you're looking for a very spicy ginger, you might try another brand.

review/summary: Like ginger gumdrops.  Tasty but boring.
review/text: I like my crystallized ginger in the form of natural looking slices that are big and sort of chewy.  These are perfect little uniform cubical pieces that are more like ginger gumdrops than anything else.  It was impossible to tell that from the package illustration, so I'm rather disappointed, especially because crystallized ginger can be had for way less money.<br /><br />They are tasty, however.  This is a high quality product, just not in the form that I like best.

review/summary: THE best muesli ever. No kidding.
review/text: I'm extremely pleased to see Amazon offering this cereal. Alpen (No Sugar Added version) is the best muesli available in Britain. Believe me, I've tried most of them (British expat). And your American mueslis don't come anywhere close to the deliciousness of this. Swiss-style muesli in general is much easier to eat than traditional muesli - mainly due to the fact that it softens in milk much faster and it includes whey powder which makes it a little sweeter and creamier when you add milk. I've tried a few other brands of Swiss-style muesli and this one beats the lot. It has just the right amount of raisins and nuts in it. :-)<br />A perfect breakfast, can't wait to eat it again!

review/summary: Cereal was stale, expiration date almost invisible
review/text: Cereal with nuts and no preservatives can develop a rancid taste pretty quickly if it's not consumed before the "sell by" date.<br /><br />Unfortunately the order we received from Amazon was over two months past its expiration date, and it noticeably tasted stale.<br /><br />It took quite a while to find the sell-by date. The Alpen box is a very light tan color, and the date is printed in white on the box top. It's practically invisible. I had to angle it just right toward a light source in order to read it.<br /><br />Amazon does not accept returns of grocery items, which is a good policy, but they did give a prompt refund.<br /><br />Judging from the other reviews, I'm sure the cereal is excellent when it's fresh. We may try it again in the future.

I also enjoy the auto-ship with reduced product cost and no shipping on other products and I will go that route on this one as well.  My only regret is that multiple boxes need to be purchased at one time.  I would appreciate the option of being able to order a single box rather than 6 at a time since I am the only one who eats this cereal at our house.  Maybe I can convince my husband of this healthier option now that Amazon makes it affordable!!  Thank you Amazon, for your wide variety and excellent prices... and the auto-ship program!

review/summary: Healthy AND Delicious cereal
review/text: We've been buying Alpen for years as the closest product we've found to a Swedish whole grain museli we loved while visiting in Stockholm.  Very low sodium (15 mg), 6 gr dietary fiber, 7 gr protein, and 3 gr fat in 2/3 cup -- a half a cup serving is enough for me eaten as next described.  This has sliced almonds, hazelnuts and raisins and is absolutely super with any sort of yogurt (I prefer plain no fat, my husband likes low fat Yoplait fruit varieties), some skim milk and, if available, your favorite fruit -- fresh or canned.  Or, add some additional dried fruit; we like cranberries in the winter.  Best of all, Amazon's price with automatic shipping has been much cheaper than the grocery store (where it's about $5 a box and hard to find as well.)  We eat about 6 boxes a month as we have it most days.  Do try this!

review/summary: Tastes just like Raisin Bran cereal!!!
review/text: After reading the reviews, I was expecting this cereal to tastes like great Muesli and was I wrong.  It's just like Raisin Bran....where's all of the fruit and yummy taste? I should've been more careful before ordering this.  Now I have a whole caseload of this stuff.  Well, at least it's edible and not terrible for cereal, but it's not great for Muesli for sure.

review/text: The first time I gave this treat to my dog, she spent about six straight hours trying to get the treat out, and finally I took it away so she would leave it alone. It lasted this way for a couple of days before she finally won.

While he grew picky about certain canned foods (including another kitten food made by Science Diet, which he had seemed to like at first), he always licks his plate clean for the Baby Cat Instinctive. I guess it really is what cats instinctively prefer!

I even tried a pack of their soup. As a result, I use the "beef rub" or the "pork rub" almost every time I grill. The flavor is so good, you can't really use too much or too little. The price is good, the product is excellent.

review/summary: Excellent shampoo
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by this shampoo.  I've found many shampoos don't deliver on their promise to provide a clean clear scalp, while at the same time providing soft manageable hair, but this product delivered.<br /><br />The texture of the shampoo was very enjoyable, its thicker than most shampoos and creates a great lather.  Further the shampoo has a good scent, and won't leave you with a strong shampoo odor.  The overall odor of the shampoo is simple which is great for a guy.<br /><br />After using the shampoo for a short period of time I noticed that my scalp was increasingly clear of both dandruff, and other build up.  If you are a person that uses product in your hair, over time that build up can become very annoying, and this shampoo did a good job of clearing that up.  I have also suffered from having an itchy scalp at times, and this product worked better than other over the counter products that promise to relieve scalp problems.

review/summary: Excellent Men's Shampoo
review/text: This is an excellent men's shampoo that should be used once or twice a week to keep your scalp feeling great and moisturized. I wouldn't recommend using it everyday as zinc pyrithione may scour the scalp if used a lot. Think of it as an exfoliating treatment for your head.<br /><br />I have read reports that Zinc pyrithione may reduce hair shedding and I have read reports that excessive use may cause hair shedding. So my advice is to use it once or twice a week tops and you will notice an improvement in the feeling of your scalp and your hair will smell very nice. Used like this, it works fantastic.<br /><br />This shampoo seems a little more creamier than Head and Shoulders and your hair smells and feels better since this has other ingredients that H&S doesn't have {Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Tea Tree, Mint, Coconut Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil}.<br /><br />Overall, great men's shampoo and I highly recommend it.

review/summary: No better...no worse...than regular shampoo...for us, at least
review/text: First, to the efficacy of the product:<br />It leaves a filmy coating on our hands (and, we assume, other skin areas, including scalp) even after many rinsings...not a pleasant feeling...and yet, we do not notice any real difference in dandruff control. We used it every other day for a week.<br /><br />In addition, the scent is very strong...and some may find it unappealing.<br /><br />Finally, as at least one other reviewer has noted, the packaging does not hold up well in transit: our sample arrived in a padded yellow envelope via USPS and was leaking all over the place. We thought it was inadvertently damaged during shipping...and disposed of it; Amazon very nicely shipped another one out, but that, too arrived in a leaky mess. This time, we cleaned it off and proceeded to test it out, with the above results. So, if someone does order it online, just be aware that this might be an issue.<br /><br />So, overall, we cannot fully recommend "CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full" based on experience, but as with any product like this, it might produce better results for others, so it might be worth a try. Just be careful with the shipping, and maybe wait for a decent price for the first time around.

review/summary: Good dandruff control
review/text: The obvious goal of an anti-dandruff shampoo is to get rid of those white flakes. Everything else is secondary. This shampoo achieves that goal, and does so without unpleasant scent or unmanageable hair. In that way, this shampoo is superior to the organic tea tree oil shampoos available at higher prices. I used this shampoo several hours ago and asked my family to determine whether my hair had any peculiar scent associated with it. Believe me, my 8 year old son would be quite honest about any inappropriate smell. They uniformly said they could detect no smell whatsoever. My hair is clean and there are no flakes. So we're all done there and the product gets five stars.<br /><br />Packaging leaves something to be desired only in terms of shipping. On mine, the push-top lid was pushed somewhere along the way leading to leakage. Big deal...very little was lost and I rinsed the container after removing it from the packaging. I'd suggest a small adhesive sticker on the push-lid designed to keep the product closed until removed after shipping. That should solve the problem.

review/summary: Caused serious hair loss
review/text: My husband has used Head & Shoulders anti-dandruff shampoo for a good 15 years, so I thought it would be interesting to have him try this product. After a week, I asked him what he thought and, in his typically manly-man fashion, he shrugged. "It's OK, but I don't use it anymore," he said. After a bit of prodding and asking specific questions, I found out that he noticed a significant increase in the amount of hair in the shower drain after he washed his hair with this product. For this reason alone after three days he stopped using the product completely. He also commented that his hair didn't have that "clean hair smell" after shampooing.<br /><br />I will add that I purchased another CLEAR SCALP THERAPY product for my own use, and had absolutely the same problem -- a noticeable (seriously noticeable) amount of hair in the shower drain after shampooing. I don't know if this is a problem with all CLEAR products, but it has been with the two that we've tried.<br /><br />This will not be a product we will buy in the future, as we both found it causes serious loss of hair. I now have two full bottles of this product (one for men, one for women) and neither will be used again.

review/text: This new Clear line of shampoos appears to be Unilever's answer to Proctor and Gamble's successful Head and Shoulders line.<br /><br />Being a long time user of the latter all-in-one shampoo, I can say that this Clear for Men Scalp Therapy compares favorable to it.  This one has a slightly minty fresh scent that I like.  It also includes tea tree oil, which I love, however I wish it was stronger for that nice tingle it gives your scalp.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Conditioning:  This is not labeled an all-in-one shampoo but it seems to condition as well as my other all-in-one.  I often skip conditioner for my short hair and it is fine.<br />- Scent:  Fresh tea tree and mint scent.  The mint is barely there so you don't notice it unless it is mentioned.<br />- Tea tree oil: love this ingredient.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- Wish it had more tea tree oil.  Not getting that cool tingle and strong scent it can provide.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with this and will buy it if it is competitively priced.

review/summary: Clear Men Therapy: Strong & Full, and it works
review/text: We all know that washing hair with shampoo removes excess dirt, sweat, pool chlorine and oil, as well as other unwanted products from the hair and scalp. But removing dandruff and skin particles that build up in hair takes something a bit stronger and that where products like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007K449CE">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full</a> come in.<br /><br />The key active ingredient in this shampoo appears to be pyrithione zinc (1.0%), which is a formulation known to reduce shedding, and according to some sources, moderately promotes hair growth. I've used the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AGC">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint</a> before with very successful results, and earlier this year, that formulation became my daily shampoo. I also have a closely trimmed beard, and when dandruff occasionally shows up there, it's irritating.<br /><br />So where does this one fit in? Is it any better in controlling dandruff? Both of these shampoos appear to have the same general list of ingredients, but the key difference seems to be that the directions for the Cool Sport Mint version say; "for best results use daily." This Strong & Full version states that "for best results use at least twice a week or as directed by doctor."<br /><br />Personally I've settled into using the Cool Sport Mint variety as a regular daily shampoo, but supplement it with their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AIA">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Dry Scalp Hydration</a> a couple times a week, as it has the conditioner built in. This Strong & Full version is the one that I use for mostly afternoon and evening use when my hair has gotten wet from strenuous exercise or after cycling. Hair can really get wet and nasty after being out on a mountain bike for a couple of hours in the summer.<br /><br />We all have different hair and different needs, but if you do get occasional (or frequent) dandruff, all of these products will do the job, and their descriptive titles are pretty accurate. I'll list all three here so that you don't have to go digging or searching if you want to try them out:<br /><br />* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AGC">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint</a> - daily use<br />* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007K449CE">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full</a> - occasional use<br />* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AIA">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Dry Scalp Hydration</a> - has conditioner<br /><br />If I had any complaints at all it would be that there isn't enough of the tea tree ingredient in any of these. For anyone who has used a good shampoo with a decent concentration of tea tree, such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003U4F6FC">Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo</a>, you know how good that extra tingle can feel on the scalp. It also aids in dandruff control, but it's far more costly.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />I first received the Cool Sport Mint version as a Vine selection, tried it and liked it, so I moved on to try the others. Since then I've re-ordered the first one to replace my older daily shampoo, and as the other versions run out, will do the same with them. Can't recommend one over the other, as we all have different heads of hair, and what would work for one may not be as good for another. Again, none of these have enough tea tree for my liking, but that's a personal thing, and I guess it's what works best for each persons hair. In any case, this Strong & Full version is excellent and highly recommended, but so are the others.<br /><br />8/6/2012

review/summary: Good shampoo that does what it says...it gives you big hair!
review/text: The phrase "strong and full" is a big deceiving because the odor of this shampoo is quite mild, which I prefer. A little bit lathers into many suds so this bottle should last a long time. So, many washings from this bottle means an economic deal. It really cleans your hair well and even 24 hours later, after sleeping, my hair still feels quite clean and not greasy at all. For me (and this is a personal gripe), this shampoo does indeed give you full hair. Since I don't need my hair to stand up taller than it already does, I probably won't be using this shampoo much. If you have thinner hair and want your hair to appear bigger and fuller, this shampoo should do the trick.

This would be a red flag if I had paid for the product.<br /><br />For the price this is listed at I would recommend Head and Shoulders over Clear.

I personally believe it is more of the former than the latter.  I have used shampoo that wasn't designed for men and my hair didn't fall out of my head, although there was the risk that my head might smell like strawberries or kiwi melon.<br /><br />With that being said, this shampoo by Clear is a very pleasant smell.  The shampoo is made with a combination of tea tree, natural mint and ginseng.  Theses fragrances combined really promote an appealing aroma.  I would say that this allows for a bit more of a masculine scent (not that I have anything against strawberries or kiwi melon).  It is also designed as an anti-dandruff product, I don't have dandruff, didn't have it before this product and don't have it as I type this.  I guess it works.<br /><br />The shampoo itself looks like glue but works in very well into hair and suds up wonderfully.  My hair felt very clean and refreshed after using this product.  I believe it is the mint in the shampoo.  Oh and never fear, this product will not leave your scalp feeling like you rubbed Vicks vapor rub on your head.  I have used a hair product that had mint in it and that was the result.  This is not the case here.  Overall a great product that I could see myself using again.

review/summary: Helps Me Manage Hard to Tame Hair
review/text: After using H&S for many years I thought it was high time to try something else and see if I couldn't improve my current shampoo situation.  Clear Men Scalp Therapy sounded interesting so I figured "what the heck" !  You get almost 11 ounces in this bottle which is a bit less than my current brand.<br /><br />The bottle is easy to grasp and manage in the shower without becoming slippery from the water and opening is a breeze thanks to the push down lid.  I found that while the consistency of this shampoo seemed a bit thin to me, very little was actually needed to achieve a full head of suds and to clean my overly oily hair and scalp.<br /><br />After using Clear Men Scalp Therapy for 10 days I can happily report at least the same dandruff reducing results as I got my my mainstay Head and Shoulders. But since the shampoo is apparently more concentrated, I used less and it actually rinsed out faster.<br /><br />The shampoo left my hair feeling totally clean with no trace of any sort of residue other than the scent which is not overblown.  I am a bit surprised by other Amazon reviews stating it leaves a bad residue and has a very heavy scent. I wonder if perhaps the quality and type of the water has something to do with all of this? We have VERY hard water here by the way. I can honestly say it rinsed clean for me and I didn't smell like I had fallen into a vat of perfume.<br /><br />Also, it was immediately apparent that rather than standing straight up and sticking out at odd angles, my hair seemed very relaxed and symmetrical before combing.  I have NO idea why, but it does for me anyway.  If I can consistently find this brand at the same price I may seriously consider using it full time and retiring the old H&S once and for all.<br /><br />Everyone has different tastes and while I really LIKE this shampoo, others may not. As with everything, TRY one bottle and if you like it great, if not you are only out 6 bucks and can chalk it up to experience. As for me, I am pretty likely to purchase a few more bottle once this starts running out.

review/summary: OK dandruff shampoo
review/text: I used it and I'm not a man. It was OK but seemed it was Head&Shoulders just a different color. Had a nice fragance and my hair was fine after using it.  It had a little more conditioner I think but it did work for the scaly scalp though.<br /><br />It was in a nice plastic bottle that looked good in the shower rack and it's a large too. Can't say it was much different that what the dh was using but he said he worked fine for him too. I didn't do a price comparison but after seeing it at the store I think it might have been a little less than H&S.<br /><br />Give it a chance if you find it on sale is my recommendation.

review/summary: Works Well. Light Scent.
review/text: This Clear AntiDandruff shampoo works well & has a light, non-offensive scent.  The bottle says that it should be used at least 2x/wk, but my family members use it daily.<br /><br />Overall, the men in my family like this shampoo.  One member prefers the 2/1 product because it is just "easier in the shower" & the other one prefers <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AGC">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>.<br /><br />However, fragrance & shampoo/conditioner combos are a matter of preference, so if you are mainly looking for an antidandruff & like the idea of the bio nutrium 10 products, you won't be disappointed with the results of this Clear blend.
