review/text: This is the best drink I've ever drunk in my life. The only problem I have with this is the product hasn't been given the "go-ahead" to be sold worldwide by the Pepsi Company.<br /><br />I don't know if I'd get the pear version of this product, but I would definitely get an IZZE for a drink after all my chores be done or any other time that I can relax and enjoy myself.

review/summary: Sweet Love = Great Coffee
review/text: After trying this coffee a few months ago from my local Sprouts Market, I was hooked! I am a serious coffee connoisseur and this by far has the most smoothest taste around. It's not oily like a Starbucks and doesn't become bitter once the bag is opened like Peets and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf coffees. It is a darker roast coffee, but I prefer those. Made with a few tablespoons (once ground) and spring water, you've got yourself one good cup of coffee. So glad to have found this on Amazon for such a great price. I will definitely be buying this again!

review/summary: Bogus Reviews?
review/text: The Snack Shop could not fulfill our order and provided two phony excuses that appear in other reviews:  1) that the product could not be tracked because it was shipped via the USPS; and 2) that it was "undeliverable."  Both of these excuses are false.  The USPS has tracking services for all product shipments, including the $25 2-day shipping I paid for.  And the USPS has been delivering to our address for three years without fail.  What the Snack Shop doesn't know is that we work from home and there was never even an attempt to deliver this shipment despite their e-mail stating, "the item has been shipped."  It also appears that many of these 5/5 reviews are very short, just the type that paid reviewers might file if they were paid by the number of reviews.  Thanks to Amazon's Customer Service for resolving this dispute and getting our money refunded.  They ought to bar this vendor from the Amazon Market as their phony excuses look like a pattern.

Finally I decided to try Amazon, and now I'm having it automatically delivered by the case once a month for no more than I had been paying locally (at WalMart). This soup has everying I like: a very light cream of tomato base, chicken and a mix of cheese, vegatables and spices that make it the best tasting soup I've found. Try it, you'll like it!

review/summary: Diabetic Friendly + Tastes GREAT + Versatile for Cooking/Baking
review/text: I'm a type 2 diabetic and this is one of the very few canned soups I'll eat. I take half the can and add steamed broccoli or cauliflower to make it more of a meal. I've also used it to make a mexican chicken casserole. I just layer low carb tortillas, baked, diced boneless chicken, the soup mixed with a "sofrito" kind of mixture consisting of chopped peppers, onion, fresh mushrooms and usually chopped broccoli - saute in a bit of olive oil and add to the soup and on top I put shredded pepper jack cheese or sometimes some store bought already shredded Mexican cheese.<br /><br />At the time of this writing, price Amazon offers for this soup is comparable to Walmart + they'll deliver it right to your door for FREE!<br /><br />The only downside to this soup and the only thing that keeps me from eating it every day is the sodium content. There are 890mg of sodium per serving and 2 servings of soup per can so if you ate the entire can of soup in one sitting that would be a whopping 1780mg of sodium for one meal! I don't have high blood pressure or anything but I do watch my salt intake.<br /><br />If they could figure out a way to reduce the sodium of this soup, it would be perfect and I would eat it probably daily because it tastes so good and is fairly low in carbs.<br /><br />Despite the sodium content, I'm going to keep buying this soup. The addition of more veggies cuts the saltiness enough for me and it makes a quick, low carb meal.

review/summary: Great lower carb soup and wonderful sauce
review/text: As the first reviewer said, this soup disappeared from the markets I shop here in the east, so, per usual, I searched Amazon.  This soup is outstanding on its own, and for low carbers/diabetics, it is a special treat. I use this mostly as a sauce for chicken, pork chops, veggies. I treat it like mushroom soup for a sauce, thinning with cream or broth if needed, which normally I don't.  It has just a bit of spiciness to it, and for me it makes a big difference in ease of prep and added variety to what are sometimes bland dishes. There are few canned soups I like, but Progresso makes the ones I find palatable. The French Onion is especially delicious and good for saucing.

review/summary: BEST KIND OF OIL WITH THE MOST IMPRESSIVE CREDENTIALS
review/text: IN A NUTSHELL: Recently I have begun using this brand exclusively. Here's why.<br /><br />"COLAVITA - EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL" has an impressive list of credentials that clearly set it apart from other makers of Olive Oil. This particular product boasts the following:<br /><br />-----*- Certification from the "I.S.O." - "International Standardization Organization"<br /><br />-----*- "Certified Authentic Product of Italy", where the best olives for olive oil are grown under the best conditions<br /><br />-----*- Natural product, just olive oil - nothing added<br /><br />-----*- Excellent full-bodied taste<br /><br />What are the nutritional components?<br /><br />A tablespoon of olive oil contains 120 calories, 14 grams of fat, and no cholesterol. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the fat in olive oil is monounsaturated and nine percent (9%) is polyunsaturated fat; fourteen percent (14%) is vegetable-derived saturated fat. Virgin olive oils also contain the antioxidants beta-carotene and Vitamin E, as well as the phenolic compounds tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol.<br /><br />WHAT EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE IS USED FOR:<br /><br />That being said, this is not an oil for cooking, as it has a very low smoke point. It is excellent for salads and for marinating and boasts a pretty low acid level. For cooking try their "Extra Light" product as it has a much higher smoke point.<br /><br />HEALTH BENEFITS:<br /><br />PROVEN PROTECTION AGAINST ATHEROSCLEROSIS:<br /><br />Eating foods high in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) [found in Olive, canola & flaxseed oil] will increase the blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids. ALA has been shown to confer a large measure of protection against atherosclerosis. As part of the "Mediterranean" diet, researchers used products high in ALA, and found that the ALA reduced the risk of dying from heart disease by 70% over the first 27 months.<br /><br />Canola and Peanut oil also contain large amounts of ALA and are similarly cardio-protective. The presence of a larger proportion of "mono-saturated fats" is central to the cardio-protective properties of the oil.<br /><br />-----*- NO Cholesterol -- -*- No Trans-Fat<br /><br />WHICH SIZE IS BEST FOR YOU?<br /><br />This and most of their conventional oils are available at most groceries and this exact product sells for about $7.00 for 17 ounces [.5 liter]. Bear in mind, that Olive Oil will become rancid if you store it for prolonged periods. You can, however, extend this period by keeping the oil in a cool and dry place, preferably dark. Also, don't buy the largest containers unless you can finish them within 1-2 months. Stored correctly, Olive Oil will stay fresh for up to 2 years. Smaller containers like this 17-ounce bottle may be more costly per volume than the gallon, but the oil will be fresh when you use it and that is ultimately what its all about.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY.]

review/summary: The Only Olive Oil We Buy
review/text: We have used Colavita olive oil now for many years and have always found it to be an excellent oil for use in cooking and on salads. It has an nice flavor and is far superior to other oils we have tried in the past. I am looking at a partially used bottle as I write this review; I will also add we have a new unopened bottle in the pantry in reserve.<br /><br />Colavita Olive Oil is made in Italy by the Colavita family who has shipped this product to the USA for nearly 30 years according to the label. The label provides additional important information about this olive oil in that it is extra virgin and first cold pressed.<br /><br />I have read in a number of publications that these qualities are important when one is selecting an olive oil. My wife is our nutritional expert and always specifies this brand of olive oil only.<br /><br />As a husband and consumer of salads and various other assorted foods which benefit from olive oil I can testify that it has a great flavor as far as olive oils go.

review/summary: Does the Job
review/text: QUALITY<br />In my opinion, having used a dozen or so brands of olive oil, Colavita is simply the best reasonably priced olive oil which is widely available.  I've been using Colavita for several years now, and have never been dissappointed.  Colavita is excellent quality, dependable, and reasonably priced---the perfect combination for a daily general purpose olive oil.<br /><br />FLAVOR<br />Although not an "olive oil gourmand", I'd describe Colavita as "rich and smooth".  Connoisseurs probably have other silly terms for the flavor, such as "nutty" or "fruity" (but a "civilian" would never describe the flavor as nutty or fruity). It is not  spicy like Whole Foods 360, and NOT strongly "olive-oily" (i.e., "herby").  Colavita is an evoo ("extra virgin olive oil"---to us non-olive oil snobs), which means "first pressing".  Most olive-oil nuts consider the words "extra virgin" to be sacred.  Practically speaking though, the mere label "extra virgin" is not a guarantee of quality---most grocery store brands (evoo or not) are harsh and bitter, but some are good cooking oils.<br /><br />PREMIUM OILS<br />Botique premium oils are are as variable year to year as wines, comparably expensive, and have to be bought the way you buy fine wine (that is, ideally at tastings, where you confirm the quality and flavor before purchase).  Some are genuinely (as in NOT-gourmet-speak) buttery and nutty---great for dipping.  Some taste like the fragrance of flowers---great for salads.  Never cook premium olive oil---use it for dipping or drizzling, or on delicate salads.  Colavita is a very good general purpose oil, perhaps the best common grocery store olive oil, but is not quite a premium oil.<br /><br />Although heresy (comparable to suggesting fruit wines to a wine connoisseur) there are inexpensive alternatives to premium botique olive oils, including pumpkinseed, almond, sesame, and walnut oil.  I particularly love pumpkinseed oil as a dipping oil (by itself, no vinegar, and with a little salt). The following are examples---I can't vouch for the specific brands as they are different from what I use.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5OCFS">Styrian Pumpkinseed Oil 8.45 oz</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JV3C82">Pure Almond Oil 300ml</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YB21A">Kadoya - Pure Sesame Oil 5.5 Oz.</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017O8F0A">100% Natural Walnut Oil, Cold Pressed 16 fl oz (474 ml) Liquid</a><br /><br />COOKING OIL<br />Non-extra virgin olive oils (second or later pressings) are usually darker and stronger flavored---which adds depth and complexity to soups, sauses, stews, chili, casseroles, bean dishes etc. I add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil to such dishes.  Unless you particularly want the dish to taste "olive-oily" (I never do), cook the oil WITH the dish.  However, olive oil can "go bad"---so unless you use alot, it doesn't sense to use a different cooking oil than you use on salads, for dipping etc.  Colavita is a very good general purpose oil, and therefore a good cooking oil.<br /><br />"Cooking" does NOT mean "frying" with ANY olive oil.  Because of the low smoke point (i.e., olive oil burns at a low temperature) olive oil is NOT suitable for frying.  That said, you can carefully fry an egg in olive oil at a low temperature (and honestly, good fried eggs swimming in good olive oil are wonderful).  But you can NOT fry meat nor deep-fry anything.  The best frying oil is peanut oil.  Canola is a good frying oil and is particularly healthy.  Like olive oil there is variation in the brands.  Peanut oil should be slightly nutty, but not peanutty.  Canola oil should be flavorless.<br /><br />DIPPING OIL<br />Traditionally (and in the best restaurants), Italian bread, oil and balsamic vinegar is served as an appetizer.  The diner usually mixes his own oil and vinegar at the table.  Albeit probably heresy, you can subsitute other premium types of vinegar (such as wine vinegar, rasberry vinegar, or even apple vinegar) or fresh lemon juice.  I usually add a few drops soy sause or Braggs for saltiness and richness to the mixture. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4Y4W">Bragg Liquid Aminos, Natural Soy Sauce Alternative, 32-Ounce Bottle , (Pack of 3)</a> Colavita is a very good "everyday" dipping oil.<br /><br />SALAD OIL<br />The requirements for an "everyday" salad oil are a little less stringent than that for a dipping oil, because the heavy flavor of the vinegar, and often pamessan, bacon bits, etc. usually dominate.  However, I rarely use oil and vinegar the traditional way.  For everyday salads (or as a dip for raw vegies) I prefer olive-oil based mayo with a little freshly ground pepper, and some citrus zest.  For special salads, I use a seed or nut oil or a fruity premium olive oil (and just a hint of lemon and/or orange juice and zest).  Colavita is a very good "everyday" salad oil.  If you are not familiar with fresh citrus zest (wonderful stuff), the tool to use is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S7V8">Microplane 40020 Classic Zester/Grater</a><br /><br />DRIZZING OIL<br />A drizzling oil is an oil you pour over a dish immediately before serving, or which you serve in a carafe on the table.  If you REALLY like the flavor of "ordinary good" olive oil (I don't)---then you will find Colavita to be a good drizzling oil.  My hispanic wife frequently drizzles Colavita on the dishes I've cooked (with Colavita), because she likes the olive-oil flavor.  By the way, the same principle applies to the use of butter, pepper, garlic, cheese, even soy sause---if you want the flavor to dominate, add it just before serving; if you want the flavor to be subtle, cook the seasoning with the dish.  For most dishes I prefer a rich blend of subtle flavors.<br /><br />HEALTHY COOKING<br />I go to a great deal of effort to minimize animal fat in my diet, by very strict trimming, thorough cooking, and by chilling broth to remove the solidified fat.  However, the body needs fat and craves fat.  The ideal solution is to replace animal fat with healthy vegetable oils.  Olive oil is ideal for the purpose.  Canola is better, but is essentially flavorless.<br /><br />My Southern grandmother could not cook any vegetables without a thick slice of fatback (fatty bacon)---and indeed her vegetables were very tasty.  Speaking of which, what is the point of healthy vegetables if no-one will eat them?  The solution is to add several tablespoon fulls of olive oil, and just a teaspoon of chipped ham <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NERTSE">Hormel Premium Real Crumbled Bacon</a> to the vegies.  For the best flavor, cook the vegies with the olive oil (do NOT add oil to the cooked vegetables---unless you really like the flavor of the oil).  Season as necessary with pepper and fresh lemon juice.  Truly delicious vegetables are possible---I eat them daily.<br /><br />ECONOMY<br />It has been about a year since I've purchased Colavita because I can buy a better but obscure brand (Bella Famiglia) locally for $12 per 17oz bottle.  The 34 ounce tins of Colavita <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLB16">Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 34-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a> are about half the price of the bottle per oz at this time, but is still expensive for the quality, particularly with the shipping charge.  The tins are small enough to use directly. But I prefer bottles, because controlling the flow of the oil is easier (since you can see the oil approaching the spout), and it is easier to gauge the amount of oil I'm using by eye (how far the level drops in the glass bottle). So, I refill bottles from the tins.  I've been told that olive oil stays fresher in tins (measured in months and years) That becomes relevant when you don't know how many months (or even years) a bottle may have sat on a grocery shelf.<br /><br />GENERAL RECCOMENDATION<br />The price of many items, including Colavita vary wildly on Amazon, sometimes from day-to-day.  Sometimes it is available directly from Amazon with free shipping, sometimes not---which makes a big difference in the total coat.  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.

review/summary: Ugh.
review/text: Bought this at a local market, on sale thankfully, and am fully disappointed. It's bitter and doesn't have great olive flavor, though it is quite a beautiful green color. If you're looking for a mid-premium olive oil I'd recommend Alessi or Lucini way over this product and both are in the same price range.

They are expensive, but totally worth it to me.  Plus this price on Amazon.com was great.<br /><br />I highly recommend these chews if you have a small dog.

review/summary: Much better than bagged teas
review/text: I recently got into spearmint tea after reading that it may help with hormonal acne (which I have yet to draw a conclusion at this point). First, pure spearmint tea is pretty hard to find, most of those sold in stores are mixed with some other flavors. Prior to using Tao of Tea, I have been drinking Alvita's spearmint tea (this is sold at most health food stores), and the flavor really tasted like mint and has a very strong (in a good way) mint aroma to it. However, I wanted to try loose teas as I read that they are usually better (for various reasons which I won't get into).<br /><br />Well, let's just say that there's a world's difference between the two. Not only is this loose tea much STRONGER than Alvita's tea bags, but even the taste is different. I actually grew up eating spearmints, and my parents grow them in our backyard (I'm Asian-American), so I know exactly what the actual leaves taste like. I didn't taste any of that in Alvita's (and Pukka's 3 mint tea). It took me a while to realize that spearmint tea was the same spearmint I've been eating all my life! When I tasted Tao of Tea's, I thought to myself "THERE'S that flavor I'm use to!"<br /><br />So overall, as far as which one is "better" for you, I really don't know. However, I can say with certainty that this loose tea definitely tastes like actual spearmint, and not just, well...mint (like the kind you get in candies). Ironically, I actually like Alvita's taste more because it tastes like the commercialized mint we're all used to. However, without a doubt, Tao of Tea (I have not tried other loose tea brands) is more "authentic" tasting, so I'll continue using loose teas rather than bags.<br /><br />I mix this spearmint tea with loose green tea that I buy at the Asian supermarket (this mix is generally called "Moroccan Mint" apparently). Using Alvita's, all I tasted was the green tea, but using TofT's I actually taste the spearmint a lot more....<br /><br />Note: this review is mostly a comparison of bagged teas vs. loose teas. I don't mean to imply that the Alvita brand itself is inferior.

Learn from my mistake: pay a little more and get less for higher quality in a tin.<br /><br />On a positive note, the vendor was prompt with the shipping.

review/text: I remember years ago the first Wasabi peanuts I bought from a local gourmet food store were 100 times hotter then theses cheap knock-offs.<br />They were truly wasabi covered peanuts. These peanuts are covered first in a layer of soybean paste than a very thin coating of wasabi for color. I would say they are using a green food colored horseradish not true wasabi.<br /><br />If you like something crunchy and very mild heat, buy these. They are like eatting M&M candies. I read the other reviews before buying and all said "Wow these are HOT! I say Bologna!<br /><br />Which goes to show... you can always make something cheap.

review/text: Unbeatable! I've been cruising the protein bar isle for years, and this product just took first place in my book! I relapsed on carbs when I had Odwalla's Peanut Crunch Bar (though yummy very high in carbs). Who needs to cheat when there are Kind Bars on hand. I do confess, I like this one so well that I haven't tried the others yet!<br /><br />I have read on other sites that if the supplier isn't rotating or selling enough to keep fresh stock on hand, you might get a stale batch. That is an unfortunate consequence when the food item is without preservatives, as in this case. I recommend that if you get a stale shipment you notify whom ever you ordered from, and request a replacement. These are not intended to be rock hard or chewy like taffy. Just perfect...

review/text: I like these bars because they are all natural and I feel like I'm getting a snack while still eating healthy.  The sugar grams are a little high, but at least they're coming from natural sources (honey, glucose) and not refined sugars.  They're not TOO sweet... they just taste very natural - like you dipped mixed, raw nuts into honey and ate it.  They're very crunchy and satisfy hunger cravings very well.  I love to get these at Borders bookstore as a nice healthy snack option while I'm out shopping.  I looked here to try some of the other flavors, but I'm hesitant to stray from the Nut Delight because it seems the other Kind bars have more saturated fat and more grams of sugar.  The Nut Delight seems like the best option of the bunch.

review/text: I suppose I should have figured this bar would be crunchy considering this is the Nut Delight variety but I didn't expect this much crunch! Crunch factor similar to Gobstopper hard candy (I think it is the syrup that holds the nuts together that makes it so hard). There was also a type of nut that is included in the mix that I did not care for, (not sure which one). If you like exotic nuts and are looking for a snack that is super crunchy than this is for you. Unfortunately, it did not suit me. On the up side, it is a good source of protein and antioxidents.

The second shipment is not quite so crunchy, and my husband suggested warming them in the microwave if they're too crisp.  They haven't needed that special treatment, but they're still not as soft as the Almond & Apricot and Macadamia Nut & Apricot flavors.  Since all the flavors comprise one sweet that I can eat without triggering allergies, they will all remain on my automatic order list.

review/text: It is hard to describe what these bars actually are.  First I am always on the look out for a candy bar that has nuts, no chocolate and is not sickeningly sweet.  TA DA!  Enter the KIND BAR company.  These work as  candy bars.  YUMMY.  These work as a nice under 200 calorie snack to tide you over in between meals.  These definitely are nutrition bars.  Packed with good natural ingredients, these bars are great to keep in your desk or pop into your purse for any emergency hunger attacks.

Even though this was not a normally refundable item through Amazon, they did give me a full refund, but they were not interested in my offer to ship it back to them at their expense to find out what went so horribly wrong.  The food safety system in this country is horribly broken.  After the peanut scancal of last year, it would be nice if something had changed and people were more responsible for what they put out there.<br />  In my opinion, the problem was improper storage temp. at the ware house, or ingredients too old.<br />Really a shame because it is such a good cause otherwise, and I love nuts.

review/summary: Taste good but...
review/text: These bars are tasty. Recently, many brands of health bars have come out with chunks of fruits and nuts glued together with a sticky sweetener, such as aguave syrup, honey or evaporated cane juice. KIND Bars are not exceptional among these bars, and all of these types of snacks are very good in my experience.<br /><br />What makes KIND Bars different is that a portion of the profits is directed to the PeaceWorks Foundation, which is a charity that supports peace in the Middle East. By "peace in the Middle East," they mean support for the "Palestinian Resistance" againgst the Israeli "occupation." This charity is considered centrist, and it rejects extremism, which it finds to be ineffective.<br /><br />Executive Manager of the PeaceWorks Foundation, Fathi Mohamed Hamdan Darwish, had this to say about the strategy of driving Israel into the Sea: "That solution is unrealistic and ineffective and can't be realized. We as a Palestinian people have historically paid the price of hundreds of thousands of martyrs and injured people and haven't reached this solution."

review/summary: Convenient & tasty
review/text: I recently bought an 8 ounce home popper and had read favorable reviews about the pre-packaged kernels, coconut oil, and salt packets.  After scouring Amazon and reading the reviews, I finally settled on Great Northern.<br /><br />The packaged shipped immediately within a day of purchase and arrived on schedule.  Be warned that based on the climate in your area, the oil portion in the packets may be solidified or liquid.  Regardless, it melts instantly in a hot kettle if you receive it solid.<br /><br />As for the taste, I was not disappointed one bit.  Some reviews have mentioned that it is too salty, but I found it just right.  I do prefer salty foods, though.  Based on the look of it, I thought it would turn the popcorn a ridiculous yellow hue, but it didn't.  The taste was exactly like you'd get at the theater or ballpark and it was not too greasy.  I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to make theater style popcorn at home.

review/text: After reading reviews I purchased the 2.5 oz. pkgs. of Great Northern Popcorn. It popped up nicely.  Very few "old maids". I did notice that a lot of moisture gathered on the sides of our popper (the Waring WPM25 model) during the popping process so I pulled the tray of popcorn out promptly. I could see if you left it in the machine, even for a few minutes, that the popcorn could absorb the moisture and lose its crunchy texture.<br />I will definitely buy this product again.

review/text: I think the Wabash Valley Farms portion packs taste the most like the popcorn I get in my local theaters, but the Great Northern Popcorn Company's Portion Packs taste the best.  Using the full portion of flavored salt does make it too salty for my taste so I use just 3/4 of the portion amount (the 4-Oz. portion pack contains exactly 1 teaspoon of flavored salt).  I've also found that the 6-Oz. portion packs work just fine in my 4-Oz. Maxi-Matic Table-Top Popper, better suited to movie night party quantities.

review/text: With all the rave reviews, coupled with the fact that these pre-packs include all the right ingredients, I assumed the  result would be at least 75% authentic carnival style popcorn for my popcorn maker. After all, I have used packs like this for over 10 years (at a previous employers Ag Equipment business), of which was amazing!  This product is not. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate it about a 2. It is edible; although extremely salty. Tastes nothing like carnival style popcorn, severely lacking in butter flavor. The only positive aspect of this product is the convenience in the pack itself. So if you're used to buying cheap jiffy-pop, over the stove style popcorn, this would be better. I Would not recommend.

review/text: I like that these packages are just the right size for 1-2 people and that there are very few unpopped kernels.  This does taste a lot like the popcorn at the movies.  If you like your popcorn very salty, this is the product for you!  However, I don't!  I like more butter flavor and only a little salt.  It's simple enough to snip off a small corner of the popcorn side of the packet and pour out most of the salt.  Unfortunately, out of the 20 packets I bought, six of them were not separated properly and the salt and kernels mixed with the oil, so I am stuck with the six overly salty bowls of popcorn.  I really wish this company made a low salt or unsalted version of these packs.  I'd definitely buy more if I didn't have to taste all that salt!

review/text: I recently purchased this popcorn and less than half of the popcorn popped.  And those that did pop were tough. I believe these were old.  I've purchased other brands and they all have an expiration date printed on back each pack.  These had no expiration dates printed, therefore there was no way of knowing how old these were or how long they have been in their stock. I popped the jolly time brand and it popped perfectly.  I also find that this is on the list of things that can't be returned per Amazon.com policy.  I'm going to purchase the Jolly time popcorn at Smart & Finals. Cheaper and there fresh!!!

review/summary: Best Popcorn Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: My family loves the taste of the popcorn and our guest love the fact that I have a popcorn machine that I proudly display in our bar area of our home. When I say it taste better than movie popcorn is that when you couple our popcorn machine with a high quality popcorn product like Great Northern, you get a complete balanced salt, butter and movie popcorn flavor. Don't go cheap on the popcorn and you will never buy microwave popcorn again. Great Northerns 6 oz popcorn bag comes premeasured and you will never have to add salt or additional butter to get the movie taste that we are all after. Plus the upside, unlike movie popcorn where you go to that giant butter machine,squirt that liquid death over the top part of yor popcorn only to find that it never reaches the bottom of the bag. This has the same great taste without making you feel like a short order cook at McDonalds and each kernal taste just like the first. I am a part time chef (fulltime banker:)), I will never buy any other popcorn product again after eating this.  Kuddo's to Great Northern for a fantastic and consistantly GREAT product!

review/summary: Updated Review
review/text: Had to rescind my previous review, I finally figured out why the popcorn was not working properly.  I got the Paramount Entertainment popcorn maker with the 6 oz kettle.<br /><br />Here's the right way to pop this corn in the 6 oz version, take exactly half of the three ingredients and put them in and THEN when they are done do the other half.  No more 60% old maids anymore, thing is the bag seems sized to the 8 0z hopper and its just too much for the 6oz at once so alot wasnt popping.  Doing half at a time changed everything, very good popcorn!

review/summary: Ok in a pinch, but found better alternative
review/text: Got this to go along with the Maxi-Matic 4oz machine.  It gets the 3 stars just because of everything being pre-packaged.  I didn't care for the flavor of the popcorn and found it not buttery and overly salty.  Will try to not dump all of the salt in next time.<br /><br />I found a better alternative was using a product called Butter-it which I purchased a gallon of through a local restaurant since it is sold by Sysco. It is a soybean oil base so it's liquid. Use 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 heaping cup of kernals and if you want add a splash of salt and it is the best popcorn I have ever had....well, it is the same as in the pub I got the oil from, but still the best.

review/summary: Stale Popcorn
review/text: We are disappointed with the Great Northern popcorn for our new machine.<br />It seems stale.....and 'chewy'.<br />We have a popcorn machine up north and it pops beautifully and tastes like theater popcorn.<br />However, the popcorn we have just received seems old.  We're very disappointed....and wind up not making popcorn very often.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I was very excited to try this popcorn given all the rave reviews.  Like another reviewer, however, I am disappointed by the amount of unpopped corn.  I did three batches in my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NCPXBG">Maxi-Matic EPM-450 Elite Tabletop Old-Fashioned 4-Ounce Kettle Popcorn Popper Machine</a>.<br /><br />There was over a third of the popcorn left unpopped in each of those batches.  I was afraid it was my new popper so decided to try it in my old Stir Crazy popper.  This time there was about 1/4 of unpopped kernels but at least a full cup of poorly popped corn (tiny, tough pieces).<br /><br />So I tried some old Orville Redenbacher's I had in the pantry in the new popper.  Almost all of it popped with only about a tablespoon of unpopped kernels.<br /><br />The flavor of the Great Northern was wonderful and what DID pop was crunchy and not at all soggy.  I don't know if I was sent old product (I couldn't find an expiration date anywhere) but I won't be ordering it again.

review/summary: Good movie style popcorn, a bit salty
review/text: These packets are easy to use. Not the most healthy thing in the world. Very salty. Sometimes too salty for my taste.

review/summary: Popcorn
review/text: We have purchased this popcorn twice. It's just the right amount for our popcorn popper as we have a 4 oz kettle on the stand up machine. About 95% of the corn pops so expect to lose a little but this is normal with an automatic paper as occasionally a popped grain of corn will take an unpopped grain of corn with it as it leaves the kettle. The oil in the packages in the first batch stayed firm however the oil in the second order is completely melted. We have not yet figured out the reasons as storage condition for each were exactly the same. This is a good product however you are paying a lot more than bulk ingredients when it comes prepackaged like this.

review/summary: Perfect movie theater popcorn!
review/text: These packets are all you need to achieve the perfect movie theater popcorn experience!  If you love popcorn like we do look no further!  It's not to greasy and is a little on the salty side but it only makes you want to eat more!  To make, just follow the instruction on the packet by pre-heating the pot then dumping the contents in.<br /><br />The packets are divided into a solid oil side and a kernel/salt side.  If you want to reduce the salt content, Just pinch the bottom of the packet where the salt is, holding some of the salt back from going into the pot.  Although, our family loves it just the way it is!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product as I will be buying more soon through Amazon.com!

review/summary: Great for the price
review/text: I've been buying this popcorn on the subscription program for the last 1.5 years. Overall, the kids absolutely love the popcorn - it tastes even better than the movies and for under $1.00 per bag, I figure I'm getting a good deal. However, one issue I have is the large number of "Old Maid" unpopped kernels. I haven't used other brands, so I'm not sure what is normal, but it seems that about 20% of the kernels do not pop. This is an average over 1.5 years of using the Great Northern brand in a Great Northern popcorn machine.<br /><br />If you have found a popcorn that makes a higher % of the kernels, you may want to avoid this brand, unless of course, it costs 25% more $.

review/summary: BEST POPCORN EVER!
review/text: I wanted to find the same popcorn used in bars & at the movie theater and THIS IS IT! This is the best tasting popcorn I have ever had! I have a kettle style corn popper and this is the only popcorn I'll ever buy again. I even popped the popcorn on the stove to see if it would taste the same and it did! This is the only popcorn you should buy!
