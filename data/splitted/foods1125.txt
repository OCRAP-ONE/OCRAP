review/text: i have purchased just about every coconut oil brand out there and find garden of life to be the best. other less expensive brands often leave an odd aftertaste or chemical residue even if they claim to be organic. i find this product to be consistently clean tasting. have been taking daily for over a year and have noticed improvement in skin, energy, immune system, and clarity of thought/memory. after initially feeling resistant to the idea of eating fat, i can't imagine life without this product. no weight gain at up to 3 tablespoons a day. don't let the medical establishment's misunderstanding about saturated fats scare you into not using this product. i have only benefited from it after years of low fat eating that was slowly destroying my health. but do start slowly, its not uncommon to feel a little nauseous( apparently as a result of being unused to digesting fats) or to have looser bowels initially( it has been used as a laxative).......

review/summary: Great for Skin and Hair
review/text: I use this as a hair and scalp oil.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny. There's no greasy or residue buildup. It absorbs right into the hair and scalp,  If you apply to your hair, wait few minutes and then run your fingers through your hair, there will be no residue on your fingers--none.  Your hair will feel soft, supple, and look shiny.  A previous reviewer said she uses it on her skin. I do too. I usually put in on my face before bed.  Just like she said, it absorbs right into your skin and there is no residue.<br /><br />I started using it because my mom has uses it.  But, I never knew much about it.  I did an online search to find out more about this oil.  According to the information I got, with regular use, Coconut oil can help reverse sun damage and reduce signs of aging on your face and neck.  The article also said it helps eliminate "liver spots"  The reason given was that coconut oil breaks down so fast that it really does absorb into the layers of your skin, instead of just sitting on the surface like so many face creams and lotions do.  It is good for the skin. I'm 50, and my skin is holding up pretty well.  I have very few "liver" spots near my ears, but absolutely none on my forehead and cheeks.  A lot of people have a whole face full of them by the time they are my age.  It is a healthy oil to consume.  It is solid, but it breaks down so easily in the body that the liver(the real organ) doesn't have to even get involved in the breaking down process, like it does with most fats we consume.  It's a shame, I always thought this was one of the worst oils you could eat.  Turns out, it's one of the best oils to consume.  If you do an online search, you can find a lot of information about the many benefits of coconut oil by an MD. You can even find out how it got it's bad reputation,

Of course with the awful heat wave we're still in, the oil had liquified but I put some on my hair immediately. My hair was incredibly soft for the next THREE days!!! I will continue to purchase from this seller one, because there's not a Whole Foods for miles where I live and two, I'm so satisfied with their business.

review/summary: Excellent Product!
review/text: This is an excellent product, although it hasn't helped me lose weight yet, but I ran out of it before maximizing all its benefits.  The main uses have been for our dog (added a couple tablespoons to her food to help her skin), our dry skin, and even "intimate" moments (it's better than anything else we have tried).  Since coconut oil is a natural ingredient, hypoallergenic and antibacterial, it's perfect for inside and outside of our bodies (except perhaps, for eyes and ears).  My husband has eczema and it's been one of the most helpful products we have found.

review/summary: Best Tasting Coconut Oil
review/text: If you care what your coconut oil tastes like, then this is the one to get. Other unrefined coconut oils I tried have a slightly greasy aftertaste. I like that it comes in a glass jar as some people have reported tasting plastic leeching into other oils.<br /><br />This oil tastes like eating coconut candy. It's very light, slightly sweet and not greasy at all.

review/summary: Wonderful for conditioning and moisturizing the hair and scalp
review/text: I use this product on my hair and scalp and it is a great conditioner. It is very light and absorbs quickly in my hair and scalp. It is non-greasy. I like this product because it is extra virgin meaning it is the least processed and the most purest oil. It keeps the scalp moisturized so the scalp does not itch or get dandruff. I really like using this on my hair especially after washing while I air dry my hair. I used my first bottle and I just ordered another. It also has a light refreshing smell and not overpowering at all. Coconut Oil is a great product for hair, it also makes the hair shiny too. I recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy hair and scalp.

review/text: I love that the shipping of this product was within the time limit, and it arrived fresh and it smelled to good. i use it on hair, mix it with shea butter for the body and hair actually. TIP: if you melt shea butter and add coconut oil to it and put it freezer overnight(so it won't be grainy) it will stay softer, i think because the coconut oil is not as solid as the shea. Also i use some coconut oil in my rice, sooo good.

I dont use this on my face because I have a skin care regimen that I like already but this product is great for your hair.

review/text: I've been using this for multiple purposes - for hair and skin care, and for cooking. Makes my hair really soft and soaks in nicely, and even though I have never had particularly rough skin, I am noticing a difference with softness. For cooking, I don't know exactly how well it's working - it's supposed to boost metabolism and promote energy, but I've only been taking it for a week so I haven't really noticed. But one thing's for sure, it's a lot healthier than cooking with butter...

review/summary: Haven't used it for cooking but if it's as good as it is in toiletries...
review/text: This product has a host of books and reviews about its benefits to folks when consumed in place of other oils, but I don't use it for cooking.  It's my all-in-one cosmetic.  I use it to condition my hair (pre-wash, or use a little on the ends of hair after wash), moisturizer, make-up remover, and couldn't be happier.  It's so inexpensive next to all the other things I used to use, that now don't take up all that room in my bath.  I cannot speak highly enough about it as a beauty aid.  No more facial moisturizers, make-up removers, eyelash conditioner, body moisturizer, and hair treatments.  All-in-one, and perfect at all of it.  Then there's the smell of summer that it leaves on you and in your hair.  Gorgeous, I feel like there's a little piece of the Hamptons on me.  Only one thing wrong - if you're not looking to tan or burn be careful in the sun, it's an oil, folks.  Also, it's liquid in high heat, so pack it well in your suitcase.  Use a baggie over it, just in case.

The product is great, I gifted one to a friend who uses it for eczema. It smells great too! tried it on my face but it ended up breaking me out for a week so I think I'll start using jojoba oil instead to moisturize/clean out pores on my face. This coconut oil is great for the rest of the body and eating/mixing in green tea.

I've used it to fry apples mixed with lemon, a little bit of sugar, delicious vanilla (also ordered from Amazon.com) and cinnamon - delicious! I tried some on my skin, my hair (which felt silky afterwards) - going coconuts with it! It melts immediately upon contact with the skin. I like that the fragrance is subtle and not overpowering like fake me out coconut fragrances are. So far I am happy with my purchase. I will continue to experience cooking with this oil as well as using on my skin and hair. Try it, I think you'll like it!

review/summary: Simply delicious and healthy too!
review/text: I love this oil.<br /><br />My first attraction to it was based upon my research which led me to the realization that unrefined organic coconut oil is healthy for you.  So many reports about the dangers of coconut oil were based on poorly the poorly refined kind.<br /><br />No trans fatty acids here!<br /><br />It has anti-bacteria and anti-fungal properties.<br /><br />Two books on the use of coconut oil are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0941599604">Coconut Cures: Preventing and Treating Common Health Problems with Coconut</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049">The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)</a>, both by Bruce Fife.  Both are good, but if I were to choose between the two, I would go with Coconut Cures which has the recommended therapeutic amount of coconut oil to injest on a daily basis.  The Coconut Oil Miracle has the recommended amount of coconut oil if you are ill (high dosage amount).<br /><br />This oil is so fresh and clean tasting that I happily eat it raw.<br /><br />I also cook with it, make homemade popcorn in the stockpot and you can't taste the coconut flavor.<br /><br />I also rub it on my skin.<br /><br />This is a fantastic all which has many uses!

review/summary: Good Quality Coconut Oil
review/text: I bought this brand of coconut oil strictly for beauty, bodily purposes.  It works quite well as an overall face and body moisturizer, although I use it primarily as a lip treatment during these cold, dry winter months.  It's still in solid form due to the cold weather in my area, but I've just been taking small chunks of it and allowing it to melt in my hands for a few seconds or so before applying to skin.  As others users have noted, I've found this oil to have a toasty-like smell which I don't mind so much.  I might try the Nutiva brand next time because I've heard it has a nicer smell.  In the near future I'll probably purchase more coconut oils just for cooking/baking purposes.  I give this brand an A.

review/text: Amazon's delivery is super fast.  This stuff is wonderful and smell like the real coconut! Reminds me of the tropics.  I ordered 4 jars of this EVCO and gave some to my mom to try.  She loves it.<br /><br />I have been using EVCO for about a month now and I am very HAPPY with it. I take about 1 TBLSP/day internally; put in my coffee, spread it on my toast.  No only is my enery level up, the pain from my shoulder bursitis is gone. Since I have been taking EVCO, I haven't have to take my medication for my bursitis and joint pain.<br /><br />This is also great to clean my face with at night followed by warm damp cloth.  It makes my skin so soft. I have combination skin and have always been afraid to put anything heavy and oily on my face due to acne breakouts.

review/summary: Love it...love it...love it!!!
review/text: I am now officially a fan of coconut oil!!! I was a bit sceptical at first, but this stuff really is awesome. My wife and I have a jar in our bedroom and use it primarily for skin lotion, but have also used it as a massage oil and as an intimate lubricant(works great...edible too!). We also have a jar in our baby's room and have used it to cure diaper rash and dry skin. The best thing about applying coconut oil to your baby's skin is that it's natural and edible, so you don't have to worry about it getting on their hands, which also means in their mouth. And you don't have to worry about what chemicals you're rubbing into your baby's skin.<br /><br />Like the other reviews have stated, this stuff is solid below 76 degrees and a liquid at or above 76 degrees. As a solid, it's a bit gritty at first, but almost immediately melts in your hand. Also, i'm amazed by how little you actually need....a tiny bit goes a long way. The first time I gave my wife a massage with this, I ended up putting on way too much and ended up wiping a bunch off with a towel. I also stained the sheets that night, but I think it came out after a few washes. BTW, the scent is a very light coconut scent...i'm not a big fan of coconut smell to begin with, but this doesn't bother me in the least.

review/text: Very nice!  I bought this coconut oil for my natural hair, and I'm not disappointed. I made my own concoction of 100% pure oils, sweet almond, jojoba, castor, coconut, shea butter, and alittle  neem oil. A few dabs on the scalp is plenty, then massage it in. This mixture is just as great on the skin, extremely moisturizing. Neem oil has a very pungent smell so if you decide to use this formula just a drop or two will suffice. I'm definitely sold on this product! &#9733;HAPPY TO BE NAPPY&#9733;

I don't think the 16 oz jar is going to last long.<br /><br />The math is wrong the 16 oz jar isn't 26 cents an ounce more like 55 cents an ounce. I wasn't buying it based on price, I was bought it based on reviews. This had the best reviews and I now know why. I am glad that it came in a glass jar, after talking to my friends, the plastic containers will alter the taste of the oil. So for a pure tasting coconut oil, I wanted to make sure the one I got came in a glass container.

review/text: I did research on the benefits of coconut oil and the skin how it absorbs easily and that it makes an ideal ointment for the relief of dry, rough and wrinkled skin and it's good for psoriasis and eczema suffers. I am brown skinned and I'm 47 and have good skin most people NEVER guess I'm 47 -- but I thought if this is good, it will preserve skin. Well, when I first put it on, my face felt like a baby's bottom, it seems to absorb well and I noticed my skin is even softer, and it does seem to have a "glow" --But I must admit after this absorbs my skin needs a little extra moisturizer (perhaps because it's getting colder) but I will follow up with a shea lotion.

review/summary: Great coconut oil
review/text: This is the first coconut oil I tried. It is great. Great taste, great smell, great consistency. With all the brands out there, it can be hard to pick one to start with. Somehow I went with Garden of Life and it worked out great. Ive also had Nutiva, which a lot of people use and can be found for a bit cheaper. You can buy a gallon tub from the direct website for cheaper. So shop around on Amazon and other sites once youve selected the brand you want.<br /><br />Coconut oil, youve heard all the great things it does. Here are some things that hopefully persuade you more:<br /><br />Ive found that when refrying leftovers, such as chinese food or meatballs, it actually IMPROVES the flavor over the original. With coconut oil, you can avoid microwaving, which does alter the taste and texture, and some say destroys nutrients and adds toxins. Just stir fry with coconut oil and enjoy your delicious leftovers!<br /><br />It may serve as a bit of a replacement for vanilla in baking. The main purpose of vanilla is to add flavor. Unfortunately, the vanilla we had at home had the dreaded CORN SYRUP in it (READ YOUR LABELS). I looked online and it appeared that it could be omitted anyway, but as it turned out, coconut oil appears to provide that underflavor. Add a hint of coconut to your baking!<br /><br />Yes, coconut oil can be much more expensive than regular oil, but you cant and shouldnt cook with olive oil. Almost every other oil is bad (soybean, canola, corn) or just not as good (butter). Think of it as an investment in your future. I know people who arent of strong financial means that would be hard pressed to give up their "coco" as I call it.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Excellent Root Beer
review/text: Over the course of my years, I've visited many places that served root beer, and Fitz's root beer, besides Virgil's root beer, is one of the best root beers I've ever had in my life. Fitz's root beer is yummy, and their other products, strawberry pop, cream soda, grape pop, and orange pop are delicious as well. If you ever visit St. Louis, go to Fitz's American Grill & Bottling Works. They serve a variety of awesome burgers, sandwiches, floats, shakes, and malts. This restaurant was featured on the Food Network's "Rachael Ray's Tasty Travels" - St. Louis episode. And this place is one of the few restaurants where you can watch a root beer bottling line in operation while eating in the main dining room (you have to call them for bottling operation hours). For those individuals not living in Missouri or Illinois (Midwest region), where Fitz's root beers, sodas are sold in many stores, this is an excellent chance for you to try some great tasting Midwestern root beer. Root beer fans won't be disappointed!

The first few shots that I made came out a bit too quickly (as others have mentioned) and had a slightly wattery taste with very little crema.<br /><br />THIS ISSUE CAN BE RESOLVED!<br /><br />After the first few shots, I decided to add some additional tamping pressure to the pod by pressing down on it with a solid object (I found that a mason jar or coffee mug both worked great) with the hopes that this would increase brewing time and provide a more satisfying shot.<br /><br />It worked, and now my shots come out perfect, with good flavor and tons of crema.  I have to give these pods four stars for the poor tamping, but fortunately this is something that can be resolved quite easily.

review/summary: Excellent Espresso
review/text: Great Espresso Pod.  I use it with my Breville 800.  Good flavor, and its quick and easy to dispose.  At first I was running into problems with the pod but followed anothers advice and now it works great.  You need to wet the pod filter first, then put the pod in and tamp it down.  The moisture on the filter helps hold the pod down.  Other than that it works great.  Buy with subscribtion and save...

review/summary: Great coffee, but...
review/text: Lavazza makes a fantastic coffee; however, these pods, designated ESE, do not work well with my Francis! Francis! ESE espresso maker.  In comparison, it takes an average of 20-22 seconds to pull a shot with the illy ESE pods.  These Lavazza pods take, on average, 5-8 seconds -- way too fast!  (Maybe the coffee is not packed well enough inside the pods?)<br /><br />When in Italy (and here at home), I drink a lot of illy and Lavazza, but, sorry to disappoint, these pods were not up to par!  Of course, if you're in a rush in the morning, maybe shaving off 15 seconds is a good thing!

review/summary: Great Espresso - Reasonably priced and easy clean up!
review/text: I make this espresso with my DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker and it comes out beautifully.  The espresso that comes out is a rich dark chocolate color with a nice layer of crema.<br /><br />As another review as noted, the espresso is not packed as tightly in the pod as other brands, such as Starbucks, but this issue is easily resolved if you wet the pod and then press it down with a good metal tamper.  Once you do this, the espresso that comes out is perfect. If you buy this product in bulk and then on auto-delivery from Amazon, the value is very good and much cheaper than going to a coffee shop every day for a latte or cappuccino.<br /><br />I like pods because the clean up and measuring is done for me - super easy.  I love being able to make lattes in my home.  Companies like Lavazza make it easy!

review/summary: Starbucks??? Really???
review/text: These are by far the best espresso pods available, I have tried them all. Lavazza has long been known to produce some of the best coffee in Italy. If you like the over roasted, bitter, breath stinking crap they serve at Starbucks, you will not like good espresso like Lavazza. If you appreciate real espresso that creates a strong crema and a smooth taste, these are for you. Those that have been to Italy know what I mean.

review/summary: Lavazza pods dont work with Lavazza/Cuisinart machine
review/text: I have a Lavazza Cuisinart machine. It came with Lavazza pre packaged pods. I liked the way it worked so I ordered more here. The new Lavazza pods did not fit my machine. They are a smaller diameter and thicker. They dont work. The bad thing is there is no sizing number or code to tell what pods fit what machines. This is a non returnable item so i am stuck with them at my expense. Since there are obviously different pods for different machines wouldnt you think that there would be a number or color code stamped on them?

review/summary: Great coffee.  Get whole bean if you want that "God Shot"
review/text: I was first unimpressed at the taste and performance of the Lavazza pods, but I think it had to do with my initial lack of experience with my machine (Rancilio Silvia) and the loosely packed pods as other reviews have mentioned.<br /><br />Once I got accustomed to getting the correct temperature water while pulling my shot and also dealing with the loosely packed pods (I use my tamper to just pack it into the filter basket), I have noticed a marked improvement in taste and crema production.<br /><br />Yes, they tend to pull a little too fast (10-15 seconds.  My understanding is that even single shots should pull for the same amount of time), but for the convenience, what more can you ask for?  I'm not one of those people who is willing to invest an exponential amount of effort to achieve the 99th percentile if, for a minimum amount of work, I can accomplish the 90th.  The fact that cleanup is much easier is also a nice plus.  Call my lazy if you will, but that's just what I value.<br /><br />For those who have grown accustomed to drinking Starbucks cigarette butts or some of the finer dark roasts that have dominated US of A (I am a Peet's freak), this coffee might be a shocker at first taste.  It's a medium roast which many Europeans tend to prefer in their espresso and might take some getting used to.  If you're more of a straight espresso drinker, you might find a medium roast like this coffee more sweet and fruity on the palette as it leaves less of a lingering bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's a great bang for the buck and with the convenience/consistency factor of the ESE pod, I'm willing to overlook the fact that it doesn't pull that ever elusive "God shot" (even most cafes sell mediocre espresso).  If that last 10% does matter for you, then get the whole bean stuff.

review/summary: Works well in Sirena
review/text: I needed an alternative to grinding my own when time didn't permit doing it properly. My <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010Z9LI6">Starbucks Sirena Espresso Machine, Stainless and Black</a> came with an ESE pod holder so I decided to give it a try. The pods do not seem dense enough coming out of the sealed packet to make a good espresso but the end product proves otherwise. Nice and very consistent crema over the course of the last forty shots. The pod has to be positioned just so to avoid the filter's tab from overlapping the portafilter seal but this is easily accomplished. The taste is smooth and similar to what I would get from a fresh medium roast Columbian, not at all like the over roasted concoctions that other's bill as an espresso roast. It is so quick to pop a pod out and put a fresh one in that double shots and entertaining are easy to accomplish. That's my main problem now, I'm only grinding my own when I want something different and have a leisurely amount of time. Weekdays = ESE & Weekends = grind. Looks like Lavazza is now my standard cup.

review/summary: A bit watery, but a great bargain.
review/text: Because of the extraordinary value (under 30 cents per cup with subscription pricing) I consider this a good choice. Like the prior reviewers, I wonder if the denseness of the pod is an issue; my machine (nothing fancy, a sub-$200 Briel) consistently draws a cup about twice the volume as when I use the similar Illy brand pods. The result with the Lavazza pods isn't the best cup I've had, but it's the best 30-cent "hit" around! I'll continue my subscription as long as the value is this good.

review/summary: Pods work well for my machine, and taste better.
review/text: I have a Francis Francis X1, and I read a couple of reviews about people's pods not being packed tightly enough.  I noticed this on the first brewing and just chose a smaller setting tightening the filter holder onto the machine a little tighter.  With the Illy pods I would usually pick the large size "espresso lungo," but now I just tighten it down a setting to "espresso" or medium size.<br /><br />I like the flavor of these pods a lot better than the Illy ones, and they're a lot cheaper and easier to buy in bulk.  I had previously tried the Illy regular AND dark roast.  I'm not a connoisseur by any means, but I really like the flavor of the Lavazza better for making lattes.  Overall, I'm 100% satisfied with the product and will definitely stock up with the same ones when I run out.

review/summary: Great coffee if done right
review/text: Read the 1 star reviews.  They are similar to my initial experience.  The pods are shaped differently from the Starbucks pods I've used.  Starbucks pods have worked very well for me.  The Lavazza pods are smaller in diameter than the Starbucks pods and don't seat in the pod filter well.  If placed in normally, they can unseat when you mount the filter into the machine.  The result is a shot that starts out watery and finishes quickly.  The shot is too watery to be enjoyed.<br /><br />However, I've played with these (dozens of experiments!) and found a way to make them work.  I wet the metal pod filter first.  This causes the pod to cling to the filter and stay seated properly.  I also press down on the pod with my thumb to pack the grounds more tightly, being careful not to break the pod.  The result is a shot that takes about the same time to complete as a Starbucks pod and with normal concentration.  Brewed this way, you get the full Lavazza flavor, which is very rich.<br /><br />I use a Breville 800, which I also like.<br /><br />I will buy these pods again.

review/summary: Espresso Pods make mornings easier
review/text: We have a Starbuck$ Expresso machine that came with a ESE Pod adapter for the portafilter cup. I make my wife a mocha every morning before we head off to work, and used to buy the Starbuck$ pods in a box of ten for I think about $5/bx. But they were sometimes hard to find so we would buy three or four boxes whenever we did find them (somethimes cleaning out the store's entire stock). The espresso from the starbucks pods was not that good - sometimes bitter, often 'flat' with little or no 'crema'. And let me tell you I follow the instructions in the video to the letter!<br /><br />I can't rememember where I purchased the first box of Lavazza Pods - maybe Metropolitan Market?  Anyway, the espresso is much better than starbuck$ and always produces a nice tan froth. It's smooth and smells really good - I'm not normally an espresso drinker but will sometimes put a shot in my morning drip coffee just because. Now I buy the pods in a box of 150 on a subscription from Amazon and will never (or at least not for the time being) have to fear running out of espresso for my wife. We also have Smith Brothers deliver our milk and get these little half-pint school lunch type cartons of chocolate milk that is the perfect size for a mocha. I can crank out a consistently really good mocha in about three minutes with no muss or fuss at a unit cost of less 60 cents. It used to take me ten or fifteen minutes to get out the milk and hershey's chocolate and grind the beans, make the espresso (same three minutes) and then clean up this huge mess.

review/summary: Easy in, easy out, good price.
review/text: These make my morning latte so easy! I have only had my DeLonghi for a couple of months and I am no expert (at all, I mean it's just plain sad) with trying to get ground coffee tamped correctly to make a good cup of espresso. ESE pods for me are perfect - easy to put in, easy to take out, no mess, and no skill required. These Lavazza pods are admittedly not quite as good as Illy, but if you buy in the bulk box these are about 30 cents per unit. In contrast, Illy costs about $13 for a box of 18 pods... just too pricey for everyday drinking! And actually, I think that the Lavazza pods produce a better crema.<br /><br />Also, I feel inclined to mention that not only did I receive my pods with lots of shelf-life left (over a year), but all that I have used so far have been correctly tamped and produce a good, strong espresso.<br /><br />**Update 6 months later... I am loving these more and more. I could not live without them, they are so convenient! And I am just so pleased with the auto-ship program. I just received a new case and the expiry date is good into 2012 (received in Nov. 2010). Good job Lavazza, Good job Amazon!

review/text: These pods have the firmness of a teabag and it definitely shows in the cup.  I've made drip coffee thicker than this.  I've used Illy Dark and Starbucks ESE pods and they are 10 X better (especially Illy).  Both Illy and Starbucks are pre-tamped and firm as they should be.  Water rushes through these in about 5 seconds per shot versus 20-25 seconds per shot with the better pods I've used.  I thought I'd be safe ordering these considering they are probably Illy's number one competition but these were a major disappointment.<br />I called Amazon told them of my disappointment and I was taken care of great customer service!

That being said, this is the best price around for Lavazza ESE pods. A nice espresso without the harsh toast.

I changed my order to a subscription order and the significant savings makes this coffee even tastier! I use a Briel espresso machine and have only good things to say about these pods.

review/text: Lavazza Gran Crema pods can be coaxed into delivering powerful, smooth espresso, yielding a v good ratio of joy/$. I suspect the likers here are separated from the dislikers more by their equipment than their palates. In general, home machines with small baskets (55mm) probably work better with ESE pods than those that use professional-size baskets. In any case, before quitting on LGC pods, try this:<br /><br />1. Trim the paper 'ear' off the pod- it seems to offer water a too-easy, non-coffee route to the wall of the basket, instead of being driven down the middle where it belongs.<br /><br />2. Tamp, yes, but with pod OUTSIDE adapter basket, on tabletop, twisting back & forth a few times. These pods seem to be shaped slightly smaller in diameter than other ESE pods, & benefit from being 'mashed out' a bit (along with being compressed). Some [adapter+portafilter] combos do a good job of compressing pods into the grouphead, others need help.<br /><br />3. Improvise a pre-infusion cycle that allows the coffee to 'bloom' in water briefly before actually pulling the shot. (e.g., turn pump on 3 sec, off 6 sec, then shoot).<br /><br />I've just bought these, am still becoming familiar with their behavior. Have mostly been using them with Handpresso for milk-based drinks; to be fair, for straight espresso, there are other pods I prefer (so far). I'm getting 30ml (1oz) shots with nice, golden crema in 25-ish sec, same using Saeco Rio Vapore machine (small basket) & Gaggia Classic (pro-size), which is faster than I prefer when grinding/tamping myself. The flavor is deep, smooth, semisweet, truly Euro but somewhat underdeveloped, missing nuance I've found in espresso made (well) by a local Italian deli using Lavazza GC beans. Far from displeased, I'm delighted by the pleasure I can get with a 'minimalist' approach, & almost no cleanup. Very hi-Q packaging, expect solid shelf-life.

review/text: The price on Amazon for the box of 150 I ordered was a really great deal, however the flavor is not as intense as I would have liked it!

review/summary: Perfect every time
review/text: I have a Delonghi BAR32 espresso machine (about $90) and these pods produce fantastic espresso every time.  I put a pod in, make sure the little paper tab is folder over so the whole pod is in the pod adapter, tamp it down a little (I just use the built-in tamper on the Delonghi) and that's it...  20 seconds later I have a great cup of espresso with lots of crema.  I tried the Illy (black), but for 3x the price I actually think they make much worse espresso.  These Lavazza pods are cheap and work great.<br /><br />The only thing they could improve would be to make the pod wrappers recyclable.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: This is authentic espresso. The pods meet E.S.E. specs. Each pod comes individually packaged for freshness. I uses them with my Delonghi espresso make and my hand pump espresso maker as well.

review/summary: Excellent crema!
review/text: Excellent crema! There is good...then there is great but Lavazza is the ultimate best pod coffee for your lattes that you will ever find! Smoothdraw on the machne & verly sweet & nutty taste! I will use nothing else going forward!

review/summary: works well in my machine
review/text: I have a gaggia coffee deluxe espresso machine. At first I used starbucks pods and they didn't work very well. It took forever to get a shot. Started using these and they worked like a charm. Love the flavor also. Never realized how bitter the starbucks coffee was until I used these. Very smooth. Liked so much, starting using the subscribe and save program. Didn't give 5 stars because occasinally you can pull a watered down shot. Can't be sure if this is the pod or my espresso machine.

review/summary: Nice favor but poor tamping.
review/text: I too received a shipment of pods that are too loosely tamped. The water comes through much too fast. I have been using Starbucks and Illy for some time and they work perfectly.<br /><br />I did try the pre-wetting process and then tamping again but it's just too much trouble.<br /><br />The price is great but I just decided to go with a new Nespresso machine and wish I had done it sooner. 19 bars of pressure and even the milder lungo and decaf are wonderful!

review/summary: Simply terrible
review/text: Not only water rushes through these pods like Yosemite waterfall in April, creating a thinly watery cup, but the coffee itself is stale and tastes no better than it smells. It really feels as it was sitting in some forsaken warehouse for many (at least 2) years.<br />I am not very organized, and when I run out of my real espresso (and I am an addict) I have to resort to this... always with disgust...<br />Lavazza is usually decent coffee and #1 in Italy, but I can't imagine being served such an awful tasting cup in Venice or Rome.<br />So if this real Lavazza which I somehow doubt, it must be beyond product expiration date.<br />I wish I could get refund from Amazon for the worst product in any categories I have ever bought!
