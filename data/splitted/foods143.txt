review/summary: Good price, nice enough tea, not perfect
review/text: I go along with a number of reviewers that this isn't a very strong tea.  It has a nice mild malty taste that holds up to milk and sugar but if you try to get it to a strong malty taste it gets bitter.  But the price is good, it comes with rapid Amazon shipping, and it is better than anything from the grocery store.  And it is organic.  So, overall, I'm good with it.  For a bit more though you can get a stronger malty organic tea from one of the other on-line bulk tea stores.

review/summary: Quality control issues - Davidson's is a gamble
review/text: About 8 months ago I ordered a bag of English Breakfast from Davidson's and it was quite good.  Not the best but very good for the price.  After I ran out I decided to order two more bags of the English Breakfast and Assam Banaspaty.  To my great dissapointment, both are old and flavorless.  It seems like Davidson's did not store them properly.  They become bitter quickly if I brew them long enough to get any flavor out of them and I've resorted to mixing it with other tea just so it isn't a total waste.  The reality, is that I wasted $32 on tea that is only really good for making water brown.  : (<br /><br />The quality control issue and randomness of getting a good batch from Davidson's make it not a good value.  I'd rather pay more to know I'm getting consistent quality and not something that might be a total waste.<br /><br />I was really excited when I first discovered Davidson's because I drink a lot of tea and they have attractive pricing but my second order was such a huge let-down that they've lost me as a customer.

I highly recommend to a friend  --

review/text: I have been purchasing this tea regularly for a couple of years through Amazon's subscribe and save program. I have never been disappointed with it's quality. I am not a tea snob nor connoisseur of fine teas, so I don't look for the finest tea or even know how it compares with other teas. All I want is an affordable tea that tastes very good to me. Any extra quality would be wasted on me, so why pay more.  This loose tea certainly fits the bill, plus it beats all the store brand tea bag teas and actually works out to be cheaper than most if not all.

review/summary: A Mild-Mannered Bean-Intensive Lean Turkey Chili
review/text: I like all the varieties of Stagg Chili I have tried. They are always delicious, and there are varieties for every type of chili lover out there. "Turkey Ranchero" is a good alternative for those trying to cut fat from their diet. It's 98% fat free because the turkey is very lean. The flavor profile is pleasing, with nice paprika notes, but I could have used more jalapeno and generally stronger pepper flavors. The extremely lean and thick nature of this particular chili is also responsible for a drawback. The chili is advertised as "thick and hearty" and it is definitely part of a satisfying meal, however the combination of extremely thick viscosity combined with the ultra-lean turkey makes for some predictable problems for cooking, namely, the tendency is for this to stick badly to the pan, especially if overheated (I recommend medium heat at the most.) It is of crucial importance to stir this chili almost continuously when cooking or your pan will have a challenging to clean black charred residue on the bottom of it. Greasing the pan is an option, but can defeat the purposes of using lean meat in the first place if not careful. Do not get impatient: cooking this product slightly slower pays big dividends in the taste and cleanup departments.<br /><br />I really like Staggs' "Turkey Ranchero" and recommend it without hesitation; it has an enormous amount of beans, a very generous amount of turkey, and pleasant (though relatively mild) seasonings that most people will like (though I like to add red pepper flakes to mine.) A serving (two per can) has 19 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber, which for the hearty flavors makes the 5 grams of fat seem a reasonable tradeoff for most diets. Like any processed foods (and especially canned soups) the sodium levels are high at 790 mg per serving, so people on a restricted sodium diet should stay away.

review/summary: Good GF cookies
review/text: We can get these at our local store and tend to pick them up whenever we're shopping. They're great little cookies - not much bigger than a half-dollar coin. Just right when you need a quick bit of sweet taste but don't want something really big or rich. Our family is essentially gluten free, so ready made treats that actually taste good and that aren't grainy are great to have. By no means are these gourmet, but they're better than the pre-gluten free oreo or chips ahoy type pre-made cookies.<br /><br />They're free of most all common allergens, too - not just gluten.

A little bit of moisture would have gone a long way, and I'm experimenting with rehydrating them by putting a piece of lettuce in the bag overnight (in the fridge).  The results have been inconclusive as to whether this helps, with two of us having a split decision.  The teriyaki flavor is perfect...not too salty as I expected, and the taste, if rated separately gets 5 stars.

review/text: Although this is very expensive canned dog food we found it well worth the cost.  We own a Golden Retriever Saluki mix that is extremely particular about what she eats and she rarely accepts canned dog food. However, she loves the Weruva Bed and Breakfast. It is extremely moist and contains lots of broth in addition to the meats and vegetables that she likes best. We normally boil chicken, rice, carrots and broth and make her a stew that she eats with great enthusiasm.  Until I purchased this Weruva product I could find no canned dog food that came close to what we make her at home.  Weruva is almost exactly what we fix her. I have continued to use this product regularly.  It is the best canned dog food I have found.

Just visit their site and learn why they are the best and most caring in the pet food industry. Yes, their product comes from Thailand, a country that has more strict regulations when it comes to food production than the USA and Weruva is constantly auditing the Thailand food production to ensure they are nothing but the best quality and safety.<br /><br />Enough said. You want the best for your pet? Then spend the $4 a can for this unbelievable product. Expensive it is, but that's the cost of giving your loved on the best there is.

This organic Rooibos makes the perfect daily cup of tea that can be enjoyed in any quantity. African herbal tea is rich in many essential natural elements as it is not allowed to oxidize making the flavor more fruity and literally weightless. This tastes like a cross between soft black and green tea, a gorgeous pumpkin color when brewed and since it's caffeine free I can drink myself silly before bedtime and it has not kept me up yet. The subtle richness of soft pulpy mellow woods is silky with a pleasant sparkling green aftertaste which I find myself craving all the time.<br /><br />So far every flavor of Numi I have tired proved to be a winner and a cup of high quality in both flavor and taste is always guaranteed and only a short boil of water away. After a hectic day this is the best calming and tranquil beverage that is not only delicious but also so healthy!<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/summary: Herbal Alternative to Caffeinated Beverages, A Different Rooibos
review/text: *****<br /><br />Sweet African Green Rooibos Herbal Teasan is a delectable Numi tea.<br /><br />This tea is certified organic and kosher and contains only green rooibos and honeybush. It is from South Africa, made from the same plant as Rooibos (Red Tea), but it is not sun-dried, and it has more anti-oxidants than green tea. It is also rich in phytoestrogens. It has a light, smooth, eathy-woody taste.<br /><br />If you like Numi herbal teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you just want a tasty, high-quality rooibos tea, this one does not disappoint.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Morning fix!
review/text: I can't get enough of this tea.  It fills my go-mug every morning on the way to work, and warms me in those early winter meetings.<br /><br />This is a great alternative for people who can't drink camellia-based tea (green, black, white, conventional or decaf) or want a caffeine-free alternative.  It lacks the sharp bite of oxidized rooibos, but still has its fruity tones.  It's not so exotic that you'd get sick of it quickly; it's not so unremarkable that you don't care if you finish your mug.  It's just right.

review/summary: Awesome at a price
review/text: I was lucky enough to travel to Oz last November and filled half a suitcase with Aussie junk food (not the best thing for a diabetic, but you only live once!).<br /><br />Anyway, Cherry Ripe(s) are incredible, with a cherry taste and a texture similar to a Mounds bar. Of course, we don't get these in the States. Why? Who knows? I couldn't find any Diet Dr. Pepper or Diet A&W Root Beer to save my life over there, so it may be a cultural thing.<br /><br />The price seems pretty steep for a candy bar, so you might see if you have any candy specialty shops (even ones that are labeled as being British) where you live before ordering. I know I could find 'American' candy over there, but you pay a hefty price for it.

review/summary: Delicious! And better value than the six-pack of full sized bars
review/text: For those of you not familiar with the cherry ripe, the filling is a dried and slightly candied mince of cherries and coconut. This is coated with a thin outer layer of dark chocolate. They are extremely popular in Australia, where I live, and are in fact one of the classic candy bars we all grew up with. These things are delicious, so if they don't sell them where you are and you have a yen to try another culture's junk food, let me say cherry ripes are a pretty good choice.<br /><br />Unusually, on a per gram basis I'm pretty sure this bag of "fun sized" bars offers better value than the only other way I can see of buying cherry ripes on amazon - the six pack of full sized bars. That works out at over $3.32 a bar. But hey, amazon's prices do fluctuate considerably over time, so it might be worth your while to check my figures. They may well be out of date by the time you're reading this.<br /><br />Theo.

My dogs loved the Loving Pet Sticks but when I read they were made in China, I threw them away and refuse to buy Loving Pet's many other products until they are made in the US. As for these Barksters, they are made with only four ingredients and all are healthy ingredients. All of my picky Chihuahua's love the treats, or I should say they loved the crumbs. I rated these healthy treats 3 stars instead of 4 stars because the crisps were all broken up and were in crumbs.

review/text: I love these healthy dog treats. My dog has trouble with a lot of processed dog foods and treats. These are a great way to give her a little something extra when she's a good girl and not have to worry if she will get sick or have an allergic reaction. I will warn you, though, they often arrive broken in pieces, even though they are packed fairly well. They are very delicate, crispy treats. I usually break them down into pieces anyway, so it isn't much of a drawback for me, but it may bother some of you.

review/summary: My Dogs Love These!
review/text: Ok, let's be honest. "Dogs will be dogs" and mine love just about anything edible,  but they go absolutely bonkers for these little crisps.  I feel good about giving them these as snacks or for training, for a few reasons.<br /><br />First, just like the box says they're "guilt-free"; made with brown rice and beef, they're wheat & gluten free, low fat and only 12 calories per treat -- so I feel good about not giving them "junk food", per se.<br /><br />Second, they're light & crispy -- like a puffed rice, so the pups aren't being weighed down by a heavy dog biscuit full of corn & sugar.  Lastly, the dogs REALLY like/crave these, so they've been a great tool for training, when I use the crisps as a positive reinforcement for good behavior.  When I'm doing repetitive action training over & over again (like teaching my one dog how to shake), I'd rather give him 10 of these than 10 pieces of hot dog or chemical-laden mushy dog snacks.  These brown rice & beef Barksters accomplish both of our needs and I'm actually rewarding him with something good for his body and his spirit.

review/summary: My Maggie Lives for Her Treatie-Time
review/text: My Maggie L-I-V-E-S for Her Treatie Time<br /><br />Every evening, after the dogs have eaten and played outside until bedtime, it turns into "Treatie-Time." Both of my girls, Lucille and Maggie, are allowed two treats, or sometimes three each if they really beg. They have to sit or down or do something special to "earn" their treatie, but it's a special time for us.<br /><br />I value my dog's health, as I'm sure you do. I want them to live a long time and have a trouble-free existence - no scratchy skin allergies, etc. Therefore, I've explored using organic treats, and have even purchased some expensive ones from a local dog bakery. I must tell you that the "girls" were underwhelmed with those treats. Despite their healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Therefore, when I was approached to review the new brand of organic treats for Barksters, I was ambivalent. Organic treats haven't been very well received in my household in the past, but I was game to try them again.<br /><br />I believe in organic treats, but if the girls don't eat them, it's really money down the drain. Especially since we're not depending upon the treats for total nutrition, I'm also concerned with treats being of the the low-calorie variety. I was horrified to learn that one of the standard biscuit-y treats contained over 500 calories in each one. That's terrible.<br /><br />As I opened the two packages of Barksters, one was Sweet Potato and Chicken Krisps and the other was Brown Rice and Beef Krisps, I was glad to see two things on the packaging:<br /><br />1.The treats are made in the good ole' U.S. of America. This is important, especially because of the recent pet deaths from pet food manufactured in China.<br /><br />2.The treats are wheat free and gluten free.<br /><br />The second is most important for my "grand-dog" Dutchy, the Siberian Husky. Ever since he's been a pup he's struggled with digestive issues. Our vet recommended that he have a gluten-free diet, which has helped him tremendously. We don't want to ruin his digestion with treats.<br /><br />As we spent the afternoon on the deck on a steamy Georgia Sunday afternoon, I broke out the two types of treats to see what the doggy reactions would be. I was surprised to see that the treats reminded me of rice cakes - very puffy - and wafer-like, instead of a biscuit. And, I must say that they were both a great hit with all the dogs. They couldn't get enough of them.<br /><br />The wafers tended to break, but that allowed me to give smaller treats more often to the group. They didn't mind if it was broken in two, that just meant two treats - Bonus!<br /><br />The treats cost approximately $10 per box which contained 5 ounces, which seems pricey. But, since it's a "luxury" item, I can go with the price. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the dogs liked these treats, especially since they didn't look like the ones they're used to getting for their "treatie-time."<br /><br />I'd highly recommend that you try Barksters!

review/summary: Amazing dog treat.
review/text: Our dogs love Barksters (all varieties), so when my friend needed to potty train her new rescue dog I recommended them to her.  They worked like a charm!  Since they only have 12 calories and can be broken into smaller bits, she could give a piece every time the dog went out.  It's hard to describe their texture.  They are puffed and crispy, but not fried.  They are crinkly like a potato chip but much thicker.  The best part is that they are all natural...oh, and made in America!

It's a 6-pack of 25g bags, 150g TOTAL<br /><br />So you're getting about the equivalent of one bag of chips for your money. Still, not a terrible deal for something a little exotic.<br /><br />The chips themselves were good, though! I only took stars off for the somewhat deceptive descriotion and the fact it took a couple of weeks for them to arrive.

review/summary: Great Flavor, Better for the Earth
review/text: I like to support companies who strive harder to help the earth.  Newman's Own Organic French Roast Coffee is fair-trade organic coffee.  That means the coffee farmers are compensated fairly and the coffee is certified organic, which is better for us and the earth.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />This is a dark roast coffee, but it doesn't taste overly dark.  It has no bitterness, which is great, and is fairly smooth.  It lacks the complexity in flavor that other coffees can have, but it still tastes good.  It's a nice cup of coffee, and even if you don't care for dark roast, you may find you like this one.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black, and this is a great coffee to do so.  However, adding flavored creamers would also taste pretty good.  Sometimes I add ground cinnamon to the coffee grounds in the basket, so it brews into the coffee.  That yields a nice, mild cinnamon flavor to the coffee.<br /><br />AROMA:<br />The aroma coming from brewing this coffee is very tantalizing.  It is warm and almost has a sweet scent to it.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />The bag folds up and has a couple of arms which fold around the sides to keep it closed.  It stays pretty fresh that way.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I find this to be one of my lesser favorites in the coffee world, but it is still a good one.  If you desire to work towards dark roast coffees, this would be a good one to start with.  Or, if you desire a milder dark roast, again, a good one here.

review/text: Im up early at 5a.m. getting ready for class..i dont have time to make a big breakfast so these oatmeal packets are very convinient for me. Ofcourse the fiber in the oatmeal keeps you full for awhile wich is a good thing because i dont get to get a real meal until about 10:30 a.m. and this helps to suppress the hunger. Plus these are original so NO SUGAR ADDED...just oatmeal. I highly recommend this product for anybody whos up early and on the move and needs a quick meal to keep your hunger down.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: These are the normal sized packets that we all know and love.  Good ol' Regular flavor so it doesn't have all that extra sugar and stuff.  I use 2 packets and about 3/4 cup water.  Just boil the water first in the microwave, then dump it into the bowl which has the oatmeal and sugar and butter.. stir... let it sit for a minute...  makes Breakfast in just a few minutes.  This box has 48 packets so you will have enough to last you a long time!<br /><br />For me, oatmeal does't get better than this (Quaker brand / Regular flavor).  So go for it, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Great Mix for Fruit Varieties..
review/text: On most days I'll have a couple packets of Quaker Oatmeal (any fruit variety) for breakfast with my morning coffee. The only drawback to this is the fact that most of the flavored varieties of Quaker Oatmeal are loaded with sugar. I've started mixing one packet flavored oatmeal with one packet original flavor. This immediately cuts my morning sugar intake in half, extends the time between purchasing the more expensive flavored packets and I still get the fiber from the fruity flavors I love.<br /><br />Please rate this review if you found it helpful.

Perfect before bed.<br /><br />PROS<br />+Value (Amazon offers a consistent solid value on Yogi teas).<br />-Tastes amazing with Stevia.<br />+Great post-dinner treat.<br /><br />CONS<br />+Herbal tea versus green tea, some may argue the benefits are greater from green tea, but I love the taste of this tea, so I tent to drink it more making it more beneficial in my eyes.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />If your thinking about ordering this tea, grab some Stevia to go with it (I would recommend KAL brand, known to have less aftertaste) and you like peppermint and licorice, order this tea! Brew yourself a cup of tea, and add one to three servings of Stevia depending on the size, and enjoy!

This tea also has cinnamon which is not in the Aveda tea at all. Overall, I would NOT recommend this tea to anyone who is looking for Aveda tea. It is very minty and has cinnamon in it.

review/text: This salt is seriously fantastic. Lots of folks say there isn't a difference in taste from salt to salt. IMO, not true. Natural salt has minerals going for it that may make it milder than old fashioned sodium chloride. I'm sure all this can be debated.<br /><br />This Maldon (aka English Sea Salt) is super chunky and crunchy. It's milder than normal salt, IMO and tastes great on just about everything. Also, "milder" doesn't mean "add more salt". I like to use this as a finishing salt to add a flavorful crunch to pan fried asparagus with black pepper and garlic, or sprinkle lightly on meats just before serving. Also is perfect for a coarse, dry herb rub for chicken.

review/text: Slate Magazine has a review on table salts and this was the winner.  So I ordered some from Amazon and compared it myself to the brands available where I live, including Celtic Sea Salt.  There is no comparison... Maldon is the standout winner. It is big flaky, crunchy pieces of very tasty salt.  This is not a baking salt.  It is more of a finishing salt to go "on" foods.  It's wonderful on avocado, steamed yellow squash, baked potatoes... etc.  The Slate reviewer said he loved it the best on chocolate H&auml;agen-Dazs ice cream!  It's that good.

It's a complete waste to cook with it, plus it's hard to come up with equivalent measures if you were to use it when cooking in place of kosher or table salt.  But sprinkled on a rib eye fresh off the grill, on a pan seared salmon filet just before you serve it, on roasted aspargus right out of the oven, or even over a fresh, crisp apple half - it's "Na" heaven! If you already use finishing salts, you know what difference they can make. And if you're not, it's an easy way to take your dishes to the next level. Bon appetite!

Do't worry too much about the price, because this will last you a good long time. You only use it for finishing at the table, not for cooking (cheaper kosher is the this for that), so you only use a pinch at a time.<br /><br />I get it locally from Whole Foods which, ironically, has a really good price; for folks who don't live near a store that carries Maldon, this is a good deal!

review/text: I discovered Maldon salt about 10 years ago, ever since it is a must in my kitchen. As a man who cooks a homemade meal every single day, this salt is outstanding when used with meats or fish. It will exponentially improve the flavor while adding a few notes of its own. Absolutely recommendable, especially at the affordable price Amazon is offering. Don't use this salt in salads and similar dishes, since once it dissolves you will not notice much of a difference with other salts (there will be, it will just not be as pronounced). Just cook your meats or fish and then I suggest adding a spoon of extra virgin olive oil, then sprinkle a little bit of Maldon salt. You will not regret it.

review/summary: Finest
review/text: Maldon salt is acknowledged to be the most elegant salt made. Irregular flakes make it ideal for finishing although it would be something of a waste to dissolve it in cooking. The flakes provide a 'surprise' when you encounter them, rather than an all-over saltiness. For another dimension, I recommend trying the smoked Maldon salt. The smoke flavor is much more subtle than the aroma.<br /><br />Maldon flakes occupy one end of the spectrum...very clean and balanced, while a good Fleur de Sel adds it's own flavors due to the microorganisms contained in it. Again, it is for finishing and would be a waste for cooking. Both represent the epitome of sea salts.<br /><br />No other sea salts are in the running. Those red and black salts (colored with clay) are no more than novelty products manufactured for a curious public.

I seldom use salt while cooking (except where it makes a real difference such as baking); instead I provide a small wooden bowl of Maldon at the dinner table as a finishing salt. Years ago a friend shared a conversation she and her husband had on their way home from dinner at our house: Husband asked why food at our home always tasted so good; wife replied "well, it may begin with the salt and pepper "gingergal" uses! Enough said.

review/summary: Maldon Salt Rocks!
review/text: OK, we tend to think salt is salt is salt, however, I had the great fortune to go to a wonderful restaurant in Barcelona, called Osmosis (check it out if you are in BCN and reserve a table, you won't regret it); as a starter, we were given Catalan bread with a local olive oil and three different types of salt - Baltic, Australian and Maldon.  Maldon was the fave of all of three of us - it has an amazing balance and you don't feel you've consumed too much salt, which couldn't be said for the other salts we sampled. I'm buying this 'coz my teenage daughter, who was at the restaurant with me, enjoyed the salt so much (and we are a virtually salt-free family) she feels we need to have this as a staple in our home!

review/text: This salt is good for putting on top of focaccia.  It looks good and has a nice crunch without getting a "rock" in your mouth.

review/summary: Puts The Sea in Sea Salt
review/text: I really thought I would love this salt;  I really tried to love this salt:  I am just not a big fan of this salt.  This salt puts the Sea in Sea Salt (more so than other sea salts) -and for me that equates to a C in flavor.  I really get an 'ocean aftertaste' that I do not care for.  Perhaps this salt would go well with sea food, but since I don't eat a lot of sea food it is not for me.  Another disappointment for me is the loss of crunchiness when this salt touches anything moist;  other salts seem to be able to hold onto their crunch a little better.  I will raise this review if I find a food that embraces this salt's uniqueness to my liking.

review/summary: So Good!
review/text: I bought Maldon Sea Salt after a friend mentioned how good it was.  I can't believe the difference between it and other salts.  The crunchy texture and the clean taste makes it perfect for everything from steak to a baked potato to desserts.  It is and will be a permanent fixture on our table from now on.
