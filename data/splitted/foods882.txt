review/summary: cat food
review/text: My cats love "wild" foods. I had been getting this locally but then it got harder to find. I was surprised and glad when I found it on line at Amazon. This is a treat for the cats, but one I will continue to purchase.<br />Texture is solid, but moist, not like some cans that are all gravy.<br />Venison is probably the favorite between Rabbit, Venison and Duck.

review/summary: Double Yum!
review/text: Where have these been all my life? They are a little expensive, but a great way to treat yourself. Buying through Amazon is cheaper than buying online from Godiva directly. I can't find the Dark Chocolate Caramel Gems in grocery stores near my house. The local grocery store carries the Milk Chocolate Caramel Gems, but I think that they are too sweet. I like the balance of the dark chocolate, which is a thinner layer than I have found in other brands. And the caramel is just the right tenderness. I'm hooked.

review/text: I was feeding a very high quality food, but something in it was bothering my 2 oldest Cavaliers.  They were getting grumbly stomachs too often for my liking (about twice a week or so).  So I started looking for another food with a smaller ingredient panel and lower fat, higher fiber.  I also use canned and dry.  I remembered that I had used Mulligan Stew cans in the past and the dogs loved it and did very well on it, so I started researching the food and company to see if I felt they met my standards as a trustworthy company.  I love the science behind the food.  They don't use any synthetic vitamins/minerals and after finding out that they use no Asian sourced ingredients, the kibble is baked so it's more digestible, the ingredient panel for both kibble and canned is smaller, and the company representative Diane was a dream to work with and very knowledgable I decided to order a 5lb. bag to try (I used an amazon gift card I had).  When the bag came, I transitioned them immediately (using probiotics and enzymes to help).  It went great!  I still used the Fromm Gold canned food (until I could order in some Mulligan Stew cans) and the Mulligan Stew dry.  They ate it like candy!  I couldn't wait to see if the grumbly stomachs continued and if their stool looked okay.  Well, after about 4 days they've not had a stomach episode at all, their stool is normal, they eat it up like it's candy and my oldest Cavalier is actually acting a little more lively.  I'm sure her stomach was hurting before.  Needless to say, I'm ordering a larger order of the kibble and some cases of the canned.  Mulligan Stew seems to be the ticket for my dogs' good health.  Thanks!

review/text: Finding a gluten free gravy mix that is easy to use was not that easy, but we have finally found it with this product! I wish I could get it in less than packs of 8 as it lasts forever. We are not vegetarian so I mix it with drippings, broth/stock, and sometimes milk for a creamier texture. Also works with just water, but not as yummy. Super easy - just measure liquids add mix and heat and stir.

review/summary: Great tasting organic GF Vegetarian Gravy!
review/text: My son and I made this gravy to go over some rice and chicken breasts. We don't eat vegetarian, but I need to eat GF and we do eat organic. This gravy was so simple to make. You just add 1.5 tablespoons to two cups of water and bring to a boil. This mix produces the nicest, non-lumpy, tastiest gravy ever! The rest of the family had no idea it was vegetarian or GF. In fact, I had to make more gravy because everyone liked it so much. The boxes that come in your order will last a long time (26 servings per box). For the price and taste, this gravy is a great deal! Order some today.

review/summary: Great alternative!
review/text: I bought this for my son's new GFCF diet. He is a very picky eater and I was desperate for a gravy that he could eat with his rice or potatoes and this is it! The first time I made it for him, I made this type and our regular quick jarred gravy for the rest of the family, assuming this wouldn't be very good or "what we were used to". ALL of us liked this gravy so much better! We were pleasantly surprised. Now, it's never going to be as good as "real" fat gravy you can make, but if you think the regular powdered or jar gravy is pretty good, and are opting for healthier options, then the smoky, meaty flavor this gravy gives (WITHOUT the MEAT) really is good. We are now going to eat this in place of our 'regular' gravy. Oh, and this Amazon bulk order is huge - you should be set for life - but a great price!

The elk rack is realy an excellent product in and of it self, but when you add the cost o f the product and the shipping it is way too expensive. So I checked around both on line and off-line. I found many other sites and places which have the same produc at a much more reasonable cost. So much for believing that Amazon offered a good value. Hope you find this informative.

review/summary: Love those Poppers!
review/text: Several companies now have products called Chicken Poppers.  However, what I like about these is that they aren't at all greasy.  I have to be careful what I give my dogs because one gets Pancreatitis very easily and the other is a little piggy so I have to watch how much he eats.  These are a great size to satisfy without overdoing it.  And they are especially crunchy so the pups really enjoy them.  I'm sure they taste quite good as well, considering how quickly the little popper disappears.

I am not sure if it's because of the air pressure that it actually bursts through, but it leaks, not that much though.  Overall, they do try to super pack it to avoid leaks, but still happens.  It's not like a lot of the product leaks but it makes the rest of the packaging sticky.  Make sure you are close to a sink when you are ready to open yours :-)<br /><br />Hope this helps.

Secondly, they seal it the best they can, but these little containers tend to leak--not a lot, just at a nuscience level.  Lastly--this is Amazon's fault--I arranged per their automatic delivery plan to get shipments every two months.  That will not be often enough and I absolutely can not figure out how to change it.  I wonder if it is even possible.  Perhaps they will be mailing them the rest of my life at 2 month intervals!

review/summary: Excellent all-natural dog food
review/text: We have a GSP and Lhasa Apso - two very different dogs with 2 very different taste buds and both of them love this dog food. However, I don't buy it on Amazon since they don't have free shipping. It's cheaper at the pet store (around $23 for a case of 12). The only downfall to this dog food is that the cans do not have a flip-top to open them - you need a can opener. However, I'm ok with that if both my dogs enjoy it and they do. Plus, it's very good quality food for them - I mix it in with the dry Eagle dog food.

review/text: I'm normally a very healthy yet picky eater.  These soy crisp are really delicious.  They look like little rice cakes, yet pack the taste of a potato chip.  I absolutely love snacking on them and with the serving size being 20 for at about 110 calories, that makes it even better.

review/summary: Low Fat and Few Calories (HEALTHY SNACK); Great Taste
review/text: Glenny's Low Fat Soy Crisps are a healthy snack and I absolutely love them.  Trying to be health conscious and trying to avoid fats, I was looking for snacks that would satisfy both requirements.  I stumbled on these snacks at two (2) places: Dean's Natural Foods stores and Whole Foods.<br /><br />Be careful that you only select the Glenny's that say Low Fat on the label. Why? This is important if you are trying to cut fat out of your diet as well as calories.  There are no saturated fats nor any trans fats nor any cholesterol in the low fat Glennys.  There is only one gram of fat per serving.  And the calorie count is extremely low (only 70 calories per serving) versus for the regular Glennys over 110 to 120 calories per serving.<br /><br />The taste is great and for those who need a crunchy snack sometime during the day; this is a healthy alternative to potato chips or pop corn.  Two small servings which would only be 140 calories and 0 saturated fat would provide you with 10 grams of soy protein, 25 mg of soy isoflavones, 3 grams of dietary fiber and more soy protein than tofu or soy milk.<br /><br />Cosmopolitan Magazine quotes: "Even better than potato chips. Delicious."<br /><br />Additionally, each serving gives you 4% of your daily calcium requirement and 8% of your iron percent daily value. Each serving would be about 10 chips approximately.  I open the 3 ounce bag and separate the contents into ziplock bags (10 chips apiece) so that I can regulate the calories and the amount of fat in my snacks.<br /><br />What is nice for those who are afraid to buy a 3 ounce bag of anything.  Even if you succumbed to eating the entire 3 ounce bag: all would not be lost.  You would be getting 20 grams of protein, 50 mg or soy isoflavones, 6 grams of dietary fiber and 300 calories total in the whole bag.  The taste is great whether you purchase the low fat apple cinnamon, the white cheddar or the lightly salted, the low fat barbeque...all have a great taste.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this snack..great taste.<br /><br />Sample a bag.  I think you will be a fan after that.<br /><br />There are 1.3 ounce bags (which are being offered on Amazon) which are even better than the 3 ounce (85 gram) bags (for those who are concerned about their will power) that I have been purchasing.  You have the bags already divided into individual snack portions with 24 bags in the pack.  Terrific alternative.  This particular selection is for a six pack of the 3.5 ounce bags which I have been purchasing at my local natural food stores.<br /><br />Note: The White Cheddar is my personal favorite of the lightly salted, barbeque and white cheddar LOW FAT selections.  Although all are crunchy and good tasting.  MAKE SURE TO SELECT THE WHITE CHEDDAR VARIETY THAT STATES LOW FAT ON THE BAG COVER (THIS SELECTION IS 70 CALORIES PER SERVING VERSUS 110!)..GLENNY'S HAS TWO DIFFERENT WHITE CHEDDAR PRODUCT OFFERINGS..ALWAYS CHECK THE CALORIES AND THE PER SERVING NUTRITIONAL VALUES.<br /><br />Bentley/October 2007

review/text: Glennys organic soy crisps have always been my favorite brand until the last few times I've ordered the 6 pack from amazon.  The crisps are overcooked and have a burnt flavorless taste to them. I wind up throwing out most of the bags because they taste like cardboard. I'm given up on Glenny's organic crisps.

review/summary: The Glenny's "Lightly Salted" Chips Are Great, But the "Sea Salt" Chips Taste Funky
review/text: I've been enjoying the Glenny's Lightly Salted chips for several years.  They're great.  They're hard to get in the supermarket, so I buy them by the case from Amazon .  (Sometimes they're hard to get from Amazon, too.)<br /><br />I thought I'd give the Glenny's Sea Salt chips a taste.  Blech.  It has a funky taste.  "Salt is salt," I thought.  I don't know if it's only the taste of the different salt that makes the chip taste funky, or if they make that variety of the chip differently in other ways.<br /><br />I trashed the entire case of the Sea Salt chip, and went back to the Lightly Salted variety.<br /><br />"To each, his own taste."

review/text: Folks, maybe it's because I'm not use to eating horrendously healthy snacks - but these truly reminded me of cardboard covered in cheap powdered flavorings.  And one thing I learned the hard way - food items are not returnable, even though they are in sealed bags.  So now I'm stuck with 24 bags.  And my daughter, who eats horrendously healthy (soy, tofu, etc), won't even go near them.  She also thinks they resemble cardboard.

review/summary: High in protein and tastes great!
review/text: I was so shocked to see that there were 7 grams of protein in serving of these chips that were only 80 calories.  This is really impressive, since most protein bars that pack similar amounts of protein are way more calorie rich and packed with a lot more sugar and fat.  I compared these soy chips with the PowerBar ProteinPlus High Protein Bars and here are the stats if you were to eat 3 servings of these chips (to get comparable protein amounts):<br /><br />Glenny's vs Powerbar:<br />21 g protein vs 23 g protein<br />240 cals vs 290 cals<br />0 g sat fat vs 3.5 g sat fat<br />3 g fiber vs 2 g fiber<br />27 g carbs vs 37 g carbs<br /><br />So the powerbar has 2 more grams of protein, but is 50 more calories and tons more carbs.<br />On top of that the chips taste great and are perfect if you love crunchy, savory, carby stuff but still want to get that protein.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />--Don't worry, I don't work for them, I just did all these calculations because I literally could not believe the protein content in these considering they are also low fat, low carb and low cal as well.  Why doesn't this get any more cred?

review/text: I have long been an avid fan of Glenny's products.  Unfortunately, the two stores in my hometown that carried Clenny's Soy Crisps stopped carrying them.  That's when I turned to Amazon.com, from whom I ended up ordering from six to twelve bags of nearly each flavor.  They arrived at my door so quickly (in only two or three days, despite the prediction of more than a week) that I was completely astonished.  For people who are on Weight Watchers, they can eat twice as many of these crisps than they can other similar products for the same number of points.  The crisps are a delectable alternative to crackers and chips, and in lieu of croutons, I have crumbled them into salads as well.  I have even melted fat free cheese on them.  They are worth the money and the few days' wait.

review/text: My kids love these.  My hubby and I love these.  The reviews are mixed on sour to sweet.  To us they are sweet, but more like licorice sweet.  There is nothing sour about them, unless you like really sweet things.  As for the apples as the main ingredient.  Yep, they are apples and apple juice.  So.  It is good for you.  It is 'junk food' and something quick to grab as you head out the door.  Are they sticky, yes, if you grab them and lick them and drool all over them.  However, my five yr old can eat one without getting all sticky and he is not exactly coordinated.  My two yr old, well, that is what baby wipes are for.<br /><br />If you want something quick, convenient, and healthy - this is it.<br />If you want something perfectly suited to you - try them not in bulk first.<br />If you want something neat - don't give them to a two yr old.

review/text: I eat mustard on my sandwiches pretty much daily and I prefer stone ground or coarse/whole grain to regular yellow mustard.  I hadn't tried this brand before but I noticed the salt-free version of this mustard got very good reviews.  The price was right compared to what I'd pay in a grocery store so I went ahead and gave it a shot.<br /><br />It's quite tasty; it gives you a nice amount of mustard flavor on a sandwich without overpowering the other ingredients.  It spreads nicely, as well.<br />It leans slightly towards the vinegary side like most stone ground mustards, and if you want something with more of a kick (like on a hot dog, for instance) it's probably not for you.  For a sandwich, though, it's excellent.<br /><br />The 12-pack does give you a substantial amount of mustard but the pack I got does not expire for well over a year.  If you eat mustard regularly you shouldn't have any problems making your way through it.

review/text: I bought these chocolates because my gf loves dark chocolate and coconut. When I saw this product, I thought it would be the perfect fit for a Valentine's Day gift. I'd read some reviews about some of Scott's Cakes' other chocolates being too hard to chew so I was a little hesitant, but decided to try these anyway.<br /><br />I think some people have the wrong expectations about chocolate coming through the mail. It seems like these people want something warm and chewy, but that's not going to work unless you're a fan of melted chocolate. These things are in transit for a few days, of course they're going to be a *little* tough.<br /><br />And that's what these chocolates were: a little tough. Not even close to a jawbreaker. Probably not even tougher than chewable airheads. However they were absolutely delicious! I was expecting to get a jawbreaker and instead I got a chocolate that was extremely tasty and felt like it was firm enough to withstand being in transit for a few days. I liked them even more than my gf did!<br /><br />Don't be discouraged by what some reviewers are saying, just try it yourself and remember to keep some reasonable expectations.

review/summary: delicious and well made
review/text: I bought these chocolates because my gf loves dark chocolate and coconut. When I saw this product, I thought it would be the perfect fit for a Valentine's Day gift. I'd read some reviews about some of Scott's Cakes' other chocolates being too hard to chew so I was a little hesitant, but decided to try these anyway.<br /><br />I think some people have the wrong expectations about chocolate coming through the mail. It seems like these people want something warm and chewy, but that's not going to work unless you're a fan of melted chocolate. These things are in transit for a few days, of course they're going to be a *little* tough.<br /><br />And that's what these chocolates were: a little tough. Not even close to a jawbreaker. Probably not even tougher than chewable airheads. However they were absolutely delicious! I was expecting to get a jawbreaker and instead I got a chocolate that was extremely tasty and felt like it was firm enough to withstand being in transit for a few days. I liked them even more than my gf did!<br /><br />Don't be discouraged by what some reviewers are saying, just try it yourself and remember to keep some reasonable expectations.

review/text: I drink Iron goddess oolong pretty often, it is actually my favorite tea and I have a yixing teapot dedicated to it.  The last batch of IG oolong I ordered did not satisfy as much as this has, and if memory serves it might have been more expensive.  When you order this tea you get a seal-able pouch that contains more than enough oolong to get you through a few months if you are a daily drinker like me.  The tea has a toasty flavor and is not particularly astringent.  The tea is very pleasant and you get a great deal of it for your money.

review/summary: Best gluten-free linguine
review/text: Ancient Harvest quinoa linguine is a good gluten-free substitute for gluten-based linguine. This corn-quinoa blend looks like gluten-based linguine when cooked, and while not the same as gluten-based, the texture is much better than most rice-based pastas - it doesn't have an al dente bite, but it does twirl up on a fork, if not overcooked.  The flavor is not typical of linguine, but it's also not off-flavored - it's neutral-flavored and pairs well with red sauces, and is also acceptable with delicate or mild sauces.  To prevent the pasta from sticking or clumping, follow the directions, and in addition, stir the water while adding the pasta, so that it doesn't have the chance to stick together.  For those on gluten-free diets, this quinoa linguine is the closest I've tasted to gluten-based and can be served to the whole family without complaint.<br />Ancient Harvest quinoa linguine is organic, made in the USA, and manufactured in a gluten-free facility.<br />Each serving has 205 calories, 46 g carbs, 4 g protein, 1 g fat, 4 mg sodium, 0 mg cholesterol.<br />Ingredients: organic corn flour, organic quinoa flour.

I've even got my boyfriend hooked on it, both of us maintaining that it even tastes better than normal pasta and whole wheat pasta.  I think the trick to making sure the texture of this pasta is al dente is to cook it for a shorter period of time than recommended on the box.  I think they suggest 10minutes, I always cook mine for 8 minutes.

review/text: I grew up in an Italian household. Pasta was the staff of life. Being a celiac, not a good thing. So, I'm grateful for this linguine. It's the best I've tried of the gluten free stuff. No, it's not indistinguishable from normal noodles, and it can't hold a candle to my home-made pasta, but it's good enough to eat. It's not cheap, even in quantity it costs at least three times as much as wheat pasta,  but that's still doable, and the alternative of never having a dish of linguine with clam sauce, or my home made red sauce, well, I'll wince and pay.

review/summary: Best GF pasta on the market!
review/text: After trying many other brands, we found Ancient Harvest linguini! Finally, a gluten-free pasta that doesn't stick, clump or disintegrate. The pricing on Amazon is about 60 cents better per box than any grocery-store pricing I've seen. We cook two boxes for our family of five and have less than one serving left over. We also love the elbow noodles. The spaghetti is passable, but the consistency of the linguini is better, in my opinion. If you eat gluten free, this pasta is for you!
