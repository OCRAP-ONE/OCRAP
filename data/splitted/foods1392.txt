review/summary: Good Stuff From a Chili Head
review/text: I was pretty leary considering this is a no meat product.  I have been making my own chili since I was in my 20s and am not a vegetarian.  This chile is very good for a canned chili and I have tried almost every brand.  I really had a hard time believing this was vegan and organic to boot.  The Tofu "meat" really makes it seem like "real" Chili.  I highly recommend this<br />Will

review/summary: Can you say sweet
review/text: I think that this chili is an aquired taste. The first time was ugh, gonna have to throw these away. The second time eating it was better. I think this could be a really good product if they dropped the sugar content down. The spicyness is a good warm feel. but not take your breathe away hot by any means. It was also a little thinner than I had hoped for, I tend to like my chili thicker so it stays piled up on a spoon. Overall the taste of the spices were pretty good, except for the sugar of course.

review/summary: Tasty, though a bit pricey
review/text: This chili is pretty tasty, and it's a great option for people who are vegetarian or vegan but who don't have the time, skills, or desire to cook for themselves.  I wouldn't describe this chili as spicy, but I think that's might be more of a personal taste.  My one qualm is that this chili is a bit expensive at about $3.00/can.  When I bought the case at Costco, it was probably about a dollar cheaper per can, but overall a decent value, as one can=one meal for me.

review/summary: The Best in The West
review/text: Admit it: during finals, when the baby will not stop crying, or when you are moving into a new place, you may want to avoid cooking at almost all costs. You want to avoid using the microwave sometimes too. You may not even have a microwave unpacked, or if you step away the baby will scream again. You may not believe in a microwave and cannot bring yourself to throw a pot on the stove for times sake. I am familiar with all of these situations, yes I am even a mom and a late start student. And you probably have been in a similar, if not the same, situation. In my personal opinion, this chili is good enough to eat from the can. Strangely, during this semesters finals, I found that experience moving enough to bring me in to write a review. This chili perfect, in my Californian opinion. I would say the best in the west, it is organic, spicy, perfectly sweet, and made just north of me in Petaluma. Come on now, this is what I will want to eat when the next natural disaster hits. This is what I will keep sitting in the back and not mind if it is 10 years old, canned food has that secret 30 year shelf life, and I will eat this. This is it :) Okay, sounds a little too passionate, but I am a big Amy's fan. The can liner has brought up debate, but the canned foods are the only ones with any form of BPA. Frankly, at least they are upfront about it. The rest of the products have not had the issue. By now the BPA may not even be in there, the issue is some years old now. Good and bad things considered, I still buy this chili. I love it!

review/summary: The only chili I haven't liked...
review/text: Hi!<br /><br />I'm easy to please when it comes to chili. I've enjoyed everything from cartons of Wendy's fast food chili to home-made gourmet vegetarian chili. In fact: until now, I thought it was near to impossible for me to be unsatisfied by anything even approximating a chili. This afternoon, I was craving a bowl but also felt to lazy to make up a batch of my own. As I've been pleased by many Amy's products in the past, I thought I'd spring for a can of spicy Amy's chili. Well, that was a mistake! I was grossly unsatisfied by a chili. Its spicy and also sweet, and not much else. The only reason that I finished my bowl was because I hate throwing food away. I'm starting to think that sugar is the secret ingredient in a lot of Amy's products (at least with this chili and a lot of their soups: especially tomato), and given the nature of the product I find that deeply frustrating! Obviously I am in the minority by disliking this chili, given the many positive reviews, but you may not want to buy a lot of it until you know you like it!<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Ryan

review/summary: Tastes good, but BPA is a dangerous toxin
review/text: This product contains BPA, which is known to be very dangerous to health. The following is a quote from the Wikipedia article on BPA:<br /><br />"Bisphenol A is an endocrine disruptor, which can mimic the body's own hormones and may lead to negative health effects.[23][24][25][26] Early development appears to be the period of greatest sensitivity to its effects.[27] Regulatory bodies have determined safety levels for humans, but those safety levels are currently being questioned or under review as a result of new scientific studies.[28][29]<br /><br />In 2009 the The Endocrine Society released a scientific statement expressing concern over current human exposure to BPA.[30]"<br /><br />The Wikipedia article is much longer and contains lots of information on BPA. It's all bad news. Amy's canned products all contain BPA. This is unfortunate because Amy's recipes are good tasting. Amy's is aware of the problem and have been "researching it" for years now. But they can't seem to get around to removing this dangerous poison from their products.<br /><br />It's not worth the risk to yourself, your children, and your unborn children. So please avoid this product and any other that contains BPA. When Amy's does the right thing and stops using BPA in their canned products, they'll be fit to eat. But not until then.<br /><br />Update: See comments section for an update to this review.

review/summary: NRG Vitality dog food from Amazon
review/text: I own a l year old Corgi.  When I got him from the breeder he had been started on NRG Vitality and I continued use of the dog food.  Now at l year of age he weighs 23 lbs. and has lots of energy.  He is slim and when he went in for his last vet visit, I asked if he was too slim.  The answer was that his weight and health was perfect.  My vet asked what we were feeding him and I replied NRG Vitality.  She had not heard of it so asked it I could bring in the wrapper.  I did and she was pleased to see that it was approved by by an agency as being quality - I have forgotten the 5 letter name of the agency.  It is expensive but I have heard from the breeder that what you spend in dog food price you save in Vet bills over the life of the dog.  More than pleased with the dog food - and he loves it!

review/summary: Excellent chopped garlic
review/text: I use a LOT of garlic when I cook, so, this was a very convenient item to keep stocked in my pantry.<br /><br />My only complaints are as follows:<br /><br />A. The jars REEK of garlic even though they weren't leaking (I inspected them all very well). In fact, even the box they were shipped in stank to high heaven like garlic. So, I had to ziplock bag the jars before I put them in the pantry which solved that conundrum.<br /><br />B. This chopped garlic has metabisulfite in it and if you have a sulfite sensitivity this is definitely not the product for you.<br /><br />C. I'm not a big fan of soy oil and this product uses soy oil as the 'oil' in this garlic.<br /><br />Regarding the consistency of this product...this is partially a paste with chunks of chopped garlic so it's more of a mix of paste and chopped garlic rather than just chopped garlic. You definitely need to give it a good stir before you refrigerate it after opening because the oil floats to the top of the jar.<br /><br />The flavor is excellent and worked great in my ginger/lemon/garlic/pepper/honey/mustard/tarragon salad dressing. It cooks up fine as long as you add it AFTER some other food is already in the pan (veggies or meat etc.) because this will pop and splatter (especially at high cooking temps). It worked great in my Italian meatballs and mixed with butter and paprika on my garlic bread.<br /><br />Bonus: The jars are super cute and I'll be keeping them and re-using them for other things.

The worst part is the garlic explodes like popcorn when you saute it in oil. It shoots oil and garlic about a foot in the air and, if you do not cover the pan, it will burn you. It even explodes in prepared foods that need to be fried, like meatballs. KEEP AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!!

review/text: I've been shopping the gourmet and international isle of my local grocery store lately. I guess it must be out of boredom for the regular things I have in my diet. In any case, I've found some real interesting things. Here's one: Zatarains Creole Mustard. Mmmmm. good! It's not overly hot and is about the same as my regular Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard, but it has a different mix of spices that give it a fresh new flavor. I can't see anything in the ingredients that would make it stand out so, but it does and I'm hard placed to describe the flavor. Perhaps the secret is in the vinegar. It's a brown mustard and is somewhat coarsely ground. Quite good!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: It's curry-tastic!!!
review/text: I have been a fan of S&amp;B Golden Curry since I found a box in SF's Japantown.  I wasn't able to read the preparation instructions since they were in Japanese, so I had a friend translate for me.  Then I found it in the U.S. and realized that the instructions he gave me were not at all a translation, but they are better than what's printed on the box.  So disregard the printed directions and use my recipe instead!  1 lb. chicken, 1 large onion, 3 medium potatoes (peeled), 2 carrots (peeled).  Cut all the preceding into medium-sized pieces.  Brown the onion and chicken.  Add 3-4 cups of water and the potatoes and carrots.  Cook for 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are done.  Remove from heat and add the Golden Curry (cut it into pieces for easier melting).  Mix well and it's soooooo tasty!  Serve over rice or udon noodles.  5 servings?  HA!  3 servings for people with normal appetites.

review/text: As the previous poster has said, this curry is beautiful.  I usually boil the potatoes and carrots for a bit to get them soft, and then add them to the chicken/onions so that the chicken doesn't get too tough from overcooking.  And if you like a slightly sweet (and smoother) tasting curry, and a chopped up banana to the mix!  I know it doesn't sound good, but it's magical.

review/text: I fried my first turkey at thanksgiving 2011. I read a lot about the process looking for the best recipes and tips. I cam across this seasoning kit and it turned out amazing! Everyone declared my turkey the best they'd ever had. I felt bad, because mom had always cooked thanksgiving before and I didn't want her feelings hurt, but later she also said it was the best turkey. This came with everything needed for 1 turkey. Do your research buy this, use it, and you'll have the best turkey every! =)

review/text: Besides the quick delivery of this product, I used it this past weekend in a beer can chicken recipe I devised from watching experienced chefs. First I injected the bird with the Creole seasoning and rubbed with the Cajun spice that accompanied as a kit. Added fresh garlic to the beer and with the help of the Masterbuilt Butterball Buttery Creole Seanoning Kit created the most exceptionally moist and flavorful chicken I had ever tasted!!!!!!

review/summary: NOT THAT GREAT
review/text: I purchased the Butterball Turkey Fryer for my husband as a Christmas gift.  He was really excited about trying everything.  The fryer never worked out of the box. I returned it a few days later. We ended up baking the turkey in the oven. He had injected it already with this seasoning kit, according to directions on the package.  Now I don't know if it would have tasted differently fried rather than baked, but it was horrible.<br />We ended up throwing the turkey out.  It was inedible. Fortunately I am the mother of an Eagle Scout and I am always prepared with a Plan B.  I purchased a glazed ham the same time I purchased the turkey.  Christmas dinner was saved.  So I don't know whether it was baking the bird that made the difference or what, but beware if you don't fry your turkey.

I noticed this, which appears to be the same as O'Dells and didn't read closely that it was 16 ounces not 128 ounces due to the price being relatively close. Was shocked when it got here to discover it was only 16 ounces. Price comparison...O'Dells 128 ounces $17.99 (.14 per ounce) Paragon 16 ounce $12.63 (.78 per ounce). Run away from this item quickly. If O'Dells is unavailable, get the Wabash Valley Farms instead!

review/text: I'm a huge popcorn lover.  My name is Dave and as long as I can remember I've always loved hot buttered popcorn.  I've been a machine operator in a manufacturing plant for over 20 years and I took a part time job on the side as a projectionist for a local theater. Free popcorn and soda, oh, and free movies too. I've always wondered where do you get that popcorn topping they use in theaters because I've tried melted butter. Nope. Nothing like theater butter. I love shopping online at www.Amazon.com and one day it hit me, maybe Amazon has it. I searched and sure enough there it was. Paragon 16-Ounce O'Dells Supur-Kist II Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping.  IT'S THE REAL THING! If you love hot buttered popcorn, please go on Amazon.com and order Paragon butter flavored popcorn topping. It's so good!

review/summary: MY KIND OF COOKIE!
review/text: I'm a long-time fan of Fig Newtons. So I saw these Fruit Thins and just had to try today's offering from our favorite cookie monster - maker, I mean.<br />  Newtons Fruit Thins do not disappoint! The dried cranberries are tasty, chewy and plentiful. Then there's the citrus tang over a bed of oatmeal. Hmmm mmm! Perfect to grab and munch on the go, as I do - or to dip in a hot beverage like tea and savor slowly - my wife's preference.<br />  Looking over the ingredients, there is no corn syrup, a plus (although there is sugar in the recipe), and no mouthful of unpronounceable chemicals.<br />  For those who aren't fig fans, you'll want to try these. The cranberries are a flavorful alternative.<br />  I'd say these are as close to health food as anything that tastes this good can get.

review/summary: Pretty good with hot coffee
review/text: This is definitely an adult cookie, not too sweet, with the consistency of a graham cracker and about the same thickness. An English person might refer to such a cookie a *tea biscuit*.<br /><br />Each cookie contains dried cranberries (not nearly enough of them for me) and you'll definitely need something to dunk them in if you going to eat more than a couple, either coffee or milk.<br /><br />If you like the taste of home-made scones then you'd probably like these. I don't know that it's a great compliment but these cookies, unlike chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin cookies, *are* resistible. You can set a limit on how many you plan to eat and then lay the package aside. So that might be a left-handed inspiration for me to continue buying them.<br /><br />Three cookies (the serving size) yield 140 calories. There are about 30 cookies to a package.<br /><br />I'd buy them again for myself but they're not a cookie that I would serve to guests if I were trying to impress them.

review/summary: A Fig Newton Cookie?
review/text: The Newton brand has extended its profile into these "Fruit Thins". The package is well designed and easy to open and looks nice. There are two rows of cookies (as I call them, I don't know what a "thin" is), each about 2-inches in diameter.. It looks like about 50 cookies in a package. Biting into it, it has a firmness, but not over-cooked where it crumbles, but not too soft where it melts. Its somewhere in the middle. The cranberries here are the winners. They are what keeps this cookie together! They have a vibrant taste to them and contrast the oats very well with a hint of citrus behind it. There are a few other flavors, but one I am sampling is the Cranberry Citrus Oats. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wonder if this something I would seek out myself to buy. I enjoyed them very much and will have no problem finishing off the package, but whether or not I will return to buy them again is debatable. I have not had a fig newton in such a long time that I dont foresee this replacing any memories of the fig, or even any inclination towards a cookie in the near future (maybe that is not something that should be considered as part of my review, but I am). But if you are a cookie person who likes that snack to have in the house, I would definitely recommend this as something new to try out. You will probably enjoy it as much as I did.

review/summary: An interesting change for this brand, but good
review/text: With the name Newton attached, you anticipate the soft outisde and fruit center.  Yes, this box is labeled crispy cookie. It is just the mental image from a product name.<br /><br />The package arrived with 2 rows of 14 cookies. It said serving size of 3 cookies, so I went for it. No milk, all cookie. You definitely taste the grain. It gives the cookie the heavier taste.<br /><br />I had the Cranberry Citrus type and I definitely found little chewy cranberries in the cookie. I am not sure about idetifying any citrus taste however.  The ingredients listed natural flavors, so I guess that is where the citrus is.<br /><br />With the wheat and grain content, the cards are there. I am going to see how long it takes the family to finish the box off before buying a replacement.<br /><br />Overall they were good.  Not exciting, not bad.  Just good.<br /><br />**Updated: After a few days I found myself going back to the box and enjoying them more.  I think the initial expectation of Newtons threw me off.  Plus the fact that two others loved them and then the kids devoured them at the first chance had me come back and update and raise the rating.

review/text: These Newtons Fruit thins are a tasty, firm and light cookie to eat.  By light, I mean the taste is understated and subtle.  They are a plain biscuit cookie with an earthy oat and lemony citrus hint to them.  Kid cookies, probably not.  Adult cookies with coffee or tea, absolutely.  Having eaten my share of Nabisco Fig Newtons, I am surprised by how different this cookie product is from their more traditional offerings.  These are original in concept, and delightful in taste.

All in all a tasty cookie as long as you are not expecting an Oreo.

review/summary: An Adult Treat
review/text: Healthy continues to be the marketing tool du jour. Newtons Fruit Thins from Nabisco is no different. Just putting the word "thin" in the name has a subtle effect on the buyer: These cookies are healthy and will help be thin. I don't mind marketing tactics, but the buyer needs to go into the purchase with eyes open.<br /><br />Newton's Fruit Thins are a thin wafer-like cookie with some fruit bits in it. Not real sweet and they definitely have the flavor of whole grains.<br /><br />If spite of the packaging labels that will attract the buyer -- "real fruit," "whole grain," "no corn syrup" -- the cookies still have five grams of fat and 140 calories per three cookie serving.<br /><br />The cookies are dry, but not crunchy. They are perfect for those who like to dunk cookies in their drink. For those seeking a sweet snack, the thins will seem bland, only one or two bites actually had a piece of fruit large enough to taste.<br /><br />I prefer the less sweet snack so will probably purchase this product for those nibble cravings. I do recommend that buyers read the label before deciding that this product is really as healthy as it may sound on the outside.

review/summary: Distant Memories Returned
review/text: At first, I couldn't put my finger on it. But then I focused on the scent coming from the package. There it was! That smell brought me back to my childhood, a gentle, slight hint of citrus that transported me back to my grandfather's house and our big family gatherings decades in the past. It was a world of home-baked goods that we lost when a generation moved on, a whirl of cookies and cakes and pies pleasantly devoured with every passing holiday.<br /><br />The Newton's Fruit Thins surprise you when you open the package not only for their scent, but their taste and the sheer number of them. In this world of "100 calorie packs" it would be easy for a company to skimp on a new product, but Nabisco did not go that route. They're advertised on the package as crispy, but that should not be read as potato chip crispy, instead as butter cookie crispy. And the fruit - in this case cranberries - add a burst of flavor that mixes perfectly with the crunch, the texture and the pleasant scent.<br /><br />It's been three days since I opened the package, and that smell is still there, even after the Fruit Thins are long gone. I almost don't want to throw the bag away.

review/text: Taste is very a subjective thing.  What one person loves, another may hate.  I did not love these crackers but you may.  They are not bad but I did not care for the taste or texture.  They are also fairly caloric for a small cracker.  I don't agree with the other reviewer who said they have no cranberry flavor.  They have subtle but distinct cranberry and citrus flavors.  The fruit is rather sticky and chewy.  I think that was the main thing I disliked about these crackers.  It is not your typical "Newton" texture.

review/summary: A Crunchy Cookie with Mixed Results
review/text: I'm not a fan of fig newtons, mainly because of the figs, so when I saw the new Newton Fruit Thins I thought I would give them a try.  I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  While I like cranberries, I don't like a lot of them and the cracker/cookie definitely had a little cranberry taste to them.  As with the Fig and Honey flavor, the cookie/cracker very much had a graham cracker taste to it, so I could easily have one or two of these as a snack.  However, I doubt I could eat more than that in one sitting.  While they were good, they were a bit on the dry side and even the dried fruit didn't help with that.  So I would have to say, if you're trying to diet and looking for a quick snack, the Newton Fruit Thins are a good choice.  For a larger snack, not so much.<br /><br />I did have my husband and son try them, with mixed results.  While my four year old loved them and wanted to have more, the hubby wasn't sold.  He thought that the dried fruit was barely noticeable (he likes cranberries a lot more than I do) and they could've definitely use more.  Also, the crunchy factor took away from the whole experience.<br /><br />Edited on 5/3/11: One thing I have noticed, if you leave the crackers/cookies out, unsealed, a lot of the crunchiness disappears; they are a little softer without taking any of the flavor away.  I'm actually liking them a lot more this way too.

review/summary: Name is misleading-Hard to identify what is really is by package
review/text: ok, when i saw this, i first thought "cranberry fig newtons", hooray. This is a cross between a fruit roll up snack and a flatbread biscuit.  The fruit was very tasty and chewy and the best part.  I had to dunk the cookie into milk to soften it up a bit and smooth the texture since it was very dry.  While it is good, i would choose something else as a snack if I had a choice.  This is not a "fruit thin", it's biscuit with fruit.  I wasn't even sure what to expect by the packaging.  Either make the cookie more like a cookie or make it a flavored biscuit in a different shape (like for high tea).  But I did eat them all and enjoyed every bite.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: "Newtons Fruit Thins" were a very pleasant surprise. I've never been a fan of the old standard Newtons - too soft, too figgy. These crispy cookies are quite delicious. They are a fairly thin crisp, lightly sweet cookie with bits of fruit baked right into them. There is no fruity filling like there is in the original Newtons. The flavor of the chewy bits of cranberry, combined with light citrus elements offer just the right flavor balance to the sweetness of the cookie, and the oats add a nice wholesome texture. The package says each serving contains 8g "whole grain", even though 3 cookies offers only 1 gram of fiber, and "whole grain wheat flour" is listed on the ingredients below "sugar". But, considering this is a cookie, how healthy can one expect it to be? I will definitely buy these again.

review/text: These "Fruit Thins" are the perfect treat. Crunchy, flavorful, sweet but not TOO sweet, and satisfying. I really love the cranberry citrus flavor, as it has just the slightest amount of tart to balance the crunchy and sweet. They are my new favorite snack!

review/summary: These are good!
review/text: I got the citrus cranberry oat..these really are good!  They taste to me like graham cracker w/dried cranberry pcs in it.  The citrus/oat was not distinctive.  They come in thin cookie shape, several to each tray..makes you feel like you can eat several and not be loaded up on calories.  Needless to say, tasty w/cold glass of milk or some nice hot tea or coffee.  Definitely going to try the other flavors..this is certainly not just a squished fig newton! No cholesterol and I think 3 cookies were 140 cal

review/text: I just received this item yesterday, April 27th, and I have been munching on them off and on since then.  They taste SO GOOD that it's hard to stop with just one!  *SMILE*  As I was munching, this food reminded me of Vanilla Wafers with cranberries in it.  (Vanilla Wafers are another weakness.)<br /><br />I do wish it were a lower calorie item without the ingredient of fructose.  Having it higher in fiber would be even better as long as they are able to keep the DELICIOUS taste!

review/text: These are thin and crispy/crunchy - which makes them somewhat distinct from other cookies.  I liked that texture very much.  There is a good blend between cookie and fruit, and the blend of fruit selected was different but good.<br /><br />In addition, for me they had just the right amount of sweetness without being overly so.  Sometimes I want a cookie that isn't incredibly sweet, but still satisfying.  These fit the bill.  A nice surprise.

review/summary: Not a cookie - more like a digestive biscuit
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect from the name "Newton Fruit Thins" and the picture on the box. Given that fruit newtons slogans have been "the cookie that thinks it's a fruit" and "a cookie is just a cookie, but a Fruit Newton is cookie and cake", I had thought it might a sweet, crisp thin cookie, similar to a ginger thin. However, this is more like a digestive biscuit (such as McVities) or tea biscuit. It's very crumbly and feels as though it contains healthful ingredients.<br /><br />While it claims oats and whole grains, oats are the 5th ingredient, and whole wheat is the 3rd. It also says "citrus", which is not listed under the ingredients, unless it's part of the "natural flavors". The cranberries are dried and chewy and tend to stick to the teeth. This cookie has no high fructose corn syrup, using sugar (ingredient #2) and fructose as sweeteners.<br /><br />3 cookies are listed as the "serving size" and have 5g of fat, 95mg sodium, 22g carbohydrates, 1g of fiber, and 2g protein. There are about 30 cookies in each package.<br /><br />If you're looking for a sweet fix, this would not be the "cookie" for you. It would, however, go nicely with an afternoon pot of tea and a chat. The good news is that you'd be unlikely to want to polish off the entire box at one sitting!

review/summary: Crispy Chewy Fruity Oaty - And That's A GOOD Thing!
review/text: I wasn't quite sure what to expect with the "Newtons" name on the box, but these definitely aren't "fig newton" style cake cookies with gooey filling. Rather, these fruit thins are a thin but hearty oat cookie with a semi-crisp quality, embedded with chewy, flavorful bits of cranberry and citrus.<br /><br />I found them to be very tasty, and a great match with my (all-important) morning coffee. Because the cookies are thin, they'd also make for a nice presentation when having guests. Although personally, I think I'll just hog my box (grin).

review/text: I recently picked up the blueberry flavored cookies to try and liked them.  But this Cranberry Citrus Oat flavor is even better.  It's a thin cookie made with real fruit and whole grains.  The cookies are crispy and sized right. They are in a tray which keeps them from breaking and they stay fresh in the package. I'll buy these again and want to try other flavors.

review/summary: Newtons still comfort food, but can't beat the originals!
review/text: Upon opening the package, the smell of the cookies instantly reminded me of animal cookies in the little circus box.  The taste, although fruitier, was similar as well making for a nice combination of sweet without being too sweet.  I had mixed feelings about the fruit, it was fun to get a different texture with different bites, but the fruit also seemed to stick to my teeth which was a bit annoying. The cookies are a simple snack, not something I'd put on a platter for company, but they would be nice for backpacks, stroller bags, or office desk drawers.  They have the feel of a healthy treat, although reading the nutritional information they only contain 4% of daily fiber (as opposed to Wheat Thins' 8%), 4% of iron, and nothing much else, so that was a bit disappointing.  In any case, I'd buy them again, the crunch and taste were pleasant and the eating was fairly guilt free.

review/summary: A Nice Cookie
review/text: First of all, do not let the "Newton" name lead you to expect something that this cookie is not. This is not a Fruit Newton type of cookie. No.<br /><br />It is a thin and crispy cookie, with a nice flavor and some nice chewy bits of fruit sprinkle throughout. Is it in anyway 'healthier' than other cookies? Well, I am but sure. 3 cookies/140 calories is pretty average for store bought cookies I think. No corn syrup, 8g per serving of whole grain..both pluses, if small pluses, I think.<br /><br />Overall, a nice little treat if you like a tasty, thin, crispy bit of a sweet.

review/summary: Possibly the best tasting cookie ever
review/text: I couldn't believe how good these cookies tasted when I first tried them.  I was actually shocked, shocked I tell you, at how incredibly perfect a cranberry based cookie could taste.  I'm a big chocolate addict from way back, so I'm usually not that enamoured of anything that doesn't include chocolate.  However, I actually liked the taste of these BETTER THAN any chocolate cookie I've ever had (with the possible exception of the old Fudgetown cookies, but those haven't been available for years).  Even if you think you don't like cranberries, you should try these.  They're really amazingly flavorful.  So, you're asking me, why did I only give them four stars if they're so great?  Because I didn't particulary like the crunchiness of them.  I like my Newtons to be chewy, like the regular old Newtons of yore.  I know, that's just a personal preference.  You may actually like the crunchy style cookies better.  But the taste is unbeatable.  If they could just take the exact taste from this product and put it in a regular chewy Newton, I think that might be the perfect cookie.

review/text: Everyone I let try this cookie liked them.  I gave them to kids, adults, men, women and without a doubt everyone said they were good.  They taste like cranberries and cookie.  They dont have a lot of calories per three and come in at 150 calories with a minimal amount of fat.  I am not advocating eating the whole thing at once but you can rest assured eating one or two wont load you up on fat.  I would have to say that these are one of my favorite things I have tried in a long time.  My son who wont eat anything ate these as well and I think that should say it all.  I was worried at first about what they might taste like but one bite in any fear I had was gone.  Great item, I will definitely buy it again.

review/summary: One out of two in my family like these
review/text: I liked these, and would have given them a 4/5, but my wife felt they taste like cardboard.<br /><br />They are cranberry and orange flavor. The cranberry is chopped up and is candied/chewy, and is integral to the cookie. The orange is like an orange extract. The cookie itself tastes like a oat cookie (e.g., a Walker oat cookie), but flatter, with bit of chewy cranberry.<br /><br />There are not a lot of cookies in a package. There are 2 trays/rows of cookies. The packaging says serves 10, but I found that I'd tend to eat 1/3 or 1/2 a row, which would be around 5 servings per package. A lot of cookie packaging is being downsized during our recession, but there's less to eat in here than a typical pack of fig newtons.<br /><br />And again, my wife said no.

review/summary: Delicious but calories add up quickly
review/text: These cookies are quite good.  One of my favorite combinations is cranberry and orange, so these hit the spot.  The cookie is very think and crispy.  Shipping was a bit of an issue as several cookies were broken in half (and a couple into smaller pieces).<br /><br />It's pretty easy to consume a serving because the cookies are not that large and quite thin.  Serving size is 3 cookies and has 140 calories and 5 grams of fat (1 saturated).  But it is a cookie, so we're not trying to diet on these, right!  I think the description of this item...Newtons Fruit Thins, with the emphasis on 'thins' on the box could be a bit misleading, there is nothing thin about the caloric and fat content of these cookies! I could easily eat 10-12 of these in a sitting if I wanted to.  I do think companies could do a better job with low fat ingredients.  I started buying the low fat fig newtons and they taste just fine compared to the regular kind but have a fraction of the fat.<br /><br />Calories aside, these cookies taste great!

review/text: I found these fruit thins to be pretty good.  They taste a bit like shortbread to me.  There is not a lot of fruit in them -- significantly less than in a regular fig newton, for example.  So, any cranberry fans may well find them to be disappointing.  All-in-all, assuming that I can find them at a good price, I may well buy some.

review/summary: Excellent crispy cookie ...
review/text: I was excited to have the opportunity to try these cookies. I've been a big fan of Fig Newtons (and the other fruity varieties), and the description of these sounded like something completely different.<br /><br />They are definitely different from the other Newton fruit cakes.  These are crispy, more like a cross between a graham cracker and those wonderful Moravian thin spice cookies we get sometimes at Christmas.  They are laced with chopped cranberries and a hint of orange flavor, and a nice size -- about 3" in diameter with a scalloped edge.  The orange flavor isn't overpowering, but it's not too subtle, either; and the tartness of the cranberries came through as well.<br /><br />These would be perfect with a cup of tea as an afternoon snack, and the nutrition stats show that these are not going to totally destroy a diet.<br /><br />I'll definitely purchase again, and look forward to trying some of the other flavors.

Cookies are thin but big...about 3" across.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Expensive! Amazon's price is $27.30 for a 4-pack. That's almost $7 per 10.5 oz package.<br />2. Crumbly. About half the package I received through the Vine program were broken.<br />3. Even though the ingredients appear to be pretty healthy, they are also high in calories and fat. According to the information on the package, a serving of 3 cookies has 140 calories and 5 grams of fat (1 g sat fat).<br /><br />Overall, good but too expensive for me to buy on a regular basis.

review/summary: great cookie but not a filled cookie like everything else called Newton
review/text: Because These are called Newton Fruit Thins I was expecting a thin  filled cookie, however, these are not filled. They are thin crispy shortbread like cookies  with a nice texture and a dash of citrus flavor. There are a few bits of dried cranberry scattered throughout, the  fruit adds some texture but does not dominate the flavor. I probably would not have known the bits were cranberry if it had not said so on the package. The cookies are not very sweet and are a good tea or coffee biscuit. These are very good served with cheese as well as being a traditional cookie. The oats and lower sweetness made them appeal to my healthy eating daughter  though they are not actually health food.<br />We all liked these a lot and will probably get them again. They were eaten very quickly. family members who were not aware that these  were called Newtons (fruit thins) loved them unconditionally. The  family members who knew that the word Newtons was part of the name were initially disappointed because they are not filled cookies.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: I chose these cookies because I was lead to believe that they were some sort of really thin Newton (as the package implies) with the expected chewy/moist texture.  Instead these are crispy cookies with a cracker like texture.  While I was initially a bit surprised, I think that the Newton Fruit Thins are a great product.  The cracker itself is subtle in its taste (only moderately sweet), crispy in texture,  and contains bits of citrus flavored cranberries.  I enjoyed them.  They are good in isolation as a snack, but I would also recommend them with jam or cream cheese.  My 19 month old daughter loves them.<br /><br />The serving size is a little on the small side (3 crackers), but they don't appear horribly unhealthy.

review/text: Newtons Fruit Thins are a diabolically good cookie, and cranberry citrus oat version is no exception. They have a light crisp texture and would make an excellent sandwich cookie to serve with ice cream or fruit. I have tried the blueberry version but I think I like this version better.  Each wafer comes with slivers of cranberry and a healthy wholesome light citrusy taste.  These cookies are made by Nabisco, an American company and are actually baked in Canada- which is a bit disappointing. The packaging contains some plastic, but not as much as some.  3 cookies are 140 calories which makes each waver about 46 calories.<br /><br />If I had my druthers, I would prefer less vitamin fortification since I am sensitive to eating enriched foods, but for a less vitamin-sensitive person I'm sure they are fine. Overall, I liked the cookie, and think this is a fine addition to The Nabisco/Kraft Foods line.

review/summary: If you really like graham crackers...?
review/text: Newtons Fruit Thins (Cranberry and Citrus) / B004FEJ968<br /><br />I was really excited about receiving these cookies through Amazon Vine - I'm a big fan of the Newtons "fig newtons" line of products and always have been. It seemed like a transition to "cookie" would be inevitably good, but... these cookies just didn't do it for me or my family.<br /><br />I guess I should have been concerned when my husband bit into one of these and said, "These taste like sand!" I didn't feel like they were quite *that* bad, but it's true that these are *very* dry and somewhat crumbly. They remind me a little bit of dry graham crackers or dry "nilla wafers" - I ended up dunking these cookies in milk to make them a little more palatable.<br /><br />The dried fruit bits in these cookies are nice, but not anything to really write home about. The cranberry and orange flavoring is very subtle and seems to come across more in the scent than in the actual taste.<br /><br />Overall, I like the sweetness balance of these cookies - they're not overpowering, and the flavor is nice - but the intense dryness of the cookie combined with the sticky chewiness of the dried fruit was just too toothsome for me. If the cookie had been softer, I would have liked these a lot more - as it was, I felt like I was eating very dry crackers and I didn't enjoy the experience.<br /><br />I don't like to waste things, so I'll try to finish the entire bag, but the rest of the family has already informed me that I'm on my own.<br /><br />NOTE: This review is based on a free review copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/text: When I saw these Fruit Thins they piqued my interest.  I have not had Fig Newtons in a long time and I love dried cranberries.  They were a nice surprise.  It seems like a combination of cracker and cookie, kind of like Animal "Crackers" which all adults love but try not to admit while we snack some of the kids!  The fruit thin was crisp but not hard and the slightly sweet taste of the chewy cranberries was very nice. Between me and my mom we ate most of the package before we knew it. I will definately get more and try the other flavors.

review/summary: Buy these cookies! Delicious, crunchy treat.
review/text: Never having been a fan of Fig Newtons, I approached this new product with some trepidation.  Wow!  I was very pleasantly surprised at how delicious these new cookies are.  Three of the large crispy cookies are only 140 calories (two cookies are less than the magic 100 calories) but they are packed with fruit and flavor!  The cranberry citrus oat flavor are delectable nuggets of cranberries and orange in a buttery tasting cookie that is low in fat.  I also purchased the chocolate raspberry flavor and it is just as good having a rich dark chocolate flavor and large tasty pieces of raspberry.<br /><br />Newton seems to have come out with several new products recently after sticking with their "tried and trues" for many years.  I predict that these new fruit thins (there are four different flavors) will definitely be keepers.  They are delicious and worth going back for more again and again.<br /><br />Buy these cookies!

review/text: I got theses yesterday, tried a couple, and put them out on the counter. Everyone in the house has been grabbing one as they walk by. There are only three left.<br /><br />These cookies are light,crispy and flavorful. They're just sweet enough to satisfy without loading you up with sugar.<br /><br />These are a winner. I'm going to snag one of the last ones now while I have a chance.

review/summary: If you like the slight taste of fruit....
review/text: and I do!!  This new product from Nabisco is definitely worth your money.  If what you want is a light cracker/cookie with a hint of cranberry taste this is the one for you.  Although the label says "oats" I cannot detect the taste or consistency of oats in this product.  It crunches in your mouth like a graham cracker but has that slight taste of cranberries in it.  This would be nice with a cup of tea or coffee by your side.  Definitely would buy this again.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: I tend to favor fruit desserts and cookies and cakes over chocolate, so be aware of that as you read this review. I like Fig Newtons and all the different fruit Newtons, but I wasn't sure what to expect in these cookies. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Unlike Newtons, these cookies are very light and crispy. They're a bit delicate, and they broke easily, which is probably why they're packaged in plastic trays in the bag as opposed to simply being free roaming in the bag. I think if I were to put them in a ziplok bag, they'd all break into pieces. Not the sturdiest of cookies, but very delicately crispy.<br /><br />The flavor is good. There are bits of cranberries that aren't too big nor too small. The package says "citrus" and there are pictures of oranges on the front, but I thought these tasted more lemony than orangey. I think I would have liked more cranberry flavor and less lemon flavor. The cookie was also not too sweet, which I tend to like better. This was definitely less sweet than a chocolate chip cookie.<br /><br />The texture is nutty and you can definitely taste the whole grains and fiber, which I like, but which other people may not care for. It's also a drier cookie, not as oily as normal chocolate chip cookies bought at the store or on the grocery shelves. I tend to favor this, but other people used to more butter or lard might find the cookie a bit dry.<br /><br />I enjoyed eating these with sweetened tea. I really think this is my new favorite store-bought cookie.

review/summary: good texture and flavor
review/text: A pleasingly chewy, thin cookie with distinct cranberry flavor. It tastes fresh and oatey, with flavor notes that are more bakery than supermarket cookie aisle.<br /><br />There's a good balance of quantity vs calories: three cookies are just 140 calories, and there are about 30 cookies per package.<br /><br />I'm usually not a fan of big-brand packaged cookies.  They are invariably full of artificial ingredients and excessive calorie-counts, while tasting anything but fresh, and trying to mask that lack of freshness with excessive sweetness.  These Newtons Fruit Thins surprise me with their balance of fruit and grain without delving into dull health-food territory.  Recommended.

review/summary: A snack the whole family can enjoy!
review/text: Seriously.  When you have someone who has a whole mouthful of sweet teeth instead of just one (me), someone who doesn't really enjoy sweet stuff (my brother) and someone in between the two (my father), and we all thought these Newton Fruit Thins were delicious, I think it's safe to say that these crispy cookies will appeal to everyone.  With a lovely citrus flavor, chewy cranberry pieces and hearty rolled oats, these are cookies you can feel good about letting your kids snack on.  Not only are they made with real fruit and whole grain, they don't have high fructose corn syrup, the biggest selling point for me.  No matter what propaganda the Corn Board puts out, HFCS is not an ingredient I want to put into my body and is, in fact, something I cut out of my diet several years ago (and by doing so, I lost about ten pounds without doing anything else to my diet or lifestyle).<br /><br />With a serving size of three cookies--and each cookie is 2 1/2" in diameter, so these aren't small treats--at 140 calories per serving, you can indulge your cravings without totally derailing your diet.  The cookies are quite filling as well.  I'm not saying these are a health food item; after all, they are cookies.  However, at 7 grams of sugar per serving, they're a better alternative to many of the sweet treats being offered today.  And these will satisfy your sweet tooth just as effectively.<br /><br />The only quibble I have is that the cranberry flavor isn't as strong as I thought it would be.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, as the overall flavor is light and refreshing.  It's just more on the citrus side than the cranberry side.  However, that's perfectly okay with me and it's certainly not going to stop me from purchasing this flavor again.  These are yummy!

review/summary: Good oat & fruit taste, all-natural cookie snack
review/text: While these cookies taste nothing like the original Newtons, they're really good in their own way. They are fairly thin with a oatty, slightly buttery taste with the addition of dried cranberry bits and natural citrus flavor. The all-natural ingredients gives them their all-natural taste. (Real fruit, whole grain, no high fructose corn syrup, 3 cookies are 140 calories and only 7 grams of sugar) They're crunchy but not hard and taste great with beverages like tea or milk. If you are looking for a lighter, healthier cookie with a touch of natural fruit flavor, these make a delicious snack.

review/summary: Delicious Addition to the Newtons Family
review/text: A little bit of fat and carbs, zero cholesterol, and a fabulous crunch!  These snack cookies are definitely worth the roughly 45 calories per cookie, though you probably won't stop at the suggested serving size of 3.  I didn't.  If you're dieting, don't pass it by, just plan ahead.<br /><br />The cookie has a light flavor reminiscent of the cake-type cookies of the regular fruit Newtons line, just pressed thinner and dotted with lovely, tiny chunks of cranberry and citrus, just enough to add a bit of flavor and zing without overpowering the taste buds.  Though it's labeled a cookie, I can easily see this little gem smeared with cream cheese (or better yet, sandwiched with the stuff and a touch of whole-fruit jelly) for a special treat.  A gob of ice cream between two of them would be amazing!  The fact that it's not a sugary item makes it a great pairing with a nice cup of tea or coffee or a glass of wine as much as doled out with milk for the younger humans in your family.<br /><br />I rate this one a keeper!  Its nutritional count is bolstered with rolled oats and whole-grain whole wheat flour.  If it had a smidge of flax or some other additional holy grain, it would pass the tipping point and actually be a legitimate dietary necessity!

review/summary: More Cracker Than Cookie
review/text: I expected these to be a soft cookie, similar to the traditional Newtons. Instead, these are more of a crunchy cracker. They taste like a cross between a graham cracker and an animal cracker, with a cranberry zing.

review/text: The Newton Fruit Thins are part cracker, part cookie.  They are not too sweet, have a natural taste, and a good texture.  They are perfect for a wide variety of toppings and spreads to perk things up if you want.  They are not just a new product for the sake of a new product.  If you are looking for a a new snack or even a breakfast cracker, give these a try.  The best cracker I've tasted in quite a while.

review/summary: Sensible Snack
review/text: The worst thing I can say about these cookies is the "Newton" name.  You'd think they were variant of the wonderful Fig Newtons with lots of fruit filling.  Nope.  There's a TINY amount of fruit filling in these thin, tasty cookies.  So if you're looking for the gooey goodness of Fig Newtons... keep looking.<br /><br />However, these Fruit Thins can stand by themselves.  Crispy.  Not too sweet.  Nice texture - easy to nibble on.  Interesting taste.<br /><br />On the nutrition side, there's not a lot to be worried about.  A mere 5g fat and 7g sugar per 3 cookie serving.  And the cookies are a decent size.  It's not hard to limit yourself to one at a time after a meal - so now you're looking at a nominal 1.7g fat and 2.3g sugar.  What's the problem!?<br /><br />Summary: Tasty AND not as unhealthy as the typical cookie.  I like 'em!

review/summary: Wonderful snack.  Way to go Nabisco!  A+
review/text: I'll start off by saying that there is no hydrogenated oil in this product.  The second major plus is that the list of ingredients is small and I can pronounce everything on the list!  The final huge plus is that these wafers taste incredible.  The fruit bits are chewy and the wafer crisp.  Perfect with tea.  These snack wafers are officially on our buy list.  Great job, Nabisco!

review/summary: Mediocre with very little fruit.
review/text: While there may be some fruit in these cookies, there isn't enough to even notice when you are eating them. The taste is bland and mediocre. These cookies were supposed to be Cranberry Citrus Oat. I can't taste any Cranberry or Citrus or Oats, not sure what I am tasting. Given that these are called Newtons, I also expected them to be soft cookies (like fig newtons) but they are hard not soft. They also don't have much of anything beneficial in them either, no vitamins, essentially no fiber and very little protein but they do have some fat in them and lots of calories. They also contain fructose but not specified as to what type.<br /><br />To me, these are nowhere near as tasty as graham crackers. Honey Maid Low Fat graham crackers are healthier, lower in fat, higher in fiber, with some calcium and with no fructose.<br /><br />However, I would agree that these Newtons Fruit Thins are somewhat healthier than most other regular cookies.

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: I like these because they're not too sweet. But of course that also means you can just keep eating and eating them without realizing how many you've plowed your way through, so be careful...  a three-cookie serving contains 140 calories and 5 grams of fat<br /><br />Lots of fruit, and the citrus flavor REALLY comes through. And as they're thin and crisp, they're the perfect accompaniment to a cup of tea because they don't immediately go soggy. I'm not usually a big cookie person, but I'll probably be getting these again.

review/summary: Much better than original Newtons!
review/text: I'm not a big fan of the original Fig Newtons; I don't like the chewy texture. That's why these Newton Fig thins appeal to me- I love the crispy texture! I love cranberry orange muffins, and I get that same taste profile with these flat cookies. The serving size is three cookies, which has 140 calories, and it's a good sized serving.<br />I would have thought that there would be more fiber in these cookies, but there is only 1 gram per serving. That is kind of disappointing, but nowhere on the bag does it claim to be a 'healthy snack'.<br />I like that the packaging allows you to keep the bag sealed so the cookies don't get stale.<br />These are tasty cookies, and if you are just looking for a little afternoon treat at work or to got with a cup of tea, these cookies will more than satisfy that.

review/summary: Remember the Sunshine Lemon Coolers?
review/text: If you liked those, you'll like these!  I happen to have been a BIG fan ... HUGE ...  So, the only thing that perturbed me about the old lemon coolers (which share exactly nada with these in the appearances department) was the the powdered sugar was messy.  These Newtons have none of that, and still remarkably similar taste.  I can't imagine they have any more calories than the oldies, and DO have a little fiber (1g) and protein (2g).  I wouldn't call 'em health food, but then again, it's hard to find true, dyed-in-the-wool health food with this kind of taste.  I love 'em, and will buy them.  They're large, thin cookies, about the consistency of animal crackers with dried fruit bits in there to yield chewy, crunchy and citrus twang all at once.  I'm really happy with them (and I'm usually a Keebler guy, thru & thru).  My take on it: try 'em.

review/summary: Tasty and not too bad for you
review/text: I enjoyed these little thins "cookies". I've never reviewed food before, so please bare with me.<br /><br />The cookie part is very tasty, kind of like a graham cracker or teddy graham...I can't quite put my finger on it. The bits of cranberry in the cookie are real pieces, real enough to get stuck in my teeth (as dried cranberries do). There is a citrus taste, but no mention of "citrus" anything can be found on the ingredients list...unless you count "natural flavors". Three of these thin cookies is 140 calories, which I didn't think was too bad.<br /><br />We enjoyed them a lot. They're quite addicting. Good light snack cookie.

review/summary: Light, delicious cookies without a lot of sugar
review/text: These are delicious and slightly crisp, with dried cranberries, tangy natural fruit flavors, no ingredients with long, chemical names and only 7 grams of sugar for every three cookies you eat.  It's a happy marriage of very tasty and fairly healthy, combining unbleached enriched wheat flour with whole grain wheat and rolled oats. There is fructose but no high fructose corn syrup.  Fruit Thins are good choice when you want to satisfy your sweet tooth without abandoning natural food principles.

review/summary: Delicious Alternative to the Graham Cracker
review/text: The cookies (crackers) are about as round as a baseball.  They are crispy and crumbly like a graham cracker.  I shared both boxes I received with my co-workers and the comment I heard most often was that they tasted like a graham cracker. I also heard quite often, "Mmmmm, I would buy these."  We tasted both these and the honey-fig flavor and this was the favorite.<br /><br />I thought they tasted very nice. The cranberries added just the right amount of tart to the cookie.<br /><br />If healthy was a taste then that is what I would describe them as. They aren't unhealthy from what I can tell but they aren't exactly low fat or low calorie.  5gs of fat. 140 calories.<br /><br />They really did make for a nice little snack.

review/summary: Better than I thought they'd be!
review/text: Okay, first, you need to know that I usually don't buy cookies, we try to really limit our sweets intake and we also try to eat things that are 100% whole grain, so cookies just don't fit into that, we also shop almost exclusively in the natural/organic section.  I love regular Fig Newtons, but stopped eating them when we started eating whole grain and no/low sugar.  Also please know, I do not like crunchy cookies, I like soft cookies.  That said, I was surprised by how much I liked these.  They are thin and relatively crispy without being dusty/messy crispy.  I definitely taste the orange and oat more than the cranberry, but over all the flavor is nice and there is enough flavor, some plain cookies of this type are just like sugary cardboard, but these have flavor.  Now, what surprised me the most, how not-that-bad-for-you these are.  There are no preservatives which is nice.  The first ingredient is enriched flour, but they do have some whole wheat flour and whole oats in them too, the are sweetened with sugar, not HFCS, and has fructose listed near the end.  We won't buy treats or sweetened cereal where a serving has more than 9 grams of sugar, and guess what?  These only have 7 grams of sugar per serving which is three cookies.  I will not at all feel bad letting my kids eat these cookies, especially since a serving for a preschooler would be one cookie.  I only wish there was more fiber (more whole grain) in these.  I also like that they bag is re-sealable.

review/summary: Newton's Fruit Thins
review/text: Excellant. I do not like cranberries or fig newtons so I wasn't expecting much from these but I got a very nice surprise. They taste fantastic. I got the cranberry citrus oat. Very crunchy with great sweet taste and the fruit is definitly in every bite. They are about 2 1/2 to 3 inches across and about the thickness of 2 wheat thins. There were 30 in the 10.5 ounce package. I already ate 10 of them, hard to put them down once you start eating them. What a great way to get your daily fiber as well. They have 4% of your daily allowance in just 3 cookies. The best used by date was August 23 & I got them April 25 so plenty of time to eat them while they are fresh. Who am I kidding..... They won't last until tomorrow.... Order these or get them in your store, either way you won't be disappointed & I'm sure the kids will love them too, even babies just old enough to have crackers will love these. Gotta go, have some new cookies waiting for me to eat them....

review/summary: Decent Healthy Cookie But Needs More Cranberry
review/text: Let me say upfront that I am hardcore cranberry lover.  What are my credentials?  I drink 12-16oz glasses of 100% cranberry juice undiluted, often snack on unsweetened dried cranberries, and smother my Thanksgiving turkey in cranberry sauce.  So one could say I was looking forward to these cookies.<br /><br />Each cookie has about 6-8 fragments of cranberries which probably equals around 3-4 whole cranberries.  A light amount indeed unless these are some hidden fragments in the cookie that escaped my eyes.  Yes, it is a thin cookie but it is also a wide cookie measuring around 2.5 inches in diameter.  I'm not sure if it is the dry baking process or because the cranberries are often fragmented, but compared to say wonderful cranberry muffins, you don't get the strong cranberry punch unfortunately.  You can definitely taste the cranberries, but only in light form.  These cookies also provide multiple layers of flavoring with the orange "natural flavor".  I'm not big on mixing orange with my cranberry but I know some people like this combo and this might be the cookie for them.<br /><br />The bag is easy to open and has plastic covered metal band to help hold the package closed.  Given how dry these cookies are, though, I'm not sure it will matter much.  Cookies are made with non-bleached wheat which is a plus in my book.  Also contains no high fructose corn syrup.  A single bag contains two rows of cookies with 15 cookies per row (30 cookies total).
