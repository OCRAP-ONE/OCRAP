review/summary: Great Coffee!
review/text: I have a sensitive stomach and can't take those fire-blasted, carbonized roastings that a lot of coffee has been subjected to, so when I saw a medium roast, I wondered if it would be a true, flavorful medium roast or charred beans with a toasted outside.  I also am trying to cut back on caffeine.  So it seems that this coffee is tailor made for me!<br /><br />I have a cup of this every morning and I love it!  Great flavor, not much acid, clean aftertaste and enough of a jolt to get going without so much caffeine I get the jitters.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering this in the 50-pack boxes!

review/summary: A Great Product
review/text: This is a great tasting coffee.  By the taste alone, it would be difficult, if not impossible to tell that it has only half of the caffeine of their other great tasting coffee.  While in the brewing process, the aroma fills the air leading a person to anticipate the reward at the end of the brewing cycle.  If a person does not want the caffeine, this is the coffee for them.

review/text: I am not allowed to have too much caffeine as it sets my heart arrythmias off . However, no matter what decaf I tried I hated the taste. I have been using this for a month now, and not only is it fantastic tasting, there are no jitters or no caffeine effects like with pure coffee. This tastes so delicious and I can have several cups in the morning. Also Amazons price cannot be beat.

review/text: I received a smashed box that was barely taped shut. Upon opening, instead of receiving the usual, expected k- cups in wrapped boxes of 2 or 3 containing the individual k-cups, there were 50 individual servings thrown in the box. I counted them, so I did receive the amount ordered. But these cups look like they were discarded samples, all of them wrinkled, twisted, some with top punctured. Would you drink any of these? Highly disappointed, will not do further business with this vendor again. Time to order direct from Keurig.

review/text: Eh, just nothing exciting about these for the price. It is a mildly carbonated juice. Our kids really like some of the Switch and Izze flavors so thought we'd try these. These do NOT taste bad, but I think I can buy cheaper 60% juice products. Everyone may have just been disappointed, assuming these would have lots of carbonation like the Switch or Izze products. (By the way - not promoting all the Izze or Switch juices - I've rated some of them poorly for horrible taste.) Not sure how to rate these with stars - taste is pretty good for what it is, but I'm not buying them again since the kids don't like them.

review/summary: Not the best Sparkling beverage
review/text: There are some plus sides to this drink, its all natural and no added sugar.  I love my drinks to have a kick to them, and what I mean by that is I need my drink to have lots of fizz, in that department this drink is seriously lacking.  Its more of a weak tasting juice then a sparkling fruit juice in my opinion.  It is not worth the price, I rather stick to izze sparkling juices, they have so much more kick to them, strong flavor, and lots of fizz.  Each one contains two servings of fruit, which is awesome.  So this is ok, but I wouldnt waste my money on it again.  To be honest with you, it tastes like a sweet version of V8 juice :D lol

review/summary: Love these but not the $$$
review/text: Chewy Lemonhead and Friends is a great candy. My wife who is not a big candy eater, even loves them. Keep them in the fridge and they are even better. My kick is boxes are clearly marked "25 cents." There are 24 individual boxes in the item shown. do the math, .25 X 24 = 6.00. Ok that is the cost of the box. No discount, nothing! Then you add $6 for shipping and you are paying .50 / box. That is double the price. I just go the my local, high priced, convenience store and buy them for .25 a box plus 3 cents tax. 50 cents a box or 28 cents a box, you decide. I go in and get the entire box of 24 and my cost is 6.60 including tax. Better than $12.00 and waiting for it to arrive. Great candy but you are better off paying full retail and tax than the outrageous shipping.

review/text: Have you ever served up a can of Pedigree wet dog food for your furry little friend and felt secretly jealous as you watch him tear into the vaccuum packed ration like a lion tackling a zebra? If only it were possible for humans to survive on such simple yet delicious means.  If only there existed small, convenient meals of comparable taste and price made just for us folks at the top of the food chain.  Well, if you're still pondering a suitable solution then look no further than Hormel Compleats.  The beef steak tips with mashed potatoes in particular are sure to delight even the most sophisticated palette. In this meal we find overwhelmingly grainy mashed potatoes paired up with bland steak cutlets swimming in an even blander sauce that I can only assume to be some kind of gravy. With this kind of savory goodness you honestly can't go wrong at this price range. To top it all off, the meat appears to be 100% free of any type of seasoning or flavor enhancement in general, so don't hesitate to pile on some of your own sauces and spices to improvise. Not since the US Army's MREs (Meals Rejected by Ethiopians) have we seen such sublime culinary innovation.  In other words, it's the best of the best! Pick some up tonight for the whole family and keep the Pepto ready my friends, because believe me when I say this is one meal that just won't stay down on its own!

review/summary: Comparable smell and taste to dog food, and I eat lots of unhealthy foods
review/text: It's obvious this isn't a healthy meal, but rather the cheapest thing Hormel can put together for a "budget" meal. I knew this and did not care because I was tight on cash and was willing to risk the new experience with these microwave hormal meals.....<br /><br />While thrift shopping when I was broke a few months back, I picked up the usual 1-3 budget buck items like chef boyardee raviolis and such. I saw these hormal meals at the local grocery store and the price was definitely cheap and fit my budget. Most of them looked really good too. I chose this flavor as it seemed the most protein packed and the most delicious flavor (beef and potatoes, how can they mess that up? Its always good..........right?)<br /><br />Plus for the price, I could just tack it off as a bad "meh" meal if I did not like it. Under 3 bucks a piece for a small lunch type of meal is a good price.<br /><br />**CONCLUSION** - After tring this meat & potatoes meal, it looks good but it smells and tastes similar to opening up a can of wet dog food from Pedigree. I am being honest and I eat junky microwave meals A LOT so you know I am not a picky health nut writing bad reviews online. The other flavors seem to get higher ratings which is not surprising to me....  but this flavor, while appearing so good, is just horrible and almost unedible. If someone gave me this to take home, I would honestly put it in the pile of crappy canned foods I give to the homeless shelter (like lima beans, or kindey beans... yeah its that bad)

review/text: I like to keep Hormel's microwavable bowls on hand, since they can be stored at room temperature and are easily heated, for a very fast entree.  This particular dinner was not as good as others I've tried.  Hormel's Roast Beef and mash potatoes, and their chicken and dressing dinners are both tastier, I think.  Given the relative lack of variety available in this general product category, I rate Beef Steak Tips with Mash Potatoes well.

review/summary: Get's First Place among Hormel Compleats
review/text: I used to buy from Schwan's, but I no longer like what I used to get. Trying these very inexpensive meals was just for future selection purposes. But I decided to stick with these for a while. Had Swedish Meatballs - nope. Salsbury Steak - not so very. But this, actually good.<br /><br />I microwave it for 2 minutes, after lifting up the plastic from both sides to a point in the middle. For the taste to really develop, it must be blistering hot. Then I add some sage <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WR4LLU">Simply Organic Organic Ground Sage ( 1x1.80 OZ)</a> and Habanero powder <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHXIGO">Habanero Powder, Pure - 16 Oz Jar Each</a> on top. After trying several other compleats, this is the one I really prefer. The mashed potatoes are fluffy, the taste is like from a large family cook pot, and the portion just enough for a good meal. With it, I have a glass of chilled water with drops of Lime Juice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025VRCDA">Realime 100% Lime Juice, 15-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a> and sweetener <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQQEO">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener Granular, Individual Packets, 200 Count Package (Pack of 3)</a>.<br />Amazon has all the ingredients of making me a happy camper!

review/summary: Not one of the better ones
review/text: The beef steak tips with mash potatoes is on the lower end of the Hormel line. The gravy, for once, is surprisingly not too salty but I've always suspected that if you take the salt away, all that would be left is blandness and that is exactly what happened here. I also really wish Hormel would stay away from the mashed potatoes. Sliced potatoes is fine because they tend to have texture if not taste but mashed potatoes really don't add anything to their dishes besides something mushy and tasteless to quickly fill your stomach. And the tiny bits of meat in here try their best to overcome the mountain of mashed potatoes but unfortunately aren't up for the job. It's not that this one is bad, per say, but it's just one of those meals that blends into all the rest without ever being noticeable.<br /><br />For what this is -- a non-perishable prepared food that is fairly cheap -- it's pretty good. It will fill you up quickly at very low effort and cost, but if you are going to compare it to something you can make yourself, well, there really isn't any comparison.

review/text: I did not buy these from Amazon because I wanted to try them before committing to 6 of them. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />I don't mind the Chicken and dressing one, it's passable if one adds some salt, but this one is truly horrid.<br /><br />The beef wasn't ever 'steak'. It seems as though it probably is a round cut, therefore once stewed, it was tough, dry and tasteless. They would have been well-advised to have used chuck in an application like this. It was most certainly not 'tips' of anything of a true steak grade beef.<br /><br />The mashed potatoes were from powder originally and they were bland and sticky.<br /><br />The gravy was awful; pasty, tasteless and there was no beef flavor to it whatsoever.<br /><br />Having tried the other flavor once and having found it not too bad, I had high hopes that Hormel had finally improved on this line. I have been living with several roommates and food theft from the refrigerator has become rampant, ergo the need for something shelf-stable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this isn't going to become one of my staples. I cannot recommend this for anyone with intact taste buds.

review/summary: Traditional Health
review/text: Having been told of the beneficial effects of apple cider vinegar by a beloved 80-yr old naturopath/ chiropractor in the 1980's, it certainly took me long enough (the last 2 years)to develop the fond habit of regular ingestion: 1-2 oz in 6-8 oz water (You can play with the dilution factors to find your own balance between the bitter and the sweet, much like life itself!). It is now my "with meals" and evening drink (iced), replacing sodas, sweetened drinks, even my old favorite lime water,and I appreciate this particular product with its unapologetic flavor of apple.1-2 glasses daily have replaced my need for pills and antiacids.<br /><br />The tradition of drinking vinegar water extends back for centuries: Revolutionary soldiers at Valley Forge and in the Carolinas, Roman Centurians, (not to mention Jesus on the Cross, per the Biblical story), and likely even earlier in history.<br /><br />Modern benefits (check out Edgar Cayce)include relief of acid stomach and reflux symptoms, which I deeply appreciate.<br /><br />If I were soaking a body part in cider vinegar, I'd buy a cheaper, by the gallon product, but Braggs in in my opinion, is the only version I'd use for regular ingestion.

review/text: For years I've suffered from almost daily headaches. I have chronic sinusitis. I began using this vinegar 3 months back and now I rarely have a headache. I was able to discontinue the prescription nasal spray. This is a huge savings to me plus the prescription drug had some scary side effects. This was a complete surprise to me as I was using this vinegar for improvements in skin and other things that I had read about. I am ecstatic about this stuff. Use this if you suffer from constant headaches.

review/summary: This venegar ruined a perfectly good recipe.
review/text: I used this in one of my favorite recipes last week with disasterous results. It completely over powered all other ingedients and flavor elements in the dish and left my kitchen with the string, unmistakable aroma of vinegar. I could barely finish a small serving and sent the left-overs straight to the garbage disposal. Yuck.<br /><br />I gave it to my mohter who frequently drinks vinegar for medicinal purposes. For direct ingestion, she thought it was much more palatable than other vinegars she has tried.<br /><br />Rather a tale of two cities on this one. I guess one's opinoin of this product simply comes down to the capacity in which one plans to use it. It appears that this is good to drink. I will, however, never cook with it again.

review/summary: Great maple syrup
review/text: This is really good maple syrup.  We've taken to using maple syrup in place of sugar in a lot of our cooking so we go through a lot of it.  I've had a chance to try a lot of brands and this is one of my favorites.  It's a medium amber so it's got a mild flavor that doesn't overwhelm whatever your using it in or on (if you like yours strong go with a Grade B from Highland Sugarworks).  When I can't get this I usually buy the "Shady Maple Farms" brand which is as good but usually more expensive.  Plus many years ago I was in the Army with a Sergeant Coombs who was from New England and I thought, who knows?  Maybe it's his family?  Okay probably not, but it's an entertaining thought.

review/summary: Good syrup, but a bit runny
review/text: This can be had for a great bargain on occasion when it is put on sale. Works out to be significantly cheaper than the grocery store.<br /><br />Once you try real 100% pure organic maple syrup, you will never go back to the 2% Maple Syrups that you buy from the big names in the grocery store. There is NO comparison in taste quality.<br /><br />My only complaint with the Coombs is that it tends to be a bit runnier than some of the other brands out there. Which means you tend to use more of it, than what you would with a thicker syrup.

review/text: I have always purchased Grade A dark amber Maple syrup from local Kroger and have really come to love the taste of it. However that brand is relatively expensive and I was thinking this organic version would taste as good but I was wrong. This version is thin and watery and does not have much of Maple taste to it.<br /><br />Since my supply ran out I have have gone back to purchasing the Kroger version pending when I will find alternative in the amazon subscribe & Save store. In the mean time I will try the 'Coombs Grade A Dark Amber' for comparison. I use it in my breakfast oatmeal and Green Tea.

I love its lighter texture than many other maple syrups, and it obviously beats any of the non-maple syrups. This syrup is good enough that small amounts make a great sugar substitute\addition on many things, such as my morning toast, or added to many different types of recipes, instead of sugar. For me, a small amount goes a long way on pancakes, etc. This syrup is great, because you can truly taste the maple and it's not a chemical, and\or molasses mess!

review/summary: Moldy Syrup
review/text: I purchased the Coombs Family Farm's Maple Syrup like I always have done.  However when I opened it, the  top was covered in  green mold.  I used this time to educate my son on famous molds.  One in particular was mold that makes penicillin.  Penicillin had been discovered years before, but when WWII came it became very urgent to find a mold that produced penicillin in a very high concentration.  So the research was being done In Peoria, Illinois and all the housewives in Peoria were instructed to bring all there moldy food to the lab. It was moldy cantaloup where the important mold was found.  I don't think the syrup was growing a mold that produced penicillin-no it was just plain gross.  The syrup was not that old so maybe I will look at other syrup.

review/text: Oh my! This Naan is so good. I love that it cooks up easily in the oven - no need to even thaw - just grab out the freezer and into the oven. The bread comes out hot, chewy, and delicious. I can eat it plain, but have had some amazing Indian themed dinners with other Tandoor Chef ingredients and rice. Just yummy and I will continue to purchase. The price appears high at first, but once you taste the quality you will not mind paying - I promise!

review/summary: Great for pizza
review/text: I use these primarily to make pizza -- they're a great size for (smaller) individual pies and provide a deliciously chewy crust. (My trick is to top and bake them while they're still frozen, since if they thaw before they're baked when used for pizza, they can get a bit overdone as the cheese turns golden.) Great naan, and I don't have to make the trek to Whole Foods to get them, which is great since the WF nearby has a tendency to run out!

review/text: I like the flavor and enjoy this type of bread. This was my 3rd order and it can be eaten with many different dishes. Also, by adding sauce, cheese and other ingredents, it makes a great base for making a chrispy pizza.

review/summary: Thoughts from a virgin mate drinker
review/text: This is the first brand of yerba mate I have tried. I found it really pleasant and will definitely buy it again. I was hesitant that it might be too bitter or overpowering, but it wasn't at all. Just make sure to use hot, not boiling water, to steep it. I love sweet drinks, so I added a little honey and YUM! I drink it every morning, and after about a week of doing this, I really have noticed that I am more clear headed and have more energy throughout the day. It also cuts my appetite! I never used to drink caffeinated drinks because they usually make me anxious and jittery (1 soda would do this to me) but this mate is great. I have had no 'crashes' or jitters or anxiety at all. So, if you are new to this drink and want to give it a try, start with the Rosamonte brand.

review/text: I really liked this particular mate. I have been a mate drinker for over 10 years and this one ranks toward the top with a solid, smooth taste.. The only reason that I didn't give them 5 stars was because I think that they should give you the 1 kilo bag for the price.

review/summary: My fav...
review/text: I'm no connoisseur of fine Mattes. I've only tried a few brands, but Rosamonte is my favorite so far. I think the flavor is stronger than others and the loose leaf mix is just the right grade: not too dusty and fine and its not like, straight up leaves either. Its pretty much perfect for probably any type of filter. Also, I don't think there were too many sticks and stems as fillers in the bag. I'm pretty sure the bag Cruz de Malta that I ordered had a bit more of that (although apart from this minor discrepancy, I remember Cruz de Malta being practically indistinguishable from Rosamonte). In any case, I will surely order Rosamonte again for my loose leaf Yerba Matte fulfillments.

review/text: We have always liked Green Mountain Coffee, especially the flavored coffees like French Vanilla.  Has a pleasant taste and does not have the bitterness that some other coffees have at times.  Instead of having to brew an entire pot of coffee for just a few cups, the K-Cups are perfect for a single fresh cup of coffee whenever the urge arises.  We would highly recommend it to all !!

In fact, the Red Bush tea has 50 times the anti oxidants as green tea.<br /><br />The Huckleberry was a bit too fruity for me and the smell is overpowering in my storage cabinet.

review/summary: A taste from my childhood
review/text: Quaker has always made high quality products using grits.  I was born and raised in Louisiana, the real "Deep South".  Ever morning, my grandmother would make a bowl of Quaker grits to go along with my scrambled egg, toast and milk.  If you say you are from the South, but have never tasted the pleasures of grits, then you are not from the true "South".<br /><br />I have been using "Quaker's" instant grits for years because I never had the time in the morning to cook the regular grits.  Even though they are not ordinary grits, they still have the flavor and mouth feel that brings back the memories of those mornings, sitting in the kitchen, watching my grandmother making breakfast.<br /><br />They can be made as creamy or stiffer as you like by adding more or less water.  You can add cheese, bacon bits or other ingredients to the cooked instant grits.  It is way faster than the regular grits and also the "fast" grits.  I always keep a box or two of the instant grits, along with the regular grits, in my pantry.<br /><br />Thank you, Quaker, for bringing back so many wonderful memories of my early days!!

review/text: I saw these mentioned on a raw foods site and decided to check them out. I just tried them for the first time. I snipped open the bag and ate one... and then another and another. I had to finally force myself to use some self control and stop munching on them. I like olives well enough, but there's a savory richness to these that could well make them addicting... moist chewy texture, tasty tartness, not too salty. I can think of a few recipes I'd like to try these olives in, if I can keep myself from snacking on the whole bag of them "as is." I just ordered another bag because I don't think this one will last very long.

Also, anything you have to saute can be simmered in this instead. It really cuts down on the fat!! Everyone should have a jar of this in their kitchen.
