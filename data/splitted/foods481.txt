review/text: Seemingly useless. Got it for my husband that cooks, and also appreciates things that are aesthetically pleasing, but I wanted some USE out of it. It sits on the kitchen windowsill collecting dust but still pretty. So if you want to get a deco piece, sure get it. But don't expect to use it.

A few things to know, when you first receive it don't be put off by the intensity of the smell, even with the jar closed you can smell it,.....this will eventually cease and stay within the confines of the jar.

review/summary: Great Coffee/tea substitue!
review/text: A couple years back I developed an intolerance to caffeine that sent me to the emergency room.  I have been seaching for a substitute but nearly every similar product contains varying amounts of caffeine.  Even decaf coffees and teas still contan a small amount of the drug.  Two months back I ordered two 100 bag boxes of Windsor and it has been a great substitue for my morning coffee.  I still miss that kick I got from my morning cup of coffee but that is one experience I do not wish to repeat.<br /><br />Coca tea has a very delicate taste but the taste is enhanced with a small amount of sugar is added.  Honey has such a distinctive flavor of its own that it would totally mask the flavor of the coca tea.<br /><br />I spent over two years in Bolivia with the Peace Corps and the tea brings back fond memories of my days in that country.<br /><br />Would I purchase the product again?  Yes!  In fact, I have already ordered two more boxes.

review/text: Much has already be said about this fine product and it would be hard to<br />add  to all the existing great  reviews. I find this excellent product<br />to be complementary to Yerba Mate as well. I combine the two mates by<br />making strong yerba mate  sun tea and then steeping the coca tea bags in the first sun tea ( once again in the sun ) making  Cocayerb Mate. For my tastes the two work well in concert, I find that the properties of both mates combine nicely.<br />  I add a small amount of sugar to my cocayerb mate because I drink it as a dark tea. Cocayerb might be a little intense for those people that don't like coffee due to it's stimulating effects. The speed and efficiency of the Amazon ordering and delivery process is very  commendable as  well.

review/text: I spent a few weeks in Peru and loved the Coca Tea.  I brought some back with me and was bummed that I was almost out.  But then I found Amazon has it and life is good again.  Coffee gives you the jitters and caffeine actually strips you body of vitamins, none of this with Coca Tea.  In truth the Coca Leaf has proteins, vitamins and minerals essential to your body. Ingesting the leaf is NOT addictive and is in fact very healthy.  It is a bit expensive but ones health is worth it.  Besides the Tea tastes wonderful without side effects like upset stomach, jitters, etc. of caffeine!

review/summary: Be advised: All coca teas in the US are DECOCAINIZED
review/text: This tea is pleasant and drinkable, not unlike a number of oriental green teas I've tried.<br /><br />I learned (after ordering) that all coca teas sold in the US are "decocainized" (check wikipedia... hence the "export quality" that appears on all of these coca teas.)<br /><br />So this is the coca-tea equivalent of decaf-coffee.  I certainly don't blame the sellers or the products for this unfortunate fact (although they certainly don't volunteer the info), I do blame those who have taken our freedoms to chose what we put in our bodies... thanks all you "drug warriors" for restricting what teas I can enjoy.<br /><br />I think many drinkers of these decocainized teas are waking up to the fresh smell of a tasty placebo. Sorry to spoil the party.<br /><br />So: two stars, because it's hard to feel good about paying $75 for what is essentially just green tea... even if it might "help with digestion".  I certainly have not found it to be better at waking me up in the morning than my usual yerba mate.

review/summary: Be Aware about getting ilegal coca tea
review/text: I have been buying coca tea and coca products for over a year and I love them! I was happy to see that I could buy at a cheaper price at Amazon.com from a different seller than Bolivia Stores but it was a nightmare, please be careful and aware of this facts:<br /><br />I order a coca tea box from Bolivia Exports, the package was very late and took over two weeks for arrival when I got used to the "less than a week USA shipping", this package was mailed directly from Bolivia and not from North Carolina where I usually get my coca products shipped from. I received a custom open package with green tape all over, tea bags where opened and ripped apart, the box was cut open all around and I can send as many pictures as required..... but the worse part is that with it , I got a Custom, DEA and FDA warning letters that the coca tea box was getting in the United States without licences for schedule II substances from a no registered seller for what it was a 100% illegal package from Bolivia that I needed to sign for and get my name as importer of ILEGAL GOODS; the product was not intended for human consumptions because it was not from a FDA certified location.<br />How is possible that Amazon can aloud sellers without licencing for controlled substances and food in its pages??? I called "Bolivia Stores" and found out that they are an American company with all paperwork, licencing, FDA registered facilities and permissions while this is a different seller from Bolivia not linked to them in any way.<br /><br />I want my money back, I receive a product that cannot be used and I will contact my credit card company with the complain also but now, who fix the problem I have with Customs US???<br /><br />I tried to save a few dollars and got a whole headache and lost every penny in a tea that cannot be drink

review/summary: An experience worth having.
review/text: This tea has a smoothe earthy flavor. It definitely fits into the catagory of organic health foods for its purported nutritional content as well.  The energy I personally felt was very subtle, not much like so many dietary supplements and drinks out there that gets one juiced up to the point of jitters. If taken for the first time, a slight numbing sensation can be felt in the mouth and throat areas.  The sensitivity to the numbing sensation appears to fade a bit with ongoing consumption. As far as an appetite suppressant for me, it works to a slight degree, probably depending on the amount. According to one coca tea blogspot website, the coca leaf contains 14 alkaloids:  Atropine, Inuline, Benzoyne, Reserpine, Cocamine, Conine, Quinoline, Pyridine, Globuline, Hygrine, Papaine, Pectin, Egnonin, and Cocaine--one gram of crushed leaves contains 5.3mg of which only 4.42mg of it is released during a 3 minute steep in 180ml of hot water.<br /><br />  Of the listed alkaloids, Cocamine is becoming popular in dietary supplement blends that are geared towards those needing energy for workouts and such.  From my personal experience ALRI's Venom Hyperdrive is a good synergistic blend of vitamin b-12, cocamine,hoodia gordinii, etc. that have worked well for me in getting appetite supression and high energy for workouts.<br /><br />  By the way, the natives supposedly use a minute amount of an alkalinic additive to enhance the potency (by improving extraction) of the coca leaf's alkaloids.  They are little ash/lime balls called Llipita(available online) and they can be pulverized and sprinkled upon your beverage like pinches of salt. Oh, and what a conversation piece--a definite novel-tea!

review/text: Many years ago I visited South America and tried the tea made with a small amount of fresh leaves. It felt mildly stimulant, but not pleasant.<br />When I came accross the coca tea in Amazon.com, I was so surprised that I decided to try it.<br />I was sure it was thoroughly decocainized, so I doubted I was going to enjoy the Freudian benefits, but I hoped for traces of the alkaloid being left behind.<br />The tea does contain cocaine, but so little that it doesn't make you feel high. Instead, for me and my partner at least, the tea is as calming as alertness promoting. It is mildly stimulant, but at the same time one feels relaxed and somehow more in control.<br />The flavor of Windsor tea is much more pleasant than that of green tea and is also more complex. No wonder Coca Cola still uses the plant (??).<br />Will it still be legal next time I, an adult, decide to buy a new box? Certainly hope so.

review/summary: Safety Instructions for coca tea
review/text: All NovoAndina Products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags.<br />NovoAndina products do not contain preservatives or additives; therefore they must be properly stored. All our Air Tight Bags are re-sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry, cool, dark place away from strong-flavored foods.  An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month.<br />Do not store NovoAndina products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Our teas are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels. Although not hazardous to humans, the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea.

review/summary: A great gourmet tea
review/text: This tea is not the "Cure for all Mankind diseases" as many could be expecting, after three years commercializing this brand and other coca teas from Peru and Bolivia we have received all kinds of reviews, some people love it as an after meal tea, some do it to get away from coffee, some girls use it for menopause symptoms and others for PMS.<br />Several reviews we had can be used as evidence that coca products are good for backache, migraines and headaches.  I have also heard that many customers have consumed it to relieve depression or to reduce anxiety medication. In the other hand, some people do not experience any extra energy and only use it as a healthy herbal tea. It is impossible to expect that a simple tea bag with only one gram of dried - crushed coca leaves can be good for everybody and for everything! I just think is worth trying and see how your body reacts to it.<br />Personally, I have been using this tea since I am a kid for stomachaches and indigestion ( easy to get them when you are a chocolate's addict) and in the last years as ice tea while I workout or mixed with my protein shake for extra energy , it keeps me hydrated and my stomach surely enjoys it. So far I can use my same old Blue Jeans from 8 years ago but it is not all coca tea and coca products are not the miracle factor, I try to keep a healthy diet and I really try to workout at least 4 times at week.<br />Lately, I have added the coca flour to my kids diet in Bolivia, they are 10 years old twins, finicky eaters and their last medical showed them underweight and because coca is full of vitamins, minerals and calcium, I decided to give them some powdered coca every day. They get it in smoothies with yogurt and fruits, pudding, cake, bread, pasta and sauces and God knows all the recipes I have been trying the last weeks .......So far, my girl has shown a big weight improvement and I am hopping my boy can show that kind of progress in a near future.

review/summary: Windsor Coca Tea Not So Great
review/text: Well, it just came yesterday, 100 tea bags of Windsor, supposed to be the best. I made a pitcher of 20 tea bags by boiling the water, boiling again, letting it sit, putting a tea bag in my mouth and sucking and see if it would numb it. No not noticible at all, no wonder its legal in the US, stupid Coca tea! I heard if you put 3 in your mouth and suck on it for a while it will get numb, but I don't feel like doing that. I'm on my 3rd cup of iced tea today and I think I'm gonna just get a sugar-free monstor or drink expresso. Do I feel stimulated? Slightly. Do I feel sober? Yes. Alert? Yes. Energetic? Not particularly, and the fact its 65 degrees in the house doesn't help, I like warmth. Is it real Coca leaves? Yes, but dried and apparently from my research it would take 100 bags to equal 1 gram of coke. Does that mean 100 bags of fresh? I dont know. Why is it legal? Because there are not enough alkaloids in the tea to be considered an illegal substance, kinda like poppy seeds or the essence of coca you will see in the ingredients of coca-cola. It's also known to calm the cravings of cocaine users, although I don't have cravings any way, but if you do it's recommended.<br /><br />I'm now brewing one cup with 3 bags and seeing if I can tell anything...I pour the boiling water on the 3 bags. It has a nice green grassy color, similiar to green tea. It's quite delicious and as I drink it down my mood is slightly lifted, heart beat increases, but no more than with caffeine. Is it like cocaine? No, not at all and if you buy the tea hoping it's going to be that way, you've got another thing coming and will be very disappointed. I knew all this before I decided to try this. I'm not disappointed, yet not entirely enthusiastic about it either.<br /><br />It's a good alternative for thoughs who don't like coffee, it has a vast amount of vitamins, minerals and health benefits and is certainly better for you than caffeine. Also, surprisingly, no jitters like with coffee. Is it like doing a drug? No, not at all, I feel completely sober, yet my spirits are lifted a bit and a slight tingle, but it could be b/c I'm trying to feel something. I can see why it would be legal in the U.S not to mention it helps the trade commission in a safe legal way. And I'm not just saying that to keep it legal, everything I read about it not being anything like a drug has been true. I just didn't know until I tried it.<br /><br />After drinking the entire pitcher I was very giddy, but that was probably just the mood I was in naturally.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Probably not, it's rather expensive. I'll just drink my cuban expresso, I like caffeine better than coca tea.

review/text: Red Zinger is the tea that made Celestial Seasonings famous.  This was the must-have tea in the seventies.  Every well stocked hippie cupboard had to have this tea next to the brown rice and soy sauce.  But it is the healthful ingredients and classic flavor that keep it an enduring favorite.

First consumed by the ancient Egyptians, Hibiscus tea has diuretic qualities, can lower blood pressure, and has minerals and flavonoids.  The second ingredient, rose hips, are very high in vitamin C and are used in herbal medicine to prevent urinary tract infections.  Other ingredients include peppermint, lemon grass, orange peel, lemon myrtle, licorice and wild cherry bark.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Passion colors all that it touches in its own hues."

review/summary: Red Zinger Tea Bags
review/text: I was really happy to find the Red Zinger Tea Bags available on Amazon.  I looked in all the grocery stores around my house and it is gone...<br />I have an iced tea recipe using Red Zinger and apple juice which is delicious. I do not drink the Red Zinger alone so I cannot evaluate it like that.  I certainly hope Celestial Seasonings has not discontinued it.  Thank you so much for providing it on Amazon! I like that it is Caffeine free. Here is the recipe and I hope it causes  you to buy the tea so it will not be discontinued.<br />Rose Tea<br />6 Celestial Seasonings Red Zinger  (large) tea bags<br />1  46-oz apple juice<br />3 orange slices<br />3 lemon slices<br />Add water to fill one gallon.<br />Let sit for 18 hours before serving****  (PLAN AHEAD)

review/summary: Flavorful, moist and convenient!
review/text: I was very happy with these dried apricots. They were clearly superior to more expensive product I purchased at my local supermarket. They have a very nice flavor and there were no tough, overly dry pieces as I have found in other products. The one pound container is very convenient and, in my kitchen, was suitable for storage after opening. My box of six one-pound containers arrived in good shape, perhaps because it was part of a larger, well packed order. I intend to order the product again.

review/summary: terrible
review/text: firstly, the packaging. all of the tubs were opened, plastic cracked, tubs lids do not fit the bowls so they can't actually close and seal the contents, it looked like one tub was eaten out of, apricots missing. Looks like this stuff gets shipped from turkey and they repackage it in Brooklyn into really lousy packaging that does not fit. i used to live in Brooklyn, that place is full of rats. the fact that all the tubs came opened, lids don't fit, and plastic seal is broken is beyond disgusting. i can only imagine under what circumstances they were repacked down there in brooklyn. again disgusting.<br /><br />finally these are not Natural Apricots, they are full of Sulfur Dioxide for preservative. If i could give this mess a negative 5 stars I would.

review/summary: True turkish apricots
review/text: I love apricots and have been fortunate to have travelled to Turkey and had real Turkish dried apricots.  While traveling there I had found there were definite differences in size, taste, quality and freshness.  These imported Turkish apricots are very good quality with excellent flavor and consistency.  Having read the previous reviews I was concerned about the packaging, however they came in perfect shape.  They are very well packaged - six clear plastic tubs arrived in their own cardboard box (like a six-pack of bottled beer) covered in clear plastic all around, and packaged again in amazon's usual box with air pillows.  if the tubs get broken, then the two boxes they are all contained in have to get crushed as well.  A great product and I will gladly purchase them again.

review/summary: Nice
review/text: This brand's attributes are nicely positioned between Harmony (tough) and Sun Maid (soft and sticky). The pieces are large: only 5 per quarter cup as opposed to 6 for the other two brands. I had no problems with the packaging: the plastic film seal was intact on all my containers. The plastic containers are thin and brittle, so I guess they could break with rough handling.

But to be honest I'm disappointed with the TARTE Chocolate Cake Mix. "Spongy" isn't really the descriptive word... It's actually "rubbery". I am a true die hard chocoholic but the overwhelming chocolate bitterness in aroma and flavor and combined with the rubbery texture...

A truck rolled up around 10 and my standard was the 6 Lorna Doone sleeve and the large coffee.  25-cents BTW<br /><br />FIVE STAR DOWN TO ONE!!!!<br />Added 3/12: Well, I just got another deal.  Seems affordable with deals and anything but when not featured.  The above indicates a lifelong relationship.  I should know the taste.  This case of cookies is different and not a good different.  Even the texture is off.<br /><br />The expiration date appears to be 14May12.  Still in spec but close and if poorly stored you get rancid.  The price was almost $2/box cheaper and close to grocery store prices.  I have figured out why it went from $50+ to 30's.<br /><br />WHAT MAKES ME MAD IS THAT I WENT TO AMAZON RETURNS AND THIS ITEM IS NOT ELIGIBLE.  AMAZON ALWAYS IMPRESSED ME ON RETURNS.  DISAPPOINTING. VERY DISAPPOINTING!  These went from a lovely treat to a reward for my dog.

review/summary: LORNA DOONE SHORTBREAD COOKIES 5-OUNCE SLEEVE(PACK OF 12)
review/text: Lorna Doone's is a delicious buttery shortbread cookie that melts in your mouth if eaten alone or as a cookie to accompany your morning coffee or tea, as well as a perfect breakfast treat. Recently in October through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon and shipped for free, I picked up 2 cases of 12 boxes that are 5oz. packages each with approximately 20 shortbread cookies per package for $12.99/case = $25.98 for 24 total 5oz. sleeves of Lorna Doone's. I point this price comparison out to help educate my fellow buyers of this product, seeing that in your local supermarket they're retailing for around $4.49-$4.99 for each 10oz. box containing 2 of the 20 count cookie packages in each. Now that is the same EXACT equivalent as 2 of the 5oz. sleeve packages that I purchased containing 12 boxes per case. Amazon frequently sells the 10oz. boxes in a pack of 12 for around $46-$52. Buying it my way for around $26 is economically smart and can save you as much as 50% off the listed above reference! Have fun and ENJOY!

review/text: The cookies arrived intact--none of the boxes I've opened so far had even one cracked cookie. The 12 boxes were packed snuggly into a medium box, which makes for easy storage in the basement pantry (as opposed to the usual gigantic box from Amazon with tons of paper).<br /><br />These cookies are really good, especially with coffee. They have a buttery flavor, and they're not too sweet. I originally bought them for my daughter--she loves them. But I really like them too.

If you order something that lists Strawberry as its flavor and then act surprised that it's not licorice-root flavor, you're an idiot.

review/summary: Marvelous wafers, badly damaged thanks to Amazon's packaging
review/text: The refrigerator cake made with these wafers, which my mother called "Famous Dessert" when she made it at the end of the 1930's, is what my kids renamed "Favorite Dessert" and it's now that for the grandkids too.  The delicate wafers themselves are dry and crisp.  Their taste seems nothing too special if you eat them straight -- but being layered and covered with whipped cream and a few hours in the refrigerator brings about an easy transformation into a luscious and intense chocolate experience.  There is no refrigerator dessert close to it.<br /><br />But today's packaging is less protective of these wafers than were the long metal cylinders with screw tops that protected those of my childhood memories. I often need to sort through the boxes on groceries shelves to find ones with no more than one or two broken wafers.  So I welcomed a chance to buy a carton. Closely packed and sent straight to me, I told myself, they would arrive intact, and I'd have a supply for many impromptu dinner parties.<br /><br />WRONG.  The unexpectedly large carton that arrived today proved to be part of a naive attempt at the double-boxing often used to ship fragile things. Unfortunately, Amazon's packer didn't really understand the concept.  The only cushioning included in the ample spaces between that large carton and the inner one with the wafers was one strip of 4 plastic pouches partly filled with air.  The inner box seemed to have been bouncing around a lot during transport, by the glimpses of the number of broken wafers in the boxes inside. I braced myself to go to the trouble of sending the order back -- I can find less damaged ones (at a lower price) on local shelves.<br /><br />And guess what?  After filling out a feedback report on the packaging problem, I went to arrange a return -- and was told that the product in that order was not returnable.  No reason given, and no warning on the listing either.<br /><br />Now I can understand that Amazon has no use for 12 boxes of damaged wafers.  But you know something?  Neither do I.<br /><br />Yes, I hope Nabisco continues to be carry them forever.  But I'll get mine locally from now on, and suggest that you might be wise to do so too. You can grate one broken wafer over the top and add an extra bit of that wonderful chocolate taste as well as a nice contrast to the white of whipped cream. But one is all it takes, not half a dozen or more.

review/summary: Really dissappointed, and yes grossed out as well! BEWARE!!
review/text: I love the flavor of these dark chocolate crispy wafers! I love the flavor so much, that I often will drink a cup of coffee and savor one or two of these treats when I need a quick pick me up.  Sometimes I break off a small bite-size piece of cookie and place it in my mouth, then quickly sip my hot coffee, allowing the wafer to melt, and the two flavors to meld into a lovely mocha blend.<br /><br />This morning I was aghast at finding tiny intruders ruining my mid-morning break.  Granted, these interlopers did not willingly join me in my private tasting, they had died long (?) ago during the baking process of these Famous Chocolate Wafers.  This morning, not only did I encounter the lovely mocha blend flavor on my tongue, but also small chunks of what I initially thought might be coconut.  IT WAS NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />What I encountered was larvae (about 1/8" in length, light yellowish brown)as well as full-size bodies of the adult bugs (also about 1/8" long)and husk-like fiber --- none of these are easily confused with coconut. I couldn't believe my eyes (or tongue), so I took an intact wafer from the box, placed it on a saucer, and melted it in a small amount of tap water.  Again I made the same startling discovery -- GROSS -- and immediately called the phone number on the box.<br /><br />I requested that someone follow-up with me to report the findings, but apparently, Nabisco/Kraft does not wish to be held accountable to its customers when dissatisfaction occurs. So BEWARE . . .

review/text: It was great to find that Amazon still made these great chocolatey wafers available.  It is almost impossible to find at the local stores.  It seems that Nabisco is doing away with many of our old favorites like these great chocolate wafers and crackermeal.  The only wish I would have is if we could buy in smaller quantities at a time.  There were a few boxes that were cracked into pieces rather than whole,however not affecting the great taste in any way.

review/summary: Nabisco Famous Wafer Dessert
review/text: My Mom used to make this dessert with Nabisco Famous Wafers when we were kids. It's just whipped cream to start, cookie then about 3/16 inch or so of whipped cream in between cookies until cookies or cream is gone. Save enough cream to cover cookies. You can stack horizontally of vertically depending on your container (I like a glass loaf pan). You let sit covered in the fridge for at least 24 hours, 48 is better so the cookies get soft. You can shave some milk chocolate curls for the top if you want.  I took it to my brothers house for Christmas and it was like a time machine that took them all back to when they were little as soon as they tasted it. Simple and very sinful, not diet though.<br /><br />ASIN:B000FA38ZE Famous Chocolate Wafers, 9-Ounce  Boxes (Pack of 12)<br /><br />Whipped cream: 2 cups heavy cream, 4 tablespoons of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla beat into a cream.<br /><br />Remember that whipped cream will pick up tastes in fridge. There was a year that some polish sausage in the fridge had it's way with the cream, it was nasty.<br /><br />Thanks! Tom

review/summary: Heaven in a box!
review/text: After searching fruitlessly in the grocery stores in my area for these cookies that were the base for a favorite dessert when I was young (the recipe is STILL on the box decades later!), I finally found them on Amazon.  I ordered a case (pack of 12 boxes) so that I could send some to each of my kids, shared a box with a neighbor and kept some for myself.  Living alone, I don't have a good reason for making a full recipe of the dessert, but I can make a 1-serving portion easily, and I also have discovered a couple other delights.  I use two cookies and a serving spoon sized amount of ice cream - my favorite is coffee ice cream - and I've got my own ice cream sandwich with a crunchy cookie outside and creamy ice cream inside.  Takes 1 minute, because it's ready to eat right then and there.  I also have been known to crumble one cookie as topping for a small dish of ice cream.  The cookie is not as sweet as a typical cookie so it doesn't compete with the ice cream.  It complements it.<br /><br />I've also used it crushed as a topping for a cream pie, and I've used the cookies instead of graham crackers to make my own chocolate crumb pie crust - instant ice cream pie when you add slightly softened ice cream and your favorite toppings.  These cookies are the best!  (Add a bit of firm frosting between two cookies and you have your own version of a popular sandwich cookie, too.)

I know of no person who, after tasting it, has not made it their favorite dessert.  We had twelve people at our house for Thanksgiving.  Some were suspicious of our ravings.  After they had it for dessert they couldn't stop eating it.  The next day we got several phone calls asking us if their were any pieces left.  Unfortunately, most were disappointed due to the ravenous actions the night before.  The legend goes on.

review/summary: A Family Favorite Baking Essential you should always have on hand!  Hard to find in stores these days.
review/text: These old-fashioned chocolate wafer cookies are the key ingredient in many recipes. Even Martha Stewart uses them on her show as the bottom of her Ice-cream Bon-Bons. In my family, they are used as the key ingredient in what is often called "Ice-Box Cake" or refrigerator cake which is layered chocolate wafers between some type of creamy filling such as sweetened marscapone cheese or cool-whip type preparation. For additional "oomph" you can crumble them on top of the pan of "cake" for decoration.  If you have any of the classic Martha Stewart Cookbooks or follow the new trends in Food Design through fancy cupcake books or Family Fun Magazine , you'll fiind these wafers mentioned with great frequency as an essential ingredient.  One can also modify the basic Ice-Box cake recipe that this Wafer is famous for  and add cocoa to the whipping cream to create an inexpensive and alternative B�che de No�l Dessert centerpiece (the traditional French Yule Log cake) for the holidays without having to bake a jelly roll cake and hope that it doesn't break as you roll it up!  I admit, I've done that myself at least twice and recieved nothing but compliments.  All you have to do is add some chocolate mushrooms & some Marzipan or Fondant forest creatures  to the scene and you're all set!<br /><br />These wafers are becoming harder and harder to find in grocery stores so most bakers order them by the case, as they are offered here,  since they keep well on the shelf and are so versatile. You can make simple icre-crem sandwiches with them by smoothing softened ice-cream between them or you can dress them up by then enrobing them in melted chocolate. They also jazz up any dessert as a simple decoration. In short...if you cook, bake or assemble desserts, you must have some of these in your pantry.<br /><br />The price here may seem a little steep but you are buying 12 packages which may be more than an average household will likely use in a year. However,  since these wonderful recipe basic cookie wafers are at the heart of so many family favorite desserts, I would suggest splitting an order with one other baker in your family since even the occasional baker could easily go thru 6 boxes in a year just by making a few recipes and snacking. By splitting a case order with a friend or family member, you each have what you need on hand for gatherings when an Ice-Box Cake is just the thing everyone needs to celebrate or if you are hoping to add a little ZING to a cupcake or Muffin recipe by placing one of these wafers at the bottom.  Incidentally, the Icebox Cake recipe is featured on the package and the photo show depiicts what it looks like when made in the traditional manner.  Ask around and once you mention the Ice-Box Cake, I'm sure you'll find a baking friend  who is very willing to split a case with you!

review/text: I wouldn't feed this to a pet.  Though the nutritional info shows '0 Trans Fats' the ingredients list shows "Partially Hydrogenated" oils... that is Trans Fats.  Basically, natural oils that have been modified by attaching two hydrogen molecules where they don't occur in nature.  The end result... the oil is solid a room temperature and creates a crispier product.  The impact to your health is that your system thinks it is oil (fat) and lets it into your blood stream where it is handled like a plastic.  You system doesn't know what to do with it and it is plastered on the walls of your arteries where it stays for a long long time.  Folks... if you care about Type 2 diabetes, cholesterol problems, altheimers disease... maybe more.  Keep these Trans Fats away from yourself and loved ones.  Also this material is hidden in names like "shortening" and "margarine".  Don't buy this... find a wafer that is safe.

After a bunch of looking around, I decided to try this one.<br /><br />When it came, I was shocked at the amount. For some reason I was expecting a couple handfuls, and got several dozen handfuls. When I was sifting through it, I noticed how fresh it looked, even dried, and the smell was wonderful. I mixed it in with the peppermint from the same company (and same great quality) and put that with the flax in the bag. It didn't take much to make it smell good (about a tablespoon of each per cup of flax). After being used again and again in the microwave, it still smells like it did the first day. I'm very pleased with the quality, and plan on buying only this brand in the future.<br /><br />Even the room I store it in smells fabulous.

review/summary: Beware - Kellogg's has reformulated this
review/text: At the suggestion of my doctor, I have been eating Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus cereal for breakfast every day for several years now. A few days ago I opened a new box and discovered they have made changes in this product.  What a shock. I absolutely hate the new product.  I do not like the taste, I do not like the color, I do not like the slimy texture in milk. I loved the old Special K Protein Plus. I liked the taste.  I Liked the color.  I liked the texture.  I looked forward to it every day.  It was a great way to begin my day.  Now I am in misery.  It's as if my best friend is no longer here.<br /><br />And I looked at the nutrition information and see that they have reduced the fiber from 5 grams to 3 grams per serving, a reduction of 40 percent.  And they increased the sugar from 2 grams to 7 grams per serving, an increase in dangerous empty calories by 250%. I do not need more sugar in my life.<br /><br />And the front of the box states "satisfies hunger longer--see side panel for details. I looked at the side panel and it says "Special K Protein products are designed to promote a reduced feeling of hunger by increasing daily intake of protein and fiber".  So they added this statement to the new box while at the same time they reduced fiber by 40%.  And they also reduced the amount of protein in the box by about 10% because they changed the serving size.  The old box had 13.2 servings and the new box only 11.96 servings.  Fool me once.  Shame on you. Fool me twice.  Shame on me.  I will not be eating Kellogg's products anymore.

review/text: The Tinkyada pastas are some of the best gluten free products on the market.  The taste and quality are excellent.  They are easy to cook and the result is very consistent.  The taste and texture are both very close to standard wheat pasta.  There are other pastas out there that come closer in taste and texture, but require a little more care in preparation.  For everyday use, Tinkyada is your best bet, as it comes out perfect every time, does not require any attention during cooking and has a rather large window for doneness (others seem to go from not quite done to overdone in less than 2 minutes).

review/text: We purchase these along with all the other shapes of Tinkyada pasta.  The shells are one of our favorites because, like the fusilli, they cook up a little quicker.  They're also a wonderful shape for a meat sauce since the little shells catch the meat particles.<br /><br />I really like Tinkyada pasta because, unlike other brands of rice pasta, I don't have to rinse the pasta. Another brand that is less expensive is very coated with a sort of gloppy film if I don't rinse it.<br /><br />The shells are also a fun shape for children.  We're crossing our fingers that Tinkyada will add some more shapes in the near future.  Also, we just love the subscribe and save option.  I stop people in the supermarket all the time and tell them about it.  Nothing beats a better price and having it delivered to my door!

review/summary: Not the best....
review/text: This pasta doesn't hold its shape and ends up a mushy mess, even after reducing the cooking time and rinsing in cold water.  Tinkyada spaghetti is an improvement over the shells, but I've been hesitant to try any other shapes after ended up with numerous bags of this mush.

review/summary: Best Gluten Free pasta ever
review/text: I am allergic to wheat and have tried many different brands and types of wheat free/gluten free pasta. The Tinkyada brand Rice pastas are the best I have found. The taste is very similar to standard white pasta. Rice pasta tends to have a mushy texture, even when undercooked, but when rinsed (as directed) the Tinkyada has a normal texture.

review/summary: As close to wheat noodles as you can get
review/text: I really enjoyed this product.  Before purchasing these I tried several different types of noodles.  The quinoa noodles I tried before this product took forever to cook and ended up being tougher than noodles with wheat in them.  They also tasted very different.  I like rice noodles a lot better because the cooking time, taste, and texture is comparable to a wheat noodle.

review/summary: The BEST of the best
review/text: These are so good, I've been eating Grandma Utz's for years.  When I moved to Fla I could not find them in the stores, nor nothing that compared to them. (I am a potato chip lover, I think it is my birthmark lol)  I began sending for them, I put on many pounds lol I've lost them since tho' :).  I am now ready to order some for my Birthday in August. Prompt shipping so I'll hold off a few weeks.  ;). SO about 2 times a year I send for them in bulk.  Valentines & August. If you have not tried them you are in for a real treat.  Keep in mind they are kettle cooked in LARD & a crunchy chip, but are out of this world to me!  Try them, you'll love them as well. ENJOY!  gjp-h

review/summary: About as good as a potato chip can be
review/text: My wife's father, who retired a few years ago, was a potato farmer. He knows a thing or two about potatoes. When he was operating the farm, he sold most of his potatoes to Frito-Lay where they ended up as Lay's Potato Chips. He would always "test" the new crop of potatoes by making his own potato chips. He'd use a mandoline slicer to create nice thick slices of potato and then would deep fry them. A couple minutes later there would be these awesome, thick sliced, perfectly cooked chips which then got a sprinkling of salt. Best chips I've ever had.<br /><br />Sorry for that long story, but these Gradma Utz Handcooked Potato Chips taste just like the chips my Father in law makes. They are awesome. They hold up to thick dips without cracking and breaking like some other well known "thin" chips do. I don't think chips could be much better than these.

review/summary: Best potato chip money can buy
review/text: If you are fortunate enough to remember Charles Chips and the potato chip delivery man who'd leave a tin of delicious hand-cooked chips on your doorsteps, these are the closest you'll get to that taste. Handcooked in lard and generously salted, nothing compares to these chips. Thick cut, they hold up to dipping better than ruffled chips, but why bother using a dip? These are delicious on their own with an intense potato-ey flavor and a rich porkiness you can only get from pure lard. A treat for the potato chip cognoscenti.

review/text: I don't know what to say aside from these are the best chips you can buy. Get them, you will not be disappointed. There is one problem though, I find it very hard to eat any less than a bag once they are opened. =)

review/summary: Nice summer treat!
review/text: There are two pouches in each box.  The first, you add water and vodka, if desired.  You can either chill the rehydrated product, or freeze it for a frozen treat.  We enjoyed the frozen preparation and are looking forward to trying it martini style.  The second pouch in the box is a green rimmer.  I applied the rimmer as described on the box, only to be surprised by salt.  The rimmer is described as sugar and is listed as sugar on the ingredients list.  The pouch was labled "green margarita" rimmer.  Clearly there was a mistake made during packaging.  The salty margarita rimmer does not compliment the drink.  Of the 4 boxes included in my order, 3 of the boxes contained the salty "green margarita" rimmer.  The fourth box has the correct "green apple martini" rimmer.  The sugar rimmer is an excellent addition to the drink.  The rimmer is a generous portion, so it will be enough for all 4 boxes, but be careful of the unpleasant salty rimmer.

review/text: Great value! Very fresh, and apparent good quality.  It will last me a looooong time.  Just wished they would be more specific about where it came from and how it was grown.  Would like to know if it came from a polluted area or not.  Label on package indicated it was from China.  Am hoping it was from a clean place.
