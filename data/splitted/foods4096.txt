review/text: I have been reading books on bonsai trees for quite some time. The wife surprised me with one for Christmas!<br /><br />It arrived in excellent condition! There where a couple of brown needles but I would expect that when its being shipped from so far away.<br /><br />I am doing a little blog on my progress of this tree.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Check it out and let me know what you think.

They're like $40 in stores around here.<br />Update: did not realize how finicky these are, shoulda bought an owners manual! I killed it within months. Not enough water i guess. left at the office over the long weekends. RIP bonsai tree

review/summary: cute lil starter bonsai tree
review/text: I ordered this for my husband for Father's day, they shipped Monday and got this Thursday. Quick delivery I'd say. I have not seen it when it had arrived, my husband did, and it actually came in good shape. Seemed like it was package great. It's already had it's leaves growing to the side, only saw maybe a couple of browning leaves, but overall looked great. This is our first time having a bonsai so we still are learning how to take care of them. My husband loves it, and still can't believe that this little tree was shipped from Ohio. Only gave 4 stars since we barely had this lil one for 24 hours. Otherwise, I am very happy with the purchase so far.

review/text: The bonsai in the photo is nothing like what I received.  I received a little tiny thing that is only 2 inches tall and isn't growing out to the side at all. I chose this bonsai  because it was growing sideways.  I know the actual plants vary but I thought that it would at least have some resemblance.  The quality of the plant isn't that great either.  It's mostly all stem and has very little green on it and even that has brown dead looking patches on it.

review/summary: Do not be fooled by the Picture
review/text: Naturally I did not expect the tree I bought to look exactly like the image, trees are natural and no two trees look alike. What is very deceptive is the size. The image is a horrible representation of what you actually receive. The tree and base in the image are much larger than what I received. The foliage achieved on the tree in the image is 2 to 3 times what you get. My tree is the size of a large piece of broccoli, with a small crown, it stands no more than 2 inches high. That is a generous measurement. It had no branches on it longer than it was high. I am a realist, however the image they provide is of a much older larger tree.

review/summary: i'm angry and confused!
review/text: (in response to the last glowing review)<br />Well then, why is what you're saying running totally counter to the care sheet that came with the bonsai boy juniper!?  That plus I'm positive it advertised "eligible for free shipping"--but alas I paid the 8.95 anyway. AND the picture is full and lush. Mine is pretty darn thin compared to that....... But the worst part is, the Bonsai Boy care sheet says specifically if you bring it indoors to keep it DARK. This is saying keep it well-lit while indoors. I live in Northern New England. It's too cold almost 6 months out of the year to keep it outdoors, and I chose Juniper because the reviews I read said it was a good beginner tree. Which is it, lit or dark indoors?

Each pound comes in a foil bag that should last for years if stored in a cool place.<br /><br />I only opened one bag, but I didn't see any "extras" in the bag - just mustard seed. This is so much cheaper than buying from the grocery store. I was paying  $2.50 for 1.5 oz there. Here it's not even $4/lb.

review/summary: Very tasty, but not a lot of fruit filling.  See my photo up top.
review/text: I've been eating one of these apple bars every day at work as an afternoon snack for about a year now.  I used to eat Special K bars, but I found the Health Valley Organic bars on Amazon, and the good reviews prompted me to try them.  One bar is 130 calories and is a tasty, satisfying, and relatively healthy snack.  I've gone through many boxes, and the bars are consistent in quality and always fresh.<br /><br />I'm knocking off one star because the photo on the box is very misleading.  The bars have nowhere near the amount of filling shown on the photo the box.  In fact, the difference is significant enough that I would say that the photo bears little resemblance to the actual product.  I've attached my own photo up top to show what the inside of the bar actually looks like.  I would estimate the filling actually makes up about 20% - 25% of the bar, whereas the box photo seems to show around 80% - 85% filling.

review/text: Nobody can argue with the taste. American food companies have the best chemical engineers, I mean chefs, money can buy. Despite being made with whole grain, these taste just as good as the regular Wheat Things. Looking on the back, however, it's not hard to see why. After flour, these things are basically sugar and high fructose corn syrup. They are cookies masquerading as crackers. Brilliant...<br /><br />Enjoy them, just don't think you're getting a healthy snack. You're getting a salty cookie.

review/text: This was yet another of my "impulse" buys.  I guess now it is getting to the point that you not only shouldn't go to the store hungry, you shouldn't browse amazon hungry either.  I've just always loved tootsie fruit rolls and seeing a 5 lb bag I just couldn't resist.  I'm eating some now while writing the review.  If you like them, this is a good supply!  Hope you enjoy and thanks for reading my review.

review/summary: SURPRISINGLY GOOD WAFFLES!
review/text: I was leary of an instant waffle mix, REALLY leary, so I read the reveiws here and made my decision to give this a try, so glad I did! Not only were they easy to prepare, they were great!  Oh I had a problem with the first few since my waffle maker is a bit old and the teflon coating was pretty much shot, so I sprayed the griddle with Pam, they are now perfect, and if my boyfriend loved them then you just KNOW they're great, (he's very picky...)  Highly recommended.  I freeze up the extras too and toast them when we want "instant" waffles.  Just recently purchased a new waffle maker (of course, from Amazon), can't wait to try this mix on that!

review/text: I bought this product to go with the waffle maker I purchased for my boyfriend's birthday.  We were both disappointed with the heavy, grainy texture, dense consistency and lackluster taste.  I even tried two more batches - one with more milk to lighten the batter and the other with some extra flavorings and sweeteners to add more flavor.  Unfortunately nothing worked and we ended up feeding the waffles to the dogs.  My suggestion: if you want light, flavorful waffles - don't buy this product.

review/summary: Best Ever !!
review/text: I have been buying the Krusteaz Belgian Waffle mix for close to 10 yrs now. I have tried other more expensive brands but kept coming back to Krusteaz. I found them to be the lightest and crispiest out of all the brands I tried. I just follow the directions on the box and have had no problem at all. I have used the same DeLonghi Retro round belgian waffle maker every time. Also use a grade A medium pure maple syrup. Not sure if that has anything to do with it, but found this to be a winning combination. Have given the waffle maker to family as gifts and recommend the Krusteaz mix and they in turn use it too! Only thing is I purchase the mix locally @ Wegmans for only $2.99 for a 28 oz. box.

review/summary: Tasty, a bit of heat, and versatile as a base for other dishes
review/text: This is a very nice, versatile item in Jyoti's lineup. I had this for lunch today with a peas/carrot/corn organic veggie combo mixed in, and it was tasty and filling.<br /><br />Here's my opinion: The heat/hotness level (ie, the heat) is about mediumish. Maybe a bit to the mild side of medium. But it does have some heat, so know that. It's got good spicing, so it packs a flavor punch. There is a lovely creaminess, a thick creaminess, so you can water it down (as I do) to make soup or you can leave it thick to pour over rice or use naan to sop it up.<br /><br />My only critique is that the dumplings are not very dumplingey as I have previously experienced "dumplingness". They are, if I had to describe the texture/taste, like tiny baked potatoes. As if you cooked dumpling sized potatoes to a nice soft-firmness. But that's it. Like chunks of potato, not like dumplings (which I've had as airy and as chewy, depending).<br /><br />Since this is essentially just the potatoes and spiced milky-creamy base,  you can vary this in many ways by adding meats, veggies, thinning with milk or water, or topping with crispy bits (baked pita, croutons, etc) or bacon or cheese. Very versatile. This would totally rock with chicken pieces and peas, which is what I'll be making next with the Karhi. I will also try with spinach mixed in.<br /><br />For those watching their weight, this whole can is less than 300 calories worth of damage. :) And each serving has 70 calories (a can is four servings).<br /><br />This is the second Jyoti product offered on Amazon that I've tried. I think both are quite nice, and I will try their lentils with vegetables next. A high quality canned/convenience food for those who like Indian cuisine.

review/text: What can I say this is totally my own viewpoint but I LOVE this stuff. To me heating is optional. I have to buy this at a health food store 20 miles away from me but I make the trek every month and stock up. I usually by every can they have (like 6) I have a very hard time not eating the entire can in one sitting. Good gracious I love this Stuff! Oh and when they say spicy buttermilk sauce, it's really a highly spiced sauce not a hot sauce. one word: YUM!!!!!!!!! A note of caution though, I have a lactose intolerance and suffer minor stomach and digestive issues when I eat this. Probably because I ate the entire can. If you are moderately or severely lactose intolerant you may want to avoid this. Try the Dehli Saag instead. Also incredibly yummy! I'm glad to have found it on Amazon

review/summary: YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY
review/text: I got tired of waiting for my monthly trek to the healthfood store an hour away to buy this product, and searched here to see if I could buy it "on demand".  I was thrilled to see it offered, as well as all the other Jyoti products. It is my favorite canned product ever. I have produced a reasonable facsimile with potatoes, curry, and buttermilk, but cant get the incredible spice mixture of the original right. It may be the only dish I like better out of a can than what I can make fresh.<br /><br />as for the previous review regarding the "dumplingness" - the word dumpling has been used to mean so many different things, meat or filling wrapped in dough, a flour/water paste dropped by spoonfuls into boiling water, or a dessert made by wrapping fruit in pastry and baked. These dumplings are made by mixing cooked potatoes with flours, oil and spices, so while they do differ from more traditional dumplings, it is a nice descriptive term for them - much better than "little balls of spice potato mixture" - lol.<br /><br />as for restraint? I have none and now when I open the can I am going to eat the whole thing. I add just enough water to rinse the residual goodness out of the can and most often eat it as soup. If I only have one can and have to share it, I pour it over rice and add some sliced chicken and veggies.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Delicious ingredient in a CAN??
review/text: As an experienced cook, I can remember when using an ingredient out of a can signified that you were cut off from fresh ingredients and therefore were up a creek without a paddle.  Then I met Jyoti canned entrees, and my world turned upside down.  Jyoti makes Indian entrees out of the freshest possible ingredients and manages to put them into a can and preserve the freshness.  Moreover, the ingredients are perfectly seasoned, and can be used right out of the can.  Not that I do, but I could.  My usual method of cooking with Jyoti is to prepare a meat ingredient such as fresh ground lamb, seasoned with Kalyustan's Jordanian lamb spice, with yogurt as a binding ingredient, and finely chopped onion. I saute brown mustard seed, decorticated cardamom pods, turmeric, cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds, fennel seeds in a little oil, saute the meatballs until just brown, and then add the Jyoti spicy potato dumplings in buttermilk sauce until heated.  Serve on naan, for which I usually substitute whole wheat pita, sprayed with olive oil and heated. Jyoti ingredients are a wonderful discovery for the casual Indian cook.

review/text: Tastes just like coconut milk and curry powder with a few simple spices. One reviewer observed that the potatoes in this recipe closely resemble tator tots. She is absolutely right. It tastes pretty good if you like curried foods, but you can make it yourself very easily, cheaper and without having to order a case, and with real organic ingredients.<br />There is NOTHING on the package that says any of the ingredients are "Organic". I strongly dislike deceptive advertising and hope that this was not intentional.

review/text: I was a little taken aback when I first ate this. The potato dumplings have a texture suspiciously similar to tater-tots. Though surprising, this is not a downside - if anything it improved the overall awesomeness of this sauce concoction. I eat it on brown rice and its tangy salty creaminess reminds me of mac&cheese. It isn't exactly the healthiest thing you could eat, but it is really satisfying. I would recommend eating it on something else, however. It is a little overpowering (though not very spicy) on its own.

review/summary: Truly an Indian Delight!
review/text: If I had to choose one word to describe this Indian stew by Jyoti, it would be delightful! Admittedly, I'm a relative novice to this kind of Asian cooking, but I know what I like, and I really like this stuff! The delicious buttermilk sauce was thick and creamy, whilst the potato dumplings were just plain scrumptious. Be forewarned, however, that this dish is heavily spiced and salted! From what I gather, this is typical for Indian cuisine. The unique blend of spices is, all at once, wonderfully exotic and nearly overpowering. The curry flavor comes right-on through, whilst the other spices were a bit more subtle, yet completely unfamiliar. Adding some fresh vegetables, e.g., sugar snap peas, Vidalia onions, bell peppers, sugar beets, etc., would help to lessen the saltiness and tone-down the spiciness, as well. This stuff would be great over biscuits, rice, noodles [you name it], or as a base for a myriad of casseroles. If you're at all adventurous, then, for your own sake, jump off the deep end and order-up!

review/text: My 5 month old son loves this brand and flavor. I don't have to worry about whether the lid will reclose because my son can't get enough of this and wants more even after he finishes the jar; however, I haven't had any problems with the lid when I tried to close it. Earth's best makes great, natural products. Don't give a product a bad review because you can't figure out to rescrew a jar lid! The other reviewer complaining about the thickness/puree blend saying that EB is too watery doesn't know what he/she is talking about. Any pediatrician will explain and so does the EB website that "first" blends are very fine and highly strained so that your baby can get used to eating solids--that's also why you're supposed to mix a lot of breastmilk or formula with rice cereal when you first introduce it! When your baby is 6 months or older, you can move him onto the "2nd" foods which are thicker and have more varieties/combos. Hope this helps other parents!

review/text: I have started my baby on baby food and so far this is the only one she loves. She gobbles it up and pulls my hand towards her mouth when she sees it coming. She would eat the entire jar in one sitting if I would let her. She just loves it.

review/summary: Num nums!
review/text: Wanted my daughter to keep organic as much and long as possible so we tried this brand first & this veggie when she started solids.  It smelled good and from the first spoonfull (it's not so runny it won't stay on a spatula style spoon) she loved it!  This is her fave veggie so far.<br /><br />She'll eat a jar of this even after a full bottle if I let her!  No side effects noticed and I even tasted it & found it barely sweet and wholesome.<br /><br />This is a great deal and cheaper than in store; arrives bubblewrapped to death and no weird or broken jars so far.

review/summary: My twins loved this one
review/text: Sweet potato was the favorite of our now 10-month old twins. And it is absolutely loaded with vitamin A.<br /><br />I've asked many parents of babies around the same age as ours which foods their babies like. Each time they've said their babies like sweet potatoes, so I think this is a very good flavor choice.<br /><br />I've ordered and received many 12-jar packages of various varieties of Earth Best baby food. I stopped all my Earth Best subscriptions though. That's because I had three deliveries with broken jars within a short time. Amazon responded well. I wrote Earth's Best but they never responded.

review/summary: good product, infuriating container!
review/text: Only reason I'm giving this 3 stars vs. 4 is because of the lid - it doesn't close tightly! No matter how you slowly, carefully, methodically (and all while praying) loosen then tighten back the cap of the jar, it closes lopsided, potentially exposing the food to the air and, consequently, spoiling easily. And forget it if you're getting these for travel - you'll end up throwing away a half-eaten jar because you can't close the lid! Infuriating - yes, infuriating, not just maddening or disappointing, but infuriating! - and not at all Earth-friendly; why not sell these in recyclable containers with lids that twist off and on (or zip?) more easily than the glass and very flimsy tops that are now doubling as mini-frisbees for my baby?

review/summary: A BIG Hit
review/text: Our 3 dogs love Dingo bones.  But these peanut butter flavor bones are an obsession of our smallest rat terrier.  He's only 5 pounds, so bones tend to last several sittings for him.  Give him one of these and he's occupied for as long as it takes to finish.  He'll still play with other bones, but he loses his mind when he sees me go for this bag.  I just wish they were priced as well as the other Dingo products and less difficult to find.

review/text: My doberman went nuts over this bone.  He tried to devour it rather quickly.  My only complaint about this bone is that it left a mess on the floor; the red color of the bone rubs onto the floor.  It did wipe up fairly easily.  Just make sure when you give the bone to your dog he's not eating it on a carpeted floor.

review/summary: Dogs love this bone!
review/text: I have two 70 lb. dogs. One chews on anything but the other chews on almost nothing. Both will immediately attack this bone and have a ball chewing on it. The one dog usually ignores regular rawhide but I didn't have to wait and see with this, he took to it right away. The price fluctuates wildly with these kinds of bones, so watch for a sale. I paid about 3 bucks.

review/summary: WARNING: Open package received with signs of used product
review/text: Just wanted to warn any potential buyers that I received an open package buying from Amazon LLC.  I think that's pretty disgusting since this is a product that's intended for consumption by your pet.  Also, there were portions of the red "meat" that looked like it had been chewed on and the white bone portion was stained red all over.  Basically it looked as if a dog had chewed on it for a little and then repackaged up and sold on Amazon.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Too big for my dog
review/text: I have a labrador retriever. He weighs 82 lbs. He loved the bone, but I made the mistake and allowed him to eat the bone in one sitting. It was too much of a shock to his digestive system.  The next morning he developed diarrhea. I' m not sure if the bone is the reason the diarrhea lasted so long, but to be causious I will not buy the bones again.  To be fare about the product, I bought three of the bones and the last one was the one associated with my dog's problem, but of course that last bone is the only one he eat in one sitting.  I believe the product would be best for larger dog's than mine, or for smaller dog if the owner regulator the amount of the bone that is eaten at each sitting .

review/summary: Needs No Sweetener :)
review/text: I highly recommend Good Earth Sweet And Spicy Herbal Tea! This tea contains a successful blend of natural herbs that work together (think Chemistry and catalytic reaction!) to create a taste, flavor that seems 'Sweet'! This brewed tea is great hot and cold - we've made Sun Tea then refrigerated to enjoy the herbal delight over ice. When we've given this tea to others, they commented "Wow! What's in this tea?!" I bet this brewed tea would be a good ingredient in recipes (deserts or as a marinade) and as a compliment to any party/social beverage event (wedding punch, tea parties, holiday Wassail). The aroma that this tea produces fills the room with mental images of 'home' and Norman Rockwell paintings. I've tried other 'sweet and spicy' herbal teas but they lack the potency his particular brand has (you can get 2 or 3 cups of hot tea from just one teabag- getting your money's worth and then some). An added plus is this tea is caffeine-free so you can have a delicious cup of this spicy tea while you're snuggled up with a good book right before bedtime.

review/summary: FINALLY!
review/text: Got a Keurig for Christmas, and have spent the past two months trying to find great coffee that is also affordable.  Over a dollar each for the ones that I was getting at the grocery store was just not cutting it for me.  I purchased a reusable K-cup.  Couldn't stomach the weak coffee it made, and that was with superfine ground coffee.  Not to mention that it often only brewed half a cup.  So, after trying many different types, I decided I liked the taste of the Starbucks Sumatra the best, but it was way too expensive.  Come to find out, Green Mountain makes the Starbucks K-cups.  So I decided to try Green Mountain, as it is MUCH more affordable.<br />It's GREAT!  Nice, strong, flavorful cup of coffee!  FINALLY!

review/text: Got a Keurig for Christmas, so I've been having fun trying the wide variety of available K-Cup products.  So far, this is my favorite of all the coffees, and one of the few I'd stack up against a good cup of freshly ground and brewed regular coffee. Usually I like K-Cups because they're convenient.  I like these because they're truly excellent coffee and taste wonderful.  These and Coffee People's extra bold varieties are good enough to pass for the real thing - no one would ever suspect they were K-Cups if you didn't tell them.
