review/summary: Love Lavazza
review/text: I always buy Lavazza coffee. It has such a smooth taste and is a great value for the quality. I use Crema e Gusto with my Bialetti caffettiera and with my Breville espresso/cappuccino maker. I always get a lot of crema when I use this with my Breville machine. I've tried other brands but I always go back to Lavazza.

review/text: We're not really coffee experts, but have tried a few brands/roasts. This Lavazza Crema e Gusto has to be the best cup of coffee I've had. We've only used it in our drip maker so far, but will give it a try in our pump espresso maker soon. Yum, and highly recommended.

review/summary: Best espresso ever!
review/text: I used to buy only coffee that I could grind in the supermarket since I wanted the best possible espresso from my machine. However, I just moved to an urban area where I am unable to grind my own coffee conveniently (outside my home). So I searched on Amazon and found this coffee, which has excellent reviews. I figured it couldn't be better than freshly ground coffee, but that it was better than getting some old gross coffee from the convenience store across the street. Much to my and my boyfriend's surprise, this coffee makes much better espresso than any other coffee we have tried over the past few years (and we have tried many, including expensive coffee from Whole Foods). I don't know about the other blends from this brand, but if you like strong rich espresso, this one is AMAZING. Try it, and you'll see.

review/summary: Nice Stuff!
review/text: I bought this on a whim after some sporadic experience with an old, trusted roaster....  This is a very nice new taste for me.  It's a bit lighter roast than the two espresso roasts that I have been using.  It's got a nice, delicate taste that asks to be made on the strong side to show its best character.  I haven't bought ground coffee in many years, so this whole experience was a bit of a lark for me but I'm glad I tried it.  I'm using in a LaPavoni machine and a Moka rig and they're both working well with the grind as arrived.

review/text: This is a dark, chocolaty cofee. Grind works well in my stovetop espresso maker. I have tried many different espresso blends and was not sure how this would be since it is a blend of robusto and arabica beans but it is rich, dark, and as others have remarked, not at all acidic or bitter. My new favorite.

review/text: I was an avid fan of the Lavazza Cafe Espresso (black can) for years.  I was about to sign up for the subscription service for this product on Amazon.com when I started reading the reviews about the Lavazza Crema e Gusto. One of my main concerns is if the acid in a coffee will give me an upset stomach.  The Cafe Espresso didn't at all, so I was leery to switch to something else.  I figured I'd give the Crema e Gusto a try and if it was too much for my stomach, I'd switch back.  No worries.  Not only is this a smooth blend, it has a richer taste than the Cafe Espresso.  I won't need to switch back!

review/text: I have always loved the coffee in Italy and it's the only place where I consistently drink cappuccinos - no bitterness, bite or overwhelming strong flavor, just great coffee.  Until we decided to give this coffee I try, we were unable to duplicate that Italian espresso flavor.  Now we can!  We've given up all of our other gourmet espresso blends and drink only this in our lattes, cappuccinos, mochas and Americanos.  And everyone we've shared this coffee with has done the same!  Try it - I'll be surprised if you're disappointed!

review/text: I tied Lavazza at a coffee house in Milano and really enjoyed the taste. It doesn't have the bitterness that you find in almost all coffee houses in US. It is very full flavored coffee. I couldn't find it in US, not even at small European food stores. I searched online and Amazon has the best deal if you sign for regular delivery. You don't have to spend $300 to $400 for an espresso machine when you have an excellent quality coffee.

review/summary: fancy coffee shop taste and smell
review/text: one day recently, i purchased this crema e gusto lavazza when it was on sale, because i know my friend uses lavazza in his espresso-maker, and i thought i'd break out the moka maker again.  well.  holy cow.  i had forgotten what good coffee tasted like, based on my steady kcup habit.  i can barely taste my keurig kcups now, which seem fairly bland, or too sharp, or too...something else wrong in comparison. i'll still use my keurig due to the convenience, and perhaps i'll try using lavazza in my keurig as another review mentioned.  But, i think you cannot go wrong with a stove top moka of this stuff.  it is not bitter, it is not sour, it has no off notes-- just extremely rich and heady, a good hefty body and smoothness that can't be beat.  the outrageously excellent aroma permeates the house like a great coffee shop you might step into.<br /><br />i read some of the bad reviews, and i can't understand the negative comments, just as they can't understand the good reviews--taste is individual i guess!  But, i LOVE this coffee!  it's extremely good, and i will even drink it late in the evening despite the caffeine, due to the wonderful flavor. crazily, i find myself looking forward to a quiet weekend morning to indulge, just like you might see on some goofy ad where a woman with closed eyes is smiling in dreamy wonder while sniffing a cup. try this coffee- maybe you'll be lucky to be in the majority for whom this rings all the bells.<br /><br />update: i tried the Lavazza in the Keurig, and it just does not do it justice in comparison to the stove-top moka method. but, it still tastes better than regular k-cups.<br /><br />update 2: i tried this in the Aeropress (french drip type) machine that had over 1000 great reviews here on Amazon, and i have to say, this combo will be my only go-to coffee from now on.  the Aeropress, in addition to being easier to use than stove top, seems to make a less burnt flavored and more creamy brew.  this, combined with condensed sweetened milk (like the Vietnam-french drip type)is heavenly. i'm buying a second Aeropress to have this combo at home in addition to the office.

review/summary: wonderful coffee, the best, easy on the stomach
review/text: It is not have a bitter taste as a few have suggested.  I always use a melitta cup for making any espresso coffee and this one is just delicious.  I checked my ph strip and it does not register as acid.  It doesn't bother my stomach at all and I am super sensitive to anything acid.  American coffee I have a hard time tolerating; the Italian and Kenya coffees that are dark roast espresso are thought by some people via their processing techniques and quality to be alkaline.  It makes the American coffee look like junk for how the body responds and the taste. Once you have had this coffee you won't want American coffee anymore.<br /><br />In case anyone is wondering what a melitta cup is, it is a cone made from plastic or ceramic (mine is ceramic) and it has a hole at the bottom.  I adjust the coffee filter to fit it and then put the espress coffee in it and then pour my hot water from the tea kettle into it.  I add a little nut milk into the coffee and I am ready to enjoy a wonderful taste.  It beats dealing with a coffee maker any day.  Each person in the family can have their own melitta cup as it is so quick to do.

review/summary: too coarse for espresso
review/text: This coffee is ground too coarsely to make decent espresso in either of my two Capresso machines.  I filled the portafilter to the top and tamped as hard as I could, but when I brew the water runs through the filter way too fast.  I get about 3 oz. of coffee in 10 seconds instead the ideal 1 oz. in 25 seconds.  This results in strong coffee instead of actual espresso.  I've tried to make this as regular coffee in a french press as well, but the 70% robusto bean in the blend makes for a pretty bland cup of coffee.

review/summary: Burnt taste nothing like Lavazza
review/text: I bought this from Amazon since they don't have this kind of coffee locally. I had purchased the identical brand and boldness about a year ago.  Wow, this stuff doesn't even taste like what I had originally! It has an awful burnt taste that lingers as an aftertaste. It really doesn't even compare to what I had before. They must have changed the beans or reduced the quality because it is not smooth at all and has a bitterness and aftertaste that reminds me of the lingering taste after smoking a cigarette. I've decided to switch brands completely. No returns it so I'm stuck with 3 1/2 bricks of sub-par coffee grounds.

review/text: deployed in the military doesn't always mean you need to miss out on the finer things in life. Another co-worker and myself enjoy our coffee everyday and talking about the brewing smells that come with it. I was able to snag this for 3 bucks a brick. This is some smooth and great tasting coffee. The taste going down your throat is amazing and when we open a new vacuum sealed bag we both take a big whiff of that great ground coffee smell. It makes a pretty strong cup of joe(caffeine too) and not for that bad of a price. Our bags don't expire until the end of 2012 but we don't have to worry about that since we are on our third bag already... this won't replace our regular brands but is a good change. thanks to amazon for shipping this to us.

review/summary: excellent taste, decaf please
review/text: My absolute favorite. So smooth and not bitter at all.  With cream and sugar it tastes like premium coffee ice cream.  I use it in my small drip coffee maker, because I'm usually too busy to make with the espresso maker.  It tastes the same either way, just with less water.<br /><br />My only issue with it is that after drinking it every day for six months I developed heart palpitations. I previously was not a daily coffee drinker, so that probably has something to do with it, but I am only in my early thirties. They don't make a decaf version, and I have yet to find one that tastes as smooth.  So now it's only for special occasions, never days in a row.<br /><br />So if you are sure your heart is VERY healthy (I thought mine was before I had issues), go for it.  But tread lightly, and be sure to keep well hydrated.

review/text: One taste was all it took for me. I tried Lavazza at a local coffee house in Denver and really enjoyed the taste. No bitterness at all. Very full flavored coffee.<br /><br />I came across this as the word "Crema" caught my eye. Now I am ordering it using the subscribe and save. It is running me $17.41 for every order and that's with free 2 day shipping because of the Prime Membership.<br /><br />Each brick lasts about 10 days for 2 people drinking 6 cups of coffee every morning. I use 1 tablespoon coffee for every 6 ounces of water brewed in a Target Michael Graves design automatic drip coffeemaker. The "Flavor" button really brings it out in this coffee. I love my coffee with half and half and it really seems to compliment it well.<br /><br />The packages are vacuumed sealed and take up very little space. It really is a 5 star coffee.

review/summary: Rich and flavorful - even from the "wrong" pot!
review/text: I found a brick of Lavazza Crema e Gusto at a local shop some months ago, and tried it in my stovetop espresso maker. For some reason I thought the grind was what I needed (it *does* have a picture of a stovetop machine on it!) but the grind is really very fine, more like what a professional-type machine needs.<br /><br />But this works even in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001DJT7G">Bialetti Brikka 4-Cup Stovetop Percolator</a> stovetop machine, and generates a beautiful crema. The Brikka really wants a slightly coarser grind, so I have to be *very* careful to put in the coffee with a light touch, and not to pack it down even a tiny bit.<br /><br />The flavor, as others have written, is very rich without being too dark-roasted, with lovely chocolatey notes. Bitterness can come if I overfill the maker so that the coffee is packed too hard, which causes boiling and burning. So care must be taken when using a stovetop maker. But it's truly worth it, because it gives such delicious coffee.

review/summary: Not the greatest, but not the worst either.
review/text: I drink espresso (moka) daily, and go through a 250g/8.8oz brick in about 2 weeks. In my opinion, this isn't the greatest blend from Lavazza that I've had, but it's not the worst coffee I've had either (it definitely beats the drip coffee I'd otherwise get at work). It's a 70/30 robusta/arabica blend, a dark roast with a fruity though noticeably bitter finish (but not as bad as Starbucks or Peet's coffee). The Lavazza Espresso (black tin, 100% arabica claimed) tastes better than this blend, but after having tried Illy's moka grind, the different blends from Lavazza, Kimbo, Segafredo, and also blends from the local coffee roasters, I actually think that a robusta/arabica blend works best for a moka pot; just not this one. Overall, I'd say that I got what I paid for, but I didn't get what I wanted and I was seduced by the 93 or so 4/5 star reviews for this coffee. I'd really give it a 2.5 or 3 but then again, all taste is subjective, That being said, this is a reasonable coffee (considering taste vs. price), but I'll probably switch back to my regular (and unfortunately more expensive) blend.

review/summary: Good, Mild Flavor, High Caffeine Coffee
review/text: I consider myself a reasonable coffee enthusiast having done tours of places like Intelligentsia and know a decent bit about how to make the right brew.<br /><br />That said, Lavazza Crema e Gusto is an interesting 30% Arabica, 70% Robusto blend.  It's well known that Robusto beans have less flavor than Arabica and are cheaper, but tend to higher in caffeine content.  That said, that is pretty much what you get with this blend.  It's in all technical aspects a lower quality product, Robusto is considered a low end bean that you will almost never find it in American consumer coffee.  Even instant coffee tends to tout 100% Arabica as well-informed consumers prefer the full flavor.<br /><br />What's interesting is that Lavazza has decided to mix it, and so there's that coffee flavor coming from the Arabica, but it's mild due to how it's diluted.  The "creaminess" I would say comes in part from the very fine grind they use, hence it comes packaged in these vacuum-packed bricks that are more like a mold when you open the bag than the usual medium grind you'll see.  As a result, whether you drip or french press it, you get some of that bean filtrate coming through and it gives it a more creamy texture which is in all actuality the bean particulate coming through.<br /><br />Finally the caffeine kick is awesome, as it's probably 2x stronger than your average coffee thanks to the Robusto beans and the super fine grind, making it a solid wake up coffee.  I personally don't like the taste of it straight as compared to other 100% Arabica coffees like Sumatra or Columbian (which are my preferences) as it's just it's just too bland for my tastes but a touch of milk and sugar brings out more mellow flavors and again that subtle texture.  Good for mornings, but I wouldn't necessarily ever have it as my go to coffee my evening cup.

Robusta is mixed in cheap blends because it is cheap. Tastes awful too... ). Also, the price of this coffe does not reflect the low quality - it should be way cheaper.<br />I normally buy Lavazza Oro, but somehow the quality of that coffee deteriorated in the last year or so).

review/text: I've tried several brands and flavors of ground coffee from Amazon, and this is by far the.best.coffee.I've.had. I decided to write a review because last weekend my husband made me a latte, and it was yummy. I asked for a second one, and what he gave me was not what I had the first time. I asked him what was different, and he told me he used a different brand and flavor. He was really surprised that I could tell. The one that I LOVED was the Lavazza Crema e Gusto. Wow. What a difference. It's smooth and full bodied - okay, I'm full of crap. I have no idea what "full bodied" is other than a fat chick. But I can tell you this -- this coffee is tasty and you will not regret buying it.<br /><br />I bought it in January because there was a deal going on - $12 for 4 bricks. But here I am willing to pay $15 for 4 bricks (S&S price) less than 2 months later. I wish I had stocked up when it was cheaper, but who knew the coffee was going to be THAT GOOD! It's so worth even $18 for 4 bricks!

review/text: What type of coffee drinker am I?<br />In our Cuisinart coffee maker my wife and I use 1.5 tablespoons of Dunkin Donuts coffee per 6 oz of water so we like our coffee pretty strong. However, neither one of us goes out of our way to get Starbucks because we don't like the taste for some reason. If Starbucks is considered bitter, that is probably why.<br /><br />Review.<br />I would consider this coffee bold yet not bitter. It's definitely full flavored yet not over powering. Maybe that is what "Crema e Gusto" is specifying. The ratio of coffee to water for a Dunkin Donuts drinker is about 3/4 of a table spoon to 6oz of water. I accredit the smaller ratio to how finely ground the coffee is rather than overall strength.<br /><br />I drink iced coffee in the summer so even though it is January I had to try it. This coffee is IDEAL for making iced coffee because you can make it at 1.5 table spoons to 6oz of water and the taste is not effected by a little bit of ice melting. I can not stress enough how good this coffee is iced!<br /><br />I am defiantly enjoying the LavAzza and may try other varieties to make hot coffee but this is my go to for iced coffee from now on!

review/summary: tasty in the keurig
review/text: well after 2 months of trying new k-cup flavors, i got tired of the expense and waste. i bought a reusable k-cup from amazon (ecobrew) and am in the process of finding the perfect bean. THIS IS IT!!! i fill my cup halfway and brew it on the 8oz setting. not only is it a perfect cup of rich flavorful coffee, the bag has lasted soooo long! i bought when it was 12 bucks for 4 bags (subscribe and save) and i think this will last at least 2 months drinking 2-3 cups a day. absolutely no waste! i love my keurig and lavazza!!!<br /><br />i also have a wonderful espresso machine that i use this in, however the keurig is my new coffee toy to play with. either way the lavazza tastes great.<br /><br />note: it brews a lot slower due to the fine ground BUT this is the way to extract all the flavor. it is brews way too slow use less in the k-cup filter.

review/summary: illy fan is loving this blend in our home machine
review/text: As my wife and I found we had become "those people" who stop at the local coffee shop many times a week, we needed to hit the lotto, quit or buy a machine and learn to make our own go-juice.<br /><br />This coffee brews wonderfully in our new DeLonghi Bar32 (EC155 clone) - the fine grind makes the cheezy built-in tamper more than good enough, reducing counter-clutter. And the crema produced is a dream - though the fancy, much older, espresso machine at work can't hope to achieve this with me driving it --- the DeLonghi is just newbie-proof and brews this blend really really nicely.<br /><br />Though she was initially disappointed I didn't splurge on the illy to christen the new machine, she likes the lattes we're making at home more than her $3 coffee shop favorite. This blend is fine for my mocha, too, though if she didn't LOVE this coffee I'd give the Rossa a whirl looking for just a little stronger flavor to stand up with the cocca powder. Frankly - this is making as good a mocha as what I buy at any of my 3 shops, so I'm happy too!<br /><br />Glad I trusted the reviews. I just signed up for a "subscription" - can't beat the price!

review/summary: LAVAZZA CREME E GUSTO V LAVAZZA ROSSA
review/text: I decided to try the Lavazza blue pack (Crema e Gusto) instead of the one that I had found to be perfect in Europe, the Red pack or Lavazza Rossa. I like it but not as much as the Rossa. For my taste it is a little too mocha flavored and I prefer the more robust cafe espresso flavor of the red pack. The price for either coffee is very competetive, particularly if you take advantage of the subscription ordering option. I will be switching back to the Lavazza Rossa.

review/text: This is a great espresso, and amazon has the BEST price out there!  I can't drink hot coffee in the summer, so I have started brewing this the night before.  I make about 4 double shots, but brew it more like an americano - into a small pyrex cup.  Then I allow it to cool, pour it into a container with a little ice, and the next morning, voila - Iced Americano as soon as I wake up without having to mess with the espresso machine.  I have tried other brands, Illy, Fresh and Easy, but this is my favorite and the price is right.

review/summary: This is the coffee I have been looking for
review/text: First had Lavazza at a local coffee shop and was floored. To me, this is what coffee should taste like. It is bold and strong, but no bitterness whatsoever. I recently bought a Curtis commercial coffee maker and was hoping for the same experience from my office and home. After a few different coffees (mostly local whole bean), I was disappointed that my coffee wasn't turning out as good as the cafe I went to. To my surprise, the next time I visited the local grocery store, I saw this Lavazza brand in the Italian isle. I immediately bought it and brewed it that night. After the first sip, I knew I had hit the jackpot. This is what I have been waiting for. All along it had been the coffee making the difference. The Curtis helps significantly with ensuring the proper temperature of the brew, but it is really the coffee that makes all the difference. I am impressed in the packaging and was surprised how packed they are able to get the ground coffee.<br /><br />BTW - I have only used this for my drip coffee maker - have not used it for espresso yet. For my taste, one coffee scoop (1/8 cup / or 2 tablespoons) for every 16 oz of water.<br /><br />As long as Amazon or my local grocer carries this coffee, I will be buying it. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars. .

review/summary: Very nice coffee blend
review/text: I started drinking coffee only about a month or so ago, but I was interested in trying some finer coffees.  This blend was very nice, with a nice rich coffee flavor without all the bitterness you would find with cheaper coffee.  I have not tried this with espresso, as I do not own an espresso machine.  With a drip machine, you will still experience the wonderfully bold flavor of this coffee.  I have had a few of my friends that love coffee try this blend and they were just as impressed as I was.  This is a must have in my house!

review/summary: Undeniably delicious!
review/text: I recently purchased a Bialetti stovetop espresso maker, and read that Lavazza was a well-suited brand for use in this maker. After a few trials in getting the right coffee:water ratio, I can say that this blend of coffee is smooth, aromatic, and definitely delicious. I am a strong coffee drinker, and this dark roast coffee is a blend of Robutso and Arabica beans which makes the flavor much stronger and rich. It's definitely a full-bodied roast with great chocolate notes. Buy this coffee, and you will truly enjoy it, use it with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNY6UK">Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker</a> and you will not be disappointed!

This coffee is smooth (i.e. not acidic) but it packs a big flavor. If you're looking for a coffee that packs a good punch, this is the one. If you want more subtlety, I would go for the for the Lavassa Caffe Espresso.

review/text: This is an amazing coffee.  Intense flavor, but not bitter.<br /><br />I use it in my Bialetti Moka espresso maker and the results are no less than phenomenal.  I prefer it served in shot form, as is.  But I've also tried it with a little sugar in the shot (very tasty), with a little frothed almond milk to create a cappuccino (good), and my husband has had it with frothed milk, and a little sugar to create a latte (he enjoys it immensely).<br /><br />I have always had an affinity for strong coffee, so this works out wonderfully for me.  Rich, intense flavor without the associated bitterness most coffee's have.<br /><br />I recommend you try it!

review/summary: Excellent for pre-ground coffee!
review/text: First of, there is nothing better than a cup of coffee made with fresh beans, being ground right before making the cup of coffee.  That being said, the Lavazza Crema e Gusto coffee is actually kind of great.  I bought it based on the number of great reviews on Amazon.  Opening the package I immediately noticed the back of the bag of coffee - it says 70% robusta beans and 30% arabica beans.  I was immediately nervous that this coffee would be horribly bitter, but after making a double "shot" Americano from my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK">Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a> my fears disappeared. It is a very smooth, almost chocolatey coffee.  This coffee will be perfect to keep at my office where it's near impossible to get a good cup of coffee.

review/summary: Great in the Bialetti Moka Pot
review/text: This is nice, full-bodied espresso, which I brew in my moka pot.  It doesn't do much to get crema in a moka pot, but then not much will with this method... but with the Robusta in this blend, you should experience crema a bit more easily in a machine. With my stove-top milk frother, a little steamed milk brings out the chocolaty notes described by Lavazza, and it's a nice morning treat.<br /><br />This amount (4 bricks, 8.8oz each) has lasted me a good 3 months of summertime use in a 6c moka pot.  I'll probably go to every 2 months on my subscription for autumn through spring.

review/summary: New Espresso Drinker
review/text: I purchased this brand of coffee when I purchased Bialetti Moka Express L'Original 12 Cup Espresso Maker. Up until now, I've had no experience with either. Normally, I'm the type of person to find one brand of coffee and stick with it. When the price of my current brand of coffee shot up, I started looking around for something else.<br /><br />What caught my eye was the Arabica/Indian/Robusta blend. It sounded so exotic. Plus, the chocolaty flavor in the description. I've never been one for dark coffee, but if it had a chocolaty undertone, I was in. Besides, the onetime cost of $20.13 for a pack of four (as of 07/23/2011) was reasonable.<br /><br />My cup of coffee is mixed with equal parts of cream, but my husband only uses a little. Both of us agree this is a smooth cup of coffee with no bitter taste. We love it so much that I've signed up for the subscribe and save plan. Now it's only $17.11 for a pack of four. Again, this is as of 07/23/2011.

review/summary: Mmmm, Lavazza
review/text: I first tasted and loved Lavazza espresso during time in Italy, where it's popularly consumed. The rich aroma and full flavor are a delight, and I don't find it overly acidic (it's certainly MUCH easier on my stomach than American-style drip coffee, and this from someone with strong stomach and a love of all kinds of drip coffees). I haven't tasted the various Lavazza roasts extensively, but I typically buy and adore Crema e Gusto--in fact, I brew it *every* single morning I'm at home and drink it latte-style, at about a 2:1 warmed-milk to hot-espresso ratio.<br /><br />I heartily recommend buying an authentic Italian stovetop coffeemaker to brew this espresso. I have and love the Bialetti six-cup caffettiere (Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker, found here on Amazon). It's what the typical Italian family uses every morning and throughout the day.<br /><br />The Lavazza vacuum packs are sturdy and small little bricks that store easily, and every time I snip open a new container the distinctive, warm aroma rush fills my kitchen. Mmmm, Lavazza.

review/summary: deeply satisfying
review/text: I needed to find a grind and roast that would fit my need for the taste I was used to with my home espresso machine, a high end Illy that broke and left me after 10 years of service! I went low tech and bought a Bialetti stainless steel 4 cup model with a valve system that creates foam and great crema. The Lavazza crema e gusto ground coffee works perfectly in this pot, only takes a few minutes to brew and the taste is wonderful, full bodied, rich and with no bitterness. For me, it lingers with a bit of smokiness and overtone of dark chocolate. Sometimes I place a very thin 99% cocoa square on the back of my tongue if I'm drinking this coffee later in the day and have a craving for something. It can distract me from many other more caloric choices!

review/text: Yes i did say drip. I have now tried 2 different lavazza brands. This is the better of the two but do not discount the other as i love it equally. I will continue to buy both as i love the occasional change up. If you use this in a drip coffee pot i would suggest staring out with using just over half of the normal amount you usually use then move on from there. With other brands including starbucks i would use 1 - 1.5 scoops per cup. So in my 5 cup maker depending on what taste i was going after i would use up to 8 scoops. With both lavazza coffees i have found 3-3.5 scoops is ideal in my 5 cup maker. It takes a few times to get it in your head that so much less coffee works but it does.

review/text: I bought this after reading all the great reviews. It's a bit better than Folgers in my taste. Something bitter in the flavor. Kind of disappointed really.

review/summary: Don't be fooled by "Lavazza" name
review/text: I used it with dual boiler Bezzera and also with Moka pot. Neither taste nor crema was good. This is like paying BMW money and getting most basic VW.

review/summary: Trust the reviews!
review/text: I read the reviews and went for it.  Having little experience with the brand, I was nervous about trying it. But, I really wanted a better espresso that my husband and I had available.  Starbucks was acceptable, but not great and grocery store brands were laughable.<br /><br />I am so glad I trusted the reviews!! Six months later, we don't drink anything else now and have no desire to pay someone else to make a sub-par cup o' joe. The flavor of Lavazza is strong, full, and without bitterness.<br /><br />If you're on the fence - go for it.  It was totally worth the chance we took.

review/summary: No prob with french press, very tasty!!
review/text: I bought it after the great reviews. Instead of buying the bialetti for the stovetop, I used my bodum french press despite of it being too fine ground. 2 Cups of hot microwaved water (getto style haha) with 1.5 scoop of coffee is perfect for me. Despite of it being very bold with the crema on top, I'm surprised that it doesn't taste bitter and sour at all! I added a bit of french vanilla, VERY TASTY! Get the individual brick if you're still not sure (sold by LaPrima Shops for $7.49)<br /><br />Try it, you'll love it!

review/summary: Very Nice And Good
review/text: I'm no coffee aficionado but I know what doesn't suck, and this coffee doesn't. It works well in my stovetop espresso maker as well as in the ol' Bunn. When I use it in my French press it's pretty dreggy but I like it like that. Alls I can say is this coffee is bold and flavorful and has pretty much become my everday coffee.

review/summary: perfect
review/text: I am from Italy and I came to the US a couple of weeks ago (I will stay here for  a year). I am really sorry but I have to say that for my taste american coffee is a kind of "watered down" soft drink. Thus, I brought my espresso machine with me and I am so happy that Amazon is selling this italian coffee. I really love it and I will definitely order this product again: it is italian coffee, good price and extremely fast shipping. What more could you ask for?
