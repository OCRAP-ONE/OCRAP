review/summary: "Best if served chilled"
review/text: When I first got my order of tea in, I didn't read the label and started drinking immediately, a horrible mistake, it tasted of spinach. However when I did read the label, specifically the "Best if served chilled" part, I put all of the bottles in my fridge. When chilled they taste really good, though I found that shaking them before drinking made it taste better in my opinion.

review/summary: Delicious, if a bit foolish
review/text: You won't get a better plain cold green tea than this. Refreshing anytime. Also comes in a good strong bottle (which you can even reuse).<br /><br />That said, you can *make your own* green tea for pennies, at almost zero environmental impact, and refill any water bottle with it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002CRZRW">Yamamotoyama - Tokusen Kokyu Sencha (Premium Green Tea) 3.5 Oz.</a><br /><br />So ordering a dozen filled bottles to be shipped to you from far away is, in comparison, costly and wasteful.

review/summary: Great Bottled Tea
review/text: I first found this at my local Whole Foods and decided to give it a try after trying some of Ito En's other products.  I loved it.  Oi Ocha actually was what started me drinking green tea on a regular basis and has opened me up to various others since then.  It has a very natural flavor nothing like some of the "green teas" in bottles i have tried that don't have even the slightest tea flavor or color for that matter.  It is slightly stronger and slightly less grassy than self brewed teas (sencha in this case), albeit that may just be the way i brew them.  But it is very convenient, the flavor is great, I highly recommend it for anyone who like a nice cold green tea and doesn't feel like brewing it themselves.

review/text: This is by far the best UNSWEETENED green tea I have ever tasted.<br />I have tried and tasted alot of teas, and it's hard to find a good unsweetened GREEN tea.<br />Many of the green teas in the supermarket have some sugar in them.<br />Some teas are so watered down that the tea favor is minimal.<br />This tea has a much stronger tea taste than the watered down teas.<br />Just like coffee, you have to acquire a taste for tea.  If you like tea, you'll love this tea.

review/summary: A Tasty Alternative to Sugar Drinks
review/text: I bought this product to try to curb coffee drinking, and as means as a more healthy alternative.  I work shift work, so I basically survive on caffeine.  The beverage has a very subtle flavor.  It is definitely one of the better tasting green teas on the market.  The beverage has to be drank cold, otherwise it loses a lot of its flavor.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good green tea with a healthy alternative to other drinks, then I would recommend this product.  It is a little on the pricey side compared to other beverages, but worth the taste.  Be aware that it contains a decent amount sodium (comparable to a diet coke.

review/summary: Yummy Yummy in my tummy!
review/text: After drinking this, I always experience a euphoric feeling. Not sure why - but Green tea for me has always had an instantaneous pick me up result. I love this and have it on the Amazon Subscribe & Save where it automatically ships me the next delivery per my requested timeframe. The taste is crisp and great. I agree w/other reviews regarding having this cold vs. room temperature - the colder the better. Also, I noticed on my second shipment, the bottles have changed - same great taste but the bottles are now a different type of plastic, I think maybe a more recycled plastic? I kind of liked the original bottles, but honestly, it makes no difference. Best part of this tea? It is sugar free!! And I have many times opened a bottle and not been able to finish it and put it back in the fridge and have it a day or two or even three later and it still tastes great - I did not see a decline in taste or color as others mentioned.

review/summary: A Very Quality Beverage.
review/text: I enjoy a variety of beverages with my meals, and just for refreshment. I've tried any number of bottled teas and I like some of them. Personally, I've always thought that most were either too sweet (whether with honey, sugar or artificially flavored). I was mentioning this to my wife the other day and she came up with a packet of Ito En (Oi Ocha) Japanese Green Tea and suggested I try it. She said it came from Costco, but it's probably available elsewhere or here on Amazon. Well, I took a bottle (16.9 ounces) pored over ice and a later bottle chilled ice cold in the fridge. Excellent. Much better than other brands. Very smooth and light tasting with a ever-so slightly bitter aftertaste. Quite refreshing! Goes well with food. I particularly like the absence of any sweetness of any kind. Plus it has the antioxident qualities of green tea and a surprisingly high vitamin C content. It's a very quality beverage.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Finally!  Real Green Tea in a bottle!
review/text: I love green tea but it's impossible to find the real stuff, ready-to-drink, without sugar.  I won't eat or drink anything with any type of sugar substitute.  I don't care how "natural" it claims to be.  So when a label reads "Sugar Free," it really means "Fake Sugar."  Ugh! So I was VERY happy to find this product, I think I'll have it shipped to me regularly.  It doesn't taste like any "Green Tea" you'd find bottled in the grocery store, it's the real deal.  Wonderful with a splash of cranberry juice over ice!  All the benefits of Green Tea without the sugar and fillers, three ingredients - "Purified Water, Green Tea, Ascorbic Acid."  Yay!

review/text: To make this simple the tea is perfect!  It's the same refreshing taste I'm used to during my stays in Japan.<br />My previous delivery arrived in near impeccable condition with only one bottle slightly dented.  I have never had problems with products shipped directly from amazon, with the exception of the one I have just received.<br /><br />The wrapping on the bottles was very dirty and deteriorated.  Most bottles remained intact but a couple were dented badly and on the verge of bursting.  The cardboard packaging has obviously been exposed to a lot of moisture and other elements.  I'm not sure what happened.<br /><br />Unfortunately Amazon wont allow these items to be replaced.  I gave it 4 stars because of the tea and at least they are still drinkable.  I might consider canceling my subscription if they arrive like this again.<br /><br />Great product and true to the Japanese original. Just may not arrive 'AS' great.

After the case was finished, I cleaned out the bottles and brewed up a bunch of Tazo iced tea, added honey, and put into the bottles, and he noticed the difference, couldn't even drink it. So I won't be doing that again! I will order this Ito En product again.

I would buy these again, they arrived in good shape (no leaks) and fit nicely in the door of the fridge. You def want to drink them really cold for best taste.

review/summary: Ito En Oi Ocha (whatever that means)
review/text: I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to foreign food & drink. I'm trying to change that. After years of reading the health benefits of green teas, I have been trying all kinds. I have to say, for my Americanized palette, this stuff tastes the worst of all the green teas I have tried. I have no doubt that the other reviewers who have experienced this type of Japanese tea really do think it is good. I however, choked down this stuff because the thought of wasting $20 perplexes me. What I can confirm is this IS from Japan. Amazon must have listened to you guys complaining about the Chinese tea because I received the actual stuff. I would buy this again if I had guests that liked it, or for my college daughter to try it, but not because I liked the taste. If I was positive this was the best, most radical health boosting tea, yeah, I'd buy it. A word of advice to those who disliked the taste, I found no difference in the yuckness factor either warm or cold. It is indeed distasteful even chilled. So, I drank it warm. Beverages are easy to guzzle down if they are room temp.  Don't worry, this is not the worst tea I have tried. This stuff is... <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIL5ZS">Harney & Sons Fine Teas Japanese Sencha - 20 Tea bags</a>  I sure hop this honest review has helped out SOMEONE. :-)

review/text: I took advantage of a promotion on a 12 pack of these after seeing all the good reviews. I am used to using green tea that comes in the tea bags and drink several cups per day so I was excited to see if I would like these. I just opened one and drank a little bit and the first thought that came to mind is rancid. I don't know whether I got a bad batch or not but it tastes nothing like I thought it would. I thought I would get a light tasting traditional green tea but instead took in a mouthful of funky tasting fermented-like liquid. It even smells bad. I somehow will have to stomach power my way through 11 more of these. I don't know if I have the stomach for it....

I have uploaded the picture to compare this product with the original Oi Ocha. Though I don't have Koi Ocha with me at the moment to verify that this is in fact the repackaged Koi Ocha.<br /><br />Koi Ocha (this product) is not a bad product, but it's not the normal green tea that is "Japan's #1 Green Tea" as claimed on package of this product. It has taste that seem to be cross between oolong tea and green tea. It's less mild and more bitter than the original Oi Ocha, and it has less depth with cheap taste.<br /><br />I'm very dissapointed with how Ito-en is misrepresenting their own product and won't be buying these again.

review/summary: The best packaged spanish rice I've ever found
review/text: This is the best packaged spanish rice I've ever been able to find, and I'm guessing I've tried at least 8 or 10 different commercial brands. I find this is virtually identical to the rice at "real" Mexican restaurants (except for the tomato bits which naturally aren't as fresh). And it is so easy to make as well. My 7 year old inhales this stuff. I recommend it highly.

review/text: ...if you buy lupinis in salty brine you're supposed to rinse them in fresh water before you start munching. That's probably what the italian restaurant had done too. (The huge amount of salt is there to keep the beans fresh.)<br /><br />Hope you didn't throw the lupinis away!

review/summary: Like Fruit Lifesavers
review/text: These gummies were soft, chewy and almost bursting with flavor which reminded me very much of the original Fruit Lifesavers, but with a juicy, slightly tart tang.  I'm not overly fond of Lifesavers, so these gummies aren't really to my liking, but folks who enjoy Fruit Lifesavers will LOVE these!  I gave these 5 stars because I know my taste doesn't follow the main stream and I'm not going to bad mouth a good product just because it isn't to my taste.<br /><br />The shapes of these gummies were definitely interesting, too.  One reminded me of a werewolf or sasquatch type critter, there were dinosaurs, lizards, something that looked like a pacifier, coke bottles...definitely fun shapes to put a few in a child's snack pack without going completely overboard on the sugar.

review/text: I love roasted chestnuts and I sometimes find myself looking for those in vain when they are not in season.  This product is an excellent idea to have the roasted chestnuts for a very reasonable price. They are delicious and very convenient as they come already roasted and almost peeled. Although they are in the shell, the shells are cut in half and most of the time the chestnuts come out pretty easily by simply widening the cut. I am definitely purchasing more when I get through these. Love them!

I was surprised by that at first, but I found that it doesn't detract from the taste but instead makes sure you don't end up with a dry mouth after eating them. The pouch is moist and that is what makes the Chestnuts moist, if the Chestnuts remain outside of the pouch they are no longer moist.<br />Recommended.

review/summary: Galil with shell vs Galil without
review/text: Some time ago I purchased the 24 packs of Galil chestnuts "without" the shell.  They were very good. The next time I decided to get the ones "with" the shell on. These were very good also, even better in my opinion. I do buy and roast my own fresh chestnuts occasionally so I know what they are like fresh. Here is what I found with Galil foil sealed chestnut types.  The shelled ones taste good, a tiny bit sweeter then the ones with the shell (not much thou). The shelled ones were smaller in size then the ones with shell after shelling (about 30% smaller). Again not a problem. The shelled ones were a bit moister (my one daughter preferred the moistness,not me). Fresh roasted are never that moist. Again this may not be a problem for you. Now, the ones with the shell on in my opinion are better as they taste closer to real roasted fresh chestnuts. The shell ones have the more dry in the mouth texture like fresh (but not exactly). All in all I like the ones with the shell better (closer to the fresh roasted). OH YA the shells come off pretty easy on most, a few are harder but well worth the extra work. Also the shell is very light, and I believe you get more for your money with the ones with shell on. I love these.

review/summary: High expectations, then it comes eating it...
review/text: A few weeks ago I bought two boxes of packaged chestnut product from Costco (don't remember the brand). That was the first time I bought pre-packaged chestnut. It was peeled, perfectly cooked, and delicious!! Unfortunately they were no longer in stock when I went back and tried to purchased it again. So I went online and found this product on amazon.<br /><br />I signed up for subscribe-and-save, and I figured I would have a long term relationship with this product. Shipping was prompt and the package arrived in good condition. I tore open a bag and was eager to give myself a treat. Then I saw them, the dark (nearly black), soggy, soft chestnuts half-naked hidden inside the mushy shells. I was thinking to myself, hmm, this doesn't look like something delicious. Reluctantly I peeled one chestnut and put it into my mouth. It was stale, soggy, and a little bit sweet, far from what I had expected. I decided to give it a second chance and put the second one in my mouth. It was even worse. It was rotten and had a terrible bitter taste. I quickly spit it out and realized I made a big mistake.<br /><br />I was going to give this product only one star. But realizing I had a very high expectation which may affect my objectivity, I'm giving it two stars in the spirit of being fair. In any case, I do NOT recommend this product. There're far better products out there, like the one sold in Costco.

I decided to order the Galil chestnuts from Amazon thinking they would be like the ones I had found before.  These were a huge disappointment.  They aren't in the least bit like freshly roasted chestnuts.  They are mushy.  It's as if they had been boiled for hours.  I am now sceptical about ordering another brand of packaged roasted and peeled chestnuts for fear they will be the same.

review/summary: ginger aid for babies with colic
review/text: I had tried every remedy for my daughter's colic to no avail.  It is so distressing not to be able to soothe you child when they are obviously hurting.  My last attempt was to add tea to her formula.  I steeped the tea as instructed and added 1/2 ounce of Ginger Aid to every 6 ounces of formula (discolored formula a little).  The results were amazing!  She has gone from screaming for hours and having a look for misery on her face at most times to one of peace!  She eats better, sleeps better and is more alert during her awake hours.  The look she had on her face of discomfort all the time is now replaced with a look of relaxation. The screaming is now just bedtime fussiness.  Thank you Traditional Medicinals for this organic product!

review/summary: If You Have Acid Reflux, You Must Drink This Tea!
review/text: About a year ago, I was diagnosed with acid reflux and a superficial ulcer.  While my doctor was great at discovering my problem, besides prescribing the standards prescription medication, she offered no other salient advice.  After doing a bit of research, I decided that I had to stop drinking coffee and black tea and find a beverage that contained ginger.<br /><br />I discovered this tea at my local supermarket.  After drinking it for about a week, I noticed that my digestive system improved dramatically; there was a marked decrease in the burning sensation in my chest and stomach, and no more regurgitation of acid in my throat. As the months went by my problem improved about 90%, which I attribute to modest adjustments to my diet and drinking this tea 3-4 timed a day.  I usually include about a half a teaspoon of sugar and a drop of milk, although I also enjoy it straight up.  It has a pleasant flavor with a bit of a lemon zing.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this product for anyone with an acid reflux problem.  I believe it will help you much more than the over the counter or prescription drugs recommend by doctors.

review/summary: It works. It tastes great. I wish it came in a loose pack!
review/text: This is a favorite Ginger Tea not only for medicinal purposes, but for warming up after a cold day, for any time.  It has a wonderful aroma. I generally use 2-3 teabags in a large (16 - 20oz) mug.  My family likes it so much we have it on a subscription so we never run out (plus, we're always dosing our friends and coworkers with it and turning them into believers, too!)<br /><br />This tea is good for so much more than nausea. I find it starts to settle any kind of intestinal disturbance in about fifteen minutes. Indigestion, gas, mild food poisoning cramps, helps settle motion sickness, even helps colds, flu, and sinus issues.  It's one of the first remedies I turn to for anyone who is feeling unsettled "down below".  It even mitigates -- lessens some of the cramping and gas -- the effects of "dumping" (anyone who has had gastric bypass should be familiar with this when we cheat and ingest something too sweet for our altered digestive systems to handle).<br /><br />I like this tea with a bit of sweetener and milk when I'm enjoying it for "any time".  Medicinally, perhaps with a little sweetener (I use stevia) and also, I use two or three bags at once and make sure it's very strong--steeped at least five or more minutes.<br /><br />Get this and a case of Gypsy Cold Care and Throat Coat, and you'll have a great start on some very effective and good tasting remedies for cold and flu season.

review/text: Recently, I've been searching for a good ginger tea.  Preferably, something that captures the awesome spiciness and flavor of ginger.  Well, I picked up this tea in a store because it clearly listed ginger as one of the top ingredients and you can even smell the spiciness in the tea bag.  However, once you brew it (and I let it steep a long time) you can't even taste any of the ginger.  What happened to all the spiciness?  I don't know, but it doesn't make a good ginger tea.  Furthermore, it doesn't even taste good otherwise, as it is really bland in flavor.<br /><br />I suppose that there are still some health benefits to drinking this tea, and it would be really good for someone who wants the benefits of ginger but cannot stand its taste.  Personally, though, I was really let down by this tea, hence the 2-star rating.<br /><br />I discovered that you can make tea by directly boiling some slices of fresh ginger root.  This produces a much more satisfying ginger taste and spiciness, and is a whole lot cheaper.  So, if you are searching for spicy ginger tea, just use a fresh root and skip expensive dried teas all together.

review/summary: Tastes bad
review/text: I can't speak of the benefits yet, but I'll comment on the taste. It doesn't really taste like ginger, it tastes like the spiciness left behind after you've eaten a sliver of it. It doesn't taste good, it's drinkable, but not pleasant. It's really spicy. All I taste is spice. It's not "strong" per say though. It also has stevia in it, and I can taste it, and I HATE STEVIA. Leaves a bad aftertaste. I will only buy this again if I notice any benefits, but I'm only on my second cup.

review/text: I have fibromyalgia which comes along with IBS and Vertigo.  I drink 3 cups of tea daily and have found that most of my symptoms for all these conditions are relieved.  I don't know what I would do if I could not get this tea.  If I am feeling dizzy I drink a cup and I feel relief.  I drink a cup before bedtime and find myself sleeping much better than before.  I highly recommend this tea to anyone with problems but also to everyone for a feeling of well being on a daily basis.

The chocolate flavors are quite good as well, but don't dissolve/set as well as this does.

If I really want to go nuts I put the Jello Banana Cream pudding in a pre-made mini graham cracker crust, spray some RediWhip on top, and then eat the resulting miniature banana cream pie!

I finished it because I had made it, but you would have to force me to eat it again.  I do not recommend.  Although, some people like the weird, fake flavor of banana.  If that's you, then you'd probably like this.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I was reading about house keeping and baking soda. I thought it will be really great. Because It has a lot of uses, cheap, not bad for you, and good for the earth.<br />This is how I use baking soda.<br />1. I use only 2/3 of laundry detergent and use 1/2 cup of baking soda. It makes clothes really clean and good for the world.<br />2. I use 1/2 spoon to wash my hair. My hair feels dried when it's wet. But later when my hair is dried, it feels really soft.<br />3.I exfoliate my face with baking soda like it says on the box. My skin looks clear and soft. I was using St.Ives scrub stuff. But I like baking soda more than that. Because its particles are really fine. So I just think it will be better for my skin.<br />4. I use this to take a shower. Put 1 spoon of it on shower clothes with body shower stuff. My skin feels dried but cleaner and later it gets not dried without lotion.<br />5. I use this to brush my teeth, too. I love it. It has salty taste.. You will may not like this. But after brushing, breath smells good, cleaner, and it is supposed to make teeth whiter.<br />I just love using baking soda now. I found 75 ways using baking soda by searching Google. I am expecting baby and I will use baking soda to clean my babies diapers, clothes later.<br />It has uses information on the back of the box. And You can give friends as a little gift. I ordered 3 boxes and gave 1 box to my friend and told him how to use them. And He loved it. Great thing to share i think..<br />I hope this is helpful for you.

review/summary: use in your swimming pool, too
review/text: You can use this in your swimming pool to raise alkalinity.  It's cheaper than the "Alkalinity Plus" product sold in swimming pool stores.  Use the same amount of baking soda that you would use of Alkalinity Plus.  1/3 pound of baking soda per 1000 gallons increases KH by 20 ppm (about 1 degree dKH).

review/summary: More Uses for Baking Soda
review/text: Arm & Hammer Baking Soda can be used to clean countertops, sinks, and appliances.  It can be used to deodorize the refrigerator, closets, car interiors, garbage cans, and food coolers.  It can be used to help clean the laundry.  It can extinguish  small grease and electrical fires in the kitchen.<br /><br />The use of baking soda for antacids is effective, but it should be used only rarely.  Any persistent indigestion requires medical attention.  What is "indigestion" could be a cardiac emergency.  Also baking soda has a high sodium content.<br /><br />It can be used to whiten teeth.  Some people use it for deodorant. A small amount in warm water makes an excellent gargle for a sore throat.<br /><br />It can be used to deodorize carpet and upholstery, but it is important to check for colorfastness in a small spot first.<br /><br />We use it for cooking.  My mother used it in her peanut brittle.  I remember how it used to foam when she added the baking soda, and her recipe is in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook  My friend Cathy uses baking soda in her delicious crawfish cornbread, and her recipe  is in  The Collard Patch  When we cook collard greens, we often add a tiny little pinch to the collards - only 1/8 teaspoon to tenderize the collard greens.  Several of the recipes in THE COLLARD PATCH include that little pinch of baking soda.

review/summary: Please, Sir, I want some more!
review/text: If baking soda is ever found to be toxic, I am totally boned.  I use it for cleaning my body, hair, teeth, hard household surfaces, laundry (as an add-in), and dishes, and also for de-stanking the cats' litter boxes.  The only downside to this product is that it isn't bigger.  I've used store-brand baking soda occasionally and I understand that it's the same thing, but the consistency is never the same as A&H.  To me, this is exactly the right consistency:  fine enough to blend into a recipe or solution but sufficiently abrasive to clean, when used that way.  It's even replaced my $xx Philosophy exfoliator and does a better job.  Yes, the big box can be a hassle, but I've purchased or re-purposed lots of smaller containers, china saucers and bowls, even silver salt cellars (which it keeps brilliantly un-tarnished) and when repackaged, it looks very exclusive and "special."  Who needs to know it's pennies an ounce and good for everything from the epidermis to the loo?

review/text: There are tons of environmentally and family friendly ways to use baking soda. We mainly use it for baking and cleaning purposes.<br /><br />This is not a bad deal, however, you should be aware that compared to purchasing it in the grocery store for about $1.40/lb, this actually costs more like $2/lb here on Amazon. However, if you compare a couple extra dollars (which I am sure pays for their "free" shipping to bring it right to your doorstep) to the cost of driving to the store and back, it's not that big a deal. Great product, good price. I'd recommend! :)

review/text: My dog is addicted to these treats!  He is a 90 lb Doberman who loves food, any food, anytime.  But for some reason, he loves these more than anything else I've ever given him, more than peanut butter, cheese, anything.  I just wish they came in a bigger size because each mini bone is TINY and is gone within 30-40 minutes (he really takes his time and carries it around for a while, so another dog might wolf it down much faster).  He hasn't had any issues with the small size in terms of choking but he is 8 years old and eats them very slowly so this might be an issue with other big dogs who eat things quickly.  I just wish I could find the same thing in a much larger size.

review/text: My Pom has always enjoyed Dingo chicken wrapped bones, but I was hesitant to change her treat to the peanut butter ones. She's pretty good about eating but will often leave the chewy parts behind. I offered this new peanut butter indulgence and she went crazy just smelling it. She jumped up, tried to take it from my hand, could barely contain herself long enough to sit on command for her treat. Once she received it, she turned around and immediately started devouring the end with the peanut butter. Nothing distracted her, not even her favorite buddy coming to visit. She ignored him in favor of the peanut butter. I'm very pleased with Dingo's products and have never had a bad one yet.

I would say if your up for a different type of liquorice than your normal red vine or twizzler try this brand, it was soft and chewy with lots of flavor. Since then I have bought several bags and continue to share this product with friends and family.

review/text: Not much strawberry flavor.  The entire contents of the bag stick together into one lump.  I didn't care for the "soft eating" part, licorice should be a little chewy.  The texture is to soft to describe; not quite food.  Might be excellent if you wear dentures.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: Usually, Im a fresh fish type of person. However, when I saw this unusual packaging and price, I decided to give this product ago. I will recommend it because it has an unsurpassable flavor that you usually do not find in packaged salmon. Plus the box is a neat keepsake for any fish enthusiast.

review/summary: Alaska Smokehouse Smoked Salmon
review/text: I ordered the Salmon on Thursday, January 11th and we received it on January 19th. The Salmon was delicious.  The wooden box has a nice design and can be used to store items in the future.
