review/summary: Small size Pill Pockets
review/text: This is the best thing since sliced bread.  Have had wonderful luck with pill giving since I started using these.  Small size will cover a smaller capsule and the dogs love the taste!  My guys jump up and scramble to get theirs!  Amazing product.  If<br /><br />your dog is extremely ill, nothing will entice them to eat - not even pill pockets. BUT 99 per cent of the time, these work!

review/summary: THANK GOODNESS FOR PILL POCKETS
review/text: WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  I was so impressed with this product, I just wrote a letter to the company (S & M NuTec)that developed and make them, telling them how thrilled I am.  I've got 3 elderly dogs all on daily medications ( two are on oral chemotherapy, one on Thyroid, one takes Arthritis Medications and one is on Antibiotics)....and they actually LOOK FORWARD to getting their pills!!!  I started out giving them an empty pouch or two then the one with a pill in it....and after the 3rd day, I didnt need the empty pouchs.<br /><br />No more wasted, half dissolved pills or capsules found in corners, no more dragging them out from under the kitchen table, no more cleaning the pill syringe after every use, no more prying open jaws.  NO MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS INFLICTED ON MY ELDERLY POOCHES ON A DAILY BASIS.<br /><br />I buy the LARGE size and cut them in half, then mold the pill around it, so I get 60 pieces out of the Large 30 chew bag.<br /><br />I see they now have Chicken available and will be ordering some of them too. THIS IS A MUST HAVE PRODUCT for Dog and Cat owners.

review/summary: I love Pill Pockets!
review/text: We have a new puppy who has to take antibiotics twice a day for kennel cough.  The puppy hates the pills and it took a lot of time and stress to get him to take them.  I did an internet search and found out about pill pockets.  I didn't buy from Amazon because I needed them right away, I paid $13 at Petco.  They are a lifesaver, we have the beef flavor and he eats it right up.  He loves them.<br /><br />Since the antibiotics will use up almost the whole bag I'm putting in an order through Amazon for more pill pockets to keep on hand.

review/summary: Worst smelling treat for dogs
review/text: My puppy loves Greenies pillpockets as a regular treat. When I first discovered this, it was at the vet's office and they used the beef flavored ones. Eventually, I decided to see how she would like the Duck and Pea flavor but when I opened the bag the odor from these treats made me, my roommate, and my boyfriend gag. Even the dog was less excited--and she loves (and I mean LOVES) the beef pill pockets. I set out one of each just to see what she'd go for and my vacuum cleaner of a dog went straight for the beef. She'll eat the duck one, but only if that's the only thing available. I had planned on trying the chicken flavor at some point too, but after this I think we'll be sticking with beef.

review/summary: Useless and gross
review/text: The pill pocket was way too large for the pill, and my crafty dog figured out right away how to get the pill out and eat the treat.  The pill pocket itself was overly oily and had a heavy smell that was difficult to wash off my hands after I handled the product.  After using two pockets -- and not getting a pill into my pooch, I threw away the rest of the bag.  Great idea, but a useless, ineffective, and nasty product.  If you want your dog to swallow pills without a fuss, roll the pill in homemade peanut butter paste (organic peanut butter and nutritional yeast); low-cost, easy clean up, and 100% success rate!

review/summary: BEWARE: terrible flavor of usually good product line
review/text: It looks as if the previous reviews are all for Pill Pockets in general, which are a great product for dogs.  This flavor variety, though, is horrible, judging by the packet I was sent.<br /><br />I opened the package, and they smelled exactly like (forgive the imagery) diarrhea.  And strongly.  I thought someone had had an accident until I realized where it was coming from.<br /><br />I thought maybe it was a flavor dogs like. You never know.  Some cheese smells bad too.  My poor dog spit it out and gagged when I fed it to him.<br /><br />This is either a very misguided flavor attempt, or the completely sealed package somehow went rotten (not a good sign), or they filled it with rotten product at the packaging stage (also not reassuring).<br /><br />Sickening, horrible, unfit to be put in the trash.  Had to flush it.

She's long given up PB on her pills, and has learned to spit out her pills that are wrapped in nitrite free deli meat, causing me to waste quite a bit before she gets it down.<br /><br />Looking for a cheaper alternative, these seem great, but the ingredients are not conducive for optimal health, especially a dog in our situation that has cancer.<br /><br />wheat flour, corn syrup, wheat gluten, vegetable oil should not be on the consumption list for a sick dog, let alone one for cancer. Sadly, my search goes on.<br /><br />Chicken, glycerin, wheat flour, natural flavors, dried corn syrup, corn flour, wheat gluten, chicken liver meal, vegetable oil, lecithin, brewer's dried yeast, potassium sorbate (to preserve freshness), methylcellulose, ascorbic acid (source of vitamin C), mixed tocopherols, vitamin E supplement.

review/summary: OK product but unnecessary...
review/text: Giving pills on a daily basis at an animal shelter, I have found that these provide no advantage over either breaking up the pill and mixing it in with canned food, or pushing the pill into a chunk of meat (in chunky canned food).  Some crafty dogs eat the pill pocket away from the pill and leave the pill untouched.  I suggest mixing pills in with something with a strong odor and flavor.  One trick is to push the pill into a bit of hotdog--no dog can resist that.

review/summary: Complete failure with my dog
review/text: My dachshund recently needed to start taking pills three times a day. He figured out there were sometimes pills in hot dog pieces (something to try nonetheless) so he began carefully checking each piece and spitting out the pills. So I tried Pill Pockets. The first one worked, and that was the last time. He won't even taste them now. So for me, Pill Pockets were expensive and ineffective. I now cook him up some chicken hearts and conceal the pills inside every day as needed while he isn't looking, then trim them down to barely cover the pill. I get him excited by quickly feeding him the trimmings, followed up by the main piece with the pill inside. On occasion he still finds them, but he likes chicken so much that it works quite well, so far, anyway.<br /><br />Obviously Pill Pockets work very good for most people, but not for me and my dog.

review/summary: A lifesaver for a pet owner whose pet spits out its pills!
review/text: My 1-year-old Shih Tzu, Missy, was recently diagnosed with a skin infection and allergies, so the vet prescribed an antibiotic and an allergy med twice a day.  At first, I thought it was going okay with my hiding the pills in a piece of banana or cheese...but then, I started finding pills all over the place...she'd been appearing to eat the food while in front of me and then going elsewhere to spit out the pills!<br /><br />I was seeing my money go down the drain as these antibiotics and allergy meds went anywhere (including staining my carpet!) but IN HER TUMMY!  Finally, a friend who has a cat suggested pill pockets, so I ordered a small packet of these beef flavored ones to see if they would work.<br /><br />WELL!  She not only takes her meds now, but she BEGS for them as soon as she sees me open the package of pill pockets!  I am FINALLY seeing her skin clear up because the pills are FINALLY getting into her system...today I gave her a bath and her skin is clear!<br /><br />My only issue with the pill pockets (the ONLY reason I gave them 4 stars vs. 5) is that they are very soft and mooshy...I guess this is necessary so that you can mold the pill pocket around the pill, regardless of its shape or size...but I find it a little yucky.  A few months ago, I may also have complained about the VERY strong smoky smell (like beef jerky), but I've gotten used to that via some treats Missy that loves.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering these again...in a larger quantity!

review/summary: Perfect (but PRICEY) Pill Pockets
review/text: For those picky dogs that don't want to take pills, this is the solution. I tried to hide my dog's pills in peanut butter, cheese, and cold cuts, none of which worked. I purchased both the roasted duck, which is for allergies, and chicken flavored pockets and tried out both of the sizes (pockets for tablets and capsules) as well. My dog much preferred the chicken flavor. I preferred the pill pockets in the capsule size. This is because these pockets are larger. Even though the tablet sized pockets are large enough for any tablet, the capsule size allow me to get twice as many pill pockets for my money. I split them in two and can still fit a tablet inside each half*... just a TIP for those wanting to save a bit of $

review/text: Since my dog is a chewer rather than a chomper, it has always been difficult to give her pills.  I had tried hiding the pills (crushed or whole) in various foods or dog treats, but she'd always sniff it out and/or bite into it and then refuse to eat it.  Pill Pockets has an oily texture that she can just gulp right down.  I find one capsule-size Pill Pocket to be way too big for 1 capsule, so I just mash it down and mold it separately over the 3 pills that she has to take.

review/text: It's really tough to give my dog his pills. He seems to know when there is a pill inside a lump of dog food. He'll enevitably eat the treat but leave or spit up the pill. Well, now this doesn't happen. These treats... Pill pouches have a compartment inside you can stick the pill in, and squeeze the pouch shut and voila! The dog has a little sealed pouch of treat to eat. The large size can be cut in half for smaller dogs like our paps.<br /><br />If you have to give pills to your dogs and they are no longer fooled by the lump of peanut butter or the hotdog... Try these... They work great especially if you have to give dogs pills frequently.

He's smart enough to chomp on whatever else I try and then spit the pill back out.  These, however, work great.  I wish I had read the product description closer, my fault.  This is only the 25 count.  I can get 30 for only a couple dollars more locally, so will probably just do that in the future.  Shipping was fast and my dog loves them, so its still a win.  Highly recommend them, as my dog sometimes has a sensitive stomach to treats and certain people foods.  He can take the beef or chicken ones, as well.

review/text: My dog is 12, and has had constantly firm stool his whole life.  After a dental surgery, I used these, and assume the medicine was giving him diarrhea.  After he was better, and no more pills... I was still using these leftover pockets to smear into an old hollow bone (they are very pliable and many are cracked and smoooooshed, already, prior to opening the package), and he continued to have diarrhea.  I was just worried something happened due to the mediciation, but finally put two and two together.  Googling these pill pockets, diarrhea is a side effect.  So be aware.  These work well for the pill part, but the drawbacks are there too.<br /><br />Also, I haven't talked about diarrhea this much in my whole life.  I have heard the only time it's good to have diarrhea is in scrabble, because it's worth a crapload of points. I saw someone on Twitter ask Greenies if Diarrhea was a side effect.. the question is hilarious: [...]<br /><br />Anyhoo... we love our dogs.  We hate messy poop.  There may be better ways.  Making the poopy that loose makes me think it can't be too healthy?

review/summary: Great for Dogs on Hypoallergenic Diets
review/text: I have been extremely satisfied with the Greenies Pill Pockets Roasted Duck and Pea Formula. To clarify, this is the same as "Allergy Formula" (it's written on front of the package), although on amazon it is listed as a separate product.<br /><br />My dog is on a novel protein source diet and cannot eat the beef or chicken Pill Pockets, although he must take daily medications.  Getting him to take his daily medications was a huge hassle until I found out about these.<br /><br />I do agree with a previous reviewer about the smell and color of these duck/pea Pill Pockets.  The smell is unfortunate, to say the least, and the color is interesting-looking.  If my dog did not have allergic issues, I would definitely give him the regular beef or chicken flavor Pill Pockets instead.<br /><br />However, comparing the two products, I believe one reason the Allergy Formula Pill Pockets have a certain odd color is due to lack of added color. In other words, they have a more natural color. In the beef Pill Pockets, "caramel color" is one of the ingredients, but it is not in the Allergy Formula.  In case, anyone is interested, these are the ingredients in the Roasted Duck and Pea Allergy Formula: duck, glycerin, dried peas, natural flavors, vegetable oil, water, salt, potassium sorbate (to preserve freshness), xanthan gum, citric acid, preserved with mixed tocopherals (a source of Vitamin E).<br /><br />My dog likes the Allergy Formula Pill Pockets just as well as the regular Pill Pockets, so the offensive smell does not seem to affect him at all.<br /><br />Finally, I saw in an earlier review where someone said these were smaller than the normal "capsule" size.  I have NOT found this to be true. I have ordered several times and every time, the capsule size is the same as for the regular beef or chicken flavor Pill Pockets.  This means that usually you can break one in two, so they go twice as far.  The texture of these Pill Pockets is just as malleable as the normal ones and it's quite easy to hide a pill in them.  All in all, I highly recommend if your dog has allergy issues and can't take the normal ones.

This suits me fine, since the tablet pockets are cheaper.<br /><br />I took one star off because the ingredients are questionable, lots of chemicals, color, corn syrup and other crap.  If my dog were not that old that his comfort is more important to me than his health, I honestly wouldn't go near them.<br /><br />Also, he will not touch the duck flavor, though, but I reviewed this flavor separately.

review/summary: Great as training treats!
review/text: I took my golden retriever puppy to obedience school and these were the treats that they recommended for all the dogs for training! I break each treat into about four pieces so that after she does something right she gets a quick reward. My dog doesn't go wild for food/treats but she will do absolutely ANYTHING for one of these. Whenever she is running around outside and I can't get her to come back in all I have to do is hold up this bag and shake it and she will come running full speed from half a mile away.<br /><br />A MUST BUY FOR TRAINING PUPPIES OR DOGS!

review/summary: Be careful, made 1 of my dogs very ill
review/text: I must admit these do work for getting your pets to take pills - 2 very finicky dogs who almost always spit out their pills in any food did scarf their pills down when put in these.  However, after only 2 pills (separated by 8 hours), one of my dogs (8 month old puppy) became violently ill about 2 hours after the 2nd pill pocket with numerous episodes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting (ultimately very bloody after 12 hours).  It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this).  The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see).  Our other dog (full adult) did fine, however.  Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it's just an unusual reaction, but if you google "pill pockets diarrhea", you will see this is an occasional known side effect.<br />Would suggest trying just one of these each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds.

review/text: I have a fussy eater on my hands and a VERY smart dog.  I've used hot dogs, banana, peanut butter, etc... he eventually figured out a pill was in every one of those and would either refuse it, spit it out, or eat around the pill.  My boy has to take pills twice a day probably forever; so far so good on pill pockets - it's been over a year and he hasn't figured it out.  He considers it a treat and LOVES them.  They are soft so I can form the pocket around the pill.  To make them last a bit longer, I split it in half since his pills aren't very big.

review/summary: Perfect for Giving Medications to Our Dogs
review/text: Every month, we give our three dogs (two Aussies and a Golden/Flat-Coat Retriever mix) pills for flea/tick/worm repellant.  In addition, one of our Aussies needs daily thyroid pills.  We found Pill Pockets is the very best way to do this.  Opening the mouth wide and trying to put the pill waaay in the back of the mouth before clamping the jaws shut and massaging the throat until the poor dog swallows is a bad thing to do to a beloved pet.  It's bad because Pill Pockets make this chore a happy and delicious time for the dog involved.  The Pockets (in the pet store we use) come in chicken or beef flavors, so we alternate flavors every time we buy a new supply.  Everybody is happy, and the dogs get the required meds.

Chicken and Beef work ok most times but the dogs have never not wanted to take their pill when we use this Duck flavor.<br /><br />The consistency is excellent for being able to wrap around a small pill or to break apart and use only half at a time if needed. The smell is just enough to help hide the scent of the pills. The dogs just love it when I open up the pouch and come running to take their pills.

review/text: I love these, we have a cat that is impossible to administer pills to, but she goes stark freaking INSANE for these pill pockets. We used the feline size, which has more pockets in it than the dog size. However at one point she had to take a couple of pills at the same time and I could not fit all the pills into the cat-size pocket, so I bought the dog size. All kitty knew was hey, I'm getting a BIGGER treat than normal!<br /><br />If you have a dog that takes micro doses of tablets or just one small tablet, get the cat size and they'll go much farther.<br /><br />I purchased the chicken dog pockets for my cat and she loved them. That seems to be the flavor most of my cats like.

Lucky me, I was prepared because I had already purchased these pill pockets.  I carefully slipped the heartworm pill into one and pinched it closed, then gave him the good boy talk.  He took the pill pocket and thoroughly enjoyed eating it, including the insert.  Problem solved.<br /><br />Whoever came up with this idea has my thanks.  These would have saved me a lot of trouble in the past with other dogs.  I just hope Puka doesn't catch on as he gets older.  I'm thinking about giving him a pinch of one every now and then to reinforce it being a treat instead of medicine.  They are very soft and sticky and apparently very tasty.

review/text: This is both a blessing and a curse.  The blessing part is these pill pockets are pretty much perfect.  They take a pill very nicely, cover it, and make it wonderfully desirable for the dog to eat the pills.  "Serve with food because it's so bitter your dog will hate you forever" is not a match for these little suckers.  Little dog loves these, and would happily snarf down the entire packet if she could.  As for the curse... well, you can no longer safely move pill containers anywhere.  With a keen ear and a taste for beef pill pockets, your dog will hear you shift your containers even one nanometer and come running, expecting you to give it a treat.  My Dad has to take pills twice daily... you can see why this is an issue.<br /><br />Sealed air tight for freshness.  Approximately 30 to a bag.  Suitable for small pills.  Tasty, yet functional.  A fantastic delivery system for an otherwise annoying problem.  5 stars.

review/summary: Worked perfectly
review/text: I have great animals that are usually willing to do whatever I ask of them.  Unfortunately my male dog gets anal gland infections once or twice a year.  I have tried many ways of administering his antibiotics from coating with peanut butter/cream cheese or wrapping in slices of cheese.  All of these methods work for the first few days but over time he decides the treat isn't worth while so I end up forcing the pill down his throat and giving a treat afterwards as a reward for being tolerant.  Eventually he starts refusing his treat and looks at me like I'm abusing him, lol.  So this time I decided to try Greenies pill pockets.  I chose the capsule size since they are supposed to be larger and he needed to take three pills at a time.  I also chose the duck and pea formula to provide a unique flavor.  Each night he watched me place the antibiotics in the pocket and form a nice ball then eagerly took his treat.  They apparently smell very appealing as my female dog also begged for them and we have to store them in a cabinet because the cat tried to help himself by chewing on the bag.  By the end of the first week, all three animals would line up in the kitchen at the end of the night waiting for their treat!  They did leave a strong smelling oily residue on my fingers but washed off quickly and easily with just a little water and friction.  Purchased through Amazon with Prime shipping.  Arrive quickly in perfect condition.

review/summary: Helpful to get pickey eaters to take their medication.
review/text: My one doxie won't eat either the chicken or beef flavored pill pockets, but he will eat the "Duck and Pea" flavor; this is also the formula to buy if your dog has allergies.  The product smells quite strong when you first open the pouch; I suspect the peas give it that distinct odor. I don't need to use the entire pocket per pill, so I break a section off of the capsule just large enough to encapsulate the size pill I need to administer, forming the soft, pliable substance around it.  It is most economical to buy the capsule size, so I do so, but they also come in a smaller, pill size shape.<br /><br />I haven't purchased the pill pockets for my cats yet and don't know how they would be received, but this product has helped me give my dogs medication.  Even when the pill is supposedly chewable, and "liver-flavored," my dogs will generally not take their medication willingly unless I disguise it first.  These can make your life with your pet easier. Shop around for the best price as these can be a bit expensive if you have to use them frequently.

review/text: Although these don't have the most pleasant scent, their effectiveness render's my nose's experience immaterial. These Greenies never fail to fulfill their purpose; once thoroughly surrounded by the pill pocket, any pill, capsule, or necessity I'd otherwise have to battle to shove down my dog's throat gets gobbled up. Actually, swallowed without chewing is more accurate. My dog has become increasingly sensitive with age, and she has shown signs of mild to severe allergies, digestive, dermatological and other manifestations. Not once has she experienced any hint of an adverse reaction to these. Without hesitation, I strongly recommend this product and flavor. These are a staple in our house, and I will continue to purchase these pill pockets in the pea and duck formula monthly.

review/summary: Probably A Good Product, Just Not For Sweet Girl!
review/text: When I got these in the mail last Saturday and opened them up, put in a pill that she absolutely hates the smell of, offered it to her and she gulped it down we were thrilled to death!  We have not been able to get this dog to take this particular medication using everything from hot dogs to hamburgers and several kinds of cheese, so when she ate this thing like it was candy my wife and I were both excited.  Then that afternoon for her last dose for the day, same performance.  We thought we had found the answer to our prayers as she has a disease that can't be cured if she doesn't take this medication until it's all gone.  So this was a Godsend!<br /><br />But, the very next morning, before she had anything else to eat, my wife tried to give her a pill using a Pocket and she turned her nose up at it and walked away!!  She tried several times with varying amounts of the pocket cut off to make it smaller for her and easier to gulp down.  Still no go.  So we waited a couple of hours, without feeding her anything at all, tried again, same thing.<br /><br />So I saw a bag of Pockets in Walmart and the only thing they had besides Beef was Duck so I tried that.  Same thing.  Wouldn't even eat one so we're back to looking for something else that might work.  If your dog will eat them they are GREAT!!

review/summary: These are indeed Life Savers
review/text: If you've ever tried to get your dog to swallow pills, you know how wonderful these are.  We have four dogs (three Corgis and a mixed breed), and all like them, and these have been successful with them all.<br /><br />Our mixed breed dog was about 13, and her disease was terminal, and we weren't ready to lose her (not that anyone ever is).  We had medicines that would make her comfortable in her final stages, but the problem was getting her to take them...we tried all sorts of things: peanut butter, apple sauce, fruit, meat--all had a certain ability to disguise the taste, but she got wise to them pretty quickly.<br /><br />But the Greenies Pill Pockets ALWAYS worked.  We were able to extend her life, with comfort, for a couple of months longer, and for that I'll always be grateful.<br /><br />A NOTE: The Greenies come in several flavors (chicken, beef, duck & peas), sizes, and also flavors for cats.  If you need to be more economical, you can also "shave" them down by squeezing off a little of them (depending on the strength of the pill they're taking).

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: We have had a number of cats with medical problems and tried any number of ways to get pills into them.  Pill Pockets are by far the easiest method.<br /><br />Most of our animals have considered Pill Pockets as "treats" and readily eaten them.  Our current feline gets three pockets in the morning and three in the evening, so we go through a lot.<br /><br />One suggestion:  if your smaller pet needs to take many meds, buy the pockets designed for capsuls for dogs.  Product pricing seems to be related to the number of "doses", rather than the weight.  I believe the small package for cats is 1.6 oz and costs only a few $ less than this 6.6 oz package. If you go through the pockets like we do, the savings are substantial.  We simply tear off a piece of the larger pocket and wrap it around the pill.  It takes 15 seconds.<br /><br />Another suggestion is to get a selection of flavors.  Our cat goes through periods where certain flavors are unacceptable, so it is good to alternate and have backups.<br /><br />If you are really desperate, you can always use human meat baby food.  We haven't seen a cat yet that would't take that.<br /><br />Summary:  A much better way to give your pet meds than a pill shooter.

review/summary: Fabulous product for small pills!
review/text: First off, I have found that buying these treats on Amazon is cheaper than purchasing them at PetSmart. I buy the capsule version of the Pill Pockets versus the tablet version because the bags are larger (it holds more ounces) and the cost difference is almost nothing. I then break that one capsule up into many pieces because they are soft & malleable. I am able to get that one bag to last me for many servings. I only use it to wrap up my dog's Prozac pill.  He will gobble it down with no problem. However, if I try to use any larger pill such as a Heartworm pill or Allergy pill in them, he will eat the treat part off & spit out the medicinal pill. For those types of pills, I just crush them up and stir them in some wet food for him.

review/text: we tried alot of things to hide pills in.  our dog would maybe fall for it once or twice, but then would spit out the pills and eat the cheese, peanut butter, hot dog, etc. that it was wrapped in.  But then we found pill pockets and he likes them enough to eat them and the pill inside.  the best thing is how easy it is to form them around different pills, and how you can only use pieces of one pill pocket on smaller pills to make them stretch farther.

They can be kind of pricey, especially if you have a dog that requires daily medication, as they only come 30 in a pack and retail for $7.99 (cheaper on amazon of course!).  I would definitely recommend them if you have a dog that has trouble taking his pills.

review/text: Like most dogs I have met, our dogs HATE getting their meds. These things take the headache out of giving medication to dogs.  The dogs get so excited for these pill pockets, and they are easy to use.  The pockets are very soft, so if you live in a hot and humid place, they will turn into a pile of mush.  However, you can easily just take a piece of mush and wrap it around the pill.  The dogs don't care if it is shaped properly or not.  Our dogs just swallow it hole and sit there waiting for another one.

review/summary: Mmmmm Nando's
review/text: Living in the UK, my husband and I enjoyed Nando's frequently.  However, in The States, there are apparently no Nando's! I am trying to understand how this could be when there are a million other mediocre restaurants here.  KFC's nasty and fatty tasting chicken and sides could be well replaced with Nando's flame grilled peri-peri chicken dishes and their sides are better too... corn on the cob, chips(fries) with peri-peri spice which also taste great dipped in the Nando's peri-peri sauce, garlic bread, and my favourite spicy rice!<br /><br />Seriously, if you haven't tried Nando's sauce you need to because it's the best marinade I've ever tasted.  If you live in The States it will be unlike anything you've ever had before and you'll love it.  My only suggestion is that unless you like VERY spicy and hot foods, try the Medium Peri-Peri sauce first.  The medium is actually plenty hot enough for me.  However, I understand that the more hot chillis one can consume the better for their metabolism and health.  So, Nando's is not only a tasty choice, it is also a healthy one.

review/text: Everytime I visit Slough (UK) from the US I eat at Nando's.  In fact, I eat there nearly everyday.  Why? Well...the only other viable food choices in Slough are: spread meat sandwiches (with butter, sweet corn, free-range eggs, rocket, and mature cheese) at Amys (yuck!)..."unnamed" department store (made me sick)...or McDonalds/Burger King/Pizza Hut/Subway (I can get those down the street). But most importantly, it's the Peri Peri Sauce!<br /><br />Though created for Nando's chicken, Peri Peri sauce is especially tastey as a dipping sauce for french fries.  Thanks to Amazon.com, I can enjoy Peri Peri sauce everyday right here in the United States.<br /><br />Warning: the "hot" is plenty hot enough.  The extra hot is ridiculously hot!

It is particularly a delicious additive to shrimp and chicken.<br /><br />Alas to say, I do not have the courage to sample "Hot Hot Peri-Peri Sauce."<br /><br />It is sun-ripend, and the exotic mix of herbs and spices is what makes it pass with flying colors.  Really a treat.<br /><br />Be sure to keep it refrigerated after opening.  One warning:  check the shipping fees.  They are steep.  But since the seller's website has a $20.00 minimum on orders, unless you want to buy more than one item, Amazon seems the best way.

review/text: There aren't any Nando's restaurants in my area (yet!) but I've long enjoyed their Hot Peri-Peri sauce.  It's one of the best of the many (well over 100) I've tried.  And while it's genuinely hot, it isn't overwhelmingly, inedibly so, as are some that vie for world's hottest honors.  But it's not just the right level of hotness that makes this so good.  It has a successful and unique recipe, which is rare, in my experience.  I more often prefer the simpler sauces that are little or nothing more than chili, vinegar and salt.  I've been to many other Portugese barbeque restaurants, and this would be ideal for the grilled chicken that is their specialty, so I'm definitely looking forward to my first visit to Nando's.

If you want something much hotter then purchase texas tongue torch from the same company.  I eat hot sauce on just about all my food. I visit the local hot sauce store who sells nothing but hot sauce on a weekly basis to check out new arrivals and purchase something different.  Fire in the hole is in my top 5.

review/text: We used to be able to find this in Phoenix, but it has been out of the area for a long time.  I was very excited to find a case on Amazon and quickly bought one.  It came very quickly and made my husband a happy camper.<br /><br />I read the ingredients list and was disappointed.  I thought it was maple syrup years ago.  Maybe I was mistaken.  This case contains bottles mostly filled with corn syrup and flavorings.  However, it tastes just as good, so maybe that is the original recipe.<br /><br />I just wish that there were some "real" maple ingredients in the syrup.

review/summary: My Dog Loves It
review/text: My older Lhasa Apso is a very fussy eater.  She tended to want dog foods that were not rated as good for her.  I went on line and searched for healthy food and tried some of them.  Until I tried Hills which she loves and begs for more.  Thank you Hills for making a Great Dog Food!

review/summary: UNBELIEVABLY RICH AND CREAMY!!!
review/text: This is so beyond the idea of calling something "cheese" as it is the most creamy and elegant substance made from milk, cream, and the contents that comes from cows.  The French know what to do with grapes and also packing a wallop with cheese products.  Try this at your own risk!  You will never taste anything like this again!

review/summary: Healthy grains!
review/text: I bought these grains for my boyfriend who needs probiotics but hates the taste of my milk kefir. These grains arrived quickly. As others have noted, the seller is thoughtful. They sent along over a sheet of information on rehydrating and culturing your water kefir. We followed the instructions to the letter, and it took about two weeks for these guys to plump back up. We had placed them in a jar with distilled water, a few drops of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AMUWLK">Liqumins ConcenTrace Trace Mineral Drops, Low Sodium, 8-Ounce Bottle</a>, and some sugar and placed a lid loosely on the jar. Then we set the jar next to our crock-pot, because these microbes like the warmth. A few days ago, we strained the first batch of water kefir, and I'm happy to report it was a success! My fella said it tasted like apple cider. He's happy with the taste, and I'm happy he's getting the probiotics. We have started experimenting with adding various fruits to see how they alter taste, too.<br /><br />Terrific seller. Healthy kefir grains. You can't go wrong.

review/summary: water kefir grains
review/text: These grains came to me quickly and were packaged in sweet little containers. I began my ferment with the grains, water and palm sugar. The kefir turned out marvelous with a sweet taste and the grains plumped up with a golden sparkle.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I drink water kefir every day since I got these grains. They rehydrate in the time frame specified and produce a drink that really benefits your digestive system. The Keysands company (which seems to be just a family working out their home) is really helpful with any questions you email them about. Recommended.

review/summary: CRAZY CRYSTALS!
review/text: A friend introduced my wife and I to kefir (most people pronounce it like the actor, Kiefer - but if you want to say it right, it's "ke-FEAR"). The grains she gave us were for milk, and we tried them, but got a bit of a tummy upset. Besides, we've been weaning ourselves off all dairy products. My wife read up on the water kefir grains and liked what she saw. The price+shipping gave us pause, but then we figured it was a one-time purchase, after all. The grains multiply, so all you ever need to do is buy them once.<br /><br />She ordered the Keysands organic crystals, and put them to work. We've tried all kinds of fruit juices, producing refreshing, mildly fermented, fizzy drinks - delicious!<br /><br />When I was a kid, my dad loved ginger beer - a non-alcoholic soft drink. We decided to make kefir ginger beer - which does have a little alcohol in the finished product, because kefir grains cause fermentation. We blend raw ginger root, add some sugar to taste (it should be sweet before the kefir does its work). We ferment it in glass gallon jugs to begin with, then transfer it to the Grolsch-type beer bottles (also called "swing-top" bottles) - the ones with the reusable caps that lock down on a wire hinge.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XUA6UY">1 Liter Round Italian Swing Top Glass Bottle</a><br /><br />The result is fantastic - a really flavorful kefir drink with all kinds of health benefits - ginger alone is said to cleanse the blood and tune up your digestive system, and the healthy fermentation bacteria kefir produces is said to excellent for your intestines as well.<br /><br />The kefit grains keep on multiplying once you get them going, and you just transfer them from one batch to another.<br /><br />If you're into healthy eating and drinking for you and your loved ones, you won't want to miss out on "water kefir"!<br /><br />Next up for us - kefir beer, a mildly alcohol containing drink, made with real hops and malt. Can't wait! The kefir adventure continues!<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: no complaints
review/text: The shipment arrived relatively quickly (1 week or so), and it came with twice the amount of grains that other places are selling for the same price.<br /><br />It arrived in a bubble envelope with the grains in a sealed plastic bag, with printed out instructions on how to rehydrate the grains and make water kefir. I rehydrated them according to the instructions and by the end of the first 24 hours they were looking rehydrated, by the end  of 48 hours the sugar water solution smelled like fermentation was starting.<br /><br />When fully rehydrated, it comes out to 8Tbs of kefir grains, or enough for 2qts of kefir brewing at one time (more than enough!).<br /><br />EDIT! After one fermentation (using 3T white table sugar and 1T molasses), I now have 11T kefir grains!  The molasses doesn't give the best taste to it, but definately makes healthy grains reproduce. So, if you're wondering if you'll receive healthy grains.... you will.
