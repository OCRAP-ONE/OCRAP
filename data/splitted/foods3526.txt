review/text: I love ONE coconut water. I've tried some other brands and some taste good but ONE is my favorite. I like that coconut water has so many electrolytes, which I am typically low on, so it's better for me than just plain water. I'm now into ONE Active but that is not as readily available. I highly recommend ONE coconut water if you're at all curious or low on potassium, especially.

I liked the Vita Coconut juice with flavors since the taste was light and not too sweet or overpowering. This was just horrible in that it totally overpowered the taste of the coco water and it was so sweet / artificial tasting. I just wish I could return food items b/c this is terrible.

review/summary: How much do straws cost anyway?
review/text: I like that this convenient container holds a healthier, natural 'energy' drink, that quickly gets cold in a frig or cooler.  Since I'm not a big fan of coconut water to start with, I tried this mango splash, but it's a very mild mango flavor - not enough for my taste.  I might try the pineapple next, because I think pineapple has a stonger flavor and goes well with coconut.  While you can easily poke a hole through the top to drink, I really wonder why the company shows a straw on the package and designs it to easily use a straw, but for some reason doesn't include any in the package.  How much do straws cost anyway?

review/text: Personally, I do not like coconut at all or anything that has coconut flavors. I've been like that all my life. I'm like the only one in my family that doesn't like coconut. For some reason, I decided to give this a try. I bought the mango flavor to help me with drinking the coconut water and I was surprised. It didn't have the strong coconut flavor that I have tasted in other foods or beverages. I barely even tasted the coconut. If I didn't know this was coconut water with mango, I would have thought it was some other drink,and this is all natural. I've been hearing alot of good things about coconut water. I just hope that it doesn't upset my stomach later on because I've been having digestive issues so I'm keeping my fingers crossed. So now I'm thinking of trying just plain coconut water and see how that turns out.

review/text: I decided to pick up O.N.E. coconut water with a splash of passion fruit to diversify my coconut water consumption. I usually just buy pure coconut water. I was surprised at how sweet the drink was given that it had a "splash" of passion fruit. Typically after I drink coconut water, I feel refreshed. However, this drink left me with so much of a sweet aftertaste that I felt a tall drink of water was in order after I was done.

Not only that, but including the fast priority shipping which was about $6 (came in 3 days) the price was still under most of other similar products not including shipping! The colors were all pretty evenly dispersed (unlike the other misleading product on amazon, which only gave mostly lemon warheads) and I got 15 extra! I've only eaten a few so far but they were pretty fresh and no duds or melted ones yet. What more could you ask for!?<br /><br />Basically to sum it up.<br />Pros:<br />-I got 15 extra warheads<br />-even number of each flavor<br />-fresh and sour<br />-fast delivery<br />-cheap as monkeys!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I got a like 4 empty warheads but how can you call that a con<br />when they gave me 15 extra!<br /><br />Buy from these guys, they know real service.

Judging from my bag it appears to have at least a 5 month shelf life.

My wife advised me that in the future it was Leonidas or nothing.<br /><br />They are machine-made so the price is not bad (as opposed to the hand-made varieties), but they are also made fresh without preservatives so they need to be eaten or refrigerated quickly. In this house, the refrigerator rarely sees the package.<br /><br />They are excellent and a treat you owe yourself.

review/text: We have lived in Belgium for 8 of the last 24 months.  There is no question that the cheapest Belgian chocolate is better than anything you can buy in America.  It is tough for us to gag down American chocolate anymore.  They grind the cocoa beans finer and use less fat and less sugar, so it is much better for you. I am diabetic and it does not send my sugars up.<br /><br />Belgians have very strong opinions when it comes to which chocolate is "best".  They don't always agree, but more Belgians said Leonida's was the best than any other single brand we heard.  This is not something you eat. You savor and treasure every piece.  The price is good and you will not be disappointed.

From my experience, I can assure you that if you ever have any problem, Leonidas will be courteous and considerate in dealing with you. As for the chocolate, my husband and I are very fond of dark chocolate and have tried many brands before. We found Leonidas ideally bittersweet in its taste and also generous in quantity. In fact, the best of all the European brands we've tried in our five years of dating. It's the kind of chocolate that you not only would buy for gifts but would also want to buy and keep for your snack.

review/text: If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />If being "in love" gives you a zest for life, then the "I Love You" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection (dark if you order this box):<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's R�verie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: This was a great gift for a party!
review/text: This was a great gift for a party. The dark chocolate is not bitter like many others. I've had many different types of chocolate from Belgium and all over, and can guarantee that Leonidas is the best af all of chocolatiers. Great sampling of ivory, milk and dark chocolate. If you love chocolate try it. You will not regret it.

review/summary: Makes a great present!
review/text: I recently bought this item for a friend whom I rarely get to see because we live far away from one another.  Her birthday was coming right up, and I found out from another friend that she loved dark chocolate.  Amazon.com shipped the item very quickly.  I had been contemplating sending the item with expedited service, but ended up assuming my friend wouldn't care one way or the other if the item arrived on time for her birthday.  In fact, the item showed up just two days later, ON TIME for her birthday, when I had just paid for standard delivery.  My friend immediately sent me a very excited e-mail thanking me for the present, and said that she loved it.  Thanks, amazon!

This chocolate is the best ever and after tasting and finishing off the entire box we couldn't wait to get another. That will have to wait though for the price but it was worth what we paid. Do yourself a favor and pay the price just to try it out. I really didn't know much about this type of chocolate and took a chance and got a box. This was a Christmas present for my wife but after all the good stuff we read we had to break into it a month early. I thought to myself how much differently could this really taste than the American chocolate I am used to.

review/summary: Satisfying
review/text: This year we ordered these dark chocolates and also bought a package of dark chocolates from Godiva. The Godiva dark chocolate box is $36 for 10.5 oz. (really, it's on their website). These are the same price for a full pound. And they come from Belgium, where people are very fussy about chocolates, and proud of their chocolates. It is not just the price. The taste difference is amazing. These are the real thing, a pleasure from first to last. We lived in France, where chocolate shops abound, and Leonidas was quite competitive against the artisan shops.

It is not shipped in any special insulation beyond a hefty Styrofoam insert that holds the chocolates inside the shipping box, so you definitely want to order this during the cool months--I'm sure it will melt en route during the summer.

review/summary: Quality ingredients produce quality chocolates!
review/text: I give these chocolates to others for special occasions as gifts. They have never let me down. When you say Belgium, I say Leonidas. Dark chocolate can be an aquired taste, to know what is good. This dark chocolate is superb! In bars you can tell the crisp fresh break of quailty dark chocolate and the aroma and the taste. These creams just blend their ingredients with the dark chocolate to create an exquisite taste. Bottom line, They don't skimp on the ingredients and as long as they don't, I will continue to buy their products. The packaging is great because it comes gift wrapped already. I would like to see how its made and the people who make it.<br />Cheaper than a ticket to Belgium and always delivered fresh!

review/summary: Average chocolate, strong fillings
review/text: These are definitely "mid-range" chocolates, not quite as good as Godiva or See's. If you're used to low-end chocolates like Fannie May or Russell Stover, you'll probably find these to be very good. However, if you're used to very good chocolates like La Maison du Chocolat, you'll be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />I found the chocolate to have unexceptional flavor and a somewhat waxy texture. The fillings were mostly very sweet or alcoholic, which is a common practice to cover up mediocre chocolate.<br /><br />I guess they're a good value compared to Godiva, although I think See's Candies has an even better value. Don't expect Leonidas to compare to a high-end chocolatier.

review/text: Let's be clear about one thing, I likes my cake mixes.  You've heard the rhetorical phrase "Does a fat kid like cake?"  The original phrase was: "Does Tim like cake?" but it was changed due to some confusion that it caused for folks who knew other people named Tim... apparently some of whom did not care for cake, but I digress.  I knew when I saw the $34.00 price tag, this was gonna be a special cake mix.  Sure, the temptation was there to go with the "Buy it Used" option to save a few bucks... but since my intention was to wash this cake down with some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032G1S0">Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz</a>, I thought why cheap out on the cake mix?  It did not disappoint.  Moist and delicious.  10 times better than the $4.00 cake mixes you find at your local store, so there's your value right there.

review/summary: Good Tea.
review/text: Sweetheart Cinnamon is an herb tea with a blend of delicious sweet apple and exotic cinnamon. It is all natural and caffeine free. It also has hibiscus, rose blossoms, rose hips, and licorice root in it. I love the flavor! This tea is going on my list to buy when I run out. Not as apple flavored as I would have liked, but still good.

review/summary: Mmmmm Cinnamon
review/text: I first tried this flavor in a variety pack at Sam's Club.  The box also had an Apple Cider flavor, but this one has much more cinnamon flavor.  I really liked it, but I couldn't find it by itself locally, so I ordered the six pack from Amazon.  I seem to taste more apple flavor in the ones I received from Amazon, but it may just be my imagination.  I do still like this flavor, but I don't find myself drinking it as much as I initially thought I would.  My daughter and husband initially liked it, but have since decided that they don't.  I think it is one of those teas that taste good while hot, but not as much if you let it sit.

review/text: I love the Cinnamon apple tea.  It is like a cup of hot cider without the calories.  I took a box to where I workout (they supply hot water and tea for us) and it disappeared very fast.  It was a big hit! It is by far my favorite.  My daughter is hooked on the Ginger snappish.  We recommend both of them to anyone who likes a good cup of tea.  As always, Amazon.com is a great place to order items from--competitive pricing, free and fast delivery--what more could you ask for!

review/summary: Incredible, unique herbal tea...
review/text: Hmm... I wonder what the previous reviewer was looking for when he ordered Bigelow Sweetheart Cinnamon and was disappointed. It's honestly an incredible non-caffeinated/herbal tea - a totally exquisite one-off of deliciousness. In addition to cinnamon, it's got other components associated with love and/or St. Valentine's Day and/or simply brilliant flaming redness: rose petals, rose hips, the teeniest, tiniest smidgeon of tart apple (almost an apple blossom flavor, rather than the standard baked & sweetened apple one), hibiscus, and a touch of dark and snappy licorice root (again, not really the dessert kind). Whoever put this blend together was an absolute genius, and I'd love to know what other Bigelow teas they created - I'm not too terribly fond of a lot of Bigelow teas (or maybe it's just that they're kind of weak by the time they're purchased by me at the grocery store), but this, like I keep saying, is a totally mind-blowingly wonderful brew. One of the coolest things about it is its color - a transparent flaming fire-engine red that's especially impressive in a clear mug. It's so bright, it almost looks like a beverage an alien would be sipping in a sci-fi bar, but it's 100% natural! The flavor, too, is unusual - not the standard apples 'n' cinnamon sort of flavor, it's got more of a, well, SPICY, red hot sort of thing going on, with amazing floral/big red rose undertones. Anyway, just try it. I'm going to order some right now, and if it's discontinued, I'll cry.

review/text: I opened my first pack of Leonidas chocolate to find them completely melted. I thought for certain I was out $40. I skeptically emailed the company through the amazon provided link expecting never to hear back. Not only did I hear back by later that evening, but the next day I had a new package of chocolate in Perfect Condition with no additonal charge. The Chocolate in and of itself is great, but I believe that good customer service, especially in this day and age, should be commended. I would highly recommend both the Chocolate and the company and will be doing business with them again.

review/summary: Good, but...
review/text: ... not $54 + $12 shipping good.<br /><br />I haven't tasted these in 25 years. My French boss used to bring back a box or two whenever she came back from Europe, and back then I thought they were the best thing I'd ever put in my mouth. Imagine how pleased I was when I discovered they were available through Amazon!<br /><br />Well, a lot has changed since then. The filling texture seems margarine-y to me (somewhat like whipped Crisco) rather than the creamy, melt-in-your-mouth goodness I remember. Also, the flavor seems less pronounced, and the hazelnuts are definitely not as fresh and crunchy as they once were.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, or perhaps this is a shipping version of the recipe, better suited to handle temperature swings and rough handling. Whatever the reason, I wouldn't pay $66 for 1.5 lb box again; $25-30 seems about right.

review/summary: Fantastic Coffee Cream White Chocolates!!!
review/text: This is by far the best white chocolate out there! Coffee-cream center is soft and melts in your mouth but is not nauseatingly sweet like some other types of fillings. Outside white chocolate is sweet and vanilla-flavored but does not overwhelm the senses as you bite down into the chocolate. I don't know how Leonidas does it - crispy white chocolate outside but soft and buttery inside! You hear a soft crunch as you bite into the white chocolate but the coffee cream just gives in without any resistance and begins to melt in your mouth! I don't know if it's the coffee in the butter cream or not but you will get a high that just makes you feel really happy! This tastes like crispy vanilla chocolate on the outside with coffee butter pudding on the inside! Very sensual and hits the taste buds just right!

review/text: Leonidas, if not the best, is surely near the top of the world's best chocolates.  OK so maybe some niche market limited production chocolate is better, but hey what we can buy from Amazon this chocolate is really good.  Great pains are taken to ensure the package arrives with its delicate cargo intact.  They are packaged in styro-foam insulating boxes inside cardboard boxes.  I think they are shipped 1 day delivery, but if it is hot, the chocolates may arrive slightly deformed.  This did not detract from the taste.  Although for the cost, I would have expected a little better insurance that they would show up immaculately presentable.<br />Overall fabulous chocolate, very quick delivery.

review/text: I know some people will say "aw you just don't know nothing about chocolate" or "aw you didn't major in chocolate in college" or "aw you and Stalin have the same taste in chocolate so who will listen to you" but believe it or not I did not find these great or worth bragging on.  I loved the dark chocolate and the milk I had before from Leonidas and I finished them in a day.  These I found to be rather bland and after eating a couple I was ready to give them up and eat something else.  I found them really enjoyable though with a nice hot cup of coffee.  With the taste in mind I even let my wife taste and she agreed that these are not of the same taste quality as what we had before.  I think some people will eat these and love them and think they are great but they are just not for me.  Its kind of like when my brother use to eat ketchup sandwiches and loved them so I decided to try it and the taste just wasn't for me and in fact was quite terrible.  I am not a trying to be a jerk but I find that a lot of people have a hard time believing that we all don't have the same taste but I hope if they struggle with my review they will seek help and counseling and come to an understanding.

In the future, I think I'll stick with their Milk Chocolate or Dark Chocolate assortments.

review/text: My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them.<br /><br />But I needn't have worried, they loved it! The Tuna Too Cool is a rich-looking, reddish pate with lots of jelly on top and my twosome were wolfing their portions down and got into a bit of a scuffle over the last couple of mouthfuls. They have no higher praise.

review/text: I learned recently that cats are not supposed to have GRAINS in their food. It causes them health problems, including weight problems. The first few days of trying this I couldn't decide if they were liking it or not. They had always eaten dry food. After a few days on this canned they really started to show that they were liking it. It is a little chunky, but the chunks are easily smoothed out - it's also better to add some warm water with this to make it a little soupy. If it has been refrigerated, let it get to room temperature. All 3 cats like this as well as the Tuna Too Cool and the one that has Shrimp and Chicken combined - but they didn't like salmon.

review/summary: Please understand what it means to go grain free.....
review/text: This product is a good product and really good health wise for your cats. If you are looking at this product you are probably interested in feeding your cats something better. I just wanted to address some of the negative reviews of this food - many of them by people who don't understand that all cat food is not the same. I took the time to switch my 8 year old street rescue Louie to grain-free food (tried many brands before I arrived at BFF), and here are some of my observations.<br /><br />Cost<br />All grain free foods costs more for the same reason that grass-fed antibiotic free, free range chicken costs more per lb than a chicken nugget. It's better for your cat! Anyone who has a cat that's on a farm - ever see it eating some of the corn or wheat that spills off of the truck? Never! That is because cats don't eat grains. In cheap cat foods these grains are used as fillers to round out the portions and are not of any nutritional value to the cat. When I went grain free my cat ate much, much less - thereby negating the price difference. I even tested it a couple of times - my 13 lb cat can eat 2 - 3 ounce cans of Fancy Feast in one sitting - but cannot eat a 3.3 ounce can of BFF in one sitting.<br /><br />Another point on cost. If you are the type to take your cat to the vet and take care of it when it is sick, then you save so much money and trouble with foods like this it is crazy. When you hear people talk about diabetic cats, food allergies and all the other assorted sicknesses our animals are getting - most of them come from food. Diabetic cats - did they continuously raid the cookie jar? All the money you think you will save (but are not actually saving) will go to the health care of your pet in later years. Its the same way McDonalds and Denny's don't have to absorb the cost of all the diabetics they helped create - the taxpayers pay for it through Medicare and higher insurance costs 30 or so years down the line (and sooner with all the young diabetics we are creating).<br /><br />Smell<br />Most grain free cat foods smell. EVO stank up the house horribly and I had to move the cat bowl from the kitchen. Minus all the fillers and grains - you are getting an all natural product that is better for your cat because nutrition of the cat is put first.<br /><br />Taste<br />Cat's are notoriously finicky. Most cat foods that have grains and other filler ingredients have to add heavy syrupy mixes to get the cats to eat them. They take corn, wheat, soy, barley and gods know what else, add some vitamins and then add a extremely strong tasty syrupy mix to get the cat to swallow it all. So cats fed this for a period of time get used to it the same way babies get used to sugars in their formula. Then, when you want to give the baby vegetables with no sugar added guess what? Baby rejects them - they want the sugar! Same happens with cats fed with cheap filler foods.<br /><br />Poop<br />When switching to grain free a cats habits and consistency may change. Their digestive system is learning how to digest what it was actually made for. Same thing happens to humans - look up the "Whole 30" and see what I mean.<br /><br />Switching to Grain Free<br />Its a process more involved than opening the can and plopping it down. Took me months. Google can help you do it but don't expect to just give this to your cat and have her dive right in thanking you for it. That may happen, but more likely than not you have to mix old and new foods until they are used to it.<br /><br />BFF, EVO, Taste of the Wild.... they are all good brands that will improve the health of your cat. I settled on BFF as my wet food because he loves it. I used to give him EVO wet food and he would eat it but he hated it. I still feed him EVO dry food because he likes it. I tried many brands and did not give up on grain-free food because I cared about my cat. I understood as a street cat for years he was used to eating whatever he could and it all was the cheapest, unhealthiest stuff available given to him by well meaning people. He has improved in every way (coat, activity level, temperament, litter habits, etc..) and now is a healthy and happy cat.

review/summary: Great grain free, high fiber, high moisture food!
review/text: My slightly aging cat has had horrible colitis in the last two years, and was defecating on the floor and my bed. The best solution I found was to switch to a grain free food, and offer more wet food than dry, so he will have more moisture in his bowels. I switched to Natural Care LDT, and it solved his problem...for about six months. After finding another steaming pile in my bed recently, and a few under my desk, I decided to try BFF, as my local pet store  just started carrying it. He is a picky feline, but he sucked the Tuna and pumpkin flavor down like a Hoover. One week later, happy cat, no more poop in my bed, which means happy girl. Great ingredients, and picky cat loves it!<br />Note: yes he saw the vet. The change in diet was the vets idea.

review/text: Very good quality cat food.  Made at a human food factory with human grade ingredients.  The tuna used is the red meat from the skipjack tuna fish.  They get a variety so this is just part of their diet as I do not want to feed them tuna based foods as their primary source of protein.  Healthy and cats love this.  I try to use this brand, Tiki Cat, Weurva and then for dry food Orijen cat food.  My Himalayan cats are on a no grain, no gluten/filler diet.  This wet food in combination with the dry has led to great coats, no hair balls, good energy and solid not too stinky poo :)

review/summary: OMG, it was like TT "totally tasty" - (in the cat's own words)
review/text: IDK where my BFF mom found this delicious snack, but I have to say TY!  Best Feline Friend is dose of rich, ambrosial comfort food.  Mini chunks of tender tuna punctuate the smooth tasty sauce.  Costing just over $10 per 12 pack, Best Feline Friend is a reasonable value.  At that price, this delectable entr&eacute;e is likely to become a staple of my diet.  I heart &lt;3 BFF!<br /><br />ttfn<br />Steve the cat

review/summary: Great Food
review/text: I initially thought this was a generic brand of food and of poor quality, due to the label design.  However, it's a Weruva product and is exactly the quality of food I normally purchase (Tiki Cat, Merrick, Natural Balance, Wellness).  There's no grains or byproducts.  My kitties love this and are incredibly picky eaters.  I'm going to try the other flavors now, especially at such a great price!!!

review/summary: Great for our discriminating feline friends
review/text: Our cats love this food. One of them is elderly  and doesn't normally eat enough---but she pays attention when we open one of these cans. She is doing very well on it. Our kitten, though, is now spoiled rotten and doesn't want anything else! They both like it better than canned tuna, which is saying a lot. They also really like the "tuna so cool" flavor. The one flavor they weren't crazy about was the tuna and vegetables, big surprise.

review/summary: Another Hit From BFF!
review/text: I just tried my two four footed food critics on BFF's Tuna & Veggies Valentine and it made a big hit with both of them. It's always a risk trying a new food on my two finicky cats, but I hoped they would like this one because they love parent company Weruva's Tuna & Vegetables <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70O2">Weruva Mediterranean Harvest Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 24)</a>. BFF's tuna & veggies is a bit different from Weruva's - it has red tuna instead of white and a slightly thicker consistency, though both are stew like and have visible chunks of veggies. And both have an ingredient list that meets my standards - no by products. My twosome snarfed up every last bit of tuna and veggies valentine that I gave them and they asked me for more - but they will have to wait until tonight for that!

review/summary: My cats love this stuff!
review/text: One of my kitties has ear allergies, so after much research I decided to put them on a grain free diet. I purchased a number of different types of can food from the pet store. They rejected a majority of it and refused to eat it. They went nuts over this canned food, so I am now a huge fan. My pet store does not keep much in stock, so I was thrilled to find it on amazon!

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I've recently switched my cats to all grain free food. (if you still feed your cats (or dogs!) with grain filled food, especially if you have had a problem with bladder or kidney stones, I implore you to look at the reviews and research of grain free food.) That being said, my ragdoll usually only eats dry food and my shorthair usually eats the wet food. Amazon delivered this to my doorstep today and I opened a can and fed it right away to see if they liked it. After taking a shower I came back out and it was ALL gone, and my ragdoll was finishing up what little was left. The cat food box says on the front that it was made in a human food facility, but I don't know much about cat food that isn't made in a human food facility. I still appreciate the fact that they are trying to say it is higher quality. I will probably be buying this brand from now on, I just wish Amazon Prime members got it in two days like usual, but it is shipped from pet food direct so :(.

review/text: My cat loves this! You are able to see the pieces of chicken & tuna! It is very fresh and I was tempted to take a bite, though I didn't of course. :)
