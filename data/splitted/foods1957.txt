review/summary: Would be perfect if it were organic
review/text: I absolutely love this tea. The warm blueberry taste makes me feel very mellow and relaxed. It's perfect during the winter. So far, it's my favorite herbal tea (though my favorite teas are true teas).<br /><br />I only wish it were organic. That would make it perfect. I'm going to search for organic blueberry teas online in hopes of finding one that tastes as good.

review/summary: Blueberry smell.. weird taste.
review/text: This tea definitely smelled like blueberries but upon tasting it, it was a very sour /bitter taste to me despite not over steeping the tea. It almost tasted like cough syrup. added a bit of organic sugar and it tasted a bit better. Maybe I Just don't like herbal / fruit flavored teas.

review/text: Ordered this tea for health purposes, since Blueberrys and Blueberry leaves are great for your health, drink it hot with honey in the morning. Compared it to other brands, this was the one with the ingedients to best suit my needs. I would suggest trying a flavor before ordering a multipack. Saves me money to order from Amazon since I drink tea all day everyday. Always receive my orders on or before date promised.

review/summary: Great Hot or Cold
review/text: Well winter is over so it is time to put the coffeemaker away and checkout the tea collections.<br /><br />Not sure if I wanted iced or hot, I was looking for something that was either and not the same old, same old.  Blueberry, now that is different, can be good either hot or cold.  Well, that worked for me since I tend to get caught up in a book and the tea turns cold before I know it.<br /><br />I do not add sugar since I like tea just the way it is.  I did find that with True Blueberry, if you steep for too long, the overall taste become bitter and a bit hard to take.<br /><br />As I have been reading, the trend now is to combine flavors and come up with you own concoction.  I am thinking that his just might work with the blueberry.  Teavana matches blueberry with a pineapple.  That could be interesting.<br /><br />Well, back to this product.  I see that there is a complaint about Soy Lecithin so off to review that issue.  Apparently, there is no real problem with this ingredient unless you are allergic to soy.  Therefore, I am here to tell those with a soy intolerance - please stay away and read tea labels prior to consumption since this is a relatively new ingredient to the Celestial Seasonings line.<br /><br />In addition, while blueberries are known for their antioxidant capabilities it has not been proven that all the health benefits associated with blueberries are equally present when the blueberries are consumed in tea. So with that being said, Celestial Seasoning True Blueberry tastes great and if you just happen to get an extra dose of antioxidants, well, the more the better.

review/summary: Just what I wanted and with extreamly fast shippping!
review/text: The shipping seemed rather spendy if you are having the items shipped to the US, but considering you cannot find them here I decided to give it a try. I was blow away by how fast they arrived at my house! the estimated shipping date said they would be here between a period of a month so I was expecting it to be a while, but they came a week before the expected shipping period started!<br />  I will say, however, foreign M&M's never seem to taste exactly the same. I have tried Crispy M&M's for a variety of different countries (presents from friends) and at first was slightly dissapointed by the mild taste difference. I have gotten used that this fact and I love them now. So as long as you know there might be a slight taste difference you should still LOVE these. Just because they might not be exactly as you remembered them doesnt mean they still arnt the best M&M's ever!

review/summary: hated that these are no longer in America.  loved that they're available here through Germanshop24.
review/text: i've always loved Crispy M&M's.  in 2005 when they disappeared, i was very upset.  a few years later, i found out they were still available in Europe and Australia, and a few other places.  to this day i wonder why they won't sell them here anymore.  for a long time, i was doing research hoping they'd come back to the United States.  around early 2011 there was a rumor that they'd be back, but then the pretzel M&M's were released, as an obvious replacement.  blue bag, orange mascot.  those are good, too, but not as good as the Crispy ones were.<br /><br />i love that they're now available here through Amazon and Germanshop24.  Amazon makes a simple transaction, allowing me to purchase everything from one site.  the shipping didn't take nearly as long as expected.  i got them 10 days before the earlier estimated date.  some would say the cost is a bit much, especially since shipping costs a little less than the item itself.  considering that i haven't had these in 7 years and they were my favorite kind of M&M's when they were here, i think it's worth getting a bag every now and then.  it's cheaper than going to Germany or Australia and getting them there.  as an occasional treat, i'll enjoy having these be available.<br /><br />they taste better than i remembered.  i believe anyone who loved Crispy M&M's before they were removed from America and lives here will find it to be worth the price.  i also believe anyone who hasn't tried these is missing out on something really great.  i'd say this bag is the perfect size for its price.  i've seen slightly bigger ones on other sites with twice the shipping cost.  308 grams with 17 dollar shipping?  i don't think so.  i'd rather get these here.  less hassle and much cheaper to ship, even considering the increase in weight for the larger bag.<br /><br />my only truly negative comment on this is that the picture makes it look like a huge bag and i'm horrible at the Metric system, so i was expecting a bigger bag.  it's still a decent side, but there should be a ratio to American measurements somewhere in the description for those of us who can't convert stuff to Metric.  i'm more at fault, for i judged it by appearance rather than researching it, finding a unit converter online, etc. however, i'm sure many people will make a similar miscalculation.<br /><br />in all, i love that this product is here.  because of the price to import it, it won't be something i get very often, but it's definitely worth an occasional addition.  i love the idea of having these as a treat.  every once in a while, i'll add it to my other purchases, whether it's a special occasion or simply a craving for one of the most brilliant confectioneries i've had in my lifetime.

review/summary: Not entirely what I expected
review/text: Back in the day, when they were still available in the United States, Crispy M&Ms were my favorite M&Ms.  So you can imagine my excitement, when researching Crispy M&Ms online to see if they might make a comeback in the US, when I discovered that I could buy them NOW from a German company on Amazon.  So I placed an order and they arrived.  Well, while they are Crispy M&Ms, they don't taste as good as I remember them.  Maybe it's my memory or maybe the chocolate is different in Germany.  They tasted more like malted milk balls in an M&M shell.<br /><br />On a side note, if you purchase this item, you might experience a delay in shipping like I did because you have to sign for them in order to take delivery.  They arrived via USPS who left me a card to sign.  I signed the card and my carrier left them two days later.

review/summary: Good Heavens!  Good Water!
review/text: Where I live the water tastes absolutely horrendous! It amazes me how some people drink it, make coffee, tea, and cook with it! I used to buy a nationally known brand of spring water. Then I read about its D rating. Fortunately for me, someone recommended Penta water. I did not have to look far. Sure enough, there it was on Amazon! I was so happy to receive it. Penta water had me at the first sip! Number one:  the bottle is BPA free. Number two: the water itself is free of the nasties found in most drinking water. As far as Penta is concerned I say, "Here's to delicious drinking water and to a delicious cup of tea or coffee!"

review/summary: Perfect Water
review/text: My uncle from San Diego actually introduced this to me several years ago, but living in Washington state, with delicious water, I wasn't too concerned.  After going on many getaways, however, and having to face disgusting water at various locations, I realized that this was the best option for delicious portable water.  It is taste free and (if this makes any sense) has a light feel with absolutely no aftertaste.  I am not a fan of Aquafina or many other brands of bottled water because they haven't been filtered in any way, this has every impurity removed.  I realize that it is expensive for water, so I wouldn't buy this for daily consumption, but it is the best option for when we need water on the go and can't make use of refillable containers. Also, it is comforting to know that Penta is so confident with their water and process it that they have patented it (it takes 11 hours to filter their water in order to remove every element of trace pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other things which make water less than ideal).

review/text: From Their Website:<br />"At the end of day, is water just water?<br /><br />You may think so, but not when it comes to Penta - Ultra-Purified Water.<br /><br />Founded in 1999 in San Diego, California, we created the Penta Water Company, Inc. with a mission to make a refreshing difference in the purity of water, and thus, in the quality of life. It inspired us to become like fine wine connoisseurs, where we could taste, discern, and feel the difference that Penta awakened in us. When we introduced it to the world, it was love at first sip and the rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />Today, PENTA water is available in more than 3,500 stores nationwide and the love for it continues to grow with many more stores being added monthly. Penta is also sold internationally, including in Australia, Canada, and Japan.<br /><br />Unlike many supplements and beverages that use synthetic additives, Penta has no additives so it is naturally and fully absorbed by your body to maximize its antioxidant effects. Oh, and did we also mention that our water is proven be the purest around? After all, not all waters are created equal.<br /><br />So you see, at the end of your day, at the beginning of your day, and in the middle of your day, the type of beverage and the kind of water you drink really matters.<br /><br />Penta is for the nourishment of your mind, body, and soul. It goes beyond hydration to become a way of life, a choice to fully embrace a vital, healthful life...today and tomorrow.<br /><br />Zero Additives. Ultra-purified Water. Now that's refreshing!<br /><br />PENTA, Live PURE."<br /><br />***I've personally been enjoying the amazing Penta Water since it became available to me locally in 1999.  It absolutely re-hydrates me, leaving me feeling energized, refreshed and renewed.  I drink Penta everyday with my dietary supplements (It's especially effective with a 5-Hour Energy Shot).  Thanks Amazon, for these excellent prices too.***

One of the best curries I have ever had, made in my own kitchen!  Seriously, it is amazing.  However the pricing from this particular seller is quite high.  This same product was only $2.49 and I did not get gouged an exorbitant additional $5 for shipping.  Not a good deal, but a very good product.

review/text: This curry is pretty good as food goes, which is to say it is better than most fast foods and the sort. But it is not quite up to the mark for an Indian curry. I find Parampara's Tikka Masala curry to be much better flavored than this one. Despite having the "butter" label, it did not taste particularly rich or buttery, actually the Tikka Masala curry tasted butterier than this one. The flavor is nice but not the best that I have eaten. Also, I missed much of the aroma that I associate with Indian food and felt the lack of spices somewhat. Overall, not bad, but definitely not the best.

Making any size of drink other than a small six-ounce cup results in the K-Cup overfilling and spilling out of the unsealed lid, resulting in hot water and tea leaf bits all over the inside of my Keurig - and in my tea.<br /><br />I thought this might be a manufacturing defect limited to one box, but K-Cups from two of the three boxes delivered by Amazon, as well as K-Cups from a box of the same type from the grocery store, all had this defect.<br /><br />I would not purchase the Twinings brand of K-Cups again.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/16/12: DH went to the grocery store unsupervised and bought another box. Every cup in the box still suffers from the same problem.

review/summary: OK tea on demand
review/text: If ou don't have the patience or care how your tea tastes, these capsules will work fine.  However, you can get the same effect by putting a tea bag in your Keurig.  PG Tips bags make a nice stout cup even in a Keurig.  Me?  I favor boiling water and steeping for five minutes in a pot.  Wife and son are fine with the Keurig brew.

review/summary: Great for Hot or Iced Tea
review/text: I've tried a number of tea brands in my Keurig, and the Twinings English Breakfast tea by far provides the best flavor for a black tea. The tea has a very mild citrus flavor and has a smooth less bitter finish than many other teas. I drink several glasses of iced tea and the twinings k-cups are perfect for brewing over a glass of ice. I add sugar or artificial sweetener to the glass before brewing which makes it dissolve faster. Simply great tea.

review/text: After drinking this tea and using the cups for last month I actually really like the tea and the cups burst only if I try to use them again. If the cup is used only once, no problems.  I'd suggest these kcups to fellow tea drinkers, just buy at a good price knowing you'll only use them once.

review/summary: Excellent all-natural muffin mix!
review/text: I recently picked up a package of this muffin mix at my local grocery store because I wanted bran muffins that didn't have any partially hydrogenated oils or preservatives.  I was very impressed by the all-natural ingredients in this mix, and now that I've made the muffins and tasted them, I am totally hooked.<br /><br />Here is the list of ingredients on the box: whole grain stone-ground whole wheat flour, unbleached and unenriched white flour, brown sugar, wheat bran, molasses (soy lethicin), leavening (GDL, baking soda), wheat starch, salt.<br /><br />That's it!!!  You just have to add 1 Tablespoon of butter or vegetable oil, 1/2 cup of milk, and 1 egg to the mix and let it sit for 10 minutes before baking it.  The muffins end up fluffy but grainy with a little crunch, which is great.<br /><br />Oh, and the box the mix comes in is made with 100% recycled paperboard.  So when you buy this you can be health conscious and environmentally responsible at the same time!  :D

review/summary: Bran Muffins
review/text: Hodgson Mills has the best flour and mixes around.  I only use their products for baking.  The bran muffins I make I use a combination of Bran and Wheat flour.  Adding raisins, blueberries, mixed frozen fruit and dates, sometimes chopped plums makes an irresistable muffin that my husband and I love.  They are his snack at work.  Most of the time they are my breakfast as I use the jumbo size muffin pans.  Great stuff!

review/summary: Healthy Bran Muffins
review/text: Other than making bran muffins from scratch this mix is a quality healthful product.  It has whole grain stone ground whole wheat flour and wheat bran among other ingredients.  The muffins came out a little dryer than I expected compared to previous purchases of this mix in local stores so I added raisins for the next batch.  My husband likes the dryer texture but I don't.  I will experiment and add more moisture to the mix.  This product was hard to find anywhere locally.  I used to buy it at Kroger or Tom Thumb but suddenly it disappeared from local stores' offerings.  Amazon delivery was quick and the price was excellent.

review/summary: Perfect Muffin Mix
review/text: These come out moist and delicious. They are versatile, and you can easily add shredded carrots or raisins, etc for variety, or top with flax seed or wheat germ. They aren't overly sweet, just right. The mix makes preparing them a breeze, and I love that the box makes only a half dozen - just the right amount for me and my daughter to eat in a day or two since my husband is scared of bran! The ingredients are all natural (although I wish they were organic too!). Try using coconut oil for your vegi oil when you make them, you will be pleased with the hint of extra sweetness.

review/text: I eat a bran muffin for breakfast every day. I normally make a batch from scratch every sunday. I decided to give this mix a try since I use Hodgeson Mill wheat bran in my recipe. I followed the recipe to the tee, but the taste was a bit off. I tried again a few days later adding a bit of honey and all natural vanilla extract. Still, the muffins tasted a bit sour to me. I guess I will just go back to Grandmas Recipe.

review/summary: Wonderful stuff!
review/text: well since almost 2 years now,...NO more colds computer-eye strain and tiredness since me and my wife have been taking this great tasting product! My memory has improved also, I used to forget things unless I wrote them down, now I don't have to do that anymore, I just remember so clearly! And we are having this stuff literally every day in our early morning breakfast shake. we are 2 busy people who have not much time making a big breakfast, so our first meal is always just a protein shake with raw organic almond-milk with either bananas/ strawberries or blueberries.<br /><br />The reason for most of the Goji Berries health benefits is the fact that these berries have a very high level of antioxidants, as well as relatively high levels of some important vitamins and minerals. the main reason we wanted to take this because we hurt that Goji Berries contain 19 amino acids--the building blocks of protein--including all eight essential for life of the human body - no other plant can make that claim!<br /><br />we sure are hooked on this and most likely will never get of the amazon auto-ship program..this is well worth the money!

review/summary: Absolute garbage, save your money
review/text: This Goji powder, I don't know... I feel like it was super heavily processed or something, and stripped out the life force and nutrition out of the Goji Berries.  I DO like Goji berries.  I think they're a powerful food.  But this powder is just complete garbage.  I noticed absolutely no benefit in taking it.  Not only that, it doesn't even taste like Goji.  It tastes odd, mixes weird, looks weird.<br /><br />I'd steer clear of this supplement.  Your money is better spent elsewhere. Maybe on some actual goji berries.<br /><br />How this review got 5 of 10 helpful votes is beyond me! What do I have to gain by writing a biased review? Some of you people rating these things are bonkers.

review/text: I put off buying this brand for quite a while. But am glad I finally went for it. To me 3 spoonfuls don't bring out the chocolate enough, so I use 4 or 5. This has great flavor and there are almost no chocolate clumps left after stirring! The flavor is nice and mild (not too sweet). I will definitely buy this again. But am I the only one who thinks the lid and freshness seal are stubborn? I am on can #4 and have had to cut the seal with a knife on 3. I also decided to keep the lid open slightly because opening it at first hurt my fingers. That is my only gripe.

review/text: I was pretty pleased when I tried this item after a recent food service show. There is a very strong chocolate smell and taste. One bar has 150 calories (30 from fat) and 9 grams of sugar (versus 16 in the old Cocoa puffs cereal and milk bars). The texture is different, it looks more like cocoa krispies than puffs and my jaw hurt from chewing so much but overall it is a nice option for people (especially kids) who don't have time to have a sit-down breakfast in the morning.

But, if you read on the seasonal mix, the delectable medley is only sweet potato & taro.  There are several colors of sticks makig you think you're getting several different vegetables, but actually you're getting the same two vegetables, w/some dyed by beet juice.  Disappointing.

review/summary: Misleading Description
review/text: I have no problem at all with the actual product, however if you will notice in the description, it states a "case of 6". And the picture is not large enough to see that the box quantity is only 12, not the normal 18. So you only receive 72 K-Cups, rather that 96. I was expecting the larger boxes. Shame on me for not asking, and shame on them for not stating it in the description.

review/summary: GREAT Holiday Gift!!!!
review/text: I recently tried these cookies and breads and found them to be delicious!! I myself am a baker and consider myself to be a little bit of a cookie snob. I have high expectations on baked goods and was not disappointed with these yummy treats. I found all the goodies in the tower to be very flavorful and could not get over how moist the breads were. My family also loved them and really enjoyed the variety of cookies and breads that come with the tower. There is something for everyone. I will definitely be purchasing more from this bakery in the future and excited to purchase these for great holiday gifts!!

It's just nicely sweet with a great deep texture.<br /><br />Put in the fridge... magic.

review/summary: Fabulous Drink to restore electrolytes
review/text: When it is hot outside and you need to drink more than just water, Recharge is great!  Not only does it restore the electrolyte balance perfectly along with other vitamins, it does it without added sugar.  It is sweetened with Stevia, which is an herb that is actually good for you.  This is so much better than Gatorade which has way too much sodium and chemicals along with sugar in it.  Also Recharge is very convenient in the little sticks that can be added to a bottle of water and it tastes so good, too.  It comes in grape, orange, lemonade, and tropical punch.  Try it.  You will be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: MarketSpice is as good as the reviews
review/text: I lived in Seattle for almost 20 years.  However, in all that time, and even going down to the Pike Place Market at least 2 or 3 times a year (we lived far east of town), I never "knowingly" drank MarketSpice Tea.  However, we moved to North Carolina and "discovered" this wonderful drink.  We also became avid tea drinkers.  A good part of that conversion, was due to MarketSpice Tea.<br /><br />The flavors are spicey, pungent, smack you up side the head intense.  If you like Lipton, you won't like this.  We use the loose tea only.  Yes, it's a little more of a hassle compared to tea bags, but worth it due to the freshness, flavor, etc.<br /><br />Also, until the our last purchase, which was from Amazon, we always ordered from MarketSpice themselves.  They're great people, they always shipped what I wanted, etc.  I'll never buy from them directly again.  They don't want to move into the 21st Century when it concerns automation and I respect that.  However, I have.  Amazon gives me the capability to do both; order my favorite tea and do so online, with a company that remembers my address, credit card, etc.<br /><br />I can wholeheartdly recommend this product and ordering through Amazon.  If you like tea, you owe it to yourself to try this product.

Because I live in the midwest, I was happy to see that MarketSpice tea can now be purchased at Amazon.com.  If you like a great, hearty tea, full of character, I recommend you try MarketSpice.  One whiff while it is brewing will convince you that here is an exceptional tea. Once you have tasted MarketSpice it will be hard to settle for any tea that doesn't have the great taste of MarketSpice.

review/summary: Sweet & Exiting
review/text: This tea has a lot to offer to cheer you up at the end of a day's hard work. It is a strong tea but also sweet and exiting. Most peculiar is that it becomes better from the first cup to the last as you finish the pot. Even when you leave half a pot to turn stone cold it is good to drink. Thus, served hot or as ice tea, MarketSpice is an exiting drink. Furthermore, it has a refreshing and sweet taste. No suger or honey should be added. This makes it a great tea for those who are on a diet as well.

When I drink this tea, I am home again. This tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of Seattle in one cup.<br /><br />This is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors. You can sweeten this more if you like with Stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness. It is good with a touch of Muscovado Sugar from India Tree.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: We spent a few days in Seattle and in the Pike market there was a great little herb, spice and tea shop - Marketspice.  We drink tea every morning and were captivated by their signature black tea, with a natural orange flavor.  Back at home, we found it it be a wonderful blend, slightly sweet and very aromatic. When we ran out, we really wanted to get some more and found that it is offered by mail through Amazon. Now we have a source to keep us stocked up.<br />By the way, it has a concentrated flavor for our taste, so we mix it 1/1 with our favorite black tea from a local supplier.

review/summary: Warm, delicious and long lasting!
review/text: Market Spice Tea is my favorite tea.  Each sip is smooth and sparkly, invigorating and contemplative.  It floats across your tongue and then kicks each taste bud into attention.  A simplified description is a highly caffeinated smooth black tea with cinnamon and orange spices.  It is important to keep this tea in glass jar to keep fresh. I recommend 3 spoons to 4 cups of water and steep for 3-4 minutes only.<br /><br />This tea gives you a smooth "high" that is just as strong but longer lasting than coffee.  So if you are sensitive to caffeine, limit your intake in the evening.  It's perfect for sharing with friends (which is what I do with the 1 lb. bags).

review/summary: Think you don't like tea?
review/text: Market Spice Tea is the name of the signature blend and the tea company that has been producing it since the early 1900's in Pike Place Market in Seattle. It is black tea flavored with cinnamon, orange peel and essential oils. It is naturally sweet but contains no sugar or sweetener.<br /><br />Many people who don't like tea, love it. It is very fragrant and is great hot or iced. If you are used to drinking black tea with no flavor or sweetener you may prefer to blend it with a plain black tea as it is a very strongly flavored tea. Taste it before sweetening it.<br /><br />You should buy it in small quantities because it contains no preservatives and the citrus oils can go "off" after six months or so. You should also make sure not to store it or serve it in plastic or styrofoam as the citrus oils react with them.

I could generally take it or leave it.<br /><br />Now no day is complete without my beloved MST.  I began with bags, which are amazing.  I upped it to loose tea pound bags and have become a total tea person.  I do believe I will branch out this time and order some rooibos and green versions--may as well make the shipping charge worth the time.<br /><br />I can't say enough about this sweet, spicy stuff.  It needs nothing but one enormous cup because a little one just won't do.  Prepare to become addicted.  Oh, and I've lost a lot of weight, too, because I no longer drink coffee with creamers and truly have no sweet cravings anymore.  If that doesn't justify buying it by the pound, nothing will!  Enjoy this amazing brew!  And share it with a friend!

I like to steep it for 10+ min., (sometimes I forget about the timer)and add sugar and skim milk, so you can see I'm no tea purest. The drawback is the S&H charge for 1# is $7 ( just recently up from $6; guess that wasn't high enough!) However the same charge of $7 is also for 2#, 3# or 4# (then up to $9,for some reason for 5#). So buy 4# and put what you won't use in 6 months in the freezer

It's impossible to over-brew this tea, some black teas can turn bitter if brewed too long but somehow with the cinnamon/orange mixed in with the tea it doesn't seem to happen.  Add a bit of vanilla coffee creamer to really make this shine.

review/text: A friend of mine recently brought some of this back with her from Seattle. She knew I'd love it, since I'm on a constant search for tea that does not taste like "tea".<br /><br />This stuff has an amazing kick. I can't get enough of it. It almost tastes like liquid candy, but without the sugar. As soon as I heard it was available on Amazon, I ordered 2 pounds.<br /><br />I was speaking to another friend, who's from Seattle, and told her I found this amazing tea. Before I could finish, she said "Marketspice?" She grew up on the stuff, and hadn't had any in years until I brought some over. She was in heaven.
