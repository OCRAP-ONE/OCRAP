review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I thought for sure I was going to love this tea. I love licorice and I like my teas sweet. I was so disappointed in the flavor of this product! It has very little licorice taste and an almost sickening after taste and smell. I added sugar to it as I did not find it very sweet. I ordered the 6 box pack of this so I guess I have 5 boxes of it to give away

review/summary: Licorice Lovers--You must check this out!
review/text: Those of you who love licorice or anise flavor and who happen to be tea-drinkers, rejoice! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic. The anise/licorice flavor is intense. The tea is relatively sweet, so in my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary, but you may want to add a little honey to it. This is not a wimpy tea, but full bodied and the longer you steep it, the stronger it gets.

review/summary: Delicious and soothing
review/text: I first tried this tea 4 years ago when a friend introduced it to me at work.  I was able to buy it at Trader Joes but they discontinued stocking it in my local store about a year ago.  I then found this online directly from Stash and bought boxes at a time.  I am a person who finds it hard to drink water but this herb tea helps me drink up to 10 huge mugs of it a day. Lemon and ginger combination is perfect to satisfy the need for sweet with a little bite at the end with the ginger. It has also helped me stop drinking caffeine drinks which lets me now sleep at night.  I will continue to buy this and recommend it highly.

review/summary: Tried it...loved it...now my favorite herbal tea
review/text: Based on the other review, I went and tried this tea.  As a choir member, I am always interested in licorice products since they soothe a worn voice.  However, many of the teas I have tried have too much ginger in it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this tea.<br /><br />1) The licorice taste is subtle, but definitely present.<br /><br />2) No sugar necessary.  As a dentist, I love this.  The licorice flavor doesn't jump out at you at first, but around 4 or 5 seconds after swallowing, the licorice "dances" around the sides of your tongue.  I don't know how else to describe it, but it really does dance.  I've never had that before.  Brilliant!<br /><br />3) It's best when over-steeped - like 10 minutes.<br /><br />4) Most grocery stores I've been to carry this, so it's readily available should you find yourself staring at an empty box early in the evening.

review/summary: Basic Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea
review/text: ***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, and full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***

review/summary: Rather weak and non-descript tea
review/text: There are several other Stash teas that I've tried and enjoyed. But this one is sort of feeble-tasting.  Up until now, I've gotten the Yogi Tea Egyptian Licorice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QL6">Yogi Tea Organic Egyptian Licorice, Tea Bags, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>and that one actually has a bold licorice taste.  And it is that one that is serving as the point of comparison to this Stash tea.  Keep in mind that I don't add honey or any sweetner to my teas, so they have to stand on their own.  This Stash Licorice Spice has a weak licorice taste and a weak spice taste.  I have to use TWO teabags at a time (which makes the seemingly low price not so much a good deal).

review/summary: Subtle, Mild Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for over 35 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Fruit-Flavoured Tea
review/text: Stash is a very good quality, full-bodied tea and I am a big-time tea drinker.  I have been drinking tea since probably before Superman was born.  I like to keep a bunch of different flavoured teas around, especially some fruity flavours.  I call them dessert teas because I usually don't eat dessert, but I like to have a fruit tea after dinner.  Stash tea bags are usually, if not always, individually sealed in a foil-type packet, so the flavour stays fresh for a long time.<br /><br />The acai berry flavor is delicious!  It has a nice natural sweetness and a very fruity taste.  It is very smooth and is a caffeine free herbal tea.  The 100% natural ingredients, listed in this order, are: hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, orange peel, chicory root, blackberry flavor, blackcurrant flavor, acai flavor, acai fruit powder, and licorice powder.  Contains soy.

Licorice root can raise blood pressure. I don't have either condition, but after finding that out, decided that this was better as an occasional treat (as opposed to a daily ritual.)

review/text: I never liked the flavor of this tea initially, and had a box sitting in the back of my cupboard for over a year, until I discovered its use as a home remedy.  It is soothing to the throat and digestive system, and contains natural expectorants and antispasmodics.  As such, I've found it to be a great reliever for coughs, cold or allergy symptoms such as congestion and sneezing, and even painful periods. Today I swear by this stuff and always have to have a box around for sickness. I've thrown away all my cold medicines and cough syrups, the natural herbs in this tea are better for you and almost as effective without the side effects of drowsiness or confusion. Not a doctor, just a happy customer.

It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****

It would be great served alone, after dinner, or with a piece of good quality cheesecake.  Although I am drinking it warm, it would likely taste great as an ice tea, too.<br /><br />If you want to sweeten it, I suggest natural brown sugar, honey, or agave cactus juice (natural food isle in supermarket).  For this one, I used 2 bags for 24 oz hot water.<br /><br />As with all Stash teas, each bag is sealed in its own foil pouch to protect its delicate flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients, in order listed, are: hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, yumberry flavor, chicory root, blackcurrant flavor, blackcurrant powder, and licorice powder.

It's neither strong nor bland, just floral and pleasant. Reminds me slightly of chrysanthemum. It doesn't make me sleepy or keep me up, for what it's worth. I had some primo stuff at a local coffeeshop that tasted much like the Stash brand, but had an awesome citrusy floral aroma; been wanting to find something like that for a while, and so far this Stash Chamomile comes closest.

review/summary: Tatsteh Tea
review/text: This tea is really tasty...I wasn't even a tea person until tasting this, and once I did, I was hooked. The flavor is light and super-refreshing but you can still taste and smell the mint. The only reason why I took off one star is because I tend to like things that taste strongly, and this one is a little bit delicate for me. To remedy that, I either steep it with hibiscus or black tea, or I steep it at double strength and all is well.<br />Putting it with honey and stevia also tastes great, and makes me feel better when I have colds. I love this tea!

review/summary: The freshest, fights edema!
review/text: This is the first camomile tea that actually maintains the most of the medicinal properties of camomile!! So far it is the best out of five different brands we got to try in USA including various organic, so called farmaceutic quality, etc.. To give a specific example of this tea's well-preserved qualities: it really helps us get rid of extra water in our bodies, nearly as good as "water pills"  doctors recommend. One packet in a small cup does great.. And can be repeated if you need.  We have subscribed to receive it from Amazon on a regular basis - the price is better then in a supermarket.

review/summary: Absolutely the best tea I've ever had
review/text: I'm not a big tea drinker. I keep buying different types of tea convinced I'll like them, and each one turns out to be completely different than I anticipated. In other words, I think all teas taste generally the same: like hot water. Even with sugar - then they taste like hot water with sugar. But this tea is completely different.<br /><br />I love licorice. This tastes exactly like licorice. It smells like licorice (clearly from the anise, since licorice root basically smells like cooked bark). It doesn't need sugar. It's sweet. It has an 'aftertaste' of licorice. In other words, it's perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately no store I've ever been to has carried it, although I look EVERY TIME I walk down the tea aisle. Even if they did, it wouldn't be that awesome, since this is pretty much the same exact price it would go for in, say, Target. Unfortunately it is 6 boxes...but I really don't think you can have enough of this stuff.<br /><br />After some trial-and-error, I can now say that, of the few other licorice teas that do exist, nothing really comes close to Stash. I've tried a weird Celestial tea  mix of  licorice root + 3 other things (tastes like hot water), Batavia Anise tea (hot water with a licorice aroma), and store brand Albrecht Heijn Zoethout tea (from the Netherlands - smells like hot bark but tastes exactly like this tea. Unfortunately it's completely nonexistent here.) What I've discovered on my quest fs that only a few brands even attempt to make JUST licorice tea (it's not popular here, and it baffles me that people don't appreciate the taste), and of those only Stash is successful.<br /><br />Buy it. Amazon is a good deal and it's soooo good.

review/summary: Too much of a licorice smell and taste
review/text: Well, I understand that since it is Licorice Spice tea it would have some licorice smell and taste, but it is just too much for me. If you use 1 bag of it in your cup you are getting light yellow liquid with a very strong licorice taste and smell. I am using it in a tea pot mixing with other teas then it is working better.

review/text: We first came across the Licorice flavored tea from Stash at a local Gourmet Market. The market has several locations locally but none close to home.<br />We loved the taste of this tea specially in the cold Michigan winters. It gives a calming effect and does help sooth your throat if you are coming up with a cold or something. A great product and I am happy with the fact that we can buy it on Amazon in bulk at a very good price.<br />If you love Herbal tea do try this product from Stash it is good. Thank you for carrying this tea and thank you Stash!

review/summary: Different and Tasty
review/text: I am a tea drinker from way back and Stash is an excellent tea.  This flavor has a smooth strawberry/pomegranate taste and is delicious.  It is a red tea (red in colour) and red because its primary ingredient is Rooibos, which is red tea and is slightly sweet.  Also included (in this order) are rosehips, hibiscus flowers, raspberry leaves, citric acid, and strawberry flavour and pomegranate flavour.<br /><br />I did some research on the health benefits of some of these ingredients.  This info is what I found reported in a few different sources:<br /><br />Rooibus tea:<br />Rooibus tea is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids and is reported to have 50 times more antioxidant power than green tea. It also has other antioxidants not found in other teas.  The effect of free radicals in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the antioxidants in Rooibus tea.  Rooibus tea is completely pure and natural .  It contains no additives, preservatives or colorant.  It is strongly recommended for those suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension.  It has no caffeine and so has a soothing effect on the central nervous system.  Rooibus tea is low in tannin and so it does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.  It has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants.  It also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, hearrtburn, stomach ulcers and constipation. It supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and flouride, and it contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid. I was also told that red tea does not have ECOG, a healthful property that green tea does have. That is why I drink both red tea and green tea, to get the best of all worlds.<br /><br />Rosehips is supposed to be good for infections, bladder problems, and diarrhea and also a good source of vitamin C.<br />Hibiscus flowers is supposed to be a diuretic (fluid release) and reported to help lower high blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />If I had only two words to describe the taste of this tea, they would be fruity and smooth.  It is also caffeine free.  It is a nice change of pace from standard flavors and a nice after-dinner comfort drink.  Stash makes a good full bodied tea, stronger than some of these cheapie teas, so I find I only need one bag per a 24 oz cup. (Of course, that all depends on your preference.)  These special Stash flavors are a little hard to find because many stores do not carry them unless they have a super large tea display.<br /><br />BTW--I am not a doctor--(my disclaimer)--just someone who has done a lot of reading on alternative health care.  As with any product, consult your health cae provider, especially if you are on medications.

review/text: Stash's Cinnamon Apple Chamomile is a comforting blend of apples, hibiscus, chamomile and cinnamon. I use two teabags per cup as it gives the tea a much more full-bodied flavor. I've tasted quite a few cinnamon-apple teas and this one is my favorite. There is not too much cinnamon and just enough apple flavor. It is even more delicious when sweetened with a huckleberry honey. You will want to drink this tea while decorating for Christmas or while eating a piece of cake.

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry Delight
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: What's With the Weird Sensation Seconds After Sipping?
review/text: I bought a box of this herbal tea at my local grocery store and highly recommend trying a smaller quantity before committing to 6 boxes of it here.  Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor "blossomed" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea "dances around the sides of your tongue."  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the "flavor burst", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The "flavor burst" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil.

review/summary: Stashed Premium Chamomile Herbash
review/text: After a lengthy trek in the Himalayan Range, the Himalayas, or Himalayalabalyakamonkatonka for short, in Tibetan, (a mountain range in Asia, separating the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau), I was in bad shape.  First of all, my scrotum shrunk from the extended lack of healthy oxygen.  Secondly, I had all sorts of intestinal problems due to my diet of yak meat only.  Thirdly, I had plenty of holes in my socks and underpants.<br /><br />I eventually made it to a small town in China where I visited the local Apothecary.  A man, if I recall correctly, by the name of Ying Yang Ping Pong Luke, recommended Chamomile Herbal Tea.  I had often heard of the healing properties of it in old and ancient Zulu scripts (pictographic and ideographic) but had never tried it since I despised teas.<br /><br />Well, after a few months on a Chamomile Herbal Tea only diet plus brown rice, I was fixed up.  Chamomiles are medicinal plants.  They are  emmenagogues, stomachics, carminatives, diaphoretics, antispasmodics, and sedatives.<br /><br />In my case, Chamomile Herbal Tea fought intestinal gas and stimulated my gastric juices and encouraged my appetite.<br /><br />Stash Premium Chamomile Herbal Tea is very weak so some won't like it.  I do because you can drink a nice hot cup before bed and it helps you.  It has no flavor aside from a bitter taste of weed but again, I think of it more as a comfort Tea than something pleasurable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HFBMQ">Neti Pot Starter Kit with 1.5 Oz Aromatic Salt Original Neti Pot Salt</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I21K18">Adagio Teas PersonaliTea 21-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basket</a><br /><br />Nature's Way - Chamomile Flowers, 350 mg, 100 capsules

The other teas were better than expected - but this stuff was just plain unflavorful and weird tasting.  Couldn't taste the strawberry.  Perhaps the weird taste is the Rooibos in the tea.  I have to be sure to never buy a rooibos based tea again, although the stuff is supposed to be good for you.<br /><br />I drink my tea iced and always brew a bag of plain ol green tea in with the herb bags, but I don't think the green tea messed this tea up.  When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'.  I was right.<br /><br />Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers.

review/text: I had a hard time finding the tea I had purchased in the past at my local market.  They had stopped carring the flavor of tea I like eventhough they still carried Stash Tea products.  So I went on the internet and was directed to Amazon and found it right away.  Not only that, the pricing was very competitive and I received delivery including freight and handleing cheaper than I could purchase the tea at the market.  By the way Wild Rasberry Hibiscus is a very good flavor if anyone wants to be adventersome and try it.

review/summary: Something strange
review/text: I love the taste of this herbal tea, but twice now I noticed I have a rasping (breathing discomfort) that may or may not be triggered by it. I bought 4 boxes after trying a sampler but now I'm starting to think I may have a food sensitivity to one of the licorice spice ingredients. Damn shame, but I wanted to put it out there in case I wasn't the only one.

review/summary: The absolute best herbal tea
review/text: My sister suggested this tea to me.  I was looking for a good herbal tea to limit my caffeine, and one I could have in the evening.  Most herbal teas seem very weak to me.  I'm not a big licorice fan, but this doesn't taste strongly of licorice.  As one of the other reviewers said, it just gives you a slightly sweet, slightly licorice aftertaste, which is delightful.  It's great in the evening when I'm craving something sweet - and no calories or caffeine!

review/text: There are plenty of lemon flavored teas especially among well known brands.  I've bought most of them, used only a few tea bags and just didn't like them due to their artificial flavoring. Stash's Meyer Lemon is truly a good, natural tasting lemon.  I love it and have shared a couple of the extra boxes with friends.

review/summary: I'm Wild for this Wild Raspberry Tea
review/text: Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon's convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.

review/text: I love this tea. It has an AMAZING creamy strawberry scent and I just can't get enough of it!<br />Unfortunately like with most teas, the scent is better than taste. I like mixing it with lemon juice and honey - it gets to be simply divine!<br />I like using my big mug and have to put 2 tea bags to get the right flavor. I have a feeling I'll go through it pretty quick. I drink it every day and would recommend this tea to everyone.

review/summary: fav Lemon Ginger tea so far...
review/text: I tried this tea for the first time at a restaurant - 1st time iced - cool & refreshing, 2nd time hot - mmmm. The taste leans more to the ginger side and not the lemon. I have tried other brands such as Yogi and Twinings. I did not like the Yogi brand at all (yuck!), the Twinings' brand while not disgusting taste like lemon tea with a 'hint' of ginger. I have tasted other brands that have a stronger ginger taste than Stash but they've also had a strange taste to them as well so so far Stash is my favorite. This tea is great for upset tummy.

review/text: We've been unable to find this tea in the local stores, so once again, Amazon to the rescue. The tea has a very pleasant aroma, doesn't need sweetners or extra stuff of any kind, and has a very "smooth" taste. There is an aftertaste that lingers for just a moment that really makes this an excellent choice for black licorice lovers.

review/summary: Good For Indigestion
review/text: This is the herbal remedy of choice for those times when I something gross, such as anything from McNasty's or Nasty King. I mix it double-strength in a tall clear glass with 12 ounces of water. I like to watch it change color for five minutes, then I sip it and enjoy the sweet relief. The flavor is lemony, but not overly so, with a good ginger kick. Caffeine free. Excellent. I'd recommend this over Tums or Nasty Bismo any day, and it works better too. Peppermint tea and licorice tea are also good choices for indigestion. Also look into digestive enzymes.

review/summary: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

I was looking for canned dog food that I could order online and have delivered quickly.  Shipping was fast and I tried the Eagle Pack beef right away (before I had used up my other brand cans).  I found out about it on one of the dog food reviews that listed five star and down dog foods.  My dogs had been leaving food in their bowls and it wasn't like them so I started looking at reviews and ingredients and pricing.  This was one of the best for everything.  Doesn't matter what I think, my dogs love it and they look healthier! Another plus was that two of the flavors were Amazon Prime eligible.  Fast and convenient.

review/text: I purchased Celtic Sea Salt on the recommendation of Isabel De Los Rios, author of the Diet Solutions Program.  I have been using this coarse ground as well as the Celtic Gray Sea Salt for about 7 weeks now, and I must say that I really enjoy it.  I had pretty much eliminated salt from my diet before this but this is HEALTHY salt.  It's great to not have to have bland food anymore.  I purchased a wonderful salt pig from Fox Run to hold this salt, as it needs to breathe.  Try this salt - you won't be disappointed.

Not every salt mill will grind it, but if you look you can find what you need or just sprinkle the course grains in your food or soups. Either way, I'm glad to know I'm getting trace minerals with my salt instead of eating bleached and deodorized and ultra=processed stuff with fillers in it.<br /><br />I will continue to use a natural salt for my needs and celtic sea salt does not disappoint. I would buy it again, although I'm interested to try other kinds of salt out there like Himalayan pink salt. I heard Redmond 'Real Salt' does not have as many minerals as these other two brands do.

review/summary: does something for your health NO other salt can do
review/text: A couple of years ago I tried a very strict alkalizing cleanse program to try to reboot my health. There was a VERY restricted list of things I could eat and drink including restricting salt, but two forms of were allowed; dulse which is not salt, and small quantities of Celtic salt. Why?<br /><br />Apparently Celtic salt is alkalizing where other salts are not. The human body has become more acidic in Ph over the decades because of diet. In general the healthier, more alkaline choices of whole grains, fruits and vegetables would support proper/healthy Ph but many people do not follow the best eating guidelines including myself. Little steps like using Celtic salt are easy for me to follow to gain small advantages.<br /><br />This salt also tastes great. Not sharp like regular iodized table salt. Great for table use, cooking, baking and anywhere you'd normally use any kind if salt. Choose fine ground instead though unless you have a salt grinder.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/summary: To say this has minerals and is therefore healthy is misleading and deceptive - this is SALT.
review/text: While this is an unprocessed, and good tasting salt, to say that it contains minerals and is good for you is simply misleading. The amounts present in the salt are so low as to be negligible. Lets take a look at the actual mineral content of a few minerals:<br /><br />The potassium content in one serving (1/4 tsp) is 2mg. This is absolutely nothing and equates to less then 0.1% of your daily value. Its the same deal with all the other minerals. Not enough to make any difference whatsoever. Its just like saying my tap water from the faucet contains minerals.<br /><br />This salt doesn't even contain enough iodine to put on the label and isnt nutritionally relevant - they even admit that on the package. I would actually say that regular iodized table salt is more nutritious because it contains 40% or more of your daily value for iodine. Yet people are even claiming it can prevent radiation!? This is absolutely ridiculous and contains nowhere near the amount of minerals to do anything at all. On their website they like to show that bar graph that shows its superior mineral content. We are dealing with parts per MILLION, folks.<br /><br />It really misleads people when they think they can load up on this salt and they think they are being healthy or getting more nutrients. Dont fool yourself. This stuff is SALT. Any lower sodium content is really negligible and honestly its misleading and deceptive to claim that this is "healthy and doctor recommended".<br /><br />You would have to eat the entire 1/2 pound package to equal about a fourth of a banana's worth of potassium. So, yes, TECHNICALLY they can claim it contains minerals, but they are being deceptive if they claim it will actually make a difference.<br /><br />As far as taste and texture goes, thats a completely different story and I will personally say it tastes great, but I realize this product for what it is - salt. People attribute these health benefits to sea salt that just are not true, and may end up using even more salt then they would have normally, ultimately being even more unhealthy. This is certainly NOT a salt substitute and is NOT for people with low sodium diets. There seems to be this craze around sea salt because it seems all natural and from the Earth, but its health claims are quite unsubstantiated and many people are being fooled.

The seaweed flakes are small and fresh, the salmon bits don't taste overly "fishy", and it makes a nice broth when you pour hot water over it.  However, I like the salty seaweed flavor undimmed, so I sometimes even just sprinkle a package over a bowl of steamed rice and skip the hot water.  My kids, ages 6 and 8, love it as well, though a whole packet is too salty for them.  They each only need half a packet, so you can 'stretch' it to your liking.<br /><br />It definitely shines best when paired with sticky Jasmine rice, steamed rather than boiled.

review/text: I confess that I have not bought this product as listed.  I'm writing to alert the seller and any potential buyers that this price, $7.99 for one packet of four chazuke servings, is ridiculously high.  Is the description wrong, and this is actually more than one packet?  Is the seller really trying to get a 300% markup over regular retail just for selling through Amazon?  If you're thinking of buying Nagatanien ochazuke, you're better off buying the ones sold by Uwajimaya.  Amazon carries these as well, under the "More Buying Choices" box that (for me at least) shows up on the right of the screen.

review/text: Such a shame. I am a Jim Beam lover. This stuff is awful. I find Ashanti Chicken Wing sauce to be superior.

review/summary: Great taste with a kick
review/text: I really enjoyed the taste of this wing sauce. It was a little too watery but corn starch helped. There is a nice kick to this sauce but I added more hot sauce on half the wings for that extra "OMG get me some water" flavor. A few of my guest thought the sauce was spicy enough without adding anything to it. People were asking to take a bottle home with them. lol<br /><br />Great price for this different tasting sauce.

review/summary: Fun, flavorful, and delicious
review/text: These were a great addition to my wedding reception candy buffet.  The purple went perfectly with my all purple buffet theme.  The flavor was great.  There were so many in the box when I received the package - I was quite surprised.<br /><br />Nothing negative to say about the product.  I just caution buyers if ordering during hot months.  Taffy will soften and get super sticky in the wrappers.

review/summary: Save $$ this winter!
review/text: As most of you cinnamon buyers know, cinnamon in grocery stores is outrageously priced! The best I could ever find was $7 for a 1.2 ounce jar. And that only had 12 sticks. We brew a crock pot of apple cider practically 24/7 from October to March and like to add about 3 sticks per half gallon. That was really adding up but I was skeptical when I saw this offer. With free 2 day shipping from Prime, I got 32 ounces for less than the price of 2 grocery store ounces! And I will confirm that this stuff is legit. 3 sticks a day for 120 days!! Cider party!!!

review/summary: This is cassia-not cinnamon
review/text: Yes this is a great deal for cinnamon.. but in actuality it is technically not cinnamon.  Everything that I have read has said that cassia has similar properties and taste to cinnamon but it is NOT, in fact, cinnamon.  This is not a problem if you are using it in arts & crafts or some kind of potpourri, but when it comes to ingesting these (or even attempting to grind them with your coffee grinder- I think they will make short order of your grinder (They are very hard). They also contain a substance called coumarin in a dose high enough to cause liver damage to sensitive individuals. I'm bummed, because I was going to use them to eat/drink, but now I guess my apartment will just smell like cinnamon..everywhere..

review/summary: Maybe the best "cinnamon" for your health
review/text: Great product!<br /><br />It is claimed that this cinnamon (Cinnamomum Burmannii) is not real cinnamon....Perhaps. But, after research, I found it has more healthful effects than "real" cinnamon, and that the harmful coumarin is found in far less amounts in Burmannii versus other "alternate" cinnamons that are the primary forms found in grocery stores.  Burmannii has been shown to have high amounts of cinnamaldehyde (effective anti-inflammatory) and other beneficial compounds.<br /><br />I haven't figured out how to grind it easily yet, as it is very hard. I struggle a bit with my hand coffee grinder. I'm sure I'll figure it out.  The Burmannii is strong but still smells and tastes great... especially in my coffee.

review/summary: Flavorful!
review/text: Frontier cinnamon sticks are very flavorful!  I had recently finished the Taste brand cinnamon sticks I ordered through Amazon.  The  Taste brand was excellent so I was wondering if the Frontier brand would compare.  The Frontier brand is every bit as flavorful & a better value.  I would definitly recommend both brands.  Both are a much better value than purchasing them at traditional retail stores.  The Taste brand does come nicely packaged in clear plastic containers.  The Frontier brand comes in foil bags but there are more for about the same price.
