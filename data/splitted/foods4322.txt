review/text: Our favorite tea (by FAR) is Constant Comment, but we wanted to get the benefits of green tea as well so this is perfect.  It is the best green tea I have tried and we really like it a lot.  It is milder flavored than the regular tea which is unavoidable, I guess, but still a highly enjoyable tea.

review/summary: Finally in Green Tea
review/text: I grew up drinking the typical black teas, and Constant Comment had always been one of my favorite flavors. But, when I started drinking green teas, many years back, they didn't make it with the Constant Comment flavors.  Well, now they do.  :-)  It's a spicy orange flavor (actually contains orange rinds and sweet spice) that I just love. Be aware though, it's not an herbal tea, and is not decaffeinated. Being a green tea, you don't need milk, but I do sweeten it with honey.

review/summary: Yummy - but SUPER high sodium...
review/text: I found this product on Amazon, and I love it. I did order it from Amazon, they had a great price on a pack of six. Please note that the cheese flavor isn't very strong. I usually make sandwiches with regular Spam, mayo, lettuce, and a slice of yellow American cheese. After this came in, I made the same sandwich, minus the slice of cheese, since this Spam had cheese already mixed in. I could taste the cheese, however, the cheese flavor was not as strong as the sandwich with regular Spam and a slice of American.<br /><br />* * * WARNING * * *<br /><br />Spam is famous for being high in sodium - the reason it keeps so long. I received my delivery yesterday (October 28th, 2011) and the best by date was some time in 2014 (don't remember what month).<br />Regular Spam has 730mg of Sodium per 85 grams (3 ounces), or roughly 243mg of sodium per ounce. Spam with Cheese (according to the label) has 720mg of sodium per 2 ounces, or 360mg per ounce.<br /><br />That's 50% more sodium than regular Spam. That is a huge jump for something that is famous for being high in sodium.<br />This is definitely something to consider if you have high blood pressure, like I do.<br /><br />If your blood pressure is in check, and you like Spam, give this product a try. It is tasty. :)

review/summary: Spam with Cheese
review/text: This Spam with cheese is such a versitle product. I cook it with eggs in the morning, can use it by heating in the microwave for super sanwiches on bread with mustard and dill pickles at lunch and also use it to make wonderful vegetable soup. I add some Liptons, onion and beef dip mix and start my tasty soup by adding all kinds of vegetables.  All my Grankids love my soups. I also use this Spam to give my elderly dog his medicine with just a little chunk--I hide his pill and he gobbles it all down. What more can you ask for---OH--I almost forgot--I can chop this in a shredder and add onions , pickles and mayonnaise and hooray for a fine ham tasting salad for sanwiches. It is also great to add to any pasta dishes... I will always have this in my kitchen.

review/text: Several years ago, we found this in the local stores when it was first introduced.  We tried it and loved it.  For people who aren't huge Spam fans, the cheese helps to soften the taste.  For kids, anything with cheese is a big hit.  We haven't been able to find this in stores for a very long time.  Several years ago, we looked at ordering it directly from Spam online but their price was too high and shipping even worse.  Discovering Spam with Cheese at Amazon and Prime eligible is a great find.

review/text: Ok, it's spam and I like spam so there's that.  Cheese? I like cheese too so I figured I should like spam with cheese!  I usually slice up the spam and put it on paper plates and paper towels and zap it for a few minutes in the microwave until the edges are crispy..  well if those little orange balls in the spam are cheese one would think they would melt after being zapped in the micro.. but they never do!  Not sure what they are and I don't really taste much "cheese" flavor in the spam.  Kind of bothers me that they don't melt so this spam won't be re-ordered again.  However I do highly recommend the Spam with BACON, that one's a real winner!

review/summary: Tasty with OK nutrition if you're careful
review/text: I've been buying Spam products from Amazon over the past year. I tend to favor Spam Turkey, With Bacon, and With Cheese, so my commentary focuses on these three. Each of these three can be fairly tasty depending on the exact use. When Amazon's pricing dips below $15, then it beats pricing at my local supermarket. Above $15, and I start checking out my local sales.<br /><br />An obvious consideration with Pam is its nutritional value, or possible lack there of. So I looked up some of the relevant nutritional information, some of which I will repeat here. You should consider doing the same.<br /><br />Each can of Spam holds 12 ounces, or six servings (in Hormel's estimation). Each serving of Turkey Spam has 80 calories. The bacon and cheese versions have 180 and 170 calories, respectively.<br /><br />A serving of Turkey Spam has 4.5 grams of total fat and 1.5 grams of saturated fat. The numbers for Bacon Spam are 16 and 6 grams. And for Cheese Spam, the numbers are 15 and 6 grams. The recommended daily reference values are 65 and 20 grams.<br /><br />A serving of Turkey Spam has 35 mg of cholesterol while the others have 40 mg of cholesterol. The recommended daily value is 300 mg.<br /><br />A serving of Turkey Spam And Bacon Spam have 520 mg of sodium. Cheese Spam has 720 Mg. The recommended daily value is 2400 mg.<br /><br />Essentially this means that Turkey Spam is healthier than the others, but any of these versions of Spam can fit into a nutritious program SO LONG AS you limit the servings and don't use a lot of fatty oil if you fry your servings. If you insist on eating a whole can every day, you will tend to be fat with clogged arteries and high blood pressure.<br /><br />I don't fry my Spam although it's tempting to do that a slice at a time for breakfast. Instead, I tend to use Turkey Spam diced in pasta salads and sliced for sandwiches. The cheese and bacon versions have a more distinctive taste, and I use them mostly to add some meat to the Betty Crocker mashed potatoes that I also buy from Amazon.<br /><br />Of course, Spam IS very tasty and when fried is always a winner with kids. As long as they don't gorge themselves on it, it should be fine. In the end, the key with Spam as with many other foods is to be moderate and balanced in what you eat.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

review/text: This is a great tasting variety of Spam. I think the desired goal was to heat it up and add some melted cheese into it. But I don't think it worked out.<br /><br />SPAM with Cheese tastes like standard SPAM, which by itself is good. When I friend some of it in a frying pan I did not see those little pieces of cheese melt like I thought but it still tasted good like SPAM.<br /><br />So I would say if you're looking for a sale on SPAM and see this on sale there are no surprises.

You can eat it right out of the jar, put it in smoothies, spread it on toast, put it on veggies instead of butter, make frosting, put it in your curry, mix it up in raw food bars--perfect for kids' breakfasts or lunch boxes...there are so many things you can do with this stuff. It's the perfect food.<br /><br />I love coconut in any form, so I am going to be partial to this. But I've tried other coconut butters and this is the best I've had. This is not to be confused with coconut oil, it's thick, fibrous and has a sweet flavor and you don't cook with it like you do the oil. Coconut oil is great too, but I would not eat it with a spoon.<br /><br />Artisanas coconut butter is nutritious and deeply satisfying. It's one of my top favorite foods on earth. Premier Organics, the makers of Artisana, is an environmentally responsible company, so you can also feel great about supporting them.

review/text: This stuff is soooooooooooooo good. I could eat it out of the jar all day! My only problem is how RIDICULOUSLY overpriced this is. Its currently ~$13 at my local Whole Foods. As a college student,I can't be spending that much on something like this!<br /><br />That said, I found a CHEAP, EASY alternative that tastes JUST like it. I went to my local indian food store and bought a few bags of powdered / coconut flakes for about $1.50 , threw it in the blender on pulse for a few min, then on high, then on medium, then when it started getting clumped and creamy I set it to low for about 5-6 minutes. Tastes JUST Like it, same consistency, taste, everything. No oil needed,no milk, no sugar, no heat, not even a food processor. The oils come out naturally from the dried coconut flakes/ powder. The butter came out a bit creamier than that in the can, which is a bonus for some considering consistency seemed to be the biggest complain against this product. Anyways, I just saved myself over $10 making this in 15min or less. Artisana is banking serious $$ on something so simple and inexpensive to make. Enjoy! Thank me later lol.

review/summary: Great butter by the best coconut brand!
review/text: I purchased this along with the Artisana Raw Organic Coconut Oil. After having tried about 4 other coconut oil/product brands, Artisana is BY FAR the BEST tasting. This butter is heavenly...it is hard so when you melt it you can spread it on apple slices, banana slices, on toast, or in between two cookies or two graham crackers...YUM! Plus, it offers the good fat from the coconut, along with fiber, amino acids, and minerals. Awesome. You will not be disappointed with this brand. P.S.- Artisana is an environmentally-friendly company, and uses only glass jars to store their oils and butters. Very important to purchase only glass jars with fats because they can oxidize quickly and can absorb things that leech out of plastic!

review/text: I love this product, but I also love Coconut. After reading several of the online reviews about the consistency I decided to offer my routine.<br />I have also purchased Nutiva Coconut Manna which I also like a lot. However this product does seems a bit more moist then the other one. I do still purchase both. The whole thing about these items is getting them to where the oil and the raw fibers are really well blended and if you fail to do that it could really be the difference between loving it or vowing never to eat it again.<br />When I get a new jar I remove the plastic around the rim, then I put it in about a half inch of water in a pan (place the whole jar)...on a medium simmer. Watch it a few minutes and use an oven mitt to remove it when you really see it melt down. I then take it out of the water open it up and take a butter knife and slowly stir the oils into the fibers. This can take a few minutes but once it is done it is fabulous. You will see it transform and become really smooth,... at this point I take out what I am going to use then replace the cover tightly and put it upside down and leave in on my counter as I use it everyday. It stays mixed and smooth when I need it after I've mixed it the initial first time. It is a great source of energy, however I do understand that it is not for everyone. I will say that I use it on old fashioned oatmeal with a touch of maple syrup and a tablespoon of natural applesauce and the flavor combination and energy derived from this is  incredible. Hope that this helps someone.

review/summary: Excellent, tasty product
review/text: This is fabulous coconut butter.  I was having a hard time with dry skin on elbows and heels, even EXPENSIVE creams and treatments were not resolving the issue.  My doctor (Dr. Michael Platt - check out his book here at Amazon) recommended a daily tablespoon of coconut butter as the remedy - in about 3 weeks problem disappeared!  The long chain fatty acids in the coconut butter fixed me right up.  It's great on toast and comes in multiple flavors (not personally too fond of the Amazon Bliss though.....)

review/summary: Better than Imagined
review/text: Ariana Coconut Butter is better than I imagined it could be!!! And I thought I liked peanut butter. Wow. This coconut butter is like food from heaven or something.<br /><br />I have been trying to find a way to incorporate more coconut oil into my diet. I'm definitely adding this product to my staple foods list! It is so delicious, I think I could eat a whole jar in one sitting! I haven't tried melting it, or using it as an ingredient. So far, I just can't stop eating it right out of the jar.<br /><br />I have never tasted other coconut butters, so I can't compare this one with other brands. I just know this is so good.

review/summary: FABULOUS Product
review/text: I found this same brand at my local health food store for less than half the online price.  It IS a solid, but a temperate solid at that. I'm able to easily spread it onto hot flax seed muffins and it has an amazing true coconut taste. There are instructions about tempering the product (jar in hot water) and mixing the whole mess together if yours has a little oil separation in it; you can google the instructions.<br />Very pleased with this product and am in total love with the flavor! Some folks claim the 'coconut butter' and coconut oil are the same product, and they are not. I use Nutiva coconut oil which is a full flavored, aromatic coconut oil, but I'd sure not slather it on muffins. The 'butter' from this brand is truly like a delicious coconut spread and isn't just coconut oil, it has a high fiber/coconut particulate content. I've used spoonfuls of the coconut butter in curries to give a nice flavor and I bet this would add flavor and richness to a smoothie.

review/summary: Cadillac of Coconut Products
review/text: It's true that Artisana Coconut Butter is expensive - here in Australia it's about $20 AUD. The taste, however, IS really so good that it's worth it. This is such a convenient product to have at home or work, as it's so nourishing, filling, and delicious. In a pinch, it makes a good meal substitute when spread over a piece of sourdough bread. After arriving at an understanding that coconut is in fact a health food, I tried several coconut products. As soon as I tried this one, I knew I'd found my heaven...this stuff is dreamy!  Unlike other coconut butters/oils, this one won't leave you with a sour, disagreeable aftertaste. This is made with actual coconut flesh, so the taste is fresh and delicate. This makes the perfect dairy butter substitute - Vegans in particular should invest in this, though it's hard to imagine anyone who wouldn't love it. It's that rare marriage of health and taste we're all looking for.<br /><br />P.S. For those who don't like this brand, another coconut oil/butter to try is 'Virgin Oil De Coco-Creme' by Quality First International - Sarma Melngailis sells it on her site.

review/text: The first taste seemed bitter but it really grows on you quickly, we eat a spoonful once a day directly from the jar. It is Winter right now so we slightly warm the jar in warm water to melt it. It is so good and good for you! Just disregard the reviews that complain about the calories because they obviously do not know the difference between "good" and "bad" fat. Eating this raw will speed up your metabolism and help burn the excess weight off your body.

review/summary: It doesn't get any better than this
review/text: This coconut butter's quality is very consistently high (across the 3 bottles I've used).<br /><br />It will turn solid during cooler temps, and will need to be scraped with a spoon. In summer it turns to liquid, and the oil separates and floats on top. I recommend stirring thoroughly before each use, if it's watery enough.<br /><br />The taste? Sublime. There is a strong pleasant aroma of coconuts when I bring the bottle close. I eat 1-2 teaspoons per day (not mixed with anything else), and each time it captivates my taste buds and won't let turn my attention to anything else until I've licked the spoon clean. It helps me snap out of morning grogginess, and I think my mood actually improves. The taste is also faintly sweet, but not overly so; if you prefer sweet foods, this might be bland to you.<br /><br />There is a slight grainy-ness in liquid form, even after stirring, but I have no problem with that. It's thick and viscous so you probably want to give your saliva time to work on it before you swallow. I find that I can't eat too much in one sitting. Maybe because it's so satisfying (or maybe because in the back of my mind, I recall how much I'm spending for this stuff).<br /><br />I've noticed a slight laxative effect; perhaps it's due to the high fiber content. I've read a couple online forums that advise adding a little lime to avoid this. I have no idea whether this works.<br /><br />Coconut is allegedly very good for your health, containing the medium-chain fatty acid, lauric acid. (Don't believe the "saturated-fat-is-bad" fear-mongering.)

review/text: I thought about whether it was worth paying over 10 bucks for a jar of food for the longest time. Then I finally decided to try it. I was not disappointed. I love coconuts, and this is a very intense, not-too-sweet bang of coconut. The ways I have enjoyed this great stuff so far is by the spoonful, added to fudge, an in various coconut curries. On its own it tastes fantastic, and it really adds depth to other foods. I can't imagine wasting this stuff eating it on bread.

review/text: I've been listening to a lot of "livin' la vida low carb" podcasts lately and both Gary Taubes and Diane Sanfilippo raved about Artisana coconut butter. It is really expensive but the way they went on I had to try it. Taubes even said it helps him sleep like a baby at night. When it arrived, I could not believe how amazing it tasted. Usually when someone raves about a product I wind up feeling meh about it. Things don't typically live up to their hype. In this case, I couldn't stop groaning with pleasure (and eating, and eating!) and my husband was ready to deck me. You have to taste it to believe it. Out of this world.

review/summary: The most healthful and divine tasting food
review/text: I grew up eating coconuts.  After living for four decades in the USA, I reconnected with my roots and now I feel even better knowing that raw coconut oil is beneficial for one's health.  There are several brands out there but the Artisana brand coconut butter is a class by itself.The Artisana raw coconut butter is the closest thing to the taste of a fresh coconut since it contains fibers of fresh coconut, truly great.  There is a plethora of misleading articles out there that condemned coconut as a very harmful food.  Fact: coconut butter has medium chain triglyceride (MCT) so it is easily absorbed by your body and not deposited onto your arteries to clog it.  I am not a dietician but I've read enough reports that extol this miracle butter, so, I am joining those in the know about the healthful benefits of this miracle oil.  It is almost counterintuitive that coconut oil is good for you when it is mostly saturated fat but this is a very good saturated fat.  There are good and bad fats out there, I just give you two examples, the bad and the good: hydrogenated fats are bad, high lignan cold pressed flax seed oil is good for your heart health.  Now you can add coconut butter to the good fat, so you can start eating it today without fear.<br /><br />Fresh coconut meat is known as an appetite suppressant so if you plan to eat a lot of food, try to have a handful of fresh coconut meat before going out.  In NYC you could get fresh coconut meat (out of the shell) in ethnic supermarkets (Indian, Asian, Spanish) or your local health food stores or juice bars.  A local Korean green grocer in midtown NYC sells coconut meat by the pound.<br /><br />To go back into the Artisana brand coconut butter, just eat it plain, scooped it with a spoon right into your mouth as I do.  Absolutely delicious.  It has pieces of shredded coconut meat in it.  Do not refrigerate, please.  If you scoop it out of a jar and smear it on a piece of hot toast, it could melt beautifully, like butter but better for you.  I put mine in my health shake in the morning, just delicious.  I wish more people would discover the miracle of Artisana cold pressed coconut butter.  It would change their health and life forever.  Thank you, Artisana for your commitment to producing great raw butters.

review/summary: Dissapointed after reading great reviews
review/text: This was my first jar of coconut butter and after reading the fantastic reviews, I expected something creamy and delicious. It's not creamy at all unless you stick it in the microwave for 30 seconds, and then it's still not really spreadable.. I've used it to make toasted cheese and toasted peanut butter sandwhiches. The first time I used it, I thought it gave an interesting taste and was nice, but the 2nd time, didn't seem that great.. 3rd time, it didn't melt well at all..I'm not sure if I used the fat from it the first time around or what, but it became almost crumbly when I used it the 2nd time. I tried putting it on brown rice instead of butter, but it didn't melt well and didn't add a great taste at all. It's kind of grainy actually.. Not a smooth consistancy.. For the price I paid for this, I'm very dissapointed. I have searched for recipes to make this myself and have found some that sound like they may end up being a bit tastier, so I'll try making my own from here on out.. I love coconut and all things coconut, but to be honest, I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone, especially at this price.

review/summary: Great product but not ideal for making coconut milk
review/text: The reason I bought this product: different pages on the internet describe how you can make coconut milk out of coconut butter (e.g. this one here: [...]) and I have been wanting to replace my regular coffee milk with a non-dairy product (I make cafe latte at home and end up drinking LOTS of milk!)<br />NOTE: My ultimate goal is to use products that have not additives.<br /><br />I followed the instructions; heated up a spoonful of coconut butter, added just a little bit of water -- enough for a cup of milk -- and stirred it until it was blended... it tasted great in my coffee but the texture was thin and watery (I guess that's why they use guar gum in other coconut milk products) and it doesn't really froth up (I didn't really expect it to but was still hoping it would!) so overall, it's a fantastic product and I will use it for cooking, baking etc. but sadly, it didn't really work out as milk.

review/summary: Nice Flavor but Very Hard at Room Temp
review/text: I bought the Artisana from [...] where it was $11 instead of $13.  I also bought finely shredded "Let's Do Organic" coconut.  The Artisana was good, but the flavor not as "coconutty" as I had hoped.  And, unless I nuke the jar, it shaves off when I try to scoop it--like cutting into frozen butter, an annoying chore.  It is better when warmed.<br /><br />I followed one reviewer's suggestion and now make my own.  I use my Blendtec (a super blender like a Vita-Mix, both of which will grind concrete), but I add in some warm water.  It whips up smooth (no granuals) and fluffy like icing.  Once you add water, you do need to refrigerate the mixture, as the water, over time, will make the coconut go sour.  I put it in my Asian curry veggie soup, and it worked great, and it is tasty on toasted nut bread.  I also mixed in some dark chocolate chips, a little sweetener, and made a very tasty chocolate mousse.  So the Artisana experience has greatly enriched my life--but only because I have learned to make my own.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I began purchasing coconut oil as a supplement for my dog when he was diagnosed with cancer, as evidently it's a cancer fighter.  Not only did my ill dog love it but my other one did as well, so I continued using the oil until I came upon this product at Whole Foods.  Thought I would give it a try, since they liked the oil so much I figured they would go crazy for the butter and I was right - they LOVE it.  I've now switched to solely using the Artisana Organic Coconut Butter on their food twice a day and I use it myself too - it's delicious on toast instead of regular butter.  It's pricey (I go through a jar a week) but worth it for the all the health benefits it offers.  Better off buying at Whole Foods than here, just $9.99 a jar, on sale now for $7.99.  Highly recommended, it's delicious and good for you!

review/summary: No safety seal and loose lid upon arrival
review/text: Well I was really excited about this coconut butter but when I received it the product was in a small box inside a larger box with some padding. When I opened up the larger box and pulled out the smaller box it was saturated with oil on at least 70% of the box. I opened it up and the product was VERY seperated and the oil had leaked out onto everything! The jar was so oily I could barely hold it without it slipping. Anyway i washed it off and opened it to find that there was not only not an air tight seal (obvious by the leaking) but there no no safety seal under the lid like most products have....Anyway I called up Amazon and they gave me a refund. The product once mixed well seemed like it would be pretty good and had a nice smell. However I'm scared to use it at this point...did everyone else have a safety seal on theirs?

review/summary: Wonderful stuff if you like coconut
review/text: I tried this for the first time spread on a slice of homemade quick bread. WOW this is good! However, I'm not sure why so many people say it doesn't taste like coconut. I think it tastes exactly like coconut. Which doesn't surprise me, and is fine with me because I love coconut. I can see using this a lot on toast, pancakes, muffins, etc., but I don't think it's a replacement for butter in savory dishes. Maybe the coconut flavor diminishes when it's used in a recipe. And while it is very tasty, the consistency is a bit of a problem for me. Room temperature at my house is in the upper 70s in September, and coconut butter is in liquid form at this temperature. This does make it easier to mix it up before using though, since I don't need to stir it and can just shake the jar to mix it all together. Since you're not supposed to refrigerate it, I guess I'll need to wait for cooler weather to see if it firms up.

review/summary: Butter Me Up, Baby!
review/text: Since going Primal, I've been incorporating a lot of good fats into my diet.  After reading about Artisana coconut butter in paleo/primal blogs a number of times, I decided to purchase some.  I think the taste is pretty good, but, at first, I found the mouth-feel to be a bit off-putting.  My first little spoonful was pretty much coconut oil.  After heating the jar a bit and stirring it up good, I tried again.  At first, it was like a mouthful of powdery peanut butter.  The coconut butter stuck to my teeth, tongue, and the roof of my mouth and the texture felt like I'd taken a spoonful of baby powder.  (I believe that this is because the coconut is dried and then ground to make this paste.)  After a few seconds, the mixture felt like it was melting on my tongue, like good chocolate does, getting soft and creamy, but it also felt like it was expanding, growing in my mouth.  After a few tastes, I started to adjust to the texture and really enjoyed the strangely sweet but not sweet taste of the coconut butter.  I also really like the ingredient list:  organic raw coconut.  No added sugar - that's hard to beat.  One thing that sort of surprised me though, besides the powdery texture, was that this didn't taste or smell like coconut.  I didn't expect it to taste like a fresh coconut, but I expected some sort of fundamental coconut taste.  The Nutiva coconut oil I bought (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JRKDC">Nutiva - Coconut Oil Organic Extra Virgin, 29 oz solid</a>) has more flavor.<br /><br />The product description says that refrigeration is not recommended.  I don't know why they recommend against it, but I keep mine in the fridge because it makes me feel more comfortable about keeping a single jar and snacking out of it for a couple of months.  To get a spoonful, I remove the top and microwave the jar for 15 to 20 seconds - just enough to melt the coconut oil that may have risen to the top and soften the meat.  I did have this out on the counter for a few days and it was pretty solid even sitting out so I'd expect that you have to heat it regardless of where you store it.  Thus far, I just get a little spoonful of it now and then, but I imagine it would be good paired with some fruit if you needed a little something else to eat it on.<br /><br />Overall, I don't know that I'll ever consume massive quantities of this stuff like some of the primal/paleo bloggers out there, but it's an easy way to add those healthy fats to my diet.

review/text: I rarely write reviews, but this came today, and I had to comment. One of my favorite dessert foods has always been cheesecake, and this is seriously BETTER than cheesecake. I was nearly in heaven when I ate my first spoonful of this. It tastes oddly sweet but only has 1.9g of sugar per serving (2 tbsp per serving, 16 servings per jar). I follow the paleo diet and this is definitely going on the list of perfect foods.<br /><br />I'm going to order 5 more right after I finish this. This stuff is incredible.

review/summary: Delicious and healthy!
review/text: I just bought some from my local health food store for about $8 for the same size jar- it is absolutely scrumptious on toasted multi-grain bread or croissants paired with jam. I mix it with a touch of raw organic coconut oil for a spreadable treat- I sometimes crave it and start spooning it out of the jar. PLus it fills you up right and gives you a smooth energy boost.  But I saw it here online for $50-$99 a jar- is this some kind of joke or are they selling it by the case? Do not buy it for more than $10-15 a jar- and certainly not for 50-99 bucks a jar! They sell this at many natural food stores- buy it there or try their website for links to retailers who sell it for reasonable prices. But do get it, it is delicious-

review/summary: I cant stop eating this!
review/text: I have not posted a review before, but this so impressed me that I just had to.<br /><br />This stuff is great. It tastes FANTASTIC! And I have noticed some EXTRA, positive, benefits from taking it, too.<br /><br />I cant stop eating it! Seriously, I am craving it (maybe my body needs something that's in it). But what I have also noticed is that after I take it, for maybe 3 or 4 hours, it seems to suppress my appetite and cravings, which I have never had anything do that before. Now I have to MAKE myself eat, sometimes. (Gotta work on THAT one!)<br /><br />I have been having some problems lately (being 45) with my metabolism slowing down and me gaining weight and feeling hungry all the time. -I assume due to getting older and hormones and such.<br /><br />Well, it made me feel like I was not hungry at all. Sometimes I did eat anyway (well, more than I should have, even though I wasnt hungry), which was not smart on my part, but, again ... I will have to work on that one.<br /><br />How? I am going to try to take advantage of it suppressing my appetite to try to eat less and healthier. Maybe this will give me give me the extra help/boost I needed.<br /><br />Maybe I can LIVE on this stuff! (Ha, ha!) I have read all the comments, and someone said it DID help her lose weight.<br /><br />I am taking a tablespoon twice a day (I don't want to take too much). And I will continue this and see how it goes. Maybe add a third one.<br /><br />Oh, and I agree with those others about buying it somewhere else. I got mine at Whole Foods for (I think) about $8 dollars on sale. I was checking here what Amazon wanted, but I will apparently be going back there for more!<br /><br />About making your own ... it IS a bit pricey, but you're getting raw AND organic, so is it really worth it to make your own (buying raw, organic flakes)?<br /><br />Oh, and the OTHER health benefit. -I have been fighting a problem (I am talking on and off for a couple of YEARS) of a yeast combination dermatitis on my hands. It will seem like it is improving, then comes back. I have been at my wits end. Dr.'s and creams and medicine and trying to change my diet (EXTREMELY hard!) and nothing has kept it from going away completely.<br /><br />I read somewhere that coconut oil was a strong antifungal, and when I got the oil at WF's, I saw this and thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />My hands have been improving A LOT.<br /><br />Now I don't know if they will STAY improved, or if it is the CB helping. (I am also taking cinnamon, which I read showed antifungal benefits on fungal infections that were resistant to medications - but I had been taking it before and it didn't help as much as this.) Maybe both together?<br /><br />I don't know, and I don't want to get my hopes up, but I am going to keep trying BOTH of them. I do take pro-biotic's, though they have never seemed to help much.<br /><br />I cant say if it will have the same benefits for everyone as it has me, but I'd say its worth trying. And I admit I have only been using it a week and a half, so I don't know if it will make a difference in the long run or not. (I HOPE so!)<br /><br />Sorry to be so long, but I wanted to be thorough and to explain all of how it helped me.

review/summary: Decent coconut product but....
review/text: This coconut product is okay but.....it's extremely sweet and coconutty, which might turn some people off. Even the smell of it can get a little repulsive. The color is milky white. The texture is a little grainy and nutty. The smell and taste are very strong and sweet, it's like a kick to your nose. The consistency is thick and creamy when you stir it. I accidently had a little too much the first time i tried it(4 teaspoons straight out of the jar) and i got really nauseous and it really loosened me up if you know what i mean. I put some in my tea or hot cocao for the taste and it makes it taste a little better. Overall i would recommend this product only to real coconut lovers. If you're not a big fan of coconuts in general, don't buy this.

review/summary: horrible taste and texture
review/text: After reading all of the positive reviews, I was anxious to try out this product.  I was so disappointed when I got it.  The texture is chalky and the taste to me is unpleasant.  I tried cooking with it, but it burns like butter does so I will stick to saute'ing with my coconut oil (which I love!).<br /><br />I hate to waste money, so after going back and reading the reviews again I took the suggestion of warming it up so I could mix it up.  It became more of a spreadable consistency, but the grainy texture and the taste did not improve.  I'm going to try using some of it in my smoothies, but if it still doesn't taste good to me, it's going into the garbage.<br /><br />I also ordered the Artisana Cacoa Bliss (which is coconut butter with cacoa added to give it a "chocolate" flavor) and Artisana Macadamia butter.  I had the same same bad experience with the Cacoa Bliss in that it was gritty and even the cacoa did not give it a better flavor.  I did, however, really like the macadamia butter a lot.

review/summary: Coconut Lovers Rejoice!
review/text: I am a lover of all things coconut.  Milk, water, oil, flesh and now butter!  This coconut butter is actually a lot like coconut oil, in that it contains coconut oil plus flesh, which makes it a soft, buttery spreadable condiment.  While this jar is sitting on my counter it's about 85-90 degrees during the day and since I've had it it's remained soft and oily (coconut oil/butter hardens when cold) and I've had to stir it in order to get the thicker fleshy part mixed in with the oil that rises to the surface.  I use it to spread on whole grain toast, I put a spoonfull in fruit smoothies, have put the oil on my hair and face and take a spoonfull at night before I go to sleep.  Coconut has many benefits, and Artisana Coconut butter is raw/organic and is a great value.

review/summary: Great for hair and cooking
review/text: I use this product in my hair because it is a great moisturizer and sealant (I have natural kinky african american hair). After I washed my hair, I applied this product section by section and twisted my hair. It made my hair noticeably softer and SHINIER. No more dry, dull curls. The only downside is that after a day or so, the butter began to flake and it looked like I had dandruff, so then I had to wash my hair all over again. I'm thinking maybe I should lightly microwave the butter first, and then apply it to my hair...<br /><br />Also, before I began to use it in my hair, I tasted a little bit out of curiosity. The flavor is very light and not very sweet (but that's to be expected from an organic raw product). It has no additional sweeteners or preservatives. From what I've read, coconut oil is a great, healthy substitute to traditional oils used in cooking. Good luck!

review/summary: I like it.
review/text: At room temperature, this is a hard, almost wax-like substance. You pretty much end up shaving the top with a spoon, resulting in a crumbly mess. I really didn't want to stick it in the microwave, but I'm far too lazy to heat it any other way. So I did. 30 seconds in the microwave pretty much tranformed it into something far creamier and more pleasant. Kind of like grainy almond butter....only better because it tastes like coconut, and I adore coconut. Yes, it is grainy, which is to be expected from a product made from dried coconut....some say floury, which I can see. It doesn't bother me, and I eat a whole lot of it on apple slices, or drizzled over sliced bananas with shaved dark chocolate.<br />The thing that really irritates me about this product is the HYPE. Good god. It's pureed coconut. It's a nice treat, but it is certainly not worth the effort of finding it (for me anyways...near impossible) or the money it costs. I feel like a bit of a sucker for believing half the people on here saying it tastes like the nectar of the gods or something. Artisana does not throw magical fairy dust in their product. You could easily make your own with a decent food processor and a bag of organic coconut flakes.

review/text: The company wanted me to try it. This is my review I think it is not as sweet as some of the other reviews here says it is. But it is thicker than the oil and has a consistency like frosting. Mostly it is good to use as a spread like the almond butter.<br /><br />I wouldn't refridgerate it though it can be frozen like it says in the description. The pack gave me a choice of the almond butter which is good and tasty but not as sweet as I would like. If I can figure out how to put this in a cheesecake I will that would be a nice added ingredient. Just an idea.<br /><br />Overall, recommend :)

review/summary: Incredible taste, but shop around on the price
review/text: I love the taste of coconut butter, far more than coconut oil. I have never managed to attempt making my own, but I love putting a little of this coconut butter in my morning protein smoothie - tastes great with everything. I usually buy it at a nearby health food store, and which store has the best price always changes. I just always keep my eyes peeled for any store selling 16 oz. jars for $10 or less. Sometimes I see it priced for $15+ per jar, and I hold off. Yesterday bought it at a local Whole Foods for $9!

review/summary: I LIKE
review/text: Awesome product. Really yummy and good for your health.<br />I tried 'Living Foods E.V. Coconut Oil' too, and like them both. Difference is that Artisana has more murky, unfiltered color (ivory) and texture. Both of them hardens when the temperature drops, but at around 65F it is like margarine - no problem scooping out from the jar. It melts instantaneously on contact on heated pans. I read that someone even put it in coffee so just tried one generous tea spoonful of it in my coffee... didn't like it. It was greasy...naturally. I use it mostly for baking and on toast it's wonderful. Really like its subtle flavor. (Took out one star because it is much cheaper at Whole Foods).

review/summary: Simply the best
review/text: This is the best butter, I have ever tasted. It does not have an overpowering taste of coconut. I had a problem buying it through the Amazon, I had to order it from another company. It was the Post Office employee who caused this problem, they kept it too long, and did not even notify ,me that they had our  package.

review/summary: it does not taste like coconut, at all!
review/text: I was so excited to try this butter and when I finally did, I was soooo disappointed. The taste is not good at all, in fact it tastes like there is some kind of flour in it, very weird...Im going to stick with coconut oil that is way tastier. Oh, besides, this is a freaking expensive product.

review/summary: can't figure out all the good reviews
review/text: This is not good, it's not sweet and it is loaded with fat and calories. It barely even tastes like coconut. It is bland, and greasy. Maybe if you are seeking some sort of health benefit you could convince yourself to eat this....but, if you like regular food, this isn't something you will want in the cupboard.<br /><br />I hesitated to post a review because I see anyone who gives this product a bad review gets lots "not helpful" votes.(funny,huh?)I just hate to see someone order this thinking it is a delicious treat.

review/summary: Artisana Organic Raw Coconut Butter 16 oz Jar
review/text: UGH!  I was so excited to receive the package of what I thought was coconut "oil".  Maybe my mistake?  I just opened one of the jars of the Artisana Organic Raw coconut Butter and it is AWFUL!  Lots of thin liquid, combined with extremely hard "stuff" stuck to the sides and in large chunks throughout the jar that has the consitency and feel (in your mouth) of thick, gritty plaster.  I tried to mix things up but ... forget it!  Even the taste is not very pleasant.  I bought three jars.  One is now opened so I guess I'm stuck with it.  Will attempt to return the other 2 jars and hope to get a refund or an exchange for a different brand of " coconut oil".<br />I even give coconut oil to my dogs, but would not give them this product.  Clearly, it cannot be used for skin conditioning because it's a yucky mess. Can someone please provide a clue to what is wrong with this??

review/summary: Add it to hot water and make greasy hot water!
review/text: I tried this in hot water and it tasted and felt like greasy water (and I mean spit it out into the sink greasy). It did have a nice aroma. I added some unsweetened hot chocolate and it was awful so I put in some saccharin. It tasted like greasy hot chocolate. I fail to see the charm.<br /><br />I've also tried melting it onto warm pancakes. It doesn't spread well. Butter or margarine makes the pancakes taste a lot better than this does. They are much cheaper and they spread easier.<br /><br />Also there is some confusion here. Some say coconut is bad for you. Others, mostly new age types, say it cures everything. It's a panacea. Very suspicious. One thing for sure it's high in calories. If you're eating it out of the jar, you're taking in a lot of calories. Of course maybe you don't believe in calories. I do. I've heard some claims that eating this stuff will cause you to lose weight. I seriously doubt that.<br /><br />I like coconut, but I haven't found a use for this stuff and my lips are still greasy.

review/text: I ordered coconut butter, and received coconut oil.  Wow.  Awesome.  Best part is that when I put in to return it, I'm not able to exchange it for the correct product.  So, I have to sit and wait for a refund.  This is unacceptable and quite inconvenient.  When the invoice clearly says "butter," why do you send "oil?"

review/summary: My Little Boy Loves Goldfish Colors.
review/text: My little boy (3 1/2 yrs. old) just loves Goldfish. I'm not sure where he got it, perhaps the grandparents. In any case, I have trouble with him in a little store I go to because they have a display of Goldfish cartons and we can't get by it without getting one. Any of you with kids probably understand. Well, now he loves Goldfish Colors and that probably also goes back to Grandpa. In any case, now Goldfish aren't good enough and Goldfish Colors are the only thing that will do. Fortunately, the store has some 6.6-ounce bags of them, so every time we're there we have to pick one up. Oh well, I enjoy Goldfish too so there's never any problem in getting rid of them. Personally, I grew up on Cheezits, but I like Goldfish just as well. Now I notice the Goldfish bag has a little notice in the upper left-hand corner that specifies the colors are from natural ingredients. That's good as I don't trust all dyes.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Good for YOU and Good for Children and FUN to EAT plus some NEAT-O TRICKS & TIPS!
review/text: Once again Pepperidge Farms has created a wholesome snack that is not only good for you but also good for children too; and a whole lotta fun to eat! Forget junk food when there's better food that's not only fun but wholesome and satisfying  but be careful; there are other "fisherpeople" out there who will raid your snack!<br /><br />Here's a bonus for those who were unaware - they are not "salty" like others are, plus for more specific info; you can always visit the Pepperidge Farms for they have various other products that are diabetic to heart healthy. Additional bonus is people who wear dentures won't die of embarrassment and enjoy the pleasure of munching on these beloved crackers. And those who have dental medical conditions by reason of medications or some type of genetic or health issues will also find these easy to eat as well - making them easier for Parents to Caretakers to monitor their loved ones or the ones they are overseeing.<br /><br />I also use these as Salad Toppers instead of hard croutons for a "Spring / Summer" fun - it adds spark and interest as well as contrast to your salad; even when entertaining ... who would have ever thought of tossing these precious yummies into salads? And plus, if you can't get your child to eat salad, they will when they see Pepperidge Goldfish in there swimming in cheese, lettuc, tomatoes - or even a Taco Salad to make Food interesting and introduction to healthy-eating to a child.<br /><br />If you have a picky eater (child) that just won't eat his/her veggies or just only specific types; try tossing a few Goldfish and sprinkle with cheese after cooking or steaming veggies and then at last minute toss in the fresh grated favorite cheese and some goldfish and toss; serve dinner immediately and observe after remarking that we're eating goldfish tonight that is swimming in our food.  (Leave it at that...) That is how I got my step-grandson to begin to eat other vegetables besides green beans, potatoes and corn. He was having too much fun playing and eating the veggies and "swimming" while eating at the same time that he forgot the rest of his dinner! *laughing*<br /><br />Thought I would toss an old trick I had done to my son when he was young, it still works... those Pepperidge Farm Goldfish are magical!

I'm so happy I found these.  The "whole grain" makes me less guilty about eating handfuls of this thing at a time ;)

review/summary: It is time to take a second look at Greek Wines - Skouras Moschofilero is an excellent white for any occassion
review/text: Being a both frequent Amazon reviewer and a frequent white wine drinker, I felt compelled to submit my humble opinion on this excellent Greek offering. Most of my wine consumption entails lower to moderately priced sauvignon blanc and medium priced champagne. Lately, however, I have been exploring Greek products to help bolster their export economy in any small way I could. Fortunately, I stumbled across this lovely bottle.<br /><br />The first "Greek table wines" that I ingested seemed to be mislabeled industrial solvent. Then, a local wine merchant aggressively suggested this bottle of 2010 Skouras Moschofilero. I was very pleased with his recommendation.<br /><br />What is particularly enjoyable about this wine is the initial taste of sweetness similar to that of a desert wine but that doesn't linger. It makes an excellent choice for any casual get together. Supplant your typical pinot grigrio or sauvignon blanc to impress friends and family with your creativity. This moscholifero will complement a light summer meal or just make a nice option for guests at your next party.

review/summary: a tasty snack for your little one
review/text: My daughter has egg, milk, and peanut allergies. My 22 month old still enjoys it from time to time as a treat when we are out. This is a good snack/distraction to have on hand when you are running errands or on the go, instead of eating dry cereal or what not. If they can suck from a straw, then they can eat it directly from the pouch.<br /><br />There is also a product that attaches onto any of these products. The Boon spoon attachment is handy for younger babies, but not a necessity.<br /><br />I didn't experience any sour taste, so it might be sign that the reviewers who stated so theirs might have gone bad.
