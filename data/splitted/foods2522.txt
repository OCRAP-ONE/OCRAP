review/text: We're on our 4th case from Amazon. This latest one really isn't very good. I've cooked about 4-5 boxes trying to cook the pasta right. The spaghetti noodles just keep getting skinnier and skinnier until they are like angel hair.<br /><br />Will probably just end up taking the seasoning/parmesan packets out and pitch the pasta.<br /><br />Two stars for the seasoning and -3 for the crappy pasta.

review/text: The Tangy aspect is no more.  I ate this all the time growing up and I thought it was off the market.  When I found this I was excited, I bought the case and shared it with all my siblings.  Since we all grew up on it we were excited to find it.  Unfortunately the unanimous decision was that the sauce was not the tangy sauce that it used to be.  It's sad.  It tastes ok but we won't be buying any more...

review/summary: A Different Take on a Classic
review/text: As someone who did not grow up eating this stuff, I admit that a lot of its praise is lost on my family.  It really is quite a different beast than what most people would consider Spaghetti.  It tastes more like a pungent herbal version that is as to spaghetti what a veggie burger is to a hamburger.  In a similar fashion, opinions are going to vary widely and I've found that many people recoil a bit because they simply weren't expecting it to taste so different.  That doesn't make it bad, by any means, but I would suggest that you don't start with a whole case.  Personally, I find a simple dinner made with store brand sauce and noodles vastly preferable.

review/summary: How did this get a 5 star rating?
review/text: Due to the large amount of five star ratings this product got I decided to buy a case, even though I'd never tried it before.  I figured that all those people couldn't be wrong, could they?  Well, I am not a food snob by any means, but let me just say that even my husband, who will eat practically ANY pasta, did not like this.  The noodles were very...squishy.  Almost gelatinous.  The sauce was poorly seasoned and harsh tasting.  It was almost like pairing bad canned sauce with Top Ramen noodles.  I was expecting this meal to be not of the highest quality, but still good in the way that fast food is good - cheap, yet yummy and addicting.  It was cheap all right, but unfortunately the yummy part got left out.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was that it wasn't so bad that we couldn't eat it.  However, I definitely wouldn't make it again.  I think the only people who will like this are those who were raised on it.  If you've never tried this before, you probably won't like it.

review/summary: Wish I could give it a zero!
review/text: After reading so many positive reviews on this product I decided to give it a try.  I never ate this as a child so I have no attachment emotional or otherwise to it.  Luckily, my local Kroger still sells this item so I didn't have to buy a case of it to give it a try.  I have to say I was really disappointed in the flavor.  It wasn't really a tangy flavor but rather a strong and somewhat bitter flavor.  The noodles were very sub par as well.  My husband and children wouldn't eat this and I ended up making sandwiches for dinner.  I would not recommend this product unless you have that nostalgia for it.  Please don't order a case of this thinking you're going to love it only to end up hating it like other people on here have.  See if you can find one box and give it a try.

review/summary: Do not flame me.  This is so very yucky!  I am not kidding.
review/text: Can you stand a differing opinion?  Please read this.<br /><br />Recently, I bought the box of 24 of this product.  I thought it might be good food to have in case of emergency.  However, this is the first time I've bought something on Amazon that had universal praise, but I disagree with it.  I am wondering what kind of Italian food these people are used to?  Do they actually know how Italian sauce is supposed to taste?  Because this is not tasty!  Actually, I found it rather yucky, and three other members of my family confirmed the same result.<br /><br />I followed the directions & made this exactly as was stated on the box.  The sauce you end up with has an undefinable, very strong taste to it.  Looking at the ingredients on the side of the box, it just lists "spices" so I don't know what that bad taste is really coming from.<br /><br />Also, the Kraft brand spaghetti is not very good quality.  The only good thing about it is that you don't have to snap it to make it fit in the pot.  Other than that, the spaghetti is tasteless, fat, limp and bland.  Thank goodness there is not very much of that spaghetti (it only serves 4 from the box).<br /><br />On top of not liking this product, I found that the actual components are overpriced.  You should just buy some excellent pasta, such as Barilla spaghetti that doesn't cost very much and makes alot more servings.  Add to that any jar of pre-made sauce.  In a side by side taste test, I bet the Barilla+jarred sauce would taste way better.<br /><br />For now, I'm going to use up the awful Kraft noodles as well as I can, and chuck the "flavor" packets into the garbage.

review/text: This is the spaghetti that I remember from my childhood.  Mom made this.  So it goes without saying that I have special feelings concerning this spaghetti dinner.  I'm not sure what it is that gives this it's special flavor, but it is incredible, must be something in the flavor packet.  So, when I'm feeling homesick, I make up a big plate of this spaghetti.  And I can't have it without making garlic toast and serving with a huge ice cold glass of milk.  I have a terrible fear that it will be discontinued one day!  Woe is me if they do that.

(Here is my suggestion.)<br /><br />  Brown a lb of ground beef, add 2- eight ounce cans of tomato sauce, and the packet of spices. simmer slowly.<br /><br /> During this time the spaghetti should be in boiling water along with an added lb. of uncooked spaghetti.<br /><br />  Ladle the finished sauce on top of a dish of spaghetti and it will  treat you to a delicious spaghetti dinner that will beat most restaurants.

review/text: I ate Kraft Italian Spaghetti many, many times when was growing up in the '60s, and continued to enjoy it for many years until sometime in the '80s, where it started to disappear from the supermarket shelves. I bought it because I just loved the tangy sauce; the noodles were never anything special.  I was pleased to find out that it was available from Amazon, and bought 36 boxes.  However, now that I have tried several boxes, I have to say that the taste is not the same.  I've made the sauce alternating with tomato sauce and tomato paste, and the sauce is just too sweet.  If anyone has an idea of what I can do to get the original "tang" back, I would greatly appreciate it.

review/text: This has been my favorite meal since I was a kid. It used to be regularly stocked in Giant Food, but they have gotten rid of all the products I love. Luckily you can still buy this great spaghetti dinner online. Kraft Spaghetti Tangy Italian makes a quick, great tasting meal for 2 - 4 people. We like to serve ours with the sauce seperate from the pasta. And if you would like it a little less tangy, don't put all of the flavor packet in. We usually leave out about a teaspoon of the packet. I could eat this stuff everynight!  Give it a try, it tastes like no other spaghetti out there.

review/text: Okay it's not really fair to compare this to a from scratch Italian style spaghetti dinner... but for a humble boxed dinner it is wonderfully quick to prepare.  Adding a splash of olive oil and a shake of dried oregano enlivens the flavor. Like for so many reviewers here, this was a childhood favorite of mine. However my husband never had it as a kid and now he says that this simple spaghetti dinner is fantastic!  Be careful not to over cook the noodles. They taste best as slightly al dente.  This Kraft Spaghetti, is seldom found at major grocery stores, so I hope Amazon keeps stocking it.

review/text: When I was a young mother, I fed my 3 little girls and husband Kraft Classic Italian Spaghetti Dinner every time we went camping. We had little money and even though my Italian Heritage should have made me want to make my own spaghetti sauce, there was something about the Kraft Spaghetti dinner that made me prefer it over the homemade dinner. I think it was the spice packet that gave it that peculiar tangy "Italian" flavor. Our small budget was not hurt by the modest price and even my borther and sister sat down to a meal of this stange Italian pasta dinner and asked for more. I just ordered a case of it from Amazon because it is so hard to find. We still love it and have to have it every so often.<br />Carol Utah

My family has felt delicious-spaghetti-deprived for the past couple of years even with trying numerous jarred brands and homemade recipes.  There is nothing like it!

review/text: This is THE ONLY Spaghetti I eat!<br /><br />This stuff is so good.  I make it a little different though.<br /><br />I brown the ground beef, drain it, then add the sauce and spices directly to the meat and let it cook with it.  I also mix about half a packet of the parmesean into the sauce as well.<br /><br />Also, leftovers taste even better!!!

review/summary: Kraft Noodle Classics, Tangy Italian Spaghetti Dinner
review/text: My cousin from Germany brought over the German Kraft Spaghetti kits and I thought they tasted better than anything we have here in this country.  I tried getting them here or ordering on-line without success.<br /><br />Finally I decided to take a chance with the American variety which apparently is only available on-line.  To my surprise, it was pretty close to the same thing, and fantastic, I might add.  The only difference is the German Kraft box had the tomato paste included.  The American Kraft box says to add tomato paste & water or tomato sauce.  In a way, that's even better...and it is less expensive.

review/text: Kraft convenience products have been a staple in our pantry for many years.  When the two supermarkets that we frequent stopped, one at a time, carring Kraft Tangy Spagetti Kit we were bummed.  Then we found it avaliable at Amazon, at a cost comparable to the lower price of the two stores. It answered the need.  Now the grandchildren are enjoying the good, tangy blend of delicious italian spices as the two generations before them do.  Convenient, good value and good taste.  The product is always fresh.

review/text: Kraft Tangy Italian Spaghetti mix has been a favorite of my family for over 40 years. For over a year it has been impossible to find in any of my local (and not so local) grocery stores. So it was a great day when I found this mix available on Amazon.com.<br /><br />I mix Kraft with another dry mix & have been doing so ever since an early experiment went very well. When Kraft was not available I tried many other brands, but the whole family said it "just wasn't the same". Now we can have the spaghetti we have loved for years and eat happy.<br /><br />That the mix contains the sauce spices, spaghetti and even the Parmesan cheese makes it easy and quick to put together a meal.<br /><br />It is a matter of taste and this is the taste we crave.<br /><br />Thank you.

review/text: We really like this spaghetti and I was so glad to find it here because it has disappeared from local stores.  The only thing I am not pleased about is the Best Before date on them.  Mine arrived on Aug 31 and the Best When Used By date on the packages is Nov 14.  That's 12 weeks to eat 24 boxes.  We like it, but eating it twice a week to use before that date is a bit extreme, even for us.  I'll have to share some with family and friends, and the local food bank because the family will kill me if I fix it twice a week.  But I would die full of good spaghetti.  :). Taking off 1 star for being close dated.

review/summary: A "cult food" classic!
review/text: I just love this stuff - and have been eating it since the mid `60's. I remember the red box "American Style" spaghetti too. I think it had powdered cheese in it to make it milder, and I remember that my younger sister always liked it while I liked the spicy. There was also a Kraft spaghetti dinner that came with meat sauce in a can, also very good. All three are "cult food" classics for me. I haven't seen the latter two in at least 10 years, since the local Piggly Wiggly closed. The spicy is getting rare too; now gone from the local WalMart. Not a good sign, but glad to see it's available here.<br /><br />As an update, I wanted to report that I found a Facebook page lobbying to bring back the "Spaghetti with Meat Sauce Dinner." Here it is for all you "cult foodies" like me out there:[...]

I make a mean homemade spaghetti and meatballs, but sometimes I just crave this and can't find it in any local groceries anymore.  Albertson's used to carry it, but now all of our Albertson's are gone.  Served with canned green beans and halibut fish fillets (ok, so I had to upgrade from the fish sticks of old)...I know, crazy, but so good!

review/text: I don't know why grocery stores always feel the need to stop carrying this classic dinner in a box. This is as popular as Kraft mac and cheese. The box, tomato sauce, a pound of burger and about 1/2 cup of red of wine added makes the best spaghetti in such little time. When they stopped carrying it for a while at my local grocery store I tried different packages, homemade and bottled sauces and I could never get anything as good as the Kraft mix. My family loves when I make it.

review/text: the 'kraft tangy italian style dinner,' while similar, isn't the same as it was in the 70's. at first, i thought it was just me, but, after reading some reviews here; i see others feel the same way. still, it is a good meal for under a couple of bucks, and there is very little cleanup after a day at work. years ago, the flavor packet could be stretched to make two dinners, but now, you must use it all at once. i find that the main difference. i'm still giving it 5 stars for value, and the parmesan cheese still melts nicely on the product. i find it hard to come by, though, hardly any one carries it anymore. the only reason i can see is that it detracts from their more expensive jar sauce sales. i finally found it again at, 'dollar general,' of all places. i hope they continue to stock it!

review/summary: An old favorite
review/text: I started buying Kraft Tangy Italian Spaghetti when my son was in college.  He looked forward to his weekly care packages with his spaghetti in it.  This was his favorite meal; cheap, easy and very good.  Just add tom. paste and water; When he could afford it he would add some meat.  In 10 minutes he had a great meal.  He is now 44 years old and still enjoys it.  Since moving to FL I can't find Kraft Tangy Italian Spaghetti in any of the stores. Amazon had it and I bought a case.  We just had it for dinner tonight. It is very good!

review/summary: Kraft Tangy Spaghetti Denner
review/text: Kraft Tangy Italian Spaghetti Dinner has been a mainstay in my family for many years.  I have tried other spaghetti sauces, but only used it once and it was right back to this product.  Because we are snowbirders, I find it difficult to find this product, so I decided to see if I could order it somewhere.  When typing in Kraft Tangy Italian Spaghetti Dinner in my Yahoo search engine, Amazon appeared and there it was.  I was so grateful, I ordered an entire case as I had spent over an hour going to all the grocery stores in the area to find it.  I add hamburger, onion and celery and have a main course for supper that my kids, grandkids and great-grandchildren love.  Thank you Kraft.

review/summary: Excellent Spaghetti Diiner for those in a hurry or anytime
review/text: We have been using this product for many years and have never been disappointed.  However, fewer and fewer local grocery stores are carrying this product.  This was very disappointing until I found out about the automatic delivery feature of Amazon.com.  Now we could care less about buying this in a grocery store because we receive a full case of this product every 6 months at the best price ever.  The tangy flavor of the spaghetti sauce is great and is even hard to beat with my homemade italian recipe.  The spice package you get with this boxed dinner is just the right combination of italian herbs and spices.

It's got the best tasting sauce EVER.  My last few boxes are actually nearly a year past the expiration date but it still tastes fine.  I hope Amazon continues to carry this.

review/summary: My favorite white chocolate
review/text: This is the best white chocolate I have found.  Sometimes, I just got to go white instead of dark (my usual).  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it isn't low glycemic enough for me to eat regularly since it has maltitol, and because I haven't tried as many white chocolates as I have dark chocolates.

review/text: I'd tried the LaNouba brand white chocolate bars before these, and the LaNoubas are supposedly uber-fine Belgian chocolate. But there was NO comparison in taste or texture between the 'fine Belgian chocolate" and the Ross white chocolate bars! Ross bars actually taste good. I also tried the milk chocolate Ross bars (vs. the LaNouba brand) and again, Ross won out hands down. Price was better, taste was better. If you are looking for value and taste, go with Ross.

review/summary: Great Tasting Diabetic Friendly White Chocolate Bar! Highly Recommended!
review/text: Ross diabetic friendly No Sugar Added White Chocolate Bars are great tasting and are very close to "real" candy bars. With 180 Calories and 5 Net Carbs, these are a great treat to curb your sweet tooth cravings brought on when your insensitive family is eating candy in front of you.<br /><br />I do have to eat these in moderation since too much Maltitol does cause me some "gastric distress".<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/summary: If you miss white chocolate on your low carb diet....
review/text: I have been looking for a good tasting white chocolate I could have on my low carb diet.  It is easy to find sugarless dark and milk chocolate locally, but white chocolate is another matter.  These bars are quite good.  They are about 5 effective carbs per bar though, the bars are not large they do hit the spot if you really miss white chocolate as I did.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: The taste of the product was pretty good it did taste like white chocolate but it tasted a bit more like that vanilla almond bark stuff it sometimes left a weird coating like feeling in my mouth. But overall for 5 net carbs the taste was really good. I've ordered the milk chocolate ones to try next. Mine were packed in an insulated bag with a reusable freezer pack so they weren't melted when they arrived but I put them in the freezer to make them firmer. I also had no stomach problems with one bar. I guess it just depends on how sensitive a person it to the malitol.  I'd recommend this product for anyone watching their carbs or sugar intake. The bars were bigger and in my opinion more satisfying then those Atkins bars they sell in the store, but that's just my opinion, I haven't tried too many of the Atkins bars. But for the time being I prefer these to the ones I have tried.

review/text: Yummy.  You cannot tell the difference in taste between "real" white chocolate and these low-carb treats.  But...The difference is these don't cause me to crave more sugar, like regular chocolate does.  So, I can eat one bar, forget about them, then have another a few days later when it occurs to me that I'd like a treat.<br /><br />I bought one box which lasted me 3 months; I just bought 2 more boxes, so I should be good until next January.

review/summary: Make it taste even better!
review/text: My kids love their Macaroni & Cheese but one day all we had was a generic brand.  They didn't eat it all that well (Kraft really is the best) so I decided to try to make it a little better for them.  Follow the recipe on the box with a couple exceptions.  Put one slice of velveeta chees in while melting the butter (I melt the butter while the noodles are draining so as to melt the butter and velveeta faster) and add 1/3 cup milk.  What you'll have is a less expensive version of the really creamy macaroni and cheese that Kraft sells for a lot more money.  By adding extra milk and cheese they're even getting more calcium.  My kids love it when I throw in hot dogs and even peas so feel free to throw in other things since it's so cheesy (the extra cheesy sauce will take things like peas that kids don't normally eat and make them taste good).  Give it a try and see what you and/or your kids think!

review/text: Lean Treats are a great product and my two english bulldogs devour them every time they are treated!!  I found them on sale at my Vet's office and bought a pack and I've continued to purchase them online for great value every since.  One of my bullies has to take daily medication and these make it easy to hide the pills inside and she just gobbles it up, no problem.  They are not only yummy in my dogs opinion, but they are truly Lean.  I've tried other lite or low-fat products on the market to keep my bullies fit and nothing has worked like these.  I always noticed weight gain no matter what product and these don't cause that for my dogs.  I'll continue to purchase Lean Treats and hope they never go away.  It's always great when you finally find a wonderful, reliable and quality product and hope it will be sold for the long haul.  Let's hope, because I'll keep ordering!!

review/text: We switched to these after my vet said my dog had high cholesterol & wanted to put him on medication.  These are little soft chews that my dog loves.  We stuff them in his kong ball and he will chew forever to get it out.  After being on this and diet dog food for a few months, our dog's cholesterol was closer to normal.  My neighbor tried them with her dog and it loved them so much, she asked me to get her some the next time I was at the vet's office, so I came online and ordered a case for us and everyone we know that has a dog.  I am sure they will get eaten very quickly!
