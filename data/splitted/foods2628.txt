review/summary: If Amazon could have sent the right product, it would have been good.
review/text: These are excellent chips, except Amazon couldn't get the order straight and twice sent me cases of Red Hot Blues. Great. What does a single person do with 2 cases of already flavored chips? Yep, give them away. I liked the Red Hots, but wanted these with no seasoning (I make my own salsas) for every day and Amazon just couldn't pull it off. The case was even clearly labelled.  Go figure. Amazon did refund my money fully.

review/summary: a fine product from a savvy company
review/text: Be warned that these chips have NO SALT.  That is what I want, so that I can taste the interesting flavor of this unique variety of corn, unadulterated by unhealthful sodium.  The blue color is not a artificial chemical coloring, but healthful anthocyanins.  This corn is a great source of these compounds, which have been demonstrated to have immense and healthful benefits.  Highly recommended, especially for corn lovers!<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus<br />[...]

review/summary: Vegan Natural [Organic Corn] Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. Kosher Parve. Made with organic yellow corn; canola, safflower, or sunflower oils [all organic and/or conventional]; and sea salt. Great choice for those who like corn chips like Fr*tos. Great with bean burritos, enchiladas, soups, and even as a crunchy salad topping. Like most chips, highly caloric. 170 calories per 1oz/28g serving. Use as a garnish, repackage in smaller snack bag sizes, or eat in moderation.

review/summary: Great Flavour - Excellent Find!
review/text: I've been hunting for snacks which taste good, but don't have BHA,BHT,EDTA,hydrogenated (partially or otherwise) fats, artificial colors and a myriad of other ingredients which are known to be "bad" yet they are still allowed in food production.  I can't express how excited I was to find these!  My husband is a very picky snacker - he loves these.  My children one which likes spicy and one which doesn't (third is too young for this kind of food) love these.  They are great straight out of the bag or as an accompaniment to a sandwich or bowl of chili.<br /><br />I initially found these in our local PCC and Whole Foods.  I'm glad Amazon carries them.  Price wise I'm saving at least $1.00/bag by buying through Amazon instead of from my grocery.

review/text: Tortilla chip in existence. If you like popcorn and tortilla chips but are interested in eating healthy,this chip gives you all three! The blue corn version is equally good if not better! If you think the guiltless one's are good,these will leave you speechless. There is NO comparison. The only problem I see is that garden of eatin has a line of about 15 different tortilla chips. The only one's baked are these two. Those that make the decisions what to shelve need to start giving these chips their due. Something so delicious and actually good for you needs the proper availability to succeed. Try these baked chips. If you have taste buds,they'll be happy.

review/summary: Love them, but wish they had a 6 pack instead of a 12.
review/text: I love the salt free blue corn chips. When I lived in Florida I ate salsa/hummus/blue corn chips for lunch pretty much every day. There was so much salt between the salsa and hummus, that I really didn't need it on the chips. When I first started with the salted chips, my mouth would be on fire after a few chips. The salt free was an awesome find, and I love that amazon sold them in bulk so that I could afford them.<br /><br />Only con is because I'm single/live alone, and going through 12 bags of tortilla chips before they expire is a challenge (natural products tend to expire quicker). I ate them after the "best by" date, they just ended up being a little stale. No fault of the product, just my own issue to deal with. Still 5 star product!

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I have always loved these chips and buy them often at the grocery store. Since Amazon offered them at a very good price I purchased a case, However, upon receipt I was disappointed and immediately notified the company (Garden of Eatin). They were not as good as the ones in the grocery store (they seemed to be darker and greasier)and I wondered if they were old. The expiration date indicates they are fine. I do not dislike them, though I love the store ones, and have decided to keep them. Salsa can fix anything. However, I will not purchase them again in bulk from Amazon. My biggest disappointment has been that the company never responded to my email.

review/summary: two small issues
review/text: I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these "MINI WHITE ROUNDS" and an equivalent order of "TATO SKINS".  The "skins" arrived unbroken while the "rounds" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the "skins" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the "rounds" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a "tostitos" or "mission" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the "Tato Skins" certainly did!  Maybe they'll be better when I dip them in some quacamole or something.

review/text: A marvelous crunchy treat, acceptable to even the most finicky toddler. Wonderful with salsa and sour cream, hot spinach and artichoke dip, and many more ways. If they used a different fat to cook them (the label currently says safflower and/or canola) they would be perfect. I love that they're free of GMO but I'd be even happier if they contained a healthy fat such as lard or coconut oil, or even olive or sunflower or grapeseed would be an improvement.

review/text: These are great chips!  I also like the red chips.  UNFORTUNATELY, Amazon ships these out in the vendor boxes which are very flimsy.  All of the chips end up broken.<br /><br />It's so funny -- everything else Amazon sends out is in rugged Amazon boxes -- sometimes the item inside is in the vendor box so you get double protection.  The items that should be double boxed (chips) don't get any protection at all and they are the most fragile.

review/text: My wife says that she can taste a mild sweetness from the blue corn -- I cannot.  Honestly they taste like regular corn chips to me.  The difference is that without a thick coating of salt attached, like essentially ever other chip on the market, I _can_ taste what's on top of my chips.<br /><br />Me, I like 'em with nacho cheese.  It's amazing to not have my lips searing from the salt as I eat hot dipping dressings.<br /><br />I wish I didn't have to buy a case at a time to get the good price, but the bags are fairly small, so you'll go through them fast at a party.

review/summary: Garden of FakeLime Detergenty Flavors and other Natural Flavors
review/text: I'm just going to say it: These CHIPS Taste like DETERGENT.<br /><br />Given that Garden of Eatin' blue corn, and red hots chips are my favorite of all time, it's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as "Chili & Lime".<br /><br />First of all, where's the chili? I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is "NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili. Coat those suckers with maybe 1/2 to 100% of the rate used for redhotblues.

review/summary: BEST baked chips ever!!
review/text: I had these chips on vacation and could never find them in any of my local stores including Whole Foods.  On a whim, I checked Amazon and was so happy to find that they sold them and they were a pretty good price too.  I was little worried about ordering chips online, the expiration date, shipping and how we were going to get through all of them.<br /><br />No worries!  Only 3 bags left  - my husband and I love them.  The shipping was A+, with double boxes and air bags.  The chip bags are puffed up and you will need clippers or scissors to open it.  I don't mind because I think that's why they are so good and crunchy, not like the Guiltless Gourmet ones that taste like stale cardboard.  We make it to the bottom of the bag with very few crushed chips at all.  The fresh by date was 3 1/2 months from my date of purchase.<br /><br />The best part of all is the taste and nutritional quality of these chips.  One serving has 120 calories with 3 grams fat, 3 grams protein and 3 grams of fiber which for chips is pretty good.  Yes, they are not like blue corn regular chips with twice the fat, but they are the best ones out there that are baked.<br /><br />I will definitely be reordering again!

review/summary: Garden Of Eatin' Blue Corn Chips
review/text: Corn chips, you can't have just one and therein lies the problem. The crunch, the salt, the flavors are so addictive.  Not only are they perfect by themselves but they are a vessel for deliciousness. Whether its guacamole, salsa, refried beans, hummus, you name it.  My favorite these days has to be blue corn chips, they have a deeper almost burnt flavor to them which I can't seem to get enough of.  Garden Of Eatin' blue corn chips are my chips of choice.  They have the crunch, the salt, the flavor, not to mention they are organic and GMO free. I got so excited when they went on sale that I ended up crushing some of the bags as I grabbed them.  I feel bad for the person who got the bag of crumbs, I have to contain myself next time around.

I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to "clean" before eating.  I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own.

But you folks might want to revisit your packaging.  You know how you grab a bag of chips at the top and pull apart the seam to open?<br />These seams have been sealed with titanium.  And if you eventually manage to pull it apart, of course the rest of the bag is made of the same far too easily ripped all the way down the side to hope to reseal the bag, as every other manufacturer uses today.

review/summary: not correc size
review/text: This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.

review/summary: Very  old stock
review/text: I received this product from Amazon who sent me the oldest stock possible. The postage alone cost about $60 and i ordered about $60 worth of the product. Most of the items I received were only 2 to 3 weeks from their sell by date and are rancid or stale. It was a huge disappointment receiving these and I will never order this product again.Neither will i recommend anyone buy this product from Amazon. It makes you think that Garden of Eatin products are not good but I have bought them before at my local grocery store and they tasted great,so I know for sure that the problem is with Amazon stock. For me, thats $120 wasted as returns are apparently not possible. very very disappointed with Amazon.com, because i shop at Amazon.co.uk very often and have rarely been disappointed and even when there have been disappointments, they are immediately rectified. Amazon.com does not allow refunds or returns on this item, so beware!

Tulsi, also known as "holy basil" is a delicious herb, related to the basil plant, but tastes more along the lines of mint. It is an antioxidant, and a powerful tea to detox, or just to relax. Plus it tastes great. No caffeine, so drink it day or night.

review/text: I'm an avid tea fan, and I like a good solid black tea.  I'll drink an occasional herb tea, and I'm aware of all the healthy reasons why one should drink herbal tissanes, but I still enjoy my black tea.  That's where this tea comes in.  It's a nice hearty breakfast black, but as is their signature, it also contains holy basil, with all it's wonderful health benefits.  Now it doesn't taste overly herbal at all.  It's a nice blend, and it handles sweetener (honey is my choice) and milk or creamer well (I use a good soy creamer...).  And it's organic!  I'll take that everywhere I can.  And the tea is harvested consciously! YAY!  This is a feel good all around tea!

review/text: My Dad introduced us to Skinner's years ago. We are now three generations and extended family fans of this cereal. We have some dissenters in the family and I am controversial because I prefer my skinner's on the soggy side as that allows all the flavor to emerge from the cereal. One look at the nutritional value of Skinner's versus Post or Kellogg's on the basis of sodium (skinner's very low) and fiber (skinner's very high) will tell you to give this a try. I admit the taste is maybe not for everybody as it isn't sweet but I have always found it to have a raisin in every bite and we enjoy it.

review/text: When I was growing up we used to buy Skinner's Raisin Bran in the little market in Clyde, Kansas.  I never forgot the wholesome flakes that still retained the shape of the wheat, and was delighted to find this cereal again.  I devoured the first six boxes I ordered from Amazon and couldn't wait to order then next six.  Unfortunately this product has not always been available, and when it has been available it has not always been as good a price as when I first ordered it.<br /><br />If you are having trouble finding the Skinner's Raisin Bran, I suggest looking into Erewhon Raisin Bran. It is exactly the same as Skinner's in an organic version. Both are manufactured by U. S. Mills, and the Erewhon box even talks about it being made just like the original raisin bran. They don't mention the Skinner's brand by name, but when you taste it there will be no doubt what raisin bran they're talking about!

review/summary: Delicious whole-grain porridge cereal
review/text: This cereal has a delicious whole-grain flavor and makes for a great healthier cream-of-wheat option, as it's made up of 100% whole-grain coarsely-ground wheat and brown rice, plus additional wheat bran.  This shows in the nutritional info as well, as 1/3 cup (33g) has 7g fiber (28% daily value) in only 23g total carbs (9% daily value) and 5g protein as well.<br /><br />Here's how I make it for a quick and hearty hot breakfast:  I take roughly a heaping 1/3 cup of it, a small handful (~1 tbsp) of some dried fruit (i.e., raisins or the like), a pinch of salt, a tiny bit of sweetener (honey, agave, real maple syrup, etc.), and a cup of any type of milk (my favorite for this purpose being my homemade almond milk) and nuke it for 3 minutes.  It comes out a bit loose but after sitting for another few minutes, it thickens up considerably and is also now cool enough to actually eat.<br /><br />Typically what I'll do is prepare the above in the bowl I'll be eating it out of (which takes all of around a minute to put together total), put it in the microwave to cook and go about continuing with my morning routine.  When I get back to it roughly 10 minutes later, all it needs is a quick stir and it's ready.  Yum!

review/summary: Good price compared to local stores. Love this coffee.
review/text: The store where I was buying the 2 lb. bags of Starbucks whole bean French roast coffee has discontinued selling whole beans, and I don't like to buy pre-ground coffees. The price per lb. at Amazon is almost as good as the price where I was buying it.<br /><br />Not sure why, but usually the 2 lb. bags of these beans were much better quality and taste than the 1 lb. bags of the same type (French roast) of Starbuck beans elsewhere, including at the local Starbucks and in grocery stores. Also this 2.5 lb. bag I just received recently is very good compared to the smaller bags.<br /><br />After a couple weeks of drinking some terrible Starbucks beans in the 1 lb. bags I was happy to get this large bag with good beans again.<br /><br />I'm giving it a 4 instead of 5 because coffee beans vary a great deal, and this bag has some tasty beans in it - but when I order another bag, who knows how that will taste....Could be from a different plantation, soil, climate, etc...I've experienced long spells of one terrible bag of beans after another - and no, it was not my taste buds. Other times I got very good to excellent bags of beans for long spells....

I got two of these 40oz bag less than a month ago for $18.99/each with prime's free shipping. That was a great deal.

But, if this is the best price you can find, you'll be thrilled with the product.

review/text: I thought this was a good value.  Starbucks has a name, stores, and the price was good.  I should have saved my money and bought the equal amount of Dunkin Donuts brand whole beans cause it is so much better than this stuff.<br /><br />This coffee lacks even subtle character of Diner coffee.<br /><br />It is harsh on the pallet and coats your tongue.  French roast?  I never tasted anything this bad in France.  This is more akin to the coffee you may buy in India.

I find it disappointing as being able to make specialty drinks is the whole reason I chose to purchase the Vue over a K-cup brewer. I hope the other flavors are better because I won't buy this one again. Bummer.

review/text: I love Oreos and I love chocolate so I took a chance on the chocolate creme Oreos.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed with how they tasted - the chocolate flavor was just strong enough to throw off the taste of the cookie, if you can understand that.  I would personally stick with the standard Oreo double stuff cookies - the creme does not compete as much for a place in the taste and it is a nicer compliment to the overall flavors.<br /><br />I won't be getting this variety again, but I definitely will still get Oreos!

I have no idea if it has any scientific bases to it or not, I only know it worked for me, I have not had a gout attack since starting it, would not be without it. I am not one who normally believes in natural remedies, so this is just an added bonus to a great tasting treat. I also found it much cheaper on Amazon than at The Health Food Store.

review/summary: Cool stuff! Pretty presentation
review/text: This was a cool basket of goodies. I wasn't sure what to expect honestly. There were two little packets of specialty flavor coffee, two different kinds of cheese sticks & cheese biscuits, a packet of cheese & spice dip, a box of spaghetti, chocolates, box of garlic crackers, and a can of cheese stuffed olives from Spain. Most everything seemed to be from Italy or Spain. The basket is a standard little woven job with cute leather handles. (It'll make a fine container for the trick or treat candies)<br /><br />The chocolate covered cherries were very rich and indulgent. The hazelnut mousse chocolates were extremely rich, everyone agreed though that the cherries were the best of the two items. The cheese straws were cheesy and not overly crunchy - tasted fresh. My father is an olive nut - he can tell the difference in types of olives under all circumstances and there is always some type of olive on his table. The can of cheese stuffed olives was good - he liked them, I find olives a tad salty normally, but these were quite nice. We haven't had a chance to make the coffee yet or cook the pasta, but if the other items are any indication, there won't be anything yucky in this basket. I would feel good sending one of these as a gift to family or friends.

review/summary: Excellent Gift Basket
review/text: We were really please with the Taste of Italy Gift Basket. There were a lot of great things to taste in here. Several of the items in the case have become household favorites and we've tracked down where to purchase them individually. My girlfriend is also giving one or two of these baskets to relatives for the holidays - that's how much she was impressed by this.<br /><br />So what comes in your gift basket?<br /><br />1) 7oz Bellentani Rustice Tuscan Style Salami. This is excellent. It's a very strong herb covered salami that tastes great and is sure to knock you for a loop the first time you taste it.<br /><br />2) 3.5oz Italian Herb cheese spread. Also excellent. It's great with crackers and compliments the salami wonderfully.<br /><br />3) 7.05oz Sandamiri Garlic Crostini crackers. These are amazing. The good news is you can purchase Sandamiri products on Amazon. The bad news is they don't have this flavor.<br /><br />4) 3.5oz Water Wheel wafer crackers. These were okay. Just your standard superthin wafer crackers.<br /><br />5) 5.29oz Spread Sticks. These long hard breadsticks are great with the cheese spread or mustards.<br /><br />6) .9oz Dolcetto Chocolate Pastry cookies. These are tasty and the chocolate is quite strong for such a little amount. Very happy with these.<br /><br />7) 2.4oz Crespo pitted green olives with herbs and garlic. These are TERRIBLE. I love olives and these things made me gag. My girlfriend had to spit hers out. These are nasty. I can not emphasize that enough. This is the one bad bit of the basket.<br /><br />8) .85 Caffe' Vergnano 1882 Biscoffee. I don't eat things with caffine in them (allergy) so I can't personally comment on these. High marks from those that ate them though.<br /><br />9) 1.3oz Amaretto Royale coffee. See 8) above.<br /><br />10) 1.2oz dark chocolate covered cherries. Who doesn't love these?<br /><br />11)  1 oz Hazelnut chocolates. Delicious. There are only two so they'll go fast.<br /><br />12) 1.6oz Honees. These are honey candies. I liked them but my girlfriend thought they tasted like very strong cough drops.<br /><br />Overall, you get a lot in the basket and aside from the olives (go with a can or fresh instead of these things), it's all quite delicious. I'd definitely recommend this to people who want to give a nice food basket to friends or family.

review/text: If you're sending this gift basket to a friend in the mail, you'll be pleased to know that the presentation is lovely and it comes well assembled and wrapped so it makes a great first impression as a gift.<br /><br />As a gift receiver, I'd be thrilled to get this gift basket (the bread sticks and the chocolate straw wafer things were my absolute favorites) but as the gift sender, I might be a little bit disappointed in the price paid.  The items in the basket can be pretty easily replicated if you have a Cost Plus or other market in your area that sells imported products, and you can probably get all the items in the basket together for a lower price than what it's sold on here for Amazon.<br /><br />It probably would have been nicer to include a hard cheese wheel to go with the salami instead of the processed cheese tub that was included, but I've received those cheese tubs in other gift baskets before.  My husband, who loves olives, could not eat the stuffed olives that were included in the bagged set.  On the other hand, my mom - who doesn't care one way or another about olives, enjoyed the stuffed olives.<br /><br />In any case, I think that if you're trying to send a last minute gift to a far away friend or acquaintance, this gift basket would be a great option if you don't have the time or resources to put one together yourself. It's more affordable than some other gift basket options I've seen, but gift baskets in general seem to be a bit overpriced to me anyway.

review/summary: Seems a bit pricey for what you get
review/text: While I enjoyed the contents of this basket, I must admit that the current price of almost $60 seems a bit steep to me.  The basket contains quite literally "a taste" of some of the items as some of the items only contain two or three pieces.  For instance, there are only two chocolate covered cherries and only three hazelnut chocolates.  There is a single brewing of coffee that comes in a box that is four times the size of the actual bag of coffee contained therein.  There is a tiny box of coffee cookies that contained four very small cookies.  And there is a box of Dolcetto dark chocolate pastry cookies that contain only three tiny sticks.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />There were some items that contained what I consider to be a more "normal" amount.  For instance, there was a pack of Honees candies.  I liked the Honees so much that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E7SYKM">I bought a whole case.</a>  There was a box of garlic crackers that I thoroughly enjoyed.  There was a box of olive-oil breadsticks that, at first I thought were just okay, but it turned out that I really liked them.  I also liked the thin water wheel crackers.<br /><br />There is a rosemary herb encrusted salami that is very strong - the jury is still out on that one.<br /><br />I haven't tried the olives or the cheese spread.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the basket, but I can't help but think that it is overpriced for what you are receiving - especially with some of the items being so small.  If the basket was about $35, I would rate it higher.  For $60 you could put together your own basket of goodies that would put this to shame.

review/text: Hard to recommend this from a value standpoint. While the construction and quality is OK the quantity of the product inside the boxes is so small (such as 2 of the hazelnut chocolates) that they come off as free trials more than anything else. If we really breakdown the elements that are fully size you get crackers, wheat thins, bread sticks, salami and olives. None of them are particular stand-outs where you would say 'wow this is amazing'... just pretty standard grocery store mass-market, shelf stable, long dated expiration type products.  This is worth about half the price that it is currently selling for.

review/text: My husband and I were thrilled to find this hard to find drink mix!It can be used to make a low calorie frosty cocktail using half tub (packet) of Crystal Light,2 cups diet ginger ale. 1/2 cup vodka and ice as desired in blender. Not a very sweet drink...just refreshing!

review/summary: BEST BDRINK
review/text: I LOVE THIS PRODUCT FOR ITS TASTE AND THIRST QUENCHING ABILITIES. I ONLY USE 1 CONTAINER FOR A GALLON NOT THE 2 THAT THEY RECOMMEND, IT TASTES TOO SWEET USING 2. THE PRICE THAT I PAID WAS GOOD AND IT ARRIVED QUICK. THE BEST THING IS IT IS REALLY HARD TO FIND THIS FLAVOR ON THE STORE SHELVES ANYMORE, SO THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO ORDER!
