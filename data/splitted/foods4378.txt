review/summary: Big fish, and lots of not so spicy sauce
review/text: The fish are quite big, about 3 in the can.<br />The vertebrae  are big enough to pop when you bite into them, a little unpleasant...<br />Lots of thin sauce, which is not very spicy.<br /><br />I was hoping for a tin that was ready to eat, but for me these need some more prep work, cleaning the spine out and adding more sauce.

review/summary: Disgusting
review/text: I purchased Chicken of the sea sardines in mustard and in hot sauce. I didnt buy them from amazon but from a local store. I hated them so much I had to come on here and write a review. They are absolutely terrible. The sauce is thin and doesnt really taste like anything at all.  There are scales all though the sauce and on the sardines. The scales get in your teeth and all through your mouth. I felt like I was biting into an uncooked trout. Don't buy these.<br />Sticking with the Beach Cliff brand sardines, much better.

review/summary: Ate the entire can just to write this review...
review/text: This item tasted like what I expect a carp would taste.  Typically purchase King Oscar products, but wife believes in garage sale items infested with bed bugs and thinks the overflowing sale bins are great deal items - not items that don't sell for a reason.  The "hot sauce" is nothing but hot and I've had fewer bones in Shad.  There were a total of 3 "sardines", or whatever these were, in the can.  I kept an unopened bottle of Devil's Springs Vodka on hand for years for extreme remedy purposes and used it to get rid of the bio-solid waste taste this product left behind.  Funny - country of origin in USA, but is product of Thailand...  must be snakehead..?? Truly believe this is not Bluefin tuna so it's at least not contaminated with radiation from Japan.  NOT WORTH A BUCK A CAN!!!!!!  NOTE: **** had to rate this 1 Star after shooting for ZERO stars got the message "Please rate this item."  I honestly believe Jessica Simpson had something when she said she thought Chicken of the Sea was Chicken...  This one's not really fish!!

review/text: I just wanted to let buyers know that santa and snowman flavors are buttermilk flavor. It is just the packing that is different. The price was lower for this packing. I bought a case and the expiration date is 18 months away so I have no problem saving some money and getting the same great quality and flavor as the standard buttermilk mix. I appreciate amazon havong products like this as part of prime for us west coasters that grew up in the east and miss east coast products!

review/text: This makes a delicious salsa. I have never made salsa before. I do, however, love to eat it. We belong to a CSA this year, so we have a TON of tomatoes. I found Mrs. Wages at a local Mennonite market and figured I would give it a try. I'm so happy I did. I found the "Hot" salsa to be plenty spicy for my palate. I think it will definitely be too spicy for my son... maybe not my daughter. I did add one small chili pepper (which it probably didn't need), a chopped onion, and a bit of fresh cilantro. I don't think it needed any of these extra ingredients, but it does taste great if you have them on hand.

review/summary: Exceptional wasabi product
review/text: I've tried many types of wasabi from many different brands.  Aside from freshly-grated, pure wasabi I have to say that Eden's wasabi powder ranks pretty close behind at 2nd place.  The flavor is intensely hot, yet somewhat adjustable since you can add more or less water.  Eden's products are always very high quality and this one is no exception.  I highly recommended it to wasabi-lovers out there.  There are no unnecessary preservatives, colors, additives or filler ingredients like in so many other conventional brands.<br /><br />Wasabi powder is very easy to store; just make sure it's in an airtight container or bag and keep in a cool, dry place.  Whenever you need some, add some hot water to the desired spice intensity and wait a few minutes.  Give it a try!

review/text: My little dog was the fussiest eater you ever saw.  One day my daughter and I went to a pet expo where animals were welcome and we brought Martini, my chihuahua. They were handing out samples and she practically inhaled it. We used to have to put various enticements on her food to get her to eat, and even then it was hit and miss. We don't have to put anything on this, just break up the freeze-dried patties and she loves it! It's so exciting to see her eat now!  She doesn't like the frozen/raw version of this food, however. I have only tried the chicken so far.

review/summary: Not just for dogs!
review/text: This freeze dried raw food is incredibly good for your dog and your CAT!  Yup, my local store suggested it for my cats too as either a treat or meal.  I do make raw meat patties for the cats already (freeze and dethaw as needed) but this is a great way to work with that diet or simply supplement your pet's present diet.  Raw food is SO much better for dogs/cats.  Smaller, no stink stool, better behavior, better skin/coat, and generally this is what they used to eat before we decided dry or cooked/canned was better! Both my dogs and cats absolutely LOVE this product and honestly, the price is pretty good for the organic - real meat food you are getting for you animal. Another great thing - on this diet, they eat less as they are getting more of what their bodies need - so don't worry about cost as over a week you will notice a decrease in diet and an increase in satisfaction with less.  Both cats lost a bit of weight too (both slightly overweight)!

review/summary: Delicious for dogs...not cheap...practical for toy, small dogs
review/text: I had went to a dog bakery and the employee had given a sample to my pup and she absolutely LOVED it!!!! These patties are made especially for small dogs or toy dogs because it is a meal replacement for them and since there so small in size they only need like a patty a day practically. I took a star away because people recommend it as a snack or a supplement to add it to your dog food. My pup is gonna be about 50 lbs so I knew that I couldn't really have an income to supply her with feeding Stella & Chewys as a whole meal. So I decided for dinner, I would cut pieces of part of a patty into her food as a little appetizer. Turns out, she loved the patties so much. She thought her food was too bland when it was without it. I decided to try to cut her off. Like I said, dogs love it but it can get very costly.

review/text: That being said...I haven't actually tried it, but it is so great for her that despite the cost I will continue to buy it.  My dog is 45lbs, definitely not a small dog, but I use this to supplement her food and I will never go back.  Bella is a rescue and was passed around a lot before I got her, she definitely was not well socialized and definitely not well-fed (whatever was available at the dollar store).  She easily gets stomach issues from almost nothing, even with grain-free foods.  This food really has made her more consistent...in a way I really feel creepy talking about.  In addition to that, she is picky.  She used to actually not eat some days, now she actually sits waiting out side the kitchen every meal time.  There are some differences between the flavors...as another review has mentioned, the chicken is flaky...crumbles easily.  Great for me since I break it up and mix it in with her food.  The duck is definitely moister and softer.  The beef is the most solid and compact.  Bella loves the taste of all of them, and all help her digestion.  We are both happy happy.

review/summary: Winning the picky little dog battle...
review/text: My boyfriend who works at small chain pet store turned me on to Stella and Chewy's. I can't say enough good things! I have a Dachshund with skin and weight problems. We were on the hunt for a grain free food he wouldn't turn his long nose up at and were just coming up short in all respects. He hated everything! One of the first suggestions was Stella and Chewy's but I shrugged it off because to me, the price was much too high (my dog food experience up until this point sadly was one of frugality rather than what you're actually feeding the dog). After buying bag after bag of things he didn't even want to taste, I caved and we bought him a small bag of these patties. He wolfed it down! I was shocked!<br /><br />The better result came when my mother's Chihuahua/Min-Pin mix got herself a taste. This dog weighs next to nothing because she refuses to eat all but one flavor of a certain cheap-o canned food, and even then you have to specially prepare it before she even thinks about wanting to eat. I gave her a small piece and it was gone before I knew it! She hoarked down a whole patty in seconds. Amazing!<br /><br />If you have a picky eater, especially a picky small breed dog, this is well worth the investment. Five stars! :D

review/summary: My dog loves them but EXPENSIVE
review/text: My dog is a mini Australian Shepherd and is pretty picky about his food.  He first tried these freeze dried Chicken Patties at his doggy daycare.  He ate it so quickly that I looked them up on Amazon and bought them!!  The package recommends feeding a few to several patties a day for your dog. At that rate, I'd be broke!  I give him maybe one or two every other day.  They are super light and powdery.  Many of mine broke during shipment so the whole bottom third of my package is in powdered bits. My dog takes the patties out of his dish one by one and carries them over to the carpet and proceeds to bite them into tiny pieces before eating them.  Luckily it's a powder so it vaccuums easily off of the carpet.  And even though it seems like they might be smelly, they aren't. They don't smell like much of anything.  The point is, it's a healthy and well made food that my dogs loves.  I feel really good about feeing him these patties.  I will have to try the other flavors as well.  I just wish they weren't so expensive and were a little more sturdy during shipment so I wouldn't receive a third of a bag of freeze dried powder!

review/summary: Excellent food
review/text: I have a 5 pound Yorkie who loves Stella & Chewy's. The first year of her life I had to make her food for her because she refused kibble. After researching the dog food industry I have decided my dog is smarter than most people concerning what is good for her. Most kibble dog foods have had the nutrition baked out of them. I do not consider grain or white potatoes to be dog food although that is what makes up most of the dog food products you find these days. Since meat cannot sit in a bag on a shelf for months at a time the dog food industry has replaced what a dog would normally eat with grain and other nutritionally inferior foods. Our dogs are now suffering from the same diseases as humans due to the poor ingredients put in our dog's food. Diabetes, obesity, rotten teeth, cancer are all taking our pet's lives due to "stuff" placed in most kibbles. They have to put various forms of glucose in the foods to entice dogs to eat the stuff. Stella & Chewy's is a superior blend of all natural grass fed animals and other high quality organic products. My dog loves it. I rehydrate it with either water or chicken broth. If your dog does not drink a lot of water you really need to rehydrate the food before giving to the dog. I wish the frozen S&C's was available in my area as I would love to be able to feed it to my dog. It was originally made for small dogs but I guess you could feed it to a larger dog though it would be quite expensive.<br />AMAZON: This is the first time I have ordered this food though you. I am very disappointed in the shipping. It took 4 days longer than estimated to get here. Don't know if I will order it here again or not.

review/summary: My picky dog loves it
review/text: I decided to switch my dog's food to a grain-free diet. I came upon this at a local pet food store. They gave him a small sample of the duck flavor and he gobbled it right up. I ended up getting the chicken flavor. This is my third bag. I give him about 1/4-1/3 of the disks and sprinkle it on his dog grain-free dry dog food. He won't eat his kibbles without this. I just wish it smelt better.

review/summary: four paws up from two picky lap dogs!
review/text: My two tiny toy poodles love Stella and Chewy's chicken patties! I soak them in hot water for a few minutes before feeding it to them and they not only eat the patties but lap up all the juice too. They love fresh raw meat but are pretty picky about eating anything dried or crunchy, so this is a great compromise. I don't have to worry about refrigeration or using it all up before it goes bad and they love it as much as fresh. The only thing I don't like is the price.

review/summary: Crack For Dogs!
review/text: I breed and show Biewer Terriers and this truly is the best product out there. My little dogs will eat this like nothing else, I feed it to nursing mothers as morning and evening meal and have not had any problems with runny stools since, even with other food for inbetween meals. The pickiest eaters will woof this down and look for more, works well to crumble over dry kibble. It is pricey, but if you are not feeding it alone it is not such a problem. All my dogs that eat even a half a patty per day have firm, oderless stools!<br />This is the best, and the dogs love it, and I have tried many brands.

They both are healthy, lean and have really smooth and silky feeling hair.  Don't know how much can be credited to their diet, but I'm sure it helps.  Only con is these are a bit costly, but worth it.

review/summary: Dogs love it
review/text: I have two cavalier king charles spaniels who are pretty picky eaters.  The only way to get them to eat is to mix this freeze dried in with it.  Personally I take the time to mix in a little hot water to reconstitute it and then mix it with kibble.  My wife just sprinkles some on dried.  Either way they love it.  It's a little pricey, but we only use half a disk at a time to mix in with kibble.  So it lasts.<br /><br />While I have found these for slightly cheaper in the local pet store.  It actually comes out less on Amazon with no sales tax

review/summary: Dogs Luv These but they Crumble into Nothing!
review/text: I bought these due to the wonderful reviews. My 3 rating is based on my dogs who seem to love these little patties/treats. But upon receiving the bag the majority of these soft cookie size patties had crumbled into nothing but tasty dust on the bottom of the bag. No handing out this as a treat or as a food patty you would have to pour the crumbs into a bowl. The packaging or shipping would need to change to keep these in their original round cookie/patty shape. Due to the condition of these patties I would not order these again (sorry doggies). When you have a few dogs like I do you need them in the correct measured size so you know each dog gets the same/right amount. They will be missed though!

review/summary: My dog LOVES Stella and Chewy's TOO BAD IT DIDN'T GET HERE
review/text: My dog loves Stella and Chewy's dried dog food.  One patty mixed with a little of her good canned food and she is very happy and her digestive system is working perfectly.  Ever since we found Stella and Chewy's her eating habits have improved dramatically.  I have ordered the food from Amazon since we first found it in an out of town dog food store.  HOWEVER - this shipment was sent via ONTRAC.  A service I had never heard of.  I am an Amazon Prime member so when I didn't receive it I tracked it - it said it was delivered to my door at a time when I know I was home.  I called the customer service who tracked down the driver and evidently apologized because he delivered it to an entirely different building at an entirely different address.  How is that even possible to enter in that you left it at a door successfully but it was not even in the same building?  So I guess they are going to try and find it - in the meantime, my dog is out of food...Very disappointed.

review/text: These are large crunchy yummy peanuts. It's freshly sealed from the factory. The fact that they are unsalted makes them very addicting. You can be watching tv and not realize just how many of them you have gobbled up. I have tried other flavors from Virginia Diner. For me the seasoned nuts initially tastes really good but after awhile the strong flavors are too much. With these unsalted nuts I can keep eating and not get sick of it. With all the sodium we ingest everyday these unsalted nuts makes a real healthy and delicious snack.

review/summary: One of the best natural sweeteners available. Just IDEAL.
review/text: If you are looking for a natural sweetener, and stevia changes the taste, or has a mild bitter aftertaste to you, than xylitol can be a good option. And among the many xylitol options IDEAL is the best for our family. Other xylitol products may cause stomach discomfort (which is not uncommon for sugar alcohols in general). But not with IDEAL Sweetener. Perhaps it is in how the manufacturer sources the xylitol, or how it is manufactured and mixed with a bit of sucralose? We've not experienced stomach discomfort, and we use it just like sugar. Xylitol has none of the bad effects of sugar. For example, sugar has a glycemic index of anywhere from 85 to 100, but xylitol only 7; an important benefit for people with diabetes. Also, xylitol helps protect teeth. While sugar does the opposite. Xylitol is found in fruits and vegetables, and even made by the human body; thus the claim to it being natural. (99% natural for the IDEAL brand, since the manufacturer does in fact add a bit of sucralose. Perhaps this is why, in our experience, the IDEAL version of xylitol is far better tolerated than the 100% xylitol brands at health stores.)<br /><br />We have a 6 year old at home, and we don't want her exposed to too much sugar, or even artificial sweeteners. There are several stevia brands now that could have been good natural sweetener options for us, but a few of us in the household detect a mild bitter aftertaste. So xylitol is our "go-to" natural sweetener, and IDEAL is our favorite brand. It goes with almost anything that needs sugar, and cooks/bakes well. (Depending on the cooking/baking project, sometimes 100% substitution works, but more often, not. Thus, when cooking/baking with it, try first at 75% sugar + 25% IDEAL. If successful, see if 66/33 works, and then 50/50% sugar and IDEAL. And so on. For most of our cooking/baking projects, most can't tell that we substituted up to half of the sugar with IDEAL.)  Our next project is to try making ice-cream with 100% IDEAL instead of sugar.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that Stop & Shop does not carry it. And A&P used to, but stopped making it available. So, we buy from Amazon.

You get 6 boxes of 20, so that is 60 servings for me (2 bags at a time) for the 13.95 (subscribe and save) these cups used to be. If I want the tea a bit stronger, I will remove the tea bags after brewing from the my k-cup and throw them in my mug. Let is steep a bit longer and it is wonderful!

review/summary: Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai
review/text: What I was expecting was a chai tea similar to one I find in popular coffee houses: a spiced tea infused with cream and sugar. This tea smells wonderful but the taste when you are drinking it is very plain to me. Also it is missing the cream and sugar elements so it has none of the flavor and body of a coffee house chai. I've also tried three other chais from Timothy's, Bigelow and Gloria Jean's and had the same reaction to them all during my side by side taste test. The K-cup chais are simply not the same as the coffee house chais. To approximate the coffee house chai you'll need to add your own cream/milk and sugar/honey and give it a little shake.

review/summary: Delicious with 5 spice aromas, not full of sugar and cream
review/text: This India Spice Chai while brewing fills the whole room with wonderful aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves almost like the Chinese 5 spice blend.  There is no added sugar or cream so if you want that go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030GQHXA">Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups for Keurig Coffee Machines - 16 Pack</a>.  Those k-cups which are delicious as well have the cream that many expect in a chai tea.  This particular brand of Celestial Seasonings is just tea.  You can add what you want after the fact.  I've not had any trouble with the packaging, nor having the tops flop off while brewing.  This is just a nice cup of spiced tea.  It's not peppery and won't offend or be too spicy for most. I really like it and highly recommend.

review/summary: Converted me to tea over coffee - it's that good
review/text: Before buying my Keurig brewer, I never really like black tea.  I would drink herbal tea from tme to time but black tea always seemed too bitter.  After trying Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast Tea, I was instantly converted.  There is no bitter taste and it's so much less acidic than coffee and therefore much easier on my stomach.  It has a mild, slightly fruity taste that is perfect with breakfast or really anytime of day.  I've tried it plain and with a bit of milk and sugar as well.  I honestly have become more of a tea drinker than coffee drinker since trying this delicious tea.

Another plus is that you don't have to wait for the tea to brew. Using the 10oz setting is just right for me. If you want a stronger brew then use the 8oz setting.

review/summary: Where's The Cardamon?  Prepare for the Cloveaload!
review/text: If the only chai you know is from a chai flavored latte at a coffee shop, this might be a good tea for you.  If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is "this is NOT chai tea."  There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea.  As it is, it should be called "spicy clove tea."  This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices.  It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves.  I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region.  Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors.  Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision.  I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically.<br /><br />I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a "traditional" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand.  For all the people out there who know what Indo-Pakistani Chai tastes like, I'll be reviewing each of the "chai" K-Cups according to how they resemble the original.

review/text: I love this chai, and it makes a much better chai latte than I've tried in any k-cup before.  To be clear, this doesn't come with powdered milk or cream, so you have to add your own cream in order to make it a latte.<br /><br />I have disliked all of the pre-mixed latte k-cups I've tried because of a combination of artificial sweatener (which they all seem to insist on adding) and the powdered creamer (which is worse than fresh).  I add my own sugar and cream to this chai, and it is delicious!<br /><br />When I tried this without cream and sugar, it tasted slightly heavy on the clove.  With the cream and sugar, though, I don't have any complaints.

review/text: I love Chai Tea.  I don't even put sugar or honey in my Chai Tea.  This was just not right.  Tasted burnt out of the keurig and the cloves are overpowering.  No amount of honey and milk could make this right for me.  I am suffering through my 24-pack and may just throw it out.  Very disappointing.  I've had this brand/flavor in the bags before (although not recently) and liked it just fine.  Even bought it multiple times.  Not sure what is not working right with the k-cup formula.

You may not prefer as weak a tea, but that can be solved by running it through only once.  It has a clean, refreshing flavor.

And I am a tea drinker who doesn't add sugar/honey because I enjoy the natural sweetening properties in the actual herbs. But this herbal tea is missing something, especially with a name like 'Authentic Green Tea'. It's pretty disappointing for the price of these things, but I'll continue to drink it until I run out.
