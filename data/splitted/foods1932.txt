review/summary: Barry Farms TVP-Yummy!!!!!
review/text: I've looked everywhere online for the original TVP that I used to buy from ADM's country store in Decatur, IL. In these folks, I finally found it. They're courteous, very friendly and are just good people. They ship quickly and package in ways that make sense. ie: I bought 25lbs. They shipped in 5-5lb. bags instead of one 25lb. bag. I won't be buying from anyone else and I use a lot of this product as I'm primarily vegetarian. If I could give it 10 stars, I would!

review/summary: Just branching into TVP, SOY, protein alternatives
review/text: Like my title suggests, I've just started to try different alternatives to animal protein.  I really liked this product.  It was easy to prepare by soaking in water for 15 minutes then frying it up with some spices, tomato, onion and garlic in a bit of olive oil.  The texture is close to ground beef though not exactly the same, just a bit softer.  I think I like this product the best of the various protein replacements I've tried.  My only complaint and it's minor, is that it tastes slightly sweet.  Perhaps more experimentation with it and I can figure out how to offset this.  In any event I'll be ordering more!

review/summary: TVP Newbie Placing 2nd Order
review/text: I absolutely love this stuff. Like another said, there is a slightly sweet taste to it. I have gotten around that with sauteed onions and garlic! Of course, I am just beginning to learn how to use the stuff.<br />The first dish I made with TVP was Minestrone. It was fabulous!<br />The next dish was Vegan Tacos. This stuff makes the best Sloppy Joes too.<br />So, if you're an omnivore playing around with the idea of turning vegan, you might want to give TVP a try. Also - Barry Farms shipped my order FAST. I will continue to shop from them.

review/text: This product is just wonderful for vegetarian cooking. It stores easily, cooks very quickly and is inexpensive!  When I'm ready to use it, I just throw it in to boiling water with tomato and season it - I used it with pasta, make a sour cream sauce to put over about anything to give added body and protein to a meal.  It's flavor is quite unobtrusive, so you can season to your own liking.<br /><br />I stumbled across this by accident and am so glad as this is the only place I have found this and have ordered repeatedly.

review/text: This is good stuff.  If you are considering a move towards a more vegetarian diet, this is s good place to start. I have mixed this with ground turkey breast to make burgers<br />and you can't tell at all, plus it bulks up when it absorbs moisture, so you save money versus buying it wet/frozen.<br />It also makes very good vegetarian sloppy joes.  Just cook your other ingredients separately, and add this at the last minute.  Because it's minced, it will cook very quickly just<br />soaking in the hot sauce.

review/summary: A most delicious absinthe, and higly recommended!
review/text: K&uuml;bler is a Swiss blanche absinthe, which means than when poured on a glass, you will not see the classic and sought-after green color, but just crystal clear liquid, like water or vodka.  It does louche, of course, to a beautiful milky pearl color.<br /><br />I drank it with one sugar cube and 4-5 parts of water.  As always, the main flavor is anise, with a hint of bitterness in the after taste, but subtle and enjoyable.  Although I can not taste any other flavors, I would say that it provides a refreshing experience.  Depending on your taste, you may skip the sugar and enjoy it anyway.<br /><br />I would recommend it for beginners better than the Lucid, although more experienced drinkers may find it lacks complexity.  In any case, it will remain one of my favorites.<br /><br />P.S. I refuse to discuss thujone content and other non-sense and myths in my reviews.  If you are interested in thujone, go eat sage and forget absinthe altogether.

I would suggest using a glass tea pot made for flowering teas to brew the balls in though cause they could get bitter using a glass tea mug. i give this product an A+++++

review/summary: Magical Blooming Tea Flowers Are a Delight for the Senses
review/text: My friend took me to a wonderful Thai restaurant for my birthday and the blooming tea flowers were a delightful suprise! Having no idea they even existed, they infused [pun intended] the meal with magic that was reminiscent of the beautiful blooming shell flowers of my childhood about 60 years ago.<br /><br />What fun to be able to offer friends a magical triple delight of seeing the tea flowers bloom, smelling the tea, then tasting the delicious Jasmine tea. This reminded me of the tea ceremony in Japan, but with much less effort on my part. In my usual ADD way, I didn't read the instructions and placed glass teapot with chosen tea flower, which is like a loose ball, into the microwave. It still was delightful in slowly unfolding. Heating the water first and pouring it in is even better.<br /><br />A delight to more than one sense. How magical! I wholeheartedly recommend this product and thank them for providing something new under the sun to this elder as an easy way to nurture and surprise guests.

review/text: The flavors are mellow and sublime, the way a good natural green tea should be. They are not teabags after all. The blooms are also lovely to watch, sometimes they need a minute to settle down to the bottom of the pot. In my experience i like to pour the water in first, then add the blooms later, and let them bloom and sink, and slowly release the gentle flavors. These are wonderful, and the package is wonderful as well, they would make a great gift. I plan on giving out several during Christmas. Good luck!

review/summary: Tea is flavorless with small bloom
review/text: I purchased a glass teapot for my mother at Christmas and decided to buy this package of blooming teas for her as well.  I had previously purchased a single blooming tea at my upscale grocer and when I tried it I found it to be delicious and aromatic and the blossom was large and beautiful.  I saved two of the packets of this Grosche tea to be served after Christmas dinner with dessert and split the other package between my Mother and Mother in law because it was sold out at Amazon.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!  The tea  was flavorless and the blossom like a pitiable piece of seaweed! Not at all like the one I purchased at my Grocer in Buffalo NY or the fine ones I tried when I was in Paris last spring.  I was a bit embarrassed at this lacklustre showing and I would not purchase from this Grosche company again.  I think the concept of these blooming teas is fabulous, I would certainly buy it in a minute from my large upscale grocer in Buffalo NY or in Paris at one of those fantastic tea shops. However I don't recommend the tea from these people.

We used to buy from the manufacturer in Wisconsin and they'd mail it to us in California.  But they kinda consistently made mistakes on our order.  They make some other flavors but they aren't great to us.<br />We also tried several waffle makes including a professional model from Wells like you see in restaurants.  The best we found was a $300 Kitchen Aid from William Sonoma.  It makes two huge round waffles at once!<br />With a lot of mixes (especially pancakes) I like to doctor them up a bit by changing ingredients.  But this is perfect.<br />WE LOVE WAFFLES!!!

review/text: I just checked my package of waffle mix and it has ZERO trans fat! The other reviewer is mistaken. We have tried all the varieties of mixes and find this brand to be the easiest and tastiest mix available. All that you add is water and a little melted butter to prepare the batter. Sometimes we will add a mashed banana and/or pecans to the batter for variety. We might also sprinkle a few chocolate chips over the waffle after it comes out steaming hot from the waffle iron (they melt and add a delicious chocolate surprise to the waffle). We have delicious Belgian waffles every Sunday. The box comes with two individual pouches and each pouch makes approximately 3 Belgian waffles. We use the Waring brand Double Belgian Waffle Iron (makes 2 waffles at one time)and have had great success.

review/text: We just bought our first Belgian waffle maker and based on other reviewers bought this mix.  It is delicious.  The waffles cooked up crisp on the ouside with a light, fluffly texture on the inside.  Great flavor & everyone raved about them.  I am not a cook that typically takes the easy road and prefer homemade recipes and avoid box mixes.  But I'm sold on this and am hard pressed to think I'm going to take the time to make them from scratch.  Just be forewarned that based on the amount of batter your individual iron requires per waffle you may not get as many waffles as the box states you'll get.  Two pouches are supposed to make about 10 waffles and we got about half that.

review/text: I've used the Classique Belgian Waffle mix for many years. My son lives in TX and I live in OH. Unfortunately, we were not able to get together for Christmas. It was a rough holiday without him, and not being able to make some of his favorite childhood meals was sad. So, the first thing I thought of was Belgian Waffles, and this mix was his and our families favorite. Luckily for me I found the Classique Belgian Waffle mix in a 6 pack along with a waffle maker on Amazon.com. He was thrilled, it was like giving him a hug from miles away. These waffles are tasty, the texture is sublime... just the best. Try the Classique Belgian Waffle Mix for yourself, and you won't be disappointed...who knows, maybe, you can start your own family tradition. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5YQG">Classique Belgian Waffle Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Best mix I've tried!
review/text: I've tried a variety of mixes for my waffle makers (yes, I have a number--what can I say).<br /><br />This is by far my favorite.  Produces very tasty but also very light waffles.  These are on the sweeter side, but not crazy sweet.<br /><br />This is particularly good for Belgian waffles, since they are a bit larger than average waffles.  With other mixes many people don't finish the whole waffle since it is too heavy.  These always disappear.  Many positive comments from several tasters/waffle consumers.

review/summary: Waffle snob
review/text: This mix is easy to use and totally delicious. If you err in making a batch, let it be adding just a touch of extra butter. If you skimp on the butter, the waffle may stick a tad to your maker, but it will still be delicious! My kids always looked forward to traveling to make the waffles on the breakfast buffet, but this time we made waffles and didn't eat them-this mix has spoiled the kids and made us all waffle snobs! :P  Try it, I am sure you and your family will love it. We have added nuts and also chocolate chips so far for variety and both were yummy. Fresh blueberries are coming soon...can't wait! :D

review/text: I ordered this mix when I bought a new waffle maker for my daughter. At first I thought it pricey but decided to get the item anyway. To everyone's amazement, 6 boxes came!  Each box had 2 envelops.  We had a grand time making the waffles. They were so easy and delicious. Extra batter could be saved in the refrigerator for use even the next day.  Expiration for use of the dry mix posed no problem.  Now this is a daily staple for the household.

review/summary: Just Outstanding!!!
review/text: To mirror all the other reviews, I am not one who cooks from mixes but this is too good and easy to pass up. I have tried other mixes this season, hoping to find a good one to give with the Kitchen Aid double waffle iron I gave out to several folks on my Christmas list. This was by far the best! Other mixes like Golden Malted are good but make a regular waffle. This mix makes a really good Belgian Waffle! While not quite yeast risen quality, I have to say I just don't care because the waffles this mix makes are so good and only take a matter of minutes to make rather than hours. The fact that all you need is the mix and some butter and water is great because you can keep the mix on hand for emergency breakfast cravings when you find yourself low on eggs and don't feel like going out. I guess my only complaint would be that the whole box of mix only makes four waffles in my big round double waffle machine but that is minor. I don't plan on looking any further for other mixes, this one is it for me.

review/text: I live in a small town.  Years ago one store carried Classique Belgian Waffle Mix and my family loved the Belgian waffles we made from this mix.  It was definitely better than other popular brands on the shelf.  When our neighborhood store stopped carrying this product, I tried a few other mixes and than decided to order it online.  Several cases later, I still do.

review/summary: for dessert only -- WARNING!
review/text: This made a really nice, crisp waffle -- nothing to add but water and a bit of melted butter. However, I planned to serve it as a platform for a savory, creamed entree. It didn't work -- it's loaded with sugar and vanilla. I'll use it up for desserts and for breakfast, but I'll go back to making waffles from scratch for dinner. Because it's not versatile enough (and because I bought 6 BOXES), I'm giving it only 3 stars. In truth, it should have 5 for sweet toppings and 1 (or 0) for savory.

review/summary: My Favorite Chewy Fruit Snack
review/text: I've been enjoying this delicious snack for years and never grow tired of them. My two favorite snacks might be concord grape and mixed fruit; I don't have a least favorite. In my last bag of mixed fruit I observed mostly red pieces with a few orange and only one concord grape piece. The different flavored snacks are colored and shaped differently, many with pebbly texture on top to simulate berries. They are soft and chewy, but not overly so. Their sweetness is satisfyingly pleasing but not as intense as one might experience with a piece of candy. The tastes vary with the flavors, but in the bag of mixed fruit one doesn't distinguish distinctive flavors.<br /><br />I've always thought of the Welch's Fruit Snacks as a guilt free treat, like eating a piece of fruit. Well, that's not quite true. The first ingredient, you'll notice, is fruit juice, not real fruit, followed by corn syrup and sugar. The fruit part, actually a fruit puree, follows the sweeteners and the modified corn starch. Also in these fruit snacks are artificial colorings like red #40, yellow #5, and blue #1. Some of these colors can trigger hyperactivity in children. Yellow 5 used to set my daughter off like an overload of caffeine.<br /><br />The Welch's Fruit Snacks are not sticky to the touch like some other fruit based snacks. At work I sometimes share a bag or two with students who universally enjoy them as much as I do.<br /><br />Overall this is a tasty, nutritious snack, maybe a bit heavy handed with the sweeteners. It's a good snack to eat with one hand while turning pages or grading papers with the other. It can be eaten all by yourself or shared with others.<br />I like the ingredient list than that of other similar snacks such as Fruit Roll-ups. For what it's worth, Fruit Roll-ups have 373 calories per 100 grams of snack. Welch's Fruit Snacks have 325 calories per 100 grams.

This mix is a steal when you can find it for fifty cents an ounce or less. The only negative thing I can say is, I would personally prefer fewer almonds because they're harder than the other nuts. But that doesn't stop me from gobbling up almost a pound of this mix a week sometimes!

Anyways, I love this sauce.  It provides a ton of heat, but never too much.  It's got a very roasty flavor.  The cayenne isn't as pronounced as in other sauces that specialize in it (Frank's, Louisiana, etc.), but it's still got a nice peppery taste.  The smokeyness is great, and it packs a nice punch.  I use it on everything.

review/summary: It's hot, but the taste is just nasty
review/text: Looking at the ingredients, this looked promising, and I heard some good reviews so I decided to try it.<br /><br />I first tried a little on a spoon.  It has some kick to it, but it's not overpoweringly hot by my standards either.  Don't get me wrong, this stuff is hot, but it's on the milder side of the extract hot sauce spectrum.  I would say it's about 100k-150k on the scoville chart based on my experiences with hot sauces.  It's also thin, so you can use a good amount, and spread it around.<br /><br />However where they went wrong is the taste of this stuff is pretty bad.  The overall consistency and flavor of this sauce is in tube with Louisiana style hot sauces, with the exception of the first and most noticeable taste which is extract.  For those who don't know, extract tastes more or less like battery acid, or so people who have tried both claim (and I have no reason not to believe them).  The second flavor that hit me was vinegar, even though vinegar isn't even the first ingredient.  Third was salt, and fourth was cayenne.  There is no noticeable habanero or ghost pepper flavor in this sauce.  If they used more ghost peppers and less extract, this sauce could have a lot of potential.  Also, the salt is completely unnecessary, as the taste is overwhelmingly bitter -- perhaps a small amount of sugar could have been enough of a bandaid to save this hot sauce.<br /><br />In short, I ended up pouring it down the drain.  If it was the only hot sauce I had, it was passable, but I have an entire shelf full of hot sauces that I look forward to using, and I simply do not have room to store a bottle that I will never use.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  If you want a great tasting Louisiana style hot sauce, try Crazy Uncle Jester's Louisiana Firestorm.  That sauce does have extract but you you taste primarily the serranos and hababeros and the flavor of the extract can be easily overlooked.  Their hotter version, Spontaneous Combusion is also much better -- that has much less pepper flavor, and more extract but it ends up tasting just like Crystal Louisiana style hot sauce, only much hotter.  Red Ghost might have slightly more heat, but you can simply use more Louisiana Firestorm or Spontaneous Combusion and have a lot greater flavor.

review/text: I bought this service with the hopes that Ms. Deen herself or at least one of her employees would come out to my house and offer the service indicated in the title, a "Butt massage". No, I don't expect anything erotic or anything like that before someone makes such an accusation, I simply put have a sore tush and from time to time need someone to massage it so it's not so tender and painful. Now, did I get said service! No! I instead got two 2.77 ounce shakers of spices. Well, I decided that maybe this isn't the butt of some joke and figured maybe the idea was to "self serve" if you will, to massage my own behind with the spices. I did this, and I developed a rash the next day! I will NOT order this product again.<br /><br />The spices would probably be okay on pork though. But I don't own any livestock to massage so for me that is moot.<br /><br />As an aside, this is a cut and paste of my review of a different size of Ms. Deen's butt massage service, thus the reference to two 2.77 ounce shakers.  Even so, given the only difference is the size of the jar my comments there should apply to here fine.

No "filler" flavors like I expected. I will certainly be buying again. And if you are buying a Kurig for someone for Christmas, I Highly recommend you purchase this for them as well!!

review/summary: Great variety
review/text: I bought this sample pack of K-cups to go along with the coffee maker I bought my sister for Christmas.  I received a great variety of flavors, a few duplicates, but overall a very nice selection.  I saw some of the other reviews complained they only received a couple of different flavors.  I can not say the same.  There were at least a dozen different flavors in the box.<br /><br />The packaging isn't so great.  The cups just come loose in the brown box they are shipped in.  Not a big deal if you are buying them for your own use, however I will have to find a small box to gift these in.  But the price was right and they arrived in 3 days - overall I am pleased.

Nothing was expired and everything has plenty of time left until expiration.  I highly recommend this!!

review/text: This variety kcup pack was pretty good. My fav out of them was the Green Mountain brand. I'm not really a chocolate coffee lover, but I tried them all. I've noticed since I got a Kuerig machine for my birthday I have been practically using it almost every day taking my coffee to work. Pump the breaks, I needed to slow down, I started getting the caffeine headaches. So now I'm down to maybe taking the coffee in twice a week and everything has been fine. I would order again and maybe next time some decaf. Good variety.

review/text: I guess I was also disappointed in the assortment.  The info suggests you get 34 different coffees, so that you don't have to "buy 34 different boxes."  But as others reported, I got repeats in the assortment, as many as 4 of the exact same product.  Furthermore, I received two CIDER products, which are not coffee.  I don't want cider, I want coffee.  And thanks for the iced coffee sample, which I also don't drink.  Lastly, the k-cups are packaged in a brown paper bag which is stapled shut.  I'm guessing that doesn't even meet food packaging codes; there's no product info, ingredient info or nutrition info.

So it's not as if they are in danger of being crushed in the mail. I got a couple of teas mixed in, which is fine with me. I got some great choices. It seems a bit random,  but that is ok with me because I am a new user and wanted to try lots of choices and see what I really liked.<br /><br />So far I really love the Pumpkin Spice, the Cinnamon Roll and Supreme Vanilla. I would order again.

review/text: I bought this variety pack to go with the coffee maker I purchased as a gift.  The variety I received was decent, but I was totally unimpressed when I opened the shipping box and found that the coffee assortment was packaged in an unlabeled plain, brown paper bag.  I thought the assortment would at least come in a labeled box of some sort, but the samples were literally stuffed in a bag with the top bunched up like a brown bag lunch.  It literally looked like someone just tossed 24 random coffees in a bag and threw it in a shipping box.  Not the best for gift-giving.  I thought that was pretty tacky, especially for the price.

That is, if you believe that regular Donut House, Folgers Lively Columbian, regular Caribou Blend, Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade, Newman's Own Extra Bold and Green Mountain Nantucket Blend are different types of coffee. They're not. (I also got five other cups in four actual varieties: pumpkin spice, gingberbread, french toast and eggnog.) Furthermore, they all came shipped loose in a box. Again, no special packaging was promised, but I was planning this as a gift, and it's not really gift-appropriate.<br /><br />All in all, I have no grounds to stand on in asking for a refund, but this isn't what I was expecting.

To be fair I ordered this item one more time and the exact same thing happened.  I also contacted customer service and they sent me out another 24 pack and once again it was the same thing.  They told me they would pull the item from the listing and get it straightened out one way or the other.  I will be looking to see if it is still listed.  I love the idea of trying new flavors but not at the expense of not getting all coffee.

The  selections should have been titled "Vanilla Assortment," since the majority of cups in the box were variations of that flavor.  There was nothing from Celestial Seasonings, but I enjoyed the coffees I did receive.  One other note - there was no packing slip with the order, so if I was not satisfied, I'm not sure how I would have filed a complaint.

They sent 7 Hazelnut DECAF (7 DECAF!!!! And of the same!!) and like 8 hot cocoa, so more than half the order was not coffe that I could use for my morning caffein rush.  I had never received more than 2 decaf and 2 of other (hot cocoa or tea). Do not buy, look for other seller, even if it's a little more expensive it will be a lot better purchase than this.

Several of the flavors were very common flavors and not that exciting. A majority of the box I received was Donut shop chocolate glazed (5), Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla Cream (6), and of course Kahlua (8)... that is 19/34, so almost 2/3 of the package was 3 flavors.<br /><br />This sampler was not what I was hoping for and seemed to be a compilation of the flavors you see on the discount shelves at the store all the time. I could have bought a box of 18 Kahlua at big lots for $7. I would think that any sampler should limit themselves to know more that 4 of any given flavors.

review/text: I like to try a lot of different coffees with my Keurig and frequently buy random assortments like this one.  The k-cups came in a small box, just thrown in there, but they were packed fine in my opinion.  They box was the right size for the 34-count option I ordered and I even got 1 extra k-cup.  The assortment was ok.  I got commonly liked flavors, several were duplicates, and more than half the box was Green Mountain coffee.  I also got 6 decafs which I really don't drink, but I hold on to them for guests.  I generally prefer to get more of a variety of flavors and brands, but the flavors I received are ones I like, so I'm not really complaining.  Here's the breakdown of what I got.<br /><br />Green Mountain Coffee:<br />3 Caramel Vanilla Cream<br />2 Hazelnut Noisette<br />6 French Vanilla<br />2 Mocha Nut Fudge<br />2 Southern Pecan<br />1 Wild Mountain Blueberry Fair Trade<br />2 Hazelnut (Decaf)<br />4 French Vanilla (Decaf)<br /><br />Gloria Jean's:<br />1 Hazelnut<br />1 Butter Toffee<br />2 French Vanilla Supreme<br />5 Mudslide<br /><br />Donut House:<br />1 Chocolate Glazed Donut<br />1 Cinnamon Roll<br /><br />2 Kahlua

review/text: The Flavored Coffee Samples were packaged in a paper bag which busted open and several of the coffee's had spilled all over my other products.  These products were the Monster High 1600 Draculaura Doll, and the Monster High Skull Shores Ghoulia Yelps Doll. These were birthday present's that I had to give with coffee and the coffee smell all over it.  Very dissatisfied with the packaging and also didn't get to experience some of the flavors of the coffee..I would have returned the package but like I said the doll was a present and no time to replace the gift. The coffee smell was very obvious, and I was embarrassed with this as a gift.  I wish I would have thought to take a picture!!! Very dissatisfied!!!!! I think the coffee should be replaced and will be reporting this to Amazon!!! READ other similar comments!!!!  DON"T buy from this Seller....

review/summary: Assorted k cups
review/text: Boy am I disappointed! I was looking forward to trying some new flavors and I got pretty much all the flavors I have already tried! I really do NOT want 5 chocolate donut, 4 butter toffee, 4 kahlua and 3 French vanilla. The description mentions many different types of coffee k cups. Seems to me that you should be able to get one of each flavor. Terrible vendor. I should have listened to other reviews but was hoping that the company would take notice of the bad reviews and improve their service. Shame on you!
