review/text: These are the perfect size for small dogs or dogs who don't need the extra calories from rewards. The boys love all of the small Blue Dog Bakery Treats!  My only wish is that since one must order a case of six, it would nice if there were a Multi-variety case.  Thanks!

review/summary: Real success with training
review/text: My sister in law gave our dog a box of these treats for Christmas.  We have a new puppy and he loves them.  We taught him to "sit" in one day with these, we broke them in half, and he thinks they are great.  We had success so I passed a box on to two of my friends who just got puppies, they love them too...I told them to go to Amazon for the best deal.  They always have what I want at a great price and delivery is quick.

review/summary: Have you ever seen a look of disappointment in a dogs eyes?
review/text: I bought a case of six boxes based on positive reviews. My small dog can't really handle hard, chewy treats. She loves peanut butter and these sounded great. I can't begin to describe the look on her face when I promise her a treat and then get out this box. She takes one look at the box and her ears go down and she just turns her back and walks away before I can even get it out. They are just too dry and crumbly, I guess. When I open up a pack of the new Cesar filet mignon treats, on the other hand, she starts to jump in the air as high as my waist! She knows the packaging! Now I have five boxes of this to donate to the Humane Society. I believe that other dogs like them, just not mine.

review/summary: very "selective" pet
review/text: I own two Cavaliers, and while my tri-color will eat almost anything she finds and any treat available, my blenheim girlie loves blue dog bakery treats! She has always preferred these treats as well as my homemade peanut butter ones and will turn her little nose up whenever she is offered any other kind on the market! Sofie and I prefer the smaller ones since she is a little lady with a little mouth. Her sister, Zoe, loves them too (of course!) and I feel as though they are eating a higher quality, lower fat treat that helps to keep their good diets on track. And the very best way to buy these treats is from Amazon: with good prices, free shipping (with 2 six-packs) and very fast delivery.

review/summary: GREAT, all-natural, health dog treats!!
review/text: First of all, *I* LOVE that I live in Seattle, WA where Blue Dog Bakery's headquarters are located  :-) Nothing like "buying local"! Second, I REALLY like this company's products as their treats have limited ingredients - things that are healthy and not excessive sugars and fillers, which is great!<br /><br />CON: I test EVERY treat first before giving it to my dog and all three flavors were each pretty decent tasting (and they're all LOW FAT - great for me). However, I certainly couldn't taste the difference between the 3 flavors and I'm darn sure my dog can't either. The ingredients are also things I would likely find in my own pantry so if I *really* wanted to, I could make these treats myself and add my own flavoring to make them more realistic tasting based on their individual flavors.<br /><br />My dog LOVES these treats though and they are perfect size for training (in fact, I split each piece in half) and sometimes I'll crush 1-2 up in her food when I'm getting her used to a new kibble. Works every time!<br /><br />I recently found these at my local Grocery Outlet for $1.79/box (YAHOO!!!) so I bought 20 boxes since that's an even better price than here at Amazon for the 6-pk AND I don't have to pay for shipping  :-) Very wholesome goodness at a VERY good price!

review/summary: Good brand of cookies.
review/text: My senior German Shephard likes the Blue Dog Bakery peanut butter and molasses cookies a lot more than these. It's weird she would only take it if she saw me take a bite. Even then she took it and dropped it on her bed and never ate it. Never had to do that with the peanut butter cookies. They are small cookies. Good for small and big dogs.  Nice deal, won't stop me from buying her other flavors from this company but both my dog and I are very disappointed with these.

review/text: I have been ordering these small dog treats for quite some time.  I love the small size for my NOT SO SMALL DOGS!<br />They get a treat (or two) when they get in their crates when we leave or they go to bed for the night.  One would think the treat was raw steak...especially watching Tink'r Bell (a 55 lb bulldog) RUN to her crate to get her Super Star! (and don't get in her way; she'll knock anyone, anything over!)  I never liked large treats that a dog can chew on, leave a mess, or take too long to finish or gulp down too fast!  These Super Stars are just the right size!!  AND...they're healthy!

review/text: We have strong willed poodles who take a long unleashed walk in a public park everyday.  Holler treat and they come running, then sit cheerfully waiting for their reward for coming.  They love these dog snacks.  The treat is small enough that we can give them a couple while on a long walk.  Our dogs like the variety of the assortment.  With subscribe and save the price is good.  And our dogs are motivated to behave in public without having snacks that result in them eating too much or having an upset stomach.

review/summary: Cheap enough on sale but.MY DOG WILL NOT EAT THEM
review/text: My dog is not that interested in them. She ignores them sometimes, and at other times eats them. All in all she does not seem too interested in them. She is not a finicky dog. When fed her morning and afternoon meal she wolfs them down, same with all her other treats. I was hoping she would do the same with these but she mouths it and then drops it. She usually has Innova , but I have not seen her turn away any dog food offered. Because she is not choosy I was very surprised with the high ratings to find her leaving these on the ground and walking away. If I keep giving it to her she will eventually eat them. All these glowing reviews bring to mind a cliche, sometimes some thing to good to be true is just that!

review/summary: WARNING - Cans buckling!
review/text: I purchased and received a case of these 6 oz items mid-March-2008. I used two cans then and in reflection remember one of them spewing some paste when first pierced by the opener. Tonight I've gone to open another can and this time it really projected out the paste when pierced with the opener. So I decide to check over the others and find 4 of them really BULGING - each end pouched outwards a centimeter or so. And another 8 cans showing 1 to 3 mm bulges at each end!  This case has been in an A/C-ed home in a dark closet.<br /><br />The case of small cans appears to come from 3 different lot numbers (OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1121, OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1122 AND OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1123) Note the 1121/1122/1123 code differs.<br /><br />With just my visual inspection it appears all affected cans are 1122 but I will not be eating any of the remainders. I will be contacting the manufacturer ASAP to see if there has been a recall or known problem.

review/summary: Bpa, endocrine disruptor?
review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Everyday Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

review/summary: BPA? Yes and no...
review/text: I contacted Muir Glen directly and asked whether or not their cans contained BPA. You can see their response below:<br /><br />"Thank you for contacting Muir Glen about bisphenol-A or BPA.<br /><br />Bisphenol-A is a component of protective coatings in metal food packaging, and provides an important food safety and quality function in canned foods. Scientific and governmental bodies worldwide have examined the science many times and have concluded that the weight of evidence supports the safety of BPA, including recent comprehensive assessments in Japan and in the European Union.<br /><br />In January 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced another review of BPA. This review in expected to take 18-24 months, and Health Canada and the World Health Organization (WHO) will participate.<br /><br />Most metal cans in the food industry utilize BPA in the can lining or can lid. Some of our products do, and many competitors' products do as well.<br /><br />Muir Glen continues to believe BPA is safe. However, we know that some of our consumers have wanted us to pursue alternatives. We have been working with our can suppliers and can manufacturers to develop and test alternative linings that do not use BPA for some time.<br /><br />One alternative has proven safe and viable in our processing of tomatoes - and Muir Glen is in the midst of transitioning to cans with liners that do not use BPA. It is an approved non-epoxy alternative. Can coatings used by Muir Glen also comply fully with all applicable U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements for safe use in food contact applications.<br /><br />Your views are important to us. Again, thank you for contacting Muir Glen, and thank you for your support of our products.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Consumer Services"

review/summary: muir glen organic tomato paste
review/text: I have always been impressed by the high quality of Muir Glen organic tomato products. The flavor and thickness of the paste surpasses even the best of the leading national brands. That is probably because they use tomatoes which have been ripened on the vine, increasing their nutritional and flavor potential. They are also grown without chemical fertilizer, which causes fruits and vegetables to enlarge and ripen at an unnatural rate, absorbing more water and less nutrients in the process.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: As wonderful as most milka products are, I think this one beats them all. After traveling in Europe for the past five years, I have grabbed numerous of their chocolates on the way to the airport as gifts for friends and loved ones.  I've tried almost every combination they make, and the minis are the best thing I have tasted.  The marshmallow in the middle truly completes this snack and they come in mini packets so it makes it easier to not eat the entire box in one sitting.  Though, as good as they are it's still tough.  Makes an excellent stocking stuffer, and due to them being individually pieced, it makes being health conscious easier for fellow chocolate lovers.  Goes well with a morning coffee or a glass of cold milk.  I have no association with this product.  I just love it.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like gluten free
review/text: After switching to a gluten free diet I was discouraged by the taste of all the breads and crackers I tried. This was the first one I tasted that I was like, Wow, that doesn't taste gluten-free at all! The word "lentil" threw me, but it's really the best cracker out there, gluten free or no. The pepper and salt varieties are good, too, but this one is the best. Add a little whipped cream cheese and it's the perfect snack.

review/summary: Best GF cracker around
review/text: These are the best gluten-free cracker I've ever had.  Since GF crackers are usually disgusting, that might not be saying much, but these can stand up against non-GF crackers.  Their crispness is similar to wheat-thins without the sweetness.  My only critique is that I wish they had a non-salted variety as I think they would be just fine with less or no salt.  But the salt is easy to pick off as it is.  The rosemary flavor could use a little more rosemary, but they are nice, neutral crackers to pair with a dip or cheese.  Even with these criticisms, I still gave 5 stars.  I'm so excited I found them.

review/summary: No. Flavor.
review/text: I did a wheat-free trial diet for 30 days, and one of the snacks I had on hand were these lentil crackers from the Mediterranean Baked brand.  Plain Sea Salt Lentil Crackers.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Crispy crackers don't leave you feeling heavy after snacking.<br />- Different dips or toppings can be paired with it.<br />- Great list of ingredients<br />- Gluten-free<br />- 5g protein in a serving.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Rather bland and tasteless.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I found the crackers to be pretty bland.  They're not overly salty, which is nice, but I guess lentils just don't carry enough flavor on their own.  These crackers are good if you have a dip or topping for them, as their bland flavor makes a great base for just about any dip flavor.<br /><br />These are an okay snack for those on a gluten-free diet.  If you don't need to live gluten-free, find another cracker, for your tastebuds' sake.

review/summary: Tasty little crackers
review/text: I just started eating gluten free and gave these a try.  I haven't tried many GF crackers, but the ones I have tried all tended to taste like crunchy rice crisps, blah!  These were not the case and taste like real crackers!  They are made from Lentil flour which gives these crackers a nice boost of protein. Unlike many other GF products, these aren't loaded with starches, so they are healthier for you.  The rosemary flavoring is great.  The expiration date on thees were 9-10 months out, so they arrived fresh with plenty of time to enjoy.

review/summary: These are, um, interesting.
review/text: I ordered a bunch of these in order to help crave my salty/crunchy cravings given the fact that I'm trying to limit my carb intake.  It's particularly the high-carb empty calories I need to cut out like grains and potatoes.  Well, there goes about 99% of all of the yummy snack foods on the market.<br /><br />Now I gave these a try not expecting much, and I have found that they are extremely interesting.  They are definitely not for everyone, but I found that they did satiate my salty/crunchy cravings.  The texture takes some getting used to, though.  And it helps that I really like cheese.<br /><br />I'm throwing a 3 out of five stars up there.  They are good enough so that I will try other flavors, but they aren't exactly the most delicious snak food ever, either.  I mean, I'd much rather have a plate of nachos or a bag of potato chips, but this will suffice for now.<br /><br />EDIT:  After eating these for a few days, I'm upping my rating to four stars.  The more I eat them, the more I like them.  In fact, I'll even go so far as to say that I even crave them.  I can't wait to try some of the other flavors.  Honey dijon and bacon are the two I'm most looking forward to.

review/text: I'd had these many years ago, and hadn't seen them. I was SO glad to find them again.  They are just baked cheese- nothing else. The flavor is intensely cheesy, and a bit on the salty side- but something I'll buy again.  Outstanding for those with carbohydrate restrictions (hey, diabetics- I'm one of you, and finding these to be just right for that salty snack urge). I also like the portion control.  :)  BUY THEM !!!

review/summary: Different & Tasty
review/text: I first saw this snack item on the tv show "unwrapped" and became determined to find them and try them. When I first saw the package I was surprised at how small the packaging was, then when I opened it and popped one into my mouth I understood why. While tasty and non-greasy to the touch, I could not finish the package off the way I would a bag of chips or popcorn. After A few bites, I began to feel a little heaviness in my stomach. I put the bag down and went back to it later. on my second attempt I began to feel the same thing. Maybe it was the grease/fat (although it does not appear greasy) from the baked cheese, I'm not sure. Everytime I went to bag after a few bites I got this same feeling in my stomach. I let other people try them and they liked the taste and crunchy texture but I noticed no one finished one of the 0.5 oz bags. Maybe it is my stomach that is sensitive to them that greasy/full feeling was enough to keep me fron ordering them again, but they tasted really good. Maybe I have a sensitive stomach. Enjoy them!

review/summary: One of the few low carb snacks I buy
review/text: Being on a low carb diet is not too difficult, but I crave something crunchy every now and then that isn't bacon or nuts.  These cheese snacks are very portable and are satisfying for a quick bite.  I have tried several baked cheese snacks and prefer this one over all the rest.  My only complaint is that a package can contain quite a few over-baked rounds. With there only being a handful in each small package anyway, there is not much left over to eat.  I dislike the burnt flavor of the ones that are overcooked, so I throw them away.  Some packages contain all perfectly cooked rounds and it's a yummy treat.  When I get a bag with lots of over-baked ones I feel I'm not getting my money's worth.

review/summary: Merely okay
review/text: Some people really get into the Just the Cheese snacks, but I think they're just okay.  They *are* crispy and salty, but there's something odd about the texture.  Like a flattened dried chunk of styrofoam.  And they don't taste particularly good, either.  There's no real jalapeno flavor, nor do they taste like cheese.  Sort of a nondescript crunchy thing.  But if you're low-carbing it and jonesing for a crunchy snack to munch on, they're better than diving into a bag of Fritos.  I like the popped cheese better - probably because those are much saltier and crunchier, so they satisfy me with just a couple of bites.  However Just the Cheese, like the popped cheese, can be turned into croutons or floated in soup to give it some texture.<br /><br />It's kind of the snack equivalent of Totino's pizza - crap food that sometimes just hits the spot.

If you always scrape the little baked on bits of cheese off aluminum foil and baking sheets, give it a try!

Can't wait to taste the "fried cheese."

review/summary: crunchy and delicious
review/text: Very very good! It's like when you make a pizza and the cheese melts off and hits the pan and gets all crispy, only much more convienient since it's in a single serving bag. Just to warn you, this is dry, seasoned, crunchy cheese. If you are expecting something chewy, you will be sorely mistaken. Great for gluten-intolerant people(like me) too!

review/summary: kind of salty and dry, but a good crunch if you are carbo craving
review/text: These are very salty, and the nacho flavor on "just cheese" seems kind of redundant. The quantity in the bag is very scant. I understand that it is probably expensive to reduce cheese to these little crunchy treats.

review/text: I see that some people just hate these.  My son, who is the pickiest kid on the planet LOVES these things.  He's six and has loved them since he was able to eat them.  I think they are so so.  But I don't buy them for me.  He took them for the snack at his preschool and some kids spit them out, others didn't mind.  I wouldn't invest in an entire box of them if you haven't tried them yet.  Go to [...] and get a bag first.  They are pretty good for you too.  My son loves salty crunchy stuff and since this is all cheese, then not so bad for him.

review/text: These are pretty good, but you've gotta realize that each pack is the size of a pack of peanuts.  A lot of the space in each bag is air.  I suppose it is to keep the puffs from breaking.<br /><br />Flavorwise, they're alright.  Cheesy, crunchy, and a bit too salty to eat a lot of.  They're not amazing though.  You could probably get more concentrated flavor by baking your own cheese, but the problem is of course time.  This is very light flavored.

review/summary: Cheese droppings
review/text: Yuck. I'd use a more colorful title for this review than "cheese droppings" that means the same thing but rhymes with "cheese curds" but am not sure that'd make it past Amazon's content policies.<br /><br />You know how if you're baking a pizza or something and some of the cheese falls off and lands directly on the pan, then overcooks into a hard, crunchy, oily salt lick? Yeah, that's what these are. They're strongly flavored to hide the underlying horror. It doesn't help.<br /><br />I should admit that I'm not this product's target audience. I was just looking for a tasty snack, not realizing that these are intended for people on ultra-low-carb diets. But if you want to get 100% of your snack calories from fat, might I suggest pork rinds? They've got a pleasant bacon-y taste and are not foul abominations like these are. Or if pork rinds aren't to your taste, perhaps you could try drinking used motor oil. I'm pretty sure that doesn't have any carbs either, and can't taste much worse.<br /><br />I see that a few reviewers have said things that weren't entirely negative. Well, everybody's entitled to an opinion, and theirs is wrong. I'm stuck with a bunch of this garbage and I don't know what to do with it. I'd send them to my worst enemy, but I don't hate him all _that_ much.

review/summary: Low in Carbs, High in Sodium!
review/text: Be careful!  The low carbs get you, but if you have a problem with sodium, realize the content is high!  I have been buying these "crunchy cheese snacks" in Classic White Cheddar for a couple of years.  I was originally drawn by the low carbs per serving bag.  The 1/2 oz bag says "1 g".  I bought them by the box of 16 packs.  I used "subscribe and save" and started buying 4 boxes of 16 - 1/2 oz bags, per month. That's 64 of these 1/2 oz bags each month.  They are also available in 2 oz bags. Plus, they grow on you.  Literally.  I knew, but didn't take into consideration the high sodium - 275mg per 1/2oz bag - until recently.  A rep at the company told me they were working to cut the sodium content.  I hope it happens, soon.  I won't buy any more until they do. I like that they are also Gluten-Free.  It's just too much sodium for a little bag and people should be aware of it.

There were only a few whole pieces in the bag and a couple of crumbs. Someone was not packing based on weight that day. I will eat real cheese any day. It is more filling to eat a chunk of real cheese. Plus real white cheddar can be left non-refrigerated for up to two weeks and still be safe to eat! Just call Mars Cheese Castle and ask them all about it.

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: There are few foods I don't like, but I couldn't get these down. I can't begin to describe how terrible they taste and how unappetizing the texture is. Unfortunately, I bought them in several flavors and each one I opened was worse than the one before. I begged my co-workers to take them off my hands but no one would eat them. I even offered five bucks to whoever would eat a bag of them and no one could do it -- and I work in an office of cheapskakes who never met free food they didn't like. Don't buy these.<br /><br />If you want a no-carb crispy cheese snack put a thin layer of shredded cheese on a plate and microwave it for roughly 2 minutes. Keep checking so you don't burn it but let bubble up and get crispy. Much much much much much better than these nasty freaky cheese thingies.

review/text: These little cheese crisps taste like toasted cheese.  My favourite part of making anything with melted cheese is the little bits that get brown and crunchy - and that's what these taste like.  They are low in carbs and anyone who is on a low carb diet knows that once in a while you crave a crunchy snack.  They are salty, but I don't eat anything else that is high in sodium so I figure a 2 oz bag isn't going to hurt me.

review/summary: Yummy, weird, salty, and high in fat... but I like them!
review/text: I would give these 3 and 1/2 stars if I could. Now that I have tried these I see why there are so many "mixed" reviews. To start: they are NOT "healthy". Yes, they are low in carbs, but for the total calories from fat (60 out of 75) - the percentage is WAY too high. That means the calories are 80% from fat. Yes, I realize they are made of cheese, which is mostly fat, but they are not something I want to be eating all day every day. (Kind of like the 100-calorie pack treats that are portion controlled, but not so "healthy" either.) Plus, they are high in sodium like most other people have pointed out. However, they are very low in carbs (1 gram) and high in protein (5 grams). I got the "Classic White Cheddar Cheese". Keep in mind that white cheddar is one of my all-time favorite cheeses. The texture is crunchy - similar to a rice cake (a little denser). The one thing that I strongly DON'T like, is the weird, greasy, oily feeling it leaves on my teeth. But maybe that is just me. But the flavor is fine. The packaging states the following:<br /><br />1 bag (0.5 oz.) - 14 grams:<br /><br />Calories: 75<br />Calories from fat: 60<br />Total fat - 6.5g (10% Daily Value [DV])<br />Cholesterol - 25mg (8% DV)<br />Sodium - 275mg (12% DV)<br />Total carbs - 1g (0% DV)<br />Protein - 5 g<br />Vitamin A - 5% DV<br />Calcium - 16% DV<br /><br />The size of the bag reminds me of those little pouches of fruit gummies that they make for kids lunches.<br /><br />So, all in all, a decent tasting, low carb, high fat snack. Not something I will eat every day, but a nice "treat" when I am in the mood for something salty and crunchy.
