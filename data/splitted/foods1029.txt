review/summary: Pleases fussy Collie stomach
review/text: I feed this to my Collie Lady.  She has a very fussy stomach, and you give her almost anything else and she gets the runs.  We had been feeding her Evolve from when we got her from the breeder.  The breeder gave us a small bag with her, but then she started to poop in the house and is was runny and not well formed, we found out that they had changed the formulation of the food and we had been giving her this for almost 5 years.  We did a lot of research and then tried the California Natural Chicken and Rice adult dog food and she was fine and she loved it.  We only give her 6 oz. twice a day and her weight is great and she is very healthy, has great Vet checkups.  I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially those whose dogs have fussy stomachs, the ingredients are all natural and of very high quality, suitable for human consumption.

review/summary: Great experience
review/text: My dog is allergic to wheat gluten.  Every other food she has tried (including other high-quality brands) resulted in itching, vomiting and/or diarrhea.  I got this food because of the limited ingredients.  She has done very well on it.  She doesn't scratch all the time, she doesn't vomit, etc.  I only took one star off because I would like this food better if it contained probiotics.  I supplement her food with a small amount of fish oil, a small amount of probiotics and a dog supplement called "gas defense" that helps with digestion.  Still, I am sure that even without all these supplements she would do well on this food.  If your dog has food allergies I recommend trying it.  For reference: she is a 60-pound lab and she eats 1-cup of this twice a day.  Also, she could probably stand to lose 2-3 pounds.

review/summary: Do Not recommend for sensitive stomach
review/text: I have a 1 year old Golden retriever who has a sensitive stomach. After trying Iams and Eukanuba Puppy we made the switch to the more quality California Natural Chicken and Rice Puppy formula which was great for him (firm stools and shiny coat). Now that he was ready to switch to adult formula (weighing in at 75 pounds now) I thought it sensible to choose the Adult Chicken and Rice formula by Calif. Nat. However, he has had an awful reaction even after gradually introducing the adult food with puppy food. He is itching a lot, ear infections, and chewing his paws, HORRIBLE gas, and loose stools. I do not recommend for sensitive stomach Golden Retrievers. We are going to try grain free options...

review/text: So far this is the only food that I've found that my Border collie and adopted Australian Shepherd do well on. They used to itch and shed a lot until I switched to this food. It has limited ingredients, less chance of food alergies. I have tried many high cost and probably high quality foods but nothing worked. I have just recently tried Avoderm chicken meal and it seems to be working also, so I might have finally found another food that they can tolerate. I hope so as I would like them to have a little variety.

review/summary: Very Nice Medium Roast Flavor
review/text: To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words "Medium Extra Bold" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Amazon should correct that description  and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other.

review/summary: My Favorite by a Landslide so Far
review/text: I must admit that I have gone a little overboard with my k-cup sampling.  So far I must have tried about 50 different blends.  OVerall I must say that the vast majority of them have been pleasant, better than what I used to make in my coffee brewer.  Then I tried the Donut Shop brand.  When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about.  When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing.  Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe.  My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day.  Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one.  It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite.  I will still search for something better, but I doubt I will find it.  I hope you like -- no strike that -- I hope you love this coffee as much as I do.

review/summary: Great Coffee--competetive price!
review/text: I've had my Keurig brewer for 5 months and have tried a lot of brands and the Coffee People Donut Shop regular is among my favorites. Green Mountain Nantucket Blend and Timothy's Italian Blend are also favorites.<br /><br />One reviewer remarked about Subscribe & Save costing less. It's only a dollar and a few pennies cheaper than this packaging and Subscribe and Save does not offer Donut Shop "regular" but instead has "Extra Bold". Also, this packaging gives you 50 k-cups as opposed to 48 (2) 24 count packages in Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about not having the standard boxes to dispense the coffee. I purchased a K-Cup carousel, available on Amazon for $19.95 that holds 26 k-cups; it looks nicer by my Keurig than cardboard boxes.

review/summary: Wake Up To Caffienated Perfection!
review/text: We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year, so we've been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible. This coffee is -- BAR NONE -- the best of the bunch. It is rich, syrupy and just a bit sweet. My experience, thus far, has been that the K-Cups listed as "extra bold" produce the best cups of coffee, but many of those are only available in dark roasts, while I prefer a medium roast. If you're a fan of a good, old fashioned diner-style cup of coffee (like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that), then this is the brew for you. We love it and make sure we always have some on hand.

review/summary: Great taste - poor packaging wastes k-cups
review/text: I love the taste of this coffee.  But apparently they have poor quality control.  These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly.  You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to.  Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem.<br /><br />It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens.<br /><br />I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them.<br /><br />Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing.

review/text: My husband and I are crazy about Coffee People k-cups.  A friend gave us a box of the "Donut Shop" cups and they are spectacular.  Very rich and bold, not bitter, but packs a nice punch.  Reminds me of coffee from an old-fashioned percolator.  A good, strong cup of coffee is hard to come by when you are using some of these newer brewing machines, but the Keurig system is definitely the exception and this variety of k-cup is the best we have ever tasted.

review/summary: A perfect "Anytime" coffee that is sure to please.
review/text: I have tried many, many brands and blends in my Keurig coffee maker and this is definetely one of my favorites.  The type of coffe I drink depends on my mood.  Sometimes I want a strong, bold cup like, Newman's Own Extra-bold Special Blend K-cups, 80 Pk for Keurig Brewers and sometimes I want something more mild like, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NP30XQ">Green Mountain K-Cup Single-Serving Coffee 108-ct.- Nantucket Blend</a>  But ever since I have had my Keurig I have been looking for one of my favorite coffees.  The Dunkin Donut brand.<br /><br />This coffee is superb and very much like the Dunkin Donut brand.  Not bold or bitter.  Not weak or under flavored.  It is smooth and very flavorful.  It is the perfect crowd pleasing blend for any time of day or night.<br /><br />I have shopped all over and you can't beat the variety or the price here on Amazon when you join their club.  A great value.<br /><br />I do wish that Amazon would change the name by removing "Extra Bold".  It is not.  It is, at most, a medium roast.  Even when brewed with the smallest setting of the Keurig I would not concider it bold.  It comes out great on the medium size setting.  Very remanicent of that great cup of Joe you would get in the old days at your favorite diner.

review/text: Just left packaging feedback, but upon review, the issue appears to be quality control.  I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each.  In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in.  Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.  I hope the folk at Coffee People can rectify this situation, as this is my favorite coffee, but I will not order this product again without some resolve on their side.

review/text: If you start reading cat food labels you will discover few that have the quality of ingredients that this one does.  Well, actually you will discover some - probably in a nice pet food store - but good luck getting your cat to eat it!<br /><br />One of my cats used to be pre-diabetic, asthmatic, and overweight.  At that time his diet was exclusively Iams.  My vet, who has done much research on various foods, has a list of cat food she recommends.  Of all the expensive and exclusive brands of food, the Fancy Feast Turkey & Giblets Feast and the Gourmet Chicken Feast really made a difference, and my other more finicky eaters loved it!  The 'problem cat' is no longer asthmatic, has lost weight, and is not pre-diabetic.  Plus, everyone who sees him can't get over what a fantastic shiny coat he has.  Now I buy these two flavors exclusively.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Great Affordable Canned Cat Food
review/text: If you have to buy cat food from the grocery store, know that your choices are limited in getting anything that's actually good for your cat. Purina has all but left the cat food buyer in peril with cheap ingredients, some which are downright awful. Having said this, Fancy Feast's Chicken Classic is probably the most available and better made canned foods out there, not to mention it's economical. Luckily, the gross "by-products" are minimal and there are no grains or wheat gluten in this formula.<br /><br />Fancy Feast is on sale all the time at either Target or my grocery store. In my experience, cans of Fancy Feast Chicken Classic from Walmart are more watery than cans I buy at other retailers. When I began buying this food, the differences in the look of the pate and the content from store A and content from WM were unmistakable. It's not that the food was bad, but it was definately more watery. I've been told Purina makes special batches with less meat content for major discounters. Perhaps WM is one of them.<br /><br />The top six ingredients in this the Chicken Classic formula are; chicken, chicken broth, liver, meat by-products, fish, and poultry by-products. This ingredient list beats any other Fancy Feast formula on the shelves so I recommend it. I take one star off my rating because of the two types of gross by-products in the formula.

review/summary: Fancy Feast.....kitty "crack"
review/text: Cats love this stuff.  My Fancy Feast cat is now 14 yrs old.  He is beginning to have kidney issues and the vet wanted him exclusively on a prescription diet.  He wasn't having any of the prescription diet (loving his Fancy Feast) so I ended-up mixing it half-n-half.  Perhaps this wasn't an ideal solution, but the good news is he would at least get some prescription food.  It has worked because last blood work showed a better kidney function and vet was pleased.  My cat has always loved his Fancy Feast preferring the "Classic" variety over the grilled or shredded stuff.

review/summary: My cat no longer needs insulin because of this food
review/text: I have diabetic cat. My cat started exhibiting symptoms and I went to my vet who started him on insulin. He progessively got worse, as the insulin doses steadily increased. My super smart, very litter trained cat got completely out of his mind one night and climbed on top of a shoe box and peed. Poor thing didn't know where he was or what was going on.<br /><br />At that, I went to the internet and found yourdiabeticcat.com. I started reading and was so skeptical but out of pure desperation I started doing what the people on the boards there suggested. I started tracking my cat's blood sugar daily at home myself. I took him off of dry food and started feeding him fancy feast classics. His blood sugars eventually started leveling out.<br /><br />I went back to my vet and informed her of my changes with my cat and she was amazed. I asked her to research some concerns I had with the fancy feast. She researched it for me and told me the fancy feast is fine. My cat no longer gets insulin shots. I honestly couldn't believe it myself. He is back to his normal self: smart, energetic, and using his litter.<br /><br />I now buy this food automatically off of amazon in three different flavors for variety. I have two cats and they both love all three classic flavors that I buy. (Turkey, Chicken and Beef) I highly recommend this food for the health of your cat.<br /><br />Also, I have two large male cats and they eat an average of 3 cans a day each. Hopefully that will help you figure out how much you need for your cat. If for some reason, they get full and don't finish a full can in one sitting I have to cover up the left overs. They will not eat them if they have dried out, but they will eat them if I have covered them and allowed them to retain their moisture.

review/summary: My beautiful Sheba thrives on this and loves it!
review/text: Fancy Feast is good cat food but it's tricky for me to get the flavor my cat will<br />always eat since she is a gorgeous picky female.  This brand also comes in many different textures and the flaky version, as well as any type with gravy, neither of my cats will touch.<br />This particular Chicken Feast flavor is what they call the "classic" which is the usual<br />texture of cat food and the one both my cats like.  I found it difficult to say the least to pick out the correct texture when in the supermarket as there are so many different flavors and textures available and the cans are jumbled together so I had to fish through them trying to find ones marked "classic", so I prefer getting this by the case here on Amazon.<br /><br />Sheba does have slight allergies to certain cat foods, as do many cats.  They itch and can develop bumps under their chins or in the case of one poor cat I had, terrible bumps and systemic itching all over, with fur loss, if the exact right food isn't given to them. That cat had to get only Hill's hypoallergy formula food from the vet or he would be tortured by itching, bumps and fur loss.<br /><br />Also using only stainless steel bowls for food and water helps tremendously if your cat gets chin bumps. Even plastic dishes get bacteria that can cause itchy bumps under a cat's chin.<br />My cats love this chicken flavor and texture and it doesn't cause any allergy problems in Sheba so far.  She also has no itchy problem with Nutro dry cat food so I can recommend that one if your cat has a problem with itchy skin bumps.  In fact her fur is just incredibly gorgeous and she is a big fit muscular healthy cat, so I can recommend this highly.

review/summary: Best for my cat
review/text: Lately this all chicken pack costs more on Amazon than the chicken/turkey/beef variety pack.  My cat does best with chicken and sometimes turns her little pink nose up at the beef and turkey.  Is the chicken of higher quality than the beef and turkey and that's why the variety pack costs less?  I withhold one star because FF has by-products in it.  However this classic recipe does not have grains and it is the only cat food my girl will willingly eat day after day.

review/summary: THE BEST CANNED FOOD ON THE MARKET.
review/text: I've been a cat lover for 25+yrs and in that time have tried many different cat foods for the 5 cats that were part of the family.I have done my research on almost all of the canned cat foods on the market and could not find one canned food that had the superior ingredients that's in the Fancy Feast canned foods. check it out yourself and read the first ingredients on 99% of all canned foods and they almost never start out with the flavor on the label.I've seen canned beef flavor and their main ingredient is chicken parts and a form of rice with beef broth. You can't go wrong with any of the Fancy Feast foods made by Purina. Thanks RB

Not sure how this compares to other products and value.  Although looking around when I purchased this it seemed to have been a good deal and comes in a 4 pack.  However, this tastes great mixed to various foods.  I think we may have used this in the cooking class (a while ago) when we were making a humus.  I've used it in Red Quino and it a nice change of pace.

review/summary: Amazing Quick Healthy Breakfast, and Vegan!
review/text: Original Mix (I prefer this one because there is no added sugars)<br /><br />Taste:<br />In a green smoothie: Changes the texture of the smoothie just a bit, nothing too noticeable or annoying.  Also adds a different flavor to the overall smoothie that helps enhance the taste when combined with the right greens and fruits.<br /><br />With Almond milk: I am not used to eating sugars and processed foods, so this actually tastes pretty great to me. I saw some earlier reviews complaining about taste and I honestly have no problem slowly sipping on this shake as I drive to work in the morning. I have tasted some horrid protein shakes in the past and this one is delicious!<br /><br />Overall Feeling:<br /><br />I feel fantastic after having Amazing Meal in the morning. Completely clear minded and energized for the day. Even without the accompaniment of a multivitamin, this meal powder stands alone in providing a days worth of energy and clear minded thinking.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I found that I needed to get used to the added probiotic that is apart of the meal. I found myself for the first four or five days, starving only 2 hours after drinking one of these shakes. It was like I couldn't get enough food, I had to eat every two to three hours to stop the hunger. I am unsure whether it has to do with the combo of probiotic or the digestive enzyme that is added. Like I said though, after 5 days that feeling of starving all the time went away. It now fulfills me completely.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />This is the best meal shake I have come across thus far in my search for the perfect morning/ after workout shake. I have tried many from whole foods and other various health food stores. The fact that I have decided to actually buy another container of Amazing Meal must mean I really like it! I've been taking it for 2 weeks and, this wasn't my initial intention, but have lost 5 pounds. A nice little added bonus :)<br /><br />Highly reccomened if you are looking for a great protein/vitamin/healthy living shake. Oh and did I mention it is Alkaline based? Perfect!<br /><br />x x

review/summary: My Favorite--I LOVE this stuff
review/text: I have multiple food allergies, which makes a grab-and-go breakfast...well...not possible. I wanted a meal replacement shake because I tend not to eat during the day (way too complicated) and not eating actually helps me gain weight. I also have some other health issues--like Hashimoto's--directly related to my allergies. Food is an issue for me, and so is energy and feeling well.<br /><br />I'm not vegan, but I prefer vegan foods for their cleanliness. I can't have soy, but many vegan products are soy-free anyway. I also like whole, organic, Non-GMO foods, and while I prefer Raw, I don't mind non-raw foods, either.<br /><br />I tried several vegan, gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free shake mixes: Garden of Life, Vega, Inca Meal, RAW, etc. This is, by far, the best tasting, best "feeling" shake I've tried.<br /><br />I've tried all the flavors--Chocolate is my fave, then Pomegranate (sp?) Mango and Vanilla Chai, in that order. I mix mine is a shaker cup with a little mixing ball. I use Vanilla almond milk and a little agave syrup (I hate Stevia, it tastes like saccharine to me) and sometimes I throw a little extra hemp protein in, chia seeds, and flaxseed oil. I haven't bothered with a blender yet. One day, I'll put it into a blender with some fruit.<br /><br />Let's be real: this is a whole food shake with fruits, veggies, grasses, and hemp protein. This is not a mass-market, full-of-stuff-I-can't-pronounce homogenized drink. This is real food, synthesized down to a mixable level. Dunkin Donuts it's not. So?<br /><br />Truthfully, the pure, clean, feel-good energy I get from this, plus the cleansing, tonifying, and gut-health benefits are worth chugging down a slightly earthy drink every morning. Mixed with vanilla almond milk & a little agave, I actually savor the flavor--not too sweet (sweet in the morning makes me gag) chocolatey and, well, nutritious-y.<br /><br />Try a sample packet (you can get them at your local HFS, usually) and see which flavor suits you. I don't ever like this mixed in water--its just too thin. I DO use it on oatmeal, or stirred into yogurt. This is an awesome product. I just saved $12 over what I pay at WF, plus Amazon will deliver it to me every 15 days so I'll never run out...heaven!

review/summary: Amazing Meal ORIGINAL
review/text: The other flavors of Amazing Meal sound rather yummy but they contain "Natural Flavors"  this is the only version that does not.  I even went to their website to make sure.  The addition of natural flavors is the only reason why I chose their Original over the others.<br /><br />I find the flavor is somewhat bland & absolutley is grassy!  Lately I've been mixing it with organic coconut water.  The quality of the coconut water affects just how tasty my "meal" turns out.  Sometimes I will add a few drops of organic liquid Stevia.<br /><br />I'm not sure what it is about this product that keeps me coming back for more.  I use Amazon's Subscribe & Save for it!  I'm not nuts about it, yet here I am drinking another glass!<br /><br />It is a quick & convenient way to get something nourishing into my body.  I find it is very refreshing.  I have never used it in a smoothie but when I do, I think it will be out of this world!  I have also mixed this with organic almond milk, organic rice milk & organic coconut milk.  The rice milk tasted the best probably because it was the sweetest.  The coconut milk was so so.  For now, I plan on sticking with the coconut water because I think it is the healthiest option & it tastes good enough for me.<br /><br />Overall this is a great way to get your greens & more in one quick "meal" though snack would be more appropriate as I don't find it filling for long.  Usually I pour a small amount of my liquid of choice into a glass, add a scoop of this (scoop is included), use a fork to stir it really good.  Then I add the rest of my liquid of choice & do lots more stirring.  I leave the fork in the glass & stir as needed because the fiber bits tend to settle on the bottom rather quickly.  Thankfully the amount that settles is substantially less than other mixes I've had.  I had a Organic Hemp protein shake that I flat out thought was disgusting & nearly all of it would settle on the bottom of the glass so fast I couldn't help but waste it! I'm sticking to Amazing Meal from now on.  Lesson learned!<br /><br />If you want to do something healthy & want to avoid all sugars & artificial sweeteners this mix is the way to go!  All Organic & GMO free!  If you are one of those sugar junkies who gets those "fast food" smoothies thinking it's healthy when it's just a sugar bomb you will surely hate this stuff.  For the rest of you health nuts lets raise a glass in good health!

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised (original flavor amazing meal)
review/text: I ordered this after comparing other natural brands such as Vega as a morning and or after workout shake. Although I am still curious about VEGA, I am very pleased that I chose this product instead. I chose this product because it seemed more simple and had no artificial sweetener (including stevia in that category) --stevia hasn't been well tested and there are other drawbacks to artificial sweetener such as deceiving the body's metabolism. I also read that Vega has a lot of Inulin which is a form of fiber that I have read is Not effective and is more of a filler to make things appear high in fiber.<br />Amazing meal in original flavor--When I got it in the mail I was surprised by the small size of the plastic can, but liked the packaging; It is visually pleasing and hopefully easily recycled. It is nice to see the ingredients are grown in America. The powder itself looks green and finely ground. I smelled it and could not tell if it would be palatable. I tasted a little in water and was pleased by the mild earthy taste. I then shook some in a blender bottle with ice and unsweetened soy milk. I was very relieved to find this expensive powder was not only palatable but tasted GOOD (to me). I am one of those people who are Used to the taste of natural foods. I could see myself adding a little honey to enrich the flavor. There is some granular-ness (not exactly gritty)  to the consistency, it is not all uniform, but this did not bother me. I was expecting a "grassy" taste as cued by other reviewers but I would call it more of a wheat, nutty flavor.  I am very happy with this purchase and will purchase this again if it manages to easily incorporate into my lifestyle. I would like it to be cheaper but I am ok with the quality and price. I bought it on the SUPER SAVER discount for a reduced price for regular shipments. Doing this is easy to cancel if you decide you don't like it.

The blurb makes it sound like it's sugar (cane juice) with pomegranate and mango added.<br /><br />In fact the ingredients are:<br />(1- proteins) Organic rice protein, organic hemp protein: 15,000mg<br />(2- greens) Organic wheat grass, organic kale, organic barley grass, organic alfalfa: 3,100mg<br />(3-antioxidants) Organic acai, organic carrot, organic blueberry, organic goji, Organic rose hips, organic maca, organic banana: 2,800mg<br />(4-other healthy stuff) Organic flax seed powder: 500mg, plus a small amount of probiotics<br />(5-other not-necessarily-healthy stuff) Organic cane juice, organic guar gum, natural flavors<br /><br />This is a good product to try if you want to get some of the benefits of wheat grass, kale, barley grass, etc. but tend to gag on the grass powders.  You won't gag on this.<br /><br />If you want to work up to the wheat grass, just add a little bit of that to a big scoop of this pomegranate/mango infusion and then work your way up.<br /><br />I add this to my dogs' food as a supplement.  They all love this pomegranate/mango taste.  This one lingers on their breath and makes them smell really good for a couple of hours after eating.

review/summary: Great Product, Great Flavor
review/text: This is the best tasting superfoods product! I love the taste, that it has protein and has all the benefits of eating superfoods. I have tasted other brands but not one is as good as this. I'm not vegan, but I do eat gluten free, and I love that I can get a fair amount of protein (10 grams in 1 serving) from vegan/gluten free sources. I also did the 14 day challenge that Amazing Grass offers. It is less of a "challenge" and more of 14 days of nutritional knowledge. I found it to be interesting and helpful.

review/summary: Very satisfied
review/text: Ordered this item as I am trying to eat more healthy. Was very skeptical at first coz of all  the reviews on the taste but I thought that I would give it a shot. I ordered the Mango Pomegranate Infusion and was not disappointed. It is green alright and looked like swamp water, but it has a good flavor to it ( I mixed it with water to avoid extra calories ). The consistency is not too thick or grainy either. I prefer this more than the other green stuff I had in the past. I think that I will continue drinking it once a day from now on. Hopefully it will do what it claims or your health<br /><br />Update; so today 1/22/12 is my second day drinking this swamp water looking thing and I have to say that I like it even more. It has a flavor, but just a hint..a note of fruit flavor in it which is why I like. It is not heavily sweetened and not over powering. If you are expecting a strong fruit flavor to cover up the green, then look elsewhere. For me, I really like it.<br /><br />One month later,2/20/12, I can feel that I am in a very healthy stage of my life. Not to mention that it makes me not want to drink alcohol (which is good), but I believe that it was the reason why my root canal healed in less than two days after surgery. I had surgery on my front tooth (#25) treating my root canal @ 1pm Monday afternoon. And by Tuesday night, I was off pain Jed's and munching on popcorn! Not to mention that I had no swelling at all. What else can it be if not all the nutrients I am getting in addition if my food onus motion. I have moved on to the chocolate flavor and mix it with almond milk and one banana. It is it so good

review/text: I can not say enough good stuff about this protein shake.  I scoop it into my blender ball in the morning shake and drink.  The whole process take 1 minute and I'm not hungry again until lunch time!  It tastes great, sort of like gazpacho and It could not be more important to get enough leafy green veggies in anywhere we can! At less than $3.00 a shake, it is also a great price to pay for a quick nutritious no fuss breakfast that leaves you no clean up.

review/text: I tried all 3 flavors of amazing meal. I didn't like the vanilla chai (unless a big squeeze of chocolate syrup was added). I did like the chocolate and the mango one. I mix them with almond/coconut milk in a shaker cup, and take it in the car for an easy breakfast.  It's a little gritty (I've never tried anything other than w/ a simple shaker cup), but it's not chalky. As long as your expectations are in line with what this is (raw, vegan, etc and NOT a chocolate milk shake from the ice cream shop), it's a good meal replacement shake.

review/summary: Unbelievable Product
review/text: This is my first amazon review - I had to write about this product because I cannot believe how great it really is. Initially it was a little odd to take down - it mixes in green to water and has a "different" taste, but no aftertaste like many of these products. I took it for a few days and I cannot believe how I FEEL on this. Its not just energy, its just a good feeling that comes over me the entire day after downing this stuff in the morning. I was just sitting at work wondering why I was feeling so good and what I was doing that was different, and then it came to me. They have single serving packs they sell at whole foods. I bought them all. I dont know what it is about the combination of ingredients in this product, but its truly amazing. It doesnt just elevate your energy, it elevates your mood and your very being. Try it and see. You get used to the taste and ive had MUCH more offensive stuff. 5 stars all the way

review/summary: Good Breakfast Option
review/text: After reading the reviews I was slightly nervous about how this product would taste, but I found that when mixed with fruit and ice in the food processor it wasn't so bad. That being said it isn't delicious either, it's just okay and as tastes will differ you kind of have to try it and see. Also I didn't notice any increase in energy, but if I drink it for breakfast I often feel hungrier throughout the day as if it jump starts my metabolism. Overall, I like this shake as an option for breakfast it provides nutrients without weighing me down and tends to make me want to eat throughout the day, which is good for me because otherwise I wouldn't.

review/summary: New to Nutrition---Uhh Newtrition?
review/text: So basically I realized about 3 weeks ago that I hadn't eaten anything but sandwiches, burgers, or fast food, for as long as I could actually remember. I'm 22 and absolutely have not been eating my vegetables. I'm not overweight, because I don't really eat very much, maybe 2 meals a day, but I wanted to make sure I was healthy and nutritious. I started taking a Multi-V (GNC Men's Energy) but needed to it with food, and I normally do not eat breakfast, so I found Amazing Meal.<br /><br />This certainly, by no means, tastes like pomegranate or mango. Get that thought out of your head now and you'll be much better off. It tastes like hay/magic mushrooms with an undefinable whiff of fruitiness (not sweet).<br /><br />To get this down easiest, I mix a half scoop of the powder with a small amount of water, maybe 1 cup. I stir it up until it is very dark colored but not sludgy. I chug that down followed by some clean water. Not to bad. Then I take a quarter scoop of the powder and make a smoothie (frozen strawberries, frozen cranberries, frozen raspberries, half a banana, almond milk, Greek yogurt, and 2 teaspoons of coconut oil (I'm working slowly up to 2 tablespoons)).<br /><br />That's my breakfast. I also take 1 Alpha Brain each day and 2 ShroomTech Immune every other day. It is completely night and day from when I ate unhealthy and didn't take any nutrients. Just three weeks ago. Pretty nuts.

review/text: First of all I was very surprised to get this so fast. I just ordered it yesterday and it was at my doorstep before 11 am. ( which never happens) anyway I opened it and had a serving and was shocked that it tasted pretty good. Now for those who have tried vegan drinks you know that they are not always the best tasting thing but this is definitely one of the better drinks I have had. I will be reordering this and I will now try the other flavors and hope they are as good as this one.

I ran out of my amazing grass for a week or so and did not know at to do with myself, I love the stuff. I use it as a meal replacement and I do believe it makes me feel great! I have to eat on the go alot and this fills me up and keeps my energy levels up so i dont feel hypo-glycemic. Lost a few pounds too! cant argue with that! I mix it with half water(mixes better) and vanilla or chocolate almond milk and its a great healthy alternative to a fast food meal, and I'm begining to think food is over-rated anyway.

I LOVE the chocolate flavor. So now that I have a winner, every morning I make a smoothie with plain soy milk, 3 ice cubes, 3 frozen strawberries,throw in some blueberries, half a banana (or whatever fruit I have), some water and a scoop of the chocolate Amazing Grass and drink it during my commute. I feel great, have more energy and honestly, it keeps me regular!

review/summary: Easy on the stomach
review/text: Atleast for me it is. I have tried many meal replacements over the years and so far could not find any that were easy to digest. Eating food is even difficult for me with how my health is and after trying chocolate infusuion a year ago I quickly fell in love.<br />I can honestly say that this does NOT taste like grass. It has a very bold and delicious chocolate flavor. Mix it with some lightly sweetened vanilla almond milk and its more than flavorful! I admit if you just shake up or mix it in a cup it will be a little lumpy or grainy but I love the texture. My husband always puts it in a blender which makes the consistency like a thin milkshake, especially if you add blueberries which I highly recommend.I Drink it every morning and it holds me over for 3-4 hours depending if I eat fruit or something along with it. Dont care much for the other flavors but still need to try the chai vanilla.

review/text: I used this in a smoothie and my son and I loved it. It is not just a meal replacement or energy/vitamin drink it is made from whole super foods, which means it is extremely good for you. I wouldn't compare it to something from GNC that isn't superfood based. Buying whole food vitamins is very costly, and this is a good cost for what is delivered, without having to take mounds of large pills to get the same result. We are not completely vegetarian, but we do not eat red meat, and we do not eat fast and junk food. We only eat real food, but even then it is easy to favor certain items over others. I wanted something to balance my diet and hopefully improve my over-all nutrition. Will be buying more, and continuing to improve the health of my family with items like this. Next stop... super mushrooms!

review/summary: It is an amazing meal
review/text: Pros - Good clean energy that does not make me instantly sleepy or wear out after an hour.<br /><br />Cons - The biggest hurdle with this stuff is getting it blended into anything.  It is very stubborn and likes to form chunks.  The taste is weird and texture is like drinking wet sand.<br /><br />The energy boost was enough to drive me into several weeks of experimentation.  My best advice is to put this into a smoothie or milkshake of some sort.  It will be a gritty smoothie but still better than attempting to drink it in water or milk.  I have also baked it into cookies which worked out really well.  Strangely enough it levels off the initial sugar rush you'd get from the cookies and you don't experience a crash afterwards.<br /><br />It is interesting stuff to experiment with for sure.  I'll definitely keep using it for quick meals.

review/summary: Tasty Way to Get Your Veggies and Vegan Protein
review/text: I usually make my own green smoothies at home.  But for work and travel, need a more easy alternative.  I've tried a LOT of commercial "green" powder and most tasty seriously nasty and a few are tolerable but nothing to write home about.  This is by far my most favorable flavor and product.  I get all my serving of greens and also a great source of protein (better than yogurt and equal to some protein bars).  This is what I have for breakfast every morning.  I leave the can in the office and just mix it with water.  When I travel, I take the individual travel packs with me.  I can actually say this product is tasty, but like all protein powder, it does has that gritty protein powder texture.  But if you're used to protein powders, this should be familiar.  Other than the grittiness, it tastes like a light chocolate shake (if you use soy or almond milk, texture will be thicker). I sometimes do juice but usually just water. I've tried the other flavors and they don't taste as good, at least for me.

I am buying this Amazing Grass by the truckload, still love it and I am also adding something called Protein<br />Greens by Orac-Energy. I also add a table spoon of Whole Husk Psyllium purchased here on Amazon which works very well and also thickens the drink. The strong chocolate flavor hides the taste from those two products I add. It all makes for a fantastic breakfast.

review/summary: Best Meal Drink Powder Mix I Have Tried
review/text: I have tried several meal replacement products, and make note that Amazing Grass has this Amazing Meal and also a SuperFood drink powder that looks similar and the same flavors, so I am not sure what the difference actually is, but the word "Meal" in the title meant to me that it was more likely what I was looking for than just a supplement powder. Anyway, the whole family got on a health kick after Mom got cancer and we tried to find the healthiest yet easiest to stick with supplements. After learning of the incredible benefits of wheat grass and the other ingredients in this mix (and yes I know you don't get the full benefit of the wheat grass unless it is freshly cut, juiced and immediately ingested), I decided to give this a try.  Although it doesn't keep me from being hungry for more than a few hours, that is with any typical meal that is intended for small portions anyway, it is very satisfying both with substance and taste. My suggested blending one full scoop of the powder with either 10 ounces of Almond, rice, flax or soy milk (or combination), and then one packet of stevia (I personally use Sweet Leaf) and blend with 1/2 cup or so of ice. Any more ice and the consistency is not liquid enough to drink without letting melt or watering down with more milk. I have found the small bit of stevia removes a lot of the in your face grass taste some others have mentioned, and I truly enjoy drinking this rather than having to slam down something I don't enjoy just to get the benefits.

review/text: My doctor recently suggested that I try going Gluten Free to possibly alleviate some of the allergy and sinus issues I have been experiencing the past six months or so. So I've been looking for easier ways to get all the nutrition I need without having to spend a ton of time and money. I found this product and after checking out the ingredients, I decided to give it a try. I know some of the reviews complain about the taste or consistency of the product, but I ordered this knowing that it probably wasn't going to taste like a McDonald's milkshake. I've only been using it for a couple of days now and only with water, but so far I'm enjoying it. Yes, it's a little grainy but I suspect if I mix it with coconut milk or greek yogurt, it wouldn't be as evident. The taste is pretty much what I expected, earthy and wholesome. I've been living without sugar or sweeteners for years so I find it pleasant. I will definitely be reordering this or perhaps one of the other flavors/varieties offered by Amazing Grass.

review/summary: Surprised by how much I enjoyed it!
review/text: I put a serving in the blender with half non homogenized grass-fed organic whole milk and half the same milk but skim, and maybe it's because I love healthy tasting food and greens and have not had chocolate in a long time, but I personally LOVED it. It made me feel good about eating chocolate flavored food. I got a small packet of it to try first. You might want to do the same if you have a whole foods, or mrs greens around you. I will be purchasing this big tub within the week! It's important to me that this is gluten free too because I'm discovering just how sensitive to it I am by avoiding it for the time being and I can share it with my mother and my gluten sensitive friends!

review/summary: Not too shabby for a health powder
review/text: Yes, this powder is essentially grass and all that good stuff you can't bear to stomach on it's own. But if you know that going into trying it, it's not so bad. I like to blend mine with almond milk and berries. Almond milk alone doesn't quite do it for me, but the berries add another dimension. If you're one this people who tend to gag easily, this may not be for you. For everyone else who is looking for a health supplement, it's a must try .

review/text: My husband started taking amazing meal.  He did it as a replacement to other "weight lose" drinks that are full of junk. We found this and know both of us are on this. It is a little chakey but it leaves you feel good and satisfied. We love that it is organic too

review/summary: Great Meal Replacement Supplement
review/text: We use this in a smoothie mix as a meal replacement. The taste is good and mild, not as strong of an after taste as egg or soy protein and the texture is smooth, not blended.

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: I bought a single serving pouch to try (on sale) and liked it enough to buy a tub.  For whatever reason the single serving (pouch) seemed tastier (and gave me some 'pep') while the stuff in the tub didn't seem quite as 'chocolaty' (and I didn't notice much if any 'pep').  Kinda made me wonder if the single servings aren't made a little different but it's possible for different batches to vary in taste and effect.<br /><br />Regardless, I like it a lot. From both a nutritional and taste perspective I don't think Amazing Meal can be beat.  I don't eat nearly as much fruits and vegetables as I'd like so I really appreciate the punch of nutrients Amazing Meal packs.<br /><br />I think Amazing Grass has done an awesome job of taking a huge amount of healthy ingredients and turning them into something that tastes, if not good, at least not bad (try putting a scoop of dried greens in your breakfast drink and see how that tastes - this is WAY better!).  I don't find the taste of Amazing Meal at all bad as some people have said.  Everybody's different - if your not sure you want to commit to a whole tub go to PCC and pick up a single serving.<br /><br />The stuff in the tub wasn't super chocolaty but you can get more chocolate flavor by using chocolate milk (or chocolate almond milk) or varying quantities of whatever milks you like to adjust the sweetness/chocolate to suit your taste (I use 3/4 regular milk to 1/4 chocolate almond milk).  You could always toss in some of your own cocoa powder for that matter.<br /><br />I came up with a breakfast shake that I like a lot that holds me easily for several hours by using a combination of protein powders (Amazing Meal & Whey), 1/4 c raw oats, 1 tbl wheat germ, 1 tbl omega oil (I'm using walnut oil right now), 1/2 c blueberries and sometimes a heaping spoonful of greek yogurt (sometimes I add almond butter which is REALLY good also!).<br /><br />The point I'm trying to make is that you can play around with the ingredients to come up with whatever suits YOUR taste and 'staying power'.  I couldn't make it through to lunch on the Amazing Meal alone but along with the other ingredients I add it plays a huge part in satisfying my hunger for several hours (Whey alone doesn't work for me).<br /><br />Everybody's tastes and needs are different - play around with different combinations of ingredients that you like until you find what works well for YOU.<br /><br />I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because of the difference in taste/effect between the single serve and the tub.  I'm on my second tub of Amazing Meal but trying the 'Vanilla Chai' this time just to change things up a bit.

review/summary: Price is meh but flavour is decent
review/text: I bought the chocolate infusion. I mixed it with organic whole milk, not using the full 10 ounces, and thought it was pretty drink-able. Not amazingly chocolate-y, but enough that I could chug it without feeling too "healthy". Definitely not something I'd savor though.<br /><br />It did mix up pretty smooth, with little of the clumps that just won't die and had a good texture.<br /><br />All the reviews I read said that they felt energized and full for a long time after they drank it. I drank it at about 2pm and didn't feel particularly full afterwards and now at near 4pm I'm feeling positively hungry. Meal replacement? Perhaps not.<br /><br />Also, I'm still feeling really sleepy so that whole energizing thing? Nah.<br /><br />Noting, a lot of the reviews I read were done around 2009 and were done with free samples. I'm wondering how much of their glowing reviews was based off of psychosomatic happy feelings on getting a relatively good tasting drink to experiment with, how much of it was due to them being people who were already pretty healthy to begin with ( also known as the raw/vegan/scary type who CAN easily subsist off of meal replacement shakes) and how much of it was that Amazing Grass had a better product back then and has since declined in quality.<br /><br />Not to be cynical, but I've noticed that the first year or so of a company putting out a product, they tend to have amazing stuff, and then it usually goes downhill after that. And then there are the others that get bought out and just suck after that. Naked Juice, Burt's Bees, I'm looking straight at you.<br /><br />Meh. I guess I'll finish this container since I already paid for it, but I doubt I'll be back for more.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: Thoroughly love this product and used it for the past few years, but incredibly disappointed that they made their packaging larger (and thus more waste) and the quantity within smaller such that servings remained the same but serving size decreased (and thus increasing price). I really respected their product until this shift a few months ago, and have since been looking for a new product.

review/summary: This is nasty..and I LOVE green smoothies.
review/text: I've been drinking Amazing Grass' Chocolate version for months and just ADORE it.  I decided to try the Mango Amazing Meal and was very turned off by the texture and flavor.  I'm sure the texture issue has to do with the dried mango.  I tried it with both almond milk and coconut milk, adding 1/2 frozen banana.  It turned out way too sweet as I didn't realize it already has sweetener in it.  Without the banana, it wasn't any better.  I still have quite a bit left...I will try it with OJ as someone else commented on doing.  Hope that improves the taste!

review/summary: Gross, use GNC light meal instead.
review/text: I bought this and tried it twice. This tastes like someone added cocoa to grass clippings. It is that awful.  GNC has some very good tasting natural products I would recommend first. Optimum nutrition lean shake and Myoplex are good options for tasty protein (whey) fiber, and vitamins.<br /><br />You aren't going to diet long if your meals taste like this. It is torture.  2 stars for healthy content, 0 stars for drinkability (and I have tried some pretty bland health stuff).  Save some money, just eat some grass and raw eggs.

review/text: It actually tastes like a strawberry smoothie. It's starts out cold, just like IceBreakers Ice Cubes should. Then it tastes like strawberries, not just like flavored sugar. To top it off, this gum seems to last forever. If you prefer fruity gum to minty gum, you should give this a try.

review/summary: My Favorite Bread Mix
review/text: This is the best bread mix I've ever tasted.  I bought my bread machine approximately six months ago.  I have purchased quite a variety of different bread mixes, but I have to admit that the majority of loaves I've baked have been using this mix.  The smell as it is baking is incredible.  My family raves about it.  I never let on that I didn't have to slave in the kitchen to make the delicious homemade bread that they all love so much.  One tip I've found is that if I leave the loaf in the bread machine, even after the whole cycle has completed, until I am ready to serve the bread, the texture is amazing.  It is so moist, soft...just perfect.
