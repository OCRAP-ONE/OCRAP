review/summary: Very good purshase
review/text: After our local Aldi stopped carrying the similar product I was used to buying, I was very happy to find Mestemacher Whole Rye bread on Amazon. This is very close to the Russian whole rye bread that I grew up with. I am glad it was that easy. This bread freezes great and will last me for a while. I will buy another case when the first batch will be gone. Thanks,<br />Anna

My wife and I could eat the various Mestemacher varieties on a daily basis.  We believe it is a very healthy product as well as tasting terrific.

review/summary: Just Received the Rye Absolutely Delicious
review/text: Just received the 12 pack of rye and toasted the first slice and spread a little peanut butter on it --delicious, chewy and a little sweet and nutty (not from the peanut butter) ---  not like typical grocery store bread -- thin slices but very hearty. Loaves are about one third the size of a normal loaf but probably weigh almost as much. Reminds me of bread I used to get at a Danish restaurant served as the base for open-faced sandwiches. The 12 loaves fit easily on one shelf of my side by side freezer. A very tasteful way to consume fiber. About same calories per slice as whole grain wheat bread I usually eat but these slices are longer and cut in half will make a nice sandwich. Salt and carbs may be higher -- compare to bread you usually eat.<br /><br />If the distributor reads this, I'd suggest a variety pack of 12 so one may try the whole selection.

review/summary: Not as expected for rye bread, but...
review/text: I'm disabled and don't get to the grocery store much at all, so bread is something I generally miss out on. So I was excited to see this offered. I just received it and tried it. It does not resemble grocery store bread (in US). The only thing I can compare it to is some health food store sprouted grain yeastless bread that I ate 30 years ago - from my memory it tastes exactly like that did.<br /><br />The expiration date on it is April 2012, so I don't think I will even need to freeze it, which is nice. I'm not anticipating any problem enjoying it, just that it does lack the sort of familiarity I was expecting.

review/summary: Spicy and Fishy
review/text: Let me start off by saying, I love Nong Shim bowl noodles!  At this price, I couldn't pass them up!<br /><br />I prefer the original spicy, but decided to give the Spicy Seafood a try this time.  There is a fishy scent, which I found unappealling at first, but have since learned to live with.  Also, this variety is not nearly as spicy as I would prefer, and certainly less spicy than the original flavor bowls.  There are bits of dried crab and shrimp in the bowls, along with nice size pieces of mushroom and green onion (and other vegetables as well).  As with other Shim products, the noodles taste great and seem to be a better quality than other brands of instant noodles.<br /><br />I add a few dashes of tabasco, black pepper and a pinch of garlic powder before adding the water.  This takes care of the fishy smell (for the most part) and brings the spiciness level up as well.

Sometimes I'll add some frozen sweet white corn instead. I just think they make a great quick snack. I don't think they're as bad for you as some people say as long as you don't drink the broth which I don't do. I'm sure I pour a lot of the sodium down the drain!

The separate seasoning package is a nice touch, allowing you to season to your liking by putting in more or less of the powder to suit for taste.  The bowl seamed to be a little less spicy than the package....but it is perfect for me.  I am buying more as soon as I run out.

review/text: These instant noodles pack a good amount of fat and sodium.  You shouldn't be eating this every day but oh man is it tasty.  I normally just make a bowl at night time when I got the munchies.  You can reduce the amount of sodium by using less of the package of flavoring and not drinking the soup, but what's the fun in that?  Great for a quick snack, but beware the sodium and fat!  Try throwing a few boiled shrimps in with your noodles.  Taste even better!

review/summary: Watch Out: This Gave Me "Pine Mouth"
review/text: I love the taste of Mrs. May's products, but the Sesame Crunch gave me "Pine Mouth."  Sesame Crunch is made in China, and contains pine nuts.  Chinese pine nuts, as well as certain other pine nuts, can cause you to have a horrible taste in your mouth for up to two weeks after ingestion.  Everything you eat tastes bitter or soapy.  I've had it for five days now -- blech.  No more Sesame Crunch for me.

review/text: These sesame crunch cubes are delicious.  They are like little cubes of crunchy granola without the excess sweetness.  Pure sesame seed flavor, not masked by salt and other spices.  They're low in sugar and high in fiber, calcium, iron.  I can't get enough, and I don't feel guilty eating them.  What a treat.

review/summary: I'm Addicted!!! Love, Love, Love The MMMaple Bars!
review/text: I recently ran across this product in a discount store. I had never heard of it or the company but the product description, nutritional information, and low price helped me to decide to give it a try. I couldn't believe how delicious these bars are!!! If you love anything maple flavored you will definitely love this one - it also reminds me of this heavenly home-made rich buttered pecan ice cream that we used to get from a local shop as a child that has since gone out of business. The texture is fabulous!!! The flax seeds and chopped pecan pieces along with the sweet maple syrup, molasses and oats are superb! Unlike many bars that are so hard you can break a tooth trying to bite into them. All of their products are USDA certified organic and vegan. Ten grams or more of whole grains, 21% daily recommended serving of ALA Omega-3's in one bar, no white flour, nor high fructose corn syrup, or trans fat!!! I also really appreciate the company's sensitivity to wasteful packaging - the bars come in an EnviroBox. They have reduced their box size by 36%, which saves 472,000 gallons of water, 100,000 pounds of waste, and almost 400,000 CO2 equivalents per year! Nature's Path is on the right path - literally! Due to a medical problem, I have been living on cereal and oat bars and yogurt for well over 2 years now - it's virtually all I can eat. I'm so glad I stumbled across this product! I would urge everyone to try it and I would easily give it 10 stars if I could!!! They are also great for a snack or meal on the go - I always keep a few in my pocketbook. Thank you also to Amazon for offering it and making it so easy with the Subscribe and Save program - now that I'm disabled it is very difficult for me to get out of the house on my own. I think others feel the way I do because once I found out how much I loved them I sent a friend back to buy more and they were all gone! After hunting all over 2 counties we found a few more boxes but I never want to be without these again. Now I just place my order on the computer and it is at my front door in just a few days - so, so happy!!!!!!! I've also tried several other flavors in this line and they are all great but this is my favorite. Amazon carries others that we haven't seen in our stores locally, so I'm looking forward to trying more bars from Nature's Path as well!

review/summary: Nong Shim won a ChefsBest Award with this flavorful ramen
review/text: If your only ramen experience was a dry, tasteless brick dumped into a pot of bowling water that you purchased six for a dollar, then you are in luck. Once you try a Nong Shim noodle bowl you will never go back to Nissin Top Ramen.<br /><br />Nong Shim delivers a flavorful instant noodle meal, balancing seasoning and spice for a perfect lunch on a cold, winter day. The noodle bowl has a rich, red broth that is visibly loaded with spices. I've recommended Nong Shim to many people but a few, because of the kimchi flavor, have been hesitant to give it a try. I can attest that Nong Shim's noodles are not as pungent as `fresh' kimchi.<br /><br />I submitted two product photos. Please give them a look. One shows the ChefsBest Award and endorsements Nong Shim received. Nong Shim is the leading brand of ramyoen (ramen instant noodles) in South Korea.<br /><br />I recommend adding refrigerator scraps to your noodles; perhaps, whole kernel corn (for sweetness) or some tofu, finely chopped green onions (scallions), chopped, cooked beef, chicken or seafood. An egg is another delicious addition, either hard boiled and chopped or over easy.<br /><br />One final note: a serving is high in sodium, so skip drinking the soup if that is a concern as the noodles themselves contain little sodium. You can reduce your sodium intake by more than 60 percent if you don't drink the soup.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.

review/summary: THE preferred noodle of the Bering sea fleet
review/text: Hands down, Nong Shim produces a quick snack/meal. After working aboard vessels on the Bering for 12 years I've come to the conclusion that this little bowl has become the epitome for a meal if you don't have time, want to pass on the food offered in the Galley or trying to survive during the down time when the catch has run dry and boredom sets in causing the munchies.<br /><br />I've seen lots of combos with this one-Vienna sausages, Spam, Albacore tuna, Sardines, Chilies, Three crabs & Maggi, Peanut butter, cumin and beans...<br /><br />Sodium-yes, it's packed with a wallop of the stuff, but when you're grinding 12 to 16 a day you burn it off pretty fast. For those worrying about MSG then just set the spice pack aside and work the noodles with the condiment of choice to your liking.<br />The noodles hold up to a hot broth and don't get soft like a lot of the other brands. Prep time is + 2 minutes. Inexpensive, and a good quick meal if you treat it right.

review/summary: Tastes GREAT, but not very good for you at all...Sodium content is CRAZY high!
review/text: I don't often purchase food items with a laundry list of ingredients, (especially when you need a PhD in chemistry just to pronounce them), however I purchased this Bowl Noodle Soup just to have on hand for a rare occasion when I have nothing here to eat.  I have to say that I LOVE the flavor-spicy and yummy, however, I almost had a heart attack when I read the sodium content is 1021 mg (43% RDV), but wait...that's only for half a bowl of soup!!!!  So this handy, dandy convenient soup bowl packs over 2000 mgs of salt!  You can do what I did and not put the entire packet of seasoning in, which would cut down on the sodium and it still tastes really good.  I'd give it 5 stars were it not for all the chemical ingredients and high sodium content.

review/summary: Spicy!
review/text: I've been a fan of the Cup of Noodles type things for years now. They're cheap, and they're usually pretty tasty. Recently, my local grocery store started carrying the Nong Shim bowl noodles, so I tried a couple flavors, and absolutely fell in love. I'm a huge fan of spicy food, and these are as spicy as they get. I would give it 5 stars, but, like most freeze-dried products, they don't always cook very well. It depends a lot on the temperature of the water, and how long you let it sit. Not really this company's fault specifically, but it is an inherent flaw in the concept of freeze-dried food. Still, this is the best brand of its kind, and the Kimchi is the best flavor.

review/summary: Tasty, filling ramen, but not every-day.
review/text: I bought this box after trying my first Nong-Shim noodle a few weeks prior. These have lots of taste and aroma. They make a great quick lunch or dinner. Although not advertised on the packaging, these are still spicy and hot; however, not nearly as hot as the ones labeled 'spicy'. I do enjoy these, however they are not something I can eat everyday. However, its probably not healthy to eat instant ramen every day anyways! The size is plenty for me. They fill me up well. Keep a box of tissues around though, as you may experience 'running-nose' due to both the temperature of the broth and the spiciness of the soup. I look forward to buying other Nong-Shim noodle products in the future.<br /><br />Overall: Excellent noodles. Flavor is strong but not over the top. Not nearly as spicy as other flavors(You decide whether that be a good thing or a bad thing). Actual noodle taste of Nong-Shim products is much richer than other brands, which is what I love about Nong-Shim.

review/text: Nong Shim noodle bowls are good quality and have nicely flavored soup bases. This Kimchi flavored choice has good spice and balance with a pinch of the usual dehydrated vegetables and good quality dry noodles. The preparation instructions are clear and accurate. I usually add stuff to soups for more substance. Leftover beef, veggies, tomatoes, or chicken work fine and can add a "meal" status to this product vs the "snack" status. I find the Nong Shim soups to be better than the usual cheaper ramen fare, but usually you get what you pay for! If you want the next step up, try Annie Chun's brand. The Nong Shim noodle bowls are very convenient but none can compete with your mother's or grandmother's homemade versions, in my opinion!

review/summary: Terrific Product!!
review/text: When I got a kitten and took it to the Vet for it's exam and shots, they had given me a sample pack of this product and my kitty loved it-he even learned when I said" kitty want a treat" he would jump up on the counter where his treats are kept! That's why I looked for more and ordered them. He loves them!!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUC7YS">Butler NutriSentials Lean Treats Nutritional Rewards for Cats (six 3.5-oz resealable bags)</a>

review/text: These are a hit with my older female kitty.  I used to get similar treats at the pet store, but either they don't carry them anymore, or PETCO charges about $7 per bag for a 2 oz bag!  She LOVES these, and I like that they're healthy.

review/text: I first got this product at my vet. My cats prefer this to anything else out there.<br />It does contain wheat, which is not naturally what cats eat, so they only get it sparingly.Better ingredients than the other treats out there. The only thing they like more is freeze dried salmon and shrimp, which is very pricey.

review/summary: Great cat treats
review/text: Of all the cat treats out there in the market, this one is by far the favorite for my cat.  She always got a package at Christmas time from a friend and I finally found them here on Amazon.  It's a product I could not locate in any store locally, so I bought a whole case of them.  I don't think you (or your cats!) will be disappointed.

review/summary: Better than the bubble gum kind
review/text: While you can't blow rings of smoke from these, and they don't look quite as realistic, they taste much better than the bubble gum kind of cigarettes, and last much longer. Definitely recommended for kids and adults of all ages. Lots of fun!<br /><br />Edit: I purchased a box of these cigarettes from this seller, and while the candy is good, 50% of them were broken in shipping. I bought these for mainly the appearance of the cigarettes, which doesn't work out too well when most of the candy sticks are snapped in half.  In an attempt to fix this, I went through all 24 boxes of candy, dumped out the ones that were broken, and filled the boxes with as many whole cigarettes as would fit (about 25 in each box), which left me with about 6 boxes of 150 whole cigarettes. I still give this product four stars because there were still many whole cigarettes left, and while the fragments can't be used for show, they are still delicious and don't have to be thrown out. In the future I plan on buying this product at a candy store instead of online, to avoid the broken candy.

review/summary: Great snack but be careful when eating...
review/text: These rice crackers are an awesome low calorie snack that packs a nice punch of flavor.<br /><br />The crackers themselves are nice, crisp and crunchy, great for when you want something that goes crunch but don't want potato chips or something else that is less then healthy for you.<br /><br />They taste great, somewhat sweet at first, then the wasabi flavor kicks in and it's this perfect balance.<br /><br />However the only complaint I have is that the wasabi flavoring is in a somewhat powder form, so if you are inhaling as you take a bit, the wasabi flavor will rush right down your windpipe punching and kicking as it goes down, possibly causing you to cough every once and a while. So you kinda have to be careful when popping this tasty little treats.<br /><br />I just loves these because they curve your appetite and give you that crispy, crunchy thing you want in a snack, all without them being horrible for ya.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great flavor.<br />Really fits the bill when you want something crunchy to munch on.<br />Low in calories, fat free, and VERY few ingredients.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Wasabi dust very hazardous to your health, use caution while eating these.

review/summary: Good crackers, bad supplier
review/text: I LOVE these crackers, especially with sushi (I get the fresh-packed from the grocery store). However, after ordering a carton of these crackers, I had to quickly put them all in freezer bags because ALL of the packages had a hole in them and there were cracker crumbs all over the place. I should have been able to take the packages out of the box and store them away in my cabinets without worrying about roaches crawling into the rips in the bags and getting a wasabi high.

review/summary: Salty n Spicy....perfect combination!
review/text: This is my first time trying beef jerky.  Was so happy when I discovered that halal jerky existed and so I immediately ordered the Hot Hickory flavor.  Got the package fairly quickly due to Amazon Prime.  I don't know what beef jerky should taste like, but I enjoyed this.  The texture was dry, but not completely dry.  Had some moisture in it.  The pepper flakes are all over the thin beef strips.  I tasted the salt, soy sauce, and the pepper flakes.  There is not a strong hickory flavor though, which I would have enjoyed if it was there.  Overall, great product!

review/text: This isn't my first time trying beef jerky. I have tried it already but not a halal version which I thought would be different. I know it is usually too chewy for some but it can be okay if you just want to try something unusual and don't have a lot of time. Now I don't usually enjoy spicy foods unless it is Korean or Chinese but this seems okay. In fact I love the peppery flavor it doesn't seem to be overdone. It's one of those things to try to say you did. I haven't tried anything halal before except for toothpaste a boyfriend got for me at a Dollar store years ago. He was Italian but that was nice of him to think of that for me. I would really recommend this it is very good.

review/text: I was fed up with buying Jack Links at my local grocery store only to come home and realize that I got a bag full of plastic squares dyed reddish brown.  Seriously, Jack Links is absolutely disgusting and has nearly the exact same consistency of a credit card, so I decided to look for a better alternative.  I found this Halal Jerky product.<br /><br />This jerky was one of the best retail bagged beef jerky products I've had. Full of flavor, chewy but not hard and plasticy, and made from beef without hormones or antibiotics.<br /><br />It can't compare to locally or home made jerky, but it's definitely one of the better bagged jerky's I've had.  I'd recommended it.

review/text: I got my 3 month old puppy this starter set.  Like most reviewers, my puppy:<br />a: chewed on the flexi-chew chicken bone for a long time<br />b: ignored the white durachew bone<br />c: devoured the edible chew bacon bone<br /><br />I will definitely buy her the flexi-chew bones.  People are right about the pieces breaking off in chunks larger than `rice' size, but the package says that "rice-sized pieces should pass."  I don't think that means it will break in rice-sized pieces; it means that in the event a rice-sized piece breaks off and the dog swallows it, it should pass...should I type rice-sized piece one more time?  I just did.  My pup chewed off pieces that were consistently larger than rice-sized (Oh! Did it again!) and spent a good 5min. trying to chew each piece down if I could not stick my fingers in her throat to grab it.  I crate my pup and would not let her have this bone in the crate because of the pieces that break off.  Also, it is down to a size that would easily fit in her mouth so that she could attempt to swallow, which means it is going in the garbage for a brand new one.<br /><br />The white durachew bone will be saved for when she has her adult teeth and wants to chew on something forever.<br /><br />The edible bacon bone will be left in the wind since she gets treats as it is.  I was honestly thinking, "WTF?" when she crushed it in 5min until I realized it was the edible chew.  She loved it, but it might've spoiled her dinner...probably not, but still...it's funny to think that.<br /><br />Anyway, is it worth it to get this pack? Yes.  One Nylabone is about $4.  You get this pack for about $7.  If your pup doesn't go for the durachew now, s/he will in a month or 2 (depending on age).  You can also see how your pup reacts to the bacon bone: okay potties or loose potties.  Then, you have an idea of where you should you invest your money.
