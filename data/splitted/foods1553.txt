review/summary: What a great solution! Better dog food for a great price!
review/text: My wife and I were picking up dog food from the local stores because we really didn't think we had the money to afford better quality food for our two dogs. We were very excited to find this food which is much better quality than what we were getting although I realize there is much better out there. Our Lab has actually put on weight so we have lowered her daily amount. This whole bag lasts us a month with a lab and a beagle/Shepard mix (medium dog). We thought we might be able to decrease the amount they were being feed once we moved to a better dog food, but we were not expecting to do so on the start of the third week. This dog food will be something we order monthly. Our dogs love it, there is less mess outside, our lab's coat looks great (and I think the other just needs a bath) and we have seen a lot less scratching from the lab. Her sores (hot spots) have healed and she is doing much better!<br /><br />I recommend giving this a try! We love it!

review/summary: Diamond's Beef & Meal
review/text: Actually, I wanted to buy a different, cheaper, more pounds per sack type of dog food for my dog, but she is a picky eater and I thought I would see how she liked the Beef Meal & Rice Formula. My current dog only weighs in at 20# so she doesn't eat much and at ten years old I thought she just might need the extra energy benifits. I have not been dissapointed. Anytime she is being fed this dog food she does a little 'happy dance' that tells me she really likes this and it makes me feel good to know that she thinks I am feeding her the best there is.

review/summary: Great dog food at a great price
review/text: I have fed Diamond Naturals dog food for a long time.  It has high quality ingredients that my dogs love.  IMO, if you are feeding a dog with allergies I wouldn't use ANY beef based dog food.  That is why diamond has the lamb and rice version.  My dogs don't have allergies but I feel the lamb & rice has, IMO, better all around ingredients.<br /><br />Sharon

review/summary: High Quality, Best Value, great for my weimaraner
review/text: I was spending $60 per bag on a dog food of dubious quality at PetSmart, and I had trouble getting my dog to eat all his food, so I set out on a search to find a dog food that met three criteria:<br />1. Highly rated<br />2. Cost less than $1/lb<br />3. My weimaraner both likes it and his stomach tolerates it (weims are known for having weak stomachs and allergies)<br /><br />Using dogfoodadvisor.com, I compared the five-star brands to the pricing available online; I found no dog food that cost less than $1/lb. So I began to look at four-star brands; there were only three that I could find for less than $1/lb. and two of those weren't widely available (I'm not driving an hour for dog food). So I "discovered" Diamond Naturals Beef & Rice at a price of $31.79 for a 40 lb bag (Amazon Prime price, shipping included). That's 79ï¿½/lb.<br /><br />One criterion left: my dog had to both tolerate and like the food. Weimaraners are apparently known for having weak stomachs and allergies, so I was worried about spending $40 to find out. This has not been an issue; even better, Maxwell LOVES it. Now the only problem I have is that he might be eating too fast.<br /><br />Great value, highly rated dog food. And Amazon Prime ships in two days for free. The dog and I are both happy.

review/summary: Our dog enjoys the food - quality seems about the same as Science Diet
review/text: We moved from Science Diet lamb and Rice to Diamond Beef and Rice.  Our dog, a 8 year old 75lb Rhodesian Ridgeback, enjoys the food (she enjoys all food.)and we're feeding her the same amount as before with no changes in weight since the switch.  We're on our 2nd bag and I believe this is a good quality mid grade food and we will continue to use it as it offers good nutrition at a great value.  I appreciate more than anything that Diamond has not increased price by reducing the weight of the bag.  10 years ago a 40lb bag was standard and now most brands are selling their "big bags at 35lbs or even less.  Just like with people food, price increases are often disguised with reduced quantity in similar packaging.  Bravo to Diamond for not jumping on that bandwagon!

review/text: My dogs love the Diamond Naturals Beef and Rice. I have a large shephard mix and a large terrier mix and they've both taken to this food with a gusto. I switched them to this b/c my terrier mix developed skin problems.  Since hes been on the new food, he's all good.  The only downside is they love it so much they're getting a little chunky now. I'm going to have to slow their rolls. :)

review/text: The food is probably good, but it gave my dog severe diarrhea...I ended up feeding all of it to her, sometimes decent, usually mushy. It sucked!

review/summary: Great price for the quality! Dog and dog mom are happy.
review/text: I switched to this food from buying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139TT72">Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 12.5-Pound Bag</a> with subscribe and save through Amazon when I needed something less expensive, but still wanted a dog food with meat as the first ingredient. Not an easy feat! So many foods I found at stores advertised catch phrases like a "natural" and "organic," but still started with a non-meat ingredient.<br /><br />I found Blue Diamond at a great Austin grocery store in bulk for about $1 a pound and decided to make the switch. My dog isn't a picky eater; he loved the new food, but he'd probably get excited about anything different. When I moved out of state, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find this brand, but Amazon saved the day again! Now I'm paying about 79 cents a pound for the beef flavor (which he likes just as well as the lamb) vs. $1.76 for the Newman's Own.<br /><br />The only downfall: I think this food may have given him bad breath - I noticed a certain oral aroma that seems to have started about the time we switched, but I'm not confident enough to say it was definitely from the food. Still, I'm giving him Proden Plaqueoff Animal now. It apparently takes a long time to work, but I think I've seen a bit of improvement over the last few weeks. Plus it's supposed to help with his plaque, so if bad breath is an issue on this food, try that.

review/text: I just bought this brand of dog food for the first time because I was trying to find a cost effective quality food for my dogs. Not a week after it arrived, I hear on the radio that they have had to recall because people not pets were getting salmonella poisoning from handling the food. Thankfully my wife and I were able to avoid that unnecessary risk to our health!!! Now I had to waste my precious time to get the food out of my house and fill out their recall paperwork. Fail.

review/summary: Good Quality at a Good Price
review/text: I found this to be the best bargain for a higher quality dog food, comparable to Wellness and Blue Buffalo. My dogs both love it and one of my dogs that often gets topical yeast infections does not have problems on this food so its not full of bread filler. The only other food comparable for my dog's yeast problem is Wellness and it got too pricy for me.  I did notice a salmonella recall on the Diamond lamb flavor, spring of 2012, so I keep an alert on my google news,  but its the only recall I've seen and it went public fast, right on the Diamond site and there were no fatalities because it was dealt with well.  Still, good to know.

review/summary: Diamond Natural Dry Food
review/text: Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Dog, Beef and Rice Formula does not seem to agree with my cocker spaniel. I ordered it because it was highly rated for nutritional value and also recommended for dogs inclined to get chubby. I followed the directions on the bag and introduced it slowly, but it still gave him diarrhea and gas. I have now mixed it half and half with another dog food and he is tolerating it better (especially with the help of a probiotic), but once this 40 pound bag is gone I will not reorder it.

review/summary: My 65 LB Boxer Loves Diamond Naturals Beef and Rice
review/text: I was feeding my Boxer pup Nature' Recipe until he was about 10 months.  With the bad economy, I was looking for a cheaper brand, that is a good quality of dog food.  I found the good reviews on the Diamond Natural brand.  I first purchase him the Chicken and rice, but he did not eat it very well, and my Boxer is not a picky eater.  So, I decided to try the Diamond Naturals Beef and rice the next time.  My Boxer, ate it so fast and was looking at me for more.  The price at my local store is only $27.95 for a 40 lb. bag.  I am so happy that I discovered this brand for my Boxer and my pocketbook is happy as well!  I sometimes mix the Diamond can food for an extra treat for him! Gr8 dog food!

review/summary: Dogs Love the Taste
review/text: I bought this food based on many online reviews on the nutritional content alone.  However, the dogs absolutely love the taste.  We are trying to mix in the last of the Iams food with this, but it is to the point where 2 of our 3 dogs have started picking the Iams out of the bowl and dropping it on the floor.  It actually makes us feel bad to think we've been feeding them something that they hate for a long time.  Either that, or Iams has somehow changed their ingredient blend, which is very possible.  I first found out about this food from Dog Food Advisor.  It ranks a 4 out 5 on their site, and they seem to break down the reasoning pretty well.<br /><br />If you smell this stuff next to Iams, you'll notice it actually smells like meat, and the Iams smells like a weird grain.  We keep the food in two separate tubs, and you can always notice the difference when you are scooping each one out.

review/summary: Salmonella Recall, but No Refund?
review/text: Amazon Notified me Diamond Naturals was being recalled due to Salmonella in the Food. Great, I'm glad they told us; yes, a month after we bought the food, but luckily, our dog hasn't gotten to it yet. Diamond Naturals says they will give you a replacement Coupon if you mail them the UPC code off the bag. But what if you do like us, and always dump the food into an airtight container to keep vermin out? Presto-Chango! NO UPC CODE. And What do you do if you also Mix your food with another (higher end) brand? There's 60 bucks worth of dog food there that we now have to throw out. Fantastic. What do you do? Well you contact Diamond Naturals, tell them exactly that, and they respond, by saying "If you don't have the Bag, when in doubt, throw the food out. Since we value you as a customer, we're going to give a coupon for more Diamond Naturals, Just cut the UPC code off the Bag and send it to us." ....Really? Hellooooo? Testing...is this thing on? So you email them back, pointing out again, that it's not possible to send them something you don't have, and again asking... "Hey, what about the other food that's ruined too? I have the record of buying them both on the same day from Amazon."  What happens next? Apparently Nothing, No Response, Zip. So, You dump the food in the trash, scrub out the container, and his food bowl just in case, and belly-ache about it here. And end up at Pets-Mart buying a different brand and hoping your dog doesn't get the runs because of the sudden change.

review/summary: Great dog food.. BEST FOR THE MONEY!
review/text: My dog loves this food. Cheaper than so called good food on WALMART and probably as good as other premium food for twice the price; even better for the dogs health. We have a rottweiler and he is about a year old now. This food makes his coat shine, and funny thing makes him behave better. He was TOTW since puppy until 8 months (had skin allergies that come/go), and switched him over to DN Extreme Athlete (skin rash gone). He is a house dog and was always rombumcous I was saying what happened to this lazy rottie puppy; after doing some research I guess its because of the high protein/calorie contents of both foods. This is the cheapest of DN and I switched him over to it since they ran out of DN EA on the feed supply store. Now I have a better behaved dog I am so happy. He is a 1 yr/4 months now and weighs in at 120 lbs. I feed him 3 cups a day, and he is doing very well on this since he was about 11 months. For $25 at my local feed store, I can't go wrong.<br /><br />Check him out on YOutube below:<br />[...]

review/summary: Seems to be good stuff
review/text: Stumbled on a website that ranked dog foods and discovered that our current food - Beneful - had received very low marks.  This food seemed to be the best combination of quality and cost.  Our dogs made the transition to the food without any apparent problems and seem to really like the stuff - they are not picky eaters at all so a handful of sand with chicken broth would probably be OK with them.  No apparent intestinal issues - certainly less gas than with Beneful.  And maybe it's the weather but they seem very energetic - bit too sometimes.  I credit (blame) the food.  Overall, seems to be a great product and the price and the free Amazon shipping make it a good value.

review/text: This is quality dog food at a reasonable price. My dogs love it and they've been doing great since I switched them to this food. Their energy level is excellent and their fur looks good. I love not having to go to store for a heavy 40 lb bag of dog food. It's so convenient to have it shipped to my house.

review/summary: What Am I Paying For?
review/text: We started Betsy, our large pound pup, on Diamond's Lamb Dog Food for Puppies when we got her at 6 months old. Within a few weeks there was a remarkable improvement in her general appearance. She DID poop alot - I've already commented on this issue in my review of the puppy food - but she was so much healthier and happier than when we first got her. She stayed on that until she was 9 months old when we switched her over to Diamond's Beef and Rice Formula for Adult dogs. She did okay with the switch and that seemed to lessen her poops a bit. Then we changed her to Kirkland (from Costco) Chicken and Rice Formula for adult dogs. At first, Betsy did seem to prefer to eat Diamond over the Kirland but it could have been the change from Beef to Chicken rather than the brand switch. The main down side of Diamond is that it's hard to justify buying it when we can get Kirkland, a great Diamond product, for $10-$14 less per 40-lb. bag. Besides, I must admit that I don't really see much of a difference in her coat or her behavior since the change but that could be because she's part terrier (terror) and has a rough/scraggly coat and is only a year old....

review/summary: Probably great for some, but...
review/text: I bought this for my german shepherd because of the label "no wheat, no corn, no soy".  He seems to be sensitive to those things.  After going through a bag of this food, his allergies are worse than ever, he even has scratched bare patches on his hind end now.  I guess he is allergic to barley too.  I wish I had paid better attention, barley is the second ingredient, and is a cereal grain just like wheat.  It's a shame, because my dogs like this food.  I just bought a second bag before I figured out the problem, I'm going to have to donate it and go hunting for another affordable dog food that my shepherd can tolerate.

review/summary: Diamond Food RECALLED
review/text: This is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.I too love Grain Free dog food and love that the first ingredient is actually the real meat.<br />My baby girl loves "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison mainly.<br />I searched relentlessly for a reasonable priced food that has no by-products, dyes and are grain free. Which my lil' white Maltese needed for her allergies and tear stains.<br />But, now Diamond Dog Food has been RECALLED for "Salmonella"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled too.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying.

review/summary: My dog hated it!
review/text: After feeding my dog IAMS chicken naturals for several months, I felt that it was time for a change to what I thought was better, less manufactured dog food. It is safe to say that my dog does not like this food one bit. She will eat my friend's dog food (which is Blue Mountain brand) but will only eat the Diamond Naturals unenthusiastically after what seems like days of letting the food just sit there. I also noticed that her coat lost much of its shine and lustre over the weeks that I was feeding her this food. I understand every dog is different but my dog is a Basenji-mix and I wanted to bring this to the attention of other Basenji owners. I thought I would be getting good quality food judging by the reviews but unfortunately this was not the case. I bought Nutro Ultra instead and she eats it immediately and seems to love it! Buy at your own risk.

review/summary: Still scratching my head...
review/text: A few months ago, I bought a bottle of this amazing olive oil at my local Whole Foods store. My partner and I loved it! Put it on everything! Thought we'd die without it! And then, of course, we went to replace it and couldn't find it in stock. No problem, we thought.<br /><br />Amazon.com has never failed us. We found it quickly, ordered it, it came early, wrapped securely -- everything was perfect, as usual. But then something looked different. The bottle was the same size and color, but the oil was darker. And we noticed that the bottle from Whole Foods had a seal of approval from the North American Olive Oil Association (of all things!) and the one from the web did not. The flavor of the Whole Foods' bottle was zippier, too.<br /><br />Since the North American Olive Oil Association started certifying US oils fairly recently, and because the darker, uncertified oil was a bit flat, I can only assume that the darker, flatter uncertified oil was perhaps from a prior year's harvest (several hours of searching the web for answers turned up nothing). So for me, when it comes to Iliada Kalamata Golden Selection Extra Virgin Olive Oil, I'm going to make sure it has that seal. Next year, when perhaps all olive oils will come with the seal, maybe we should start making them date their bottles?

review/summary: Clean Light Uncolored Taste - not Oily
review/text: I first purchased this product to replenish my "Kalamata Gold" Greek olive oil supply, which suddenly became unavailable. I use this particular olive oil exclusively for stove-top cooking. I haven't used it in salad dressings, or any other cold dishes; though it is probably an excellent choice for salad dressing.<br /><br />I have at least four different kinds of olive oil in my pantry at any given time. Some are floral, some are fruity, some (now discarded) are overpoweringly oily. Iliada Kalamata Greek EVOO is neither floral nor fruity and certainly not oily on the palette, so it is an excellent choice when one doesn't want the oil to impart much flavor of its own. Again, I use this oil for cooking, but it is likely an excellent choice for dressings.

review/summary: Nothing
review/text: Now you may ask why pay to have H20 packed and shipped half way around the world just to be guzzled in a mater of seconds, minutes at the most?<br /><br />Well "nothing" is the reason. Everyday you hear about the odd stuff that is in local water supplies. My favorite statement is "it may look nasty and taste awful but it is perfectly safe." So we turn to bottled water that is everything from the same local water just packaged to fancy mineral water that needs lime to mellow it out. Included in this category is a concoction called drinking water; they take everything out and put back what they guess makes water drinkable. The worst sort of stuff is items packed in colorful plastic bottles that taste like colorful plastic.<br /><br />Evian on the other hand is water the way that nature intended. It goes down smooth and has no after taste. It is refreshing when cooled but can work well even at room temperature.  Gourmet coffee locations use this as the base water because it does not distract from the taste. The water is even used externally for applying and removing makeup. I keep a case in the car incase of any emergency that may come up.<br /><br />There is "nothing" more satisfying.

review/summary: One of the longer lasting chew toys
review/text: I picked up the medium size bone for my miniature schnauzer (not realizing that there was also a small and large size as well) and overall I'm pretty impressed, but not amazed.<br /><br />The nylon bone threads through the tough rubber ball and is secured by simply screwing one end into place over the other.  You can fit one treat on each end as shown (for a total of two) in the picture or opt to have just one treat.<br /><br />Overall the profuct is very durable.  My schnauzer has an unusually strong jaw for his size, and most chew toys don't last long enough to justify their costs.  However, the Busy Buddy does stand up very well and my dog really enjoys the gnawhide treats that come with it.  It's relatively easy to clean and I don't really woryy about any choking hazards here.<br /><br />However, the size of the bone in relative size to the ball doesn't really make for any decent 'bouncing' as the name suggests.  It more or less 'rolls', not bounce.  And I was a bit disapointed it only came with 6 treats to start with.  Though you can buy refill packs with 24 discs, I think the initial outing should come with at least 10 or 12.<br /><br />The discs themselves do indeed last a bit.  Probably because of their placement within the toy itself, it may help add time that it takes yoru dog to enjoy these, giving an impression it lasts longer than other chew toys.  But my schnauzer really does enjoy the treats.  They have a rich smokey/meaty smell and will keep his attention for some time.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this product.

review/text: Wow - my retriever mix dog LOVES this dog toy.  I was hesitant because of the price but considering bully sticks and other nylabones are expensive and don't last long, this one is worth the cost.  My dog obviously loves chewing on the rings but even when they are chewed off, she still chews on the nylabone endings all the time.  We end up only putting on a 2 rings maybe once a week as an extra special treat.  I will say this though - this thing is HEAVY, so watch your toes!  I would only recommend this size for a dog over 50 lbs and a heavy chewer.  Otherise, get the medium size.

review/text: I like this product as do both my Labs (a puppy and an elder).  They like both kinds or gnawhides treats with the busy bone (the smooth and the rough ones).  I would say the only negative is the gnawhides are not available at any local pet stores so we always have to order them on Amazon.  The Everlasting treat (another long lasting treat)is easier to find, but the dogs (especially the puppy) seem to like the busy bone better.  I usually put one treat on at a time to make the treats last longer.

review/text: Daisy is a power chewer and a youthful terrier mix. In trying to work with her to spend time indoors without driving us crazy chasing the cats and jumping on/chewing on furniture, I wanted to find a puzzle. This toy with it's rings is just that. I purchased the medium-large bone and accidentally purchased the medium rings. This was a good accident as the medium large rings were too easy for her to grab and chew off quickly. The medium rings, although they have to be jammed on there more forcefully, are better for the clever mutt. She has also been chewing on the white part of the bone and it is just awful looking BUT she has not destroyed it and that is amazing! It keeps her occupied on her spot on the carpet for an hour at a time. I will probably replace it in a few months when she finally destroys it!

review/text: Good concept in terms of a rubber toy with refillable ringed gnaw treats but the treats get ripped out FAST! too easy an access for the dogs.  Mine ate the first two treats within an hour & the last few within the hours of my refilling it.  If you want them to be amused for a while, better to get a Kong.  If you just want a skeleton of a plastic bone for them to lose interest in, than this is your toy.  It's too hard for him to wrap his mouth around as a gnawing toy so without the treats, its just no longer fun for him.<br /><br />Good quality plastic... but overall bad toy for the purpose its trying to fulfill (the purpose being to have the dog leave you alone for a while)

review/summary: BEST DISTRACTOR EVER
review/text: My dog absolutely loves this toy! I do have a few tips for making the treats last longer...<br /><br />I got the gnawhide rawhide rings as well as the cornstarch rings. The cornstarch rings last a lot longer but also don't have the immediate gratification that the rawhide ones do. I stack one of each on either side, this makes the treat last a lot longer and seems very enjoyable for my pup! Also, the cornstarch rings dry out really quickly and then crack on the toy. Keep them sealed in a plastic baggie.<br /><br />Just a side not, my dog is 5 months old and NOT a hugely destructive chewer. I would rank him as a 7 on a scale of 1-10, so this probably isn't the best toy if you have a 10 on your hands.

review/summary: It keeps him occupied!
review/text: This is one of our 13 month old Samoyed's favorite chews/toys (my chow chow has no interest in it.)  Not only does he like to gnaw on it, but he tosses it all around and chases it. Caution though, I got the large bone and it has some weight to it (almost 2#s.) One time he let it drop, it bounced and hit a ceramic planter causing it to shatter! I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled up on the rawhide rings.  I've had it for five days and he hasn't managed to chew them off yet...but keeps trying!  So far, this has been an indestructible chew toy that has kept him occupied for hours.

review/summary: My Dog's Favorite Toy!
review/text: I was at CVS one day and saw this toy in the dog section.  It was only $8.99 so I didn't think much about it and put it in my cart.  Got home and gave it to my dog, Happy. He absolutely loves this toy over his Kong toys, his tug-of-war toy, his tennis balls ... he chooses this toy over all the others.  I picked it up one day to smell it.  Just curious since he loves it so much.  It has a nice smell to it. I don't know what it smells like to him, but he must like it!  Definitely recommend this to anyone that has a dog that likes to chew and the challenge of getting the treats!  :)

review/summary: Too easy
review/text: This toy provided very little mental stimulation to my dog.  The treat is so exposed and extremely easy to eat off, and the bone so hard and ball so heavy he wanted nothing to do with it after the treat was gone.  We have a heavy chewer, but unless you have a small dog with a small light bite that takes time eating it, I just can't imagine it would be worth the price of buying their own hides to attach.  I would suggest a nylabone first to make sure your dog is interested in chewing on the bone part even when there isn't treats attached.

review/summary: An unusual toy to entertain your chewer
review/text: I bought this item (the large version) for my housemate's mixed Labrador/Spaniel for Christmas. He's a very active dog who likes to chew, sometimes even throwing toys in the air in his play.<br /><br />He LOVED this. It was entirely novel to him, there were lots of textures, and the treats motivated him to play for a continuous 35 minutes until he could eat them.<br /><br />If you're not aware of it from the picture, there's a purple ball slotted over a plastic white bone (which corkscrews to shut within the ball). The treats can be placed on the bone on either side of the ball before corkscrewing the bone into its fixed position. Extra treats come with the toy, and can be bought as needed.<br /><br />I found the entire thing a little heavy, and I think the dog did too. He ended up breaking apart the entire apparatus (to get directly at the treats), and then chased the ball or gnawed at the bone. I think we'll use it with the treats on special occasions, but on a day-to-day basis the dog will use the ball and the bone separately. Effectively this is two toys in one.<br /><br />Highly durable. Even his chewing tendencies were unable to get through each part.

review/summary: Overpriced & Easy to Disassemble
review/text: I bought both the bristle bone and this one, the bouncey bone. When I bought them I thought the high price was easy to justify.  A toy that satisfies a chewing urge, smells yummy, and keeps my dog entertained sounded like a great thing.  The pieces unscrew so you can reload the rawhide rings.  My medium sized dog found it very easy to take it apart, and I found the pieces scattered while he chewed on it under my desk.  It happened so quickly that when I discovered it, he had already started to destroy one of the purple rubber rings on the bristle bone. I wanted to prevent the disassembly trick, so I screwed the pieces together more tightly.  Unfortunately the weak nylon piece broke off when I did that.  There's about $20 down the drain.  Maybe I should have stuck to Nylabones.

review/summary: great for chewers
review/text: My dogs love these! I bought a large one for my chocolate lab and a medium one for my smaller mixed breed. They both prefer the large bone. Both dogs love the rawhide treats.  My lab can get the treats off the bone now in about five minutes or less now, so if you are looking for something to keep your dogs occupied for long periods of time I wouldn't go for this. However, as most people know labs are super smart so your dog might take longer to figure out how to get the rawhides off. It takes my smaller dog about 10-15 minutes to devour her treats.

review/summary: Not indestructible . . . but close!
review/text: I have two labrador retrievers who demolish almost every toy instantly.  These bouncy bones (medium is the right size for my 65# boys) provide hours of entertainment.  They will eventually chew through the bone; but afterwards, they are left with a bouncing ball that stays around for a long, long time.  These toys are worth every dime.

review/summary: Keep away from your dog
review/text: I purchased these based on the "good" reviews that it had received. I have a Shiba Inu who loves to chew and thought this would be the perfect answer. I did not know that the "Gnawhide treats" were so EASY to choke on. After my dog finished his treat, he was choking excessively and threw up everything. I recommend you stay away from this product. FYI, my dog is medium size and I got the so called medium sized treat.

review/summary: Not for my dog
review/text: Purchased this because of all of the great reviews, but this just isn't for my dog.  I have a pit bull who is an enthusiastic power chewer.  On its own,  she wasn't really interested in it.  I put a bit of peanut butter between the gnawhide discs and the rubber ball and she finally got it.  It took her a good 20 - 30 minutes to get both of the treats off, after which she started chewing on the hard plastic bone ends.  Unfortunately, she started gnawing little chunks off of the ends - besides the little pieces of plastic that were coming off, the chewing also peppered the texture of the hard white plastic with sharp little pieces that were cutting the inside of her mouth and gums - there was blood all over the ends of the toy.  I had to take it away from her, because, while she likes the toy, she's also destroying her mouth with it.

review/summary: Good Design Could Use Some Improvements
review/text: These toys have been a staple in our house for years. If your dog loves to play with a ball as much as a good long two this is a little piece of doggie heaven.<br /><br />We have two Old English Bulldogs a 95 pound six year old, whose always had a Bouncy Bone and his partner in crime a seven month old puppy whose already over 50 pounds. They both adore these but as reviewers have mentioned the treats are gone in a blink of an eye.<br /><br />One of the concerns I've had with the treats themselves is that Rawhide is processed with so many chemicals - including formaldehyde. I make it a point to never buy rawhide.<br /><br /> The bone part of the toy is great for easy to moderate chewers but for hardcore, aggressive chewers it's not going to hold up well. Harley our oldest Bulldog reduced his new bone to mere shreds in a few days. The material is no where near as durable as Nylabone especially their Durachew which is about as close to indestructible as you can get.<br /><br />Like all Nylon based chew toys, once they get jagged it's time to throw them away. Nylon can splinter into shards and cause internal damage, but then so can bone and hard rubber. Which we discovered a few years ago when Harley had eaten part of a hard rubber toy and needed emergency surgery as it was blocking his intestines - a close and incredibly scary call.<br /><br />Cotton rope toys like the Booda Rope are really the safest and although they ingest quite a bit, it's non toxic and digests quickly. The other side of the coin is that most dogs lose interest in them pretty quickly, albeit for those games of Tug-O-War.<br /><br />At the end of the day, there's no perfect dog toy, and supervision is everything.<br /><br />The Busy Buddy Bouncy Bone packs a tremendous amount of "Fun Power" and our dogs love them. I wish they would hold up better and  replace the treat with a healthier alternative.

review/summary: Keeps my dog busy
review/text: There's nothing earth-shattering about this particular toy. It does what it is supposed to do, which is to keep my dog busy chewing out the rawhide pieces. She has it down to about twenty minutes. It does keep her busy, and when I go to refill it, she gets excited. The main problem is that it does become expensive to upkeep, since the little rawhide disks are like $8 a pack, and she goes through them pretty quickly. But the toy itself is tough, doesn't splinter, and stands up to her chewing (This is a 40 pound New Guinea Singing Dog mix). I'd recommend it, certainly.

review/summary: Great toy. They should sell replacement ends!
review/text: My 12lb min pin mix loved this from the moment I gave it to her. She was so excited about it the first time I gave it to her loaded with the treat disks, she worked on it for 2 hours and exhausted herself. She loves it weather it has the treats on it or not. I got her the 'medium' size. The small seemed too little. She's an avid chewer and tears up most toys really quickly. She's had this one for several weeks and it's still in ok shape. The ends are plastic material, similar to a Nylabone. She loves chewing them, even with no treats on it. They wear similar to a Nylabone Durachew as well. It would be really great if this company sold JUST the bone portion to replace the worn ones. The center ball is heavy rubber like a Kong is made from. It will be a great ball on its own once the ends are worn out. She loves her toy so much, if the cats walk past it, she runs over to grab her toy from them (as if they want it!). Despite this being on the pricey side and not lasting a super long time, she enjoys it so much I'm going to get her another soon. When she's acting really silly and jumping around, it's too great a pacifier to give up!

review/summary: Dog Loves It, For 5 Minutes
review/text: My energetic lab mix loves his Busy Buddy.  Sometimes he gnaws on just the bone part for a little while, but he is ecstatic when the rawhide rings are added. It occupies him for about 5-7 minutes.  Be wary of anything that says it entertains your dog for hours, because most likely it will entertain some dogs for just a couple minutes.  Probably the smaller the puppy, the longer it lasts.  But it's nothing for my T-Rex.

review/summary: Pretty Durable, Treats Get Expensive
review/text: I have a 10 month old Lab puppy, 50 pounds, and he is a big time chewer/shredder.  He's gotten to a point where he is only interested in a toy if it has a treat (Kong, IQ treat ball, etc) or can be shredded apart (stuffed animals, tennis balls, etc).  I was happy to see that this keeps him occupied for 20-30 minutes at a time and I only put one gnawhide treat on it at a time.  He usually chews the ends of the bones as well as tries to get the gnawhide off.  We have a Med/Lg size (seems to be the perfect size for him) and it takes him just a few minutes to get the actual gnawhide off when he is trying, the rest of the time is spent happily chewing on the ends.  My dog usually isn't interested in Nylabones so I was surprised to see him chewing on this so much.<br /><br />I will agree with a couple other reviews:<br />-  White nylon bone easily gets chewed up and gets quite sharp.  He hasn't had any cuts in his mouth that I've found, but I do have to be careful when unscrewing the ends because of how sharp it is.<br />-  It's quite heavy for a toy.  My dog loves to get playful and throw toys into the air with his mouth, but this one is a little too heavy for that, and so far he hasn't shows any interest in chewing on the ball in the center.<br /><br />One more downside for me is that the treats can get expensive.  So far they are at least $0.50 per gnawhide (they were about $0.80 each at Target) so if you were to use 2 treats at a time like it is meant for, that's at least a $1 a pop.  So I've resorted to using this as a special treat every couple of days instead of daily.<br /><br />Also, I asked a vet about the cornstarch ones and they said they highly DO NOT RECOMMEND CORNSTARCH for animals, that dogs can't digest them well, just as they say to avoid dog food that has corn.

review/summary: Trustworthy stand-by
review/text: I'm always looking for different chew toys to keep my Bull-Terrier and Bichon/Shi-Tzu mix occupied.  I've bought a lot of different ones, and though others are not left completely unplayed with (chewed) both dogs go back to the Busy Buddy bouncy bone.  Typically, it takes about 2 month for them to chew the bone ends down to a near nub.  I pull off the ball and save it for them to play with and throw away the core.  At this point we've gone through approximately 20 of these in three years with lots of other nylon bone type products thrown in.  In the end, at least one of these ALWAYS has to be in the toy basket. Its now a trustworthy standard. I know that I should probably keep 2 in there, but its fun to watch them steal it from each other. :-) Great product!

review/summary: Great Toy... Keeps your pet busy for a long time...
review/text: I recently adopted a Boston Terrier. I've always had large breed dogs, so I did a lot of research before selecting him. All the videos I saw and blogs I read said that Boston's really love to chew on stuff, so you should get him a lot of toys. After combing through Amazon and other pet store sites, I finally settled on this one and the Bristle Bone.  Unfortunately, the first one I bought was a medium and way too big for my little guy (the chances you take buying something online), but then I found a "small" one in a local pet store and it was perfect.  My little Bandit gets mileage out of this toy and it keeps him busy far longer than any of his other toys.  If you have a similar size pet or smaller, you really need the small as I think the medium will still be too big once he grows up.  There is quite a large difference in the sizes.  Note: The "Bristle Bone" small is about the same size as the "Bouncy Bone" medium.  I had to order an x-small in that one.  The small size refills fit both although they are not as small as the ones that come with it.  According to the Premier website, they don't come in x-small (which I think is a bit dumb, but whatever, the small works).  Hopefully, this was of help to you.

review/summary: Save your money and buy a kong and stuff it with goodies
review/text: If your dog likes to chew or is pretty hard on the toys this is not the toy you want to get.  Within 5 minutes my dog had the ends off this toy. Get a kong and stuff it with treats and peanut butter and freeze it.  Dogs loves it and its lasts hours

review/summary: My puppy loves this!
review/text: I have a 5 month old chihuahua-mix puppy who absolutely loves this.  She also likes the Kong, but this lasts MUCH longer for her if I put two gnawhides on. I'm able to distract her and calm her in most circumstances if I have this toy handy.  It's definitely her most "high-value" toy.

review/summary: designed for a very tiny dog
review/text: Just received this item & I was shocked at how tiny it was. The size should be described as mini. In fact, they should state the dimensions in the product description. The small size is 3 1/2" long & the "gnawhides" are 1/8" thick, 1" wide. Have a 14 week old Cairn (weighs 6 lbs.) that is a very active chewer & he'd probably try to swallow this thing whole. It would take him longer to chew his dog food than it would one of the rawhide rings. I know dog toys aren't cheap (if you're buying them all the time) but the price for this size bone ($7.73) is ridiculous to me. Especially when you add to that the cost of the refills. This toy would have been great for my Pom when she was a baby: she weighed 2 lbs. at 3 months. But for a "small" dog? Guess my idea of small is way different. Rated this item 2 stars only because it arrived quickly.

review/text: Our 3 dogs love this bone and when combined with the treats, it keeps them busy for quite awhile.  My mistake was not each dog their one but I will.<br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a puppy or dog that needs to be kept busy

review/summary: Doesn't last long
review/text: I bought this for my Miniature Pinscher and she really loved it.  She didn't lose interest in it but she ended up eating the bones on either side of the toy before finishing the treats. She only weighs 9 pounds so if anything this could be used for a Chihuahua. My dog never chews up any of her toys so this one wasn't very good.  We used it for about a week before throwing it away.

review/summary: Wonder Toy!
review/text: My dog LOVES this toy! She is a strong chewer and rips apart most toys. This toy is resiliant enough to withstand her chewing, but has the added benefit of the rawhide ring that she can rip apart. She will also play with it when there is no rawhide on it, she likes to bounce the ball part of it. This toy was a lifesaver, five paws up!

review/summary: Great fun for little dogs
review/text: My two Italian greyhounds recieved this toy for Christmas and it was the highlight of the day for them. Sharing was a problem (should have gotten 2!) but we worked out a scedule. I.G.'s are not terribly aggressive chewers so it took them the entire day to remove every trace of the chewy part. Even without the chewy parts, they still liked it.

review/summary: cut my Lab's gums
review/text: Got this for my ten month old Lab, and she loves it - like everyone else, she gets the "gnawhide" rings off pretty quickly, and then happily keeps chewing.<br /><br />Until I found blood on it.<br /><br />The bone part is made of nylon, like a Nylabone - only this one raises very sharp shards that cut my girl's mouth. She had it for maybe 30 - 60 minutes all told (which included some time fetching, so not all chewing). Really disappointing, because she was so proud of it. I may try and file the sharp pieces down and then keep a close eye on her, but I'm worried that if she loosens one of these shards and swallows it, it will do some damage internally.<br /><br />While she is a power chewer, I've never worried about her with Nylabones, for example - she has raised pieces on those as well (and swallowed them), but they are not so crazy sharp.<br /><br />One other fact that I found important is that this toy is made in China; I checked through this listing and didn't see that mentioned anywhere, but it is on the package and stamped on the product itself. I'm hesitant to give our girl any toys made there (especially anything consumable, like the "gnawhide"), because of the difference in production standards.

review/summary: The best for my pit bull!!
review/text: Brutus, my 3 year old pit bull, is such a heavy chewer he can destroy just about any toy in no time flat. The only toys that stand a chance with him are extreme Kongs, Nylabones, and the large size of the Premier Busy Buddy Bouncy Bone. (NOTE: There is a medium/large size, but it's 7"; the large size is 9", and that's preferable, IMO.) He loves chewing on the ends, he loves chewing on the big purple ball in the center, and he loves the gnawhide treats. And I love the fact that the toy lasts and lasts and lasts. Also, the fact that I can add in the gnawhide treats is a bonus because it seems to keep him more interested in the Bouncy Bone, compared to the Nylabones and/or Kongs.  With the Kongs, I can and do fill them with food and treats, and he'll play with them until the food is gone. But after that, he quickly loses interest. It's different with the Bouncy Bone; he'll keep on playing with it long after he finishes the gnawhide treats.<br /><br />Eventually, he was able to chew off one of the ends. But he now loves playing with the purple ball by itself, carrying it with him everywhere he goes. He likes it when I take it from his mouth and throw it in the house and/or backyard. He keeps bringing it back. And back. And....well, you get the picture. From now on, this is the only toy I'll ever get for him. He is a voracious eater, and is extremely motivated by food incentives. But he loves his Bouncy Bone even MORE than food, because instead of running straight to his food bowl in the morning, he runs right for his Bouncy Bone. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for heavy chewers!!!

review/summary: my dog's FAVORITE
review/text: My dog (a 30 pound wire hair fox terrier and corgi mix) absolutely LOVES this toy!!! I originally got it so that he could have something to do while I was gone and he was in his crate, and was very disappointed to find that he pulled the circular rawhides off in a matter of minutes...at first I thought, "well there goes 10 bucks down the drain!". But after that, it became his FAVORITE bone. He just loves throwing it around and chewing on the bone ends. It lasted about 6 months before he chewed both ends off (note: he is a very very intense chewer), and even after that, he still loves playing with the purple ball that came in the middle. I bought him a new bone for christmas and again, he can't get enough of it. My roommates dog has the same feelings for these bones, and we have affectionately started calling them their "crack" bones because we don't know why they are completely obsessed with them! I would highly highly recommend!!!

review/summary: Not A Surprise...
review/text: My lab was SO excited to get a new toy....as many have said, he ate the treats on the ends in a matter of minutes. I must preface and say I LOVE nylabones, but these bone ends are not as durable and he has already begun to destroy both ends. This can't be a toy we leave with him without intensely watching.<br /><br />But, on a positive note: HE LOVES IT! It has provided plenty of fun!!<br /><br />For your purchasing decision it may help to know our lab is 70 lbs and we bought the Med/Lg and it seems like perfect fit.

review/text: This is a fun chew toy and my terriers enjoy the product. My only reason for not giving it a full five stars is that it is not widely distributed which makes it hard to find the replacement chew rings or to replace the toy when the ends get chewed down.

review/summary: My dog loves!
review/text: I bought this on a whim at CVS trying to keep our 5 month old German Shorthair busy from chewing everything he could.  He HOWLS when we give it to him.  When I put a new chew on one of the ends he carries it around for about 20 minutes howling until he settles and chews it.  It is hysterical - he doesn't react to anything else like that.  I don't know if he thinks it's too good to be true, that he's actually allowed to have something so good.  It will keep him busy for about 40 minutes.  The best chew toy ever - he's barely made a dent in the ball.

review/summary: Perfect Toy for an Agressive Chewer
review/text: This Bouncy Bone is a wonderful distraction from boredom for my one year old Akita mix dog.  He chews on the "bone" part as he trys to get to the rawhide discs.  Eventually he will work hard enough to get the discs worn down and off.  I keep this toy for times we can't walk or exercise him or when I have to be on the computer for a couple of hours.  He's choosey and isn't interested in the toy if the rawhide dics aren't attached.

review/summary: Fun Fades Quickly
review/text: Our 4 pound dachshund loved this toy at first, but as soon as the smell wears off the chews then she wants nothing to do with it.  However it does seem well built, and is easy to use. Mostly just to expensive to keep loaded with chews if your dog only likes new smells or eats them quickly.
