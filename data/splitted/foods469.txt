review/summary: Excellent dog food!!!
review/text: I adopted an English Bull Terrier/Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross and he used to be lethargic and he would only eat dry food when it was mixed with wet food. I switched him to Taste of the Wild and he ate the whole bowl very quickly an without any wet food mixed in. Since making the switch, his coat looks better, he has more energy and he just seems to be fitter. Highly recommend for energetic breeds.

review/summary: PET FOOD RECALL
review/text: Please be aware that this is involved in a recall of pet food manufactured by Diamond. I just ordered this and got a bag that has a production number that is involved in the recall. I have bought TotW for years and it has helped my allergy-prone big dog so much, but I was concerned when Diamond bought them out. Unfortunately, this only reinforces my concern.<br /><br />Go to [...]

review/summary: Great but it puts on the el bees.
review/text: We have a 23lb Parsons Russell Terrier and a 42lb mixed Lab/Collie.<br />- Their coats and teeth look great.<br />- Bowel movements are solid<br />- No yacking up at random times and spots. The mixed Lab/Collie has a sensitive stomach but no problems since switching from Nutro sensitive.<br /><br />We went from having a backyard and a Nutro diet to no backyard and the TOTW diet. My mistake was not recognizing the significantly altered variables sooner. So our little Russell Terrier could barely scratch his butt so I've had to reduce his intake and run him more.<br /><br />The two dogs share a bowl, so I've closely monitored them and it seems to be paying off. However, I've decided to switch to the Salmon version of TOTW because of their new caloric requirements. Just be careful, its rich.

review/summary: Puggle finally has firm stool
review/text: Puppy was ready to transition off of her puppy food and I knew I wanted a grain free product. After much internet research and talking to other dog parents, I chose TOTW.<br /><br />PRO:<br />She likes the taste of the food. My dog doesn't eat right away always, but she seems more enthusiastic about this than her puppy food.<br />Firm stools!! I had tried four different puppy formulas and her last was better but finally her stools are consistently firm.<br />Softer and shinier coat.<br />High quality food means your dog needs less food, making the bag last.<br /><br />CON:<br />The smell is overpowering, but I keep her food in an airtight container, so it's not too bad. It isn't so overpowering that having her food sit out is offensive.<br />I'm a huge fan of Amazon, but the shipping of this product was poor. The box was practically falling open and the delivery man left the box in a puddle on the floor of our building entry instead of in front of my door (as they normally do).<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />I will continue to purchase this food for my dog. After the second bag, I will switch her to one of the other TOTW flavors since that is what was recommended for her.

review/summary: The best food ever!
review/text: When I got my Goldendoodle from the breeder, he was eating Iams dog food so we kept him on it.  He got very sick with a yeast infection in his ears and on his skin.  I started cooking organic food for him but he didn't get any better and developed a UTI by the time he was three months old.  He was super skinny and his hair was falling out and thinning.  After taking him to the vet for treatment, I decided to put him on TOTW.  He loved it from the start.  He is now six months old and the size of a small horse, which is what a standard Goldendoodle should be!  He has a beautiful coat and no longer has stinky ears.  We can't take him out in public without people stopping us to pet him or ask about him.  The difference that TOTW made in a matter of two weeks is unbelievable.  I wouldn't feed him anything else now.  It is worth every penny.  He loves the Salmon and Bison/Venison flavors.  He doesn't care for the other flavors.

review/summary: My dogs love this food!
review/text: This food is great. I have two dogs, a golden retriever and a Shih Tzu Brussels Griffon mix and they both love it. My Brussels was a 1 year old rescue dog and he wouldn't eat the Iams dog food we had so I researched food and found this one. I decided to give it a try. My golden went blind less then a year ago and gained a lot of weight(it's one of the side effects of his disease SARDS) so I wanted to see if this would help at all.... Well guess what! My golden has lost weight and his coat looks healthier after 1 month 1/2 of eating the food and my Brussels loves it too. I highly recommend this food! On a side note we watched my in-laws 14 year old dog and she hardly eats her wet pedigree dog food. She pushes it around a lot, so I gave her a few pieces of the taste of the wild to see what she would do and guess what she ate it all then barked at me for more!

review/summary: Really good dog food
review/text: I have a 3-year-old boxer dog who's extremely sensitive when comes to food and anything related due to a surgery done in the stomach when she was a puppy... for a couple of years we tried every dry or canned food available and nothing seems to pleased her. For long time we prepared homemade food specially for dogs but the time spent was not worthy and she got tired of the combinations from time to time.<br /><br />After an illness in her skin due to nutrition issues, we began looking for other options even if it wasn't available in the  local market. Searching the web we found this dog food, rated as one of the tops for several specialized websites and blogs, one of the more affordable of the listed top brands and after reviewing Amazon's comments, we decided to try.<br /><br />My dog looooves this food, she's being doing great since, more energy, a healthy looking and it helped heal her disease. Thanks god that a local supermarket began to bring this brand because since I live outside US, shipping made it a lot more expensive, but totally worthy.<br /><br />I truly recommend this dog food.. Fiona loves it and we've been feeding her with this for about six month and still not bored of it. Right now, shes eating her food like the first time and leave a clean plate every time... not even in the floor I found a single piece.<br /><br />This supplier is extremely quick so you won't have any delayed issues... this was specially important for me since I live outside US.<br /><br />Hope this review is useful since we found a treasure in this brand.

review/text: This is the best dog food you could ever feed your dog.  I have a 12 year old German Shorthair Pointer and she's been eating Tast of the Wild for about a year now, and her coat is beautiful, shiny healthy,  she acts like a 2 year old, full of energy and spunk. She also does not have that bad dog odor. She actually smells good. I owe this all to this wonderful dog food. I fed her the expensive top of the line food  before and she didn't do well on it at all.<br />Spend the money on this food it's amazing.

review/summary: Great food for large, active dogs
review/text: After doing a lot of research, I think we can settle on this food for a while. I was previously feeding my dog Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul but my dog did not really care for the taste. I decided to try Taste of the Wild and he absolutely loves it. I have a 65 lb. Catahoula-mix who has a lot of energy and gets plenty of exercise -- therefore, I feel comfortable feeding him such a high-fat food. If I had a less active dog or an older dog, I would be reconsider whether this is really the right food. I've read many reviews online of this food which advise feeding slightly under the recommended amount because this is a pretty calorie-pacted kibble but you'll have to adjust the amounts to meet your dog's needs.<br /><br />My dog runs to his food bowl now and eats every last kibble bit. I can't honestly say that it's made a difference in his coat yet, but he's only gone through one bag (which lasts us about 2.5 months).<br /><br />Since I ordered my last bag, the price of this food has gone up about $6.00. I hope the price increases don't continue, needless to say.

review/summary: Good for our German Shepherd
review/text: I am still skeptical of all these high end dog foods... I know dogs who lived on the cheap grocery store stuff and lived long fulfilling lives. Regardless, this is the food that our breeder uses. After doing my own extensive research, I decided to use it.<br /><br />Our German Shepherd puppy likes this. Her #2 is good and firm most of the time. Her parents are fed a raw diet, and she was on a partial raw diet. However, 2 weeks before coming home to us, the breeder put her 100% on the kibble knowing that we won't be doing raw food. Our puppy has been with us for a month now, and we and her have no complaints about the food.<br /><br />We feed her about 2.5-2.75 cups. When we got her she was 20lbs, now she is 30lbs.

review/summary: Perfect Dog Food
review/text: My German Shepherd is now on her third bag of ToTW food. She has tried the Wetlands and High Prairie formulas and seems to love both.  The food has high-quality ingredients that are appropriate for a dog's diet.  It's ideal for dogs with allergies and works for dogs of all ages.<br /><br />I would recommend switching foods very slowly because of the potential for diarrhea.  Otherwise, this food is just right for my dog and gives her a shiny coat and lots of energy.  I like that the food is grain-free. Because it has a high nutritional value, dogs can eat less of it per day compared to other foods.  My dog (75 pounds) eats 4 cups a day.<br /><br />TOTW is definitely worth a try if you want your dog to eat healthy!

review/summary: So far, so good - the furkids are intrigued by the new food
review/text: I have a pack of German Shepherd Dogs from European bloodlines - three generations live in our household. Two of our dogs are quickly becoming seniors (in a few months they will both be in double digit years) and our only female is highly allergic to something - at odd intervals she will lose all the fur on her back, or all her fur on her belly, or all her fur on her legs.  She isn't normally a picky eater as she has a high food drive but this last round of furlessness has really knocked her for a loop. We had been feeding various Diamond formulas, something has happened as recently they have had serious gas attacks - worse than a sewer pit. It has become intolerable indoors :-(<br /><br />I've been eying Taste of the Wild - Bison formula for years, but the price of the bags has kept me at bay. Having fed Solid Gold in the past I am aware of the fact grainfree foods without fillers means feeding less food per day which equates to helping to normalize the price and hence means less land mine materials to dispose of... but it's still hard to shake the price at first, especially in this economy.  When feeding Diamond we typically also add a powder multi-vitamin mineral formula as well as omega 3 oils and I give them glucosamine and chonditrin, all of which appears to be in Taste of the Wild - Bison formula which means it will also help to normalize the price a bit and save us time.<br /><br />I am very impressed with the list of ingredients and the lack of cereal / grain fillers.  The bag lists 5 strains of probiotics as well as raspberries, blueberries, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, yucca - for less smelly stools!, a plethora of vitamins and minerals as well as essential fatty acids including omega 3s.<br /><br />This evening I brought home 30 pound bags of each the Bison and the Salmon formulas.  The senior dogs quickly turned a keen interest to the new bags - they largely ignore the Diamond bags.  I gave them each 1 cup this evening - at first they were hesitant but I added a few bites from our dinner to entice them to their food bowls - they quickly discovered the new food tastes great!  I purchased TOTW locally at a farmer's supply where I also paid sales tax.  Currently the dog food is less expensive here on Amazon AND without sales tax, to boot. I also like the fact I can order the food online - my husband won't have to go pick up the food when I am out of town.  If the dogs do well to this formula it really will be a win-win-win-win situation as it will likely save some expensive veterinary bills as it improves the health of our dogs. There's no way to put a price on good health!<br /><br />UPDATE: In just a few short days the gas attacks have ceased, the dogs are begging for TOTW over Diamond and we have noticed a reduction in doggie smell.  Even my frugal husband has agreed these are all worthwhile benefits to justify the increased cost.<br /><br />In our ideal world, our dogs coats and health seem to be the best when we combine TOTW with the vitamin and mineral supplement <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A6XJGG">Farnam Super 14 6.5LB</a> along with the Omega 3 supplement <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q9KPRG">AniMed CoMega Supreme 128 oz</a>. I also add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AMUWLK">Liqumins ConcenTrace Trace Mineral Drops, Low Sodium, 8-Ounce Bottle</a> to their drinking water.  The foul doggie odor is minimalized; shedding is a minimum; bowel movements are regular - not too firm, not too soft; and their coats, their teeth, their eyes.. all aspects indicate happy healthy dogs :-)

review/summary: Helped dogs with allergies, diarrhea, and weight gain.
review/text: I'm really pleased with the Taste of the Wild - Hi Prairie Canine Formula.  I have 2 dogs, one is a boxer/pit mix with bad skin allergies, I've tried MANY different dog foods with her (even really expensive, high end foods and 'prescription' foods) - this is one of the few foods I've found so far that helps. My other dog is a pit bull and 90% of the foods out here give him diarrhea, this food doesn't upset his stomach (however the 'wetlands canine' formula DID upset his stomach).  I suggested this food to a friend with an English mastiff with allergies and that doesn't seem to keep on enough weight and this food has really helped him gain weight and helps his skin from getting irritated.<br /><br />I highly recommend this food.  It's not full of 'fillers' and I've had really good results with it.

review/text: My dog is half chihuahua and thus, a picky eater. We've tried Orijen, Acana, Blue Buffalo Wilderness and many other "natural" dog foods but she was never excited about eating. Taste of the Wild appealed to me because of the lower price compared to other brands. With the High Prairie Formula Artoo comes running whenever we say "Dinner" or "Breakfast". We've also tried the Pacific Stream and Wetlands formulas but she isn't a fan of those. She also only poops 2-3 times a day with solid poops with this dog food.

review/summary: Great all around nutrition
review/text: I have an English Mastiff and an English Bulldog, both breeds are known for their sensitive digestive systems.  From a puppy our mastiff has been very food sensitive and our bulldog has gas issues (big suprise I know)  anyhow both of the dogs love this food.  Not only does it show in their eating habits and weight but also in the amount of waste as well as their coats.  They look just amazing.  They have been eating the Taste of the Wild brand for about 6 months now and we are sold on it.  The pricing is very good, especially if you have amazon prime.  I pay less than I would in the store and have those large bags just waiting at the door for me, instead of having to lug them into my bug, and believe me with two dogs, one being a large breed you cant beat that convenience!  I urge you to take a look at their nutritional facts, I think you will be happily suprised.

review/text: I tried Taste of the wild for the first time and my 9 year old female lab loves it. It may seem a bit pricy, but it last longer because your dog need less of it to get better nutrition. She has more energy and a bright healthy looking coat. I am extremely happy with this product.

review/text: I have ordered Taste of the Wild through Amazon before, but this time I received food that was rotten.  My dog loves this brand of food and it has proved to be healthy for her, but even she would lift up her nose when she smelled this food.  It was all I could take without gagging to scoop it out of the bag.  I ended up driving an hour the next day to pick her up some fresh food at a tractor supply store.  I am sure that this was a rare occasion, but beware when buying this food online.

review/summary: Second Bag - Garbage
review/text: I'd tried Taste of the Wild Bison & Venison about a month back for my first time. The first bag was great, the dogs loved it and everything went well. I ordered a second bag about a month later. I have a red heeler puppy about 11wks, and a 1 year old jrt/blue heeler on it. When i opened the bag, it had a very strong smell, much stronger than the first bag, i hadn't thought much of it until after the dogs ate. The 12wk puppy got sick after eating his first bowl of the second bag, he was whimpering a lot, and just couldn't keep anything down, and my 1yr has been having serious gas and diarrhea. Now they both will not touch the stuff. I picked up a bag of some other stuff at the local petsmart, and they are both eating fine.<br /><br />So, i'm not sure if there are some quality control issues or i just got a bad bag, but i'll be trying something else.

review/summary: By far the BEST food available.
review/text: I've tried 'em all.  My yellow lab, Buster, would invariably suffer from loose stool or diarrhea from all of the grain and other crap they put in most dog foods.  Within a week of starting on TOTW, his stool firmed up, he got by on less food and has been a happier dog since.  He has three nice bowel movements a day, like clockwork, and they extrude out in firm, tootsie roll-like sections.  His stool also doesn't smell nearly as vile as it previously did.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say that this product delivers exactly what the manufacturer claims: superior nutrition from superior ingredients.

review/summary: Dog Loves the Food, and so does my Wife
review/text: I am going to be serious with you.  My wife loves our German Shepherd more than me.  I thought that Purina 1 was a good brand until we got our "Sheriff".  He eats over 5 cups of food a day.  Here is what I have been told by my better half: the number one ingredient is Bison and venison, NOT CORN.  That is the problem with the mass merchants who think dogs can eat different types of flavored corn.  Why do you think that there crap is so crazy when they change from Purina to Iams?  Becuase it is all CRAP.  She is really psycho when it come to our dog.  She thinks he is better than I, and she will only buy "Taste of" for him.  Other flavors he likes are the "water foul" and "hi Sierra".  If you love your dog better than you love you husband, buy this dog food.  Our dog is 22 months old, never had bad dog food, over 100 pounds, great teeth, and we have had nothing but great comments from the vet!  We (she) will only buy "Taste Of" PERIOD, and I will too!

review/summary: Great for Dog with Sensitive Stomach
review/text: Our German Shepherd puppy was having issues eating food with gluten in it. We had looked up good grain-free dog foods that were suitable for puppies and found Taste of the Wild. As soon as we put it in his bowl, he gobbled it down, which he never did on his other foods. So, the taste of the bison and venison is clearly appealing. His stomach problems have improved 100% after being on this food. I'd recommend it to anyone!

review/summary: Something to BARK about!
review/text: My dog is a 39-42 lbs border collie. He is a relaxed dog, who is not hyper active.<br /><br />I've always tried to give my dog the best food since he was a puppy (I sometimes think he eat better than I do). his breeder used to feed her dogs Diamond, so he came to me with Diamond puppy food. At the time I didn't know of anyone in Austin who carried it so I switched to Nutro Max  what my sister fed their Aussie pup and liked) He did great on that but I wanted better, so then I went to Nutro Ultra. After reading about it I decided it might not be the best for him and sampled a lot of other "healthy", grain-free dog foods.<br /><br />TOLW was his favorite. He has been on this brand for a year now. He has more energy, a nice coat, firm, small, stool that is super easy to pick up. I also like that it lasts a while. Because it isn't filled with bad fillers, you don't have to feed as much of it. A 30lb bag lasts me a little over a month and a half.<br /><br />Like with any new food changes, please switch over slowly.

review/summary: Love similac Organic!
review/text: Breastmilk has sugar in it, it is why a lot of breastfed babies will refuse formula supplementing. Similic is a godsend for me as I can never feed exclusive breastmilk, I must supplement at least 2 oz. formula after each breastfeeding, even with pumping. We only drink organic milk b/c my husband is allergic to the pesticide they put in the feed of the cows and breaks out in a horrible rash when he drinks nonorganic milk, so for our baby we would not use any formula besides organic. That being said my son would not drink Earth's Best as it is not sweet like my milk is sweet, when we found Similac organic it was such a blessing as he finally would drink it no problem. Similac has put a lot of effort into helping Moms who cannot breastfeed, they listened and developed a product that tastes most like Moms milk. My son is 3 now and has no cavities at all.<br />We will use nothing else for baby girl coming soon and I came here to make sure I had some ordered this time before hand, I love the convenience of having formula, diapers and wipes delivered right to the door each month!

review/summary: Read this article first
review/text: I thought I was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought Similac was a brand I could trust to be good for baby. That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...] Needless to say I'm switching to another brand.<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity.

review/summary: Spend a bit more for a healthier organic!
review/text: We have now gone through 4 formulas, and here are our conclusions.<br /><br />Similac (non-organic): They use cows which have been given growth hormones.  Seriously, even most non-organic milks in grocery stores do not use growth hormones.  Our baby spent his first four months off the growth-charts until it finally dawned on me to check into this.<br /><br />Similac Organic: Our baby liked this one, but then a NYT article revealed that this formula has a significant amount of cane sugar added - no wonder he liked it.  I disagree with other reviewers' comments that "breast milk normally contains sugar".  Breast milk contains the sugar LACTOSE, not cane sugar.  Lactose is a natural sugar and should be the basis of any baby formula.<br /><br />Earth's Best: We really struggled with the transition from Similac to Earth's Best.  We went through a 2 week transition of 3/4 Similac, 1/4 Earth's Best...with a slow increase in the Earth's Best.  Even to our adult taste senses, it had a fishy odor and taste (likely the DHA, which is supposedly taken from seaweed for this brand).  And it NEVER WENT INTO SOLUTION.  We would constantly have to interrupt his feeds to check and see whether the nipple was clogged - being a baby, he would suck and suck -- even when no milk was coming out.  Our baby developed eczema - I am not convinced the formula caused the problem.  Babies get eczema.  But after trying everything else (detergents, lotions, soaps, etc) and reading some reviews questioning whether Earth's Best caused eczema, we decided to try one more formula switch.<br /><br />Baby's Only Organic: "Now here is something I can add to my coffee when we run out of milk," says my husband.  It has a wonderful smell of oatmeal.  No transition needed, our baby finished an entire 8oz in one sitting.  It goes into solution better than both the Similac and the Earth's Best.  No GI distress or constipation when we made the switch.  I agree with other reviewers that it is annoying that the canisters are small, but scoop for scoop, it is less expensive than Earth's Best.  Just waiting for Amazon to have a "subscription" discount.  I highly recommend Baby's Only!

review/text: I wanted an organic formula for my 5 week old daughter since breasfeeding didn't work out for us. After she was on this formula for about a week, she became severely constipated and gassy. I searched the internet and found that many other people had this same problem with this formula. We switched her to the non-organic Similac Advance and the constipation cleared up almost immediately. I would love to use an organic formula that did not cause digestive issues.

review/text: My baby had bad reflux and spit-up and we tried multiple formulas including those specifically made for spit up.  The Similac Organic is the first one that he has shown very little to no spit up after eating.  Great for him, bad for me because it is a bit pricier.  Not sure what is different about it that it affects his spit up differently but happy it works.  I did run out and used some packets we had on hand of another formula and the spit up immediately returned.  I knocked down one star because I really don't understand why the label "organic" has to mean much more money.  Health should be affordable and accessible.

review/summary: Love this formula!
review/text: I wanted to solely breastfeed but was unable to keep up and had to supplement formula.  I chose Similac because they are a very reputable company and I had a ton of it from the hospital.  We have used both the powder and ready made and he likes both.  He got a little constipated at the beginning but has been on it now for 5 months and no problems.  I read some other reviews about sucrose...well, sucrose is just sugar and ALL formula has sugar in it.  Other companies just label it differently and since ths one is organic it has to contain a pure sugar.  As far as the hexane goes, I did my research, ALL formulas except one (Babys Only) use the hexane method.  Babys Only contains brown rice syrup that has been shown to have high levels of arsenic..uh, no thanks.  Also Similac has been tested and found to have no hexane present in the product.  Overall my baby is healthy and smart so I am very happy with this formula.

review/summary: BEST FORMULA for our baby girl.
review/text: Our baby girl is 8 months now. I breastfed for 4 months, then she was on Baby's Only for 2 months, till I found out the brown rice syrup they use as a sweetener contains arsenic, according to a study by Dartmouth University. Here is a link: [....]<br />So after I researched that issue, I decided trace amounts, if any, of hexane to extract omega 3/DHA is still a much better option than arsenic, which is a very destructive poison. Our baby has done great on Similac organic. I"m even taking it to Europe where we will be for 5 weeks this summer. She will be on this formula till she is at least 18 months, since I think it has a lot more nutritional value than cow's milk alone.<br />Hope you found this review helpful. Good luck in your search to find the best formula for your baby! :)

review/text: Baby liked the flavor of this just fine, and seemed to really gulp it down and eat a little more of it than the regular formula she usually drinks. (Maybe due to the added sugar in it? - Which I didn't know about when I purchased it.)<br /><br />This did cause minor constipation though, and that was alternating between this, and the regular formula. So I'm wondering if I had been feeding her only this, if the constipation would've been major? It's really disappointing, but the formula we are using now works great for us, so that's what matters most.

review/summary: This is not quality organic
review/text: I used Similac with my first two children (one full time formula, second as a supplement). I intended on using this organic formulation with my third, until I did more research. Similac chooses to use cheaper quality ingredients i.e cane sugar instead of lactose in this formula. It's the "cheap" way of making infant milk, although the product isn't cheap. Babies love it because it's loaded with extra, actual sugar instead of milk lactose similar to what is in breastmilk. Sadly, this formula is one of those scams by companies trying to get a piece of the green hype. Check out other brands instead. Earth's Best offers a better organic option for your child.

review/text: After chewing one piece of Spry peppermint gum you may notice your teeth and gums feeling more healthy. Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar as an ingredient, this item caught my attention.<br /><br />Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />It can be commercially manufactured from "xylan hemicellulose" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. Some Xylitol products are also made from corn.<br /><br />This product is made with a Xylitol, gum base, natural flavors, glycerin, gum Arabic, soy lecithin and beesewax.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br /><br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />What more could we ask for from a gum? This gum is a natural defense system and you will start to notice the results. Unlike other sugary gums, this will reduce cavities and it is just as flavorful, if not more so than most gums.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Nope, it really was stale--disappointing.  Because it's whole wheat, it can go bad quicker than other similar products.  I hope this is offered again when they find a way to refirgerate/freeze it before it ships so that it doesn't get stale.  Also, the manufacturer probably needs to add an expiration date to the packaging so that warehouses know when to get rid of it.

I purchased this and made it the exact way I have always made it.<br />But as soon as I opened up the container, I noticed a really funny smell.  Almost like stale crackers.  I assumed it was because I wasn't used to the Whole Wheat kind, so I went ahead and cooked it.<br />It still had this odd taste and smell.  I don't believe it was because it was Whole Wheat because we only eat Whole Wheat pasta, bread and brown rice.<br />My husband thought it was "OK" and was willing to eat more, but I thought it was inedible and returned it.  I'm so bummed out because I really wanted to like it.  If it was a stale batch, its too bad because its too expensive to risk buying another container.<br />The only product I've ever bought from Amazon that I've beeen really disappointed with.  Maybe because my expectations were so high?

review/summary: Kids love it...tastes like WHOLE WHEAT pasta
review/text: Some  of the other reviews I recalled reading said it didnt taste right or tasted stale....My kids loved it and Iwas happy to find  a whole wheat alternative to pearl cous cous which my kids  4,4,7) all adore. I was worried due to the reviews, but it tastes fine. Try any other  whole wheat pastas and they frankly, don't taste the same and you shouldnt expect this too either. Once you adjust your palette  and your family's) they will happily eat enjoy it!  Big hit in my housedold. I worried taht they woudl wonder why it was brown and be a little skeptical, but all three scarfed it up! Enjoy.

review/summary: As Stale As This Review
review/text: I should have heeded the other reviewers who noted that this product was stale on arrival. Same thing happened to me. Amazon was quick to remedy the problem, as it always is.<br /><br />But, stay away from this product. The package had no expiration date so there is no telling how old it is. And whole wheat products tend to go stale more quickly.

review/text: Don't buy this product.  I read the reviews that said the product was stale and they all appeared to be old reviews. The problem appeared to be fixed in the most recent reviews and I didn't believe they could sell a bad product for an extended period on Amazon and get away with it. I was wrong.  The couscous tastes rancid - if it's not stale it certainly is not appetizing.

review/summary: simple. convenient. delicious.
review/text: I've been drinking soy milk for many years and have tried a lot of different brands; Silk is the brand I buy most often. I like to choose organic wherever I can so this flavor gets points from me there. It's a good consistency, similar to whole milk if you've had that before to compare. As far as taste, it is creamy tasting yet very plain/neutral which is good on a number of levels: I can sweeten to taste - for instance with coffee or tea I prefer to use a little agave. In recipes that are savory calling for milk I don't have to worry about altering the flavor towards sweet.<br /><br />These aseptic packages are handy to keep in the pantry so you never run out; they can keep for months at a time. To me, this tastes almost identical to the refrigerated version.<br /><br />I can often find this locally for less so it's a good idea to compare prices.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and recommended.

review/summary: Oh so tasty, but some un-healthy ingredients
review/text: After a large price increase of the WestSoy unsweetened soymilk we started using the Organic Unsweetened Silk Soymilk, which we liked. Yet, today I was comparing the Silk to a soymilk I picked up in an Asian market, and saw that the Silk contains carrageenan, which is a thickener made from red seaweed. I also get a health newsletter that is one of the best from a Russell L. Blaylock, M.D., called "The Blaylock Wellness Report" [...]. One of his issues is on the dangers of inflammation. One of the food ingredients that is one of the worst cause of inflammation is carrageenan. Here's what he says about carrageenan:<br /><br />"To emphasize the importance of inflammation in cancer growth and spread, a number of studies have shown that carrageenan -- a common food additive made from seaweed and found in products as varied as ice cream, beer, and toothpaste -- can induce intense inflammation when injected into animal tissues."<br /><br />"In fact, it is used in studies of inflammation. Even diluted solutions of carrageenan injected close to an existing tumor cause the cancer to begin to grow very rapidly. It spreads to other tissues much faster than it would have without the carrageenan."<br /><br />"Another often-forgotten factor is the high amounts of excitotoxin food additives in the typical Western diet. This includes MSG (monosodium glutamate), hydrolyzed proteins, aspartame, soy protein concentrate and isolate, casienate, autolyzed yeast, yeast extract, natural flavoring, broth, stock and carrageenan -- all disguised names for high glutamate food additives, and all of them are allowed by the government."<br /><br />I called the company that makes Silk Soy, and they claim that because their carrageenan is food grade and approved by the FDA, it is therefore safe. Food grade or not, if carrageenan is bad for you, then it is bad for you whether food grade or not. I say, why take a chance?<br /><br />In addition, they add salt as an ingredient. Why? Salt isn't needed in this soy. Or at least produce a version that doesn't have the salt, or for that matter the carrageenan as well. I'll be going back to the Westsoy unsweetened organic.

review/text: I bought these ostensibly for my husband, but after a particularly bad day I decided to tear into one. I bought four packets in different flavors: cherry, caramel, chocolate-mint and original. Don't worry, I will replace the ones that go into my husband's birthday gift but I couldn't resist.<br /><br />I used them in an interesting application, which is to make 'frozen hot chocolate'. I took a packet of the original and blended it with ice and milk (actually I used So Delicious Coconut Milk Beverage because I eschew dairy). I like that it doesn't have powdered milk solids or anything else. It's a very pure mix that isn't muddled up by a ton of sugar or extra fanfare.<br /><br />Great sipping chocolate! Exceeded my expectations. I tried three of the flavors. I am going to get more to replace the ones I pilfered...

review/summary: Yummy stuff
review/text: I had mine first (a gift from someone) in 6 oz. milk. It was extremely rich and thick and fulfilling. Any lover of dark chocolate would adore this stuff. Part of the overall experience is the struggle to actually just sip it. After the first taste, the instinct is to gobble it up. Take it slow. Make it last. Every small sip is a flavor explosion, like a crumb of Maytag Blue Cheese.

review/summary: Too bitter for dark chocolate lover
review/text: I enjoy full-bodied chocolate so I thought I'd enjoy Bellagio's flavor. But it ended up being too strong, even with plenty of milk and sugar.

review/summary: Intensely Satisfying...even for a Chocolate Snob
review/text: I am so impressed with this sipping chocolate. I thought it would be too sweet, judging from the sugar content listed in the nutrition facts, but it's just right. This tastes like sipping a melted bar of 80% dark chocolate, it's so rich and creamy. I drink one packet a day as a treat to myself and it's more than enough to keep me satisfied without sneaking other sweets. I will re-order when I run out!

review/summary: A delicious treat
review/text: These individual packets make a small cup of hot milk a wonderful treat.  The deep, dark chocolate flavor makes you feel like you are enjoying a stay at an expensive bed and breakfast. I recommend using whole milk to give rich mouth feel, although any way you make it will be good.

review/summary: not really a sipping chocolate
review/text: That is a cocoa powder of a really great quality, I'd say the best hot chocolate, but not a sipping chocolate. I love drinking chocolate. So may be it is just me being wrong by assuming that sipping chocolate means drinking chocolate.

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: I have a lab puppy who believes there's nothing better in life than to make her dog food vanish in record time before throwing it up.  This has inspired my older yellow lab to follow suit as if they are training for the pie eating contest at next year's county fair.  After spending too much of my time trying to decide on which dog food bowl is best between the plastic apparati with stalagmites growing out of the bottom, I came across this good looking and reasonably priced stainless bowl, which according to pet experts avoids some problems associated with bacteria and plastic.  Plus, I was afraid of the other bowls due to some of the durability issues a few posters had mentioned.  So, I opted for this meathod, seeing it was close to what I have been doing, which is inserting a bowl upside down in their bowls, forcing my dogs to eat from the edges, which does slow them down a little bit.<br /><br />The first meal with these bowls went rather well.  It took them a few moments to get used to the central buldge, and did force them to move around, where I actually did hear some chewing (which was a first in a few months).  The next few meals seemed to get faster and faster, to where it may slow them down some, but after hearing the pupply belching and looking around for more food with her new and improved speed eating technique, I'm not terribly convinced I made the correct investment.  I've gone back to placing a smaller bowl upside down, which still provides the greatest slowdown meathod.  And yes, I've tried one and two tennis balls, small and big bowls and aside from giving them one morsel at a time, I'll stick with the upside down bowl, or I may try a muffin sheet a few clever posters have suggested.<br /><br />This bowl is not a total loss, and for dog owners with breeds sporting a flatter mug and even for some cats, this might work.  I may have to try my luck on one of the better made plastic Tom Sawyer Cave looking jobs, but for now, the bowl inside a bowl works best for me, and the durapet bowl will be used to help them slow their water gulping a little.

review/summary: a total waste of money
review/text: I absolutely feel like I got ripped off with this product. It only took my shiba about one minute to figure out how to go around the stupid bump and gobble down her food. So, it does not faze her one bit when it comes to eating. I'm kind of tired just watching her go all around the bowl. Plus like many other reviewers I find that's it's starting to come apart at the seam. I won't be contacting the company though because I don't want a replacement.

review/text: i am a big fan of these ... you can find them cheap and as long as you eat them within 3 or 4 days they are moist and chewy.  normally i buy my bagels from a bagel store but if you're short on funds or want yummy snacks aorund the house to feed your friends these are a good call.  also good with cream cheese of course.

review/summary: Great taste and texture
review/text: I like to review books and an occasional dvd -----I have never reviewed a food product.  But.............after tasting an "Everything Bagel" a few days ago, I am compelled to rave about it somewhere.  It was REALLY great  --  ate half with cream cheese and half with butter.  The taste is a wonderful and delicious mix of very chewable seeds along with a crispy outer and soft inner roll.<br /><br />This was a fortunate find because sometimes breakfast can be a little boring with just toast or a muffin.  These bagels are so good, I find myself thinking about them occasionally during odd hours.  Yes, they are that good.
