review/summary: top notch super-food for dogs
review/text: Purchased this from amazon fresh and my dog went crazy for it.  She will eat anything so that is not why this food is worth five stars to me.  What makes it superior is the way it changed my Chihuahuas behavior.  I have always fed her expensive foods and even trained her to eat vegatables, but after 2 weeks on this food her general energy level was higher, she was more active and happier.  Her coat became even glossier and she goes nuts when its feeding time.  The food does have a slight salmon smell which I would expect since its made of salmon.  My neighbors dog loved it for a week then became picky about it, but she free feeds and he is not a big eater or very active so, i believe his pickiness is just because he is not hungry.  He regularly refuses to eat everything.

review/text: I have truly enjoyed this tea.  I drink it most every day and it helps me to relax.  It is not meant to be a weight loss tea, but since I have started I have noticed great changes in my body weight and inches.  It has a great chocolate taste and with that taste helps me not to go for foods that are chocolate and not good for me.<br />I will definetely order this product again.  It give me lots of energy too.<br />I do wish for my next order the shipping not to be so high, it really defers me from ordering with the way the economy is these days.<br />Thanks D.G.

review/summary: Tastes ...different
review/text: I tried this almond flavor tonight and found it reminded me of soap. The liquid is thick and merely tasting it in a raw application gave me a slight stomach ache.  I will try this in a baked item to see if perhaps its more suited to that.<br /><br />Right now, this is not compatible with my palate, and I am disappointed because I dislike the flavor of alcohol extracts (again, in raw applications),but will I will play with it and post an update.<br /><br />Otherwise, it arrived quickly and was packed well.<br /><br />UPDATE: I used it in baked goods and it's fine.  We didn't get that soapy taste and we're happy about that.

review/text: I have a 10 yr old & a 7 yr old dog. The 10 yr old will eat anything, the 7 yr old is extremely picky & has a delicate stomach. We were using brands of dog food you find in the grocery store until a trainer opened our eyes to the difference in qualities of dog food & the effect it can have on behavior as well as overall health. There are 2 websites we checked before we chose Premium Edge Healthy Weight II, one was  the Whole Dog Journal 2010 Approved Food List ([...]),the other was Dog Food Analysis ([...]). On both websites this food is recommended. Both dogs absolutely LOVE this food & I feel so much better knowing that they are getting quality food.

review/summary: Good quality, affordable food.
review/text: It's really important to me to feed my pets quality food.  My first dog had severe allergies to food, and all of the vets we took her to caught that.  She had terrible skin rashes, raw hot spots, and constant ear infections--all of which are indications that she had food allergies.  I wish I had had the Internet back then so I could have saved her life.  She eventually ended up getting stomach cancer and dying at the very young age of five.  I truly believe that if we had switched her to a quality food, she could have lived a longer, happier life. It was an important lesson for me to learn, and I will never feed any of my animals sub-par food ever again.<br /><br />I have had my current dog on Natural Balance Ultra Premium as well as Solid Gold Hund n Flocken.  Both of those foods are of good quality, but are also very pricey.  If you would like to do your own research on different food options and brands, [...]and [...]are great sites.<br /><br />Natural Balance, Solid Gold, and Premium Edge have all received 4-star ratings at dog food analysis.  The biggest issue with Premium Edge (and all of Diamond foods--including NB and SG) was the fact that there weren't any written guarantees that they did not use Ethoxyuin as a preservative.  I emailed Diamond foods, and received an email stating that they and their suppliers no longer use Ethoxyquin as a preservative.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Premium Edge.  It is a good quality food and it comes at a much better price for me (on top of being significantly cheaper, the bags are 35lbs as opposed to NB and SG's 33lb. bags).  The final selling point for me is that my dog really LOVES her food now.  With both previous brands, she would eat half of her food and then walk away and eat the rest of it later when she got hungry enough.  With Premium Edge Skin and Coat, she scarfs everything down right away.  She even BEGS me to feed her in the morning and evening now.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy with my choice to switch to Premium Edge.  It's an affordable, good quality dog food, and my dog LOVES it!  I highly recommend giving it a try.  :)

review/summary: Best in Quality and Price
review/text: I was introduced to this dog food over tens years ago. One of the local pet stores recommended it for our golden retriever because of the skin problems that he was experiencing. His skin and coat were back to normal once he had been on this dog food for two weeks. I've been feeding it to all my dogs ever since. I have four dogs now and so the price  on Amazon is really appreciated...Along with the quick delivery. As an aside: My dogs love the taste so much that I have used the kibble as their behavioral treat as well (e.g., sit, stay, etc.) Can't get a better taste review than that!

review/summary: Made my dog's coat shine
review/text: I have been impressed with this dog food, that I started using when I saw it at a local feed store.  It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.  Too bad Amazon appears not to plan to carry this brand any longer.

I put her on this food and it cleared her skin up in less than a month!  I've researched a lot of food online and at the Pet stores and this I believe is the best!

review/text: Decided to purchase the 35 pound bag for my 12 year old dog who have skin allergy base on the positive reviews I've read on line.  Very happy with shipping & Packaging service from Amazon.  But very dissapointed in Premium Edge.  Not only did the food not help him, it seemed to made him worst the first couple of days! Also, the product says for adult dogs but on the package it also says from age 1 to 10 years of age???? My dog is 12.  I don't understand all the positive feed back for this product?  and I so regret for buying such a large bag or the product for that matter.

review/summary: Great value product that is full of protein
review/text: We recently started eating more healthy in our household. We switched to pasture raised chickens and eggs with no antibiotics, no corn feed, no hormones. We also switched to pasture raised beef and hogs. Once again, no hormones, no antibiotics, and no corn feed. What a difference in ease of weight control. Not to mention a lot healthier all the way around. So, it did not take us long to decide to provide a better dog food for our two blue ticked beagles. Since we can not insure that the beef or chickens used in dog food are of the same quality as what we eat, salmon and potatoes are a better choice. Our female has lost 5 pounds from a hefty 40 lbs to 35lbs and has leveled out beautifully. The male has lost 8 pounds and has also leveled out to the vets praise. She was impressed with their progress at 9 years old. My geriatric children love the taste and no longer hesitate around the food bowl. The internet is a wonderful thing and I am so glad we found Premium Edge. It is a high quality dry dog food that is reasonably priced. You can pay more, but you return on investment will be marginal. We have started topping it off with Dogswell canned dog food just to add an extra bit of flavor and our dogs have never been happier.

review/summary: Very good food.
review/text: I've spent years reading labels on dog food bags, trying to establish a balance between good food and a reasonable price. Premium Edge is the answer to this quandary. I confess, I recently strayed to another brand in search of a food that I didn't have to drive thirty miles out of my way to get. On the surface the other food seemed to fit the bill (no wheat or corn). But after a few weeks on the other food, my old hound began shaking his head a lot and two hot spots appeared. I learned the hard way that this particular dog is allergic to soy products.<br /><br />So we've returned to our tried and true Premium Edge and, after two weeks, not only is hound better, but the other dogs' are glowing again (and I didn't even notice the loss of sheen). What a relief to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price and even more reasonable shipping charges.

review/text: My German Wirehaired Pointer had bad doggy BO.  It would return shortly after she was bathed.  My vet thought that it might be due to a food allergy, and suggested we try a food containing ingredients she had not been exposed to previously.  This Premium Edge food filled the bill, and it has reduced the doggy BO to normal levels.  The Amazon price for the food was friendly, and UPS delivered the heavy sack right to my door.  What's not to like?

review/summary: Seems to Be Good Food - Dogs Like It.  Does have an Odor While Other Premium Foods Do Not.
review/text: We have been through 3 brands of dog food over the past 3 years because of price/availability on Amazon.  This is the last (Amazon delivered) brand we tried because our regular brand became unavailable.<br /><br />The Premium Edge Salmon seems to have a quality list of ingredients & seems comparable to the Costco Salmon brand (Costco is slightly cheaper but Costco requires an annual membership fee & Amazon delivers to your doorstep).  The food does have an odor that we didn't find in our other premium foods, and I do not know the source of the odor (we previously have feed our dogs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCWAFY">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Large Breed Adult Canine Formula Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZPFB0">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken & Oats Dry Dog Food, 22.5-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The dogs do not seem to mind the odor & happily chow down on this food (they are slightly picky and, when I was in a food pinch, turned their noses up at Iams).  Their stools are firm & their coats are good & healthy.<br /><br />Because we go through so much dog food (120lbs/month), and because of availability issues that I've had with Amazon in the past, we will be switching to the Costco/Kirkland food.  However, if this is less of a concern for you & if you want your dog food delivered to your doorstep (a real plus), then this is a premium food that is worth trying. Both this brand & the Costco brand is manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods, a company that has had a lot of recalls in the past (in fact, both this food & the Costco food were subject to recall in early 2012).

review/text: The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.

review/summary: Dogs love the food - Premium Edge Skin & Coat Salmon, Pot & Veg
review/text: I have 2 large breeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)

review/text: I didn't plan on writing a review for this product. I mean, it's dog food. I don't eat it! But I read a review or two that complained about dogs getting gas after eating this. I have three dogs: 11.0 pounds, 33 pounds and 96 pounds. I tried to mix like is always suggested, but my dogs just made a mess and picked out the new stuff like they always do. I held out and hoped they'd finish of the old brand, but they didn't, which is par for course with my dogs. (I'm weak.) So I just threw out what little was left of the old stuff and didn't bother mixing anymore. My two smaller dogs had no issues. My larger dog got some horrible gas, like she always does when we go through with food changes, and she seemed a bit bloated and crampy. That lasted about a day or two and she's been fine ever since. Well, old Sadie still has gas from time to time, but that's not uncommon for her size. At any rate, she's always gotten a case of the gas from time to time, just like her daddy (me). My bottom line: My dogs like it, my wife is satisfied with the ingredients, and the price isn't insane. I intend to buy it for awhile and see...

More natural than the natural products.  Couldn't ask for more.  Plus comes in 35# bags not just small.  Definitelt recommend.

review/summary: Superb, top of the line dry dog food
review/text: I got this bag just today. It arrived promptly in a giant box. Opened the box & the bag had no tears, scuffs, or any damage. Perfect condition. I dumped the dry food into my storage box & liked the fact there's no artificial colors. I also liked the small kibble size. It's perfect for any size dog to eat. I mix canned food into the dry & it mixes so much easier with the smaller bites. I add canned tuna or salmon cat food to the dry food. The fish oils seem to be good & healthy for them. Also makes their fur soft & shiney. But, do that only on your own accord, I'm NOT a vet!  My 3 big Labs went bonkers over this stuff. They scarfed it down like it was a hamburger. I got a kick out of them wagging their tails & chowing down on their food so happily. After dinner they drank their water, & went outside as usual. Came back in & were much obliged happy campers. There was no usual rolling around, itching, & scratching all over the place. They were calm, cool, and extremely satisfied & so am I. So I give this a positive 5 STARS!<br />I believe my dogs to have food allergies to the cheap dog foods out there, & will try to keep buying this fantastic food for them.

review/summary: Only Brand I now Recommend
review/text: I have used Premium Edge Lamb Formula dry dog food for years.  While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called "premium" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.  "Lamb meal" contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat.

review/text: I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.  He really likes this food!  Finally, my worried mom's heart can rest.  His skin issues are clearing and he doesn't scratch like he wants to peel off his skin.  I highly recommend if your dog shares these issues... get this food, mix it with some sensitive skin wet food or even salmon... your dog with thank you!

review/text: My dog is 3 and he has been chewing and licking his paws for as long as I can remember.  Probably half his day was spent chewing and licking.  He has had many steroid shots and has been taking claritin twice a day for several months.  Nothing has worked....I decided to try this dog food before taking him to a specialist and it has been amazing.  He has been eating the salmon and potatoes formula exclusively for about a week and a half and now he is hardly ever licking his paws!!!  Today I even skipped his claritin and he has not licked his paws all day.  No more grains for my dog!

review/text: I bought this food for my dog (who has very sensitive skin), and, maybe either a) it is not for him, or, b), I didn't introduce it gradually enough, but, he did develop some vomiting and loose stools when eating (fed him only for about 3 days).  It sounds like fabulous food, with quality ingredients, but, I am afraid to give him any more, since I don't know if he can handle/tolerate it.  I still have about 32 lbs. of this food left at my house :)

review/summary: Not so great..Expiration date soon..
review/text: I decided to try this dry food on my two dogs, because of all the great reviews.<br /><br />However....Neither dog will eat it.  One dog took a couple bites, and refuses to eat it..The other dog wont even take a bite.<br />I tried mixing it with their favorite can food, but this only made matters worse.  They would not even touch it.<br /><br />I was confused about this, since one of my dogs will eat just about anything, while the other will eat dry food mixed with cannned.<br />The reviews were all good, so...<br /><br />I checked the package...And, I think I may have found the answer...There is a last sale date of April 11, 2012....That's only about 6 weeks away.<br />I would never purchase a food that was going to expire so soon, even on sale in a store.<br /><br />I now have a huge bag of dog food in the kitchen..I have tried daily to give each dog a little, but no go.  They will not eat eat it!<br />The pieces are all the same size and color...Not appealing, and there is not even a smell that says "eat me, I am food".  Could be cardboard, judging by<br />the dog's reaction.<br /><br />Kind of hard to return, since it is opened and is 18 pounds of dog food.<br />I have a feeling it is either because the food is so old, or it is tainted.  Dogs can sense when there is a problem with food!<br /><br />Sorry about the bad review...But, This was money that will just end up getting poured into the rubbish.<br />Maybe I was only the unlucky one...Check the last sale dates on your package if any of your dogs wont eat it!<br /><br />I will stick to Pedigree and Mighty Dog..less expensive, not as healthy, but both my dogs love it.<br />I cannot recommend this brand..I have two large dogs, mixed breed and are not usually choosy about what they eat.<br />Except for the Premium Edge, which they give  a paws down to!

review/summary: Like the non-died Tic Tacs
review/text: Tic Tac's in most parts of the world, (I have purchased them in Europe, Australia, South America and Asia) are not colored orange, they are an off white color.  They come in an orange colored plastic box.  In the US, the box is clear and the Tic Tacs are died orange.<br /><br />I personally think the whitish colored, orange flavored Tic Tacs are the best.  They have a more subtle flavor that I prefer.  Also, why do should I eat the unneeded food coloring.  I will admit that eating the food coloring is not a real big issue for me, but the taste of the non-colored tic tacs is what caused me to seek out the non-us varieties.<br /><br />At anyrate I look specificly for the orange contaiered off white colored tic Tac.  Whisch is why I buy them here and not at Costco or Smart and Final

It turns out I had nothing to fear. The tic tacs were orange, not "white in an orange case" (as some reviews have stated) and I opened one and tried to "crush it in my fingers" (as another review stated) I couldn't crust it in my fingers so I popped it in my mouth. It had a nice hard crunch, it was perfectly orange flavored. They are fresh, and orange, and orange tasting. I think they are a great product!

We will not stand for pre-sucked Tic Tacs, no matter their supposed creed, white is NOT what they should start out as. This is an outrage, and I, for one, will not stand for it.<br /><br />PS.) Walmart does not carry mega Tic Tac packs and they suck(but not pre-suck), too.

review/text: Despite the bad reviews mostly due to the color of the tic tacs I placed an order.  My tic tacs arrived orange, but horribly stale.  I was able to crush the tic tac between my fingers with little effort and they had a funny metallic taste to them.  I am something of a Tic Tac connoisseur and these were just uneatable.  I desire the crunchyness of the first bite into the tic tac and these severely lacked this.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods are RECALLED
review/text: This is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.I too love Grain Free dog food and love that the first ingredient is actually the real meat.<br />My baby girl loves "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison mainly.<br />I searched relentlessly for a reasonable priced food that has no by-products, dyes and are grain free. Which my lil' white Maltese needed for her allergies and tear stains.<br />But, now Diamond Dog Food has been RECALLED for "Salmonella"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled too.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying.

review/summary: Salmonella Recall, but if you don't have the UPC off the bag, you're out the money
review/text: Amazon Notified me Diamond Naturals was being recalled due to Salmonella in the Food. Great, I'm glad they told us; yes, a month after we bought the food, but luckily, our dog hasn't gotten to it yet. Diamond Naturals says they will give you a replacement Coupon if you mail them the UPC code off the bag. But what if you do like us, and always dump the food into an airtight container to keep vermin out? Presto-Chango! NO UPC CODE. And What do you do if you also Mix your food with another (higher end) brand? There's 60 bucks worth of dog food there that we now have to throw out. Fantastic. What do you do? Well you contact Diamond Naturals, tell them exactly that, and they respond, by saying "If you don't have the Bag, when in doubt, throw the food out. Since we value you as a customer, we're going to give a coupon for more Diamond Naturals, Just cut the UPC code off the Bag and send it to us." ....Really? Hellooooo? Testing...is this thing on? So you email them back, pointing out again, that it's not possible to send them something you don't have, and again asking... "Hey, what about the other food that's ruined too? I have the record of buying them both on the same day from Amazon."  What happens next? Apparently Nothing. You dump the food in the trash, scrub out the container, and his food bowl just in case, and belly-ache about it here. And end up at Pets-Mart buying a different brand and hoping your dog doesn't get the runs because of the sudden change.

Dogs and cats don't really chew their food, so all they do is pick it up into their mouth and swallow!  And there are different flavors, and sizes just right for kittens, cats, puppies and dogs!

review/summary: Cats crazy about these
review/text: Based on my experience with our six cats, I can't imagine any cat not devouring these. We have a cat with hyperthyroidism who needs a pill twice a day. Two of our other cats routinely run over when its pill time to see if I'll give them a tiny piece of the pill pocket, and the other three non-medicated cats would readily gobble these up too if I let them. Not to mention the cat who is supposed to be getting them. She's normally a whiner (unusual in cats) but loves these and readily takes them twice a day. Before now, we've had cats for many years and periodically had to give one of them pills; this is by far the easiest method I've run across. Good thing if one has have to give a cat pills as frequently as twice every day, indefinitely.

review/text: I loooooooooove this tea! It is simply delicious; I have shared it with many friends, and it's always a hit. Anyone who loves ginger will love it. The Tulsi adds a wonderful depth to the flavour that seems to mix very well with the ginger (I have also ordered the Organic India Tulsi Jasmine tea and was very disappointed; the Tulsi tasted kind of odd... I got used to it, but it was far from 'delicious'.) If you like sweet things, add honey. One word of caution: it takes a little trial and error to get the brewing length right for this tea; if you steep it too long it can (like any ginger tea, in fact) develop an unpleasant bitter taste.

review/summary: UPDATE-Change Not Always Good
review/text: I previously wrote a review for the chicken, so I couldn't update it there. Please see my  Other Reviews , the one for Septmber 30th so you can fully understand my follow-up about the change in ingredients below.<br /><br />Kind of funny, I waited for 3 months to hear back from the manufacturer of Gennies Pill Pockets about their change in their ingredients and since posting this on 9/30, I received an e-mail, finally, on 10/2, coinsidence, maybe. Here is what they stated:<br /><br />"Thank you for contacting Greenies with your inquiry.The only change we have made in the formula for Feline Pill Pockets is an increase in Glycerin to insure moisture content.  There have been no changes to any of the protein sources.Please feel free to contact us anytime! John X. Consumer Quality RepresentativeNutro Products Inc.Please do NOT reply to this email.  If you would like to respond to this message, click on the link below." I changed the customer reps name to John X. to leave her name out of it.<br /><br />I e-mailed them back to inform them of their misinformation and suggested they revert back to the orignal ingredients. There wouldn't be need for extra glycerin if they didn't mess with the original recipe.<br /><br />I guess NO ONE there is aware of what they put or no longer put in their products that our pets eats. Just read for yourself, there is no mention of any type of probiotic. Their statement "Healthy Treat" went by the wayside after they removed the probiotics.<br /><br />With the recent pet food scare, I would want to buy from a manufacturer who is aware of not only where they buy their ingredients, but of every tiny particle that is used in producing their product.<br /><br />So, use your judgement. I will use pill pockets ONLY if I HAVE to medicate.<br /><br />By the way, I gave it 3 stars for pill dosing, not for quality or healthy ingredients.

review/summary: Pill Pockets for Cats
review/text: Pill Pockets are very helpful in getting a cat to take a pill.  The only thing is that they are typically expensive to purchase in stores ($9 for 45 treats).  Luckily, I can pay about half that price online via Amazon or other web retailers.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: Since the Jelly Belly Buttered Popcorn are my favorite Jelly Belly beans, I really expected to pig out with this order. When I first received the box with the beans thats all I got. The beans weren't even placed in a plastic bag before they were put in the box, I didn't find this to be very sanitary. Secondly, more than 1/2 of the beans did NOT look or taste like the Buttered Popcorn at all nor did they have any yellow on them or the Jelly Belly logo. This left me to believe that they were NOT The Buttered Popcorn and maybe not even The Jelly Belly beans that I ordered. I ate them so I have no complaint but I will try NOT to order from this vendor again.

review/text: A few months ago a friend turned me on to a bag of the Mariani Phillipine Mango & I had been hooked! I was excited when I saw that Amazon sold it in bulk, when the order arrived & I opened a bag, I was so disappointed. The variety Amazon carries is the "Mariani Thailand Mango" and the one I went crazy for was the "Mariani Phillipine Mango" there was a HUGE difference in taste & texture. Now I'll have to see who wants the 11 unopened bags I have :(  At least I can buy the ones I like at my local Jewel Food Store.

review/summary: I Love Natur's Hallow's Sugar Free Honey Substitute!!!!!
review/text: This stuff has a  really really great taste!!!!!!  At first, I was a bit worried about what it was going to taste like by the Reviews that were posted here on Amazon.com.  But like most things, everyone has different taste buds, and what one person might dislike, another might love.  So, I gave it a try, and I found that I really like the taste of this honey substitute.  One of the the first things I tried Nature's Hallow Honey Substitute on was a piece of buttered toast Wow! I was really surprised.  So, I had to have another piece, but this time I added cinnamon (King Arthur's Vietnamese Cinnamon, which was also was another new product for me.) Wow WOW. . . .that was the best Cinnamon Honey Toast ever.<br /><br />Now, I did personally feel that this product mimicked the texture of Honey. . .and If any one has tried different varieties of honey, they know that honey comes in a variety of taste and texture.  I myself prefer a lighter tasting HONEY, and I felt for me this Honey Substitute mimicked that very closely.  No it was not completely Honey in texture, but close. . . .<br /><br />I know there are going to be others, who will not agree with me and that's OK. . .But those of you who have not tried Nature's Hallow Honey Substitute, please don't let the negative reviews stop you from at least trying it once.  I think some of you will be pleasantly surprised, and in a good way.<br /><br />My next plans are to bake with Nature's Hallow Sugar Free Honey Substitute, and hopefully it will replace honey and Agave Nectar in recipes where it is asked for. . .It's worth the try!!!!!!!

review/summary: Doesn't Fool Me!
review/text: I am in the OWL phase of Atkins (Ongoing Weight Loss)and started missing Greek Yogurt with honey, thought this would be great to put on my Oikos yogurt.  After reading a good review from another customer who used it for this exact purpose I thought I could not go wrong, but boy I sure did.  I really don't understand how anyone can say this tastes like honey!  I know I have been sugar-deprived for about 3 months now but this has ABSOLUTELY no honey flavor to me at all.  It is sweet and syrupy but doesn't have any taste whatsoever.  So if you are doing low-carb and craving a honey flavor, pass this one up.  If you just want something sweet on your toast or in your yogurt, save your $$ and use the sugar-free pancake syrup, at least it has an actual flavor.  I will wait until I am in maintenance phase & go back to the real honey, just use less.

review/summary: Weak Flavor
review/text: I bought a bottle of this product, along with a bottle of Natrazyle Kosher Honey Substitute, for a side-by-side comparison with the Honey Tree Imitation Honey I currently use. This product did not have the slightly slimy appearance and "mouth-feel" I experianced with the Natrazyle. However, it still lacked the strong honey flavor of the Honey Tree. Although it does not cause the gas "problem" with excess consumption, I will stay with the Honey Tree. Note: I have used Honey Tree instead of Karo syrup to make almond-crusted pecan pies. It produces a pronounced gas effect, as I always eat large slices of pecan pie. I intend to make a pecan pie with this product and if I believe it is better than the Honey Tree pies, I will report back.

This Cayenne pepper is Outstanding!<br /><br />Be aware, this is not the wimpy Cayenne you would buy at the grocery store.  This stuff is really hot - and that is exactly what I have been looking for.  I have a very high tolerance for heat.  I literally use Tabasco sauce for salad dressing.

review/summary: It's not just hot
review/text: I've recently gone on a health kick.  One of my new regimens is taking cayenne pepper on a daily basis.  I knew the small grocery store containers wouldn't be very economical for my purpose and had also read that the hotter the pepper the better so I went straight to Amazon.  Of all of the different offerings I found, this one seemed to be the best deal.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered it but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.  It came in two separate mylar bags of 1lb. each.  The bags aren't resealable so I had to put it into another container. I found that one bag fits perfectly into a 1 quart Mason jar.  I will say that taking cayenne pepper all by itself is not an easy thing to do, but I'm getting used to it.  It helps that this pepper has an excellent flavor.  It's not all heat.  So, whether you are using it in a recipe, making your own hot sauce or taking it as a daily supplement, I think you will be satisfied with the flavor and heat of Frontier's ground chili peppers.  And the price is hard to beat.<br /><br />For those of you who are new to taking cayenne pepper as a daily supplement or are considering it, here's my experience:  The first time I tried it I used 1tsp. in 8oz. of warm water as a sort of tea as I had read on several different natural health forums.  I found that it was way too hot for me and 8oz. of it was a lot more than I could make myself drink.  My next attempt was 1tsp. dumped on the back of my tongue and washed down with plenty of cold water.. around 16oz.  I found that this was bearable, but that a full teaspoon was a lot to swallow. Much of it fell to the side between my cheek and gums... not pleasant.  I have since reduced the amount to 1/2tsp and found this to be optimum for me.  Surprisingly, there were no ill affects such as heartburn or reflux for me and have read that it will cure stomach ulcers.  My only warning is not to take it on an empty stomach.  My wife did that the first time she tried it and I'm not sure if I'll ever get her to try it again.

review/summary: Very Hot Cayenne Pepper
review/text: If you are looking for cayenne pepper that really packs a punch, this is it.  I have been taking cayenne to try and improve blood circulation to my hands and feet.  I have Type 1 diabetes and am concerned about the long term effects of this disease.  Honestly I hate taking this stuff, but I definitely feel the benefits I am looking for, not sure if it is improved blood circulation or the anti-inflammatory properties of cayenne....or if these 2 properties go hand in hand, but my hands, feet and overall body condition feels consistently better (except for the discomfort of the first 20 minutes) when I take my daily morning dose.<br /><br />Here is what I do.  I put about an inch of warm water in a glass, add about a teaspoon of honey, then I add about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, then add about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne (90K SHU), stir and....gulp!<br /><br />I only use a little bit of water so that I can gulp it down.  The honey and the lemon juice mask some of the power of the pepper.  I have heard that you build up a tolerance to this stuff...I have been taking this for about a month now, daily, and I have not been able to move beyond a 1/4 teaspoon without painful consequences.<br /><br />Good luck in your pursuit of health!

review/text: I haven't ordered this 16 ounce bag, so can't vouch for that, but will say I think one should be careful when opening it, because this pepper is HOT! Try not to breathe... I've had a jar that I just finished of this pepper, and had it for 10 years and it was HOT HOT HOT until the very end. I can't even believe I had it that long, but you only need a little bit, and I have a high tolerance for spicy hot foods. Seriously, why bother with any other brand. Desperate for more cayenne, I recently purchased the only brand they had at a near by supermarket, and need to return it. It's not hot at all. Frontier is awesomely great!!!

This cayenne has a nice sweet fruitiness coupled with the heat which I really dig.<br /><br />For those of you who are not used to a lot of heat, go easy on yourself at first and gradually work up to more or you might be visiting the toilet in a tumultuous rush.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that this is not organic. Why is it that all of the super hot cayenne is non-organic? Is it because the peppers are so hot that they repel bugs naturally and are already 'organic' by proxy of their natural repellent factor?

review/summary: SCAT Squirrels !!!
review/text: I put Cayenne pepper on bird seed to keep squirrels away from the feeders.  (Use a mask and gloves to sprinkle the Cayenne over the seeds and mix well; add to feeder.)  The birds have different  glands than  mammals (squirrels are mammals!).  The birds are NOT affected by the hot at all; they don't taste it.  Main problem is that when it rains some of the cayenne is washed off and then you'll see a squirrel occasionally until you refill the feeder .... but this has sure saved on my sunflower seed expenditures!!  I only use about a tablespoon or so to a feeder-full of seed.

review/summary: A Pep to your step
review/text: After reading about the benefits of chili peppers I decided to give it a try. So, I did what most people do, I did a search and I came across this company and this product. I couldn't pass up the price, It comes in 2 big bags, but even more impressive than the price was the delivery. I got home a few days after my order and to my surprise I had received my package. It was extremely fast delivery - that is always a plus.<br /><br />The pepper itself, I never leave reviews, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity, this stuff is HOT, I have had other chili pepper, but this stuff packs a serious punch. If you are looking for a little zest and looking to add this to your diet, meals, or life, don't pass this up because I love hot stuff and even this is passing up my expectations.<br /><br />In fact, I just had some veggies with this on it. The other night I was eating and put a good amount on my soup. I started to sweat. So, I have to say if you are going back and forth on this, you should go ahead and order, you won't be disappointed, I know I'm not.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

review/summary: Exactly what I wanted, you wont find this at your local mart
review/text: First off I thought I ordered 2 bags that equaled out to 1lb but was pleasantly surprised that it was actually 2 1LB bags for a total of 2LBs of surprisingly hot and flavorful cayenne. The stuff in the grocery store is reportedly 30,000 SKU or less and this powder knocks what I have bought in the past, out of the park.<br /><br />I bought this mainly for cayenne's rich health benefits and am making a tincture with it as well as eating 3tsps a day. Cayenne pepper especially at 90,000 SKU can really help lower your blood pressure, improve circulation, stop profuse bleeding, gives energy, increases metabolism, can stop a heart attack in its tracks, and many other benefits. Google it if you don't believe it, some see it as one of the most beneficial foods to cook with and have in your house. Anyways enough homeopathic babble.....<br /><br />Bottom line is this stuff has GREAT flavor much better than other store bought kinds I have purchased and really packs the heat! I put half a table spoon in my chicken noodle soup as I have done in the past with store bought brands and boy did I regret it haha if you don't have a heat tolerance and are taking this as a daily supplement I would suggest starting with 1/8 of a tea spoon in 8ozs of warm water and working your way up to 1 tsp 3 times daily for max effects. In comparison to fresh pepper heat I would rather nibble down a habanero or Thai dragon chili both ranking around 100,000 SKU than a table spoon of this stuff like I did in my soup, not to say its bad cayenne but just that a little powder goes a long ways and that's what makes this such a GREAT deal!<br /><br />If you are looking to spice up dishes, watch out for your health, or use it for any number of other uses then this is the cayenne for you. This stuff is HOTTTT and you will not be disappointed or find a hotter cayenne pepper powder for this price on Amazon!

review/text: I added this strength to my bird feeeders & IT WORKS GREAT!!!!<br />For years I fought the battle & used the "little packets" for bird feeders BUT saw this in a review for this item & what a savings I have now on bird seed!<br />NO IT DOES NOT harm birds as they have no saliva glands~~aren't we lucky?<br />NO you do not need on safflower feeder or thistle as squirrels do not like bitter taste.<br /><br />Look it up on Google & you will see where it is not harmful to them.<br />If a squirrel gets on feeder give him 5 minutes & you will not see him on it again that day-amen.<br />Well worth the price & add accordingly.<br />Mix in well with a big tool/spoon & a plastic bag on arm & keep your face away from mixing...glasses on if any doubt.<br />Wash hands well after...enjoy keeping your feeders squirrel free~~hooray...chipmunks too.<br />Happy Feeding!

review/summary: We're talking serious heat here
review/text: I thought I knew what heat was until I put a couple teaspoons of this into a can of beans. Wow. Respect. And after doing a little research on the benefits that cayenne pepper has on the body, I now use this product everyday in a tea or mix with water and drink it down(Fire water-lol). I give this product 5 stars for sure.

review/summary: Very good, fresh and hot pepper
review/text: The Frontier Chili Peppers come well ground, in 2 tightly sealed 1 lb plastic bags. The pepper is very hot, and my only problem was obtaining a container to hold the pepper after opening the bag. We use it as part of our buffalo wing recipe, and this is by far the best pepper we've had for the task. This is very finely ground almost to the point of being a powder.

review/text: This cayenne has a nice taste and plenty of heat. I would have appreciated a resealable package, however.  This comes in a bag that needs to be cut open and is not resealable.

review/summary: potato beetle deterrent
review/text: Sprinkle on potato plants where beetles are feasting and the feast is over.  The beetles scatter and nolonger find the plant quite so attractive.  It has also been effective against other bugs on other plants, but not useful where you intend to eat the leaves.

review/text: I bought this for the health benefits but it's hard to tell the benefits since I'm healthy anyway! The taste is great though. I can put about 3/4 tsp in my breakfast yogurt with 3/4 tsp cinnamon and some organic, non-alkali cocoa, stevia, and I've got most of my bases covered. The price is great too.

review/summary: Hot and Fresh Cayenne
review/text: Great deal on this cayenne pepper. Way more powder than I expected. Very hot, and very fresh. I will buy more from this seller when I run out (which could be quite a while). I bring this to work to put on all my food, since it's supposed to be good for your heart. Great packaging and quick shipping.

review/summary: O M G this is HOTTTTTTT but I LOVE it!
review/text: I use habanero pepper in a lot of my dishes but boyyy, this cayenne pepper is HOT! I am known for loving hot and spicy stuff! I used it for the first time last night and I think I underestimated the "90,000 HU." I poured in close to 1/4 of a cup (did not measure the amount) to what I was cooking and I can barely eat it without having to drink water and chew on crackers. It was as hot as "blazing" wings from Buffalo wild wings. And this might be TMI but whenever I ate this dish I cooked and I did a #1, I felt the tingling sensation as if the pepper in my mouth. So my conclusion is I think a little goes a long way.
